you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
Coolermaster hey guys welcome to my
continuing coverage of CES 2019 I am not
in Las Vegas again I am still here in my
studio that I have a new case from
fantex this is the eclipse P 600 s let
me start by thanking my sponsors for CES
2019 coolermaster Corsair inter max and
deep cool and last year in 2018 at
Computex fantex had a couple new cases
they had the evolve X which got a lot of
attention and they did launch in limited
numbers last year and then there was
this which was sitting over in the
corner the P 600 s it was a very
prototype early version of it but it got
a lot of people's attention and folks
have been asking about it and fantex was
supposed to launch it in December it got
pushed back a little bit but I have a
retail box version now I believe this is
a white one and I'm excited for a new
case in the Eclipse lineup because if
you compare this to like the P 400 it's
a very good case for a very reasonable
price and I'm hoping that continues with
the P 600 s I don't have pricing or
availability right now but if I do maybe
it'll pop up on screen over there
in either case I'm going to take this
out of the box give you guys a first
look at it this front panel is held on
by magnets and apart from its hanging
loose in the box the unboxing experience
felt pretty premium you have nice closed
cell foam on the packaging it's held
together by cardboard which is maybe a
unique in-between cost-saving measure
for that and we have this nice accessory
kit that says thank you for choosing
appendix our accessory kit includes a
book about the case something about our
may requests in contacting fantex
directly looks like we have some
individual drive caddies I feel like it
says a lot about a case when you look at
the drive expansion caddies whether
you're talking three and a half or two
and a half inch drives the cheap ones
are made of plastic and there's not much
thought put into them these are fully
wraparound they have a little bit of
foam padding on one side of them and it
looks like we have mounts for both two
and a half inch or three and a half inch
drives for drive trays total are
included rounding things out we got a
fan text case badge we got some zip ties
we have a plastic container with
individually separated screws standoffs
and other accessories can't say how much
I appreciate that fantex does this and
then we have these three mysterious
pieces which
I'm not really sure what they do but I'm
sure I'll figure it out as I move along
I know this is supposed to support two
systems with an ITX mount in the top so
I'm guessing these are to mount one of
those I figured out these last three
accessories with help from the manual
very nice manual also by the way full
color with like different things and the
different setups you can have water
cooling air cooling storage this is an
airflow cover so if you're mounting top
radiators and you can support two 140s
or three 120 s at the top you can put
this the front of the back or wherever
you might want to block air flow to
direct the air that does go through
through your radiator this is a vertical
GPU month so it mounts right down here
so you can do a vertical GPU it does not
include the razor cable though so you
have to buy that separately and then
this is a GPU sag support bracket I
don't know exactly how it works but
probably goes like there somewhere all
right guys I have read through the
manual and now I think I'm ready to give
you sort of a once-over of this case
explain the ins and outs and how things
work and kind of what things are made
for so as you can see this is the white
version with black accents got a bit of
a stormtrooper feel to it I suppose as
all black and white shiny things will
have forever now but it's a full sized
case it supports ATX and ATX
motherboards and as mentioned it does
support dual systems in the same way
that the evolved X does it's got a
separate panel back here where you can
put an ITX system at the top does
require a separate bracket for that that
is sold separately though so bear that
in mind and of course you're gonna deal
with the thermal potential issues of
having two systems in the same case
which may or may not work out for you
depending on what you're doing with
those systems but of course then you
would also want the fantex PSU adapted a
look that allows you to power two
systems with the same power supply power
supply mounts down here at the bottom
pretty standard it does have a dust
filter attached to it down there pretty
easy to reach back here you can see one
of the pre-installed hundred and forty
millimeter fans these have sliders so
you can move them up and down a little
bit and then it's got three vertical
expansion slots there if you do use the
vertical riser card up here is the
Front's IO it flips up like that and
then you've got a USB 3.1 gen2 type-c
port as well as a couple USB 3.0 ports
there's also a reset button right there
as well as a mic and headphone jack the
power button is up here on top now the
panels on this case like this front
panel here are very they're heavy the
metal they're using is pretty thick and
it's got sound damping
behind there as well and the edges are
wrapped around so very rigid it's held
on by magnets and then fantex actually
has a mesh or fabric dust filter up here
in the front and I'm sure that's going
to require some further testing to see
how effective it is it looks like it's
pretty effective a dust how much air
does it actually block though will be an
important thing but imagine what both of
those together you wouldn't hear much at
out of the front of the system and there
are some vents along the edges as well
to pull some other fresh air in - so
you're not just completely relying on
this front filter which what this piece
on is pretty blocked there's a similar
piece up on top not exactly the same but
same general design and then that is
where the exhaust would be for your
radiators if you had a top radiator and
again 2 by 140 or 3 by 120 in the top 3
by 120 or 3 by 140 in the front and then
a 120 or 140 at the back as far as
radiator support now I always appreciate
a side panel that you can remove easily
and this one's easy to open
you just reach up there and pull it
again held by magnets and then you can
lift it off here as well however mine
really does not lift off very easily
this is also propped up on a very wobbly
lazy susan so that's not helping me at
all
and there I popped it off I'm imagining
that's just a tooling issue maybe for
manufacturing I'm gonna tell fantex
about that there is some additional foam
padding around the sides here though
it's actually the grooved chain that you
have for like weather proofing in a home
kind of but I imagine that's gonna help
prevent vibration when the case is
closed and then also probably help leaky
air from going in or out here's a better
look at the inside of the case we have
two pre-installed 140 millimeter fantex
fans up there at the front these black
things are cable covers and they
actually can be slid one way or the
other so as you're doing a cable
management back there you can leave
those on or you can remove those if you
remove those you have the option to
mount hard drive trays back there there
are mounts for those and actually you
can get additional hard drive caddies if
the for that it ships with aren't enough
for you you can also stack two of these
gauges together and then you can mount
that in there together so you could have
up to eight 3.5 inch drives up here and
then on the other side I've been
wondering what this little ribbon is
that's just a pull tab pulling that out
though lets you remove the other side
panel and this one is metal not tempered
glass in case you didn't notice
unfortunately
it's having the same sticky problem
coming off this is the tempered glass
one did that one was a little bit easier
and here's the business end of the case
up here's reparse Vigo you got two more
mounting points for these drive cages
down here at the bottom so you have a
more forward position or a further back
position
you can also mount a universal pump
mount down here although that is not
included with the case on this side you
have cable management's via velcro
straps so you can just undo that to
write your cables through they actually
doubled up so you've got strappy parts
on either side of this as well as a
couple more crafts there's at the bottom
three 2.5 inch drive mounts right here
with included metal trays once again and
those are just held on by rubber
grommets and then up in the top left you
have an included fan hub one is a sense
cable that you plug into your
motherboard it says it can accept either
PWM or voltage control and then the hub
is actually smart enough to translate so
if you have PWM and voltage controlled
fans connected it'll translate your rpm
control from your motherboard and send
out the right signal to either one oh
one other thing this GPU anti-sag
bracket actually attaches back here so
it's one of the ones that holds the GPU
on this side so holds the tab sturdy so
that you don't get sag on the other side
you can take the top of the case off
pretty easily with a couple thumb screws
here at the back and the entire thing
just lifts off and then here's that top
bracket again held with a couple thumb
screws so there's some cable routing
options here there is a fill port hole
right there and again this bracket can
hold up to 320 millimeter or 240
millimeter fans and this is where this
panel can pop on with some magnets to
block air where you don't want air to
flow here's a look at the bottom of the
case just a single dust filter and then
you got some rubber pads on the bottom
of the feets the power supply mount does
have a gap right here so your power
supply would show through if you have a
fancy one and you want the label to be
visible and finally the front piece
which pulls off in a very similar way to
lots of front pieces on computer cases
this is actually a pretty solid piece
altogether itself at the metal frame
here and then plastic in there as well
this is the removable dust filter this
is the fabric filter so not sure how
this is gonna affect actual airflow
performance but I do appreciate the
ability to have dust filters rather than
not and again behind this the 240
millimeter we included intake fans and
then they also have a drain port right
down there at the bottom although I
don't know
accessible that is given that it's gonna
be behind this I guess it's somewhat
accessible all right one other random
thing I noticed in my initial look is
that if you have this cover on the top
to block and direct your airflow the top
here has two little tabs that the fabric
mesh is kind of stretched around and
that conflicts with that piece so you
can't top on all the way isn't that
great it's the same thing I was just
talking about just the view from the
other side these are the tabs kind of
widget not really so guys that is my
unboxing overview and first look at the
new Fant XP 600 s a long-awaited case
and I kinda have mixed feelings about it
I do like the finished look I really
like what they've done with the metal
throughout and it feels really solidly
built it's like a tank especially the
metal pieces when you pull them off you
can just you're like wow I can I could
hurt someone with this there's also a
ton of space and flexibility inside
whether you're looking for an air-cooled
build or water-cooled build and I do
like the option for all the dust filters
that we have everywhere just gonna be a
question of how much those are gonna
affect actual air flow and for that it's
gonna require but further testing and
maybe somebody who's actually gonna put
a system inside it as well I already
made my complaint since I was going over
the system but just to reiterate I would
like it if these side panels could be
lifted off the hinges a lot more easily
and definitely this plastic cover that
is shown in the manual to be placeable
in the place where I put it shouldn't
cause a conflict with reinstalling the
top of the case that said these issues
could probably be addressed by fantex
for future runs of this case so
hopefully that's something they can fix
in the future I'll be looking forward to
people actually putting systems together
in this I think an epic water-cooled RGB
system classy of course classy RGB would
be great to see in there too so guys let
me know what you think in the comments
section down below about the new fan
Tech's Eclipse P 600 s also a huge thank
you to my sponsors for CES 2019
