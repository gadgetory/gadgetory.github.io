hardware this is my review video on the
fractal define r4 computer case and I'm
reviewing the windowed side panel
edition thing is I haven't actually
built anything in this computer case yet
I haven't done much more than doing an
overview video for it over on our newegg
TV youtube channel that's my day job so
if you want to see all these specs and
some detailed close-ups and some very
fancy camera work with this particular
case you can check that out it's
available on our newegg TV youtube
channel what i'm going to be doing today
is actually building a system in this
case so i will be returning to you guys
very shortly to provide you my feedback
and my thoughts on the actual build
process and also some more information
on that build is going to be available
in another video on my channel i hope
this isn't all getting too confusing but
i will be right back probably tomorrow
is when I will shoot the review part of
this video I'm going to go ahead and do
my build in the fractal design hard for
and I Beck and as you can see my build
is now complete I'm happy to say it went
off without a hitch and all of my
initial thoughts about the fractal
define r4 we're pretty much verified as
i went to the build process so i'm gonna
give you guys a closer look at that well
I talked about some of my pros and cons
of this case and the built first off of
course build quality and that is
something that fractal is definitely
doing a really good job with throughout
the case you'll notice very sturdy and
reinforced panels all the way through
you typically do not see much bowing or
flexing as you're working with the case
and one thing about the side panels on
the case in particular typically I don't
like these types of side panels that
kind of have the hooks along on top on
the bottom and you lay it up flatten and
slide it into place usually that's
because with lower build quality those
side panels flex and Bend and it's a lot
harder to get them back on and lined up
properly however with this case because
again build quality is there the side
panels do slide on and off without too
much trouble at all second thing to
point out is space there's just tons of
it in this case I was installing an e
ATX motherboard even though this case is
not necessarily verified to fit that
size however it was able to fit it part
of the reason is because there is some
space between the motherboard tray and
the drive cages a bit of an extra gap
there so even though I covered up the
grommets that you're supposed to use I
was able to still route the cables
through that gap and get them all hooked
up properly another thing is the
grommets themselves I did use a few of
them especially at the top the
thoughtful one they put at the top
middle was very helpful for me and they
really had quality they stay in place
I've worked with some cases before where
when you try to push the cable through
the grommet and then you're cinching it
down it just pulls the grommet off of
the routing goal that's all as a pain in
the butt never happened with this case
also plenty of space behind the
motherboard tray so even if you're
routing cables over the top of the
24-pin motherboard may motherboard power
connector for example is still plenty of
space to do that and even with side
panel on really wasn't any trouble at
all another good point here is that
they've provided you with two positions
for the top 240 millimeter radiate your
position the reason is if you position
it in the middle it looks a little bit
more symmetrical however I was really
really happy that they put the second
position for it which is spaced a little
bit further away from the motherboard
tray because I would not have been able
to use this configuration if they did
not so I thought that was really
thoughtful it's just as much as adding a
couple more holes to the top of the case
to give you another mounting position
for it but do the heatsinks that are on
my gigabyte motherboard there's really
just about no clearance between the
radiator and the motherboard they're
almost right up against each other if I
didn't have that second position I would
not have been able to install in this
configuration and I would have either
had to go with a thinner radiator or
thinner fans but I can least confirm
that this motherboard fits in this case
this radiator the third will take water
to point out fits in this case with this
motherboard but your mileage may vary
don't assume this is good fit with every
motherboard is going to depend on the
heatsink sit around the motherboard
itself and what kind of clearance you
have the top of that motherboard as
opposed to whatever radio radiator
you're using so I might recommend it a
thinner radiator for this case such as
h100 as opposed to this one that I use
here or just make sure that your
motherboard doesn't have too much going
on up at the top edge of it one other
thing I wanted to point out is that they
did do the thoughtful addition of adding
a couple 2.5 inch SSD mounting points of
the back of the motherboard tray I did
not end up using those the reason was
because I felt 22 locked in if I was
going to use those mounting points
because pretty much if you mount a
motherboard might ask to stay at the
back and screw it in then put your
motherboard in you have to remove your
motherboard to remove that SSD and since
I tend to swap drives around it just
wasn't going to make sense for me so I
skipped that I just mounted it up in the
front for now and I have a bunch other
drives I'm probably gonna end up
dropping in here also if you guys
noticed i guess some of the rest of the
hardware in here i got the inner max
climax in there also got an asus gtx 670
video card which you can see there looks
really nice through the side panel
window with the heat pipes on it and I
guess that's pretty much all i have to
say i would apprec
if they may be took those 2.5 inch drive
point drive mount points behind the
motherboard tray just did the little pop
out with some some mounting points tears
that way you can mount it from the side
rather than through the back of the
motherboard tray that might solve that
problem allow you to still have those
handy mounting points back there and
because I think we're really going for
that is if you use those and just use
the lower drive cage here you can remove
that middle one and get the extra
airflow but yeah that's just my only
thought really my only quibble about
this case that I could I could seriously
come up with so yeah pretty much
verified all my original thoughts
excellent case I'm going to give it a
nine out of 10 for my overall rating but
that is going to do it for this video
this has been my review of the fractal
define r4 mid tower computer case with
the side panel window I'm Paul you've
been watching Paul's hardware will see
you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
