Pauls hardware i am absolutely ecstatic
to be bringing you guys this video today
because this video this one right here
is my cpu cooler showdown video yes that
is correct I finally have produced this
video I've run all my tests I've got my
numbers and I'm sharing them with you
guys right here right now or at least in
a few moments after I've rambled for a
little while about about what I have
written down here in this paper I'm
trying to keep things organized so first
off a little bit of history here because
this has been a project I've been
working on for quite some time if you
want to get specific almost 4 months ago
was when I first did the water 2.0
extreme unboxing over you and at that
point the idea crept into my head that
oh maybe I should take this cooler
test against some other ones it out
there and if it's any indication there's
actually a water 3.0 extreme available
from thermal take now so this one's
still out there - from what I've read
they're both very similar but anyway
from the water to point out extreme i
also added on the h2 20 and h1 10 and
then the most recent addition was the
Coolermaster iceberg 240 l prestige i
should say this is the swift tech h 220
the corsair h 110 the idea for this
video was to take a bunch of high-end
closed-loop water coolers basically to
find ones that were better than your
typical 240 millimeter radiator whether
via thicker radiators or using different
materials or a larger radiator and to
sort of pit those against each other and
see if you wanted to go beyond 240 what
your options were and watch what was
going to get you the best performance
now I've learned a ton throughout the
creation of this video because I'll be
upfront and say that's a apart from
doing some air cooler testing here and
there I've really never attempted to
take multiple water cooling units and
pit them against one another to see what
kind of performance they got another
thing that I learned is that if you're
going to be testing CPU cores it's best
not to wait until like the dead middle
of the summer when it's just about as
hot as it's going to get in order to do
that ambient temperatures do play a
factor I am testing here in my apartment
and you guys can't see everything but
there's no air conditioning in this room
so when the temperature is
is in outside it rises in here a little
bit too so I have corrected all of my
results to 22 degrees Celsius
I've normalized all the temperatures so
you can get still the same basis for
comparison but if you're going for an
aggressive overclock middle of the
summers might not be the most ideal time
next up I'm going to move into a quick
sort of mini review of each one of these
coolers and I've done unboxings of each
of them already and as I go into this
mini review you might notice I'm leaning
towards the negative side I'm going to
point out stuff that I saw that I wasn't
super happy with so right from the
get-go I want to point out all of these
coolers are fantastic all of them
performed really well and I never ran
into anything that I would call a game
destroying bug or something like that
all of these work just fine I'm going to
point out some small issues here and
there that you might want to take into
consideration if you're looking into
purchase each one of them so as that
said let's go ahead and get started with
the Corsair H 110 now the courser h 110
is a 280 millimeter radiator so this is
the larger radiator but not thicker it's
pretty standard otherwise the larger
radiator radiator does limit your case
options so bear that in mind when you're
looking for a case if you are going to
get this cooler make sure that you get
one that supports the 280 millimeter rat
apart from that this is om 2 by ace Tech
which is a company in China which makes
a lot of the closed-loop CPU coolers
this has the standard ACE tech mounting
system and I will point out that the
east tech mounting system is
middle-of-the-road in my book when it
comes to CPU cooler mounting solutions
after Mark's aftermarket CPU mounting
solutions tend to be difficult as a
general rule on this one it's not
terrible if they do give you some
adhesive so you can apply this plate to
the back of the motherboard the biggest
issue potentially that I saw is if
you're installing this on socket 775
1155 1156 or 1150 / 1366 for that matter
the metal plungers in here when they're
actually screwed in from the other side
of the motherboard if you do over
tighten those they can twist around in
the plastic bracket at the back here and
it can kind of strip out that socket and
you know just keep twisting it over and
over again it's happened to me once and
I've talked to some other people it's
happened to so bear that in mind if you
are doing this instantly
and apart from that I did want to point
out that the H 110 was the quietest
cooler in the roundup and I'm talking
about the low temp out of the load the
load noise when I talking about the
noise generator here I also want to say
I'm when it comes to noise comparisons
amongst all these that's one thing that
I will be including in future reviews is
a more scientific means of measuring the
actual noise generated for this review
I'm going to give my subjective just
what I've heard and what I felt was
louder and not as loud but I'm I'm gonna
that's that's one of the things I've
learned throughout this process and I'm
hopefully going to be improving in the
future getting an actual set up to
measure the decibel sound pressure which
would be nice next up is the thermal
take water 2.0 extreme and this one has
a 240 millimeter radiator but it is
thicker than your typical radiator which
is 25 millimeters thick this one is 38
millimeters of just over 38 millimeters
thick the water 2.0 extreme features USB
control so you can actually feed a usb
down to the header on your motherboard
it also gives you the ability to monitor
the liquid temperature in the loop which
is a nice feature to have this also is
om 2 by 8 a stick so this one features
that same mounting system as the H 110
again not the worst but it does have
that same potential to possibly strip
the threads or the plastic backplate if
you over screw it and the other thing is
that this one was the loudest cooler in
the roundup this is a relative
measurement it wasn't crazy loud or
anything like that and of course you do
have the option to lower the fan speed
if you choose to so that is amenable but
at the speeds that I was tested testing
at which is 60%
and 100% fan speed the water 2.0 did
strike me as amongst the louder in the
roundup the next cooler is the Swift
tech H 220 so a closer look at that one
will reveal that this one is very
customized so Swift tech does a higher
end water cooling stuff so they've done
a lot of work developing this particular
one they designed it themselves
this is 240 millimeters again but this
one features copper in the radiator
itself and copper just by virtue of
physical properties of the elements
copper is able to absorb and disperse
the heat more efficiently than the
aluminum fins of say the water 2.0 or
the h1 10 the other thing about the h2
20 is that it as it is an expandable
loop which means if you purchase this if
you if you do want to expand it in the
future and make your own custom loop the
pump is very strong so you can actually
adapt it to add on another radiator to -
you can add a reservoir to the loop for
example you can get your tubing in there
and kind of make a custom loop so it's a
starting half point that's kind of an
upsell feature that this one is also one
of the more expensive ones in the
roundup so that's also something to bear
in mind but if you are looking to get
into water cooling but you don't
necessarily want to invest in a whole
custom loop right off the bat that's a
nice option for you I will say that the
pump is fairly loud on the h2 20 but it
is PWM controllable so if you have
motherboard fan control options you can
use those PWM controls to lower the RPMs
of the pump which does lower the amount
of noise it generates as well and then
the helix fans that are included with
the h2 20 are excellent they have a
really wide rpm range from 800 to 1800
rpms and they are more tuned towards
silence than they are towards cooling
which i think is why some other testing
at that Linus's test for example when he
swapped out the helix fans on h2 20 was
some knocked to nff twelves he was able
to drastically improve the performance
but it does run a nice and quiet
especially if you lower down the RPMs of
the fan so it's 60% percent it was the
quieter of the the coolers in this
roundup well but that pretty much wraps
up for a mini review of the h2s what I
did want to say also that the backplate
on the h2 20 is full metal and
impossible to strip so I did like that
feature and it does also provide some
adhesive to stick it on there so that
you can line it up properly when you're
doing the mounting next up we have the
cooler master iceberg 240 L prestige
this is one of the newer ones that's
come out again we have a more custom
design from cooler master as opposed to
some of the ACE tech and cool the cool
it designs that we've seen from a lot of
the other water coolers out there cooler
master has again much like the h20
designed this to be an expandable loop
if you decide to so you have again a
combo block
pump and reservoir all
one that fits on top of the CPU and has
a little window in it which lets you
look in there and make sure that you got
liquid going in there and everything
which is kind of nice although it's
difficult to see when it's actually
installed it has some while winding
around the tubing which helps prevent
kinking which is also a nice little
feature along with the thermal take
water 2.0 this was one of the louder
coolers in the roundup although again I
will say all these coolers you can
adjust the fan speeds using your
motherboards software and that can
drastically reduce the noise that's
generated and then I also wanted to
point out that I was not super impressed
with the mounting system for the 240 L
prestige at least if you're going with a
socket 1155 1156 or 1150 solution you're
actually good you'll just have these
little plastic plugs that pop through
the motherboard
there is no backplate it's easy but when
the plugs are installed you pretty much
need to be able to hold on to the back
of the play the plug on the motherboard
then in order to mount these threaded
screws from the other side that you
actually mount the pump with it's it's
not the best but I would recommend if
you're getting any of these coolers here
definitely make sure your case not only
supports the radiator itself but also
make sure that the case has a open
backplate on your motherboard so you can
actually access the back of your CPU
mounting area but that's all for the
mini review let's go ahead and move on
to the performance testing area of this
video and I'm going to start off with
giving you a quick rundown of the test
bed that I'm using I am testing in an
enclosed system so it's more of a real
world experience not an open test bed
I'm using this case right over here
which is the NZXT phantom 630 I chose
the 630 because I will to close case
first of all it's a real case so you can
buy and I needed something that would
fit a variety of colors including 240
millimeter as well as 280 millimeter for
the CPU I'm using the Intel Core i7
3770k which is of course a third
generation IV Ridge processor and I'm
running it at the somewhat inadvisable
frequency of 4.6 gigahertz and a 1.36
volts now I did this not because I
needed that much voltage at that
frequency but I really wanted to give
these high-end coolers a really heavy
load to deal with I'm going to be
changing this in the future because at
that
voltage I was running very at very high
temperatures particularly when the
temperature here rose up in the summer
months so I am going to be lowering that
frequency maybe just a tad and
definitely lowering the the voltage
quite a bit because that is hitting
right up against that area where Ivy
Bridge processors tend to to kind of go
over the edge and get really really hot
really really quick but all the coolers
were able to handle it I'm happy to say
beyond that I'm also using an Asus
saber-tooth z77 motherboard and I also
did use the Asus AI suite software which
has the Thermal radar function I was
using that to monitor the temperatures
not just to the CPU but also the V RMS
because they were heating up a lot as
well as well as the other connection
points on the board
I was also using that to adjust the fan
speeds to go 60% as well as 100% fan
speed for the various tests I was
running I got also got 16 gigs of
Corsair ddr3 1600 memory 4 by 4 gig kits
I do have a video card in there although
it was did not have a load on it but
that's the Asus GTX 580 directs you to
also for the power I have a PC power and
cooling 750 watt power supply man for
storage main operating system drive
Kingston HyperX SSD and I was running
Windows 7 64 bits and for my testing
software or the load software is using
prime95 running the small FFT load test
or stress test on that next up let's
talk about methodology and this is one
place where I learned a lot when it
comes to methodology for CPU cooler
testing I think the most important thing
is to maintain consistency there's lots
of different variables that you might
roll in there that might change the
outcome of your tests one or another but
as long as everything is tested the same
we should get at least using these
parameters we should be able to get an
apples to apples comparison of all these
coolers so that said I was using cooler
masters ice fusion thermal interface
material right here I chose this not
because it's an extremely high-end
thermal interface material but because I
have this tub of it and there's a lot
and I need to do lots of replications
it's also fairly easy to apply if you're
interested where this falls in the
spectrum of thermal interface materials
it's right in the middle
it's not super high-end but it's
definitely not terrible or anything
either I actually came up with a new
method using since this is fairly
liquidy using a chopstick did have been
in and put a perfect circle dead center
on the CPU which worked quite well in
between tests I was cleaning everything
off using art to clean thermal material
remover and surface purify which is
fantastic for cleaning thermal grease
off does an excellent job make sure
everything's nice and clean as I swapped
between CPU coolers the testing itself
first
after the cooler was initially installed
I did a 1-hour prime95 small FFT burnin
that was just to liquify the thermal
interface material make sure it seeped
into all the nooks and crannies on the
CPU heat spreader as well as on the
block from the pump or from the closed
loop cooler to make sure that it was
getting a nice good contact after the
one hour burnin I let it rest with the
system off for a half an hour and then
after that I did a 15 minutes with the
CPP with a computer booted up take the
idle temperature for temperature
measurements I'm actually doing the core
temperature using the average of all
four cores after that I would do another
15 minutes idle after that I would do 15
minutes of prime95 small FFT with the
fans at 60% to get the 60% temperatures
another 30 minute rest that I'll to let
the temperature drop back down then
another 15 minutes of prime95 with the
fans at 100% to get the 100 100% fan
speed temperatures at full load and now
I guess it's about time to finally show
you guys the results so again these
results are all normalized to 22 degrees
Celsius and again I can say that all of
these coolers performed very well given
the amount of load on the CPU and the
temperature that I was creating all
these coolers were able to handle
despite it being summer here and the
temperatures being in the 80s and 90s
they they all did a great job if you're
looking at this chart here and you want
to pick a winner that's the h2 20
definitely the h2 20 was the winner
although all of these CPUs coolers
performed within about 3 or 4 degrees
Celsius of each other so they were all
within just just with
shouting distance of each other I think
when it comes to the actual results but
I will say that any off-the-shelf cooler
that can handle
prime95 small FFT load on a 3770k at 4.6
gigahertz and 1.36 volts is doing a fine
job particularly in the middle of summer
but again the H 220 as the winner for
this particular roundup when it comes to
actual temperatures although you will
see that all the coolers are doing a
fine job keeping that CPU cooled down
and then again if you want to take the
acoustics into account the H 220 I'm
sorry the the H 110 from Corsair was the
quietest thanks to the I think the
larger 140 millimeter fans followed by H
220 and then last would be the the 240 L
and the thermal take water 2.0 again but
again these are sound comparisons that
are subjective based on what I heard and
it's also just between these coolers and
I've definitely heard louder coolers
than any of these when it comes to fan
noise as well as pub noise and that I
wraps it up let's do some closing
remarks again this has been a learning
experience for me I'm going to be
modifying my testing methodology for CPU
coolers in general in the future gonna
stick with the closed system I think I'm
going to lower my CPU frequencies and
voltage down just just a tad especially
if I want to be testing 120 millimeter
140 millimeter coolers as well to get
them into this ballpark because I am
pretty sure that a smaller cooler like
120 millimeter one I just wouldn't even
have been able to handle the load I put
onto it so if I did have any of those in
this roundup I wouldn't even have been
able to run the tests I'm also going to
be looking at doing some audio quality
or some some noise generation
comparisons as well I'll be looking into
getting a perhaps a microphone or
something that can actually shine
pressure a bit more specifically if not
I will just use my microphone to record
and give you guys just an actual
playback comparison of the different
noises that are the amount of noise
that's being generated depending on of
course the load as well as the fan speed
that I'm running but I do want to close
by saying a huge thank you to
Thermaltake Coolermaster Swift tech as
well as Corsair for allowing me to take
a gander at all their coolers again any
one of these is going to be a great
choice for you guys if you're looking at
it
the Swift tech age 220 if I can do one
one final thing that you might take into
consideration these are really hard to
find right now they seem to be in short
supply so if you find an age to 20 go
for it if not again
any one of these other ones will do a
fantastic job for you that's going to
wrap it up for this video once again
thanks to you guys who've been waiting
on this one I know I've gotten a lot of
comments from people saying where is the
CPU cooler comparison I know it's been a
long time coming but I'm I'm moving very
soon I will be setting up a new area
we're getting some new equipments I'll
be having some dedicated space to do my
video so that I'll be able to crank them
up a bit more frequently as well as
bring you guys some more testing
comparison videos to give you guys some
bet some more knowledge and some more
stuff to go off of when you're looking
at purchasing especially something like
this when you're talking look spending
$100 more on just a CPU cooler it's good
to have some results so you know what
kind of performance you can expect also
coming in very soon I still have a
couple ACS the 87 motherboards so I'm
going to be doing some testing with
those the 87 pro is the 87 sabertooth so
I still got more videos on the way
stay tuned for those please toss me like
if you enjoyed this video go ahead and
post a comment down below if you were
surprised by any of these results or if
you'd like to see additional tests in
the future I'd love to hear your ideas
for that and then of course for these
e87 boards I've already got a lot of
excellent comments and feedback on the
unboxings I did for those but I'd love
to hear additional stuff because those
videos are still to come thanks again
everyone for watching this video guys
and I will see you next time on Paul's
