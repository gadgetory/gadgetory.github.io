core p9 DTG click the sponsor link in
the description well guys Rison - has
launched this is my initial benchmarking
video for it so thank you so much for
stopping by to check this video out and
of course if you enjoy it don't forget
to hit the thumbs up button on your way
up before you leave today there are four
new CPUs available for purchase you can
see them all here you've got the eight
core 60 and thread 2,700 X and 2,700 as
well as the six core 12 thread twenty
six hundred and twenty six hundred
for overclocking just like first gen
Rison and they all come with CPU coolers
the Wraiths aspire for most of them or
the new wraith prism with RGB lights and
actual heat pipes on it if you're going
to shell out three hundred and thirty
dollars for the 2700 X these are all
also based on these n+ architecture
which is a refinement of the original
Zen architecture from last year it's
manufactured on the Global Foundries 12
nanometer process the result is CPUs
that can run at higher frequencies about
250 megahertz faster across the board
with reduced cache Layton sees while
still remaining backwards compatible
with existing socket am 4 motherboards
although older 300 series motherboards
might need a UEFI update before they
accept new 2000 series CPUs so make sure
that whatever board you choose if you're
getting a 300 series says AMD rise in
desktop 2000 ready on it and that should
at least provide you boot support with
these new 2000 series processors so you
can get the board up and running and
then run the BIOS update or if you're
setting up a new system and buying parts
400 series boards with the x4 70 chips
that are now available x4 70 boards will
have the best high-end overclocking for
ships like the 2600 X and 2700 X and
they'll also let you use store mi which
is AMD's new SSD caching solution it's
actually pretty flexible since you can
set it up and remove it after you've
installed Windows and it integrates a
ddr4 caching layer as well but I'm gonna
have to cover that in more detail in a
separate video for now though let's take
a look at my testing setup I'm going to
be comparing the 2700 X and 2600 X to
the 1st gen rise in 1600 X and 8
and I'll also include Intel's six core
12 through at 8700 K to see how a team
blues top mainstream chip stacks up all
the CPUs are running at stock
frequencies with turbo boost or
precision boost enabled I set up the
testbed on the new Asus crosshair seven
hero this is the successor to the
crosshair six hero that I used which is
the X 370 motherboard this has the X 470
chipset and I've updated it with the
latest bios version provided by Asus
which is version zero five zero eight
which was launched on April 13th for the
memory I have enabled XMP mode with Asus
they call it do CP but I enabled the XMP
profile for ddr4 at 3200 cats latency
1414 14:34 at one point three five volts
I also wanted to turn off anything that
might be extra there and the BIOS
settings to make sure that I was just
getting the stock performance like most
people could expect with the 2700 X to
2600 X out of the box with any
motherboard so performance enhancer is
set to default performance bias is set
to none and core performance boost is
enabled to make sure that we can get
that precision Boost 2.0 the memory kid
has a G scale tried NCR gb ddr4 kit it's
a 2 by 8 gig kits ddr4 3200 cast latency
14 my storage drive is a samsung 960 pro
512 gig nvme SSD and the power supplies
in EVGA 750 watt g3 finally for a
graphics card across all the tests we're
using an Asus GTX 1080 TI Strix with
NVIDIA 3:9 1.35 drivers my first test is
a tried-and-true Cinebench benchmark in
multi-threaded performance mode we can
see the 8 cores and 16 threads really
taking off with a total score of 1789
for the 2700 X and 1358 for the 2600 X
here you'll see a trend that continues
throughout my testing which is the 2700
X winning when multi-core is a factor
the 2600 X coming up pretty close in
some situations to the 1800 X but of
course beating out the 1600 X in all
scenarios the 2700 X does seem to
consistently beat the 8700 K but more on
that as we move on Cinebench single
thread is an important test because it
shows the single threaded performance
advantage that Intel still has with the
8700 K with the score of 203 the 2,700 X
is increasing it's single sided
performance with a score of 178 as
compared to last generations
one-sixty moving on - cpu mark overall
score here is 17,000 693 for the 2700 X
and just over 15,000 for the 2600 X
that's over a 1000 point jump going from
the 1600 X to the 2600 X so nice to know
that even folks who are being a little
bit more on the budget side with a 230
dollar range CPU are still getting a
nice performance boost CPU mark single
thread shows similar performance
differences to Cinebench single thread
with again the 8700 k coming out on top
with a score of two thousand seven
hundred and seventeen
moving on to blender this is the splash
fishy cat render and here we can see all
the times within the 30-second range the
2,700 X does manage to break into the
sub 30 seconds with a twenty nine point
eight second score faster is better here
of course and we can see the other chips
falling in line as expected compared to
the Cinebench tests here's the BMW 27
render also using blender and again we
can see that the 2700 X with all of its
cores and threads beats out all the
competition with a time of 265 seconds
the 8700 K was previously neck and neck
with the 1800 X with only a six-second
differential but with the updated Zen +
architecture we can see the 2700 X
pulling away moving on to 3d mark
firestrike ultra we have overall
graphics and physics results here bear
in mind the graphics is all testing the
same graphics card but we can see slight
variations depending on the CPU that is
paired up with the physics core is
probably what you want to pay attention
to here and again the 2700 X wins with
the score of 20 1140 here's 3d mark time
spice similar to fire strike ultra but
we're talking DirectX 12 now instead of
DirectX 11 again we have overall
graphics and CPU scores and once again
we can see the 2700 X just dominating
the CPU score with 8901 moving on to
some game testing here is rise of the
Tomb Raider DirectX 12 mode we're
testing geothermal valley and we're
doing all these tests at 1920 by 1080
because that will show more difference
in performance when it comes to the CPU
as opposed to just testing what the
graphics card can do of course some
games are tuned differently than others
but with rise of the Tomb Raider we can
see a variance here the 8,700 case
should give us the best performance out
of the 10 atti if cpu is a factor at all
and here we can see that play out with
the average frame rate of 150 9.5
seconds whereas our rise in CPUs are
coming in a good 20 to 30 FPS below that
now in this test it was the most
exaggerated but as we move on we can see
that that is not always the case
total war Warhammer 2 for example shows
pretty much zero variation between any
of the CPUs I tested this means that we
are GPU limited rather than CPU limited
the CPU is not holding the graphics card
back at all this is what the graphics
card is capable of putting out at 1920
by 1080 115 frames per second across the
board moving over to Grand Theft Auto 5
and here again we can see some variation
between the CPUs the best frame rate 164
FPS with 8700 K but we did get
respectable frame rates beyond that in
the 130 and 140 frames per second range
with the Rison based CPUs so there's a
drop-off in performance there but this
again is at 1080 if you were to increase
the resolution to 2560 by 1440 or 4k
you'd see those numbers even out so
we're really Rhett testing at the low
resolution just to show the difference
speaking of difference or lack thereof
over watch at 1920 by 1080 is pretty
much hitting the 300 frames per second
cap with a GT X 1080 Ti so all the
results are just shy of that and I
probably didn't even need to run this
test but it's there so there you go play
all the overwrought you want with the
1080 Ti and finally player unknowns
battlegrounds which is known to suffer
some from some optimization issues so
here again we can see some difference in
frame rates with the 8700 K coming out
on top without n54 frames per second but
the 2700 X and 2600 Edge x definitely
catching up compared to last generation
with scores of 140 to 124 frames per
second respectively next to some power
draw comparisons I'm testing the total
system power draw as measured from the
wall so not just the CPU but also the
graphics card and everything included as
well I'm testing average and peak power
draw while winning the 3d mark
firestrike ultra combined test and then
of course idle once the system has been
sitting still for about a half an hour
with nothing going on to make sure it's
completely idle it does seem like the
idle numbers have improved a little bit
so only 61 50 59 watts of power drawn
win a title so it's a little bit better
that we saw with the X 370 motherboard
so maybe some power efficient
see improvements with x4 70 that's just
speculation I don't actually know what
causes that difference but when it comes
to average power drought we're seeing a
bit of an increase but not significant
the 2700 X did draw the most power 385
watts on average with a peak at 414 and
just about a 10 watt drop off for the
2600 X and all of this is still within
the same general range as the 1800 X and
1600 X 8700 K has the lowest listed
average power draw it here but bear in
mind that is a 6 core processor and it
is at least in the case of the 1800 X
and 2700 X being compared to 8 core
processors as well on the temperatures
though and I did decide to use the
Wraiths prism cooler for both of the
CPUs the 2700 X and 2600 X so bear that
in mind when I'm comparing these
temperatures Zen plus is actually more
efficient than the original Zen for
example AMD tested at 3.5 gigahertz
fixed frequency and found it drew 11%
less power but since they also increased
the clock speeds the TDP actually went
up from 95 watts on the 1800 X to 105
watts for the 2700 X and my Ida 64
stress test after a 15-minute run both
CPUs were topping out just shy of 90
degrees Celsius voltages were peaking at
about 1.4 to 1.5 volts even but those
were just peak numbers as it was running
it was actually about 1.3 volts on
average I also want to point out that
when you're looking at the i-264
temperature check here you can see
little Peaks so the temperature rises
gets up near 90 degrees and then the CPU
frequency throttles back just a little
bit in order to account for that higher
temperature temperature drops back down
towards 80 and the cycle continues the
upshot and what we're looking at here
with the 2700 X is a frequency of about
4 gigahertz across all cores when it's
under a stress test load like this but
we see that drop off to about 3.9 five
or even 3.9 gigahertz as temperatures
ramp up thanks to the way precision
boosts 2 works however it's able to ramp
down that clock speed more slowly and
that maintains a higher frequency for a
little bit more of the time so you're
not going to see as much performance
drop off as you might have with
precision boost 1.0 here in my screen
cap you can also see the new rise in
master 1.3 software it has been updated
with some new features like showing the
motherboard socket power and sustained
vrm capacity as well as a little gold
star on your fastest core it also gives
you a little
over star on your second-fastest core
and then a couple silver circles
indicating the course on your fastest
CCX unit on the CPU the chips are been
at the factory according to AMD and
these values as far as what the fastest
core is are actually hard-coded and for
each processor and I'm not covering
overclocking today but I did at least
want to mention it since all these CPUs
are unlocked for overclocking similar to
last generation you could save $30 and
go with the non X CPU like a 2600 $499
versus the 2600 X for 230 dollars
overclock it and get yourself pretty
close to that 2600 X performance that
said I only did some brief overclocking
with the CPUs and there doesn't seem to
be a ton of overclocking Headroom it is
there but it's pretty minimal again
similar to the first-generation Rison
you should expect 4 gigahertz across all
cores whether you're talking about the 6
core or the 8 core it seems to be
achievable without overclocking although
it will ramp off the speed a little bit
depending on the temperatures in the
cooling solution that you're using 4.1
or 4.2 gigahertz on all cores seems to
be a fairly reasonable expectation if
you're manually overclocking depending
on your processor and your motherboard
of course and potentially 4.3 gigahertz
or even 4.4 gigahertz on all cores might
happen but that's going to be more
challenging more of a stretch goal
you're gonna have to play the silicon
lottery a little bit and you're probably
gonna need to go with high-end air or
liquid cooling in order to maintain
those higher frequencies so guys that
pretty much covers it for my
introductory benchmarks for risin 2 CPUs
the 2700 X and 2600 X both tested today
and I'm pretty impressed obviously this
isn't like a massive sea change in
performance
they weren't promising this is a brand
new architecture or anything like that
but since we also have backwards
compatibility with a m4 motherboards and
existing be 350 and X 370 chipsets it's
not too bad it means you could take for
example like in my video I did on my
$500 build earlier this year a system
that you built for a relatively little
money and upgrade it from like a
quad-core with no simultaneous
multi-threading to an 8 core 16 thread
CPU I mean it's a pretty massive shift
in performance and it's really cool that
you can get such a wide range of
processors on a single platform I don't
even mind the fact that they have new
motherboards that are x4 70 there's a
few extra features that you get there
but
nothing that would make be 350 or X 370
motherboard users feel like wow I really
need to upgrade for this new stuff
there's a couple new things there and
hopefully check out store mi in the
future but for now I'd like to hear what
you guys think about this new product
launch so let me know down in the
video's description what you think of
the new processors if you think the
performance is up to snuff and if you're
considering a build based on the new
platform or the 2700 X through 2,700
2,600 X or 2,600 even and of course
don't forget that the thumbs up button
on your way out if you enjoyed this
video thank you guys so much for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
