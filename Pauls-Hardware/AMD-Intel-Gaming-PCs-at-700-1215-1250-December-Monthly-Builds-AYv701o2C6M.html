more information what's up guys how's it
going and welcome to my monthly builds
video for December 2017 every month I
come out with a couple parts lists that
I share with you guys give you my
suggestions for what I think are good
choices when it comes to building a PC
if you're choosing your own parts and
that is what the series is all about I
typically build one of the systems every
month as well so check out my builds
playlist if you want to see me actually
assembling some stuff for today we're
just going to be going over parts lists
and I wanted to point out that we're
actually going to be going over a couple
of last month's part lists I did them at
the towards the end of November and it's
changed it shifted around just a little
bit I also want to point out that I
usually have a strawpoll for you guys to
get feedback in and I'm not doing that
this month simply because next month in
January there's still a lot of stuff up
in the air that I'm not really sure
about so I'm gonna delay things will do
reset when we come back to that but fear
not your feedback will again be part of
my multi build series when that's when
that happens now last month I had two
builds a 650 dollar and a $1,150 builds
and they were both AMD based and they
both had like swappable parts so you
could take some of the more expensive
parts from their more expensive build
and some of the less expensive parts and
less expensive build swap around to kind
of find yourself a mid-range now because
my recommendations this month haven't
changed that much since last month but
some prices have I'm gonna re I'm gonna
go over those two builds one more time
we'll take a look at what has happened
to pricing since then and also maybe
some suggestions for those of you who
are maybe a little disillusioned with
the with the PC filling a PC and how
much money it's costing right now so
here is my six hundred and fifty dollar
build which is now crept up to seven
hundred ish dollars and that's due to
some of these products that were on sale
for the Black Friday and Cyber Monday
timeframe not being on sale anymore so
the risin 312 hundred for example was
less than a hundred dollars in fact you
were able to get the 1300 X 499 dollars
a week or so ago that's
backed up to 109 the be 350 motherboard
that I had chosen for around 80 bucks is
now up to 102 you can still find very
viable be 350 motherboards for around
$80 so I would definitely check that out
rather than going with this in fact
let's see if I can swap that out real
quick look real quick and see what's
going on here with the be 350
motherboard landscape oh no there's a
three 20s in there we have to filter
those out so here's you be 350 boards
starting at around 60 bucks going up
Tyrande 8090 creeping up into the
hundred dollar range just a little bit
here I would personally recommend
checking out the asrock order to go with
a be 350 a be 350 M pro 4 or the be 350
M Pro from asrock are both pretty solid
boards when it comes to overclocking as
well as not being crazy over crazy
expensive again rising three prices have
just crept back up a little bit again
I'd like to see these back under $100
but keep your eye out for deals on those
there's that gigabyte motherboard it was
a solid deal for the discount that it
was that it had still a good board but
it's just a little bit more money now so
if you're on a strict budget you might
not be able to afford that this course
my memory kit is one that I've
recommended a lot simply due to its easy
compatibility with Rison systems and
definitely double check your memory and
your motherboards memory compatibility
list before you choose your memory I
have been recommending memory that's
3,000 or 3,200 rated for Rison because
you do get some added performance out of
that but you want to make sure it's
compatible this kit definitely is but
when we get to the next build the kit
that it actually updated that one with
isn't so more on that in just a second
after storage if you've been watching
these videos I typically recommend a 250
gig SSD to get yourself started to get
your operating system loaded on and then
find yourself a inexpensive or a
hand-me-down used hard drive pull one
from an old system to add some more
storage and thankfully this price has
come down a bit you can get a 256 gig
SanDisk or a 240 gig a data for about
$70 that's about 10 or 15 dollars
cheaper than we were seeing a week or
two ago so that's not too bad at all
barring of course some individual sales
it might have sold out quickly so maybe
we're seeing the end prices come down
just a little bit who knows for a video
card I still feel like the aim
cards are just a tad overpriced so if
you're in the $200 to $250 range the gtx
960 is a good choice in there but bear
in mind that the three gig you can get
for about fifty bucks cheaper for about
two hundred the six gig the cheapest you
can get is around two hundred and sixty
dollars definitely worth it for the six
gig if you're considering anything
beyond 1920 by 1080 gameplay if you're
thinking about 1440 or that kind of
thing but for 1080 either of those cards
will work just fine for a case we have
about a $45 ish case and the master box
five is a good option for that it's all
a case still fairly inexpensive that's
after a $10 rebate of course and there's
other cases in the $55 range that you
could argue about that might be better
but pick whichever one you think looks
best because aesthetics that's kind of
where you can choose your aesthetics is
when you're picking out your case for a
power supply we have an 80 plus bronze
rated unit from corsair it's only about
fifty dollars looks like it's out of
stock at Amazon but you can get it at nu
a grant now and it shows this one simply
because it's 550 watt which should cover
the jobs that the vast majority of
computers need right now when it comes
to the amount of power that's required
and then it's also got it's not modular
but it does have all black cabling
that's attached so you're not gonna have
any ugly looking ketchup and mustard
cables that's all for that initial build
again it was about $650 last month a
little bit more expensive this month but
there are still some deals going on
since the beginning of December and you
know people are still buying stuff for
that of the holidays and Christmas so
keep your eye out for deals I guess what
I'm saying and lament the fact that you
didn't purchase stuff last week if the
thing that you wanted that was on sale
is no longer on sale next up again a
rehash of November's is the $1,150 build
and that has crept up to 1215 dollars so
about 65 ish dollars more some of these
are still the same price so the surprise
five sixteen hundred one hundred and
ninety dollars well it did dip down a
little bit below that in the past week
or two but that's still very good price
for your six core 12 red rise in five
this asrock actually 70 board still the
same price so that's still pretty good
deal for it X 370 at 130 bucks here's
the parametric filter I used for the
Corsair memory so let's jump over to
that first off look there's your 1600
only 190 dollars maybe that'll be go to
micro Center if if you really want to
deal on a CPU they have a CPU and
motherboard combos you can get usually
20 or 30 bucks off with there's that
asrock motherboard look it's got a $20
million rebate if you get it at new way
and here's my parametric filter which is
one of the features from PC part faker
perk picker which is where I just told
it hey I want Corsair memory I want it
to be either 3000 or 3200 speed and I
want a 16 gig kit to buy eight gigs if
you filter those down you might get the
Corsair Vengeance lpx kits or you might
get those for instance the Vengeance led
kit this kid is not at least in my
experience you might want to double
check again your motherboard
compatibility this this is not as
compatible with Rison as the other stuff
the standard Vengeance lpx kits so do
double check that and make sure if
you're using the parametric filter or if
you're gone by my lists always do a
little bit of reality checking to make
sure that your memory is gonna be
compatible moving right along we have
storage again I was looking at storage
based on price per gigabytes as well as
seeing what you could get if you're
spending a little bit more now that 250
gig one was about $70 you got to pay
about 50 bucks more to get yourself into
that double that that storage range 480
to 500 gigs but 430 dollars at a price
per gig of 27 cents the SSD plus 480 gig
is a pretty good deal right now but
again you know if you're on the budget
you might not be able to afford that but
if you're spending a little bit more on
your system and then definitely keep
that in mind but a little bit better
price per gigabyte on the 500 gig
versions for video card for this
particular build of just just in a gtx
1070 and i've chosen to get the cheapest
one possible and unfortunately they're
420 dollars which might make you
reconsider like if you're looking at a
10 78 for $420 definitely might be worth
it to pay 30 bucks more for a $450 gtx
1070 TI which is closer in performance
to a gtx 980 then at 1070 so yeah the
1070 deals might not be your best bang
for the buck right now umm but still I
guess maybe check a bag at 56 as well
you can see if they get 56 for 400 bucks
and then go for that rounding out this
builds the case I had chosen with the
was the Eclipse P 400 but $80 was the
price budget for the case
then finally the power supply which was
about $65 and that is an 80 plus gold
unit since this is a little bit more
expensive of a system and again the
price for this entire system coming in
at 1215 dollars at least right now
according to PC part picker so you do
have compatibility there but again if
you're looking for example at the more
budget build the 700 issue dollar builds
and you're like oh I want that but I
want I want the risin 5 1600 instead of
the risin 3 1200 then you can pay an
extra $80 and get that and swap it in
part of the reason why I've recommended
am four and why I've been recommending
AMD builds right now is simply because
they have an upgrade path they have an
upgrade path going into next year AMD as
promised and four is gonna stick around
we're probably gonna season 2 CPUs
launched on the same platform I can't
promise you that but everything we've
been told seems to indicate that and
when you're comparing right now the
actual raw CPUs performance that you get
with rise ins 6 core and 8 core
processors compared to what you get on
the mainstream Intel side that's just
kind of no contest when it comes to bang
for your buck ok I've got one more build
for you guys and this one is definitely
a gaming focused build if you are gonna
do other stuff besides gaming which
includes maybe video editing or if
you're gonna do three at a 3d animation
or if you're gonna be gaming and
streaming at the same time this might
not be the most viable build I would
recommend to go into that rise in 1600
build that we just covered moments ago
but this is actually a Intel 7700 K
based system and that is solely due to
the fact that 7700 K can be had for a
pretty decent discount if you compare it
to what it was selling for before this
most recent launch of the coffee like
stuff so combine that with some
reasonably priced z2 70 boards and you
can't get yourself a pretty powerful
gaming system you're gonna have a quad
core 8 thread CPU and then the graphics
card I've chosen for this is a gtx 1070
TI of course you could swap that for a
1070 or a 1080 if you wanted to spend a
little bit less or a little bit more
money and then also gets a little bit
less or a little bit more GPU
performance but overall cost of this is
around 1200 and
50 dollars so it's a little bit more
expensive than that our five sixteen
hundred build that we just came across
but it does feature the i7 seventy seven
hundred K which is really good
overclocker and an excellent excellent
gaming processor so if you're going to
pair this with a high-end graphics card
in most situations you're going to be
getting the most you can out of that
high-end graphics card and it's good to
see that whereas the typical price of
this is somewhere in the 340 to $350
range now you can get it for around two
hundred and ninety dollars right now
again less of a bargain when you compare
it to some of the AMD stuff that's out
there but for Intel hardcore Intel users
or people who again are just purely
focused on gaming it's still good option
the cry ring h7 is a very good CPU
cooler it's pretty simple to install
does a very good job and looks nice to
boot so less than $30 at nigga please
right now ESU's prime z - 70 - a
motherboard really solid motherboard
just just look at them readings
available for less than one hundred and
fifty dollars right now you can even get
a couple mil and rebates for it and it's
got support for like all the good things
including a couple MDOT two slots on
there as well as one-time dot two slot
that is also compatible with SATA and
about two devices more on that in just a
second and with the two by eight gig of
memory kit for this it's a little bit
lower slower speed memory because that's
not going to impact your performance on
an Intel platform as much as it will on
the AMD platform at least with Rison and
memory prices are probably the main
thing that's keeping these overall
prices of these builds really high right
now so a hundred and forty five dollars
is a good deal right now for a two by
eight gig kit of ddr4 two hundred twenty
four hundred memory that's a team kits
and you know it's a very small picture
there but it's black and silver so it'll
look okay and then we have our storage
of course this is a native premiere SP
550 240 gig it is an MDOT to drive but
it is SATA so we have to make sure that
our MDOT two slot on the motherboard is
compatible estate a lot of them will
have legacy backward compatibility with
SATA as well as compatibility with the
nvme so just double check that the as
are the asus motherboard that we're
using does so for $70 you know you don't
have to worry about plugging in SATA and
power cables from your motherboard just
slot it into your motherboard and you're
good to go
1070 TI's
you can actually get for MSRP right now
at least $450 is what those were told to
be selling for and that's what they
actually sell for so there you go you
can save 30 bucks by getting a regular
1070 or you can spend 50 dollars more
and get a 1080 the NZXT s340 really
solid case for a couple years now and
just won that for $60 it's hard to pass
up when I'm choosing cases I know a lot
of it comes then to aesthetics and what
you like but I tried to choose cases
that I know are reasonably well built
and have good features to make the the
build process fairly simple sv40 is
definitely one of those and for 60 bucks
with the $10 million rebate from Newegg
I think you probably can't go wrong I
chose the all-black version but it comes
in a few different colors as well
finally our power supply again the
course here is cxm semi modular this is
the same well not exactly the same unit
but partially modular all black cables
650 watts and it's 80 plus bronze rated
and it's only $60 on Amazon so there you
go a nice solid power supply for your
power delivery needs and the last thing
I wanted to do really quick was compare
this build at $1,250 - two years ago two
years ago in November 2015 I posted this
video my bang for the buck gaming rig
and $200 mom-and-pop system my November
builds about two years ago and in here
my $1200 bang for the buck gaming PC
featured a I 560 600 K a hyper 212 plus
a gtx 980ti amp from ZOTAC as e170 pro 4
SS roc motherboard eight gigs two by
four gig kit of memory 120 gig SSD and a
cooler master case and a 650 watt power
supply so for about $1,200 a couple
years ago that's what we were looking at
if you're comparing that to like right
now here's here's that actual build and
the price is wrong because a lot of
these things aren't available anymore
but if you're comparing that to right
now it's a good example of why it kind
of feels like the PC market with as
exciting as it's been with all the
product launches this year has overall
remained somewhat stagnant when it comes
to the actual price that you're paying
compared to this system you're comparing
this system to the $1,250 system right
now you're getting a 70
600k instead 7700 k instead of a 6600 k
so we've jumped up to hyper-threading
you're getting roughly the same caliber
of cpu cooler motherboard you're getting
twice as much memory but it's for almost
twice as much money so that's not much
of a difference and you're getting a bit
more capacity on the SSD and you getting
a 10-7 TTI instead of a 980ti for a bit
less money so there are some
advancements that have happened that
have made things a little bit more
affordable here and there but hopefully
you come 2018 we'll see an and prices
start to come down a bit more so we'll
actually get better pricing on both SSDs
as well as memory I think that combined
with the competitive marketplace that
the introduction of Verizon has created
will get us to a point where we're gonna
have some really good budget PC options
next year for now if you're buying in
2017 for the end of the year definitely
keep a close eye out for any of those
last-minute deals because there will be
vendors trying to clear some stuff out
and then of course leave any comments in
the comments section you have down below
if you found good deals or if you have
other suggestions for variations of
parts lists like the ones I've shared
today share those with the people read
in the comments and maybe you'll help
them out a little bit but guys thank you
so much for watching this video if you
enjoyed it the domes up button of course
links to all the products and pretzels
that I've talked about in the video's
