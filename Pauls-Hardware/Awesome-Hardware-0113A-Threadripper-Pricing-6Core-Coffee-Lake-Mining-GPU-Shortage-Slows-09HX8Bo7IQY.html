every word as I dispense the tech as I
usually do knowledge about what's going
on yeah we should be live right about
now so hello everyone and welcome to
awesome hard work I did this is a live
tech show the cowl and I stream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific we
stream it live to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware we also stream each
half to each of our individual channels
and this is the first half of episode
113 so we're stream to my channel pulsar
we're second half will be on Kyle's
channel in about an hour on bit wit and
thanks to all you guys for watching us
live whether you watching us which are
watching YouTube live bear in mind
during this show and not only do we talk
about technology we also drink a beer
too occasionally we do curse or use foul
language so a case in point right there
you have been warned sorry about that if
you're not into that kind of thing but
we like to just you know kind of go with
the flow here speak our minds speaking
of which let's do the regular things
that we always do at the beginning of
every episode which is to talk about our
stores if you'd like to help support our
channels and get yourself some rich
check out our stores pulsar Burnett is
mine I have shirts like these and mugs
plain glasses Lou these polos them polo
polo shirt right thing if you buy stuff
during the show either from my store or
Kyle's store bit wit dot tech slash
store Oh will give you a little shout
out at the end and if you order from
both of our stories you get your stuff
shipped together and you will get a
refund for part of your shipping and if
you order from neither of our stores you
get nothing that's true
we'll just stare at you discipline it's
a great way to get yourself a fat load
of jack squat absolutely nothing but
anyway that's about all we do at the
beginning of the show letting letting
things spin up we're spinning up the
show right now like a hard drive letting
people to I need to not accidentally hit
that keyboard with my hand alright so
anyway let's oh you know what I didn't
do I didn't point up the lower thirds
actually most of them are still here
that's that's good that's good that's
planning ahead
let's go a message from cell oh that
means something's did something go wrong
yes oh no it's audio not coming through
adios lo oh it's super quiet okay
alright thank you we'll address it right
now we're professionals fix the twitch
title
I know dude it's only our 113th episode
we have this awesome break we have it
all down pat in your in your defense
okay yeah all right thank you
second to Huayra streaming at 60fps
because this man how do we turn the
volume up volume changed um I think we
could just use the right do you turn the
knobs the volume goes up yeah it's the
basic thank yourself for the phone call
in case you're wondering that was cell
processing here's our our awesome friend
and moderator and he also tells us when
things are going wrong hopefully that
made things louder we should create a
word to indicate someone who's a friend
oh wow okay - laughs this is clipping
apparently hello now check one two check
one two check check Mike check should be
better is that better it should be good
it should be perfect there should be
zero I saw two people I saw two people
say it's perfect good feels like good
thank you much better thank y'all so
much for your feedback woo all right I'm
glad I clapped what good is rollover
right anyone who weren't bleeding
already all right
still clipping well it's funny cuz
YouTube is like a good 30 seconds to a
minute behind twitch I think so YouTube
is only just now getting their ears
destroyed if only someone from the
future could have worn them in time
thank you twitch search here we go
go to YouTube now it's too late tell
them that they're about to die all right
cool
anyway guys let's move into the actual
show people are saying it's still
clipping it's still clipping still
employer is very noisy it's like
seriously how sensitive these dials are
must have gotten bumped their super
sense I said it's your fault Kylie
you're talking too loud oh all right
I'll just be a quieter person I read you
that I can't turn me off
unfortunately okay look policies I've
seen as drinking call stress read
trolley ale yep right now good stuff
invited by Kyle and then exhale strike a
new New Castle yeah you can't get all of
Yuki to classic all right sweet let's
say people are saying most people aren't
complete sounds better on Twitch then on
YouTube it should be the exact same I
know what YouTube does with audio
processing all right let's get my notes
back on the screen it denotes ah this is
tech of the day after tomorrow but it
actually is it's wait I bet I can change
we're doing everything on the fly for
today's show so that's how we roll
that's how we do there we go
tech the day after tomorrow technology
that's not it
that's not out yet that's the basic idea
here yep all right video cards comm has
an article here about Intel preparing
multiple six core coffee leak CPUs and
these six core CPUs are not just of the
i7 variety but also the i-5 very
interesting so this is actually
originally from canard PC which is a
french language website which I believe
french-canadian video cards has it
written up here in the Old English but
basically there's a man a few months
Intel a few months that's vague but soon
Intel will introduce new six core
processors based on coffee lake
architecture there's going to be
according to this rumor and I 780 700 K
with a 3.7 gigahertz basical base clock
none of the articles list
beuse clocks yet so that's probably
something that if if this is true at all
which we're not sure about because it's
a rumor the Intel probably hasn't hasn't
dispensed with that information yet but
3.7 gigahertz base with hyper-threading
and it's a six core processor so 6 cores
12 threads with a 95 watt TDP which is
significantly less than their current
six core offering with the 7800 X that's
not a direct response to rising I don't
know what is well certainly then
launching it sooner rather than later
would be for sure but yeah that too
then finally doing six core yeah on the
main stream platform and lower TBH p yea
lower GDP well the TDP is technically up
from their main stream because there is
their main stream used to be like 77
watt with those it has well which has
well 77 I don't know I don't I don't
recall all the all TTP's but I know it's
got up a little bit at least when it
comes to the high ends excuse the
high-end unlock unlock so I guess maybe
performance per watt you could say yeah
well especially there's two more cores
in there so I mean that that certainly
also adds to the the heat output alright
there's also an i7 8700 9 K version with
a 3.2 gigahertz base clock but obviously
both of these would have an impact on
people who were considering something
like a 7800 X which is a 140 watt TDP
and that's an X 299 LG at 20 66 CPU and
those motherboards cost a lot more and
everything so possibly something to
consider as well if you were thinking
about something like a 7 800 X mm-hmm
then of course this would compete with
AMD's risin 7 line up but over there at
this level they have 8 core versions so
yeah the the 1800 X and 1700 X or 95
watt TDP parts and they're both 8 core
16 thread doesn't and then they dropped
to 65 watt with the 8 core 16 thread
1700 mm-hmm anyway though there's also a
risin I'm sorry an i5 80 600 K that is
also 6 cores but without hyper threading
as the i5 s usually are so 6 core 6
thread 8600 k 3.6 gigahertz base clock
also a 95 watt
beyond that one but hey cool six core i5
would have never thought we would have
seen the day hmm it'll be interesting
yeah you used to be you had to had to be
on the enthusiast platform to get that
kind of thing there weren't just those
six core CPUs though there's also the
slowest according to the article six
core which is the core i5 8400 that's a
2.8 gigahertz base clock 65 watt TDP and
that would compete with 65 watt rise and
5s the i5 8400 rise and 5 still has that
SMT though they do yeah they do
yeah that is nice so maybe it'll be
interesting to see how that doesn't get
at that level you do get more threads I
mean I would have to imagine if this is
a third eye duration of their 14
nanometer architecture they're staying
on 14 nanometer as far as they know with
coffee lake it's like plus plus right
before the anime or plus plus or
something like but if they can squeeze a
little bit more Multi multi core
multi-threaded performance by going 6
core but they still have that edge when
it comes to like high top-end gaming
gaming performance yeah then you know
they might have an argument but it all
comes down to how it's priced right I
mean that's where Intel's getting
slammed right now when it comes to like
X to 99 and the i9 stuff is just it's so
expensive compared to AMD stuff if Intel
brought in their prices and made them
more competitive then people will
probably not be giving them quite as
hard of a time course there's other
issues with the platform as well right
but let's move on for that also in this
article there's a few a couple other
mentions from that canard PC article
talk of a pure mobile coffee like mobile
6 core CPU that will be about two point
two point oh gigahertz with a 45 watt
TDP and also coffee like you quad-core
with a 28 watt TDP for low-power
notebooks so that's stuff - alright go
mobile
next up a PC perspective article you
know also in the rumor category but kind
of interesting how this information came
out the rumor is that Intel is going to
be launching a quad-core KB Lake our CPU
or
or a few PPAR CPUs for ultra portables
such as the Acer Swift three here which
believe is where this information
actually came from it was a listing for
an unannounced revision of the Easter
switch three notebook that had the CPU
in question listed as the CPU and Nick
I've had a few other updates for this
revision a new Pascal base Nvidia excuse
me MX 150 GPU that's already known
though that was announced just before
Computex but down here the i5 8250 you
processor is kb lake our that has not
been announced by intel the description
here says it's quad core and based on
this the good folks over at pc
perspective went and did a little bit
more research its article is actually by
ken addison so I can't make any Ryan
trout puns
but anyway yeah based on the knowledge
that the description says it's a quad
core they said following Intel's history
with the u series parts the 85 8250 you
would traditionally be a 15 watt
dual-core CPU with hyper-threading
enabled because it's true quad core
parts are usually a higher TDP now the
article we just talked about was coffee
like coming in at different lower power
lower TDP options but this article also
addresses that they said they'd think
it's different so this is kind of weird
overlap again where you have like a new
KB Lake product coming out with coffee
like also potential in the rise in the
next few months you know which also
should theoretically have low power
options that would be competitive with
something like this but yeah they also
went and looked up the processor ski
once they found at the 8250 you and the
Geekbench database and I found other
notebook manufacturers had already
tested this and uploaded results so
they're expecting refreshed versions of
the Dell XTX XPS 13 and the Asus Zenbook
Zeiten Zenbook ux302
and the benchmark results in Geekbench
they pulled up showed a 54% increase in
multi-threaded CPU performance and about
a 7% increase in single-threaded
performance the multi-threaded
performance increase would make sense
since
you're increasing the core count yeah
so it seems to have hyper-threading as
well yeah okay
well that's cool would have been kind of
more ambiguous had they went to true
quad-core and disabled hyper threading
for some reason but that's nice that get
to have your cake and eat it too yeah so
kind of cool I mean obviously this is in
the room of category so there's still
stuff that's not known about that and
it's information that they pulled up
from other databases and early product
listings and stuff so does does the are
just keep you like does the R represent
mobile is that what the R means they
Intel has the different letters that
they put at the end for like different
sets that are meant for like different
use cases so like you know this is for
like ultra portable notebooks so it's
not quite as the the I mean they've
they've had like 15 watt TDP processors
in these types of products in the past
so very low-power you know should have
really long battery life you know good
for web browsing and a small inexpensive
device or something like that yeah but
they're just trying to segment it from
their high-end stuff their more
mainstream yes top part yes are but the
are would indicate like potentially a
new a new stack of products in that
category
venom yeah anyway alright one more
article in this segment this was
actually launched about or this
information became known about four or
five days ago but a MIDI rise and thread
Ripper has now been confirmed even more
so this is confirmation but there is a
rumor that's a that's sort of woven in
here as well this is a PC gamer article
by Gordon young and this is based on
AMD's announcements last week they also
launched a video on it to processors
that they have confirmed the thread
Ripper 1950 X which is a 16 core 32
thread 3.4 gigahertz base clock 4
gigahertz boosts clock $1000 processor
yeah yeah $1000 AMD's giving you 16
cores in 32 threads also 64 PCI Express
gen3 lanes so that's cool too also the
second processor a 12 core 40 at 12
424 thread thread river 1920 X this one
has a 3.5 gigahertz base clock and a 4
gigahertz boost clock so lower core
count means that it can run more of
those cores at a higher frequency so
that's the slightly higher base 800
dollar price tag on this one so yeah
both of them have 64 PCI Express lanes
available 180 watt TDP so these are
going to require a pretty significant
amount of cooling it's not quite as bad
as like the 220 watt TDP stuff like the
nine ninety five ninety that kind of
thing that they had that kind of
required something like an air cooling
an all-in-one liquid cooler or really
high-end air cooler but they also both
have quad-channel ddr4 and they're gonna
of course be supported by X 399 chips
that motherboards with the big old TR
for sockets there will be pre-orders
here's a look at the socket by the way
so money dies so little time we go look
at that thing is a burst I was blown
away by how big it was just seeing it in
person at Computex that's the span of my
hand
no maybe not that big but yeah it's
definitely the biggest socket I've ever
seen in person it is how many pins LGA
4000 94 this is the pink out there so
there's that twice the size of a
mainstream socket yeah yeah and they
have to make it that big because they
are putting like for individual rising
course so yep each with a well each each
with actually half of their cores
enabled so you get four times four
Justine and then it's kind of and it's
the same layout that they're using for
epic and epic will have four rising
chorus with all of the cores enabled
giving 32 core 64 thread processors
alright a couple more details about this
select pre-orders excuse me selects
pre-orders will be starting on July 27th
Alienware is the major manufacturer or
big box see a maker of computers who
will have them also there'll be some
boutique builders who will be providing
pre-orders on July 27th see
few motherboards will be on shelves in
early August and it's going to support
up to one terabyte of memory when 100
and but that's when you use lrdimms or
load reduced dims other than otherwise I
think it's sports half of that if you're
not using our dims Intel's 16 Core i 979
60 X is supposed to be $1700 by
comparison
so 1700 for 16 cores versus a thousand
for 16 cores Intel's 12 core I 979 20x
is supposed to be $1,200 1,200 versus
800 for the 12 core version also at
least according to what AMD is said none
of these neither of these products have
launched yet intel has launched X 299 as
a platform but they're hired core count
12 12 cores and up CPUs aren't out yet
and we still don't know when they're
gonna be out it's not if if AMD launches
these when they say they're they might
have their 12 and 16 core CPI and
desktop CPUs out there before intel does
there's some tests in the article linked
to the description as all the articles
are by the way if you guys want to check
out a little bit more details but Andy's
test with the 12 core thread repair 1920
X it beat the 10 core 7900 X with a
Cinebench r15 score of 2431 to 2167 then
they also ran Cinebench on the 16 core
threader for 1950 excess cord 3062 so
that's cool there's no word yet on other
core cat versions so like 14 core 10
core for example we're not sure if
that's gonna be a thing at all and the
last thing about this is that due to the
immense size and we imagine higher TDP
of the stutter 4 CPUs it is rumored this
is the rumor brick bit of this that they
are going to ship with liquid all in one
cooling solutions hmm so that at it we
don't know if that's going to be
included with the thousand dollar or 800
dollar price tag or what you'll pay a
premium to get yet include or or if
there's going to be a special kit or
something like that right but this is
the art this is the actual video that
AMD posted by the way if you guys
haven't already seen it here for example
is a
screenshot from the sweet clockers
youtube channel showing i believe this
is Noctua showing their cooler that they
designed the one on the left of the tr4
socket so you can see the size of the
contact plate for that compared to a
standard and four socket for risin on
the right side so there's potential
questions when it comes to conflict PCIe
slots it's wider than the heatsink yeah
is it's wider than the actual you think
so
it is massive and I don't know if
there's any if there's any additional
trickery that needs to go on because
instead of dealing with a centralized
you know CPU die like you are in a
traditional CPU you're dealing with CPU
dies that are spread out across the
substrate I wonder if that all like
saint-like like draft up any new thermal
paste application methods you know
imagine any way to apply thermal paste
specifically for thread Ripper if it
actually makes a difference because of
the layout potentially yes because
you're gonna want to have spread like if
it's yeah like usually it's like all
right if you've have enough spread to
cover the die that's it's a middle
you're right now it's like well you've
got four dies that are spread out even
if it spreads from the middle you might
have corners of those edge ones that
aren't don't doesn't have the pieces
spread over it and whatever and
obviously you're going to need to use
more of it as well squad P method maybe
you do for peace yeah 1p overreach over
each die yeah or it just goes back Chris
you're the old paintbrush yeah yeah you
can do that too you know so there's some
there's some CPU thermal pace that used
to ship with like a is like is like I
polish or whatever you know I polish I I
shadow not even I should what is this I
don't know anything you know I've got
the Navon it's got the brushed against
it and that's yeah I think what is long
we're out of our element all right I
know what you mean yeah yeah no I'm
saying max on wax off type of things
yeah I got you
so cool there it is and so endeth tech
of the day after tomorrow hopefully
sooner rather than later
next up it can a we're bringing back say
it ain't so
yes such a popular segment
yep so these are all terrible stories or
things that have gone wrong or things
that didn't turn out how they would
appear I guess you have a big debbie
downer I'm broadening the
stick-in-the-mud I'm broadening the
definition of this segment so I can
bring more - all right so this is what I
popped up on a reddit today you guys may
have seen it there appears to be
people having issues contacting
emergency numbers with their 1+5 phones
this is the original post on reddit this
guy had to dial 911 +5 yesterday because
he saw a building on fire a few blocks
away
and both times the phone rebooted on him
he posted this Facebook video which I
will now play back for you guys make it
bigger he's a Bulls fan apparently he's
a Bulls fan
no not a Bulls fan at the University of
Texas is long ha Longhorns kind of how
much I know about sports okay so he's
dialing 9-1-1 right now it goes to that
it goes to dial the emergency number I
don't have audio on but um
it never actually rings and then if you
watch here in just a moment I saw a
ceiling and it just shows my phone shuts
down and only with emergency maybe
states but apparently only with
emergency numbers but one number that
you really need you need that line to
connect and when you really need to make
a call like the mostly check your phone
off a life-and-death situation I know
there's also there's also like
government requirements that a phone has
to be able to call nine nine one one
might say seems like it should you know
I don't know the details on that
specifically but Gizmodo dig did pick
this up and apparently there's a little
bit more going on in the reddit thread
and some people have done a little bit
more researching don't try this at home
by the way if you have a one plus five
yeah don't go don't just go trying to
call 9-1-1 or your emergency number
you'll find
apparently there's also using the UK who
reported the same thing although they
have a different number it's not nine on
one over there it's some other it's like
911
it was an English accent but yeah they
have the dude's video up there and stuff
oneplus told Gizmodo that they are
working with customers individually to
solve the issue but did not provide any
further details on the bug Gizmodo
conferred three reports of this going on
and 999 apparently we're hearing from
our UK viewers or people who just know
it's also for a for one one is
information here in the u.s. 69 69 69
sounds like yeah ten-four
hashtag 420 and of course pound 422 save
a life
pound it alright um so yeah if you've
got a 1 + 5 I would keep an eye on this
yeah and see what happens cuz like I
said this is from today so um I don't
have any further follow-up information
on what 1 plus s to say about that
there's gotta be more widespread there's
a great like sketch in here somewhere
where like two guys are on their phones
one guys like one guys Galaxy seven note
with the one plus five days I call
nine-one-one hey you're right and you
just told everyone about it it wouldn't
make that please that could be a vine
right yeah yeah okay beautiful no a PC
gamer article
apparently some Amazon purchasers of
rice and CPUs have not received actual
res and CPUs does that look like a box
no just tell from the heat spreader yeah
so at least two users according to this
article have reported receiving an Intel
Celeron processor masquerading as an AMD
risin 7 1700 so obviously you guys watch
our channels and you're smart people and
just looking at the CPU would be like
that's that is an LG a processor that is
obviously not arisin 7 or whatever it's
purporting to be there's supposed to be
a rise in 7 1700
you can kind of see up there at the top
originally reported by resin reddit you
user
shooter nine nine nine and like I said
two confirmed users according to the PC
Gamer article their piece appears to be
some level of sophistication to this as
the screen down rise and logo looks I
mean if that's all you're looking at
looks somewhat legit here's another if
you don't know any better if you're a
novice builder or something like that it
could slip by you and again this is one
of those things that's only been
reported in the past few days and
there's not a whole lot of follow up on
it yet we don't know if this is
something that's any more widespread it
does seem like something a little bit
more sophisticated but who knows
I believe WCC F Tech reported on this as
well the article references they're
actually read both of their articles on
it WCC F Tech said that the two of the
fake chips appearing the what in the
wild and a short span is indicative of a
well organized mass armed a fraud
seeping through the cracks which is he
knows you know maybe it could be it's
very dramatic very serious it is very
dramatic but but yeah what this appears
to be is RMA fraud which means that
someone the the people who are
committing the fraud bought real CPUs
from Amazon took the CPUs to resell a
user whatever took their fake CPUs put
it back in the box return that to Amazon
probably for a refund
Amazon took the return back Amazon's
return people didn't recognize that CPU
wasn't real gave out the refund and then
put that return CPU back into their
inventory and sold it again so again not
sure how this is gonna happen I wonder
is like if I mean now that it's out like
aren't those people kind of busted like
Amazon I feel like could easily track it
back to them and revoke the refund and
just they have their well they you
always use like in burner accounts I
guess that's Ingram you gotta make sure
that it's not can't be traced back yeah
you get get some address that you know
you can go and pick up packages from or
something like that but right I mean
unless they're stupid you never know and
I feel like if you're smart enough to
put together several like that then yeah
you'd probably be somewhat more
intelligent about how you and
I feel bad for anyone trying to install
that fake horizon processor not knowing
any better and just ruining their
motherboard oh yeah it's on if you do
not know what you're doing like you can
royally screw ups well hardware I mean
maybe I mean I guess you're putting it
in a name for Bora Bora
it'd be less of a chance of destroying
something room but you could probably I
mean II could still okay I don't the
lever go down on to it or just wear all
the pins my everyone said building
computers was easy I just have no idea
that I know I grew up some people get
life yes event taste in their mouth for
Aaron I know if you guys remember but
this is back in 2010 and there was a new
egg fake CPU that the new egg was
selling not like intentionally or
anything like that but it was a bit of a
scandal because this is before I got
there right yeah this is what I was
actually in the box they were supposed
to be i-79 $0.20 and what people
actually got was something like this so
some they they sort of did a some kind
of mold and filled it up to get stuff
that looked vaguely like what it was
supposed to was so this was a reseller
on market place so this was actually
product that was sold to Newegg by dnh
this is from the UH NART achill by the
way this isn't my inside information Oh
No why hasn't this plugged in your
battery's very low record just straight
up just lying on the floor like the
plugs not even plugged I was like I know
that power strips on cuz otherwise our
streaming piece we wouldn't be streaming
right now that should help okay thank
God for those little notifications that
tell you that your sister yeah yeah
thanks thanks windows have been
inconvenient alright um anyway yeah so
like 300 of these got sold to Newegg and
they were actually went into inventory
and started being sold to people and
people started getting them the know you
had to go and investigate and figure out
what where it all happened and they all
traces back to the single order and yeah
that was a bit more of a gray market
like counterfeiter who somewhat knows
probably has some ins inside information
about the industry to get that through
and actually sell them or whatever but
yeah the CPU coolers go for a lot of
those are hard to find these guys yeah
the foam agenda it looks so weird yeah
that's funny all right next up there's
the security robot it's called a night
scope k5 and today committed suicide
yeah it doesn't look so great
dope into a fountain oh it is its own
accord yeah the night scope k5 is a
5-foot tall 300-pound security guard
we've we've actually briefly mentioned I
think we've shown this on the show
before they're you know they're in
service and apparently this this DC
office bought one and then it promptly
committed suicide by diving into the
fountain you know you should live
anymore are you sure it didn't work at
Foxconn or something like that
eventually it seems like I wanted to
click this link this mystery the mall
security there's an image of one yeah
this one knocked over a toddler right
what so maybe it was the same one it
felt so bad for that incident couldn't
couldn't handle the guilt yeah Ross
herself and finally just decided to off
himself I'm gonna dive into the fountain
as a random I have nothing to wear more
oh yeah I was supposed to actually I was
supposed that's alright we'll do what
we'll do this one too
alright this one's actually kind of lame
but it's about Windows 10 so that's why
allows the end of the story okay yeah
there wasn't much more about augusti
security robot it just out a minute
suicide so rest in peace rip yeah all
right so when does 10 support could end
early on some some systems depending on
what actual internal hardware that
system uses this is the best picture we
have to show you on this story so if you
guys aren't familiar with some of the
transitions and changes that Microsoft
has made over the past I don't know how
many years 2 3 4 5 years since they've
switched from Windows 8 and 8.1 to
Windows 10 Windows 10 is now a service
knots like an eider ative product that
they come out with new versions of every
year once you have Windows 10 on your
device you should get all the Windows 10
updates you should always be up to date
with the current version of Windows and
everything like that unless whether you
like it or no
unless your device unless your device
reaches its end of its supported
lifetime which has just recently
happened for some devices so there's a
specific reason why this has happened
but the the more the overall idea is a
little bit scarier we have to assume
Microsoft isn't gonna shoot itself in
the foot too much by like end of life in
products based are like devices based on
products that you know our Comment or
whatever like so basically if you have a
system built on Intel's clover trail
atom processors there's a low cost low
power processors they were manufactured
in devices between 2012 and 2015 not too
long ago but you're basically blocked
from installing Windows 10 version 1703
which is the new creators update you're
stuck with the previous version or prior
and since each version of Windows 10
that comes out such as the creators
update windows is only supporting for 18
months it means that your product that
just lost the support with this previous
version is only going to be supported
for about another 18 months a lot of
this ship the systems that are based on
Intel clover trail atom processors
shipped with Windows 8 and 8.1 so the
people who got them and we're using them
got that like Windows 10 is coming like
update to Windows 10 for free all that
whole nonsense and so like oh yeah I'm
just gonna update to Windows 10 and now
I have it and now my sitting device is
all set but if you happens to be the
owner unfortunate owner of one of these
devices and you update it from Windows 8
or 8.1 what does a main point one have
the what's known as the five plus five
supports policy from Microsoft which is
five years of support for services and
and five additional years of support for
security so that means that you've gone
from potentially having your vice your
device supported by Microsoft until 2023
to having support drop-off 18 months
from now which is a lot a lot earlier
than that early early 2018 is when your
your device support would drop off as
well now to be clear again there is a
specific reason
why support is going away for these CPUs
in particular it's because these used an
on Intel GPU that was designed by
imagination technologies which means
that it's just sort of a throws a wrench
in the driver support so Microsoft for
their side is saying like you know the
resources that would be required to
providing continuous updates for this
particular subset of hardware isn't
worth it or whatever like that so yeah
there's also potentially going to be
updates from some devices based on this
they specifically referenced Acer and
the article they have a note with their
their units that are supported by this
with the different atom processors and
they said that they're going to
potentially provide compatible drivers
to up to address this incompatibility
but them that was like seven months ago
so who knows if that's actually gonna
happen so just something to keep in mind
is that your Windows 10 might not last
forever if Microsoft decides to stop
supporting your hardware are most of
these processors found in laptops yes
these are Adam processes so little pro
like laptops and netbooks that kind of
thing
tablets perhaps okay yeah so if you're
worried that like oh I have like a Sandy
Bridge processor or like something like
that is is Microsoft gonna suddenly
decide Sandy Bridge it's no longer
supported or something like that
potentially years down the road but
they're not going to take something that
has a massive install base and suddenly
say that they're not supporting it again
like this this is almost absolutely for
sure because of the graphics I GPU the
yeah the integrated graphics as part of
this SOC so as a result this set of
products is losing support saying it
really sucks if you use those products
and it really sucks if you look at it
started from a larger perspective as far
as Microsoft support for devices going
on down the road
I wouldn't say run for the hills and
like Microsoft is gonna start you know
dropping a lot of stuff but it's
definitely something to consider if
you're looking into buying a laptop from
here on out like if the integrated
graphics is not
we're considering anything that's like
non-mainstream if it's like oh here's
this like it's it's got a I don't know I
don't I've got all my good examples
would be on the cellphone side because
that's where you find a lot of like you
know chip manufacturers even nerd never
heard of before mm-hmm at least on the
just unlike third-party integration that
seems low
yeah far move from yeah because cuz
Microsoft I mean they they have to do
the development work and and help
support that as they do updates if they
decide to change something for how the
UI UI works did I say Microsoft
yeah they decide to change something
with how the UI works they need to make
sure that that is going to function
across any hardware that it might be
installed on right so by end-of-life
being certain hardware it means they
don't have to worry about that anymore
so saves in man-hours when it comes to
development so yeah
from my understanding it makes sense ok
let's move in to swordfight
so we're great we have one single
swordfight question to answer today it's
kind of based on that robot article mmm
what's a robot that committed suicide
swordfight if you guys are familiar with
it it's suicide worth it I wasn't going
quite that dark that's that's the next
video then from our friend Austin Evans
yeah Oh suicide suicide is it worth it
it's like man let's you can see once
you've reached the height of YouTube
fame then you realize I think it's all
just empty super dirty kind of cool okay
so the question we're gonna answer right
now is should because that that's like a
robot that's kind of doing work and
stuff right and I've always imagined
like in the Jetsons that people will
have assistant robots but maybe people
shouldn't have assistant robots robots
that just help us do things right
they're getting fancier and fancier so
in a generic sort of way but obviously
also finally and forevermore we're going
to decide should people have personal
assistant robots I know you this is
something you've given a lot of thought
to in the past everyday options yes
every day we deserve we deserve to have
robot assistants or that no people are
lazy enough already and of course
they'll end up turning us anyway I'm
gonna go with my gut instinct here
instead of playing devil's advocate and
say no people are already lazy enough
plus the robots will inevitably destroy
us all and you know our digital
overlords will one day I mean we've all
seen terminator well you know how Skynet
works we know that it is not just a
movie but a premonition a warning to all
of us but we have to be on our guard
humans must maintain our the status quo
and we cannot be overtaken by stupid
robots plus we're lazy back back to that
I mean we already have weird things like
the Amazon Alexa thing which I still
think is just kind of weird like like
all of a sudden you have this new family
member that you bought on Amazon it just
I know I might be I might be sounding
like an old person right now too like
the earlier or the the newer generation
stuff like that but um I don't know call
me old-fashioned but I think that you're
old-fashioned I've I've seen the movie
wall-e I know how that goes yeah well
human race when they get super lazy
they're just floating around on these
floating tubes which look really fun I
will admit to start
they looked Opie and incredibly fun but
to actually live on them I feel like
there is a point where you have to kind
of think to use technology responsibly
I feel like technology is like a gun you
know so many people are against guns and
gun violence and gun control it's like
yeah and then it's like you go back to
that argument guns don't kill people you
know people kill people with guns I mean
it's like technology like technology can
be used for good or evil and everywhere
in between I personally think that
having robotic assistance is for
something like disabled people you know
maybe some War veterans or who need the
extra help who live alone something like
that great but if you're like a fully
functional human being like no it's like
it's like having a really badass PC and
like building another PC to help that
already fast PC run faster
if that if that was the thing well it
seems gratuitous seems gratuitous and
very American alright well that's an
interesting that you should phrase it
that way but let me explain why you're
wrong okay alright
always have been so all right here first
off when it comes to personal robot
assistants I'm in favor of them I'm in
favor of robots in general the way I
look at it is like automation right
that's what's coming Automation and
robots will be part of that automation
and robots are going to be handing a lot
of handling a lot of jobs that people
did before so do bad people going to
lose their jobs so people are going to
have work to do anymore which means that
people are going to need robot
assistance in order to help them occupy
their time as well as to help do things
that might otherwise cost some money so
that they can save money because they
don't have jobs anymore this all makes
perfect sense the other thing is that
obviously as indicated in the question
eventually these robots will evolve take
over and you know predator will become
prey all that kind of thing in my
personal opinion the safest way to go
about making that transition which is
inevitable and obviously we can't do
anything about is to make sure that
there's no time in the past that you can
look back on that the robots when they
have their machines working on looking
at the history of everything that's been
uploaded to the internet that you've
never said anything negative about
robots which is why I like robots
they're good and everyone should have a
robot friend you're full of let's
see what people think
the bots are smart enough to figure out
your they'll see right now you
look at that really this is
neck-and-neck slight market in five
votes Wow
this is we should just sit and watch
this the rest of the field we should
just watch this is revenue worth we're
30 half cent were tied oh boy no time I
have three more votes than you no more
votes come on no come on yes come on
see I will always be like one or two
votes ahead oh let's just look at that
one I didn't blow way far ahead and vote
yet no still you we don't get to vote we
get to argue the voting it the argued
that argument well the the straw poll is
linked to the video's description if
anyone else watching in this in the
future and wants to vote on that it will
thought nothing and but it makes filled
the empty void of your existence for
just a free brief bleeding seconds or at
least your existence oh yeah my it'll
make me feel good okay ah see it's 100
watts can't do for you that's right no
they can there's gonna be a hand job a
robot job robot for that too I mean
hopefully we'll have robots that can do
lots of different things but the one
that just complements you all the time
oh no it's using the blender arm
that's why if you're smart you're going
into suffer development every robot
needs a safe word I'm not smart alright
let's finish off my half of the show
with just a quick quick little finisher
finisher which is news of course tech
news I've already discussed quite a bit
of tech news but we're going to talk
about it cerium aetherium yes so fear
you'll read my story go an ethereal
currency it's gone give me just a second
figure YUM what a cool sounding name
this just sounds cool just the sound of
it when you hear it makes you want to
mine it okay quit Cal aren't you talking
about this on your half - a little bit a
little bit on the theory I'm alright
so the thinking price has gone way down
but not entirely so I'm gonna
now yeah use GPUs though are also
becoming a little bit more available
which is pretty cool this article on
hardware discusses several of those
things and but let's just go directly to
ebay shall we do it
look at this look at this large 470 stop
it stopped at eBay for $130 yeah yeah
that's what I'm talking about right
there
buy it now what I'm talking about
reshaping two of 470 right now for a
hundred and thirty dollars
what about another one from the one
below X 100 only 125 18 let's look at
the 580 3300 G bit on that what is
there something wrong with this no it's
just if you're just liquidating them
right now I think the bid like it's just
more time oh there was an action that's
why yeah bye
look at that rx 580 hundred and ninety
dollars pretty good for a game yeah
we're super geek so that's uh it's kind
of where it should be
yeah well yeah because you know these
people probably bought these cards
before or at least at the very start of
the mining craze where the cards maybe
hadn't inflated an insane amount just
yet so they're probably able to sell
them back to closer to retail Christ I
would think yeah I mean certainly these
look kind of legit so yeah I'm an sold
listings I wonder how many of these
cards are from the same guy like you
might raise my baby a gigabyte Radeon rx
580 like oh these are and these are
listings that have ended apparently the
word is out are they recent though all
right well anyway
point is that aetherium has been a
little shaky recently and in fact just
over the last weekend's after hitting
the $400 high that hit in June it was
around one hundred and eighty four
dollars on Friday it dropped down below
hundred and fifty bucks on Sunday it
actually got as low as a hundred and
thirty but today my goodness today look
it bounced back so low point today was a
hundred and eighty two hundred eighty
three bucks Pete's just actually a
couple hours ago I think boom at 267 99
and then it dropped back to chuck all
the way back down to 240 it's on its way
back up so yeah it seems to have bounced
back a little bit all this is to say you
know if you've been waiting to buy a
graphics card you might need to wait a
little bit longer since we were looking
at finished auctions there and that
auctions that are on right now but their
prices aren't do seem to be coming down
the difficulty of mining has gone up so
the prospect of telling someone like hey
by these two graphics cards mine with
them for a month or two months you'll
pay for the graphics card and then
you'll start making profit it's just
becoming less viable of an option people
who have graphics cards already and are
mining with in like to keep mining the
you know do what you do but because of
the increased difficulty and earlier
today because of the drop in price we're
not sure how this is going to work out
if it's going to go back below 200 bucks
again or anything obviously it is one of
those things that changes based on how
many coins are being mined in the
marketplace and all that speculation
also changes on stuff like a seven
million dollar aetherium heist this was
crazy
look at that corn - alright so Quinn - I
don't know what coin - is I think I
don't really know what coin - was
supposed to I don't know if it's a new
type of cryptocurrency but they had and
I what is equivalent of an IPO the
initial coin offering the IC o----
so I think this is a new cryptocurrency
yeah Quinn - but anyway the people who
in charge of coin - had a website they
put their aetherium address on their
website and said investors start sending
aetherium our IC is IC o---- is open you
can invest right now and give us a
theory m and then you'll you'll get our
you'll you know you're basically buying
this currency but hackers hacked it
replaced the address with their own haha
and basically got about seven million
dollars worth of etherion over the
course of a very short period of time
and actually said that was seven million
dollars when this article was written
which was actually that was earlier
today by the world by the end of today
it's probably worth even more and I
would put it somewhere between eight and
ten million dollars worth in fact
there's people on reddit there's a
reddit thread about this linked in the
article and the people on reddit are
saying like it looks like an inside job
which seems like I mean who knows it
could be but yeah the the website posted
a statement is unfortunate for us to
announce that we have suffered a hacking
attack during our tokens sale event
during the attack seven million dollars
were stolen by a currently unknown
perpetrator basically people who sent
aetherium to that fraudulent email
address are out of luck and and
yeah transactions sent any fraudulent
address after our website was shut down
will not be compensated Oh
so after the website was shut down so
maybe they're working on something for
the people who who were duped in some
way because obviously you don't want to
pissed off all your potential investors
right what a nightmare that's pretty
crazy that's not how you want to start
off unless you're a hacker so hey why
you're ICO to go all right thanks
the Atari bucks has a little bit more
information on it not a lot we talked
about this briefly so there are a couple
more pictures if you guys are interested
Atari is saying that this is a retro
gaming console that we'll be able to
play both retro and current games what
ends it's not really a hundred percent
sure all right what that means but the
pictures themselves you can actually
make out
of the connection points at least it's
got four USB ports as well as a SD card
slot reader an HDMI output an Ethernet
port on the back and according to the
article on legit reviews Forbes actually
also covered this and they said they
think this is going to be something
along the lines of the Ouya mmm that
will be able to run a current current
gen game apps thanks to packing
something like an Android operating
system or a Windows micro console inside
so it'll have some sort of emulator for
Atari games but then also be able to
play you know Android based games or
perhaps Atari will make something like a
small marketplace where they can develop
new games for it or something like that
who knows but that's the thing don't
know you guys know more about it
alright we talked about this also last
week but I wanted to follow up on the
vrm thing for X 299 motherboards there
Bauer who is a well-known overclocker
threw out some critiques against a lot
of the motherboard manufacturers for
their cooling on VRMs and some of the
BRM configurations on x-29 and i
motherboards and especially when
overclocking the chips with specific
settings lined up they could get
extremely warm and it was depending on
how you were testing things it was a
question of whether the CPU or the VRMs
was going to be what overheated and
throttled to your overclock first asus
has been designing and recently
redesigned the rampage 6 apex which is
what you can kind of see the heatsink
for right here so the apex basically
they have improved the cooling on by
redesigning the vrm cooling block and
adding what are known as fins stacks of
fins for increased surface area kind of
highly effective apparently is something
that manufacturers used to know how to
do but but kind of forgot how to do or
something like that there's a lot of
criticism as far as like going more for
aesthetics versus practical actual
dissipation of heat and that kind of
thing with these types of boards this is
a very skewed picture by the way this
board is not quite this wide its
it's a little bit skinnier but um but
yeah you can see they can sink up here
and this is actually the original
version that where you can see that
didn't have right that design so it's
just more like a single contiguous block
of aluminum or whatever's going on the
island therefore the material that's
being used so they worked with her
Barrow directly on this they
collaborated for with his input he was
like hey more surface area physics and
he has video up on it which is linked in
this article so you guys can check that
too if you want
yeah now there's gonna be like some isus
assassin trying to like hunt down to
Bower
even though they worked with him they'll
elaborate or perhaps unless they were
setting him up for the assassin they
were luring him and to gain his
confidence that's that's probably more
Azam positive that's what's going on and
I would assume that - yeah all right
that's all I have for my prepared
materials for today so let's quickly go
in and see if we have any donation
questions that were asked of us we do we
do that we have several so let's get
through those first up we've got
automatic Mets who donated Tendo oh this
is a message from cell no be doing $10
but was on the phone then forgot to grab
it I'm so sorry feels bad oh oh I forgot
to grab it oh he probably missed the
message or whatever Oh from Matt so he
saw that matt doheny but he was on the
phone with us maybe or someone else so
he forgot to actually input whatever
message was attached to the donation but
either way thank you very much Matt for
your donation thank you Matt always
thanks good el Hefe reviews $5 thanks
for the shout out last week on Pitt my
PC here's a beer on El Jefe Cheers
cheers to you all have it here's I'm out
of beer so I can't choose you it's very
soon we've also got Mike dudes for five
bucks no comments thanks Mike dude thank
you Mike
Sebastien krauser krauser krauser
for 10 bucks another 10 bucks for you
guys starting a small game studio so I
really appreciate you your hardware you
hardware guys giving me a good idea of
what's coming now cool yeah you're
welcome
that sounds like fun a game studio it
sounds relaxing a studio where your game
in
disinvite us once it's all done Oh Scott
Dilbeck six dollars and sixty six cents
I see what you didn't think he's gotta
think of a random question this week so
chug chug
thanks guys plus Kyle next week pin my
pc hook a brother up already I don't
check because I'm doing all the drinking
so I'm gonna it's a truce and I'll take
a drink you have to choose for both of
us see I used to drink you have to check
for both of us
you need more beer I'll replenish my
beer very shortly very soon David Brooks
for the 20 a 20 Australian maybe I
believe Australian no comment thank you
very much David witness k10 Canadian
Canadian dollars and Canadians you guys
have the best tech oriented tech show
ever
no and you guys should definitely try
less one of the best beers ever for hot
summer days that I know you guys have
lots of yeah it's been pretty brutal
recently yeah it's not like incredibly
incredibly hot just very consistently
hot and and actually more humid than it
usually is here which sucks
yeah but thank you for your attention
yeah that looks low that left I just
handled it like I google it looks
refreshing oh it looks like a crisp
kinda looks like a Heineken emotion yeah
I know it's all green good sipping beer
next up we've got Ronan ruining road
9300 decay the seventy dick DKK good
Danish Democratic Democratic um Danish
Crona Danish Kronos is you think we
would know this by now
hey guys need to split but here's a
donation from the people of Denmark and
a fellow techie keep up the good work
I still owe you a beer Kyle yes you do
Prost I'm still waiting on it thanks
Ronan Jeremy Vash for the 21 million
running a seven eight 1700 X and would
love to go Vega but have a 1440 144
Hertz g-sync monitor outta luck or
would there be much difference
oh and split this with the bit please uh
you probably would want to stick with
Nvidia honestly honestly if you like
your monitor because you can't do you
can't do g-sync with a with
Vega curtain you just you just can't
that's part of what they want to do when
it comes to like g-sync being
proprietary is they want to get you into
that ecosystem so you'll need to keep
buying their graphics cards yeah which
is intelligent to some degree but yeah
if you've already got the monitor and
you like your monitor and you're not
planning on replacing it I would say
stick with Nvidia consider something
like a 1070 1080 1080 TI wait wait till
before you buy something wait till Vega
comes out because if it's competitively
performing alongside the GTX 1080 and
who knows Nvidia might drop the price on
the 1080 some yeah get a better deal on
or you might you might be in a situation
where you can sell your g-sync monitor
and get a cheaper freesync monitor and
use that with Vega yeah that could be an
option too yep
okay one super source for ten bucks hey
guys decided to get the air 540 now
running in r5 1600 waiting for my cryo
rig backplates to be able to overclock
as high as I can also Windows 10 is
confused whether I need to activate it
again
if you've already activated windows on a
particular motherboard it should
automatically reactivate when you
reinstall Windows 10 if you install the
same version because when you activate
it does a forget what the type of key is
called but it burns up the key that you
plug in and it makes a new special
hidden key that's tied to your hardware
but it should recognize your hardware
and automatically activate Windows when
you reinstall if not you might need to
do phone activation or one of those
options yeah but just make sure to make
sure if you do phone activation and they
say how many systems is this copy of
Windows been installed on the answer is
always 1 ok yes
Jones $10 what is your take on thread
Ripper do you think the 12 core for 800
is a better value than the 16 core for a
thousand what's your take on it and how
much do you think the motherboards will
be I think it just boils down to how
many cores you actually need for
whatever it is you're doing you know
there's a lot of stuff that isn't gonna
really do much with 16 cores right now
yeah that's just how it is yeah a lot of
software is it designed that way yeah so
twelve core might be something that's
more for like a crossover where you need
a little bit more frequency
you know if you are gonna like dabble in
gaming as well or something like that in
write rise in with a higher frequency
and a nice high frequency memory can do
a pretty pretty good job at that
and I would imagine the 12 core might
overclock a little bit better yes
essentially worse yeah yeah so I would
say I would take a long hard look at the
software you're planning and using and
maybe potentially wait until after
launch so you can see find out some
somehow somewhere how the software
you're planning to use performs these
two processors whether that 200 bucks is
worth it because it doesn't seem like
that much like 200 more bucks for 16
cores instead of 12 right right and
that's a lot more thread it should be it
should be 750 dollars and a thousand
don't say that out loud
then it would name they might be
watching that it would be equally good
many of these terrible how much I think
the motherboards will be the x3 ninety
nine boards probably in the same say mr.
X too many and I am pretty much you're
gonna be my desktop level you'll find a
budget one for you know maybe maybe 200
if you're lucky
probably more like 220 230 for the
budget range 250 to 300 is where you're
kind of good boards will sit and then
you'll have like really fancy boards
that are more than that but thanks to
this next up we've got Larry Larry
Froning $5 no comment thank you very
much for the donation
baby child for the $5 got my a 2 volt eg
and the co say 570 X's in the mail today
cannot await to set it up and goof up
short my system with a wreak curl up in
a bar and finery crash oh yeah that
won't happen now with the terrible
little 1840 G will you view message that
was it easy to use it's very easy yeah
it takes some time to setup and stuff
because it's a full custom loop yeah um
but no the instructions are very clear
step-by-step nothing really went wrong
for me so I'm pretty sure you can handle
it baby you've got this you've got this
girl's video it'll tell you everything
you need to know thank you for the plug
Paul um no okay so we were doing boils
again
Jonathan Mercado $10 this show is lit
homies yeah hashtag first time live
viewers hey
Jonathan thanks John appreciate your
viewing we open we open even even Connor
ten Aussies ten acido Aussie bucks I'll
call him Aussie bucks I have a budget
box of a I five sixty five hundred and R
X 480 a one terabyte sshd with a 1080p
60 Hertz monitor which components or
things should I upgrade first the CPU to
rise in 1600 graphics m2 SSD or monitor
to 1440p I kind of like your setup for
right now I don't think you're really in
need of a big upgrade so yeah I might
start looking at monitors cuz your
monitor will give you a reason to
upgrade the rest of the stuff and you
can handle a decent amount of stuff at
1440 right now yeah and I 1440 monitor
if you're really not getting the frame
rate you want at 1440 you can always
just play 1080 on it scales perfectly
fine yeah so oh yeah don't look around
at a monitor and you got an SS HD - that
would probably be my secondary option
but an SS HD is gonna give you a lot of
the same responsiveness that you get
with an SSD yeah so yeah that's him
honor yep I agree turtle and training
$10 hey guy just one just one of us we
don't know who that's directed to only
one of us I'm considering jumping into
1440p or 4k I have a I 74770 kcp you
it's stockin was wondering if I upgraded
to a 1080i or Vega
well my cpu bottleneck the system if so
will overclocking the little
overclocking help the bottleneck um I
honestly think that that's a fair
pairing there yeah you're probably okay
I mean any bottleneck that might occur
it's not gonna be detrimental to your
gaming performance - to invalidate how
much you're spending on the graphics
card
yes sample yes overclocking will help
though yeah of course
mm-hmm it's free performance so you
might as well do it as long as you have
a decent cooling system on your CPU and
depending on your 4770k you should be
able to get at least four point five
four point four or four point five yeah
if you're lucky you can get four six
four seven below one point 4 volts
hopefully yeah on a good chip even less
than that with 4770k actually I guess
one point three three two four one three
to five is this how you want as you want
to go reasonably for something you want
to leave there okay if I recall
correctly I hope I'm recalling it seems
like so long ago doesn't know so much
just happen it's like it's a barely two
generations old okay Sebastian Casilla
for the 50m arse
I just saw an NZXT power supply to Hale
a t2 v2 700 watt bronze is it worth it
or should I go for another brand great
show as always that's a very difficult
question to answer without knowing the
price yeah cuz those are it's perfectly
fine power supply right now it's not
like crazy high-end or anything but how
much does it cost damn it it's five
dollars you should buy if it's like 40
50 bucks us and it's in good shape then
it's probably an okay deal
twenty or thirty bucks and it's probably
a good deal it's anything more than that
then probably not yeah agreed next up
we've got a Dmitry Dmitry Gromov didn't
grimace demos do good mo Ostin it's a
ten British pounds thank you very much
that look let make some minor hates hate
me I've got to 1080 eyes and 510 70s
fully paid off and still mining at 25
GBP per day suck it haters ah
he's sticking it to all the mining
haters well you know do what you got to
do man um 25 G beat GBP per day that's
that's over that's like what 30 35 bucks
us thereabouts
depends on the time of day and that kind
of thing I mean yeah but yeah that's not
bad actually I wonder how many if you
get 510 70s in sure yeah that's it's
