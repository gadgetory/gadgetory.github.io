what's up everyone I am kicking off 2016
with a much requested video on how to
make a time-lapse now there are lots of
different ways to make a time-lapse this
isn't necessarily here's the only way to
do it I'm actually going to show you
three different ways that I figured out
how to do it for myself and there's
other ways too so leave those down in
the comments section while you're maybe
hit the like button if you enjoyed this
video but let's start off with the three
ways that I'm going to show you today
one is just recording a video and I'm
going to use a standard camcorder for
that second way is to take pictures with
a camera ideally with an intervalometer
and then the third way is just going to
be you use a webcam so even if you have
a laptop with a built-in webcam you can
make a time-lapse even if you don't
necessarily have a camera now before I
dive into my three methods let's start
with three general best practices for
shooting a time-lapse whether using my
methods or whether you're using your own
you should always number one use a
tripod or a fixed mount your camera
should be immobile it should not move
and you should even place that tripod
ideally somewhere where it's not likely
to get kicked or bumped at all is having
that static camera this is the number
one key thing to getting a nice smooth
time-lapse number two is to use the
manual settings that your camera has to
offer the camera should not do anything
by itself without you telling it to that
means no automatic exposure no autofocus
no auto white balance turn all those
auto functions off and adjust everything
yourself so you have it set up right
when you start the time lapse that way
there will be no ships or changes as the
time-lapse progresses the third thing is
to think long term just generally
speaking while you're setting up your
shots while you're adjusting your camera
is your time lapse just going to take a
few minutes or is it going to go for a
few hours or a few days even how might
the light change over the course if you
have the Sun coming up and going down
we're able to action take place within
the frame that you're setting up getting
a wire shot is often a better way to go
because you can always crop it in later
and then last I would say always always
use an AC adapter if you can to plug
into your camera for constant power so
you're not relying on a battery and then
have lots and lots of storage available
like you know 64 128 gig cards so you
can just set it and forget it and not
worry about running out of space so
moving on to the first way that I make
time lapses and that you can easily make
time lapses too and that is pretty much
to just point and shoot so you set up
your camera you hit record you record
video and then you bring it into an
editing program later I'm going to be
using
mere and you just speed it up to 2,000
or 4,000 percent or something like that
the pros to this method is that it's
pretty easy you can just point the
camera and hit record another nice thing
about it is that you won't be waiting
for your footage to render out later on
as you would with taking a bunch of
pictures and we'll be getting to that in
just a second as far as what that means
you can slow down the footage too when
you're recording straight video so you
could suddenly slow down to real-time
and you might even actually have usable
audio in there as well so that gives you
a little bit of flexibility for editing
in the future now there are some cons
that go along with this as well one is
that you will have very large file sizes
especially if you're shooting in 4k and
especially if you're shooting longer
takes so that makes this kind of
impractical for longer time lapses if
you're shooting something to say an hour
or less you're probably good but if you
want to go three four or five hours or
multiple days you just you're not gonna
have enough space doing that and
scrubbing through footage that's a shot
at 1080 thirty frames per second and
then sped up 5,000% can be pretty clunky
especially if your system is slower or
you don't have really fast storage
speeds so that's something to think
about if you're worried about the
post-production side of it some general
tips for using this standard method is
one to use it for shorter time lapses so
let's say an hour or less I often use
this method if I'm just shooting a build
that I know won't take too long also
consider using a lower frame rate to
conserve the disk space setting this
camera to 24 frames per second rather
than say 30 frames per second might use
up a little bit of less space and just
give you a little bit more room to work
with method number two for making a
time-lapse is just to take pictures but
you need to take lots of pictures and
that need to be evenly regulated for
that you need something called an
intervalometer newer cameras like my
panasonic lumix lx7 as well as my GH
fourth i'm using the film this right now
have an intervalometer built into the
software and in fact even my older
camera the 5d mark ii didn't have one
built in but i was able to get a third
party kind of firmware add-on called the
magic lantern that allowed me to do it
some cameras have an external device
that you can purchase to do it but for
today I'm just going to be using my
built-in feature right here which is
really nice to have so if you're looking
for a camera and you want to do this
then definitely look for one that has a
built-in intervalometer that will allow
you to set the camera to take a picture
every say one two
five seconds and you can make it longer
shorter than that generally speaking
when I'm shooting I usually go for about
one every say three seconds maybe four
seconds if you're shooting something
that will take longer like multiple days
or you're doing photography of plants
growing or something like that consider
doing a much longer interval 5 seconds
10 seconds 20 seconds or more and here's
a quick look at how I set up the
intervalometer on the gh4
time lapse mode for the gh4 is pretty
simple just make sure on this main dial
you're set to full manual mode not the
manual video mode although manual video
mode is awesome then ever again this
little jug that you got to switch it all
the way over to this guy and which is
the opposite side from that one which is
take a single picture and then there's
burst mode in a couple more so but all
the way over to that and you know that
you might notice down here it will give
you the start time-lapse option if you
hit the menu button you can go in and
adjust some of the time-lapse functions
such as when it starts and how long the
interval is between shots I have it set
to 3 seconds and how many images it
should take before it stops which I
usually set to the max which is 9999 see
how that's said here you just take a
picture and then it will continue taking
pictures every 3 seconds until it hits
9999 or it runs out of space on the
memory card so as long as you can take a
picture every so often then you can make
a time lapse with it which means that a
smartphone is another viable option for
something like this you can get an app
set up your smartphone with the some
kind of rigged old it in place and then
go that route I'm not going to be diving
into that for this video but it's
another option if you guys want to look
into it the pros for this method are
that in my opinion it provides the best
end results the best quality and just
the sharpest image as long as you took
good pictures that were in focus of
course the final rendered time-lapse is
also going to be very high in quality
but very small and file size relative to
say a single long video that you record
all at once or even all of the
individual pictures that you originally
capture because there can be a big
difference between the size of the
pictures and the size of a rendered
video my method results in a 4k video at
the end of it for at least for this
method and that's really great as well
for panning and zooming so if I'm doing
a 1080 video but I have a 4k image then
I can take that 1080 frame and move it
around there are some cons to this
method that
should keep in mind though one is going
to be that importing and rendering a
time-lapse with thousands and thousands
of photos can take a really long time so
you might need a higher-end system or
you might just need a lot of patience to
go along with that the raw images that
you take when you're doing thousands of
photos this way can also take up a lot
of space and I've had some projects that
had 30 to 50 gigs just in RAW images for
a time-lapse the nice thing about that
though is that after you've rendered all
those photos into a single video file
then you can delete all the photos and
just keep the file and you're generally
speaking okay the final thing you might
consider is that your shutter count is
going to go way up on the camera that
you use so my old 5d mark ii that i use
this for as a little concerned that the
shutter count was getting really really
high on that can also wear out that
mechanism generally speaking not an
issue because most cameras can take tens
of thousands of photos without a problem
but just something to point out some
general tips for this method are that
you will definitely definitely want to
use an AC adapter this one is for this
but i've AC adapters that go to these
cameras as well and you will want a
memory card that has lots of space again
you with the time-lapse you want to just
set it up hit go and then not really
worry about it for quite a while you
should also give yourself a bit of extra
time to render these time lapses because
I definitely been in a situation where
I'm like I want to edit this video right
now and then I'm like oh I need to wait
like I don't know an hour - depending on
how diligent I'm about refreshing things
just to import all the stuff and then
render it and again I'll show you in
just a minute how long that actually
takes the third thing is that you should
always remember to resize your photos
after you add them into your premiere
timeline and again I'll show you that in
just a second my third method is the
webcam method and this method can be set
up with just a simple laptop webcam and
the software and the software I'm going
to be using is called Crona lapse I
found this a while back and it's worked
great for me so I have continued to use
it
just remember to run it as administrator
the webcam I'm using today is the
Logitech c920 although if you have a
laptop with a built-in webcam you can
use that just as well so again you don't
really need to necessarily have a camera
in order to use this method once you've
launched the software you can select
your webcam that's plugged in hopefully
and choose the resolution and the frame
rate that you want it to capture at
definitely use the preview function to
set up your shot and make sure you're
capturing everything properly and make
sure it looks good and that can
thing and then from there you can just
simply enter a number of seconds that
will elapse between the time that it
captures each image the pros of using
this method are that it has a minimal
hardware investment so if you just have
a laptop that's all you really need and
a webcam of course or PC and webcam also
you can use this method to capture say
your desktop that you're working on so
if you do a lot of Photoshop work or
something like that you want to do
time-lapse of it you can use that you
could even connect like a real camera to
this using a capture card of course you
would have to pay for a capture card and
capture straight from that which is
something I've considered doing but I
haven't quite done yet small USB webcams
like the Logitech c920 are also very
easy to position in interesting places
since they're pretty small and I have a
USB extension that I can use to position
this like up above my head for those
kind of cool top-down shots that I get
while I'm building computers the other
nice thing about this is that you can
capture straight to an external SSD
which is a what I do with a laptop I
have it connected to that way I can just
take that SSD connect it to my editing
system and it's really fast I can render
straight off of that or I can just copy
the images very very quickly
the cons to this method well the major
number one comm is just that you're
going to get webcam image quality the
resolution is not going to be as good as
a real camera so my webcam time lapses
don't typically look as sharp and clean
as ones I do with normal cameras also
depending on the resolution and the
frame rate that you're capturing at with
this software at least I found that
image tearing can occur at certain times
although when it's sped up really fast
it's really not too noticeable some
general tips would be to first always
make sure you go in and use the webcam
software in this case it's Logitech
software to turn off any of the
automatic functions that it might have
like autofocus auto white balance and
auto exposure face tracking that kind of
thing you don't want it doing any of
that also you can use a lower you set it
to a lower resolution and then hit
preview and you can use that to frame up
your shot but then close that and go
back out and then choose one of the
highest resolutions possible because
that's just going to get you the best
image quality and shrinking it down will
improve the sharpness with it just a
little bit remember the webcams can
often capture single images at a much
higher resolution than their raid
for video so even though this does 1080
video it actually captures it something
closer to 2k I forget exactly what it is
so your next question would probably be
well now that I've captured my video or
my thousands of pictures how do I then
take that and transform it into a nice
clean looking time-lapse well I'm going
to be using Adobe Premiere and I will
show you how to do that right now and
here's the promise to creating a
time-lapse in Adobe Premiere tutorial
I'm using premiere 6.0 but should be
roughly the same for Creative Cloud I am
going to first create a new project with
my 4k preset that I already have you can
make one for yourself as well I'm then
first before I do anything go to
preferences and then general and then
change my still image default duration
to two frames this is very important
next up I'm going to make a new bin and
then go ahead and grab all my pictures
and import them now you will have to
wait for a little while because
depending on how many pictures you're
importing depending on your system and
depending on your storage configuration
this can take quite a while for this
reason I always make a backup and then
copy on the pictures to a couple raid
zero SSDs which generally speeds things
up after the import finishes I'm going
to grab all the images and drag them
over to the timeline then we're going to
zoom all the way in so I can see the
very first images and I'm going to go
and resize it to match the frame size
usually they're a little bit larger than
4k so shrink them down usually to 84 86
% copy that motion effect that you just
made and then select all the rest of the
pictures on the timeline and then paste
the motion effect onto them this will
resize every image on the timeline and
now you're ready to export your krispy
4k time lapse just remember to use
proper export settings for 4k video and
you can go ahead and uncheck that audio
box and that is all for this video guys
