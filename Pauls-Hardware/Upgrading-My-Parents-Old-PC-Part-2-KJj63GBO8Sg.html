back to what is I guess my third video
on this particular build I've already
shown you the build process itself I
have also shown you how to get yourself
a Windows 10
om key for about $20 from King Gwinnett
which I have installed on here and is
working just fine so far I'm going to be
taking the system over to deliver it to
my parents today so I'm going to do a
little bit of a side-by-side comparison
of the old system and the new system
it's not going to be a fair fight by any
stretch but I do want to show hopefully
what kind of vast improvement that we've
made by going with a newer system with
an SSD and better fans and it should be
quieter and all that good stuff should
also be more energy efficient thanks to
at 80 plus gold power supply anyway
though let's get this started off
because before I head over to make
delivery I want to give this even a
better edge than it already has and that
is to take advantage of the fact that
we're using the Intel Pentium
anniversary edition g3 258 and we should
be able to overclock that so anyway also
I just booted up which was very fast I
meant to show you guys that ok my first
attempt to get into the BIOS failed
because it booted up too quickly so I'm
restarting to see if I can get there by
tapping the delete button on startup and
if it's still too fast then I'm gonna
have to use alternative means
alright good it worked alright so the
first thing I actually checked here was
my bios version right now we're on f6
there is an f7 version available but
that was just an update to support
Broadwell CPUs and since we're not using
that I think I can get away without
doing the BIOS update so here we can see
sort of the the frequency settings which
had popped us into automatically we got
performance upgrade we got CPU base
clock I think I'm just going to set the
base clock to right where it should be
my mouse is floaty can I punch this in
now punch in gigabyte 100 there we go
alright
other than that I'm not going to do a
whole lot of special goodness here I'm
just going to go to our CPU clock ratio
and let's try I'm just going to take a
shot in the dark
42 maybe we can do 42 for 4.2 gigahertz
overclock and we'll we'll just see if
this works
I guess I'd also need to turn this on
on with this on/off button alright I'm
going to keep it simple and just do that
same reset and see if we can get a clean
boot here if it does boot up fine I'm
just going to load up a quick little
load test in the operating system in
Windows 10 to make sure I don't get any
immediate failures and then I actually
better get going because I actually have
a lunch I'm going to have lunch with
gigabyte and Kyle and then go to my
parents house okay all right well good
news right off the bat is we've booted
so that's always nice okay so there goes
prime95 um I am pretty much just keeping
an eye on you know speeds and temps and
everything fortunately multipliers
looking good we're running at 4.2
gigahertz on both cores which you guys
can't see cuz I'm on the way hold on
hold on Hey okay we're weird 4.2
gigahertz on both cores as we can see
you down here for our peak we're
enabling speed States properly so it is
throttling down when it's not under load
temperatures are looking pretty good too
we've hit 57 c-max and right now I did
I'm just doing the blend test with
prime95 so I'm let it cycle through a
few of these and just kind of see how
things go and probably going to go and
get ready to to leave and I'll let this
sitting for the next five or 10 minutes
at least and honestly in in 99.5% of my
tests in the past if you leave a prime95
test running for about 15 minutes you're
almost guaranteed that it's it's going
to be good as far as a burning goes
sometimes might wanna leave running
overnight if you want to be like
absolutely for sure but for what my
parents are going to be doing on this
they never get e they're never going to
touch anything close to what prime95 is
doing so I think we'll be good for that
so I'll be right back and yeah I'm very
happy with this whole system so far it's
very snappy okay I'm back this has been
running for well let's say about 12
minutes now and
I'm happy with the results as is
everything staying within range
temps did creep up a little bit more but
we hit 64 65 degrees Celsius max which
is really not bad at all
voltage is 1.2 or just over 1.2 again I
didn't touch that in the BIOS or
anything and that's a perfectly
acceptable voltage to be running at so
I'm passing all the prime95 tests just
fine anyway though I'm going to get this
shut down and packed up I'm gonna head
over to my parents house I don't get to
show you guys my old mile bedroom that I
grew up in it's the computer room now
it's kind of fitting I guess look at
that look at that lovely picture right
there recognize see that's me this is my
sister's okay anyway here's my bedroom
through here my old bedroom so yeah I
remember I used my bed my bed's right
here just just right where I left it as
you can see man it seems smaller than it
used to be but I guess you know I'm
larger now so that's probably actually
others that this is a changing table my
sister lives here with my parents
currently and her and her husband my
brother-in-law that's the computer that
I built with him down there on the floor
place of shame for some reason I yell at
him when he gets back and tell him to
get that up off the floor anyway the old
room etc etc but basically like I said
it's been made into the computer room
this is the hutch sort of thing over
here I need to get them a new monitor
too that's probably gonna be next on the
list anyway old system is down there
let's let's take a look at what is
actually in that old system I don't we
check out the Suites this is I believe
the new mechanical keyboard from Corsair
it's right here uses the new Cherry MX
ultimate switches now this is this is
super old mouse and keyboard from
Microsoft look it's good
remember when everything was this beige
color entry glad stuff isn't that color
anymore and then look we also have a
trackball a Logitech trackball I really
don't like track balls but I'm I might
be forced to use this and I have a spare
mouse that I brought so maybe we'll
switch to that this one also looks like
it's gotten a fair amount of use anyway
though the computer itself is down here
in the little cupboard of shame this is
an antique Sonata case I do remember
that
but it's in one of these little cupboard
things they built you know because it's
like hey we have a computer that
generates a lot of heat let's make a
little box for it too
to shut it in so that everything gets
super warm this little box actually does
have a vents that's down there in the
back but there's also a shelf or that
like there maybe was a shelf in here at
one point that's been removed and set
along the side here towards the back
it's like completely blocking the outlet
so all right so I've heard this takes a
while to boot up we're gonna head power
and see how long it takes
hey we booted up hooray okay guys before
I put the system out of its misery I
wanted to do one or two other quick
tests the first test was just like what
the heck is even in this system actually
pulling up this properties panel when I
first booted took an insanely way to
long amount of time I can explain why
though anyway anyway but what's inside
this is an Intel Core 2 Duo II 8500 at
3.1 6 gigahertz it's got 4 gigs of RAM
and it's running on Windows 7 now one of
the main complaints about this system is
that is just so incredibly slow to do
anything whether it's booting up or
otherwise you might notice for example
that the hard disk drive is nearly full
it's only 250 gig drive in there and
there's only 971 megabytes of space left
that will almost always slow you way way
down when your main drive is almost full
it's also mechanical drive so that's not
good either but just to give a basis for
comparison here let's quickly start up
something simple how about Firefox
all right clicking in Firefox now and
let's see how long Firefox takes to load
that's working it's thinking about
Firefox it's like I might load Firefox
here wait what just happened oh yeah no
it's loading there it is oh we almost
got the Google logo
come on Google look there it is okay now
if that was a ridiculously long too much
amount of time for you to load up
something as simple as a web browser
well um I don't know clear out your hard
drive and hopefully your computer
doesn't load quite this slowly button
anyway that's enough testing with this
system it's driving me insane I'm going
to pull this out of here and switch to
the new system
here are the two computers side by side
new computer on the left
hopefully obviously old computer on the
right and apologies to you guys I know
the lighting in here is not all that
great and that my shadows in a shot
there's nothing I can do anyway
new computer you've already seen looking
super nice and sexy old computer this is
the Antec Sonata a case that I have used
several several occasions in the past I
learned eventually to hate this case
because the power supply can't be
removed without pulling it through this
section and I had a power supply die and
an antique Sonata build and I had an
aftermarket CPU cooler on it that was
that big and basically I couldn't remove
the power supply without removing the
entire motherboard because the CPU
cooler had the backplate on it and yeah
I had to pull the whole thing out just
remove the damn power supply that's when
I fell out of love with the enttec
Sonata but other than that it's a pretty
nice case and if you're only using a
stock cooler like this one then you're
not going to be facing that problem but
hey check it out look there's some IDE
in here the motherboard is the p5 nd
which is an Asus board old standby on
LGA at 775 I believe is what this is I
also have a discreet graphics card
anyhow this is an AMD I don't even know
what AMD card that is the Sapphire
there's our trusty 250 gig drive
actually all all things consider the
cable management in here I did build
this system if you use back-end and hey
I fortunately it's still in pretty good
shape again I think it's mainly that
hard drive being fold it was causing
most of the slowdowns and everything
also the fact that it's a mechanical
drive and it's a using an 8500 Intel
chip instead of something that's you
know made within the past three years
all that said though all I'm really
going to do here just pull this hard
drive out drop it into here and that way
we can take all the data just as is and
pull it on to the new system and
everything and then I'll probably just
leave that old drive in there is a extra
storage drive or something like that
it's still got life in it ok let's move
on
you know WD 250 gig okay the swap has
been made new computer is down there in
the little cubby for the record I don't
I don't approve of these little cubby
things but this one does actually have
some holes down in here for some intake
ventilation and then there is that all
this area for air to escape in the back
not ideal but hey huh it's already there
I have switched over to this mouse a
wireless mouse which is nice and now I'm
just going to do another boot test to
compare the booting times for the new
system and the old system here we go and
how
and rebooted that wasn't too long at all
and now just in the comparison test to
just pull up a browser you're not pretty
pretty basic straightforward thing that
you would do with a computer right I am
using Chrome it's at a Firefox but there
it is that's how long I would expect it
to take like a legal uh Google look
there it is there's Google all right
very happy with the the change over so
far let's see if my mom thinks so guys
now we have come around to the moment of
truth I'm introducing you to my mom hi
mom hi guys okay mom say hi to the
internet internet be nice that's my mom
um and I wanted to give her kind of a
litmus test so mom if you don't mind can
you reach over there and turn on the new
computer and we're going to give a
little comparison here granted you guys
already saw that the time difference but
them my mom has been using the old
computer in its old state and I think
she might be a little bit more impressed
with this one just something I already
have I pushed the button and there was a
nearly immediate response all right
there it is it's booted all right so
just yeah so just that wasn't too bad
there's a little bit that's crazy a
little bit faster than the old one I so
just click anywhere and then your
password is the same except the first
letters capital and there is now you're
in Meaghan windows amazing it's almost
usable as a computer again okay and then
one last little test - and that's just
to launch Chrome and we'll check out the
weather and see how quickly we can
access that just a single click should
be all it takes and then we got a
shortcut that we made up at the top and
look the weather is just there amazing
you can see two degrees in February and
see that it's way too hot wait wait how
do then it should be yeah all right
that's crazy so do you think you might
actually start using the computer again
I might use the computer again yeah this
is just fun excellent fighting
all right mission accomplished and so
ended my little project to get by
parents a new computer I'm glad to have
gotten them an upgrade granted that old
computer probably could have been
rehabilitated with an SSD and that kind
of thing but hey going with some newer
hardware means we're using more energy
efficient
equipment that's not going to generate
as much heat reason a much better power
supply that's 80 plus gold rated that's
going to save a little bit on the power
bill and I'm very confident that this
little dual core system can do
everything that they need for the time
being the jury is still out on whether
or not I'll be able to convince my mom
to take a PC gaming but who knows maybe
I'll drop a graphics card in there in
the future and I'm sure there's other
applications for this computer as well
but in the meantime guys thank you so
