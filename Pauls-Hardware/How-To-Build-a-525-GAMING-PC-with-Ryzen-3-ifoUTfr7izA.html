what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware today I'm doing a how to build
a computer video to celebrate the launch
of Rison 3 Andy has had a lot of success
and actually the PC market place's and
very exciting this year because of
Andy's launch of Rison they started with
rising 7 then rising 5 now we have
rising 3 which our quad-core CPUs that
don't have SMT or simultaneous
multi-threading so you do get 4 cores
you just don't get 4 course in a threads
like you get with the rise in 5 series
so they seem to be very good price to
performance options because the
right-hand 3 1300 X only cops about $130
and then the rise in 3 1200 only costs
$109 both of them are quad core and both
of them are unlocked for overclocking on
my personal opinion you should pretty
much ignore the rise in 3 1300 X which
ships at a frequency of 3.5 gigahertz
base and 3.7 gigahertz turbo the 1200 is
clocked lower it has a 3.1 gigahertz
base and a 3.4 gigahertz turbo but since
both of these are unlocked for
overclocking just take that are 3 1200
and such at same frequency as the RF 3
1300 X and then you have an r3 1300 x4
20 bucks plus let me to quickly go over
choosing parts to build a budget gaming
computer because that's very important
in making sure you choose the parts that
are compatible as well as it will fit
within budget and then of course I will
be diving into an actual tutorial going
over step-by-step the process for
building the system that I have laid out
here today one final note before I get
into choosing the parts is that I
actually built most of this system
already and a live stream with a risin 5
CPU just a couple months back so I'll
post the link to that video in the
description if you watch more of a full
length walkthrough of the build process
versus this video which is hopefully
going to be a little bit shorter than
that one with so to build a desktop
gaming computer right now you basically
need seven
to put into the actual desktop computer
and those are right here and I write the
parts that you also need just to
actually use that computer or here in my
left like a monitor a keyboard and a
mouse as well as probably an internet
connection and that sort of thing
I'm not going to be focusing on those
today so the price that I'm talking
about is going to be just for these core
components for the build also you might
need a Windows 10 installation key and
for that you can check out my windows 10
for $20 it's more like 30 bucks now I'll
link that video in the description as
well as far as the seven components for
a desktop gaming computer you're going
to need a processor of course you will
need a motherboard that's - you will
need system memory that's three
you will need system storage that is
four you will need a power supply that
is five you'll need a case that six and
then since we're talking about a gaming
computer you will need a graphics card
as well that is seven and actually with
the rise in series of CPUs you need a
graphics card in order to get video out
because these CPUs don't have graphics
built into them like the Intel CPUs do I
haven't see builds that are aimed at a
specific price and I actually often do
that myself since every month at the
beginning of the month I do a couple
parts lists for people who are trying to
choose the parts for their computer
today I'm not necessarily focusing so
much on the price although from the
title of the video title is about a five
hundred twenty-five dollar system that I
thought I'm showing you guys how to put
together but I wanted to go about
choosing everything a little bit more
practically so we already know that
we're going to be using a rise in three
CPU and we'll say that we're going to be
using the rise in three 1200 which cost
one hundred and ten dollars well there's
our baseline price one hundred and ten
bucks and then we need to add on two
parts after that now if you're getting a
rise in three in my opinion you should
be able to overclock it so you're going
to want a be 350 chipset motherboard
from an B with the am for socket I'm
going to be using the AC C prime D 350 M
- a motherboard it's a little bit
smaller at micro ATX form factor versus
the full sized ATX form factor but that
will match up with my case which is also
microwave micro ATX and you can get a
solid B 350 motherboard that supports
overclocking on this platform for about
70 to 90 dollars and this one actually
cost about 85 bucks right now so there's
that cost now memory is actually a bit
challenging right now I'm going to be
using this Corsair Vengeance LP
kit it's low profile which is nice and
it's rated at 3000 megahertz transfer
speed having faster memory is a great
way to get more performance out of your
rise in processor and I like 3000 as
kind of kind of a starting off weight
although you can get away with slower
memory as well now sense memory is so
expensive right now I basically I'm
recommending an 8 gig configuration you
can either get a single 8 gigabyte stick
or you can get 2 4 gigabyte sticks but
either way you're probably going to end
up paying about 80 bucks for that when
you talk about ddr4 memory and 3,000
rated and I definitely recommend
checking your motherboard manufacturers
website first because they'll have a
verified memory compatibility list you
can look at that and see what the
motherboard manufacturer has tested to
verify will work with the motherboard
and the bios version that's currently
available for that next up is storage
and there's two ways to go about having
storage in a computer you need storage
because storage is long-term whereas the
memory will get white whenever the
system turns off storage remembers
information that is on it this is a
solid-state drive and I highly recommend
getting a solid-state drive if you're
building a computer right now simply
because they're very responsive and the
speed with which the operating system
loads when you're booting into Windows
the speed with which programs will load
up just the overall responsiveness of
your system will be greatly improved by
getting an SSD now you can get about 120
gig SSD for about 55 dollars right now
but the best price per gigabyte you're
going to find is actually with the
higher capacity SSDs at about 240 to 256
gigabytes those will cost you about 85
to 90 dollars though so for today I'm at
least as far as the build list goes
sticking with 120 gig version although I
am using this kingston hyperx as a
stand-in honestly most typical data SSDs
are can have a huge variance in
performance and they will all get you
that speed and responsiveness that you
want i also recommend a hard drive to
add into the system as well and i
usually say try to find an old hard
drive that you can reformat and reuse
otherwise you probably need to spend
about 40 to $50 on a one or two terabyte
hard drive to get the system rounded out
so you have storage to go along with
your SSD for a power supply you can get
away with a 40 to $50 80 plus bronze
created units I've chosen the EVGA 500
BQ right here you can get the EVGA 500 B
for about 45 bucks again it'll just get
the job done it's not going to look so
pretty the cabling might not be that
nice I have the BQ hues as all black
cabling but it does cost five or ten
bucks more but with a five hundred power
supply you can get the system up and
running and you'd also have a little bit
of wattage Headroom so if you decided to
upgrade your graphics card in the future
to something that uses more power
you'll be okay to do that case is next
and I have a cougar mini Tower here this
is a budget case it's only 40 bucks and
actually it's harder to find now for
some reason as as compared to a couple
months ago but a forty dollar budget
case again will get the job done I chose
this one because it has a painted
interior and it's micro ATX but there's
lots of options down in the forty-fifth
forty to fifty dollar range just look at
reviews and find a case that matches the
size of your motherboard as well as one
that you like to look up and reviews
check those reviews because that's very
important this cougar case is not all
that great but it's 40 bucks
and it just provides some housing and
two protection for the components that
are going to go inside now with all
those parts added to my shopping list my
current price for the desktop is about
four hundred and fifteen dollars but I
don't have a graphics card yet and the
graphics card and CPU are probably going
to be the most expensive components for
any desktop gaming system now for today
I'm going to be using a geforce gtx
750ti
for about one hundred and ten dollars
you can either get a GeForce GTX 750 Ti
2gig model or you can get an AMD Radeon
rx 560 which is also a two gig model and
both of those are perfectly adequate for
1080 gaming they're not super high-end
or anything like that but they will
again get the job done so you can play
some video games now for about a hundred
and forty dollars you can get the 1050
Ti for gig or you can get the RX 564 gig
those will give you a bit more
performance still good for 1080 gameplay
but then beyond that you're going to
have a hard time finding anything that's
very reasonable I found that as of today
at least for about 220 ish dollars you
can start looking at GTX 1063 gig
versions and then anything else in the
mid-range is just really really
overpriced though it all depends on what
you want that final cost of your system
builds end up
being how much money you're working with
and remember a graphics card is a really
easy thing to swap out so if a 1050 ti2
gig is all you can afford right now you
can get that start gaming and then it's
a simple thing to swap out another
graphics card once the prices come down
in the future or maybe once we get more
towards say Black Friday and you have a
bunch of sales going on so I went ahead
and pulled all of these components out
of the retail boxes and I pulled the
relevant stuff that you'll need as far
as accessories that are included out of
the boxes as well so for the motherboard
I have an i/o shield this is very
important it actually installs in this
little spot here at the back of the case
I also pulled out a serial ata cable
because we'll need to connect that up to
our SSD and then I also pulled out the
user guide because it's just important
or helpful to have on hand depending on
plugging in front panel connectors and
that kind of thing SSDs just so Eric is
chilling I got both my memory sticks
laid out of course nothing extra to go
along with those and of course the CPU I
pulled out now the CPU you should be
careful with it is delicate I keep it in
the clamshell on time ready and it's got
pins on the bottom you should be careful
not to bend this will come with a reef
cooler I believe this is a version of
the race itself that means we don't need
to purchase an aftermarket two CPU
cooler to keep things cool on the CPU
side it also means that we have some
thermal paste that's pre applied on the
bottom there so we're just going to be
using that so we won't need to worry
about thermal paste also going to keep
that sitting in the box until it's ready
to go
graphics card is out and good to go as
well power supply is out and good to go
as well this is partially modular so
it's got a couple cables that are
attached all the time and then it's got
these modular plugs here and since the
graphics card doesn't need extra power
to plug into it it's only it's going to
get to all its power through the PCI
Express connection all we need for the
power supply as far as extra cables is
this modular SATA cable that is to
provide power to our SSD as well
now as far as the stuff that I'm using
to build things I just have rubber mat
to put like the motherboard on when I'm
working on it that's to protect both the
motherboard as well as this table from
getting scratched up couple screwdrivers
just standard Phillips head is usually
all you'll need and then I did but do a
couple add-on pieces for this build one
was an additional fan this case only
comes with a single fan which I believe
is set up
to exhaust added a one and as an intake
in the front as well so 120-millimeter
free and you can get first cheapest five
bucks or so they're usually ten ten to
twenty bucks for a decent one this one's
a freckle venturi and I also got just
the tiny little splitter so I can take
one of the plugs on the motherboard and
split it to plug two fans into it
because we've only got two fan plugs
headers on this motherboard one is for
the CPU and then it's only got one other
chassis fan header right here since we
have two chassis fans splitter will let
allow us to plug both of them in so the
first thing you're going to want to do
is get your motherboard set up and I
usually like to do this outside of the
case just makes it a little bit easier
and you've got a socket here that's at
the center with a lever that holds
things in place you've also got this
existing ham format right here and we're
actually not going to use this the
amount that ships with the rising three
CPU that we got actually doesn't use
these top retention brackets so first
let's remove those really quick next we
can go ahead and install our CPU so go
ahead and pull that out of the clamshell
now pay very close attention here
because there is a gold triangle on one
corner of the CPU there's also a
triangle indentation on one corner of
the socket as well
so keep an eye on both of those and you
want to make sure to line those up just
lift up the little lever arm on the
socket line up that triangle in the
proper corner and just gently set it
right on top it should drop right in
once the pins all line up like it did
just there zero insertion force so don't
need to push down on it at all it should
just drop right in there and then close
the lever and it is secured in place now
we can go ahead and install the heat
sink fan on top of it choose which way
you want your AMD logo to go facing that
way or facing this way and we're going
to go ahead and do it this way and just
set it down on top try to keep things
even but since you have that thermal
paste pre applied and kind of spread out
it's not going to be too challenging
basically just line that up on top and
then go ahead and tighten down all four
screws once it's lined up on top though
I'd like to just get each corner started
and threaded just to get things sort of
attached don't tight
one corner down all the way though
before you start to the others you want
to kind of do it in a opposite pattern
so give each side a couple twists and
that way you won't put too much pressure
down on one corner of the CPU that's
something you want to avoid all right
that's all secured on there it just went
straight through to the back plate at
the back of the motherboard and now we
just have this single cable here it's
got a four pin plug on it since that our
CPU fan we just plug it into the four
pin CPU fan header it's right over here
next up we'll install our memory and I
purposely chose this motherboard because
it has 4 memory slots that means that we
can install one or even two right now
and still have a couple to add more
memory in the future if you choose to do
so now double check your motherboard
manufacturers a manual that's why I kept
that out and which memory slot station
popular is an order I happen to know
that wood 8 with Asus they do every
other slot so we're going to go with the
second and four slots right here and
we're just going to take our memory note
there's a little notch there right in
the center and that is actually not
centered it's slightly off-center so we
want to make sure that that notch lines
up with the notch that's on the actual
Bhim slot itself which is right about
there should line up and either side
push down and you know you'll notice
there's only a latch on one side on this
motherboard that is okay some of the
boards have latches on both sides but
just apply firm pressure straight down
you should hear a little bit of a snap
as it goes down into the socket and
you'll find that that latch pinches up
and locks down and we'll just do the
same exact thing with our second stick
over here
so the motherboard should pretty much be
good to go so we can shift our attention
over to the case now and we want to do a
couple things to make sure the case is
prepped and ready to go
now one thing that's very important is
going to be a motherboard stand off
these a little brass standoffs screws
they are conductive and they need to be
positioned on the motherboard tray
actually here here here here and then
two more down at the bottom so there's
six total two four and six if using a
larger sized motherboard or a full sized
ATX case you might have up to nine of
those that you need to make sure are in
the proper place typically the case will
have some sort of labeling as to where
those go and you can also double-check
your motherboard yourself as far as
where the standoff locations might be
and just so you guys can see them here
as well - they're on the top - here in
the middle and two more down there at
the bottom beyond that I've also
installed my head and 20 millimeter
intake fan here at the front just to
grab the bottom of the chest front of
the chassis you can pull that entire
panel off and then just screw that in
from the front and then I also made sure
that my cables are kind of tucked away
down here at the bottom so I can wrap
stuff up properly and we're definitely
going to want to make use of the
accessories that came along with the
case they were just tucked in a little
baggie have screws to screw in the
motherboard stand off I also have a lot
more standoffs if I happen to have
needed more and then of course the
ever-important installation of the i/o
shield which I'm going to try to do on
the fly right now so shields can be
quite finicky sometimes and this is not
a high-end one so beware of sharp edges
on it but you'll notice it kind of lines
up here placing it from the inside and
will just kind of want to pop each
corner into place which sometimes takes
a bit of pressure and if it does give
you a hard time like this one is just
take the butt end of a screwdriver from
the back apply some pressure and you
should get it spot into place next let's
get the power supply installed and I'm
going to start off actually by
connecting that modular cable that I
needed for my SATA then this power
supply actually mounts at the top of the
case some power supplies mount at the
bottom but
since there is no exhaust or ventilation
at the top I'm going to point the fan
facing down so it'll be pulling air from
inside the case and then pushing it
across the power supply and ejecting it
out the back and it should mount up from
the back with four screws and we're just
about ready to install the motherboard
but I wanted to also drop the SSD in as
well and this case actually doesn't have
very good support for two and a half
inch drives it has a good support for
three and a half inch drives and it's
got a couple five and a quarter inch
drive slots for like optical drives in
the front but no straight 3.5 2.5 inch
drive mount so I actually just went
ahead and got a couple screws screws
that through the bottom just to mount
this sort of the here ghetto style that
says these aren't really that big of a
deal actually since there's no moving
parts inside they can just sort of hang
loose in a case or you can use velcro to
attach them or whatever you can get
creative is what I'm saying but in this
case I was able to just screw it through
the bottom there got secured it enough
that I'll be able to plug in the power
and data connectors right there when I
get to that and now let's go ahead and
drop that motherboard in what we say
motherboards are over here it's pretty
safe to hold the motherboard by the heat
sinks and once it's installed just you
know don't put too much pressure on it
and you'll notice the i/o on that side
of the motherboard right there I'm just
going to sort of angle that into the
case downward like so this might take a
little bit of moving around and wiggling
actually you know what I need to do it
the other way I'm going to go this side
in first if I can kind of flip that down
under the corner and then over here the
i/o and then we should start seeing
actual ports and what not poke at to its
back right of course they're not being
blocked by fan cable
okay I'll be honest that was super
annoying that there's all these little
contact points in here that are supposed
to go in and make contact with some of
the plugs sometimes you have to bend
them up out of the way or that kind of
thing just to get it to all go in but it
has gun and so our motherboard is
aligned in there the other thing that
we're going to keep close eye on right
now is now that the motherboard is
installed well not all the way as well
but and we should be able to see our
standoffs
through our standoff mounting points as
you can see along here next step we'll
just screw those in and remember as you
install motherboard screws just make
them snug you don't over tighten them if
you ever tighten them then when you try
to uninstall the motherboard which maybe
you'll do it someplace you might back
off the standoff as well probably super
annoying so with the motherboard all
secured most of our hardware is actually
in the system now aside from the
graphics card of course but we need to
start actually connecting things up to
the motherboard we have a bunch of
cables coming here from the front panel
get to those in just a second I went
ahead and connected up to my fans I
actually took the rear 120 millimeter
exhaust fan kind of tied up the cable
here and dip-dyed it and plug that into
one of the two leads coming off my fans
splitter down here at the bottom
second one needs to plug into this front
fan up here this one has a much longer
cable fortunately so I'm actually just
going to kind of tuck that down against
the motherboard it'll go under the
graphics card right there
and then it'll just go along the bottom
of the case I might might shred it push
it up behind the motherboard a little
bit if I can oh yeah that works kind of
keeps it down and out of the way and now
I think we'll go ahead and start
plugging in our actual power cables
coming from our power supply over here
now the basic idea with this as we have
two main power connectors that go into
the motherboard one is the eight pin
right there one of the 24 pin that's
right over there I mean it of course
that SATA power plug for this and that's
pretty much it so that's cool any of the
excess cables will just try to kind of
shove up here in this empty
in a quarter bay just to get them out of
the way and help give us good airflow
and I'm going to try to figure out how
how best to kind of wrap these down here
our is connected so next up is data at
least for the serial ata drive over
there so bear in mind when you're
plugging in SATA drives whether it's a
2.5 inch SSD like this or a full-size
3.5 inch mechanical drive there's two
plugs for each one one will provide
power and that comes from the power
supply and that is the longer cable or
longer plugs most both plugs are
l-shaped they have sort of a l-shaped
size on one end then there's a smaller
cable which is for data which also has
an l-shaped plug to it just make sure
you have those oriented the right way
and it should just pop right in there I
didn't we do need to plug in the other
side of our SATA cable to the SATA plugs
on the motherboard so there's a couple
right angle ones right here again oh
shoot blood just to make sure it's going
in at the right angle and it should snap
into place and kind of click and latch
and finally for connections to the case
we have these front panel connectors now
the long blue one on the left of USB 3.0
then there's USB 2.0 right next to it
notice that these are kind of also
differently keyed like the USB then the
front panel audio right there have
different pin outs you can reference
your motherboards manual for these as
far as what connects where and
especially the front panel connectors
because that is typically the most
annoying part of this whole ordeal but
yet hard drive LED power LED power and
reset switches are all labeled in these
and you need to make sure that those
connect to the appropriate tiny tiny
little pin out heads on the motherboard
itself which are down there usually
along the bottom edge
and finally we get the last piece of the
puzzle here our graphic skirt basically
you got a PCI Express long edge
connector down there at the bottom it
goes into the long edge connector PCIe
slot on the motherboard you also have
your video outs hits back and those of
course go out the back of the case now
like I said I've already built in this
case so I already removed these two PCIe
slot covers it is a double slot card so
it needs to remove two of them to line
up with this you might have to remove
different ones depending on what you
have there in what case you're using but
then of course we've got the two screws
that we're getting used to secure this
in place and the bear in mind that
little latch on the right side will it's
supposed to pop up and catch on the back
of that when it actually drops in
separately so let's see if we can do
that
and there you have it guys this is
pretty much the completed build and I
did this sort of quick and dirty for a
couple reasons like you might notice
some of the things that we get nitpicky
about at certain times like if you've
ever watched our live show that I do on
Tuesday evenings the cable management in
here isn't ideal but there's still
plenty of airflow coming from the front
intake fan down here it's all pretty
open in here there's nothing conflicting
with fans or anything like that and
everything is connected and plugged in
and it all it all came together pretty
well GPU down at the bottom again
doesn't need any extra power but if you
did have a higher-end graphics card that
did have a supplemental PCI Express
power connectors you would need to get
another one of those modular cables from
the power supply and write it down they
just plug that in but other than that
you know you know all the basics of how
to put together a little rise and three
base system here and this system well
this system as put together is going to
cost a little bit more than 525 but
using the parts list that I have in the
description you can see how you can put
together a really inexpensive gaming PC
on this platform the final steps before
of course you move on to the next stage
which is installing software and
everything is to of course plug in turn
on the power and then we'll just go
ahead and test our our front power
button right there there we go fans are
spinning up and we at least have an
initial indication that we've done done
everything properly so guys that pretty
much wraps it up for my how to build a
right-hand 3 gaming TC tutorial now if
you've gotten to this step and you're
wondering what to do next I highly
encourage you to check out my first 5
things to do with a brand new PC build
video I will link that occur as well in
the description down below to check that
out because that will take you from like
hey I put it together and the fans are
spinning up to like getting Windows
installed even so far as like setting up
steam and transferring games and all
that kind of stuff as well I'm excited
to test this system out it will be
following up with some benchmarks and
some performance on it I should also get
into the BIOS and adjust the fan speed
because right now they're running at
full speed and it's a little loud but
moving a lot of air that is all I have
time for today though so hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed this video and
leave comments in the comment section if
you have any questions a huge thanks to
any of you guys who are down there in
the comment
section answering the questions of
people who have asked them live and had
a chance to get to because there's way
more questions and I usually have time
to respond to thanks again for watching
guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
