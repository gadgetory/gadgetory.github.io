Computex I built a new testbed in a live
video that included successful Assembly
of the Praxis wet bench and I will link
that video in a card up in the top right
however I couldn't tell you my actual
intended CPU for this test bench the 69
50 X because it wasn't out yet also I
used a temporary motherboard because my
intended motherboard for this test bench
was the X 99 designate X from gigabyte
and it didn't arrive quite in time also
is quite a few of you pointed out this
is the Praxis wet bench and I air-cooled
with the CPU just doesn't seem right so
a bit of a rebuild as an order and here
the parts I will be using from the
original build I'll still be using the
sweet-looking Praxis wet bench in white
and gray and I'll carry over the g.skill
Trident Z 32 gig ddr4 3200 quad channel
memory kit and black and white the new
parts that I'm adding starting with the
gigabyte X 99 designate a X motherboard
it's black white and blue and it's got
steel reinforced slots and it has a pair
of YouTube ports and an MDOT 2 and it's
got a cool trick with the DisplayPort
input that can accept your discreet GPUs
video signal and pass it back out
through a USB type-c connector with
Thunderbolt 3 also look sexy sleeved
SATA cables anyway it's a perfect home
for the Intel Core i7 69 50 X the 10
Core Extreme Edition Broadwell a CPU
which is as drool-worthy as it is
overpriced for my operating system I'll
be going with the Intel 750 series 400
gigabyte SSD it's nvme reads and writes
of 2200 and nine hundred megabytes per
second respectively and I'll be using it
with a u2 adapter the power supply is
the gigabyte extreme gaming 1200 watt
PSU I know nothing about this power
supply other than that it's 80 plus
platinum and it got sent over along with
the gigabyte GTX 1060 which I tested an
ultra wide in my last video by the way
card up in the corner but it's got all
black cables fully modular and 1200
Watts gives plenty of headroom for multi
card configurations it's got pretty loud
orange labels though which doesn't
really match my color scheme but I don't
think they'll show fortunately Wow
hundred amp 12 volt rail and finally to
get this bench a little damp we have the
fractal Kelvin s 36 fulfilling my needs
for a CPU liquid cooler and a three here
sixty millimeter radiator copper by the
way to fill out the rad mount on the
back of the Praxis web bench
so here's where I realized that the
tubing on the Kelvin s 36 was not going
to be long enough to reach around and
get up to the CPU socket you're damned
right I said reach around by the way so
Plan B was to remove the tubing from the
pump temporarily past each tube through
the motherboard tray and then reconnect
it which should give enough slack it
worked and I was able to top off the few
drops that leaked out while I had the
tubes opened up with the fill port on
the side of the pump there's no way this
would've worked without the removable
fittings on the Kelvin s 36 and although
one of my reconnects did pop out and I
had to kind of scramble to mop up the
juice that leaked I was able to reattach
it and got through the rest of the CPU
cooler installation without any issues
cable management was a little tricky
since this is a very open design but I
used some velcro straps to keep most
everything tied up just beneath the
motherboard with the build all finished
Windows 10 installation proceeded and I
kept a close eye out for leaks
thankfully none so far as for CPU temps
check out my 69 50 X benchmarks video
which is linked again in the card in the
top right and you will find that with a
4.3 gigahertz overclock I was hitting a
DC on the CPU with air cooling but now
with water and topped out at 60
