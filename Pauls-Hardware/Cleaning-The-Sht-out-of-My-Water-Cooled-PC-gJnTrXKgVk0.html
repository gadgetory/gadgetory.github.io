hey guys welcome to today's video i'm
gonna start off by getting some
toothpaste - it's based must find his
based toothpaste huh should I get a 2
pack probably ok with just one I can't
decide between radiant mints and Arctic
fresh gotta go 30 fresh I did find this
I'm trying to replace the cleaning
supplies I might use for this project
and not have to use stuff that I might
actually also use on dishes at home
mission accomplished
yay target all right so we got all the
stuff here I'm gonna go over that in
just a second but more to the point
what's this video about if you guys saw
me taking all my computers apart you
probably saw me disassembling Arctic
Panther which I built originally about
three years ago and then I rebuilt again
about eight months ago and now I am
cleaning the residue that has built up
from the liquid that I was using in the
loop which was primo chill view fluid
which looks really cool but as Jay found
and I have now found if you're using it
long term especially if you're using the
early stuff some of the original stuff
they sent out you're gonna get some
buildup in some gunk in the block so we
got to clean that stuff out and that is
why I needed to paste of course among a
few other things here so the toothpaste
first and foremost is specifically
recommended by Jay I went with Arctic
fresh because Arctic Panther that makes
sense and it says some whitening in it
and Jay just found that specifically
with the pretty much Hillview buildup
that he had in there cleaning the blocks
themselves this actually did a really
good job getting the gunk out of there
as well as cleaning off the residue that
might even be left over I grabbed a few
other things some bristle brushes here
to clean out where residue might be
built up and I don't have to use
anything that we currently use for
dishes or like stuff that we eat out of
trying to keep that separate along the
same lines there I got a glass measuring
container here and that is so I can use
the Mayhem's
kit I also grabbed a couple of these
with just a little two dollar bins these
are just so I can use them as temporary
reservoirs for liquid as I'm setting up
a loop to cycle through the mayhem
splits kit speaking of that is right
here it's cleaning kits uses detergents
and this is going to take like 12 hours
to actually cycle through so I'm going
to set up all the cleaning today and
then I'm going to come back with a part
3 video where I actually have the cleans
products and I reinstall everything in
arctic Panther and chances are I'm also
going to be redoing at least a few of
these bends if not all of them here's
the majority of the water clean stuff
that I've removed and that still needs
to be rinsed off a little bit and then
the parts that I need to clean out today
are going to be the pump and reservoir
combo and I'm going to set this up with
the Mayhem's cleaning kit to cycle
through both of these two radiators have
a 240 millimeter and a turret in the 60
millimeter radiator and inside of these
radiators there's definitely more
residue built up and I want to make sure
I can clean that all out so that when I
actually refill this with just water
because that's what I'm going to do from
now and it's just water so I can use it
long term I will get no discoloration or
little bits of stuff floating through
the loop which is probably gonna happen
anyway but I'll do my best to eliminate
that apart from the cleaning loop to be
set up there I'm going to be
disassembling my blocks the to GPU
blocks as well as the mono block for the
CPU and power delivery and I'll be
giving both of those a good scrub out
once again with the crest 3d white
toothpaste that Jay recommended now the
only part says really missing in order
to accomplish all of these tasks is
going to be some fittings for my tubing
that I have back there because I need to
do some external loops in and out of
stuff so I can cycle fluid through and
for that I sent Joe on a mission to
Micro Center this morning and there is
good job Joe what's in the bag first a
swift tech MCP 35 X pump this is just an
external pump with Gino quarter fittings
that I can use whenever I need a pump
and I'm never going to actually install
this in a system it's just gonna be my
pump to use 182 pump and lastly and
perhaps most importantly is gonna be the
actual fittings since I have lots of
hard line fittings here but no soft
tubing fittings I had Joe grab a set of
these he was supposed to get eight he
brought seven it's okay I'm not gonna
blame him for that but these will allow
me to get some easier to work with loops
set up externally with my existing primo
chilled flux tube
which is 3/8 inch inner diameter and
half inch outer diameter and the
monoblock is now disassembled we can see
the interior parts where there is oh my
gosh so much buildup in here that's
pretty nasty especially right over here
where the jet plate is like that's
really clogged in there so I hope the I
hope the toothpaste can do a good job
here to clean that stuff out for
anything else we're gonna give these a
quick rinse the o-rings here the gasket
very important I don't think there was
one right they this is a different size
right there doesn't need to be one there
does there
so aside from like doing in small favors
like picking up foodies and crafts or
pas another day through the garbage
disposal for example ring is entirely
Joe's own decision to do
I didn't order him to do this I didn't
threaten that he would be fired and
never edit videos for me ever again he
just shoved his hand at my garbage
disposal trying to get employee of the
month and I got it
damn Joe Wow
alright so Joe this is the Employee of
the Month you fished out the o-ring
hitch well well done Joe thank you
so the top of the monoblock here seems
to be doing pretty good that doesn't
seem to have a whole lot of residue
built up on top of it or anything but I
did decide that I wanted to pull the
gasket out the o-ring and just give it a
wipe down to make sure anything that had
built up on that was cleaned off and
also went through the old channel here
around the outside this thing's looking
well I'm not quite new but definitely a
lot fresher than it was
GPU block number one has been
disassembled we can again see plenty of
residue up in there it's not gonna look
quite as nasty it's the cpu block in
here I don't think what we can still see
a very similar pattern here of a residue
that has actually built up underneath
the old jet plate here and of course
anything like that that's impeding the
flow of the liquid across those
particular fins in general is a big
no-no so I'm gonna clean that out the
same way we did the cpu block
is the terminals for the end of the GPUs
and they are pretty caked up with
residue so I'm going to clean these out
- also going to remove these little oval
rings so I can clean out the gunk
underneath those that's not to use a
knife or something really sharp for the
type of thing because you really don't
want to cut the o-ring but don't worry
as many of you have noted my knife here
is not sharp at all
the reason flexible tubing with fittings
is very useful for something like this
is anytime you need to flush your
radiator get water in and out of
something components just having the
flexible tubing is a lot more flexible
for that now let's move on to the
mayhans blitz cleaning kit contains a
warning right off the bat contains
phosphoric acid that can burn your skin
and irritants so there's gloves and
safety goggles right there so other than
the gloves and the safety goggles this
is what's included in the kit this is
part one the cleaner this is part two
which you use to flush it afterwards
they've got a measuring cup here so you
can measure the proper amounts of that
that you mix with water it's got a pH
testing kit that you can use afterwards
to measure the pH levels in your loop
and make sure nothing has gone
incredibly awry and just to reiterate
there is a detergent that's used in here
so you really do want to use the gloves
and safety goggles while you're using
this safety first
this is the outfit that you should wear
if you're doing this type of work you
actually look like communion and so
based on the mayhem the split skit
description in here as well as what I
actually experienced when I was flushing
these out the part one is for removing
rust and scale and balancing out the pH
levels and actually didn't have a lot of
stuff coming out of these when I was
doing it part two is an actual flush so
I'm going to go with part two treatment
for now and you can use this multiple
times since there's enough in there to
do multiple dilution so I can come back
and do that part one if it's still
necessary
so here's our blitz kit - loop power
supply over here to power the pump pump
is going to be with the reservoir full
of the blitz kit - stuff which is going
to go in there in just the second outlet
goes over here and - radiator one out of
that and into radiator two out of that
and then back into the reservoir
they don't accidentally deal okay to the
water that's supposedly suggests you to
wear protective gear and stuff but it's
alright just so frightful cleaning
meetings
think I can Satan it down the middle fix
it
well guys back at the beginning of this
video I think there was one key
ingredient to this whole project that I
did not list off and include and that is
patience that's right because this
Mayhem's blitz kit to a solution that
we're cycling through our pretty much
our whole loop here needs to cycle
through there for about 12 hours
actually 12 to 24 hours and as mentioned
there is a blitz kit one as well that I
decided not to do simply because the
radiators were flushing out fairly well
with just the plain water we have gotten
a lot done today though I got the blocks
completely cleaned out and that was a
lot of work but they actually cleaned up
pretty nicely just a little bit of
discoloration in there where the nickel
plated copper was actually getting a lot
of liquid flowing over it but that's
pretty normal for blocks that have been
youth in use for a little while so I'm
gonna let this run for about the next 12
to 24 hours so I'll probably cut it off
sometime tomorrow and then I have a
bunch of stuff planned this weekend but
then it's Friday right now Joe's coming
back on Monday and we're going to finish
this off and we're gonna put everything
back in and I'm gonna read then the
tubes and we're gonna get arctic panther
back up and running so thank you guys so
much for joining me for this video this
has been I guess part 2 of Arctic
Panthers rehabilitation one more time so
thanks for watching and I'll put some
links to the stuff I've used today down
in this video's description of course
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
