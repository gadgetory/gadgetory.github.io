hardware I am doing my monthly builds
video as I have been doing every month
or almost every month for the past few
months so basically how this works is at
the beginning of each month or near the
beginning of each month I do a couple
builds I assemble these builds using PC
part picker and I get all the parts
picked out for you guys and then I share
them with you and I kind of talk about
my thought process as I went through -
to make the builds as well as hopefully
getting the build scam has kind of
specified and narrowed down to a really
specific type of build that you guys
choose because there's some fan
interaction going on here as well now
sometimes I actually also build the
builds that I talk about later on and I
did do that recently with for example
the entry-level x99 build which you can
kind of see me assembling here this is
over on my channel of course my youtube
channel is pulsar berry you're probably
watching this on my You Tube channel but
I'm also doing this live so the
entry-level x99 build actually assembled
the blue build with the BitFenix Aegis I
also did a couple like a month or two
back so these are all lots of fun and I
like to assemble them as well because
that way it's not just like hey here's a
bunch of lists of parts I'm not gonna be
building the builds for this month just
give to you guys that information right
off the bat up front the upcoming build
that I am gonna be doing which I haven't
done yet is my August builds that's the
2,000 dollar gaming beast and that is
coming very soon so subscribe to my
channel and like this video if you liked
watching builds and that's probably be
up in the next week or so so today by
popular demand I'm doing a couple pretty
high end builds so if you're looking for
budgets sorry look at some of my older
ones or I'm gonna be doing weren't doing
more budget stuff next month so for this
month based on your guys's response and
reaction last month results so here's
here's the results for the September for
the builds you guys voted on last month
which is what you wanted to see me do
for September we have to at the top the
mini ITX overkill system so mini ITX
overkill we're gonna try to pack as much
as I can as possible into a mini ITX
build and also have the 4k gaming system
for $4,000 this includes an entire setup
so it's not just the base system which I
usually do and that one was actually lot
of fun actually both of these were a lot
of fun I put these together mostly
yesterday
it took me longer than I thought because
there were some there were some issues I
had to kinda
workaround with both of these but let's
just let's just get right into it and
start off with the Mini ITX overkill
system and of course I'm using a PC part
picker to assemble these builds that's a
great website because it compares prices
across lots of different areas and you
can sort of get an initial look here at
what I put in it but the total cost of
this build which I wasn't I didn't have
a price point here but it ended up being
about two thousand six hundred and
thirty dollars altogether with
everything that I picked
now it being a mini ITX system meant
that I needed to start with a mini ITX
board and if you ask me
mini ITX and overkill and you put those
words together I get this this is the
Azeroth hex 99e ITX / AC motherboard and
it's to me is just the definition of I
overkill in Mini ITX because it's it's
x99 socket LGA 2011 - v3 in a mini ITX
board it's really the only mini ITX
board that is sockets LGA 2011 and they
even used a narrower actual socket on
the CPU itself here so it's not exactly
a standard type that's why this board
actually ships with the CPU cooler but I
didn't want to use the CPU cooler that
comes with it I wanted something better
more than more on that in just a moment
so starting with the motherboard
knowing I wanted to go haswell-e with
this because that's like overkill next
up I wanted to choose the case and
here's where I'll probably get lots of
feedback from you guys which is like
what case I should have chosen now the
thing for me with Mini ITX is I want
Mini ITX to actually be small and you
find mini ITX cases out there that are
actually fairly large and so the the
graphite series 380 T from Corsair I
like because it's actually pretty small
it's got a handle on the top so like
small portable we can pick it up and
carry it around there's like the jury's
out on the actual design of this thing
and how much people like it and stuff
like that I think it looks pretty cool
but and you know there's definitely
people who are not as into what it looks
like so that being said it's also got
tons of ventilation on the top and sides
which I thought was important because
I'm squeezing a lot of hardware into
here and that's pretty much where I
started off with was with the
motherboard and the case so to go along
with the motherboard I chose 5820k cpu
intel core i7 didn't want to go with the
Xeon with this because
I already did it he's wedged look what
the 18 core Xeon or something into this
so I'm gonna not quite as crazy overkill
as that cuz then you gotta go Xeon and
that kind of thing so I thought it 58 20
kid work this made sense to me for a
mini ITX x99 build because you don't
have a bunch of PCI Express slots and
you only have what 28 lanes on the 5820k
so even if you went from a 5820k f to a
59 30k it's been an extra couple you
know 150 $200 you're not gonna be able
to use the extra lanes you get because
you don't have slots to slot them into
so I think 28 lanes is cool and then the
next option beyond that is going all the
way up to 59 and 60 X which you do get
an eight-core for that much money but
it's 650 bucks more so if you really
want to go all overkill do that or use
the 18 core Xeon that Linus used now
what I actually ran into a dilemma with
this build with was um choosing the CPU
cooler and I did some research on
several forums online this is a hard
forum thread specifically about this
motherboard and what CPU coolers you can
use with it because it's got that weird
mounting system that's actually meant
for servers like this so I'll post this
link in the video description once I put
it up this is a screen cap they posted
I'm here from Linus's build which is
that the motherboard actually comes with
a bracket a special mounting bracket
that you can use in order to put on
specifically the cooler master side on I
believe cooler that can fit in there but
several people have used it and sort of
jury-rigged it to line up with some
other different types of coolers so
that's gonna be my suggestion
the one I actually put in the build
itself is what did I actually go with
the cooler master Neptune 240 M which
also isn't one that it's like you'll
notice there's potential issues are
incompatibilities at the top of this
build and that's specifically because of
the the cooler the motherboard and the
chassis but going back over here to the
actual one right side shows a depth into
40 M because I found at least one dude
who was like yeah they'll work with this
you just have to kind of bend the
bracket a little bit there you go
the other options that are out there
might be the hydro Series the H 100 i
from Corsair is probably like the one
you want to go with something in my eye
the H 100 eye is what you want to go
with but it's discontinued and if you
this price on nua gets 150 bucks right
now which is insanely overpriced so
since they discontinued it like they're
all overpriced now so give it to 40
m-maybe instead you can also get the H
100 GTX and that one I am told at least
according to several the threads I read
that you can actually go to a spec and a
stack has a bracket you can get that
worked with the newer cooler design from
the GTX version and then you should
hopefully be okay but honestly finding a
CPU cooler that was big because I wanted
a 240 that was not too wide for the
cases because the 3d T has a very
limited amount of space available there
for the the radiator and the fans and
also that had the mounts that would fit
on this bracket was a bit of a challenge
I did actually pretty decent amount of
like looking up online of everything so
either go the height either go with the
H 100 I if you can find it for cheap GTX
if you're willing to contact ace tech to
get the ilm retention kit which costs
about $10 and that will work with the
newer kind of rounder pumps that the GTX
version has and then you should be able
to move on from there with that
hopefully minor issue out of the way we
can move on to memory got a Corsair
Vengeance lpx 32 gig kit thankfully you
can actually get ddr4 dual channel kits
now thanks to skylake launching so this
is 32 gigs 2 by 16 so even though you've
only got two DIMM slots you can still
run a dual channel and have plenty of
memory in there going with the overkill
theme I thought 32 gigs of memory would
would be suitable we also have a storage
right and I went kind of kind of crazy
with my storage I spent 750 bucks on
just a storage in this for 1.5 terabytes
of SSD storage so yes starting with the
HyperX predator from kingston i chose
this one because it's very fast it's
MDOT - its PCI Express not SATA or a HDI
connection so it's gonna be really fast
if you want a cheaper option for this go
for the samsung XP 941 you can get the
512 gig of that which is a little bit
more storage than this it is a little
bit slower than the predator but it's
about 100 to 120 dollars cheaper it's
also got a green PCB and not the black
PCB like the predator has so you know
bear that in mind as well this case does
or the system does also have a color
theme it's black black white and blue
kind of goes along with the case and
hello it's anyone who is joined up in
chat thanks to all of you guys for
hopping in here
to round out the storage I got a one
terabyte SSD because I wanted a one
terabyte SSD and I'm tired of loading up
games off of mechanical drives so you
get the predator for like your operating
system and some games you got a one
terabyte crucial bx 100 actually
available on mac mall crazily enough
over here and that will give you some
massive storage and that will load up
all your games really fast and that hey
that says overkill mini ITX to me video
card i thought was going to be an
interesting choice for this system and
as the r9 nano just the fury nano from
AMD just came out I bet a lot of you
expecting me to throw that in here I
said no I said no to the Nano for this
build because this is an overkill build
and the Nano honestly I see what they
did with it but they they they brought
down its actual performance to me and
the thing I was looking at when I was
considering the Nano and looking at this
system and looking at the ITX cases that
are out there was like most of the ITX
cases actually can't support pretty long
graphics cards like the length this way
which is kind of where you get the
shortness of the nano with the graphics
card is is not always a limiting factor
and in fact the 3d tee from Corsair can
handle up to 290 mm meter long graphics
cards so it can handle pretty long
graphics cards so I went with the island
with the 980ti over the nano on this one
I didn't want to do a fury X but if
you're into the fury X wait till my next
build the 980ti is going to be faster
than a nano it's just it's just gonna
and since I didn't need the space I was
like are at 980 I this one from gigabyte
I thought would fit in really well
because it's got their really nice wind
force cooler triple fans it is black and
it even has a blue LED on it so it's
gonna match in with the rest of the
color scheme of the case and it's gonna
be flat out faster than a nano or a fury
X generally speaking for that matter as
well and of course it fits within the
290 millimeter length since this one is
I believe 280 millimeters long okay
the power supplies last apart from this
build and for this one I just went with
the BitFenix fury 650 watt I'm sorry
there's not better pictures of this I've
actually used this I used this same one
in the blue build that I did it's black
white and blue and it's got nicely
sleeved cabling and for you can get a
cheaper 650 watt 80 plus gold power
supply
this by 10 20 bucks maybe but you can
actually get this for not too expensive
right now 86 87 dollars at super bees
and it's got really really nice loop
cable so that's kind of why I went with
that one it's got the full package
alright and that is my overkill mini ITX
gaming build it's pretty overkill yeah
looking you can fit a lot of stuff in
that little case and I think it's fun if
any of you actually build that let me
know because I've actually I kind of
wanted to build both of these systems
but I got to cut myself off sometime
alright moving right along to the 4k
gaming setup for $4,000 4k for 4k can
you do it and since you can that's
already been kind of established for
less than $4,000 I made this an actual
not just a build as far as the case goes
but an actual entire gaming setup for
$4,000 so that means not just the core
system it also means a monitor and it
also means peripherals keyboard mouse
and I did a headset I could have done
speakers too but I didn't
here's the full builds as you can see
the price down here at the bottom comes
in it well just over $4,000 but you got
to pay for shipping four thousand twelve
dollars was what this rounded out too
and this is an absolutely beastly system
this one is also based on that x99
socket 2011 because that's kind of the
top end and both of these were pretty
pretty high-end expensive systems but
for this one since it was 4k for 4k I
actually started out in a different
place than I normally would and that was
that I needed a 4k monitor and honestly
if I was gonna buy a 4k monitor right
now this is probably the one I would buy
this is the wasabi mango if you guys are
interested in a little bit more in-depth
info on this one check out PC
perspective as well as Tek syndicate
hardware channels both have overviews on
this monitor Wendell did a great job
looking at his I went for the $700
version which is not perfect pixel jeon
perfect pixel it's about 800 bucks at
least if you buy it here on eBay
these are also available on Amazon and
they have just a pretty insane set of
features for what you want right now you
get 4k of course you need that
resolution if you're running it at 1080
though you can actually overclock the it
as well so you can run it at 120 Hertz
so if you're into the high frame rate
thing you can also get a hundred and
twenty Hertz support it has free sinks
porch that tied into my choice of
graphics cards which I'll share with you
in just a moment it's also got hdmi 2.0
even though my graphics cards don't it's
okay though because it also has
DisplayPort but hdmi 2.0 I think is
pretty important if you're actually
investing in a 4k monitor right now 4
for 4 chroma setup you can do you can do
10 bit color the one negative about the
wasabi mango is the response time isn't
quite as good as some of the faster TN
panels that are out there so if you
really really into fast response time
then you might want to look elsewhere
but everything else about this monitor
and 42 inches at that did I mention it's
a 42 inch yeah you put this on your desk
and you'll be in just gaming lists for
the rest of your life alright so that's
700 bucks off of the top $4,000 price of
this build so everything else had to fit
within the envelope below that and that
gives us 20 no 3,300 dollars to work
with and we should be able to get a nice
4k system going for that so let's go
back to the oops let's go back to the
whole list here we consider the sabe
mango here I actually had to punch that
in because it's not on PC park picker as
of now but maybe it will be soon let's
go with sort of the other parts of this
so beyond the monitor I thought the
graphics cards were gonna be the most
important thing to consider next up so I
went with dual fury X's that's right
dual fury X's why why did I do this
well my AMD fans out there like yeah
dual fury X it's badass and I would
agree with them especially when tested
at 4k the for your e^x is does an
exceedingly good job even though it's
only got 4 gigs of memory it's that
super fancy new HBM memory and I think
this is a great option if you're going
for a 4k setup right now and you're
spending a bit more money yeah the other
nice things about this that's got it
it's got the built-in water cooling so
everything's gonna be water-cooled on
this system out of the box these
actually these cards actually do better
at 4k I already kind of mentioned that
and the monitor I just showed you has
free sync support free sync which means
you can use the free sync with the fury
X's now there are of course gonna be
some potential hiccups when it comes to
free sync crossfire support and 4k
resolution we anticipate that as long as
you have the hardware that's compatible
these hiccups will be worked out via
driver support and updates in the future
so yeah just barring that all in mind a
4k monitor with the with the with the
2-way fury X setup I think you're going
pretty happy with even if you can't
always make it take advantage of
crossfire configuration and Hecht just
turn free sync off if that's your thing
if you don't want three exes or if you
will have a g-sync monitor or something
like that then feel free to get two-way
980 T is Titan X's we're also high in
the running in my choice for this one
but that would have been 2 grams right
out of the gate and I mean you do get 12
gigs of memory for that so that's hard
it's hard trace but for this one with
the fury axes okay the CPU of course I
stuck with haswell-e because in my
opinion if you're building in a system
that's this expensive you should go with
haswell-e so I need a nice motherboard
for that the motherboard I chose was
this somewhat new one from MSI this is
the x99 Raider it's got eight DIMM slots
it's got a pretty much all black design
which is pretty cool now it's got plenty
of room there with triple slot spacing
for my two-way configuration you got em
got to support and all that kind of
stuff
this also isn't terribly expensive comes
in at about 220 dollars as of the
pricing on new egg right now did I
mention my CPU I don't think I did I
think I totally blanked on the CPU CPU
is right here that's a 59 30 K again
here trying to stay within that $4,000
envelope if you're really going for top
and top men go with the 59 60 X but I
thought a 49 30 K was more appropriate
here because you do have more PCIe lanes
and since you're running a dual channel
or a two way crossfire setup then you're
gonna want your gonna want all the
bandwidth you can get just to be on the
safe side okay moving along to memory I
went with the 32 gig kit
$4,000 ish budget about 32 gigs is
appropriate you could shave 180 to $100
off the price of this build by going
with a 16 gig kit but this is a HyperX
fury they're all nice black memories
black PCBs they look pretty nice too
pretty low profile this is only a 2133
kit but that'll do fine for you that's
not gonna affect your gaming since
you're not running an eye GPU off of it
or anything like that and that'll get
you set up with the quad channel know
what the same cooler on this build
cooler master Neptune 240m it's kind of
like because I have some other cooler
master parts in this and actually chose
this cooler before I went back to the
the Mini ITX build and I decided maybe I
should relook at that cooler to make
sure the compatibility wasn't gonna be a
problem
I've used this cooler it's got a nice
quiet pump does a great job a little
over a hundred bucks the case I went
with this a mastercase pro 5 this is for
coolermaster I did a video on this
recently so I had actually worked with
it which means I I liked it it really
really solid build quality this seems to
me like a case that'll last you quite
some time the pro 5 version has your
radiator bracket up at the top which is
important since we're using a radiator
this also comes with a side window so
you can get a nice look at everything
inside and it also has more Drive cages
not that we'll need all of those but
we've only at least space for the power
supply I went with this EVGA power
supply this is I don't even know what
the mom they don't they're not good with
their models it's the 1000 G power
supplied from EVGA look at those cables
they're all black this is my
requirements for this I wanted a
thousand watts
I wanted all black cabling I wanted 80
plus gold or 80 plus platinum and this
one kind of mat matches all that for
about 140 bucks after a meal and rebate
coolermaster also has a power supply
that's a thousand watts and I forget the
oh gosh I forget the model of it now I
was gonna look at that one but it was it
was like twenty or thirty bucks more and
I really I was trying to standard that
$4,000 price limit okay next up we have
storage and for storage here I didn't go
too crazy I went with the one terabyte
SSD because I like one terabyte SSDs
this is a little bit you can you can get
by with less than this for sure but 320
bucks for one terabyte SSD in a SanDisk
Ultra - which is a very good SSD SanDisk
does a good job with their controllers
their NAND as well as overall
construction it says good read and write
speeds a freaking terabyte SSD that's
that's all you need and then I also
wanted to add some mass storage so this
is that hitachi drive that we've talked
about a few times
this is one of Backblaze tested and this
was one of their consumer drives that
they found to have the most longevity
and lifespan so we've had several people
asked me about it since we did that
video and say hey we're and we can
refine that it's been available for like
50 ish dollars before but I think the
price has gone up a little bit ever
since that Backblaze report but still 65
bucks 2 terabytes mass storage should be
nice and reliable for you and it gives
you something to back up that's a 1
terabyte SSD with now we have
peripherals as well because this is a
whole build so I'm sticking with the
coolermaster theme I got the quick-fire
TK I figured that a a mechanical
keyboard would be suitable for this
since again it is a four thousand dollar
budget
looking for a higher end a mechanical
keyboard I think is one of those luxury
items that goes along with it then this
is a full-size mechanical keyboard for
84 bucks from Coolermaster these have
really got good good build quality
Cherry MX red switches and it's black
and red and I haven't mentioned this yet
but this whole system if you put it
together will pretty much all be black
and red see I got the color scheme taken
care of to put some thought into these
alright for the mouse such as the Mannix
naos now is night nail I never know how
to pronounce this this is a 7000 I just
chose this mouse because it's one of my
personal favorites as far as a
ergonomics and comfort go you can feel
free to choose your own mouse if you
don't like this one but I really like I
did this is just what I've used and I
enjoy 70 bucks a nice high-quality Mouse
for not like a hundred or 100 or more
than 100 I was going to say the rocket
myth might be another option but I'm
it's like 120 right now so uh okay also
what with the optical version for that
since people were hating on the laser
version that I used last time lastly we
have a headset and if I was gonna say
buy a headset right now this is one I
would say to buy HyperX cloud gaming
headset it's just actually good even
though it's a gaming headset and it's
got you set up with a nice mic good
sound
altogether and that is the entire build
right I think I went over everything
there did I forget anything let's double
check
let's double check one more time looks
look at the full list 59 30 kept in 240m
x9m raider HyperX fury black 32 gig kit
SanDisk Ultra 960 gig plus the Hitachi
Deathstar 2 terabyte 2-way crossfire
fury X's Coolermaster mastercase pro 5
EVGA thousand watt power supply that
wasabi mango 42 inch 4k monitor
Coolermaster CM storm quickfire TK
gaming keyboard my onyx Nass 7000 wired
optical mouse and the kingston hyperx
prep cloud Pro headset all for 4 grand
so everyone hit up your parental units
or take out a loan or do whatever the
heck you need to get gift pork ran
together to put together this system I I
like getting this all together it's like
this like not only did it feel right
after getting that all in there but I
was also I even got to the point even
with the four thousand dollar budget
where I was like nickel and dime and
twenty eight thirty forty dollar price
differences just to get everything kind
of within that envelope so I'm happy
with how it turned out but guys that is
all for this video
and and what else do I say at the end
you should stay tuned because as
previously mentioned I do have an August
build that I have yet to be put together
which I'm gonna do within the next week
so subscribe to my channel for that and
maybe hit the like button if you enjoyed
it and you want to see more builds next
month's builds though are also coming up
very soon and you should also vote for
those now since I went with higher-end
builds for this month for next month
October builds I went budget side so
really I'm focusing mainly on the price
point here but I have a thousand dollar
video editing system seven hundred
dollar gaming system $450 console
replacement or her $300 web and email
mom and pop system next month I'm gonna
do my best to get this parts together to
actually build one of those as well so
stay tuned for that also don't forget to
check out my store which is stored at
pulsar bar debt net where you can buy
shirts like this one I also have mugs
and glasses if you're interested in
drinking liquid items out of those don't
