guys welcome back to Pauls hardware this
is probing Paul episode number 25 a
monthly Q&amp;amp;A video that I do just about
every month and if you're thinking I've
done one somewhat recently in May you're
probably right
but I'm doing another one so deal with
it since I do this every month there is
a whole long history so feel free to
check out the playlist if you want to
look at old questions that I have
answered in the past which are probably
still very relevant and of course all
the questions that I'm answering today
have been asked by you guys in the
comments section from the last video so
it's a it's a vicious cycle that will
never never truly end let's get right to
the first question though from door
first 777 he has an Asus x99 motherboard
he's wondering if he's going to get
better performance from the onboard MDOT
2 slot versus using a PCI Express
adapter now your motherboard does need
to have support for nvme I'm assuming
you're talking about an nvme SSD and
really all you're talking about here is
an adapter that's taking a PCI Express
signal and adapting it to a different
actual connector if you're using just a
basic single slot PCI Express MDOT to an
adapter you shouldn't see any
performance difference between using
that connecting directly to an MDOT 2
slot on the motherboard or even like a
u2 u dot to porch they didn't really
take off but it's also the same
connection standard just a different
physical type of plug so don't worry
about it as long as you got PCI Express
nvme SSD that's by 2 or by 4 as long as
you're giving it by 2 or by 4 bandwidth
so you have your expansion card plugged
into the right slot on your motherboard
and of course your motherboard supports
MB nvme you should be just fine so don't
worry about losing any performance next
questions from Z Kensie
and this is this is a triple question
I'm actually gonna answer all three of
these I'll try to do it quickly first
how to prevent GPU sag
very good question lots of people ask
about this so especially if you have a
massive graphics card like this or it's
10 atti with three fans and a big old
cooling solution lots of way down there
so you might get some sag when it's
actually installed and we complain about
this when we do put my PC on awesome
hardware pretty frequently I have three
possible solutions for you first one is
free your PCI Express power cables if
outed upwards if you have a slots or
pass-through on your motherboard tray
that you can pass them through you can
do that and kind of put some some
tension on them tie them back behind the
tray and that can actually pull the GPU
up a little bit and prevent GPU sag it's
not as precise and it depends on the
case of course so I got a couple more
options for you guys - if you want to
spend some money check out mmm NPC Tech
Bill Owens site and he does a bunch of
custom products like braces and these
are a little bit on the more expensive
side this is 50 bucks but it's custom
designed he's got different ones that
are made for different graphics cards it
actually sits in the slot below your
graphics card it's just a big metal
piece that is actually machined and
looks pretty cool and provides that
support that you need to prevent that
GPU sag Final Solution and this one
maybe is also a little bit on the
cheaper side but I like something like
this this is actually from the PC
master-race
subreddit but he has used just a little
toy something in there that you know
provides a little bit of of character
for your computer and he's just sitting
under there holding up the graphics card
so you can do something like that that's
sort of an in-between method just to
give some support beneath it I mean you
could even go so far as like to cut a
wood dowel or something like that just
to put in there and put in place just
make sure you're you're making an
aesthetic decision to make your computer
look better so make sure whatever you do
put in there has sort of a clean finish
to it because otherwise you might as
well just stick with the SAG two more
questions and to answer these I'm gonna
direct you over to an article and a
video first question is what a GPU
extender riser cable should he use for
his vertical GPU mat and then followup
should he even bother going with the
vertical GP Emmett I will direct you to
this video cards dot-com article where
they actually tested a bunch of
different GPU riser cables the short
answer is you want to go with the higher
quality ones they cost a little bit more
but the power delivery is actually where
these tend to suffer I mean if you don't
have proper power delivery for a
graphics card a lot of these are made
for like mining operations which don't
really require that much power but I'll
link this article in the video's
description so check it out if you want
up on that sand there's also some
suggested ones that you can order down
there finally should you actually bother
with a vertical GPU bracket and I will
direct you over to Dimitri's video on
harbor connects for that he did some
testing with this it's gonna depend on
your case and how much space you
actually have between the graphics card
and the side of your case but in his
testing he found that it wasn't the best
idea if all you're concerned about is
performance having the GPU right up
against the case side panel restricts
airflow going into the GPU cooling
solution leads to higher temperatures
and with modern graphics cards that
means your GPU is going to throttle
itself just a little bit so you can
still do it just fine it's not going to
make your system not work but you are
probably going to be giving up a little
bit of performance unless you
specifically find a case that has one of
those side mounts that has enough space
there to provide airflow and you
probably have to find some specific
testing for that in order to make sure
it works
next question from alexander lennon hey
Paul what kind of mouse are using it
looks like a great fit for me I'm not
exactly sure which Mouse you're asking
about Alexander but I actually have a
couple here that I've been using
recently I'm guessing you're talking
about this one because this is my main
set and this is one it's been plugged in
here for a while this is a from
Coolermaster it's the master mouse mm
530 its RGB it's got a few profiles it's
got side buttons for forward them back
I've actually been liking sort of the
less expensive mice recently so this
one's only 32 bucks if you buy it on
Amazon I'll put a link in the
description it's it's an affiliate link
FYI so if you click it it helps me out
and thank you for doing that yeah for 32
bucks this has been a solid Mouse I just
like the tracking on it it's got four
different dpi settings that you can do
it's got a pic start pmw 30 360 infrared
sensor which has been tracking pretty
nicely for me so there it is link in the
description I've also been using from
time to time this mouse and this is the
master keys light L and I don't think
you can actually buy this by itself but
I imagine if you could it would be very
inexpensive I did find the combo you can
get the master keys like combo it
actually comes with a mechanical switch
keyboard with RGB backlighting for 52
ish dollars and this little mouse which
I've also been using just with some test
setups and that kind of thing and
there's also doing it's like just fine
it's a good little mouse
like forward and back buttons tracking
is good and of course RGB if you want it
to be a little bleah
Alberto aspires to asks hey Paul what's
the difference between 1080 and 1440
when building a PC I like this question
because it's big enough that I can sort
of interpret it myself and make up my
own answer and so you're probably
talking about resolution 1920 by 1080
versus 2560 by 1440 if we're strictly
sticking with 16 by 9 aspect ratios the
difference right now is that 1080 is
kind of the standard you can get a very
inexpensive 1080 monitor for around $100
and you can start gaming the upgrade to
1440 will require more GPU horsepower
the monitors are going to probably cost
a little bit more and you also might
consider when you're upgrading to higher
level monitors getting something that
supports g-sync if you have an Nvidia
graphics card or freesync
if you're lucky enough to have an AMD
graphics card that you were able to
somehow purchase for not incredibly high
prices so for me right now the
difference is going to be spending two
hundred fifty eight dollars on a
graphics card that will be just fine for
1080 and maybe allow you to play at 1440
in some situations in some games and
spending more like 400 to 500 dollars on
a graphics card which is what you'd have
to spend for a 1070 1070 TI or gtx 1080
and that would handle playing at 1440
much better there are other variables at
play of course but just trying to keep
things quick and simple 1440 is like
taking a step away from what most people
are playing at when they're talking
about console or PC gaming and sort of
ascending into the realm of like wow it
looks a lot better and cleaner and you
really start to appreciate it I like
1440 because it's a nice step up from
1080 without requiring as much GPU
horsepower as gaming at 4k
antwuan ashraf asks does Rison 2600
perform better with s with xf r 2 rather
than manual overclocking in gaming so
let's take a look at the horizon v 2600
over on Newegg it has a boost clock
boost frequency of 3.9 gigahertz and
depending on your temperature cooling
solution it might actually ramp up a
little bit more than that
that's how XFR works it's pretty
effective and I have found that unless
you have a really good cooling solution
and a really good chip for overclocking
that you can somehow set to run
at 4.1 4.2 gigahertz are higher on all
cores then you're probably better
sticking with the stock frequencies
because XFR can get a 2600 up to 4
gigahertz or a little bit higher and if
you're overclocking all cores you might
get stuck at three point eight or three
point nine since games do tend to prefer
single core performance a little bit
more when it comes to overall gaming
performance it's actually shown to
perform better with XFR - and again this
is situational then with just a manual
overclock so the manual overclock I
would go for if you really need more
overall CPU horsepower or if you're
trying to get the bang for your buck
option by buying a 2600 and overclocking
it versus spending a little bit more
money on a 2600 X I have three more
questions so let's do a speed round
mostly ap asks Paul your PC is running
24/7 or do you shut them off when you
finish a video I've been trying to shut
down computers I usually he'll shut down
a computer if I have that option but
that's part of the reason why I'm trying
to get the FreeNAS set up back up and
running with a new configuration is
because I want a system that's on all
the time that uses really low power but
they can handle stuff like having my
personal data that I can access over my
network and then also the capability of
running the Plex servers so that it can
actually use the TV tuner card that we
have on the network to actually capture
TV shows that we have scheduled to
record not that we have a lot of those
anymore but we have the TV tuner card
and everything so I like to keep that up
and running
Josh keys hey Josh yes how is our cue
Panther doing and any plans on upgrading
my wife's PC my OS PC is known as hotbox
and it's still up and running I need to
do a maintenance video on that one
because it's still using the opaque
Mayhem's fluid in it and I'm pretty sure
that needs a good flush so I probably
will do a video on that when I clean it
out and maybe an update on that actual
build itself as for arctic panther don't
feel in here in the background still
working just fine the Primeau chill view
fluid has pretty much turned completely
clear in that the pump is still working
the Primeau chill flow indicator has
stopped moving and that's still just
sitting there so I need to open that up
and do a drain as well and see what I
want to do with it
next so that's also coming in the future
we're probably not until I get back from
Computex and final question from Richard
ship how is the new truck running so if
you guys remember back late last year I
went and drove to Colorado
I got a Toyota Tacoma and I drove it
back here it's running great although I
do need to take it in for some
maintenance so I will hopefully get to
that very soon did get a wash just
recently so it's nice and shiny although
it only lasted about a week before it
got a bunch of water spots on it again I
do really like my new truck though and
it's been a lot of fun to drive around
it's four by four and it's manual and
it's fun and finally here is my peel box
guys if you are interested in sending me
anything you know legally of course then
feel free to send me stuff we usually
open packages that arrive to my peel box
and Kyle's peel box during awesome
hardware our live show on Tuesday
evenings at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
so just to throw that out here because
not everyone knows it's there it's you
in the description of all my videos too
but that pretty much wraps it up for
this video guys so thank you so much for
watching this episode of probing Paul
I'll be doing another Q&amp;amp;A video in about
a month so if you have any questions for
me post them in the comment section down
below also links to relevant stuff is in
the video's description so check down
there and click on those things and and
thank you for doing that thank you for
watching this video as well and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
