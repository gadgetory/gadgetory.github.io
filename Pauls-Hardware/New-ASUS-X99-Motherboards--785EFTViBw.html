Paul's hardware this is a special video
I got a guess here this is jayjay from
Asus you have probably seen him before I
have been working with him for many
years thank you for being here JJ thanks
for having me man of course we're here
to talk about new Asus x99 motherboards
there are actually five that we're going
to talk about today we have three of
them here to show you close up and
basically Intel has now launched
Broadwell II there's a new stack of CPUs
although CPU still use the LGA 2011 -
three socket and they will slot into
existing x99 motherboards correct but
the existing x99 motherboard is all suck
they're terrible no no that's not
exactly true but there are some subtle
differences from the old x99 boards to
the noon x99 boards and of course there
are these new ones from Asus which all
have sort of unique distinguishing
features and that kind of thing so
that's why JJ is here to give us all the
information on them and I'm I'm excited
are you guys excited definitely I'm
pretty I'm pretty excited alright so
let's start off before we even get into
the motherboards and let's talk a little
bit about Broadwell ii in general so we
have four new CPUs the only one I've
memorized so far as 6950 XO that is the
10 core 20 thread monster cpu it's also
fairly expensive but you know we'll
leave that to your decision whether or
not you think it's too expensive or not
and it will slide into any of these
boards and give you just a pretty
significant performance boost even if
you comparing it to like a 59 60 X
correct I mean you've got you know in
general all the things you would expect
you've got a huge increase in terms of
the cache got the IPC improvements and
then of course you have those additional
course and you've got you know of course
the ability to overclock it and you talk
about of course just a extremely beastly
CPU I mean you know not necessarily
going to be that target demographic in
terms of just building a great gaming
system but if you're really looking to
have that system that does everything
right you know contact creation advanced
productivity gave me whatever might be
you know this is going to be platform
for you so that CPU and indeed I think
any CPU and the haswell-e or Broadwell
arranged are aimed at enthusiasts or
people who are putting heavy workloads
on their systems you know if all you're
going to be doing is gaming then you're
probably okay with skylake err after
coming KB Lake but what we're talking
about here right now is systems that do
more than just gaming more than just web
browsing so
all of these are obviously geared
towards those people but even amongst
those people there of course some who
want more features or less features of
that kind of thing so let's get into
actually some of the features that you'd
say across the board for all these x99
new x99 boards as kind of an
unintentional fun neighborhood features
that that match up everywhere and I
think actually the first thing that
jumps into my mind is just the
aesthetics right yeah for sure I mean I
think our focus for this generation was
to make the best even better you know I
think we really say a great foundation
for x99 boards and we do a lot of really
cool stuff for that first generation of
x99 that was already the first white
boards that really consciously put out
the right motherboard vendor and we had
a lot of great response there's one
right there yeah and we can play that
through a course with the secondary
refresh for x99 as well as in z170 and
so we followed suit for these two new
boards here you've got the - a and the
deluxe they're both going to be followed
up by a - to designate essentially that
they're that new version of the board
that's too confusing to you it's looks
good I like it it's it's the most simple
like new version of a board ever just
make it - just make it - um and so I
think you know we even cleaned up the
shroud a little bit in terms of the
coloring so you've got the white with
just a little bit of silver and kind of
gray in terms of the contrast
monochromatic pretty much throughout the
board there's a little bit of light blue
exiting they're going to see on the
primary top of the various Sam and then
on the PCH but it's really subtle I
don't think it's going to conflict
against anything I think it's going to
look fantastic
we then jump over into the Strix board
though and this is a little bit
different I think it's going to look
very very similar to a lot of people
that love the look of the Maximus a
formula which is pretty much that kind
of complete blacked out board
monochromatic the big distinguishing
point in terms of color will of course
be the two zones that you have here in
terms of the the IO shroud and then here
in the PCH where you actually have
decals so while the prefix decals are in
orange you can entirely remove that and
go for a really just kind of blacked out
look which would fit and pretty much
just about any type of build or you
could use the decals that come included
with the board and you could change the
color out to pink you can change out the
grain you can change it out to white I'm
big fan I really like the white and but
so yeah you got pink in there I have the
Kyle have something to do that
definitely I think we looked a little
bits of his content great it's nice so
will you guys have reach to the other
other color decals that you could maybe
get as well I definitely say if you guys
have feedback on that drop it in the
comments section you know I think that's
one of the reasons why we went that
route is that it's an easy way to just
be able to add a little bit of contrast
color easily to the to the look and feel
on the board without adding a high
degree of cost and it's very easy for us
to kind of shift in different colors if
users are interested in this so if you
guys want to see different colors let us
know okay but speaking of colors I mean
RGB has really been kind of this this
onslaught of all types of RGB right it's
about the rewards graphics cards
peripherals all types of products and
we've let definitely that focus you know
we have the z170 ROG boards that had the
RGB header and then RGB lighting on the
boards and now for this generation we've
really taken it to the next level so all
of these boards are going to feature
multiple points of RGB lighting so if we
take a look there let's say that the the
- a we can see that we've got RGB
lighting
it'll be present here on the PCH we've
got RGB lighting for the PCIe slots and
then we also have RGB lighting for the
crystal sound 3.0 audio section of the
board so that's all fully controllable
you can go into the our software
customize it to your heart's content and
all the boards also have our RGB header
so that I think is a really awesome
addition and I like this is an
implementation for LEDs on a motherboard
we haven't seen before which is they're
actually sitting right beneath the
little clasp on the PCIe slot yet the
brand new clasp which is kind of it's
kind of a smoky clear yeah it's so much
nicer yeah it's very similar to the
actual bit housing that you're going to
have and when you take a look at like
the high-end mechanical keyboards and
where they allow for superior diffusion
and lighting so that's going to be
present so all these boards whether
you're talking about the Strix or the
blocks of the - they all feature these
multiple zones of lighting the Strix is
going to take it a little bit further
where it actually has RGB lighting built
in here - the IO shroud so there's a
strip that'll light up right here but
same thing PCI lighting and then also
here in the center of the board the
Republic of gamers that is full RGB it's
gotta light up the qiraji
and then for the deluxe you'll pretty
much have it where you just have the
shroud here on this board which also has
the custom Bible
customizable RGB lighting now one of the
things that kind of talk about the
general aesthetic and I think the
going to make a great foundation for
however you want to go whether it's you
know white black bills or however you
want to set the look and feel your
system is when talking about these PCIe
slots they look a little bit different
not just because of that retention
mechanism which is clear right but the
actual slot itself is something that
we've gone about and redesigned and I
think this is something that I know when
you kind of first look that you're like
they look a little bit different all
right they are I mean it's got it's got
metal reinforcement here and granted we
have seen that before on other competing
boards but Asus has done it special yes
for us you know we were trying to think
about how do we go about really
reinventing the PCIe slot so we went
ahead and developed an entirely
patent-pending process now for the vast
majority users realistically it's not
going to be something that they really
need to concern themselves with it a
board that doesn't have this or a slot
that doesn't have this as all sudden the
guard for graphics card is going to drop
off or anything like this it's really
going to be targeted for users that may
be helped there are very high end
graphics cards that are much larger you
know maybe something your Strix triple
fan card maybe older generational cards
that might be two and a half or three
slot cards or maybe you're moving your
system to like a land and something like
that or you've got complex water cooling
setups and you don't want it to make you
take out the cards and you have that
additional movement you just want to be
able to have additional torsion
resistance and security and you're
saying for system integrators as well
people who are building systems you know
for as a business and jump in are places
that's also a big thing that was
actually one of the probably the biggest
reasons why we went ahead and developed
this design is clothes combination with
leading partners you know whether you
talked about companies like Puget
systems Falcon Northwest digital storm a
lot of parties that we work with we were
going to get feedback on that on so when
we take a look at these words all of
them have this but just a little bit to
varying degrees with the Strix and with
the - a you're gonna have a single slot
and then with the deluxe you're going to
have four slots but every single slot
regardless does have the new soldering
process that's been implemented so it's
actually still regardless and
improvement for movement or previous
generation boards let's transition
though for any of you guys out there
like the true enthusiasts who really
don't care or give a damn what the board
looks like let's talk about actual
performance connectivity so across the
board again okay I'm going to keep
saying that how can you connect external
devices storage to these boards
well externally if we went externally
route I guess I'm thinking external that
I'm Emmett how can you connect any
storage devices right board so we can
a little bit above so first and foremost
for the internal stuff that a lot of us
are going to be interested in we've got
all the cupboards bases so you got
serial ata you got m dot 2 and you got
YouTube and we also have SATA Express
and we'll talk about set Express in
terms of an external connection in a
moment but that means regardless of
whatever type of connection you're going
to put on this board in terms of the
interface for your drive you're good to
go you don't need to worry about it
two things I do want to know is that
MDOT - if we take a look at the boards
we were very conscious about making sure
that we want to isolate it from where
you don't have the heart the largest
buildup for temperatures or CPU heat or
GPU heat buildup a lot of times you see
an MDOT - directly underneath that
primary physical by 16 or above the
primary by 16 that's going to be an area
where you have the largest amount of
heat that pulls up from the graphics
card or from the CPU so on boards like
the - a you can see that it's all the
way down here at the very bottom of the
board right so that's isolated away same
thing here you're going to have that
with the Strix and with the deluxe it's
actually vertically which is something
that you notice even in previous
generation because we had the same type
of design so it's really isolated away
from primary heat zones so that's a
really nice plus point with you dot to
implement on all these boards you don't
have to worry about doing something like
we have with our previous gens where you
had the hyper kit adapter which while
it's awesome now you just have that
ability you can natively interface and
you have to benefit with you - of course
they go to much higher capacity so you
go up to 1.2 terabytes and newer drives
that are coming to market we're talking
two to three plus terabytes of ultra
high-speed assist the story is you just
physically can't fit that much storage
on a standard MDOT - you know stick a
gun style drive exactly so you know for
here it's the best of both worlds it's
entirely up to you and we still continue
also have on all our raid software
that's built into the UEFI so if you
want to easily be able to raid volumes
at a touch of a button it can
automatically go ahead and do that for
you
now speaking of externally you did make
a quick note on that all of you boards
do fully support Thunderbolt 3 also we
have a specialized header that's on the
board that we had just like in previous
generations so you can go ahead and drop
on our Thunderbolt expansion card and so
that gives you Thunderbolt 3 if you want
to have high-speed external storage or
display connectivity or whatever you
want
the dual export actually even comes
included with the Thunderbolt card
inside the box so that's a nice touch
point and for a lot of people that ask
about the serial ata actually SATA
Express connection on the board that's
there for one because it's tied in with
PCH directly so those are SATA ports
you don't have to use it ascetics rs.20
site Express dries but if you want to
leverage the PCI Express that's that
Express gives you we can use that for
front USB 3.1 connectivity so we have
two breakout panels one is a type-a in
the elements type C with the type C also
offering USB power delivery for
essentially for next-generation devices
so like external hard drive and stuff
like that you won't have to have like AC
adapters that you can just bus powered
so on top of all the USB connectivity
that you already have on all these
boards and there's USB 3 and 3.1 type a
and type C type a and type you got all
the connections covered every boards
gonna have USB 3 3.1 type a Type C it's
all onboard and then you can add another
one via that SATA Express which I'm glad
there's some good use for setting
Express to be yeah yeah well that's our
goal is that we just want to be able to
provide value to the PCI Express
signaling and same thing also for you
guys that are building in those nicer
higher inch a C's that have up to 4 USB
ports all the board's have dual front
USB 3 headers as well nice for the fan
aspect of it this is where things just
get utterly insane this fan expert which
version are we on bore for Quatro for
you guys so it supports for fans yes no
more than for quite a bit more than four
so for every one of the boards they all
feature pretty much the best fan
controls in the industry we've taken it
to just the next level when we talk
about this stuff so every single header
fully supports DC and PWM output
controls so that means doesn't matter
what type of fan you connect to it it's
going to fully be able to control it we
now have full automatic fan detection
for DC or PWM fans so that's great
because that means when you run the
automatic fan profiling not only are we
gonna know what type of fan you've
connected but we also fully figure out
the minimum and maximum operating curves
are dedicated water pump header so if
you're throwing in like a closed loop
water cooling solution you have a
dedicated PWM pump for your custom water
cooling setup you had to have a
dedicated pump that you can calibrate
and control we have a high amperage
dedicated fan header for you crazy guys
that want to be able to run really
high-grade rpm based fans but you can
use it like a traditional fan they're
good to go you can also fully customize
all the parameters whether you're
talking about fan speeds or even ramping
aspects not only in the operating system
but also fully within the UEFI so if you
don't want to use our software interface
you can even do the full calibration and
all the targeted level of controls
inside the operating system and I think
one of the kind of last couple of really
cool points that we have here and I
think something that you
when we were talking about you really
impressed with is the temperature input
mapping yes traditionally when you take
a look at a motherboard most people
realize that the CPU fans as well as all
the fans on the system respond to just
the CPU temperature but if you got a
great cooling solution you jump into a
game let's say like Starcraft 2 that CP
type is going to be pretty low so your
intake pens might not necessarily really
ramped up to provide more airflow to
your graphics card but now with our
boards we have multiple temperature
input sources so for like the CPU the
vrm the PCIe slot the motherboard the
PCH different places every single header
can be mapped to a different temperature
input source so that that fan can
respond most effectively to how you have
your system set up and to what your
demands are within your system it's all
the touch of a button which is cool with
the v optimization auto overclocked
calibrate your fans and then if you even
want to do some crazy stuff we have our
new turbo app application which allow
you to customize being do like unique
profiling so that you can have specific
fan profiles and even specific
overclocks based on the programs that
you open and close and launch
so it's something probably a little bit
creative for you guys to think about it
consciously about how you work with your
system but imagine you know being at
full stock with your system low power
consumption quite operation when you're
in Chrome then you're jumping in just
cos three your fans ramped up with your
overclock and then maybe jump into your
editing program with a different clock
speed across all the cores different
prioritization for your network and
different fan profiles and you didn't
have to do anything because you
customized all those profiles before all
right JJ how about audio we have supreme
effects this is actually something that
was a little bit of a distinction
between the Strix board and the x99
records all the board's feature are
isolated audio design which kind of
everybody is familiar with at this point
so you got you know audio grade
capacitors you got an operational
amplifier we have our D pop filter which
helps to reduce any popping they might
hear when you restart the system now a
shielded codec all that good stuff but
two unique things is one with the
Signature Series boards we have what's
called a pre input power regulator okay
and that's because ultimately you're
still sharing power with the rest of the
motherboard right and so we were trying
to clean up additional noise that can
sometimes present itself still have
maybe users get a little bit of that
maybe humming or certain noise that can
kind of introduces itself for the front
headphone connections so this is a way
of helping to really reduce that down to
the lowest that we've ever had on a
motherboard so that's a further
well that we've improved the audio
experience on the Strix board a unique
attribute is that unlike the a the are
the deluxe which have a single op-amp
there's actually dual op amps on the
board and this is nice because if you're
using headphones either on the line out
connection or the front headphone
connection
you actually can receive that
amplification to give you a little bit
more punch up in the volume open up the
soundstage so awesome nice improvements
there on the audio side beautiful next I
want to give you guys a little bit of a
closer look at each board I'm going to
ask JJ to quickly tell us what makes
each board distinct unique or what his
favorite features are we're going to
start off with the most budget-friendly
board the x99 - e which we don't have
right here but here's a picture of it
and JJ what do you what do you thing
about this board very competitive price
point 229 $219 youto 220 bucks for a
board that's going to give you a CS
quality great premium design it's got
the fan expert for it has actually
lighting on the board for the audio
section and for the PCIe slots you've
even got a single save slot you got all
the great connections on it it's really
just a reduction in a couple of the key
aesthetic attributes and some of the
connections things like Wi-Fi or some of
the additional connections you have in
terms of Morse added things along those
lines but great foundation for anybody
looking for a more aggressively price
bill so JJ what's your favorite thing
about the x99 a version - you know I
think it's just an awesome bang for the
buck board I think it looks great I love
the fact that you've got those three
zones of lighting you know with the PCH
the PCI slots and you know on the
crystal sound 3.0 area but I think it's
just it's got everything packed in and
it's pretty much everything I want and
nothing really extra superfluous but
it's just got it's all packed in there
and all the nice little things on the
board that you know are hard to come
find it's call out but they're all there
- you know you got an easy exit piece
which you know you've got the digital
power delivery for the membrane for the
CPU you got those great quality power
components you know quick LEDs that you
bug the board is really nice when you
put together the system for your CPU for
your memory for your DRAM for your
storage devices so I think all those
little things baked in are just really
nice and overall I think the aesthetic
looks great look really those Tim's that
you put on there look - oh yeah had
g.skill memory definitely gotta love it
check it out guys super sexy
here is the x99 Strix JJ you got it
there's got to be a lot of love for this
absolutely love it I mean I think you
just look at it right off the bat I love
just that kind of that dark
monochromatic look and feel in some ways
that angles I think also have a really
nice just aggressiveness to it without
just being overbearing and I just love
the positioning of all the lighting on
the board too I think that having that
centralized RGB lighting for the
Republican gamers logo is killer and
even little things actually I really
like - as I like that we made this
compatible with our ROG front base so
that if you really want to maximise the
front headphone quality you can bypass
the NIR chassis unit that is an optional
accessory but I think where anybody is
seriously taking a look at a board
that's got a really clean aesthetic the
fact you know that every single slot on
here is pretty much all blacked out I
think it's going to really complement
the really nice contrasting colors
especially if you want to go with bright
colors you know blue why red anything
like that it's gonna be great looking
combination so love this board and
here's the x99 deluxe version - I really
like this board do you guys just let you
know I will be doing a full review of
this board although probably not until I
get back from Computex yeah I think this
is a beautiful looking board and I love
also just the the beefiness of it when
you look at it you know those huge heat
pipes you've got one here in the central
portion of the board that extends into
PCH and then you've got that really big
heat pipe that extends from the primary
Bri heat sink all the way into another
heat sink goes into the i/o shroud I
think that's just awesome helps to keep
the board really cool but all the little
subtle touches on this board are great
in terms of you know things like dual
you die - with I love the vertical you
got - and the vertical MDOT - on this
board oh yeah I think that's a really
nice touch but I didn't even notice the
vertical you dot - yeah so you can see
right there that's fun vertical and
vertical so side by side all those
little touches I think on this board in
the fact that it just it comes packed in
with the fan extension card the
Thunderbolt 3 the secondary hyper m dot
- expansion card are all inside the box
and the three zones of lighting and that
really clean crystal 3.0 shroud which is
RGB I think it's just an awesome board
and that's just about gonna wrap it up
for this video guys thank you for
sticking with us all the way through all
of these boards will be available if not
now very very soon so check out your
favorite online retailer for them JJ
thank you so much for coming by today
and doing what you do thanks for him
here and that's been awesome you should
and and guys let me know in the comments
section if whenever asus has launches
like these you want JD to come by and
tell us all the information because I
know I get a lot out of it and I hope
you do too
thanks for watching this video hit the
