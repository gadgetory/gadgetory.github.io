ddr4 memory gives you blazing fast speed
and dynamic multi zone RGB lighting with
ten ultra-bright LEDs per module
customization options are practically
endless with the corsair IQ software
package and they're available with black
or white heat spreaders find out more
about the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro
series via the sponsor link in the
description what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware this is another video
about a massive overpowered computer and
this computer is named Riptide and if
you're watching my channel over the
summer you probably saw me putting it
together it is an insane overpowered
system there's actually two builds in
here FreeNAS system in the bottom and an
epic gaming slash multi use editing rig
in the top and I haven't actually really
powered it up much for the past three or
four weeks because I've been traveling
in other things but I have a bit of a
situation right now today's video is
mostly gonna be about the lighting in
the system because whereas I got it all
set up and plugged in and I have a crazy
amount of course there ll series fans as
well as some other RGB elements
throughout when I powered this on
yesterday I realized a bit of a problem
which is that we got some action going
on with this reservoir over here on the
right but the one on the Left which is
the CPU loop there's nothing really
going on with that one so unfortunately
it seems like one of my pumps has died
very sad about that it happened quickly
so I guess that's good I already talked
to alpha cool about it and they are
sending me over replacements for the
time being though I can't really run
this system because the CPU is just
overheating I was getting too warm to
the point where it couldn't even
recognize the memory properly but I
think I might have a temporary solution
to get us through today's video and that
is thanks to all of the quick
disconnects I have this is actually a
pretty flexible system considering that
it is custom water-cooled so first off
let me shut it off so right now I have
two separate loops this one is cooling
the CPU and going up to the top radiator
and then this one on the right is
cooling both
GPUs and going to the two front
radiators but look what I can do with my
quick disconnects I'm gonna pop that out
I'm gonna pop this out I'm going to
connect that
right there I'm gonna connect this right
here so obviously not as pretty now but
I've gone from two distinct separate
loops running in parallel to both loops
running in series since we're gonna go
through the GPUs over here and then out
back into this pump and then up to the
CPU and then out of there and back into
this one and it's just gonna cycle
through there even though the pumps not
running so I do have some built-in
redundancy with this system which is
nice although I'd much rather have both
pumps up and running this will work for
now so guys if it wasn't clear from the
get-go there's a lot of coarser
equipment in this build and a lot of it
is RGB related and Corsair has software
called IQ this is somewhat recent prior
to this they've had a couple different
softwares Corsair link that could
monitor your Corsair equipment that you
have installed and then a separate
software for RGB lighting they have now
combined it all together and here is a
quick look at the user interface that
brings us here and this is the default
home page where you can get a look at
the hardware you have connected
unfortunately all of my hardware was
recognized I've gotten full course
thereby also connecting up a k70 RGB
keyboard m65 pro RGB Mouse of course I
have the X 1600 I power supply installed
and since I connected the USB from that
to the motherboard that's being
recognized I got my vengeance RGB memory
kits the Obsidian 1000 d case which
actually has a built-in commander pro
which registers it as the 1000 d so it
can determine that that is distinct from
add-on commander pro's then I have an
add-on commander Pro and an add-on
lighting node Pro now my focus today is
going to be on lighting but I'm quickly
going to work kind of backwards here and
jump over to the Settings tab because
here you can determine all of your
different hardware that's connected and
here's where you would adjust specific
stuff like on your power supply for
example this is stuff that link was
formerly able to do also more specific
settings like keyboard and mouse and
it'll also give you updates or access to
firmware updates here also down on the
bottom you can access some basic
functions of the software itself like
changing from Celsius to Fahrenheit for
the display above beyond that back over
on the home page we can see on the upper
left side we can create profiles and
create new profiles by just clicking the
plus it will add one on there you can
name the profile yourself and then you
can also use the little icons to delete
the profile if you want to you can also
copy profiles and you can import and
export them as well I have not
messed around with importing and
exporting but I imagine if somebody has
a very similar setup to you and they've
done a bunch of cool laying
configurations with it then you could
download that and save yourself some
work and one last thing before we get
into the lighting is the dashboard over
here and you can add and remove modules
to this and it just gives you sort of a
visual look at the stuff that's
connected so I can see on my memory here
and the speeds and timings and the
current temperatures I can see some
specs for my case and the case fans as
well as case fan RPMs and everything for
the commander pro and basic stats for
the power supply if you're looking at
the system right now you might notice
that it's pretty much all whites and in
fact my keyboard here is all whites and
the mouse is all white on the lighting
too and that is because I used this very
easy to use instant lighting feature I
thought this was a pretty cool feature
when I was first showed it at CES and
yes it is also compatible to memory
although that does take another second
or two just a really simple way to
choose a single color and they have a
nice assortment of them here although
they don't always appear exactly how
they should like for instance that's
supposed to be kind of orange a little
bit more yellow but another cool feature
here is if you go and choose the black
option everything turns off so if you
want to watch a movie or something I
have really quick access to doing that
and then you can also choose the X here
and that will turn off instant lighting
so you can go over and use your profiles
which are going to be a little bit more
advanced so once you've chosen a profile
and I've made one here called blue and
white because that's really been my goal
is to set up all the lights here to be
mostly blue and light so it matches with
my custom cables by woz mods and here
once you've chosen a device like the RGB
memory you can go and choose lighting
effects and that will allow you to
adjust the lighting effects now over
here on the left side are layers and if
you've ever used Photoshop for example
this is a great way to think about it
the layer on top is the one that will be
visible and then layers beneath that
will shine through if there's no other
layer on top of that that has a light to
supersede it so for this setup I made
two layers with the lower layer I chose
dims one three six and eight with the
upper layer I chose dims two four five
and six and that gave me a nice
coordination and by the way if you're if
you just if you deselect or reselect the
dims here you can sort of see which one
you're selecting at any given time like
that's seven that's five that's two and
that's four so if you want it to be
somewhat symmetrical when you're looking
at it from the front and you have eight
dims let's do another one and start from
scratch here so you guys can get a
better
look I've added a lighting effect which
applied to all of the RAM sticks and
next I'm going to let's switch to static
color just so it's a little easier to
keep track of and let's make all of
these like a nice light blue color and
that should reflect there yes not too
bad from here again I can deselect
certain Ram sticks that I do not want to
include with my additional color so now
I have one layer up here that has just
dims one three six and eight to be that
blue color and that's just static now if
I wanted to I could add another lighting
effects here now it's on top it's up
above so it is overwritten the static
color if I were to drag that down and
put it underneath we could see the
rainbow shining through underneath here
whereas that static blue color is still
on top so this shows you how you can
kind of overlap and layer different
effects to make it look how you want to
so here I switch that second layer to
color pulse and I've chosen just red and
white so now we should have static blue
and then we should have pulsing for the
other four dims between red and white so
there's the blue with the red and now
the Reds gonna shift to whites well it
pulses so it turns off and then comes
back on as white just like that
beautiful beautiful
alright so shift just transitions
between the colors without dimming out
first so now we have blue with red and
white shifting in between feeling the
only very patriotic today go America
everyone register to vote now a
vengeance memory lets us individually
address each dim but not each LED again
that's just the type of memory that I
have and it's because I wanted 128 gig
kits of course there's new memory isn't
available in that yet or at least it
wasn't when I built the system but what
if you're selecting a device that has
multiple lights multiple addressable
LEDs or multiple devices each with
addressable LEDs and for that I have
gone and selected our actual obsidian D
case and you'll notice on the left you
have lighting setup as well as chassis
lighting so setup here is where you can
actually tell it for which channels that
are available what is actually connected
to it so simplest device to show you
this was probably gonna be the lighting
node Pro which is just has a couple LED
channels that come out of it if we go to
lighting setup here we can see the two
channels and we can tell it what device
is actually connected this is telling it
how many LEDs it will need to address
and when it comes to addressable LED
strips and you can't automatically
detect that you have to
what's there so for example here with
lighting channel 2 this is actually
where my LED strips at the bottom of the
case are connected so I have different
options to choose from here if I tell it
it's got an RGB light strip connected to
it and I tell it one strip is connected
then down there at the bottom of my case
where I have two light strips connected
one will light up but even though the
other one is plugged in it's not
lighting up so what happens when I tell
it to are connected so here you go just
jumping from one strip to two strips and
now the second strip lights up because
we have told the program how much power
to use so using that method I've gone
through each device just to make sure
everything is connected and I found that
pretty much everything is there except I
did make one mistake if I go over to the
lighting node Pro here which again has
two LED channels connected to its if I
change that to none that's lighting
channel 1 you might notice that my front
Corsair logo and actually at the top the
IOR jeebies go out if I tell it it's an
RGB strip and three strips are connected
then they start working again that's not
exactly how it should work because there
is an obsidian connection point here and
that is where those front panel things
should be connected to so I think just
so everything is going to be connected
right to where it should go and what I'm
selecting is actually representing the
right color I'm gonna do a quick rewire
and see if I can plug that lighting node
Pro back into light strips or fans and
plug the Obsidian controller back into
the Obsidian LEDs so I did manage to fix
the wiring up mostly at least the front
panels are now connecting properly so
that I can address them if I choose the
Obsidian over here I actually have the
chassis lighting and then I have the
individual lighting channel that I've
set up and right now I have overlaid two
effects so you can kind of get an idea
of putting something on top of another
thing I chose static color and I went to
every single device and I set it to be
that static color of pink and then I
used lighting link which is a universal
lighting effect that can apply to all
addressable LEDs in the system
bear in mind addressable only so
lighting link actually is not an effect
that I can put over our memory right now
but if you switch to that addressable
LED memory it will be able to do that
but more to the point with the static
color on the bottom and I just made that
pink and you can actually individually
choose which LEDs you want to apply an
effect to for an example like
there that's just pink now or our versus
selecting me all of the LEDs in that fan
or all the other LEDs and both of these
fans are like just these four LEDs from
those two fans it's actually really
flexible when it comes to the
addressable LEDs but I've just chosen
them all and then I've used that
lighting link which again is universal
effects that becomes available as a
third option here light link effects
will apply to all addressable LEDs that
are connected to IQ software and now you
can see that visor effect which is kind
of like the kit effect from Knight Rider
and it just goes over all of the LEDs
and since everything is more or less in
order it will actually cycle through so
it's kind of cool to watch it come
across the LED strip on the bottom to
get up to the front LED fans there's a
couple on the top I think fans that are
not quite in the exact right order but I
will probably go back and fix that at a
future time so just to do one more quick
lighting demo I set up a blue and white
color scheme and I think my favorite
thing that this software is able to do
is the overlapping of two effects on top
of each other so I've been going with
the method of choosing a static
background color white is pretty
Universal of matches with most other
colors and then choosing an effect
overlay on top such as arc arcs one of
the fun ones that I found to your heart
beat pong these are gonna work
differently depending on what you have
set up and also some of these effects
are applicable to the light loop series
fans because they have 16 individual
addressable LEDs whereas some of the
effects are not so you actually find
with certain devices like if I go over
here to the Obsidian 1000d here's all of
my LEDs available on that I actually
don't have the ark choice as an option
down here simply because these LEDs are
a little bit more limited than the light
loop series fans are but by using a
combination of laying visor over the top
and laying that arc effect over the top
I came out with what you see in front of
you right now which I think looks pretty
cool of course there's tons of tweaking
and stuff that could still be done with
it but that's the whole point is that
it's very flexible so you can set the
lighting up however you want it to look
and hopefully make it look pretty and
match with your overall color scheme
that said if you've been looking close
up at the actual build you might notice
that not all my LEDs are lining up I've
got the memory I've got all the fans
I've got
light strip at the bottom I've got the
LEDs on the case itself what I do not
have are the LEDs on the motherboard
that strip going down the right side of
the RG zenith extreme from Asus and then
there's an accent LED on the top left
there too unfortunately the LED control
software is still a little bit
disjointed depending on what hardware
you're using and what software you're
using so I cannot control the LEDs on
the motherboard with the Corsair IQ
software so I'm gonna install ASIS or a
sink right now which has its own pluses
and minuses when it comes to
compatibility and bugginess and stuff
and I'm gonna cross my fingers that I
don't run into any of those issues
because I know both of the software's
are going to be trying to control the
RGB lighting on the memory for example
that said let's download and install
aura and see if I can get all the LEDs
in the system to line up or is install
did a quick restarts and weird micro
files go out here we go there's my blue
and white it's thinking it's thinking
about doing what I want it to do no it's
not a sues took it over
oh those jerks alright so first thing
I've discovered here is that the AC
source sync software has apparently
taken over control of my RGB dims very
unfortunate asus cuz you know I had a
cool effect going on there but let's see
what you have available for me so first
off let's see if I could just disconnect
the DRAM save save the changes DRAM is
disconnected I can turn the lights on or
off so I currently do not know how to
like detach the memory from the asus or
a software and let the corsair IQ
software control it's maybe installing
one than the other or something like
that i'm happy right now that I'm not
getting any direct conflicts that's
causing the system to lock up or colors
not to actually take effect but I think
to give myself something functional to
work with for now I'm gonna go to
rainbow gradients this has been my go-to
effect for RGB lighting scenarios
because it allows you to choose a range
of colors here so you don't necessarily
get the rainbow vomit a lot of people
have kind of gotten over and but I'm
going to just choose from sort of a
lighter blue to a darker blue I'll hit
apply there and then that should affect
my memory sticks as well as those RGB
accents on the motherboard and get
everything matching up pretty nicely
with the color scheme that I chose with
IQ but guys that is pretty much going to
be all for this video I really just
wanted to get this system back up
running since it's been a while since I
messed around with it and yes I do have
further coverage planned on this of
course I'm going to need to swap out
that pump and my goal has really been to
actually use the system from the day one
I want to use this system I need to get
integrated into my computer room back
there
so another follow up is going to be
building just a platform a stand a
computer off floor option that will hold
this system and integrate it into my
computer room back there and then of
course I've got the swap of the pump and
I'm gonna be upgrading the waterblock
here from this CPU only dedicated alpha
cool block to a full mono block because
ek makes a mono block for the X 399
these two Xenith motherboard so that's
coming in the future too I hope you guys
have enjoyed this video though and
learned a little bit more about the
complexities of setting up not just the
system but getting all the lighting
wired in and then actually using the
software to set up the lighting to look
something akin to what you maybe had in
mind when you're originally building the
system I like what I've got for now
first I'm gonna set up some more
profiles for this too I think in the
future but guys definitely hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video hit the subscribe button too if
you want to be notified a little bail
notification icon - that's helpful to
you get a notification once I post the
follow up videos on this system it's
good to get back to it since I've been
covering the RT x-series for a very long
time thanks again for watching though
guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
