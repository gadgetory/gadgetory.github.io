of hype and anticipation around the AMD
radeon rx4 80 launch so now that we can
actually review the cards let me give
you guys a short version right up front
the RX 480 is a very good graphics card
for 200 or $240 for the 4 or 8 gig
versions respectively its performances
in the GTX 970 range and it has some
compelling next-gen features to improve
VR and asynchronous compute performance
it's not going to beat a gtx 980 or 1070
unless maybe you get two radeon RX 4 IDs
and i'll think about doing a crossfire
video if you guys maybe think about
hitting that like button and it's pretty
darn quiet at stock fan speeds as well
overclocking is possible but not a ton
of headroom and yes there will be
benchmarks later in this video that have
overclocking numbers and all that good
stuff but first the card itself it's
black got some red accents on there
nothing too blingy with the reference
are X 480 no lights design cues were
taken from the fury and fury X line and
I actually think I like it it's pretty
subtle it could use a backplate though
but some add-in board manufacturers like
FX FX and Sapphire are already
outfitting theirs with them or so I have
heard the shroud is made of black
plastic with glossy parts where the red
Radeon logos are and a rubberized panel
across the front with a grid of dots
across it for some texture the PCB seen
from the back is short which means we
couldn't see some very small versions of
this card in the future the rest of the
cards 9.5 inch or 242 millimeter length
is taken up by the blower style fan with
its metal housing it's open on both
sides so you can kind of see through it
like my facade of calmness and composure
the GPU beneath that cooler is the
Polaris 10 XT it's based on brand-new
GCM 2.0 14 nanometer FinFET architecture
sports 2304 stream processors 36 compute
units up to 5.8 teraflops of raw compute
performance and just a 150 watt board
power hence only requiring a single 6
pin PCI Express power connector the card
I'm using today has 8 gigs of 256 bit
gddr5 memory at 8000 megahertz effective
clock speed video outs are on hdmi 2.0 B
and 3 DisplayPort 1.4 s meeting support
for very high resolutions and refresh
rates like 4k a hundred and twenty Hertz
as well as HDR displays via that display
park
action which can display way more colors
than standard dynamic range displays so
this card is ready for next-gen monitors
AMD has a lot of Technology wrapped up
in our X 480 and of course you still get
support for legacy stuff like free sync
and Vulcan a new feature called
framerate targeting control allows you
to set a maximum frame rate limit for
games like csgo that don't need a lot of
GPU performance that's just to save
power which seems like a good idea but
let's quickly talk about asynchronous
compute asynchronous just means out of
order basically and it's allowing the
GPU to dynamically handle different
tasks like graphics or GPU compute
without having to wait for one or the
other to finish the Polaris architecture
has dedicated Hardware called
asynchronous compute engines which are
specifically designed to do these tasks
at very high speeds
since VR naturally has a lot more
asynchronous compute tasks involved such
as head mounted display tracking that
needs to be updated very late in the
processing pipeline having dedicated
Hardware available means the our X 480
has better than expected VR performance
for its class VR benchmarking is still
in its infancy but the steam VR
performance tests can give us an idea of
where these cards stand and the rx 480
is well within that green zone for fully
VR ready i over clocked my rx 480 by 5%
and I got the memory up to 80 to 20
effective clock speed I did this with
wot man the overclocking utility that's
built into the Radeon crimson software
which has come a really long way in the
past year or so it's a lot cleaner the
UI is pretty easy to figure out and you
can use the Whatman utility that's built
into it to assign specific overclocking
profiles to different games overclocking
itself is handled by adjusting a
frequency curve with different
overclocks and voltages available for
each power state you can use a slider to
adjust the curve as a whole or in manual
mode you can assign different
frequencies and voltages independently
you can also control fan speed and
temperature based on target and Max
values there's a power limit option
which is down in the temperature section
for some reason which is kind of
confusing at first but I figured it out
and there's a nice histogram at the top
that shows GPU activity frequencies
temperature and fan curve it was enough
for me to use for monitoring during my
OC testing so I think the Radeon team
has done a pretty good job here my only
complaints would be that I'd like to see
unlocked voltage you can't go higher
than the 1150 millivolt max setting that
it starts off with and it's also in need
of a profile
system so you can quickly save and load
overclocking settings at last it is time
for benchmarks here's my 59 30 K based
testbed system specs and the cards I'll
be comparing the RX 480 to choosing
comparison GPUs is not easy for
something like this but ultimately I
decided that the gtx 970 and the gtx 960
for gig would be the closest competitors
on team green and I threw them 1070 in
there just because I wanted to see where
the upper tier cards were sitting by
comparison
remember the 1070 costs twice as much as
the RX 4 80 right now since I have stock
and overclocked numbers for the RX 4 80
I chose all aftermarket cards for the
Nvidia competition that have healthy
reasonable but not insane over clocks
from the manufacturer I also have
included 4k numbers just to see how the
480 performs even though it's more
suited for 1080 and 1440 gameplay in my
opinion time for some benchmarks
so what have we learned from these
benchmarks well first the rx 40 stomps
all over the gtx 960 4 gig and it hangs
pretty darn close to the 970 and even
beats it in a few games the 970 also
shows that limitations when using 3.5
gigs of VRAM or more such as in the
hitman benchmark scores and several
other 4k scores as well tomb raider
ashes at the singularity and hitman are
all DirectX 12 titles shown here as well
and while the differences weren't stark
except for maybe a hitman which is an
AMD gaming evolved title which might
have some to do with it I think the
async compute bonus did help the 480
pull out a few more wins over the 970
temperatures were normal for the 480 and
by normal I mean they hit the target
temperature of 80 degrees Celsius peaked
at 83 degrees not the coolest running
card but I can't see potential for
third-party coolers to help with this
and the fan noise even at that
temperature was not bad at all
as for frequencies pretty much every GPU
that I tested throttled frequency to
some degree except maybe the 960 after
warming up to max temperature the RX 480
overclocked hit 1330 megahertz but only
fell off maybe 30 to 60 points under
full load with about the same result at
stock not bad but I'm really curious to
see how fast the 480 could run with
better cooling as for fan noise I was
quite pleased with the stock profile and
AMD was true to their word that they
didn't want a noisy reference cooler
unfortunately I had to ramp up the fan
to get any reasonable overclock going so
here's a listen to the fan at idle
here's the fan under load still using
the stock profile
here's the fan set manually to 70%
and here's the fan at 100% where yes it
does get quite
finally some power draw results and
given the performance I am happy to say
that Radeon has really stepped up when
it comes to efficiency our X 480 does a
great job and is pretty much equivalent
to the 970 its conclusion time I kind of
started this video out with a conclusion
but to reiterate very good graphics card
for 200 to 230 dollars compelling
next-gen VR and async compute features
pretty quiet ok overclocking I think the
only way you'd be disappointed with this
card is if you were reading all the
articles or watching all the pre-launch
type videos talking about it beating the
1070 or 980 and running it 15 or 1600
plus megahertz the price is great and it
needed to be to hit in video where they
were lacking that substantial gap
between the 960 and the 970 the cheapest
970 s right now are still 260 plus
dollars and I think that price will
definitely be coming down to stay
competitive even if that happens the
extra vram the VR readiness and the
hardware async compute features of the
RX 4 80 would still make it a very tough
choice and hey one last plus for AMD is
stock availability as these cards should
actually be available everywhere today
launch day so you could actually buy one
which is helpful when you want a new
graphics card if I were to ask for more
I would have liked to see it overclock a
bit more as I to read the rumors and had
a bit higher hopes the temps are a bit
warm too but perhaps with binge GPUs
aftermarket coolers and Driver
refinements that we should be seeing in
the coming weeks we will see
improvements to those numbers if you are
looking for a 200 to 250 dollar GPU with
very solid performance plenty of VRAM
support for next gen displays an HDR and
especially if you've been looking at try
VAR but you haven't been able to afford
it I definitely recommend at the RX 480
