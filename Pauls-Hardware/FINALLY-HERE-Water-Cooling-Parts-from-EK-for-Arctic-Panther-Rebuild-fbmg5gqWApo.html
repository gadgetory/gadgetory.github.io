hey everybody how's it going and welcome
to Paul's hardware I wanted to keep
today's video fairly simple mainly to
make sure I can get it done without
anything going wrong so to that end I've
decided to move forward with my arctic
panther next step because I finally have
a bunch of parts that have arrived from
ek ek waterblock ckw B so I'm gonna post
links to the stuff at least a lot of the
stuff that's arrived here in this
video's description and the build I'm
going to be doing is going to be an in
cell build with an ex 299 chipset
motherboard the RG Strix from Asus right
here I have two way GTX 1080i is that
are gonna go in there to water cooling
stuff it's gonna be super exciting yeah
I also have two 7820 case that I need to
test up and see which one of them is
faster because when you get I want to
make sure whichever one can overclock
better actually goes in so anyway
oh that's ed let's dive right into it
and start cracking this box open I have
done zero prep like this is my first
time opening this box so I hope I hope
everything I did okay and shipping and
they also collected to cut all the tape
first in the box we have a err we got a
fair amount of air in here step aside
and then oh goodness
it's like a lot of things in here I when
you're getting stuff from ek since it's
got a ship overseas you gotta make sure
that I account for everything so I went
a little overkill with my plans
equipment but hopefully hopefully that
means that I won't have to order
anything that didn't that I forgot to
place in its order with the original
order that makes sense alright so item
number one is gonna be the fans and
these are the ek Vardar Evo the next
generation of ek far DARS fans and I
should using my knife to open these
boxes but I'm not
these fans are pretty straightforward
they're all black and they stay fairly
quiet so you know they they've done a
good job this is the fans that I had
used in or at least a prior version of
these is what I used in hotbox my life
system and they stay pretty quiet these
have a 500 to 2200 rpm range but I'm
gonna try to hopefully keep them at the
lower end of that range and I have eight
yeah I got eight of them total because
it's gonna be three in the top two in
the front one its weight in two three
four five six trying to do meth I have
eight of them because I have two intakes
at the front rad one I'm taking the
bottom that's three four five six one
two three four five six seven
maybe they just sent me an extra one
maybe I'm crazy or what
I think I'm just crazy i order to me
that's all right you gotta have a spare
in case one doesn't work for summer all
right
here's an extra cap let's get all the
fittings out okay now I think I can
actually continue so this is all the
individually back stuff I'm gonna go
over the this stuff that's non
individually boxed first first off the
the reservoir tube I wanted to be taller
I want a nice tall reservoir on there so
I got the extended version of that this
is a 250 millimeter I'm sorry 204
millimeter vertical variant of that so
there's that nice clear tube and this is
just an add-on piece you can get which
fits in pretty much all of the EK pump
reservoir combo or they also have
individual reservoir items you can get
i'm combining that with this piece which
is just a replacement cap that has three
inlets on the top because i'm sorry and
that's on the top as well as two on the
sides here and that's gonna get just
give me some more flexibility for how i
actually arrange stuff when this is
installed in the case since i have to
sort of figure out you know the
direction the loop goes in and
everything and i wanted to maintain
flexibility that was the main issue is
that like if i need to change something
or reroute something or decide that you
know this tube should go that way or
whatever i want to be able to do that I
also got some brackets here so these are
the reservoir holder brackets the X rays
x3 holder and those can be mounted at
the various places to hold the bracket
up I'm starting to hold the reservoir up
and then this is an actual pump bracket
that can mount on to a hundred and
twenty millimeter fan mount which is the
same basic solution that I had used in
the original arctic that they're
building however that one is a little
bit more official and doesn't involve me
just screwing a some screws on to places
where they're not typically supposed to
be screwed onto this is the internal
tube for the reservoir so then the water
comes in the top it doesn't splash
that's that's for ptg tubing of course I
got a bunch of this stuff
it all comes individually wrapped from
ek to make sure that the PTT tubing
itself doesn't get any any scuffs or
anything like that on it because let's
face it if your water cooling to this
level you're probably at least somewhat
concerned about aesthetic
and making sure that your tubing is nice
and pristine it's a good way to go about
doing that I hopefully got plenty I do
have some spare in the garage as well
from the hot box build so there should
be plenty of that because I want to I
want to try to do a little bit more
advanced bending if I can this time I
won't have to try to figure out some
ways of writing stuff to be unique now I
have fittings beyond that so these are
the hard line fittings that they have
these are made for the 16 millimeter
external diameter tubes which is what
these are tubes go on the end there and
then the fittings just unscrew like that
and then pop back on the top of course
with the o-ring in place to make sure
that everything stays water tight also
gonna attempt to keep these in their
individual wrappers because I don't want
those to get scuffed either now I have a
ton of fittings and here's where I
totally went over kill even ek was like
dude you got a lot of fittings you've
ordered here but this is gonna be this
problem to go towards a couple projects
cuz like I said I'm gonna be doing a
thread Ripper water-cooled build as well
not just the intel-based of article
build that I'm working on right now but
I have caps fittings of various sizes
rotary fittings so that you can attach
them and then angle them a little bit to
give yourself a little bit more leeway
as you're doing the tubing those are
super super helpful especially with hard
line stuff because sometimes with hard
line and you can get it bits where it's
almost perfect but you need just that a
little bit of wiggle room and that's
what a lot of these can help to set you
up with I did also get a few specialty
pieces like this one which is a fill
ports because that is the other thing I
want to do besides potentially doing
some fancy bins this time is make sure
that it's a little bit easier to drain
and refill the loop after it's been
built because if you saw my arctic
panther after like opening it up after a
year and a half to two years of use with
the minimal amount of maintenance that I
should have done with it I'm making the
mainly it's a little bit easier I think
it's gonna be a good way to go about
things this time around so I've got some
fill port caps and just a bunch of other
fitting series splitters and this will
all hopefully allow me to arrange those
parts the way I need to so I can have my
fill port a drain porch and all that
good stuff alright I actually have two
blocks that arrived in this shipping to
water blocks
I should say and because they sent me
both they sent me the case supremacy Evo
AMD Edition which is just the AMD F
fitted am for mount for water cooling
and AMD system and this is just going in
so allow me to do some water cooling
playing around with with AMD which is
cool because I have that capability for
Intel but this is going to expand my
capabilities in that area I'm not going
to be using this for this particular
build right now but got the potential
for some rise in water cooling in the
future so that's cool what I'm actually
using for this build is this mono block
here which I'm kind of excited about
because I've never actually built a
system with a mono block before so this
will be a slightly new experience the
mono block is basically a CPU block that
expands and there's various types of
monoblocks some mono blocks are made
like this one where it's gonna basically
be covering the CPU on the bottom that
contact plate is going to make contact
with the CPU and keep it cool and then
there's also an additional piece over
here that will make contact with the vrm
so the power delivery which with X 299
and keeping those cool can be very
important Gabara and several others have
done tests that show that it can be
pretty challenging to keep the vrm
equipment cool on an X 299 motherboard
of course depending on which one you use
now this is also the Strix version which
means it comes with an LED lead on it
and LEDs in that are built in there too
since the Strix has the RGB LED
capability this plugs in and the block
lights up too so I'm pretty stoked to
get that up and running as well also
interesting with the monoblock is they
you don't know it's like kind of the
standard input right there that you do
with a with your typical block so it's
got their all to the side there so that
it can actually make the full circuit
there and keep everything cool so that's
gonna be fun and this is a this is a
brand new part EK just launched the mono
block for the Strix X $2.99 and I
believe they're working on variants of
those for thread Ripper boards as well
alright let's let's take a quick look at
our pump rizz here we have our pump and
our reservoir they come together in the
same unit
is the EK extras spc BBC version it is a
PWM controllable pump and if you might
notice it comes with the surety version
of the reservoir and that's why I got
the extension which will pop on there so
make it to much taller dollar yes a
side-by-side comparison they're more or
less this one is much longer longer
theoretically being better in this case
beyond that this is roughly the same
that's not exactly the same pump that I
used in the original Arctic net ability
it's close enough
these are nice quiet pumps very solid
very reliable a lot more reliable than
some of the i/o pumps I've been using
recently so I'm pretty confident that
one's gonna do a good job too alright I
am almost done unwrapping all of these
things I think I'm getting close these
are the reservoirs and I've got a 360
and a 240 240 goes in front the 360 goes
on the top and I could be wrong but this
might be this one might be too thick
this is the cool stream PE and this is
the cool stream se which is the slim
this one might be the thicker like 38
millimeter thick version of that
radiator but we'll double check it and
you know worst case scenario we'll swap
that out and get a new one all right
here's the radiator cool stream se this
is the exact same one that I used for
the original arctic panther so there's
not too much different here
copper radiator kind of a medium fenced
in density there so nice balance between
cooling as well as allowing for air flow
and then of course just got the
captain's and will integrate that into
the loop ASAP let's open this larger one
and see if it actually is much thicker
if it is much thicker
I mean I could I could see if it'll fit
I don't know a little extra radiator
thermal mass isn't gonna kill me but
it's really it's really down to the
width of this because I need to make
sure have enough vertical space in the
case to actually make use of the radiate
here make sure it'll fit in there all
right this is definitely the thicker
version yeah this is the cool stream PE
so here's a quick side-by-side
comparison of the two of those and you
can see a much thicker radiator here so
yeah well I'll probably do a test fit in
this because this is definitely gonna be
a two-stage build and I'll see if it
fits fit so go ahead and use it
if not we'll stuff that out and we'll
get the thinner version this special
editions the the PE what is P slim not
slim P would be thick no I don't I don't
know I don't know what to be maybe just
staying I think of synonyms for standard
this start with P Paul so the last thing
I have to show you guys here well they
this is a graphics card one of the two
graphics cards I'll be using the 1080 TI
now the backplate on this actually has
an RGB LED logo that lights up so IRAs
originally thinking like oh can I reuse
this Strix back plate that Asus is
included because it's not bad at all
unfortunately you do need to use the ek
provided back plates if you're swapping
it in with the GPU blocks that I'm using
so I'll have to figure out some other
something else to do with that RGB LED
lead I will be replacing it with this so
pretty pretty straightforward back plate
there in black it's got a nice shiny
finish on it but it does look pretty
clean so you know can't complain there
all right so here that's how that will
sit on there
and I don't know if you guys can tell
but like all of the all of the screw
points they don't match exactly they
mostly match uh yeah I think I think
it's mostly this one over here that's
not mad that's not lining up but anyway
we'll we'll check that out more
thoroughly when we get to the
installation part coming soon I hope
finally last bit of kits here to show
you guys is the actual GPU blocks these
are I'm super excited about because
they're made specifically for the asus
strix
at 1080i and 1080p high esteem card at
least Presta this year so that's kind of
cool when I built the original arctic
panther I use nine 80s and it was
supplanted by the 980 TI pretty quickly
these also have this new piece on the
end that's kind of optional and so these
also have this new piece here kind of
where the terminal would be a little
cover in between terminal cover and
that's actually optional so if you
prefer just the the more raw look of
like the terminal on the end here and
the connection points and especially if
you're using at doing a dual GPU
configuration like I'm doing you can
actually pop this piece off and go
without it just have that square piece
that's internal right there or you can
leave it on and it gives you the geforce
gtx 980ti logo right there and the ek
logo and you know you can have that
front facing on your system if you
prefer here on the bottom we can again
see it's nickel plated copper this is
where the waterblock makes contact with
the GPU and then there's also contact
points for VRMs as well as the gddr5 X
memory which of which you have 11 gigs
and then 1080i on the other side here we
can see the plexi which extends out to
cover most of the card although it's
clear at either end so you can actually
see through that to see parts of the PCB
that would be under there and then
you've got a panel here that covers I
don't know what exactly that's covering
but must be important then of course you
can see the channels here or at the GPU
heat dissipation actually occurs and
then when this is installed because I
probably am gonna be using some colored
fluid again most likely be using light
but still working that out
you will be able to see that a little
bit as well and planning on setting up
to the
connection points between the graphics
cards to where you can see it flow in
there - and the final little extra that
comes in the box is a wristband so can
add that to my collection of wristbands
and that is pretty much gonna do it for
this video you guys I know it's just
been an unboxing but I like unboxing new
fancy stuff that comes in the mail and
this box had oh my gosh so much exciting
stuff from ek so of course I need to get
this build underway like really really
soon but as luck would have it and
actually this happened two years ago -
whenever I have a crazy big
water-cooling project like this like
lined up it's like heatwave hits like
right now it's been 105 to 110 degrees
Fahrenheit here in Southern California
all week it's in another two three days
is supposed to cool off a little bit but
I hope it's enough that I can actually
work on this in the garage because I'd
rather not do the whole thing out here
the living room again anyway though guys
I've spoken a little bit too much
already for this video hit the thumbs up
button if you did enjoy it thank you so
much for watching we'll see you guys in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
