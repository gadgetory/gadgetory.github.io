PAX Prime 2015 coverage of course I need
to start out by thanking my sponsors
coolermaster and gigabyte for helping me
travel all the way to Seattle Washington
to bring you guys this coverage now my
first video was all about the hardware
but let's face it packs is really all
about video games for the most part so
I'm going to share with you guys some of
the video games that I encountered here
and I can't necessarily say this is a
all-encompassing example of all of the
games here but these are the ones I ran
across some of the ones I enjoyed and
some of my experiences with them and
also I'm going to throw in some
randomness and maybe some cosplay and
that kind of thing so keep watching and
hope you enjoy my coverage
alright guys i'm over at the indy mega
booth area we're checking out a game
called zing this is a first-person
public kind of game it's very
interesting
or why but I'm getting kind of a missed
bug right off the bat of the gate here
Bing is being played here with just a
keyboard mouse it's also available to
play with an oculus rift the LOB are in
there ok so zing is a puzzle adventure
game and Jenny's planet right now on the
oculus so it does have oculus support
which is pretty sweet if being a puzzle
adventure game
kind of kind of reminds me a little bit
of mist this is currently in its not to
beta yet it's in pre-production yeah I
don't know if that means it's an alpha
or somewhere between alpha and beta it's
a they are shooting for a spring launch
date so visually this game looks quite
stunning
that you get from optio support and
maybe we'll talk to Jenny here in just a
second and see what she thought so guys
just to round up for you what Zing's old
up since the Jenny Jenny wandered off
without let me get her opinion of it
hope it's it's a puzzle that venture
puzzle game there are no enemies again
this gives me a sort of a mixed bag but
a much more rich environment you have
control over things like what they and
you can control day and night you can
control the weather use that to solve
puzzles as you move through the world
and it's just a beautiful looking here
so excited to see this in again spring
of next year is when they're planning on
launching it guys I'm checking out a
game with Danny booth area called
through the woods and I'm talking about
Dan who is the sound designer from it so
Dan can you give us just the high-level
explanation of the game and kind of what
type of game it is and what what you do
in the game yeah so it's a psychological
horror game set in a forest in Norway
where you play as a mother whose son's
been kidnapped by creature from Norse
mythology and he's been dragged through
the forest and your job is to try and
find out is to follow that trail to find
out why they were kidnapped sorry why he
was kidnapped and where he's been taken
as well so very very lots of bright
colors very bubbly game no this is a
suspense game there's a there's a side
of it it says so scary I wet my pants
it's fun of you might kinda crisis just
just like candy crush that's really with
a good worker but I'm right so you did
sound design for this game how did how
did you go about recording some of the
audio for it so almost all the order for
this game so far has been recorded in a
forest just outside of Oslo the finest
called songs one which is a beautiful
huge forest
so all the audio has been taken for all
this all the ambience and the trees and
leaves or the footsteps a little bit of
wildlife's and birds and foliage and
sage has all been taken with with a
small field recording kids over a couple
of day camping trip and in the forest
there there's also along the way of your
stray from the path you can find some
journals and so
other kind of law from the islands where
this tells you that if you find these
things that tells you the reasons why
the kid was actually taking and who is
that what the creature is has taken the
child and also there are some some ruin
systems and some Old Norse rune zing of
mine carved into walls and rocks which
if you translate them using them we have
a you can either use google images to
find the ruin translator or if you know
emotionally in every rooms yeah didn't
ruin signally and we also have a little
translator wheel that we've designed
that can also help you that tells the
story of the island itself and the
people over on the islands before they
disappeared or whatever happened to them
alright so I've already been told
they're looking at if you if you rush to
the game it's about three hours with
crying several more than that if you go
into more depth and read all the
journals and everything this is
available on Steam so it's available for
the PC also I believe xbox and mac and
that's our thing but but none of none of
you guys watching my channel care about
that and then and then finally a day too
 lazy linux as well and linux do
no no I was saying Mac okay yeah linux
too and then dan do you guys have any
estimated release date it's early next
year so sometime between between march
and april in the box below beautiful
March and April next year through the
woods here's a look at into stellaria
inter stellaria yes this was a game that
cut man because it reminded me of FTL or
faster than light which is a game that I
play both of these games have kind of an
8-bit style and you're out in space in a
spaceship this particular game in
interest ilaria launched a little bit
over a month ago on steam so it is
available right now it costs about 10
bucks and in the game you command a kind
of a small fleet of ships so it's not
just one like an FTL also the combat is
a little bit different than FTL in this
game there's a little bit more RTS
elements that seem like not as much
pausing these are actually a small star
field that you can use to maneuver your
ships around although there's lots of
automated stuff in the game to see can
you take your ships and then you tell
the AI to take control then you can also
actually go in and equip each of the
crew members on the ships with different
gear and weapons and then you can also
take the ships and like land them on
planets in kind of a platformer style
part of the game and that's where you
can go and refuel and resupply but the
games really all about like interstellar
trade and combat with other ships and
kind of they could expand in your image
across the universe that company I only
tried it out briefly but it was
definitely a lot of fun so check it out
it's available on Steam right now
so guys this area over here is they go
crazy it's crazy with games these are
all the triple a title so you got like
sasses Creed syndicate over there we
also have a rainbow six got the Ubisoft
booth you have 2k right here in front of
me which includes battleborn they have a
pretty fancy like statue thing going
very fancy
there's some other stuff too Bethesda's
like over in that direction and there's
other things in that direction and that
is the conclusion of my coverage of the
triple-a titles at PAX Prime thank you
for watching next up I'm checking out a
game called bombshell
yes bombshell is an action RPG it's
based on unreal
it's supposed to be coming out in the
fall time great so about three months
time
I got a chance to play this it's pretty
badass you play an independent mercenary
named Shelly AKA bombshell
and she's just a badass it's an RPG so
there are leveling up
I use them the game has something of a
horse perspective but then way that we
only thought it was forced perspective
Tamara dies you can actually sort of
adjust the camera angle all the way we
didn't exactly know how to do that some
other really cool things were just that
the voice acting is kind of over-the-top
hilarious we kind of start out trying to
rescue the president from the White
House and then alien today
I know secure little details like the
executions that you can do after you've
sort of
infinite animations for all those
critical
since I was able to jump into it first
on one point and it was just like holds
out the right the right the right mouse
button goes into slow mode then you can
just like level of bunch of aliens
that's pretty sweet too hey guys this is
being developed by 3d realms and then
see pics will work in the past so check
it out it's going to be available on
Steam of course it's also coming out to
her xbox xbox one playstation 4
and we asked him about linux support and
I said maybe
any case you can get on steam so keep
your eye out this one the curse the
curse gaming I'm all out of gum award
which means it's time to kick ass
guys Dylan he's got a nice shirt
look everyone it's stephen dim
wave to the cameras neva Deb
that's a nice way he's been
No
i watch me sweat
go
I
bad
you
it
don't say you guys a little bit about
this entire stormtrooper suit was
printed on a desktop 3d printer nothing
is something like a MakerBot or an
alternator something has a small 78 x 7
h build platform those credit in
quadrants you can kind of see if you
look at the suit up close and talking
together for many parts to helmet loans
each separate 3d printed parts but this
was kind of a project that I set out on
with a company called my mini factory
calm to see if somebody on the other
side of the planet just from a bunch of
pictures I took myself could 3d model a
suit that was form-fitting to my very
sexy body they see here and they were
very successful and doing that he took a
series of about 200 pictures from around
me above and below where a very very
tight clothing my dad my neighbor's
backyard near azusa it's quite the
experience for them but from those
pictures they were able to create
something called a scatter map and
ultimately extrapolate a 20 model of my
body and then they model this armor over
that body literally cut it into segments
and made holes for pins that align the
parts and every single thing you see
here with exception to the visor was
actually printed on that printer and
it's all assembled just using like a
garter system off a belt with some
strapping it's a Velcro well everyone
that wraps it up for pax prime 2015 i
haven't had a fantastic weekend all
weekend and i hope you guys have enjoyed
my coverage stay tuned for more of my
regular content on pulse hardware and
we'll see you all very very soon
