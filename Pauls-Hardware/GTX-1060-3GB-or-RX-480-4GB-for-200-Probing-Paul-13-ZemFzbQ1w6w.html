episode number 13 and this is my baker's
dozen episode this is my Q&amp;amp;A segments I
do it every month and I answer the
questions that you guys ask in the
comments section which many of you many
of you have done from last month which
was episode number 12 and we can see all
the times I've done this segment in the
past I've been doing this for like over
a year now that's crazy but let's
actually just dive right into it with
the first question for mr. Shaw I'm
looking at a new $200 GPU should I get a
GTX 1063 gig or an Rx 484 gig that's a
very good question and one that I'm sure
lots of people have since $200 is a
pretty popular price to pay for a GPU at
least when you're looking at a slightly
more budgets or more towards the budget
end-rig if you're not going to be
spending 3 or 400 bucks but I do want to
point something out to you guys this is
an article it's linked in the
description we talked about it on the
live show on Tuesday AMD is working on
some refreshes of their current GPUs and
according to this rumor article on WCC F
Tech so a whole barrel of salts to go
along with this but they have an Rx for
580 and RX 570 both are rebrands as the
polaris GPUs at the 480 470 and 460 or
based on and they're saying it's been
postponed until April 18th in this
article so if that is truly the case and
if the article is true at all then the
580 and 570 might be providing higher
clock chips and they also might be
dropping the price of an 8 gig 580 which
would be equivalent to an a cake 480
just a little bit faster down to $200
and that might be about a month away so
again all this is rumors so it's hard to
bank on it too much but you might
consider hanging out for a month or so
because right now you got to pay about
250 bucks for a gtx 1066 gig and you got
to pay the 230 to 254 and RX 488 gig i
would definitely recommend getting the
larger memory capacity if that's
something that's that you can afford if
you can fit it in the budget so I'd look
for a cheap rx 488 gig right now or hang
out for a month or so see if AMD does
release those rebrands and
maybe you'll have some better options
for you you might even see Nvidia
respond with a price drop on the sin 60
so that then you'd have an option right
there if you're just trying to choose
between AMD and NVIDIA consider your
monitor if you're ever thinking about
doing g-sync or freesync you might lean
towards AMD at that lower end of the
budget because the monitors you can get
free think tend to be a lot less
expensive thank you for the question
though
next question from Tarun Amex Tarun Amex
three weeks ago are they're still going
to be lower and then CPUs and the answer
here will be yes and a lot of you guys
might be already familiar with this but
let's take a look at it real quick
this just dropped a couple days ago and
he has released information about the
rise and 5 CPUs they should be available
for sale April 11th so just under a
month away it's going to be available
for $169 so there's the whole product
stack right there a 1400 1500 X 1600 and
1600 X these are also based on the same
dies as the Rison 7 so they're going to
have cores disabled but we're told
they're still going to be using both CCX
units so there's still a lot of
questions as far as performance goes and
particularly gaming performance and that
kind of thing but yes to answer your
question yes and you have quad cores as
well six cores with SMT multi-threading
to give you eight threads or 12 threads
for pretty reasonable prices so I feel
like I can at this point without having
tested or put my hands on these CPUs at
all say these will probably be pretty
good options for multi-use computing
we're definitely going to be hidden
these pretty hard with the gaming
benchmarks because that was one of the
shortcomings and CPU limited situations
with the rise in seven CPUs and since
these are definitely geared more towards
the lower budget CP lower budget systems
the gamers might be more interested in
the gaming performance particularly at
lower resolutions where you can become
more CPU bound is going to be a pretty
important question so yes yes is the
answer to your question and give us a
few weeks until hopefully we can give
you guys some reviews on those and talk
about the performance next question from
yummy Frank C Paul what difference does
a tip set make also a good question if
you're not familiar with chip steps and
how they work and what they do there's
actually many different answers
to this question it's not just simple
here is exactly what they do I mean the
chipset gives you a bunch of additional
input and outputs so you can have what's
called the PCH the peripheral controller
hubs that's part of the chipset that can
control stuff like SATA ports and that
kind of thing on the intel side your
chipset will determine whether or not
you have unlocked overclocking support
or overclocking support for unlocked
case cube processors so if you have a
7700 K for example CPU then you've got
to have a z170 or is the 270 chipset
motherboard in order to overclock it the
lower-end chipsets on n cell don't allow
for overclocking and II of course has a
bunch of of things as well so here's a
quick chart of that if you want to check
it out and I know this looks a little
complex so I'm not going to go through
all of it right now
suffice to say the high-end chipsets are
generally going to be in more expensive
motherboards and have the vast array of
features or basically all the features
that are available for the platform so
like with X 370 on the AMD side you are
able to split your PCIe lanes for
graphics cards to one by 16 and 2 by 8
which will give you support for SLI or
crossfire 2 way also for USB you might
get more USB 3.1 ports Gen 2 USB 3.1
gen2 on ports USB 2.0 ports you can see
the number of those all the way down
line the number of SATA and nvme devices
it can be attached the number of SATA
Express devices it can be attached those
are stupid so don't worry about those
PCI Express SATA raid all that kind of
stuff so pay attention to those charts
look at your budgets and what your CPU
is supposed to do and what you want to
do with your computer by and large you
can get away with the higher-end
chipsets if you start getting into the
more budget options is where you start
to really kind of see features disappear
and you might not get something that you
might want like say you want support for
raid 10 or something like that again
though there's lots of variances so
there's no quick and easy answer to this
but if you do want some additional
viewing material I'll post the link in
the comment form I should you get a
budget chipset motherboard which is gosh
a couple years old now but still very
relevant
I even had well look that's like my
before I built my set out on my tables
and everything I get o it looks horrible
anyway hopefully
should help you out though next question
from macro and micro Boone do you still
use third-party antivirus or
anti-malware software and why or why not
I would love to say no I don't my
initial response was going to be no I
don't and the reason why not would be
because I've been using the Internet for
quite a few years now since since the
internet became something that the
public had access to since since AOL AOL
days let's put it that way and I've just
gotten used to when browsing you know
the shady stuff is often very evidence
you know when you click on something and
you get a big pop up that like starts
giving you an alert that like you have a
virus if you have to click here and go
here to fix it or whatever like I know
that's BS and I'm just going to like
close out that window or you know you
know that kind of thing and that usually
doesn't happen because usually I don't
stray into the shadier parts of the
internet but you know you can that can
happen you can click an arrant link or
something like that so when I thought
about this again as I actually
anti-malware for sure and malwarebytes
is far and away my favorite for that
that the basic version is free it's
constantly updated it's really good at
getting in there and rooting out stuff
that might have infected your system
particularly when it comes to malware so
I usually want to have a new system
don't have any antivirus stuff installed
I'll use a system for awhile if
something happens it seems fishy to me
then I'll usually get malwarebytes if
I'm really suspicious I'll boot into
safe mode and run malwarebytes there and
that can usually get rid of most stuff
that's not like too too terrible as far
as having infected your system but yeah
that should hopefully answer your
question next question from Thomas s
what are some tips for people getting
into custom water cooling funny you
should have asked this question a few
weeks ago because my most recent video
posted just the that yesterday is about
arctic panther my water cooled system
that I built in 2015 which used to be
back here behind me has been relocated
to the computer room and I have been
using the crap out of it but I also
neglected to do the proper service and
maintenance on it so that would be my
biggest tip right now for people getting
into custom water cooling is either
don't put any additives
or opaque fluid or anything like that
into your liquid itself if you want
something that's going to run for a long
time and not require more maintenance or
if you do go that route which I
understand there's there's definitely
some aesthetic appeal and like the
opaque fluid and that kind of thing and
that's why I did it and I knew I knew I
was doing it that adding that stuff to
it was going to potentially lead to I
don't say problems but just it it's
going to require more maintenance down
the line
I'd neglected to do that you should
definitely flush your loop every six
months regardless and especially if
you're using something like opaque fluid
beyond that I would just say generally
speaking with water cooling with custom
water cooling don't do it if you're on a
strict budget your money will much be
much better spent getting higher-end
hardware like don't water cool gtx 1060
for example just sell it and get a gtx
1070 or 1080 you'll get more performance
that way also I only typically recommend
water clothing if you've built the
system that's really high-end that's
kind of reaching towards the bleeding
edge of performance and only way you can
get better performance is by water
cooling it and overclocking it more or
something like that you can also be a
great option if you want something
that's really quiet because if you have
a lot of radiators and slow-moving fans
and you have that if your fin density is
low so that the air can flow through
that can flow through easily then you
can end up with a very cool running and
very quiet system but yeah watch that
maintenance and if you want more on that
if you give if you didn't check it out
already I will also post a link to this
video restoring arctic panther part of
the epic arctic panther playlist you
guys check that out so it's been it's
been good so far
ok next question from a I'm going to
call you craps gaming because your
actual username is just some letters and
numbers Paula what age did you start
building computers and what happened to
your first computer so I guess I would
say 14 although that wouldn't be
strictly speaking building a computer
when I was about 13 or 14 I remember my
dad and I went and got a huge pack 'red
486 DX based computer you know is one of
those desktop ones base box with the CRT
monitor on top and everything
and that was 14 and then after using it
for a while I did a ram upgrade on it
and that was a that was my first dipping
of my toe into the actually building
your own computer thing I wasn't I was I
think 16 that I actually went to fries
and bought a bare-bones system and then
got the rest of the pieces to like
install everything and built what was my
own computer that was just mine and I
sort of I guess I sort of put it all
together myself even though it was a
bare-bones system from price although
again we had a Commodore 64 that doesn't
really count quite as much for building
computers what happens in my first
computer it's probably got recycled at
some point again that was at 46 46 the X
system and it's just that was a really
long time ago and I'm not really sure
what happened to it at this point yeah
if I could go back I probably might have
kept at least that first one for just
for nostalgia sake but but I didn't so
so there it is but thank you for your
question craft gaming and next is Juna
new tnen Knut junik new UNIX new tnen
how do you whitelist channels I'm asking
because a friend of mine wants to know
well your friend is a very nice person
if they're interested in whitelisting
and let me let me walk you guys through
it real quick if you're interested and
this is particularly for adblock so I've
actually already set it up on this let
me bring it down so you can see I got a
little green some mark right there
for adblock so the way you do this is
you got to go into a block if you just
open up a block it'll it'll give you
options for enabling or disabling
adblock on a specific page or on a
domain but you don't want to have to go
and do that for every single YouTube
video and if you don't want to add white
list the entire YouTube website which
I'm guessing a lot of you probably don't
then yeah you have to do this basically
you got to go into settings there's an
extra checkbox there in the settings
menu to specifically whitelist
individual YouTube channels this is with
standard adblock by the way so just go
ahead and click that reset or restart
your browser and then you should be able
to pull that back up go in there
whitelist the YouTube channel and then
any page that is associated with that
YouTube channel whether it be the
channel page like a watch page as a
channel page or anything like that you
you'll still see the ads and that means
I will
we'll get a little bit of money from you
watching those ads and and I'm very
grateful to you guys for that of course
if you just want to run at Buckeye like
I really don't mind that either because
I understand how intrusive and annoying
ads can be at times but yeah that's how
you weightless at least with that block
Marmara zero four zero this is the last
question and one that was clearly quite
popular with all the thumbs ups that got
in the last video do you look at your
own poop before flushing it down of
course I do
it is a natural human instinct so look
at your own poop before or like after
you've done it and it's its built-in
because you look at it because if it's
like a strange color or something like
that or it looks really weird then you
know something's wrong like you got
something with your intestines maybe is
tighter or you've been eating the wrong
food or perhaps you should stop drinking
until you pass out every single night
that might be something to take into
consideration so Marv Marv yet to answer
your question very specifically I do but
guys that's all for this episode of
probing fault thank you so much for
probing me and of course if you guys
want to ask me questions to be answered
next month please leave those down in
the comment section down below while
you're edit hit thumbs up button and
that's all thanks for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
