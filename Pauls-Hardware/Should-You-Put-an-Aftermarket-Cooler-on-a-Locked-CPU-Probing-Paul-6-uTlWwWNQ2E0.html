to my monthly Q&amp;amp;A series it's called
probing Paul this is episode number 6
and it's where I answer your guys's
questions that you ask me each month so
last month we took a look at AMD vs.
Nvidia that's actually been a running
theme for a while
you can see all the history of probing
Paul's going back through that's like
looking through the sands of time anyway
all of these questions from today came
directly from the YouTube video that I
posted about a month ago and I usually
post these at the end of the but so this
is the one for July starting off with a
question from Isaac Embry basically says
he's got a hard drive with Windows
installed he wants to get an SSD and
switch his operating system over to the
SSD from the hard drive how do you do it
what's a good way Isaac a very good
question this is something that lots
people if you haven't done it already
you probably should do at some point my
first recommendation would be to not try
to copy your old operating system onto
the new SSD instead remove your drives
from the system pop the new SSD in get a
fresh install Windows installed on there
the reason I do this is we recommend
this is because I think it's a very good
habit to get into to know how to
reformat a system because if you ever
get a virus in the future anything like
that it's just the best means of virus
removal wipe everything reformat if you
don't want to do that I'd recommend
looking into an SSD that has
full-featured backup or imaging software
usually those are based on a Cronus
shroomish in my experience you can buy a
Cronus true image for one single license
for 30 bucks but that might be a little
bit expensive
there's tons of SSD manufacturers though
who include data migration utilities
with their SSDs I know like ocz does I
think Seagate does crucial does samsung
has their SSD magician' utility which I
think uses a crown of stupid if it
doesn't it still works pretty well
samsung's SSD SSD magician is actually
pretty good one Kingston Kingston is
another one who I know uses it and that
will get you the most easiest means of
transferring over question number two
comes from Nathan Mitchell uh when do
you think the new Ti and Titan level
cards will be coming from Nvidia do you
think it's possible we'll see a Pascal
GPU with a core clock over two gigahertz
we are getting close to that when it
comes to Pascal GPUs
here's the Titan X that was just
recently announced it is the Titan X
Pascal addition or Titan XP depending on
how you want to call it this is actually
supposed to launch in just a few days I
think I think on August 2nd so it's
supposed to come out yet on its Pascal
based and it's got all the super
high-end features and everything it's
really expensive though 1,200 bucks
most gamers are going to be holding out
for a 1080 Ti that has not been
announced there have not been many
rumors on that we really don't know any
solid information except that since
there's a Titan X you can reasonably
assume based on prior launches from
Nvidia that there will be a lesser
slightly lesser version of the Titan X
or the Titan X Pascal version that will
be the 1080 Ti usually it means they
overclock a little bit faster but maybe
doesn't have quite the full complement
of CUDA cores sometimes it has less
memory but they only use 12 gigs for the
Titan X I was kind of expecting 24 so
yeah tight 1080 Ti is definitely
probably going to be the top end of this
range when it comes to both performance
as well as being reasonably priced if
that can be used when it comes to
high-end video GPUs but um yeah Titan X
is I know I get less excited when it's
just so expensive
mattias or mattias I'm sorry if I'm
pronouncing that wrong asks well he's
from Argentina hello to Argentina he has
played have I ever played World of
Warcraft yes way too much I think he's
thinking about buying a GPU doesn't want
to know which ones the best choice he
just plays Wow basically if you're just
playing wow then look for the cards that
are being marketed towards MOBA gamers
you know like like League of Legends and
that kind of thing because those games
typically require a lot less GPU
horsepower and Wow is fits into that
category for sure if you're looking for
new cards because if you are buying a
new card if you're buying a graphics
card I find going towards the newer ones
is often a good way to do it
1060 would be a good option but probably
a little overpowered for what you need
480 would also be a very good option
also probably overpowered for what you
need in AMD has just announced but not
launched yet the 470 and 460 GPUs I bet
those will be really good choices for
you new architecture newer hardware and
you'll probably get a lot of bang for
your buck out of those you could also
look at buying slightly older used cards
like gtx 970
now we're going for a lot less than they
used to especially if you look at it I
used one or something like that and even
kind of mid-range to low-end cards from
invidious or from AMD side you know now
that the new generation of cards is
coming out so like a 370 or something
like that could also be an option
next question from Hank Wallace he's
asking what is your setup for the
overhead camera that you use from time
to time how is it suspended and what
camera is it good question Hank I will
show you it's great here all right so
this is this is completely just rigged
out of pieces and parts that I had lying
around so this is just a big old seat
clamp I think I got that for Christmas
back when we moved into the house and I
was like I need tools clamps got to get
got a guy give him the clamps attached
to that is this which is like a little
piece of something that was came from
lighting something I don't even know but
it's got a little so I used that to kind
of attach it to the clamp then I have
this piece which is I think part of a
tripod that actually has a 3/8 3/8 inch
threaded thing on that and that goes to
a little ball head so I can actually
adjust it around so this thing's really
janky but I can attach it to any of my
overhead two-by-four games since I have
this framework going on up above me if
you want to see more of that check out
my garage work log series because I have
all the stuff I've built in here I have
documented over the years over the last
couple years that I've been doing it
anyway so that's how I mount it I do
have a couple other options and I am
trying to get something a little bit
more permanent I want to get a few more
just these little ball heads and just
mount them up there permanently set
enough to keep moving this thing around
lately if I need to feed video over to
the computer I'm just using my second
camera since I have two Panasonic Lumix
gh4 s really good cameras I use this
lens on it which is the Panasonic 12 to
35 because it's small and lighter
weights then my other lenses which
aren't readily available but those are
much heavier this is pretty heavy for
this configuration not gonna lie I get a
little nervous about it I make sure
everything's tightened down but this
does have a very clean HDMI out it's the
same HDMI out I'm using to record with
right now other than that I will also
sometimes throw my lx100 up there
because this has a time-lapse feature
built into it so I will run that or I
will take a webcam like the one that's
right back there
and I can also attach that up there be
that over in due time
coverage as well next up uptown NYC asks
did Paul do tech videos for new ag-1
points I guess he's asking to the
audience not me but I will answer
nonetheless yes I did used to do new egg
TV videos it's been almost 2 years now
since I left new egg but if you guys
want to check out an old new egg TV
video that's one of my favorites try the
golden build I'll post this link down in
the video's description this is me and
Kyle and it was z77 build this is back
in 2012 December 2012 and I this was
just a fun build the build itself turned
out pretty nice we did a little bit of
custom painting on the card it's really
early stuff when it comes to painting
and then Kyle gradually transitions over
the course of the video to Mister bling
and you know he gets all the gold
suddenly as a gold shirt on and and he
just he turns into a pimp by the end of
it so um there's there's Kyle you know
doing is doing the pimp Kyle thing
anyway everyone ever go check that video
out it's it's still funny it's got long
legs txm asks will you do a review of
the rx4 72 yeah so well at least I
intend to I don't know of any that are
on their way soon and I think they're
actually launching pretty soon I don't
know my communication with AMD has been
kind of like it they get a lot of
communication and then it falls off for
a while I haven't been talking to anyone
about the four 60s and four 70s in the
near future I mean I plan to cover them
but you know you got to work with people
and get samples and all that stuff even
if I don't get a sample project by one
but anyway still waiting on some
follow-ups for that I suppose even Evan
even Evan McClelland asks would you
recommend putting an aftermarket CPU
cooler on a non K CPU I have an i-5 6500
not sure if I should get acquire and
more efficient cooler or just deal with
the stock man or stock one cheers man
love your work thank you Evan
appreciate that and yes I don't
necessarily recommend getting an
aftermarket cooler for you know like a
6500 or something like that but that's
not to say it won't do you any good the
stock heatsink fans that ship with Intel
processors in particular are you know
functional they get the job done but
especially over time the fans usually
start to gum up they're not using those
nice of a bearing in there they tend to
get louder over time and they are not as
efficient of coolers
I wouldn't recommend spending more than
30
someone because you know doing that is
you're going for overclocking
performance and you're not really going
to have that with a non not unlocked CPU
there's a couple that I like Zalman's
CMPs 5x Performa I've used a few times
26 bucks on Amazon right now it's got
some copper heat pipes and it's got a
little fluid I think it's a fluid
bearing fan anyway it said something so
fluid
it's got fluid in there something that
makes it better okay also really easy to
install especially on AMD and it uses
the existing mount so there's no
backplate for it so also nicer if you're
not overclocking because you don't have
to worry about quite as much about
having a ton of pressure on the CPU
here's another one from arctic freezer
arctic freezer 7 it's just one has tons
of good reviews 20 a little over $20 so
these are going to get you your cool
down your CPU which isn't as big of a
deal but they will be quieter for you
and they'll have long they'll stay
quieter longer the Johnny Taunton show
asks Paul should I buy a current gen AMD
CPU or wait for the hyped Zen well
Johnny Taunton show that is a very good
question as the eternal question at
least until Zen actually launches we
just saw some news just this past week
that Zen's expectations have kind of
been pushed back even a little bit more
yes they are still supposed to launch in
2016 by the end of the year but it's
probably not going to be a wide release
there's probably going to be a ton of
the chips available they're talking
about q1 or q2 2017 more likely so I
would I would recommend wait for a m4
because that's going to be the new
platform it's going to be a new socket
none of the old CPUs or ApS are going to
work with it you're going to need to buy
a new one anyway but if you wait for
that which I'm hoping comes earlier this
year rather than later
you can least get that new platform even
if you get a an AP or something based on
the last generation you should be able
to drop in a new Zen CPU once they're
available all right that is my last
question I want to finish here by saying
if you guys want to send me anything
Paul's Hardware peal box for 3 to 5 down
bar California 9 1 765 is where you can
send that stuff to and I'm always
appreciative of steps that we get even
if it gets us in trouble by showing it
on the live stream because it's an adult
toy don't send any more of those because
we've been told we can't show them so we
will not elect get your proper amount of
appreciation speaking of
this computer next to me which I wasn't
speaking of but I must say it anyway
look at this computer next to me I just
built it working on some testing and
stuff for that so if you are not already
subscribed to my channel hit the like
button stay tuned because I going to
have a follow-up on this one very soon
in the next couple days and yeah I hope
you guys have enjoyed this video and
learned a little bit of something new
have a good one I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
