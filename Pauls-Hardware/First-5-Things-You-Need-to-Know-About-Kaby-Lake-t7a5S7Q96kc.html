lake aka the seventh generation Core
processor line which has CPUs that start
with sevens instead of sixes and a whole
new motherboard series and this CPU
right here this is the core i7 7700 K
the successor to the 6700 K and to
familiarize you guys with what's new
about it I thought I'd start off with a
quick and simple first 5 video so here
are the first 5 things that you need to
know about KB Lake thing one is skylake
similarities first you're going to
notice a lot of similarities between 6th
gen skylake and 7th gen KB Lake you've
still got the same CPU socket for both
LGA 1151 and they're still going to be
using ddr4 memory unlocked 91 watt TDP
quad cores are still available in the
7600 K without hyper threading and the
7700 K with hyper-threading and unlocked
CPUs still won't come with a stock
heatsink fan it's still manufactured on
a 14 nanometer process and the
microarchitecture is also still the same
albeit optimised more on that when I get
to thing number 2 and this is still
intel's mainstream product line meaning
that more powerful hardware including 6
core and greater cpus is available to
those who can afford it on intel's
enthusiast platform with Broadwell ECP
use and x99 chipset motherboards with
the LGA 2011 - 3 socket similarities
between KB link and skylake may even
creep over into their performance but
for that I encourage you guys to check
out my benchmarking video you can click
the card right up there and if it's not
up right now it will be up later today
neither tick nor talk Intel's tick tock
product cycle is officially dead with KB
Lake replaced by the less catchy
three-phase pa-o method so back in the
mid-2000s when AMD's original FX line of
CPUs was kind of kicking intel's ass
they started tick tock where every year
they launched a new CPU line tick ears
were for processed shrinks that made
everything on the CPU smaller
effectively and usually more efficient
and talked years were for
microarchitecture updates Keo has three
parts
P is for process which replaces tick a
is for architecture which replaces tock
and O is for optimization which means no
die shrink or new architecture but
optimization of the existing CPU design
they
ready did this kind of back in 2014
before formalizing it as PA Oh when they
Devil's Canyon line of CPUs launch that
were sort of a new line of CPUs but were
really just a refresh of Haswell as well
was a talk in the cadence based on new
22 nanometer microarchitecture and
launched in 2013 making has whoa refresh
and optimization in 2014 it was neither
a take nor talk and then Broadwell was
the tick again a process shrink to 14
nanometer rod well is just a little
weird because it launched like a few
days or a week before skylake and it
wasn't really widely marketed so that's
why it's often overlooked skylake
launched in august 2015 with new
architecture which would have been a
talk and now kb lake is an optimization
so maybe next year the whole cycle can
begin one more time new z2 70
motherboards so what is new with kb lake
there are some new things starting with
the motherboards 200 series of
motherboards with the predictably named
z2 70 chipset being the full-featured
option that enables unlocked
overclocking of your PB Lake case cube
processor the chipset now provides for
more pcie 3.0 lanes up to 24 total for
high-speed i/o including obtain support
now but more on that in thing for Intel
Rapid Storage technology can also
support up to three m2 PCIe devices now
with Gen 3 by for connectivity so I've
already spotted more m dot two slots on
these z2 70 boards most of them have at
least two now which is kind of nice
beyond that it's just a whole new line
of motherboards so there's a ton of new
designs from the big manufacturers up
there I have msi gigabyte and asus
versions on me so far even more RGB LEDs
than ever of course and hopefully this
time around someone makes a good mini
ITX motherboard that doesn't require
end-user modifications to look halfway
decent obtain if you've heard of intel's
new storage technology you probably know
that it's supposed to be super fast and
crazy durable while not being a storage
tech we're currently familiar with so
it's not manned but further details are
still murky at best it's shaping up to
be additional system memory that sits
between the CPU and system memory and
the rest of your storage array so kind
of like a big fast cache for your hard
drives or SSDs but also blurring the
line between what storage the operating
system can address at any given point in
time and Intel says the
like CPU platforms with the requisite m2
slot are obtained ready wait is that
good news or bad news obtained products
aren't expected until much later in 2017
but if KB Lake is obtained ready does
that mean that other platforms from
Intel aren't like skylake and the 100
series of motherboards even or the
enthusiast x99 masterrace god forbid now
I know implementing a game-changing
technology like obtain might leave some
platforms behind an Intel says that the
extra 4 PCIe lanes on the 200 series
chips at i/o are specifically therefore
obtain support but it's hard to see
skylake being left behind if all it's
really needed is a PCIe m2 slot and
enough bandwidth or especially abroad
well ECP use that has at least 28 PCIe
lanes available at minimum we need more
info on this to be sure but given that
Intel is already working with Microsoft
and Netflix on another initiative to
lock you out of 4k Ultra HD content
unless you have a 7th gen CPU Windows 10
and the edge browser I mean just look at
this helpful chart they made showing the
things that you actually do physically
need to stream 4k such as a 4k panel and
enough bandwidth and source material and
the extra things if they apparently get
to force upon you and force you to use
as well yeah yeah Microsoft who doesn't
need another reason to use edge and
surely skylake processors don't have
enough horsepower to push a 4k signal or
decode an HEV see anyway skylake
processors have an HEC HEV C decoder in
them
AMD better have a good response to this
4k nonsense but anyway my point is I
wouldn't be surprised knowing that that
Intel might also want to force you to
buy new stuff if you want to use obtain
as well they say there is an unlocked
dual core patience is required though
the 7350 K is thin v and I felt it
needed some air time since it is
decidedly different from the typical
7600 K and 7700 case cues that were
pretty familiar with the 7350 K is an
unlocked KB Lake dual-core CPU with
hyper-threading so 2 cores and 4 threads
and a base clock of 4.2 gigahertz it's a
bit of a throwback to the G 32 58 and an
anniversary edition the cpu the dual
core without
worth reading that they did on the
Haswell line the 7350 que has a four
megabyte cache 60 watt TDP and it should
be a nice option for budget builders who
want to overclock but don't want to
spend well over $200 for their CPU 1000
unit pricing for the 7700 K is three
hundred and thirty nine dollars per CPU
and the 7600 K is two hundred forty two
dollars per CPU that's from Intel just
FYI unfortunately the current bulk
pricing for the 70 350 K is listed at
168 US dollars per 1000 units so it's
not nearly as awesomely priced as the
anniversary edition ones which was less
than 100 bucks you'll have to wait a bit
longer to check out the 73 50 K though
Intel has about forty seventh gen
products that they're launching this
week but the 73 50 K won't be up for
sale until the end of January or
possibly early February and that's all
five things there's still a lot more to
talk about with KB Lake though such as
how does it perform and how does it
overclock I have a performance testing
video with the 7600 K and 7700 K it will
be posted in just a few hours and of
course linked if it's posted already I
also have a motherboard video with JJ
from Asus that will be up later today we
go over a ton of the new Asus boards and
CES coverage is coming at you all this
week so there are many many exciting
things to kick off 2017 just now if you
have any thoughts on this launch though
