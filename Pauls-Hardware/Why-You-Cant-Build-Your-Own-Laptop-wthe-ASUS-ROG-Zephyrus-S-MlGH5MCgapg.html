learn more what's up guys how's it going
welcome back to Pauls hardware today I
have JJ back in my garage one more time
that's going JJ I'm doing good man
excellent JJ offered to come back
because he wanted to show off some
laptops and I had this question that
popped in my head that I've been asked a
lot of times and maybe you guys have
asked at home which is why can't you
build your own laptop I build my own
desktop computers all the time and aside
from a very niche area where you can get
some laptops that have some upgrade
possibilities it's really impossible now
this video is gonna be about telling you
guys why it's impossible it's not going
to be about telling you guys how to
build your own because it's probably not
going to be a thing we're gonna be
featuring this new laptop from Asus
which is the asus rog Zephyrus actually
the Zephyrus s a new laptop in the
Zephyrus line it's got the six core
intel Kaktovik processor in there as
well as a bunch of design work that's
been built into it in order to make it a
functional gaming laptop without like
overheating and melting I guess so it's
the world's thinnest gaming laptop and
that in itself I think is really the
reinforcement of what you're talking
about is that when you talk about thin
and when you talk about high performance
they're generally exclusive and that's
what we're hopefully gonna be able to
give you guys some insight into is that
how do we achieve being able to have
this level of performance and something
that is essentially you know point 7
inches in terms of the at its thickest
point and you know four point six pounds
it is very thin and with the amount of
hardware in here which obviously
generates Heat different techniques have
been developed in order to help
dissipate that heat and the original
zephyrus which is a max cue laptop which
is a standard that NVIDIA has developed
to make sure that their laptops made for
gaming with Nvidia graphics cards
integrated can operate at high
performance while not being incredibly
loud but can also be thin and light and
still function like a portable laptop
should so asus with the originals i
first had this design here where when
you actually lift the lid it sort of
creates some some gaps down at the
bottom it spaces out and that just
allows air and heat to dissipate from
under there I like what's been
with the cooling arrangement here
because you also have a bunch of intake
areas up here at the front I thought
that these were like exhaust and it was
gonna be kicking hotter up at you but
what some of the considerations that
have been gone in that have gone into
creating this design so actually I think
you talked about it already a little bit
is that one of the key hallmarks that
you have with the zephyrus is really
about being quote-unquote like a ultra
premium thin and light gaming laptop and
this has traditionally not really been
the case you could get kind of a certain
level of thickness a certain level of
performance but you couldn't really get
to this I think a region I think the
goal was always being sucked by pounce
and now we're not just going about sub 5
pounds right we're really being
definitely below that marker we're going
very thin
um but you don't want to compromise on
things like the rigidity you don't want
to compromise on the thermal performance
so how do we achieve that well you noted
one of the first hallmarks of the
Zephyrs is gonna be the active airflow
design and that's essentially when you
go ahead and you open up the unit so if
we go ahead and just drop down the panel
and we pull up you see that that expands
and once that actually expands that
allows us to bring significantly more
airflow into the system but that's
really only one element to this right as
we're bringing air flow in we also need
to have actually a large actually
thermal assembly or thermal solution and
actually we have actually the raw
thermal solution here which you can kind
of get a sense of how this has been
designed and developed so this
generation actually is quite a bit more
advanced than our previous generation
the original is our first only had to
actually heat sink assemblies and now we
have a total of four heat sink
assemblies 250 fins an advanced copper
framework that goes here so there are
shared heat pipes between the CPU and
the GPU but also still independent heat
pipe for the CPM GPU and even dedicated
heat pipe and actually thermal coverage
for the actual power circuitry so we've
tried to look at really every single
element to be able to ensure that the
thermal performance on stays
consistently Adar around about 80
degrees in some situations of the
ambient even cooler or if you're
leveraging the turbo performance option
mode within the fan setting profiles
you're gonna be able to get better than
that
but that's really the goal right is that
if you're gonna be putting in such a
high performance CPU a high performance
GPU you don't want to be throttling you
don't want to be losing that performance
even though you've got this thin and
light base design so then itself was
quite challenging because when you go
about something like this you have to
really look at the density of the fence
and 250 fins that we have in here so
there's a lot of fins in there and Eve
placement when you talk about
essentially all the air points that you
have here right you've got exhaust here
we've got intake that's gonna be here
right you've got a like she also exhaust
exhaust over here is that we even have
to carefully design the actual exhaust
here on these heat sinks to actually be
slightly angled invented at an angular
level and the reason why you want to be
able to have something like that is of
course is that if you're gaming and
you've got your hand let's say in this
position you don't want to seneschal
they have hot air creating sweaty hands
right because so any hands you know
you're you're trying to keep a hold of
your mouth and it's just gonna be a bad
situation all the way around
we had to carefully look at all these
subtle aspects and they really helped to
provide I think a much higher level of
performance and that's why we have this
quote-unquote non-traditional design
where you have of course the keyboard
brought out to the front so that allows
us to have significantly more intake
airflow which complements the entirety
of this thermal solution but you also
didn't get other benefits you know one
of the nice things about this type of
design is you have more of a desktop
stance where I can put my hand right
here it's resting against in the actual
table and it seems a little bit more
natural than sometimes having to throw
my hand all the way up here and then
have maybe my mouse hand outside here so
it just gives you a little bit of a
different kind of design and placement
that you got to get used to but you can
see that everything we've consciously
designed for a certain benefit a certain
value I was gonna mention especially
like if the laptop is heating up up if
you're playing a long gaming session or
something than having your hands off of
the keyboard yep it might help keep them
a little bit cool as well ya know
sleeping your hands cool this in this
area definitely is gonna be
significantly cooler because of the way
that we've done that design that thermal
solution and continuing on a thermal
solution before we go I think to some of
the other kind of design hallmarks that
we've got here is actually gonna be what
work that we've done here with the
actual fans themselves and so this is
something that's really quite complex
and challenging when you talk about
notebook based design and so I know when
we were talking about this just kind of
giving you a little briefing an insight
it was interesting because you were
asking me are the fans essentially the
same type of technology that you have in
the new latest generation not to offense
and the reason why we kind of brought
that up is that the actual fans
themselves are comprised of liquid
crystal polymer and you need the
rigidity of liquid crystal polymer
because we've got 83 fan blades that are
present here so these are 12 volt fan so
they spin at a significantly high love
our p.m. to be able to provide us more
airflow and more performance but when
you're essentially at that level of RPM
right you don't want to have actually
any misalignment or you don't want to
have any type of deformation that might
occur to the actual fan blade itself and
so that allows us to maintain a really
high level of performance so that's a
really cool design element that we again
had to kind of consider goes how can we
help to maximize that airflow
performance being provided to the actual
thermal solution and so that was
achieved by utilizing it and actually
the first efforts was the first notebook
ever to implement that type of design
technology and so we've continued on
with this generation
we've just increased the number of fins
compared to the original zippers which
was they believe 71 or 73 now we've got
83 so even more so you're saying that if
I wanted to build my own laptops that's
I probably just couldn't go and buy this
type of cooling solution off the shelf
correct
so the proprietary design it's it's made
in such a way that everything is packed
in very very close very tight but also
you have to have cooling efficiency
throughout so this is probably the main
reason why you couldn't you know buy an
empty frame leave looking like that and
install your own hardware but the flip
side is that you get the benefits of all
of this design work in engineering
that's gone into it so you can't have a
laptop that you can actually game on you
can take on the go that's you know it's
gonna get warm well it's why you're
gaming on it they're doing video editing
and stuff but it's also gonna dissipate
that heat and also direct it away from
you I ended that and actually speaking a
direction one of the other kind of cool
design elements that we had here is
again you know something that you might
not necessarily think about but people
think about like when they're building a
traditional system is managing dust
right and so even that's something that
we have to think about here because in a
lot of these situations you might not
actively be cleaning this unit so how do
you ensure that the thermal solution is
gonna maintain it's a kind of level of
performance over time and so we actually
had to create a specialized essentially
internal housing it's kind of a
self-cleaning design where through the
centrifugal force and the actual speed
that you have in terms of that
channeling effect for the air that as it
comes in there's actually a separate
channel that exists right here within
the actual fan housing that allows the
actual dust debris and particulate
matter so like dust debris dander things
like that will essentially be channeled
and exhausted outside the system as
opposed to resting internally inside of
that fan assembly where you said she
could be impacting the overall
performance of the thermal
Ellucian so so I've had I've had plenty
of people with laptops come to me asking
for help saying my laptop overheats and
I can't use it anymore and I'll often
find that you know if you open it up and
you find where the fan is and you find
where the heatsink is this is just caked
with dust is I get layer of dust there's
absolutely no air flowing through there
so I imagine that would help alleviate
that problem yeah definitely I mean
there's still always you're gonna want
to be cautious in mindful you know of
monitoring things but this is kind of
one of those things of trying to
implement something that helps to just
aid in ensuring better long-term
performance over time let's talk a
little bit about the actual manufacturer
of the chassis it runs the show we
actually have some sort of raw materials
here which I thought was fascinating to
look at so one of the cool things you'll
notice is that this being an RG product
it's really kind of a premium product a
much higher grade in terms of the
material composition so most of the time
on most gaming laptops you're gonna find
a lot of plastic but on this unit you're
gonna actually have the predominant
amount of metal that's gonna be on here
so aluminum and magnesium are pretty
much par for the course and this
actually entire lid is milled from a
single piece of aluminum which you can
actually see right here so we actually
have to use CNC machining for this to be
able to actually achieve this plate and
so this is actually an example of kind
of like what you have right here
hopefully it's not too too glossy right
there Danny it is shiny this entire
process to give you an example this one
essentially a billet it's gonna take
over about 70 minutes on a CNC machine
to be able to actually machine out this
one single piece then we have a dual
anodization process which goes through
to be able to give us different texture
as well as the Sham furred edges I mean
that two-tone anodization which also is
a nice little kind of gold hallmark that
you find on the RG series products but
even when you talk about other kind of
materials and construction you know we
flip this over and we talk about the
back of the unit this is gonna be a
magnesium plate that you're gonna have
here as well and that's done to be able
to have before something that's super
lightweight so this unit clocks in at
just a little bit over 4.6 pounds and
it's really about trying to strike that
balance of being able to maintain the
right level of rigidity and strength but
also still have something that is truly
light that when you throw it in your
backpack you don't feel like you're
really taking on you know a seven or
eight pounds that you might
traditionally have when you talk about
these higher end quote-unquote gaming
laptops cuz this is
very capable gaming a pop when you talk
about that 8th generation processor that
gtx 1070 max-q right it's a lot of
performance to be able to fit into this
type of design and I really like just
the contrast between these two pieces
this piece of aluminum or aluminium for
those of you over in the EU pretty
substantial pretty heavy it's so much
more lighter now that it's all milled
and you can kind of see some of places
here where the the CNC went through
milled out everything but still like I
mean this has a tiny bit of flex yeah
really not much at all and I just so
small little grooves in there yeah it's
a really impressive process on I think
it's you know just that attention to
detail to be able to provide that
quality so you know as we kind of like
take a look through here in terms of the
design constraints I mean what we've
kind of done here in terms of dealing
with the constraints of being thin and
light this had to be all one single
piece to be able to maintain rigidity
that's important because this even ties
into the excited experience that you
have when you talk about the the monitor
which is exceedingly well they the panel
that's used on this and that's important
because that's really one of the
hallmarks of this this is it has our
super narrow bezel design and this is
144 Hertz 3 milliseconds panel we
actually had to work directly with auo
who's actually a panel manufacturer and
have a very close relationship with asus
where would they even have to actually
work with another company called Merck
which helps actually make some of the
actual polymer material which goes
inside the actual LCD panel and to be
able to achieve essentially all these
operating specifications so right now
asus is the only company that you'll
find on the market that can offer you
144 Hertz with 3 to 3 milliseconds
response time so it's again this is kind
of one of those challenges to you know
if you were trying to build your own you
could do this you couldn't go directly
to a company a request hey I want this
ultra-low response time right you might
be forced to just get whatever is
available in the market and this is
something that we've done in the past
with like even our normal high end you
know independent monitors where we had
to Co work with the panel manufacturer
to create specifications that don't even
exist in the market and I think those
are two extremely desirable specs for a
gaming monitor whether you're talking
about a laptop or a desktop and the
really high refresh rate and the really
low response time yeah and we were
talking about bezels not you know
everybody has a different opinion but
it's nice to also be able to hang out
have it with a super narrow bezel based
design and effectively actually when you
talk about the overall volume or
footprint you've got this fifth
eighteen inch category base notebook but
in a 14 inch chassis so very impressive
in that regard and even in the
colorspace performance actually quite
nice 100% srgb coverage in terms of what
you have there so some cool stuff there
now one of the other things I think
might be interesting is if we take a
look here in terms of them down we move
down to the keyboard design and some
kind of how do we have to account for
doing things here even here again we
have to figure out how do we maintain I
think the the quality of experience so
again we go back to metal in terms of
the framing for the entire keyboard and
that's because essentially because you
have a much more compact space you want
to be able to have a good amount of
still structural rigidity present so
that as you're go ahead and depressing
those keys that they feel substantial
and that you can actuate clearly and
consistently and so even though
specialized technology here we have
called over stroke technology which
actually allows us to make sure that
it's 50 percent faster in terms of
actually that register in that
depression to be much more consistent so
that even though you've got to reduce a
little travel there right you're still
getting an overall good keyboard
experience have you turn the light this
has multi zone RGB lighting on the
keyboard so we should be able to go
ahead and open up on par or are you
actually new software we actually have
our G Armory software which is actually
be replacing our gaming center software
now just for some of you wondering you
know as you guys guys might get some
secondary shots here you do want to keep
in mind this is a engineering sample
okay so the final version of this
product isn't even gonna be a little bit
finer sharper and cleaner you know but
we're you know we're giving you guys a
first look preview right here in terms
of just kind of what's going to be
coming here so here you can see that
even though we've got this compact
keyboard you still get your four zone
RGB lighting and this course is fully
supported in terms of you source sync so
you can still synchronize this with
everything from our keyboards the nice
the headset even some of our external
Artem's like excuse me external items
like the RG spotlight or the ROG
terminal which allows you to even
connect us like a USB port and still
have LED strips for like your your desk
setup if you want to be able to do that
stuff so some cool things there and
we've got independent kind of layout
here for your primary function keys and
enlarged space bar based a set up in
terms of that and then of course you've
got the really interesting toggle based
design for the touchpad and the numpad
so you can toggle off the numpad when
you want it and when you don't want it
you're good to go and you still have
full scissor based switches for your
actual right-click in your left click
which is nice because sometimes on these
notebooks you especially and you go to
more compact sometimes you lose those
buttons altogether you just go with the
touchpad and you have to double press on
it or you don't have full actually
mechanical base switches for the right
click in the left click so I think that
in that regard you still have a really
really nice premium experience here yeah
I think if switches are an option I I
prefer having the physical switches
there but I do like the ability to pull
up the numpad there to your numpad is
like when you need it you're really
needed yeah it just makes things just
move and I think that's the key thing
here is that that's one of those design
challenges again you know if you're
probably trying to build your own being
able to develop something like this
which this again was kind of like a very
industry unique based design
implementation can be very challenging
and so that's always kind of the benefit
you know it's one of those kind of
things that some users find challenging
when you go about kind of the walled
garden approach of designing something
entirely internally but allows you to
really try to maximize your engineering
effort to be able to really design
something distinctive and innovative it
I think definitely when you look at
something like this is up for you you
know for a fact that is the case um some
other kind of cool updates that we've
got for this generation here in terms of
that RGB lighting is that we've also
extended that lighting effect to the
rear lighting which you might not be
able to see it as clearly appear on the
back of those two zones we'll also still
fully now support synchronization
control which our previous generation
Zephyrus didn't offer that
synchronization and control so you can
kind of tie it all together within that
people people need control over their
RGB LEDs yeah you definitely want it
you've got of course that RGB lighting
right here of course on the rgi as well
on that guy and from an audio experience
I know that this is kind of something
they were talking about there was a
little bit interesting as well so one of
the things here is um on gaming
notebooks as well a lot of times you
find that the speakers are gonna be
downward firing but actually here
they're actually directly placed within
the hinge base frame design and they're
actually front firing so we've got two
speakers there they feature a smart
amplifier and what that does this helps
us to monitor temperature of an
excursion um so that essentially makes
sure that we can monitor the overall
distortion level of the actual driver
and the the speaker this allows us to
maintain overall better just clarity and
a better experience when you have with
your speakers so they pretty much you
can go to the highest levels and you're
not gonna have to worry about blowing
out quote unquote the speaker which this
was a little bit more of a problem in
previous generations of notebooks if you
wanted to get too aggressive you could
have an issue
I mean a trying to kill the stigma of
laptop speakers yeah um you know I don't
think you're ever gonna go with it you
know when you talk about speakers in
general you know it's it's about mass
and it's about how big you can go so of
course this is not gonna replace you
know a high quality headphone or high
quality headset or external speakers but
I will definitely say that somebody who
meet like me who I think I really
appreciate audio it's definitely a
passable experience that's it's quite
solid um and it's got a good level
tonality but I think the cooler part is
actually what we've done on the software
side of the fence okay um so let's yeah
plug in yep let's go ahead and put it so
we're taking a look at software now and
this is probably another area that you'd
have a little bit of a challenge setting
up for yourself at home unless you're
into software development programming I
guess but having the software to play
nice with the hardware in order to
monitor temperatures increase or
decrease fan speeds as well as do
personalization stuff like changing
lighting sound configuration I'm
assuming all this is true right yes this
is entirely par for the course but I
think now the more interesting part here
as well as trying to kind of understand
how users use their headphones and the
different type of audio let's say
connected devices right and so what we
found is that we've always kind of
implemented I think a lot of a really
interesting sound technologies into our
notebooks as well as even on our
motherboards but traditionally they're
only going to be capable on an analog
base connection so if you have like an
analog headset or an analog headphone
you are good to go
but what happens if you're using a USB
headset a USB DAC and you're using VR
any of these other kind of pure digital
basis devices you were losing I think a
lot of them more customization options
you might have had available and so one
of the cool things that we've done with
sonic studio 3 eases Apo injection which
allows us to essentially be able to go
ahead and manipulate and customize still
all that even if you're utilizing a USB
headset or you're using VR or you're
utilizing a USB DAC you can still go in
and customize things so here you can see
we're in the interface we have different
presets so you can see you got music
movie gaming communication you got
things like smart volume voice clarity
bass boost treble you've got an
equalizer you can go ahead and customize
you can switch over to the advanced mode
which the advanced mode is cool because
you actually can have what we call
device routing and then per application
or per game based customization so
example like you're here is that if I
want I could go to say all applications
you can see all your different
applications you can assign what you
want the actual output to be on
in terms of the device in terms of what
it's it's gonna output the quote unquote
audio to and then from there you can go
ahead and customize let's say your
effects so you want to be able to set a
specific mode so whether it's like music
or gaming movies you want to customize
the EQ for each one of those you can go
ahead and apply all of those and you can
also do things like spatialization so if
you want to apply like reverb or like
surround sound mixing to any one of
those you can do that and that's per any
open application so you know if you were
going into a game
take for instance there is overwatch you
could customize override specifically or
yet browser you had discord or Spotify
whatever might be and go and make those
adjustments and same thing even for the
microphone which is pretty cool we have
this technology here you can see what's
called on my voice and direct monitoring
where we can do things like
post-processing we can stabilize volume
we can help to kind of improve voice
clarity minimize ambient noise
interference and this can the cool thing
about it is that it can work for
incoming and outgoing audio so if you've
got kind of friends that are talking to
you and you want to clean up their audio
a bit you can do that but same thing if
you're maybe audio needs to be cleaned
up a little bit or maybe you've got a
lot of you got your AC running you know
maybe in the same room that have got a
little bit of whites always right you
could leave that run in apply the actual
post-processing I'll tell you from what
I've tried it out it's actually pretty
good at really helping to eliminate
those kind of consistent tones that you
might have they're kind of more white
noise which are things like fans ACS
hums that you might just kind of have in
your environment it's a really nice
little software that's kind of built in
and I think we've all been like gaming
and that person comes on the voice chat
with like you know the five dollar mic
if they got at the Walmart bargain bin
or whatever and it just sounds horrible
and you just want to know that yeah you
can totally do that another option
besides just meeting them I guess yeah I
definitely you don't want to read your
fan especially if it's gonna be affected
yet your your opportunity in terms of
hopefully winning okay if you guys are
playing a more competitive kind of map
or sunshine ski so another big one is
and we won't touch on it too much but we
actually have a brand new software suite
that we call armory creat and so you
guys will be seeing a lot more of this
later on but this is actually a brand
new oversaw a software overhaul that
we're gonna have for asus rog based
devices so this will be your new kind of
front-end to be able to do everything
that you're talking about you can make
you know OneTouch adjustments so that if
you want to be able to quickly make
adjustments to your fan speeds you can a
you can switch from silent to balance
the turbo you can go ahead and see all
your frequencies your temperatures
you're gonna have per game profiles you
can do process cleanup so if you want to
go
and get rid of whole bunch of programs
at one time so you can free up all your
system resources you've got mobile
monitoring built-in so if you just want
to kind of be focusing on your game but
then maybe still see your temperatures
and other information or your smartphone
or your tablet or something like that
you can load it up kind of have it there
off to the side so that you can be
seeing your information in screen yes
that way sometimes if you also don't
want like an overlay that's running on
your system if you your overlays kind of
eating up some of your HUD space or
something like that you have to worry
about that how does it connect to the
smart phone Bluetooth this bluetooth
bluetooth based connectivity and you
mentioned our other energy products is
it's gonna be coming to the desktop as
well yes we won't go too much into that
but you'll definitely be seeing more of
our Marie crated in the future so you
definitely keep tuned that if you like
this interface and if you guys have
feedback on it definitely drop it in the
comments I'll do my best to definitely
try to pass that over to our team keep
in mind though that everything we are
talking about from the software in the
hardware this is an engineering sample
well most things are gonna be pretty
much complete there's always a little
sick kind of subtle things that there
might be some slight modifications for
the final launch yeah I'm here you know
issues are a sync like we talked about
allows you to go ahead and have that
control for your lighting for any kind
of supported accessories as well would
all show up in here as well we got you
know keyboards mice headset monitors
whatever it might be and then other you
know options to be able to quickly
launch you know things like xsplit our
game first packet variety software so if
you want to customize the experience in
terms of your network adapter for the
wireless or anything like that you have
that ability to be able to go ahead and
do all those things so a pretty nice and
comprehensive I think software suite in
here and most of the software suite
really I think that we focus on ROG is
going to be about trying to really
improve the overall gaming experience
and so a lot of that really translates
into one being about networking because
that's of course how you get online
player games and then on audio and here
you can see we are actually bringing up
the brand-new version this is game first
five but you can go ahead and and it
actually by default will automatically
detect the games that you have running
and attempt to auto prioritize that so
let's say if I was jumping to overwatch
it's gonna set overwatch automatically
as the highest based item and I will
send that prioritization so if I've got
other networks enter services I don't
have to worry about that but if I wanted
to I could go you know easy into manual
take for instance and you can go in and
you can manually set what you want to be
at a higher level and you can even have
different networking adapters
if you wanted to kind of change things
up you can go in and you can check your
monitoring information there's even cool
things like Wi-Fi analyzing built-in so
that if you want to check like which
channels or the right channels to
connect to you that's nice you can kind
of see that information you can see
which applications are using the most
bandwidth so definitely I feel that you
know it doesn't meet the the
quote-unquote adage of being bloatware I
think this is actually useful functional
software that I think an enthusiast and
a gamer would appreciate excellent
alright so several different software
options for you guys to control your
asus rog laptop I believe ginger you
brought another laptop though that we
might want to take a a quick look at I
did so we've actually got something
pretty special here so we're unveiling
another first and this is going to be
our 17 inch version of our Strix scar 2
and so um the scar series is really kind
of our series that has been focused at
kind of eSports gamers are kind of that
mid-range enthusiast so people that
really want to have hit that kind of
sweet spot in terms of bang for the buck
so they still want something that's got
great build quality high level of
performance eighth generation based
processor GTX 1060 in terms of graphics
cards still an extremely impressive
thermal solution you know still all that
same software that we've talked about um
you know over stroke technology um nice
high quality I think finishes here
you're not dealing with metal but we do
have actually a special 8 layer how it's
called IMR process which helps to really
add subtle textures and details into the
kind of the fit and finish and I think a
really immersive an impressive base unit
as well because this is going to be same
thing 144 Hertz 3 millisecond response
time thanks but with super thin bezels
as well so those super narrow bezels
they really add like a whole nother
level of additional immersion when you
talk about having a 17 inch but pretty
much in a 15 inch kind of body so I
think that was the other thing that we
kind of see is kind of something that's
similar between the zephyrus and the
Strix is kind of giving you a more
compact base laptop but still an
extremely high level of performance with
some really cool design element we're
talking as we were preparing for the
video that I used to have a CSG 73 which
is an old-school big old desktop
replacement and that was a 17 17 inch I
think 17.3 this by comparison is so much
smaller and also so much lighter ya
relative to that and you still got a
very nice size screen yeah and you know
you get a couple of course upgrades that
you would expect when you go to a bigger
chassis so you're gonna have a little
bit more
activity in terms of total number ports
you get an SD card slot as well as on
this unit which you wouldn't have on
this model now one thing that we didn't
also touch on in just kind of for some
of your wondering which is another
little cool point that we were talking
about Paul I know you've always had like
a little bit of an appreciation I think
for some Wi-Fi technology and stuff like
that likewise that both of these
actually feature the latest generation
Intel wave to a digital of an AC
wireless chipset built-in board and the
reason why that's important is because
if you have a multi-user mimo compatible
based router
these are multi-user mimo compatible
based clients so that can even offer a
higher level of performance on that
combined with the speed throughput of
the chipset means that you can
legitimately be seeing 500 600 700 800
megabits of wireless throughput so
you're talking you know 5 to almost 9
times the actual throughput of 2100
Ethernet almost true gigabit class Wi-Fi
um so if you're talking about low
latency um you know low ping and just
overall high performance wireless gaming
you can definitely achieve that with
these units and the other really cool
thing here on this Strix unit is it
features the specialized design that we
call range boosts where traditionally on
most notebooks you have a fixed number
of antennas um so it might be like a 2
by 2 antenna configuration this actually
features more than two antennas and the
benefit of that is what it does is it
helps the monitor kind of the location
and the signal strength and again it
could switch to the antenna that is
receiving better performance um so it's
a excusive technology in a cell for at
the same time but it just switches to
whichever one is physically and exactly
in a better location to give you better
performance so well it doesn't
necessarily have the same premium ultra
premium implementations that you're
gonna have here I've got something on
the Zephyrus s you still get a very
capable high performance high quality
based gaming laptop so some pretty cool
stuff I think you know if you're talking
about and hopefully you've gotten a
little bit more kind of an insight there
are definitely a lot of challenges when
you go about putting in this much
performance when you talk about the CPU
the GPU the layout for the keyboard
design you know the rigidity and all
those different elements on how you kind
of try to make them work you know all
holistically to be able to provide a you
know stable reliable and high
performance experience and it's a
combination of all those things it's not
just the thermal design it's not just
the panel design it's not just the
specification implementation there's you
know it's kind of some of the parts
experience kind of thing and if I can
ask you one last question that you might
not be able to answer as this year of
2018 progresses we're expecting some
upcoming launches on the CP
GPU side is it reasonable to assume that
these skews will be updated with that
updated Hardware if and when it becomes
available so I can't go too much into
essentially any products that haven't
been discussed or formally announced or
planned out but what I can tell you is
that these designs that you see here we
have designed essentially as kind of our
designs to move forward in the future
with and they do have Headroom support
for what might be coming down I think
that was a safe enough answer but
hopefully you guys know more about the
upcoming stuff from Asus JJ this has
been awesome thanks for stopping by
again no thanks for having me and
definitely I'd love to hear your guys's
feedback you know we know that always
there's a lot of different opinions on
what's the right design what's the right
ports what's the right type of
specifications but I think that we've
really done a great job of being able to
try to provide two outstanding
experiences you know something in that
mid-range and then something in the
ultra premium and the you know something
really impressive with this the world's
thinnest my gaming laptop here with the
Zephyrus s um and that's and that's
actually one last thing that I did want
to touch on that I think I did forget to
mention here that the zephyrus is really
formerly kind of part of a family of
products so some of you might be seeing
that there's others there first models
that's gonna continue to exist Zephyrus
is really all about defining the
expectation of what the best is in a
gaming laptop when it comes to that
ultra thin and light but gaming class
notebook category or a gaming class
laptop category so there are three
models you've got the traditional
zephyrus then the Zephyrs m and now
these are SS so each one kind of is a
little bit different than the other kind
of the S being the slimmest the am being
that balance of giving you the desktop
class GPU part with a little bit more
storage expansion and a traditional
keyboard layout and then the original
Zephyrus which has the non-traditional
keyboard layout like this base design
and a 1080 max-q base design but a
little bit thicker so each one kind of
two different users that are out there
there's the servers for you all right
well guys this has been a quick first
look at the quick quick probably isn't
the right word but an in-depth look at
the new asus rog Zephyrus s coming soon
they're actually coming soon or
available now coming very soon coming
very soon and also a quick look at the
asus rog Strix
Skaar - available right here 17 inch
variety guys thank you so much for
watching this video and hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed it and JJ
thanks again for stopping by today
thanks for army all right and we'll see
you guys next time
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
