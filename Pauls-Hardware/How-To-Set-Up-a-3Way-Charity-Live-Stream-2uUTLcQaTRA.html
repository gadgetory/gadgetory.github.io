pulse hardware today's video is going to
serve actually two maybe three purposes
the first of which as is hopefully
indicated by the table is gonna be how
to set up for a lengthy charity
livestream at twelve hour one in my case
we're gonna have a couple people here me
and Kyle set up as well as a third
position for a moderator and just
somebody to make sure nothing goes to
wrong so I'd be going over my setup
procedures for that but the second
reason is actually if you bet your
calendar right now and it's December 9th
which is when this video is going to go
live it's actually happening right now
this is charity livestream so you should
definitely check the link in the
description to go over and check out our
live streams over on Twitch we're gonna
be trip streaming to my twitch channel
as well as Kyle's twitch channel it
should be lots of fun playing games
raising money for charity third reason
is to say goodbye to my beer because
during the livestream I'm probably gonna
be shaving it up but we'll get to that
later anyway so let's quickly run down
the plan using my basic desk setup that
I have over here we're gonna have three
computers in use of course the main
streaming system over here which I'm
gonna have a wide camera set up showing
everything and I'm also hopefully going
to have a system 1 and system 2 being
captured by that so it can stream both
gameplay as well as audio and everything
out via one stream if people just want
to watch that we will individually be
streaming from our computers so I have
arctic panther set up over there that's
going to be my streaming system over in
that corner and have Kyle sit right here
and he'll be using the giveaway system
actually this is the system we're giving
away lovely picture of the rear end of
it but it's my entry-level thread Ripper
build it's about an $1,800 ish system
with a 1900 X and a 1070 TI in a
position that right here with Kyle
sitting here facing towards towards this
direction and then also have a
workstation setup here so that Joe our
editor or perhaps later on whyphy sauce
can sit right here to watch what's going
on on that system monitor chat and
everything hopefully maybe also set up
something going on in discord so I need
to make sure that both of the gaming
systems are set up with Steam logins and
have as many of the games loaded onto
them
as possible need to make sure the
streaming system is set up I'm going to
use a couple 1080 monitors for us to
game on so it's easier to capture over
there and make sure that that's
capturing properly to operate for the
mainstream and then of course I've got
to make sure everything is lined up for
the charity stream so we can take
donations and everything like that Kyle
is supposed to show up here 8 a.m.
tomorrow morning and then we're supposed
to start at 9 a.m. we'll see if that
actually happens or if we end up being a
little bit later than that but I think
with some appropriate prep today we'll
be in good shape but before any of that
I got to make sure we have supplies so
I'm gonna make a run for libations as
well as make sure we got some snacks
stop number one
so many decisions all right I tried to
keep things simple got some Stella
Artois a little bit later I got some
lost coast downtown Brown one of my
favorites I was like get brown and then
I got this delirium
Noelle by the makers of delirium tremens
so we'll give that shot and then of
course shimei at Albertson's now think I
never get this type of thing so this is
a good excuse to get this type of thing
like a coffee cake go for that I got a
card this time because I don't want to
make the same mistake at it last time or
I had to limit my choices when I came to
beer let's also look at these poppy seed
muffins though I don't want to test
positive for opioids or whatever
can I get some fruits and vegetables so
like apples what's your favorite kind of
Apple we got a green lady I don't know
what lady Alice's Golden Delicious over
here get Crips pink might go for that I
usually good for the blood Spink of it
all right I think my provisions are
taken care of
other than the alcohol of course by the
way I want to insinuate that you have to
have alcohol in order to do something
like this we're certainly not requiring
it and we're probably not going to break
into that stuff until good I would say
halfway through the stream if we were
smart about it but first off of course
we got at breakfast so coffee cake for
that as already mentioned next step
we're attempting to imply that we're
being somewhat responsible here that we
got vegetables and we got some naked
juice of course you know help reaps you
know give us back needed things that's
that's in there no sugar added I mean
come on got some fruit in here of course
for some natural energy some apples some
pears the Bartlett pears of course if
you want to you know it's good for you
finally beyond that you know we're gonna
get more reasonable here so I got
pop-tarts again this is I never get
pop-tarts I haven't eaten pop-tarts in
years but I feel like that's something
that would be good to have for a live
stream got some cheese dip and I already
have the chips for this at home so
that's good
then finally later on we're probably
maybe gonna need some like end of the
stream extra energy so just got some
classic Red Bulls to top things off
alright guys I am not done with this but
I do need to finish off this video that
I'm making right now so although I still
haven't completed everything like I
still have a UPS there that I'm gonna at
least connect the main system up to to
make sure it's got battery backup and I
might get secondary monitors going for
some of these systems but here is a
quick rundown of how things are set up
not even used in the predator x34 I
wanted to stick with basic 1080 monitors
for the monitors that were gaming on so
I got one 1080 monitor here set up with
arctic panther I got one more 1080
monitor set up over here and that's
actually connected up to the entry level
thread river system right there so my
gaming station is gonna be right here
I'm just gonna be streaming out your
simple you know me in the corner with
whatever game I'm playing right there
I've got the Logitech c920 webcam set up
there to capture my face and then I'm
gonna be using just a standard headset
to listen as well as to talk out to the
people on my direct stream right here
I've also got a mic going on up above
actually these are the same mics that we
use for awesome hardware so one is over
here as well and those are both going
over to the sound board right there
that's connected up to the streaming
system the streaming system is going to
be streaming the the master stream of
both of us so the other thing to point
out is that this system actually has two
HDMI is going out one to the screen here
and the other one going over to the
capture system and they're just set to
clones so that screen is also available
to the capture system Cal system is set
up with the ripsaw right there
externally so it's just HDMI into that
and then over here to this and then he's
gonna have pretty much the same system
he's bringing another Logitech c920 I
actually have another Logitech c920 but
I might connect it to that system there
but then we have to figure out his audio
because I might actually pass his audio
through the soundboard but then the
final little workstation sort of is
gonna be right here with the stool of
stool
and here's where the control panel is so
I've just been using OBS to get set up
and I do have proper capturing going on
with the camera as well as the two
screens from the two computers the last
part of this that I didn't really show
is what this camera is right here and
that's actually a camera that I have set
up just kind of suspended up there in
the corner so it can peek down there and
look at me over there as well as Kyle
right over here and then I get sort of a
wide shot of both of us all so it'll be
nice to have this stream able to be
going the entire time so that if Kyle or
I need to cut off our streams for
whatever reason if we need to take a
break or something like that that'll
still be available guys that's good
about do it for this video if you'd like
to see a bit more technical breakdown if
I have everything set up here rather
than just sort of a quick hit of how its
configured for the live stream please
