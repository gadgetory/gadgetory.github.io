welcome to pauls hardware I have been
planning this video I say that with
absolute confidence for a very long time
over seven months now because I wanted
to give it a quick experiment to let you
guys know if you're looking for a
bargain on a computer
what parts can you get away with not
even having today we're gonna experiment
with not even using a freaking computer
case and again completely planned well
ahead and in advanced I have this system
right here
my htpc been asked about many times I've
been promising an update on it that's
what we're doing today I'm gonna show
you guys what your computer would look
like if you ran it without a case for
again about seven months time I'm gonna
show you guys how this is set up right
now as well just to kind of give a
once-over of my HTPC configuration and
we're gonna see what it'll take to
actually clean this off since it is now
spring time and springing well that was
also planned ahead this is a very well
planned video so guys clearly my htpc
livingroom area here is not in the best
shape I left things dusty because I
haven't dusted here and I wanted to
leave the computer dusty as well as
everything over here dusty as well now
this HTPC is set up for HTPC duties
which means that via the external HD
home run over here with the cable card
over the network it can access the three
TV tuners that are in there so it can
record I have several SSDs actually a
couple SSDs and a big mechanical hard
drive connected to that and it's been
perfectly functional but it's also been
pretty exposed over here in the corner
now my focus for today's video apart
from just getting this thing cleaned is
going to be the difference between
familis and fan enabled configurations
so we have of course the big old fanless
CPU cooler on the top here which I
initially showed you guys in my video
year when Rison launched I've also got a
GTX 1080 over here which using EVGA s
smart fan mode has been always spinning
the Left fan but pretty much never
spinning the right fan so I'll show you
a difference in dust buildup between a
fan that's been spinning all the time
versus not at all over the past seven to
eight months now I wish I could also say
that the power supply has been the same
power supply this whole time but it
hasn't actually this was swapped out
just about two weeks ago
no about three weeks ago so this hasn't
been running 24/7 although this is a
slightly older power supply that does
run the fan all the time so
because of that I've noticed it gets
super super caked with dust at least the
old EVGA unit that I had here was very
caked with dust so I will also be
swapping that power supply out for this
power supply today the inner max digi
fanless 550 watts to further remove fans
and also further remove potential dust
buildup from the system now apart from
the basic HTPC functions of recording TV
and also being able to play games I have
set up the controls for this to be
controlled by this i/o gear keyboard
I'll put links to this stuff in the
description if you guys want to check
them out
I also have a logitech harmony 700
remotes so we can have a single remote
for turning the TV on and everything and
I'll put links to that stuff in the
description if you guys want to check
them out now I also have been playing
games out here and for that I've got the
xbox360 controller and it's a pair up
with that we have the actual receiver
everything's very dusty back here and
then this is the actual receiver for the
Microsoft media remote so those are both
of my infrared s infrared and wireless
receivers four controllers and the cool
thing about like the Xbox 360 controller
you can do this with the Xbox one
controllers as well is this receiver
allows you to connect up to four of
these so if you want to play
multi-player games or something like
that you can beyond that we of course
have a lovely assortment of soy candles
and final fantasy guidebooks because we
play it through Final Fantasy 10 and now
my wife is playing Final Fantasy 7
because she's also further set up will
definitely be required over here though
these two bags contain all my HTC vive
components so for you know
playing VR stuff that's important and
then also the intent further down the
road I'm not going to be doing this
today but the intent of course is to
wall-mount this whole set up and to do
that I need to get rid of this whole
bookshelf so I'm probably not clear that
stuff out - that really has nothing to
do with whether or not you should have a
case for your computer but for anyone
who's considered role without a case
let's proceed and show you guys what you
might be in for so I've disconnected all
the cables and let's give a quick
assessment here of the htpc after about
seven months and three weeks of use
starting with the drives over here and
I'm not sure how well you can see the
dust on these things but you know it's
definitely there especially back here
you can see a lot drives aren't super
susceptible to dust I mean the main
connectors are going to be your SATA
connectors back here and those are
covered when they're plugged in so not a
huge deal there and also most drives
like this are actually sealed internally
this one's actually a helium-filled six
terabyte drive from HGST
so drives don't necessarily need a lot
of protection at least when it comes to
dust but you do want electro electro
static shock electrostatic discharge
protection if possible so that's the
main issue with keeping something like a
hard driver in SSD outside of the case
and as you could have seen back over
there where I had this all set up these
were literally just hanging off of the
back of a subwoofer by their connectors
pretty much which is more safe for SSDs
and spinning mechanical hard drives now
when it comes to our motherboard CPU
memory and graphics card we can see a
lot more dust buildup and part of this
of course it's just because these have
been sitting in a planar fashion just
horizontally so dust falling down can
just fall and collect wherever it needs
to collect now the thing I've actually
been most impressed with with this build
when it comes to dust buildup has been
the efficacy both
cooling and minimal dust buildup of our
no fan Sierra 95 see here which I first
showed you guys in my can rise and be
passively cooled video now just for the
fact that there's no active airflow
going over these for the most part means
that there's really not that much dust
buildup and in fact a quick dusting off
with a feather duster or a little soft
brush is probably all you're gonna need
maybe if you you little hairs picking up
here and there's all there's been now
contrast that with our graphics card
here and again the Left fan on this
graphics card has been pretty much
spinning 24/7 because this system is on
24/7 and the right fan has not because
EVGA is intelligence this is a for the
wind too icx version of the GT GT X 1080
which has intelligent thermal sensors
placed around the card and it will only
spend the fans that it determines needs
to spin up now I would like to go in
there and actually reduce the threshold
on this so that neither of these fans
spin for typical HTTP see duties there's
really no need for these fans to spin up
at all they should only be spinning up
while I'm playing games so maybe I'll go
in there mess with that once I get this
thing reconfigured moving over here to
the other side of the graphics card we
can see of course more more dusty build
up on our chip said fan cooler and
everything I'm gonna dust all the stuff
off in just a second and I'm not gonna
use an air duster for it I'm gonna use a
makeup brush and it's awesome rememory
here fortunately again not much active
airflow over these so we have a little
bit of dust going over here on the edges
but not too much beyond that now all the
plugs I want to point out on the board
the ones that have been plugged in
there's no way for any dust or anything
like that to get in them but something
that you might be concerned about again
especially if you're using a
configuration like I have where you have
no case no dust filters or anything like
that is dust that might get into unused
plugs Asus has actually come up with a
solution for this in the past like with
their tough series where they have
plastic pieces and stuff that you can
put inside unused plugs to keep dust
from collecting in there this hasn't
really been an issue for me in the past
even with used boards or boards that
have set out for a while but it is
something to reality check if you're
about to plug say a graphics card into a
PCI Express slot that hasn't been used
for a while just
you check that there's no dust bunnies
hanging out in there whatever and maybe
consider a can of compressed air or
otherwise to dust those out before you
go ahead and connect up your overpriced
graphics card to it and there's really
not a whole lot more to be seen visually
here just more dust buildup here and
there so I'm going to take this outside
so I don't redistribute the dust here in
my living room and we'll go ahead and
get this thing cleaned off so now that
we have relocated into the harsh late
March Sun of the outdoors we can get a
closer look at this and also look at
some of the closer to the PCB parts that
maybe weren't visible as I was showing
you guys everything inside I didn't want
to point out though down here where the
graphics card was by the way and the
graphics card is in the lower slot here
to provide clearance for the CR 95 see
there's tons and tons of dust buildup
right under here this is a very typical
place for dust to build up in a computer
build so this is a good reason why if
you're doing some spring cleaning if
you're disassembling a computer and
getting in there to clean it out
definitely consider pulling the graphics
card and getting underneath there
because getting that dust out of there
is a good idea also lots of dust buildup
around the actual CPU socket here as
well I am going to engage the duster
here this is just one of my wife's old
makeup brushes nice and soft and get to
Dustin
so at this point we have decided to move
back inside because it's very bright
outside there's wild animals and other
dangerous that we're not sure about I am
just finishing up some dusting of the
motherboard using these convenient
smaller brushes that my wife also said
hey you can use these because I don't
use them anymore if you don't have
makeup brushes I don't know what to tell
you
of course you can use compressed or
canned air as well to clean components
that's a good option though they are
disposable so that's the trade-off you
can use an air compressor as well just
be sure that you have the actual air
pressure turned down as low as it can go
on those because the air pressure can
sometimes blast surface mounting
components off of a PCB also as Jo just
pointed out air compressors can
sometimes get condensation built up in
them so they can sometimes output some
liquid as well and you definitely don't
want that going onto your motherboard
but this video is supposed to be more
about should you use a computer case and
less about the cleaning process so let's
get back to that and I've got a couple
more thoughts when it comes to the
prospect of using your computer out in
the open and this is probably a little
bit more unique to my situation here at
home but my living room here is adjacent
to our kitchen and in our kitchen for
one thing we don't have an overhead
range hood to suck up the stuff as we
are cooking our fry and stuff and we
like to fry food from time to time
lugia was a great example so I have
noticed on several of the metal parts of
this motherboard because from time to
time we get some oil particles in the
air they are attracted to stuff like
metal and they can leave stains on it
so again that's not a huge concern it's
more of an aesthetic thing but it is
something that you might get a little
bit more protection from if you had a
case particularly that case had an air
filter to filter out some of the stuff
in the air you also might have noticed
this large dog behind me and that's
definitely something to be concerned
about as well dogs may be slightly less
so but also small children and I would
be crazy if I had kids right now to
leave a computer sitting on top of a
subwoofer like I have done for the past
seven or eight months I've been lucky
enough that the dogs as large and
cumbersome as this one might be from
time to time he's a little clumsy from
time to time but he hasn't managed to
knock anything over but physical access
to the heart
where of course is something that's a
concern especially when you have a
graphics card that you're sitting in
they're hanging without anything really
holding it up all that being said though
what lessons can we learn from my video
here which I've clearly been planning
for a very long time the first is that
if you're building a traditional system
it's probably a good idea to go with a
case it's just gonna be easier to get
everything together and it's gonna be
easier to keep things clean and it's
gonna be easier to keep things protected
however what's my next steps since this
is my HTPC which I have promised as with
many many months ago then I would be
doing a follow up on and giving you guys
more feedback
well first I'm not gonna be putting this
in a case so I guess I've learned
nothing from today's video that was your
job not mine
but I am going to take this corner over
here which is currently full of old DVDs
and games and stuff like that I'm gonna
clear that out because that's part of
the initial process and I'm gonna get
the old piece of wood that I was
initially planning on mounting this all
up to get it over here in the corner and
that will get me primed I think for the
next step which I'll follow up on in
another video so I'm gonna leave you
guys with that in the meantime of course
if you enjoyed this video hit the thumbs
up button if you did and I'll put links
to the parts I'm using here as well as
some other relevant stuff down in the
video's description and of course
subscribe to my youtube channel if you
want to see more videos like this in the
future for now I'm getting back to work
we'll see you guys in the next one
so happy to say that the HTPC is back up
and running and thanks to all you guys
who stuck with me all the way through
here to the end I just wanted to give
you a quick final look the Digi
fameless' is installed fanless fanless I
saw the single fan on the graphics card
but don't worry about that later the
drives are hanging precariously off of
the edge of the subwoofer but this is
how it's going to be for the time being
and also just to get a better idea of
how it's gonna look I did bring the slab
of walnuts over to set it up against the
wall ideally I'm going to mount it you
know just a little bit higher and stain
it and sand it and all that stuff too
but for now guys that's all for this one
again thanks watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
