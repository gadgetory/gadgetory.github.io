going welcome to Paul's hardware I first
should apologize to you guys because I
haven't posted much in the past week or
two actually decided to take a little
bit of time off right after CES but I'm
refreshed and rejuvenated and I'm back
with an unboxing and first look this
brand new case from fractal design this
just arrived on Friday this is the
defined nano s mini ITX case comes in at
$65 in a non windowed version or $70 for
the windowed version I have here it's
going to be available in March and I'm
just going to take it out of the box
give it a first look and show you guys
some of the features so after removing
everything from the box you can see this
is a fractal defined series case so
you'll see a lot of these stuff that you
might have come to expect it looks very
much like a define R 5 redefine s this
is a define nano s so it's going more
for the define s sort of aesthetic as
far as support for water cooling also
having a big window not quite as much
drive support but again lots of water
clean support so looking at it next to
the define R 5 that the Arctic Panther
is in you can see it is definitely
smaller it's about 50% of the volume if
you're just considering volume although
it is still pretty substantially sized
for a mini ITX case this is definitely
not an ultra compact it still takes up a
good amount of space and it's definitely
still wider which actually like because
it allows for taller CPU coolers as well
as more air cooling support looking at
the the case itself and just to give you
guys here a quick 360 view of it you can
see again a lot of the same kind of
construction look aesthetic that you saw
from the define r5 the define s of
course you have this nice big plexi side
window here I've left the plastic on for
now so that as I main handling it I
reduce the possibility of causing any
scratches of that sort of thing there
front panel here is again made of
plastic but it's got a brushed aluminum
look which means it looks pretty cool it
also doesn't pick up fingerprints too
badly there is a blue LED that's right
here at the top front I do still wish
the fractal would switch that over to a
white LED the blue I don't think matches
with the black and white aesthetic of
the rest of the case but there you go
the front door here also doesn't swing
open so bear that in mind there's no
five and a quarter inch bays in here so
in order to get at the 280 millimeter
dust filter that's behind here you
actually remove this entire front panel
you do have support for air filters or
for dust filters so here the front you
can remove this entire filter that
covers the entire bottom of the case I
really like this feature on the definer
5 and the define s makes it super easy
to clean although apparently getting it
back in there is sometimes a challenge
here's a more straight down look at
that's a dust filter so again just pulls
out just like that
and here they've actually used part of
the the feet to hold that in which hey
it's kind of unique it's got that and a
couple of track pieces there to also
hold that on covers the entire bottom
which means you're going to get a dust
filter for your PSU intake as well as
anything else you might put up here at
the front let's actually flip this
around so you guys can see the top again
real quick well I'm looking at it so you
have a mod you vent panel as frackle
calls them right here so you can pop
that off if you want to add some exhaust
or some additional cooling at the top or
leave it on it'll block some noise and
keep dust from falling into the case
front panel IO right here USB 3.0 a
couple of those so you do lose the USB
2.0 that you get on the define r5 and
the define s power burn at the top again
with blue LED reset button mic and
headphone jacks as for actual dimensions
it is a wide case again although not
quite as wide as the define r5 so it is
203 millimeters wide it's one three
point three centimeters that means just
over eight inches whereas the define r5
is just over nine inches for height you
had about 13 and a half inches tall and
metrics that is three hundred and forty
four millimeters for thirty four point
four centimeters and then as far as
depth 412 made it millimeters or forty
one point two centimeters weighs four
point six kilograms and a twenty six
point eight liter case volume let's go
ahead and remove these side panels so we
can take a look at the inside they do
come with captive thumb screws so I
already went ahead and loosen those and
here's a look at one of the first
removable side panels again if you get
the non windowed version both of the
side panels are going to be just like
this it's got that sound dampening
material inside that we've all come to
know and love with the define s and the
different I've defined our five does a
great job and also happy to say well
this does have a little bit of flex you
can tell the fractals still using their
heavier gauge steel side panel material
for that so
makes it nice and sturdy let's remove
this side panel to again I have not
removed that plastic the covering on the
plastic plexi because I'm just paranoid
about scratching it I will give you guys
a shot of that
before the end of this video with
everything removed so you can get a look
at the entire thing speaking of there's
a look at the interior it does come of
course with some accessories which are
still wired up in here since this is
literally my first time opening up and
checking out this case here's a look at
the included accessories of course get
some zip ties this is a pretty common
these days fractal has individually
wrapped all of your screws so thanks
rectal for doing some sorting for us you
also get a nice little add-on here which
is a three pin fan splitter so a lot of
mini ATX motherboards don't have enough
fan headers on them since they're tiny
so this will allow you to at least if
you have a single fan header plug in
both of the included fans the 14
millimeter and 140 millimeter and 120
millimeter they also get these two metal
strips these are actually meant to mount
a pump or a reservoir to the vertical
area here in the case so those vertical
strips you can mount those metal pieces
to and mount yourself up a pump and
reservoir okay before I continue on here
let's just skip this thing strip down
the rest of the way so after moving that
Front's dust filter you simply grab
underneath here and as is typical with
lots of cases give it a Yank and it will
rather unceremoniously detach this front
panel piece front panel piece again is
made pretty much entirely plastic which
isn't a big deal it's pretty sturdy
plastic more sound dampening foam right
there up front so that's nice to have
and other than that it's pretty
straightforward your air is going to be
coming in via the sides here so that's
why the front is is actually pretty much
solid and then behind this you do have a
dust filter so nice that all of the
potential intakes on this case are
filtered apart from potentially the top
although that's usually an exhaust and
you'll probably now get a better look at
that included 140 millimeter fractal fan
so that is definitely nice to have it's
a dynamic GP 14 to be specific and then
at the back you've got a dynamic GP 1220
millimeter I've used these fans from
fractal they're there the more
bare-bones versions compared to the
venturi series that you can get
but they do a great job they stay very
quiet and they've got some unique
fractal design going on in there so two
of those included and then apart from
that you also have some pretty fancy
features that I have really seen here so
well I guess I've seen a little bit
first off down here at the bottom it was
just pre mounted to the case you have a
mount that can fit either a 3.5 inch
drive down there at the bottom or it's
actually got multiple mounting locations
for different types of pumps so D D D D
C or D five pumps a lot of the different
variations that are available from water
cooling manufacturers like ek and Swift
Tech and that kind of thing will drop
right in there and the manual has a full
list of compatibility it's also got this
week's continuing drive support you've
got a 2.5 inch mountain right here which
I've never seen
I don't maybe it's been done before but
I've never seen it two 2.5 inch drives
can mount straight onto this little guy
that pops off just like that although
you'll probably be using SSDs and then
it mounts over your cutout for the CPU
backplate so nice that you have that CPU
backplate cut out and you have the
option to mount drives there as well
via this removable thing which again
removes with a captured thumb screw so
that's pretty nice too you've also got
another 3.5 inch mount right here and
that pops off like so it's pretty much
only going to go in that single position
right up there at the top because that's
where the mount is for it but that gives
you support for up to like two 3.5 inch
drives into 2.5 inch drives which for a
mini ITX build is very nice you can also
get a better look at the vertical slats
right here for mounting your pump or
reservoir or pump / reservoir again
there's just a bunch of those so you can
position it wherever best suits your
needs depending on what your water
cooling setup looks like so all told a
pretty nice configuration for water
cooling here and then if you can see the
side panel right here that's off you can
get a better look at the space that you
have for cable management which is
pretty deep right here and then where
the motherboard area is it's a little
bit thinner but you still a little bit
of space and fractal hose puts a little
conduit again here with some velcro ties
already wrapped in for your front panel
connectors and that kind of thing and I
like these kind of caps captive velcro
straps of fractal has so you can tuck
away some extra cables back
here or there's lots of space over here
beneath where that's a hard drive would
potentially be also flipping around to
this side you will notice probably
you've got lots of nice grommets here
especially on this angle portion when
you're looking at radiator support for
this you can fit up 280 millimeter
radiator up at the front
that's pretty sizable and you can do up
to 240 at the top
although bear in mind that you don't
have quite as much vertical space at the
top so depending on what motherboard
you're using and depending on like your
vrm support or like how big the VRMs are
or the heatsink you might run into some
conflict there so I'm guessing that the
front position here is going to be more
popular popular for radiators although
you can't fit one they at the top just
bear in mind your Maya your mileage may
vary depending on what motherboard
you're using here's a module bent I just
popped it off the top again a little bit
more sound dampening material on there
and then as you can see on the top of
the case here which has become much
lighter since I've removed a lot of the
components the channels here for your
well your fans or whatever you might
want to mount up there they are slotted
so again you'd have a little bit of
wiggle room with where you might want to
position that but just bear in mind
although you can do larger fans so they
do have some slots here for perhaps
doing 140 millimeter fan or 140
millimeter radiator
they are only officially supporting 240
s so it is positioned further away from
the motherboard tray just a little bit
although again just bear in mind space
wise I'm sure as these become available
you'll have people saying this
motherboard worked this motherboard
didn't work my main concern is going to
be some of those motherboards from like
Asus that has the riser rounding out our
look at the internals of what you can
fit you'll notice there's two expansion
slots here for graphics cards fractal is
not recommending anything wider than a
two slot card
although lengthwise you do have plenty
of room up to 315 millimeters long which
means you could fit like a tower 90 to
95 X 2 in here if you're really
ambitious but that's plenty of room
lengthwise for graphics cards but as far
as the thickness again stick with two
slot cards at minimum or maximum and
then here for CPU cooler support if
you're going with an air cooler you have
up to 160 millimeters of clearance which
is going to fit a vast majority of these
taller CPU coolers on the market I
believe like a hybrid 212
was only 150 five millimeters tall so
plenty of air cooling options in there
as well if you're going that route you
also have support for up to a hundred
and sixty millimeter long power supplies
so more power supply lengths down there
at the bottom and also nice to see that
fractal has not skimp out on stuff like
providing a little bit of extra foam
protection here around the power supply
the exit area as well as little rubber
feet for the power supply to sit on also
I wanted to point out that all of the
cabling inside the case here is all
black so even your front panel HD audio
and front panel on-off connectors
there's a little bit of blue on the plug
for the USB 3.0 but when plugged in you
and see that but very nice the fractal
has also kept things very clean inside
so even your fan cables and everything
else is all blacked out no ketchup and
mustard to be seen so there you have it
guys a first look an unboxing of the
fractal define at Nano s new mini ITX
chassis with sort of an emphasis on
water cooling possibilities speaking of
articling possibilities I need a new
water cooling project for this year and
I'm strongly considering doing it in the
define now s so let me know in the
comments down below if you think I
should build in this case I'm probably
if I do do a build in it gonna do
something for my wife she's a fan of the
color orange based on these facts let me
know what you think I should do with
this case what type of build what
platform all that good stuff now in the
comments below also maybe hit the like
button if you enjoyed the video check
out my store for shirts like this one as
well as mugs and glasses and all that
good stuff thank you all so much for
watching as always and we'll see you
next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
