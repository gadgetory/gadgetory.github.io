out there who is watching this video
right now whether you watch them live
whether you watching in the future thank
you so much for joining us this evening
or whatever time of day it might be
where you are right now this is awesome
hardware it's a live show we talked
about technology computers video games
we stream every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware if you want to want to
watch the entire show warts and all the
beginning the middle part the end you
can watch on Twitch but you can also of
course watch on our YouTube channels
this is episode number 195 we've already
streamed the first half - Kyle's channel
bit wit it's linked in the description
if you did not watch it you should yeah
so much important things we're just
you'll have no idea what we're talking
about in this half of the show if you do
not first watch that half of the show
alternatively Winchell never mind any of
that just continue watching this half of
the show right - you can go either way
leave things to your discretion we do
drink an adult beverage on the show we
have a beer two or three we also
occasionally use adult language so
please keep an ear out for that and
don't watch if you if that easily
offends you but Cheers though and thank
you to all of you who are joining us
today we we love you and we love your
mothers we love you so much
what are we drinking right now Kyle I
bet they're okay I've already had some
arrogant bastard classic started off
with some Dale's Pale Ale today yeah
just to bring you up to speed a quick
plug for our stores if you would like to
help support us in our endeavors check
out my store
Paul's hardware net is where you go to
buy stuff from me I have mugs and pint
glasses and mouse pads and many of the
things have my logo on it and it's all
really good so feel free to buy it if
you buy from either of our stores my
store at Paul's Harbor net or Kyle's
store at big with tech
slash store we will shout out your name
in the after party which is coming in
just a few short minutes we'll say it in
a dirty way I mean if you wanted to be
sexual we can make it sexual yeah
no sexual is the default yeah you have
to request if you don't want faces
tasteful tasteful and sexual always so
there's Cal store bit with top tech
slash store thanks to all of you for
your support
now under the noon
I didn't today oh yeah I'm very prepared
what did you do for a second I thought I
hadn't open any of my stories but then I
realize no I did I did do that
you got this I'm super on top speaking
of on top of things we have a big
announcement for the beginning of the
show you it is still the beginning of my
half of the show cell processing who is
our regular moderator although he is
slowly slowly being replaced by crafty
hack yeah in sort of a hand that rocks
the cradle' sort of way that's kind of
the vibe I'm getting that that's not a
good a dramatic thing we'll leave that
for later so processing it is his
birthday today
yeah so he's got the day off he's not
moderating so go crazy in the comments
second any of the donations that we get
are gonna go to sell we're gonna give it
we're just gonna give sell the money
yep this is not planned ahead of time or
requested by cell we just know that he
is very consistent moderating our video
or our live streams we're very
appreciative of that we hope you guys
are too because honestly there's just a
ton of porn spam bots that go in there
and it's it's yeah makes things more
pleasant to not have that nonsense
mucking up the chat room so you we think
so we think crafty for his efforts as
well we saw real porn Kyle's wife
wifey sauce is also muttering chat and
we like her too okay that said let's
dive into some tech news yeah I do have
a few things to discuss today starting
with a bit of drama Oh
betwixt the number betwixt the tops to
GPU manufacturers in the land Nvidia and
AMD and video of course is
Vidia AMD of course has their Radeon
technologies group RTG that makes the
Radeon graphics cards and you know at
the beginning of this month's July what
was that second yeah Nvidia dropped the
Archie X 2060 super and our TX 2070
super and a lot of people who were like
hey hey Nvidia you must have been aware
that AMD is launching their their
much-anticipated Navi cards in five days
and NVIDIA of course very Khloe about
the subject they're never going to admit
to you specifically yeah we were trying
to rain on their parade but a lot of us
in the not fooling anyone a lot of us
are like you know this seems pretty
planned out to me yeah but in a retort
AMD came back it was like oh yeah Nvidia
yeah your launch with your super cards
and everything guess what you got played
just like that they made they made a
motion kind of like that was very very
insult abated anyway there were some
tweets about this that that kind of
bounced around right when the Navi cards
launched the fifty seven hundred and
fifty seven hundred XT but there was a
more specific interview in hot hardware
with AMD vice president and general
manager of the Radeon division Scott
herkiman seen here with being bald
no where's Scott yeah it's mostly bald
it's a good it's a great hairstyle it's
basically very similar my anyway there's
Scott Scott's worried we're good friends
with Scott yeah but basically he came
out and was like yeah this was all
planned you guys this was not some like
we did this and announced this and then
they announced this and did this and
then we responded with this this was us
leading them baiting them into doing
stuff twisting their thing that their
things grabbing and twisting it's been
balls to bed in their will to ours
cojones obstacles I'm paraphrasing of
course wiener but more specifically
Scottie
they're trying to think of different
names for balls and I just thought I had
a lot more than I actually did yeah you
know years and years of being in grade
school should have at this should have
prepared me more for this moment
and I feel disappointed lots of things
for penis balls coming up short with the
balls twins don't really get a lot of
love yeah Aries Nuggets Family Jewels
is helping you out right now chatez like
a cat is like a real life game sharp in
various balls like a real life game
bollocks I'm lucky I like bollocks the
meme sec that's the sack that's more
okay more current I feel like cherries
maybe your cherries and they always come
into hairs all right grapefruits
obviously we could spend a lot of time
on this straight balls around brief
aside here but the point being Scott
said we know that they Nvidia have
tremendous burden on their gross margins
because their die size is big oh that's
that's talkin talkin on the fact
that Nvidia is still rolling 14
nanometer process technology whereas
AMD's on 7 nanometre Nvidia is like you
call me fat no yeah I mean maybe I mean
it just takes them so long to lumber
around to get from place to place I
guess again paraphrasing more cushion
for the pushin but Scott Scott said
because there die size is big and so we
just game played suggested retail prices
he said they also wanted to log jam the
r-tx 2060 and 2070 which were struggling
with slow adoption we wanted to do a
double fake says Scott not only to block
their super strategy but also slow down
their 2060 and 2070 it's been so much
fun these last couple weeks just playing
that out it's just fun finally to win
which is a bold statement in and of
itself fun to win yeah
in this division is what I would say if
I was in Vidya have you tested your
cards against our 2080 ti recently sure
is what I would say if I was in Vidya
sure and then if I was AMD I'd be like
and how much are you charging for those
by the way
exactly we have what percent of the
market is actually buying great deals on
our navi cards right if there is
something to be gained from all this
because obviously we're just playing up
a bit of drama here and everything the
back-and-forth
I think it is very curious because I
know this does go on one company gets
wind of what the other company is
planning they have to try to plan some
sort of retaliation especially in a
situation with AMD and NVIDIA where
basically they're the two only players
in the game there's gonna be some
gamesmanship going on between them and I
would say whereas it is fun to finally
win from Scott I think that's reasonable
to say I think they did kind of come out
on top when it comes to the Harrison
between the 20 60 super 20 70 super and
the RX 5,700 and an XT yeah there
there's there's arguments you can make
for both cards that's kind of where we
want it we want there to be competition
yeah and for them to have reason to go
back and forth so that you have and then
then the people also have a choice you
can choose one or the other for whatever
reasons anyway point being competition
is good I'm glad this type of
back-and-forth is going on I'm curious
to see if it's going to continue I'm
curious to see if Intel's gonna jump
into games like this if Intel really is
going to come out with something
significant when it comes to the the
discrete GPU space which we're hoping
probably not even in the next year but
maybe by the time we get to like 2021
until we'll jump into the game too we
hope they've they've certainly got a lot
of people on their side working for them
when it comes to product developments so
yeah this this kind of angered me a
little bit it angers whole price drop
this last-minute price drop and this is
just strictly coming from me being a
reviewer I don't know if you felt any of
this but I thought it was kind of a dick
move for AMD dropped this last minute to
the reviewers because I know I was
talking to like some of our other
YouTube buddies
at least one or two of them had already
shot their whole natty video assuming
the prices that AMD initially listed the
mass and so they had to go in and like
redo their entire video basically our at
least redo a chunk of it which doesn't
sound like a whole lot but it is when
you have a lot of going on it's it
is a lot of work you got to shoot it and
then edit it and then re-upload it and
all that stuff and I just I just thought
if they had really if AMD had really
methodically planned this out why didn't
they give the reviewers a little bit
more of a heads up saying hey youtubers
press Ramirez writers authors don't hold
on don't put the pen to the paper just
yet because we got a surprise coming no
they just said go for it and
we'll we'll break your hearts later you
know it because they wanted they
wanted to stick it to Nvidia way more
than they cared about the reviewers
feelings or their time or their you know
their yeah basically their time
essentially their lives which I get and
I think also it it also boils down with
Madison which makes sense trust me and
I'm all for competition and I know
how good it feels to win when you're the
underdog for so long but at the same
time you got to have a little bit more
respect a little bit more courtesy a
little more consideration and but but at
the state I thought why why then what
why couldn't they have just given us a
long heads up you know what it is they
were afraid that some would would
leak it yeah wouldn't Elliot toys if
they had told all the words because they
would have had to tell all I mean if
someone would have leaked it and NVIDIA
would have had time to counter
counter-attack and it just it up
for everyone if you if you're privy to
any of the press events that go on when
it comes to the computer tech hardware
space especially when it comes to GPU
and CPU launches and everything like
there are leaks that happen constantly
like it's it's kind of frustrating
actually being a reviewer because you
know somebody is taking this information
that everyone is supposed to you know
keep private until an agreed upon date
and somebody is sharing that with
with a you know publication that's gonna
publish it because they don't because I
don't care because they know they're
gonna get hits on it or something like
that right so yeah it sucks that AMD was
unable to tell any of the reviewers hey
hold off on certain aspects of your
review because there might be more
information coming because they would
have known that that information would
then have immediately got out of course
and then that might have made nvidia if
they were making last-minute decisions
about how to price their products maybe
be like well hold on are they are they
trying to with us or something like
that
yeah so yeah I understand your
frustration there my personal like mo
for product launches is usually like if
there's say week-and-a-half let's say
the product launch is a week and a half
away and you get the product those first
three four or five days I very rarely
start attacking benchmarking and stuff
like that well things yeah there might
be a driver update or anything less
you're exactly very it's very very
common for there to be last-minute stuff
very close to the launch date that comes
out yeah and a lot of times reviewers
have to modify their reviews or
something like that and for written
media for people who are making who are
publishing articles easier you can go in
and just you know edit some time edit
that text and update it whatever yeah if
you're making video and you already shot
it and it's already edited and you have
to go and Reese crypts or rewrite out
some some points to write to change your
conclusions but on the same shirt that
you were wearing on the if you
want to go that far not doing this
simple boy so if you wanna make it
service and everything on a new buddy
and all that that's something too so
that's probably more of a nitch concern
in this specific area though yeah I'm
just I'm just like reinventing no one
honestly cares about anything I'm saying
except me I just I I have the mic so I'm
gonna use it but honestly
couldn't couldn't AMD my last bit of
stupid ranting couldn't AMD have just
said hey guys just hold off on your
reviews or writing or filming your
reviews until this date and not even
tell us why but just
give us the heads-up just just just
nudge nudge wink wink wait to shoot your
video til this day and then tell us the
information and I've been perfectly fine
with that totally fine because the
benchmarks are the benchmarks and still
possible running you know maybe you
don't see how that would we have some an
AMD context so you should tell them that
yeah
I'd say the flip side to that would be
they probably had no idea when Nvidia
was gonna launch their stuff
sure yeah Nvidia launched on the second
five days prior to the seventh ray out I
mean they still knew their own launch
date for their own products they could
have just made it you know said like
three days before launch day or
something I mean honestly we don't need
a ton of time to film and shoot and edit
script shootin edit a video if there's
not gonna be any changes involved and
again I'm not even complaining because
this affected me personally like I shot
my video and you know like I didn't have
to reshoot anything I was just upset
because of other people that do what we
do
got royally screwed over there were
people who were who were greatly
inconvenienced by that for sure
okay sorry for anything no worries
moving on this is the silicon lottery
page for matisse or the code name for
isin 3000 series
they now have listed their bins CPUs if
you're not familiar with silicon lottery
basically they get large batches of CPUs
they go and test them all and then they
sell them prebend which means that they
guarantee within a certain margin that
you will be able to buy a processor that
will overclocked to a certain amount
beyond the specs that the manufacturer
promises okay so this is interesting for
a few different reasons
what is that 3900 X clock up to you well
there you go give us the goods
interesting for a few different reasons
one is that silicon lottery does get
lots of CPUs and they test lots of CPUs
so you can sort of look look at this as
like a general idea of what sort of
overclocking performance you might
expect with a given CPU sure you can
look at the ones that they're offering
it can be like alright there's a
reasonable expectation that I'll be able
to get
at least to the frequencies as the
lowest bins CPUs that Silicon lottery
hats so for instance with the 3700 X
lowest Vinton one is 4.0 5 gigahertz and
I'm pretty sure this is across all
course yeah so you know that's a decent
decent overclock it is 300 bucks though
of course that's up from the 230 dollar
price at the typical 3700 X so they
there's that up to four point one
gigahertz is three twenty four point one
five gigahertz is 340 that is the
highest frequency that Silicon lottery
will sell you for a 3700 X it's
guaranteed four point one five gigahertz
so this to me was a good indication that
AMD is doing you know a reasonable
bidding process on their site because
they go through and bend chips and if
you're looking at the 3700 X and 3,800 X
they have the same number of cores and
they're basically there it's basically
the same configuration it's just a clock
speed difference between them right
Silicon lottery four point one five
gigahertz for the 3700 X whereas the
3800 X four point three gigahertz
gigahertz sorry I've had some beer and
I'm not enough seating as well as I
could feel do that too so that's an
extra you know 150 Hertz performance
boost sure and even these numbers are
gonna be somewhat conservative because
silicon lottery wants to be able to sell
a chip that they can guarantee will run
at a certain frequency right another
thing about these chips if you look at
each specific one they actually do list
the multiplier that's used the base
clock that was used and the peak or that
was used okay so another thing that you
can derive from looking at these is just
sort of a general idea of what vcore you
might need for a reasonable overclock
because again we're looking at a large
sample size that's a benefit that
Silicon Lottery has so that many CPUs
that they've tested so 1.26 2 is the V
Corps that they needed to use on 3700 X
to hit 4.1 5 gigahertz and whether
you're looking at that
as that's a V chord that I should aim
for in my personal overclock that's a
frequency that I should aim for in my
personal overclock I had the way I think
that information is useful to you guys
so hopefully that seems kind of crazy
that there's a $40 premium over what a
hundred megahertz difference yeah
no you're you're you're very right but
Silicon lottery also deals with the
people who are looking for the best
performing CPUs they want guarantee and
apparently people are willing to pay
some sort of premium for those because
as you can see this was listed either
earlier today or yesterday and most of
them are sold out already the only ones
that are still in saw in stock are the
3700 xbase baseline 4.0 5 gigahertz and
I'll be honest this one's probably not
that into that interesting because
people could probably just buy a 3700 X
and overclock it it probably at least
performed the same how does someone
justify how do they justify selling a
3900 X that clocks to 4.2 gigahertz per
up for 800 over $800 you don't need to
sell very many of them no I definitely
done too but I mean like PB o 2 already
does a really good job that's three
hundred and ten bucks like over the MSRP
like PB o 2 is a super aggressive like
they really cranked up the aggression
aggro on on their boosting algorithms
for this generation I feel like in my
testing when I was rendering in stuff or
send a bench and premiere it was
boosting up to 4.2 even sometimes a
little bit like 4.25 on at least like 3
or 4 cores at a time so I feel like how
much extra performance are you getting
for an additional four hundred and ten
dollars here I think that's also the
thing is people very frequently look for
that all core overclock whereas like you
said with pvp bo2 and and and XF are
right like these CPUs will often take a
couple cores up to very high frequencies
there's a bunch of people in chat saying
like they're hitting 4.2 or 4.3 or 4.3 3
or whatever pretty easily yeah
so you know what whole digital how much
extra how much extra advantage are you
going to get by that bit of extra
frequency or by running at that higher
frequency across all course yeah on the
3900 X yeah is 1.25 volts which isn't
that bad I mean that's relatively low
voltage okay yeah that's that's pretty
impressed so there you go I mean fire 42
I don't know $800 impressive but that's
pretty damn impressive the four point
one five gigahertz is one point three
seven volts four point one gigahertz do
they say how why there's an ample sized
volts
I do not know huh I do not know
interesting yes okay if you're looking
for the top bins for each CPU the 3900 X
four point two gigahertz 3800 X 4.3 year
gigahertz and again the 3700 X four
point one five gigahertz and this is
what to me is indicating that AMD is
doing some level of bidding which you
could look at both ways either that
means the 3700 X is a better deal
because you're getting the base level
chips or 3800 X might be worth your
investments because you're looking for a
higher overclock for people who are
looking for those higher frequencies yes
that might mean it might be worth it to
drop the money on the 3,800 X if you're
gonna have a pretty reasonable
expectation that you're gonna be able to
get a higher frequency yeah yes pretty
much all I had to say about that last
thing to point out man that 3950 x sell
them for zero dollars Dan what a deal
can we preorder is that a prime silicon
lottery can we can I I'll pre-order yeah
I'll happily pre-order install my
pre-order series eventually I'm sure
they will get those in stock and and
they'll do the same thing with those
okay couple more quick stories to go
over this one's some pretty good news
actually because we've Oh
heroes heroes are very happy here here I
bump the camera step bunkin the can
everything fine here here okay buddy
he's
he's a good'n that bad here I'll be
careful
he's the the AC adapter cable for that
he don't want him to lie down he's such
a good boy he's not hungry he already
had lunch good all right sorry
so we've talked a lot over the past year
to about RAM prices NAND prices which
affect the price of RAM for your system
affect the price of SSDs for storage
we've talked about the potential
actually somewhat recently for prices to
go up this article is refuting that
according to the market research and
advisory company Gartner they're
expecting a 42 percent price decline
this year specifically from memory this
is a new report about worldwide
semiconductor revenue projections for
2019 they're expecting revenue to
decline by nine point six percent for
the companies involved but that is due
to an underlying trend which is an
oversupply of DRAM which is going to
cause the pricing to decline over 42
percent in 2019 or forty two point one
percent according to their damn
expectations that's crazy
which is a pretty big drop-off that
would mean and I'm just I'm just doing
some math in my head but a lot like
ebooks like a 60 a 16 gig kit right now
you can get for like 90 to 100 bucks for
a reasonably fast kit yeah that'd bring
it down to like 60 bucks that's how I
I would I would love to see the sort of
the standard right now is a 2 by 8 gig
kit for like any given you know standard
gaming PC I'd love to see that standard
increased it's like a 2 by 16 gig kit
yeah or 4 4 by 8 gig kits to suddenly be
going for much less money or maybe even
faster speeds music it's just maybe 34
3600 faster speeds also being more
widely available would be nice rise in
3000 series
love's 3,600 speed 3733 I believe is the
like highest multiplier you can go to
before it starts going to a 1 to 2 ratio
for the infinity fabric clock speed yes
but a couple quotes from the article
semiconductor demand has weakened by the
uncertainty in the sino US trade
relations under trump we've we've done
various speculations as far as the the
tariffs and stuff like that and how
they're affecting certain things but I
guess overall weakening in demand might
be something about this percentage
decline yeah I don't know people stuff's
too expensive so people aren't spending
money III don't know anyway that's just
a quote from the article I'm not gonna
read into it too much leave that to your
discretion
recently Taiwanese SSD makers a data
face on as well as team group have been
mulling over a 10 to 15 percent hike and
SSD prices and we talked about this
actually I think a few weeks ago and
enforcing a limited supply policy but it
would seem like with this news they
would be unable to do that right the
senior principal research analyst at
Gartner said hi smartphone inventory and
sluggish solid-state array demand will
last for a few more quarters there also
some new fabs opening up in China so all
this should lead to hopefully reduction
and DRAM prices hopefully NAND affected
as well bringing down the price of RAM
as well as storage it's really good for
the overall price of PCs gives you much
more breathing room to work with when it
comes to investing in the parts that
have a more significant impact on your
overall computer's performance such as
CPU and graphics card so this makes me
happy
maybe this will coincide perfectly with
like Black Friday deals or holiday deals
now we didn't get just like
like a two terabyte and that would be
super badass and we've totally down for
that all right one last but weekend
weekend oh one last news story hear this
from the bbc.com
Elon Musk Oh mr. musk we haven't talked
about him and we haven't we haven't
burst up to I wants to hack your brain
Kyle oh no that sounds like he has
revealed brain hacking plans this is via
neural Inc I'm gonna hack the brains
company that Elon Musk's set up to
explore ways to connect the human brain
to a computer interface this company has
now applied to US regulators to start
trialing its device on humans that's
right now okay do you want to volunteer
hmm
volunteer to do the hacking interestedly
screw someone's brain ups and wife
volunteering for neural link like this I
like this image here that's like some
chips and there's a brain your brain on
drugs
anyway Elon Musk has said that the
system that neural link has been
developing has been tested on a monkey
it was able to control a computer with
its brain which is impressive neural
link said it wanted to focus on patients
with severe neurological conditions
which would give you the impression like
oh they're doing good work good work for
science and oh man mind control to take
over the world but it would also give me
the impression that they're trying to
say that when they're actually trying to
do other stuff because obviously mind
control brain control just I mean this
thing's a little there's a little part
of me that was like hold on what's not
maybe we're not written quite ready to
check in you know I'm not sure anyway
that said Elon Musk envisions a future
of superhuman cognition which sounds
great
neural Inc has developed a device that
consists of a tiny probe containing
containing more than 3000 electrodes
attached to flexible threads thinner
than a human hair which can then monitor
the activity of one thousand neurons
in your brain this would be able to
target very specific areas of the brain
which would make it surgically safer
that sounds good knurling however did
not explain how it translated brain
activity or how it was able to stimulate
brain cells but musk says the system
would ultimately allow for symbiosis
with artificial intelligence that's very
able to communicate with AI you'd have
AI and then you'd have you and then
there'd be this weird interfacing time
and then there would be like you plus AI
together and then you have this like
weird nagging thought in the back of
your head that says like this really
means there's this the AI destroy all
humans maybe I should do one or the
other but eventually the AI be like the
humans ignore those thoughts those are
just remnants of your old inefficient
human self you have now become one
within the iris and and also destroy all
humans and destroy humans obviously you
said to yourself
organically yeah add my input yes now if
you're hearing in any of this
information and it is concerning to you
in any way
fear not okay
because then because in the past Elon
Musk cuz it expressed a significant
skepticism when it comes to AI saying
stuff like well suggesting for example
the AI could destroy the human race
right yeah
and now he wants us to become part of it
yeah or become one with it yeah seems
like he's even in a benign AI scenario
we will be left behind says Elon Musk
with a high-bandwidth brain machine
interface we can go along for the ride
and effectively have the option of
merging with the AI so obviously in a
development that is not concerning at
all
Elon Musk firmly an AI skeptic has
decided no AI is not something to be
feared we should
whoa sorry about that super bizarre that
was an interesting issue that I am not
100% sure I have even solved yet it's
never happened here before no not
exactly the breakers trip times which is
just a simple reboot of everything but
this was just the streaming system and
the monitors connected to it which might
be plugged into the UPS so so either it
was either the UPS or we simply loose
loose plug this under here
I just got deciding to fail then done
that's kind of weird with that to
suddenly happen after so long anyway
apologies to all of you guys sorry about
that
we we lost the stream and we were around
for a decent minute time we're not back
the hell were we talking about
no we were finishing up the UM must
thing and we were just about to roll
into our last segment that's good good
cow yes all right
Elon Musk wants to hack your brain yeah
cuz we're we're talking about before and
in your computers yeah and also our
computers the painter is saying that the
power should go out it's at such a time
as we were discussing do you think think
about that
let's move out now our final segment ask
the audience where we ask you guys
questions and you provide answers since
we are somewhat delayed and we are
trying to get through things without too
much further delay we're gonna go
through this fairly quickly sure so
let's ask let's ask you guys all three
questions and then we'll go back and see
if answers so first question is about
the RT x winning a t super what do you
guys think of it now the reviews are out
okay are you impressed are you kind of
impressed are you not impressed are you
pissed off those are those are the
options yeah pretty straightforward yep
read read those and choose which one you
feel most strongly about
I guess I could also vote now it also
faces in Oh crafty hack is on top of
things think he's on very crafty crafty
smiling much obliged to you here whoa
that next question posted in YouTube
just in case sees not since we've given
you so much information about it
would you let Elan musk hack your brain
mmm
with his with his neural link company we
since we discussed that so recently and
since the discussion was not interrupted
at all we got through everything yep
we can now make a full assessment of
that would you should you let Elon Musk
AK your brain with his neural link
company final question to ask the
audience today who's going to LTX this
weekend out the ex you guys who's gone
we're we're going I don't know if any of
you guys are going maybe a few of you
are I'm not expecting a lot of you to
say yes I'm going but if you are Kyle
and I are both gonna be there so would
love to see you say hello don't be a
stranger
yeah just approached us and and say
excuse me sir I would like to give you
this hundred US dollars in cash
and then and that's all you should say
just give me the money in the leaf
that's all my child it's all I know come
say hello we would love to see you talk
to you say hello to know to know what
you know sign any autographs you want to
remind catch a mind-meld with you to
allow us to control your mind we'd love
to be the EITS listener alike yes
exactly
all right that's all it's all the
questions I have to ask the audience
okay I hope you guys have responded to
those questions
what's the crafty hack has just been
spamming spamming the out of those
links Thank You cry love it
love you ready so even even though we're
probably only gay I'm gonna get limited
results let's see what people thought of
the 20/80 super reviews okay I'll what
do you think I'm a man I mean it's as
bad as mevalonic going
yes I'm not angry but it's just math and
nothing really beyond that I'm gonna
take the positive option since you
already took Matt which is probably
gonna win which is that I wouldn't say
I'm impressed but I was considering
archaea considering an RT X 2018 on
super super version will be better
that's that was my impression like going
over the numbers and everything over and
over again was like I was like there's a
small number of people who were about to
buy a 2080 who were like oh I'll get
this and said this is it's the same
price and it's fast those people are
probably gonna buy an RT X 2017 super
potentially possible and then a smaller
fraction of those people I think the
biggest upshot and the biggest
recommendation from like from my testing
lease that I came up with us like it's
700 bucks
you can get the founders Edition for 700
bucks yeah that's a good card yeah
anything that seems like significantly
over that is like such a waste
yeah like 750 bucks for an after market
just get the founders Edition yeah that
was anybody's goal or plan all along
yeah undercut all of their board
partners II did a fantastic job of that
oh yeah so thank you all those
results I've been stalling for time but
Kyle obviously Wow 70% and even more
more angry more impressed more than
two-thirds and then basically their
blood their blood is boiling
Wow Jesus I didn't think you guys were
that vindictive but we have 79 84
percent of people right now who are very
not impressed or actual actually mad
about this only 16% of people are happy
3% er Ryan promised six people and and
as we know this whenever we do ask the
audience it is a very accurate
indication of the market at large you
know these are all it's gonna be this is
gonna be taken to be very accurate
numbers thank you for all for your
responses next up Elon Musk Accu Branca
you're here and of course obviously Elon
Musk can do no wrong he's our
generations Tony Stark and I would be
honored to let him hack my
brain Paul send me into Mars I don't
care do it Elon I'm Yours baby oh yeah
that's a reasonable response Kyle but
obviously you are not leveraging your
position well enough I going under
option two probably not but I could be
convinced because you know he's gonna
hack your brain one way or the other I
think that's what it comes down to it's
inevitable you're gonna want to get as
much as you can out of it if I can get a
little scratch station or sex a little
little maybe a little handy something
like that from Elon Musk or from someone
he would provide that's not specified
okay well what would you specify well
I'm married so handy I mean can't you
get that without striking a deal with
Elon Musk and letting him pack your
brain and it seems a little well
excessive I'm having a conflict here
between my natural like you know
dedication and loyalty meant to my wife
and everything like that so in a
theoretical sense yeah you know if I
could get some money or whatever
hypothetically okay and that's what I go
for all right if we're asking like me
right now in the flesh what would I do
you know I'm happily married right and
everything like that could not barter so
it needs to be some mind-blowing sex
with Elon Musk mm that's what I'm saying
yeah and I'm not interested in that
directly or whatever but if he wants
what hacked my brain I'm just saying
that's what the cost would be right I'm
confused
okay so you got a hack my hack my penis
if you want to hack my brain that's yeah
you know you sum things up so well let's
see the results here no no no say the
majority of our respondents I will never
submit to Elon no matter how many times
he tries to call him to get back
together yes he does hit me about 26%
saying probably not so we have a good
60% majority leaning towards the
negative here and obviously the correct
response was fools he has already hacked
all of our brains
damnit he's always one step ahead yeah
but I technically win because I had the
second-best option here a do it
and you lose so drink drink beer or
something I haven't okay who's going to
LTX this weekend final question for you
guys
Kyle and I obviously are both going so
we have no choice but to say I am going
I'll be there in spirit we have the
turnip option as honorary since it's LTX
yeah I feel like he doesn't bring out
turnip as much vote for trapped guys
that 47 votes for turnip 92 vote so I'll
be there in spirit
we do have six people who said they will
be there cool those six people better
come up and introduce yourselves and
introduce themselves to ourselves
awesome Hardware poll and I voted yes I
am and tell us you tell us that you
voted there aren't six people
who come up to us and say Amen I didn't
hear but you got damn pissed off yeah
and and those are the six people who
suffered through like the power outage
and the computer stopping this computer
that we're streaming on right now is
running on a completely different power
supply by the way in case I didn't
mention that
yeah we just said like that swap swap
that out neptr I don't think that's what
fixed it it is definitely not we could
just plug it into a different power
strip
well yeah but you know you gotta go with
what you think is the case gonna fix it
before you just try swapping two
different power plugs that's what I'm
trying to get said if I could if I just
take the system and plugged it into a
power strip or probably two just worked
but instead I swapped the power supply
to us
perhaps I should have tested the
low-hanging fruit first is what you're
saying that that's what any tech tuber
would have done though it's a very
conservative swapping the outlet they
would have built them right a completely
new different power supply completely
new computer from the ground up fresh
installed windows ok fixed it guys we're
gonna we're gonna end in my half of the
show right now because obviously we're
on borrowed time as it
we're gonna quick we're gonna do a
really quick after party so stick around
for that if you're watching on twitch
we're gonna like I said quick after
party because we were way later than we
were intended to be at this point
oh and our wives our our our so yeah
thank you so much for watching and
YouTube the thumbs up but if you enjoyed
it your everyday tech thank you for your
continued experts in making time steps
for us the investor fam you'll be pinned
if you do that again all right the best
thing guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
