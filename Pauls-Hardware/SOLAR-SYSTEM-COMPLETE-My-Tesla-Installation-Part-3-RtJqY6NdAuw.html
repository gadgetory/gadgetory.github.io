hello everyone and welcome back to my
backyard this is going to be my Tesla
installation part 3 which means the
solar is going in today if you haven't
watched part 1 or part 2 I'm going to
start off with a quick summary of what's
happened so far so this is my backyard
such as is not much to look at but the
improvements going on have been to my
home so part 1 was basically a main
panel upgrade where they told my old
main panel off and installed the new
main panel they also did sub panels and
some of this work at that time part 2
was supposed to be the installation of
the power wall as well as the solar but
when they started checking out my roof
they realized that the roof was a little
bit too old and too worn out for them to
comfortably install solar on top of now
since that's something that they would
typically catch in the pre inspection
process and let me know ahead of time
and not actually on the day of
installation Tesla said hey we're gonna
offer to replace your roof here and so
that's actually what happened over the
past couple weeks they didn't replace
the entire roof they agreed to do the
area that the solar was going to be
installed on top of but they sent a crew
out came and did that and they did a
really good job I did a little bit of a
time lapse of that unfortunately a day
one when they're actually tearing
everything up the time lapse stops
halfway through so unfortunately I can't
show everything here but on day two they
came back installed the rest of it
finished it off and look they even even
painted my little connector points for
the plumbing stuff up there they painted
it all so it would match and that pretty
so from what I'm told today should
actually be fairly simple all they
really have to do is put the brackets
and stuff on the roof put the solar
panels on top of that and then connect
it up to the inverter over there which
is already installed so fortunately most
of the work for today is already
completed so it should be a relatively
short day but I am going to document it
for you guys nonetheless in fact I
started the time-lapse pretty early
today so this is already up and running
in order to capture every moment or at
least every three seconds or so
oh look at this little one you're not
supposed to have your toys outside oh
and that's not allowed
she doesn't kick oh now you're gonna
poop meanwhile here is over here just
incredibly well bathed yes good boy hero
some thing I'm kind of hoping I can do
today is they left one of these DeWalt
cordless batteries for their dEWALT's
power tools here so hoping I can return
this cuz I don't have any of these tools
it looks like it's seen better days
though so maybe this one's dead but I'll
give it back to him nonetheless this is
from when the powerwall been in ohh so I
just wanted to return it
Tesla has arrived yay
solar panels getting stacked up they're
just gonna set a ladder up and taking
them straight over the top of the roof
these are the connectors they can be
chained together I'm guessing these are
directional do not disconnect under load
the model panel is getting installed if
SC 325 max power output is 325 watts and
I didn't confirm that's so if they're
under full direct sunlight and that's
like peak performance per panel I was
curious what's inside at work check like
this
look it's the inside of my inverter I'm
part of it this is where it takes the
sunlight makes it into go-juice and it
spits it out there and goes over did
that stuff sorry for the overly
technical explanation people were
laughing in the first video cuz I I was
calling this a solar system portables I
don't know solar system seems accurate
to me
people were like thinking that sounds
pretty grandiose all the milky way down
well there you have it guys as predicted
work went pretty quickly today only took
them a couple hours and the solar grid
is installed now if you're counting all
these there are 18 panels total 325
watts per panel means that's 5000 850
watts of total potential power that
these can generate that's a peak of
course so if it's overcast like it is
today I'll probably be seeing a little
bit less power generation than that's
but it should be more than adequate to
supply my home with the power it needs -
how are things I was kind of curious
about how these are actually mounted to
the roof and if there was any flashing
required or that kind of thing and they
actually have these these plastic pieces
that go so they they use a stud finder
to find where the actual beams are and
they mount directly to that there's a
large screw or bolts
it's pointing on the end so I believe
that means it's screw and that just
screws straight down through it and then
there is a channel on the side where
they can inject some goop the goop had a
special name but I forget what it's
called but the goop goes in there it
fills out the bottom forms a seal
between the roof and that plastic piece
and then the goop starts squirting out
the other side and that's how you know
that it's full and that they can move on
to the next one you also might notice
that my whirly birds are gone and this
is actually when they did the roofing
the whirlybirds are old technology and
they suck now but I've actually got a
vent that's along the entire top line of
the roof now so the air the warm air
that goes up there during the summer
when it's hot can just exit out there
and apparently it's a much much more
efficient way of doing that so that was
a nice upgrade that came along with the
roof and then kind of a nice finishing
touch for the solar panels themselves is
this kind of edging that they put along
with them just to make them look like
they're a little bit more flush with the
roof apparently they've been doing this
along the edges the bottom and maybe the
top edges for a while but they've
started adding them with some corner
pieces to the sides too this is actually
a newer thing that they've only been
doing for the past few months but even
though I signed up for this whole thing
last year they went ahead and included
that for no extra charge so I've
definitely been appreciative of Tesla's
efforts to make sure that I'm satisfied
with this experience and even stuff like
needing to do the roof or adding extra
things like that they've not been up
charging me or upselling me on even so
that's pretty cool I feel like I've
gotten some bonus stuff there without
actually having to pay for it I want to
point out that although all the hardware
is installed still not completely done
yet there's this conduit coming down
here for the inverter and they're
planning to do some better paint
matching with that I'm ok with this
paint matching that they did right here
but I guess they're gonna try to do it a
little bit more accurately before they
paint that conduit right now of course
the system is not on still need to
schedule inspection from the city and
with Southern California Edison and then
I can actually get PTO or permission to
operate and actually turn this whole
system on so you also might notice that
like for instance the stucco hasn't been
replaced here this is specifically
because the inspector actually still
needs to check this before they give the
okay and then that will be covered up
too so there's still a little bit of
stucco work to go on there and my intent
was to close this video off by answering
some of the questions that people have
left in the comments of the past two
installation videos but unfortunately I
can't get the Tesla app up and running
until I have the permission to operate
here so I feel like I should put that
off until the next video so guys if you
have any questions for me specifically
about this installation the power wall
the solar or anything please leave those
down in the comment section below and
I'll check those out and when I do the
flow of video on this which probably
isn't gonna be for about a month or so
and I'll give you a demo of the system
in use I'll talk about how it's actually
affecting my power bill and I'll talk a
little bit more specifically about how
it actually
works just so you guys know if my power
goes out if the grit goes out this will
still act as a battery backup for the
home that's actually something that it
wasn't a hundred percent sure about if
the grid goes down it will switch to the
battery and it can run off the battery
for a while also I can run my air
conditioner off of the solar so the
solar can power the AC during the day
when it's hot out and I need the AC and
the Suttons on the solar but the AC is
not connected to the power wall so if
the power is out I can't run off the
power wall or if it's at night I need to
run the AC off of the grid rather than
the power room but we typically don't
run the AC at night and I did come into
this experience knowing that that was
gonna be a thing and maybe if enough
people clicked my referral link down in
the video's description and get power
walls themselves I can get another power
wall because if I do five referrals I
can get the red power Walt it's signed
by Elon Musk this is purely an added
thing that I discovered after the fact
after I had paid for this whole system
and everything but guys if my videos
have helped you make this decision if
you're like yeah I like what I've seen
here and I'm down for the Tesla
experience and you sign up consider
using my referral link because I get a
four hundred dollar credit for solar
sign ups and five power wall sales and I
get the red one signed by Elon and that
would be kind of cool but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for this video so
definitely hit the thumbs up button if
you enjoyed it hit the subscribe button
too if you want to see my final
follow-up video where I talk about all
the other details and actually show you
this whole system in use once I get the
okay to turn it on from Southern
California Edison thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
