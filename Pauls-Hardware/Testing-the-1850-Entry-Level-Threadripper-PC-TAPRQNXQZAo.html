like me click the link in the
description for more excellent hey guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is my follow-up to my entry-level
thread Ripper build this system all put
together with current pricing costs
about one thousand eight hundred and
fifty dollars so I know that's expensive
for entry-level but we're talking about
thread Ripper here we're talking about a
high-end desktop computer and the CPU at
the heart of the system is the AMD
thread Ripper 1900 X which is an 8 core
16 thread processor and it is the
cheapest CPU that you can purchase to
get yourself into this platform and my
advice to people who are looking to
build something like this is consider
that CPU is an entry-level point and
then possibly upgrading to the 12 core
1920 X or the 16 core 1950 X and who
knows maybe AMD will release even higher
core count CPUs on this platform in the
future we're not really sure I know
nothing about that by the way I'm just
speculating but first off a quick
rundown of the parts that's installed
and then I'm going to go through the
setup process and we're gonna do some
testing on the system to give you guys a
better idea of the performance now first
off I have swapped two parts out of this
from the build that was published last
week and that's linked in the
description if you guys want to check it
out first thing is gonna be our graphics
card I originally installed an NVIDIA
founder's edition gtx 1070 TI and that
has been swapped for the zotac mini
version of the 1070 TI it's basically
the same design as their gtx 1070 mini
from ZOTAC a2 fan design and a fairly
short overall design the PCB is only
about 7 inches long and the entire card
is only about 8 and a half inches long
so that actually gives us a little bit
more breathing room towards the front of
the system where the CPU cooler is and I
swapped that out last night and actually
the zotac logo lights up in white which
max matches a little bit better with the
whites logo lighting up on our CPU
coolers CPU cooler is the inner max
liqui Macs
bread Ripper Edition the 240 millimeter
version of that's substantial 240
millimeter aloma aluminum all in one
liquid cooler in the Front's some very
nice clean-looking tubing on there as
well and that is already keeping the CPU
very cool although we're gonna test that
a little bit further in just a moment
here our motherboard is the asrock x3 99
Tai Chi which at 338 dollars is again
still entry-level when it comes to
thread Ripper the motherboards tend to
be fairly expensive although it is a
very very nice motherboard from the
testing I've done so far it's got all
the stuff you'd want it like a debug LED
surface mount and power and reset
buttons eight ddr4 dimm slots for lots
of memory and even a little bit of our
GB LED on there although it is subtle
it's just lighting up blue right now and
I haven't installed the software yet to
play with that the memory is a g.skill
kits and what I actually installed in
here and the build originally was a 32
gig kit this is actually back to a 16
gig kit g.skill 16 gigs 4x4 dr 4 it is
ddr4 3200 speed and actually that is one
of the things that i have not set up
I've set up most of the stuff on the
system yet but the memory is still at
2133 so I need to go and set that up
beyond that the rest of the hardware is
registering in the operating system so
of course we got our 2900 X here X 299
Taichi motherboard there is our memory
the graphics card showing up here as
well and if you're looking at the actual
speeds here for the 1070 TI they are
locked as far as the speeds from the
manufacturer you can overclock this if
you want to yourself I'm rerunning it at
the stock speeds today just to show you
guys what you get coming out of the box
with this but it's got a base clock of
1607 and a boost at 1683
we'll see how much higher it gets beyond
that for storage for keeping things
pretty simple from the echo again as an
entry level system my recommendation is
to find yourself a 250 gigabytes or
there abouts SSD for this particular
build I'm using a Kingston HyperX fury
SSD and that is going to get the job
done it's a SATA SSD and that gives us
tons more expandability options for both
adding drives as well as utilizing the
nvme and dot two slots that are
available on this motherboard since one
of the main reasons why you might
consider thread Ripper
is taking advantage of all those PCI
Express gen3 lanes against this is
entry-level we're not really doing that
I don't have a bunch of nvme drives that
are gonna be plugged in but
expandability future upgrade options are
all there of course it's a test today I
have also connected up an SSD just
externally so I can load games off of it
and that's just connected via USB 3.0
our power supply is a Corsair RM 850 I
if you look at the description and the
parts list for the system I've
recommended a 750 watt power supply this
is just one that I have and is
functional and able to be used and put
in the system because the system is
actually going to be a setup for a
charity auction giveaway the Cal and I
are going to be running towards the
beginning of December still more details
forthcoming on that but we've decided
we're probably gonna be doing the
everyone does a small donation amounts
and then we pick a winner from all the
people who have done donations so this
system could be yours in the future who
knows and finally of course the case the
fractal mesh if I see chosen not just
because it looks pretty sexy but also
because it's got a nice big tempered
glass side panel window so you can look
inside at your finished build and lots
of airflow since this is a system that
could potentially have lots of hardware
integrated into it on top of what's
already there and I have plenty of
airflow to keep things cool now speaking
of airflow that was actually one of the
first things that I needed to do with
this system well technically the first
thing was updating the BIOS I did that
when on the x3 ninety-ninth XG
motherboard first off because the BIOS
that shipped with was a very earlier
vision in fact the revision I had wasn't
even available for download on their
website but I've updated now to version
1.7 that is the version that has support
for nvme raid on this platform as well
which is a really nice other nice
feature of the thread Ripper platform
you can take multiple devices that are
nvme connected raid them up and even
make them bootable and haven't gotten
into testing that either yet hopefully I
will soon but the trade-off there is
that I have a really nice CPU cooler
here from inter max and that has already
been keeping the CPU temperature super
chilly and hardware info 64 you can see
the actual temperature and then you can
see the offset temperature as well so I
haven't run a load test on this but
we're going to do that in just a second
but we can already see we're idling down
in the 28 to 29 degrees Celsius range
and dishing alright I don't know if you
guys can tell but I've changed some
things here basically I was getting the
memory set up and I had everything
configured and all I had to do was go
into the UEFI and actually set the XMP
settings for my memory which I had
switched over to this Ripjaws 5 kit from
g.skill all the memory of using in the
testing today is from g.skill but not
all memory is made the same and since
risin likes faster memory I recommend
typically trying to hit that 29:33
memory divider if you can't get up to
3200 but that will get you better
performance single-threaded performance
better gaming performance out of Rison
processors both on the mainstream side
as well as talking about 300 per year so
when I discovered that this kit was
amongst the memory could sit ahead I was
excited because it's the speed is 3200
ddr4 3200 castle NC 16 pretty tight
timings not not the tightest but pretty
good however could just could not get it
to post at all trying to run it the XMP
settings 3200 a little quirk to the UEFI
here from asrock you actually have to go
in and tell it to use XMP settings and
then you can go and and change the
actual memory speed if you want it so I
tried the 3200 that's where I tried that
weird 3066 or whatever it is
tried 29:33 tribe loosening the timings
up nothing was working couldn't get it
to post so decided to switch over to
this kit try to Z kit also from g.skill
with the super-tight 3200 speed cast
latency 14 timings that the kid I have
in there right now is using this one
won't work either
there's quirks there's different types
of memory there's different types of
modules that they actually stick on the
memory there's dual rank and single rank
depending on whether you have a memory
in just one side a memory on both sides
all these things can affect
compatibility with Rison platform so all
this is to say I have been spoiled so
far because most of the memory I've
tried with Rison has been pretty
successful for me but if you run into
this issue the solution is going to be
the motherboards manufacturers website
go over to the support page for your
particular motherboard check the memory
qvl lists these are basically memory
kits that asrock has tested themselves
and verified to work
that's the faster speeds you'll see
single channel dual channel and quad
channel whether or not it's verified it
looks like they put different notes for
these and here you have a data of X your
Corsair crucial G skill so I for example
just did a quick search for the specific
memory kits that I attempted to use them
it's not on this list at all so and
that's probably an indication that it
hasn't been tested and probably wouldn't
expect it to work so anyway just double
check this list if you want to make sure
that the memory kit that you get works
with the motherboard and then the
configuration that you're using and
you'll have a much better time just
going in there and plucks it plugging in
X and P values and not having to go
through troubleshooting and everything
long story short I have now installed
the g.skill Triton C RGB kits that I
have used with lots of different writers
and tests and different thread Ripper
tests and I know it works and lo and
behold I installed it set the XMP 3200
cast latency 14 and it works
it needed a boot twice and out works um
so yeah but let's move on from there and
do some audio testing first off I did
notice that everything was pretty loud
when I first set this system up so I had
to go into the UEFI and go into the fan
test it's thin over the fan tuning
function and as rocky UEFI and that
allowed me to just default set all of
the fans connected to silent mode and
that has quieted things down greatly
although it does still of course ramped
up with a CPU temperature increases but
here's a quick sound test at idle
that's not the quietest but it's not too
bad at all now let's try a burn test I'm
going to run unit in heaven 4.0 as well
as the i-264 burn test at the same time
and let it run in about 15 minutes and
then let's see what it sounds like
so as you can probably tell from that
sound test the Mesha fee allows lots of
area to flow through it also lets out a
pretty decent amount of noise and of
course we're doing a full system burn
test right now and running in heaven 4.0
as well as the ida 60 for system
stability tests so this is about the max
that you could reasonably expect as far
as a load on the CPU and the GPU at the
exact same time all that said it's been
going for a little over 15 minutes now
and fortunately the cpu clock speeds
have been been pretty consistent we're
hitting at about 3.8 to 3.9 gigahertz
across all of the cores all eight of
them so that's pretty nice in fact I
feel like you couldn't do much better
manually overclocking this CPU compared
to what it is right now but of course
there're four CPUs do get binned dies
they get the best rise and dies that
goes into thread rivers so we should
expect pretty o'clock speeds and
performance from them now again that
offset is showing us the CPU temperature
of 94 degrees with a max of one oh one
point six but again that's 27 degrees
hotter than it actually is the actual
max temperature for the CPU was seventy
four point six during this test and
we're actually hitting more rounds the
high 60s is what it's actually settling
in at now I'd of 64 showing the
temperature slowly climbing and that is
again because we're using an all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler and the liquid will
slowly get warmer and warmer over time
it can take a half an hour to an hour to
actually hit the max temperature but
chances are we're not gonna get more
than a couple of degrees warmer than we
currently are right now and here we can
see that our ZOTAC 1070 TI mini doing a
fine job especially given that there's a
lot of heat going on in the system right
now from the CPU and the GPU at the same
time again I have not done any
overclocking of this card and it's
sitting about 1911 megahertz max
frequency although it's typically
sitting more at the 1825 to 1850
megahertz range right in there so not
bad at all considering that we have an
overclock that's running at the stock
frequencies and I would imagine you
could probably push this up another
hundred megahertz or so with a bit of
manual overclocking temperatures as well
are perfectly reasonable 75 degrees is
what it's sitting at right now it only
topped out at 76
so again for a smaller size card with a
smaller size cooler and two fans on
there I think this is actually a great
combination for this particular system
so next up let's do some actual testing
I've run a few CPU benchmarks and a few
gaming benchmarks just to give you guys
a better idea of how the system will
perform I just want to point out that I
have not tested the CPU at all ever
before and I've not tested this GPU the
1070 Ti at all ever before so I don't
have a whole lot of comparison numbers
because I don't think that would be fair
to do a direct comparison although I do
have some stuff for the CPU to show what
it's up against but let's start out with
cinnamon then we'll play a threaded test
here and what I would expect to see from
the eight core thread Ripper is
basically an 1800 X level performance
but a little bit faster because it is
gonna be running at a slightly higher
frequency mostly due to the fact that
it's better been chipped and xfr and my
experience with thread Ripper has led to
higher peak clock speed and in fact
running about 3.8 or 3.9 went under full
load across all the cores and it's
running at about four point one to four
point I think at four point one six six
was the max single core frequency that I
saw which is pretty nice and in fact
probably a faster single core speed than
you can achieve if you're doing an all
core overclock and trying to get to 4.0
or 4.1 which is doable but anyway I
didn't want I didn't want this to be
mainly about overclocking let's look at
the numbers Cinebench is up first of
course and I do have some comparison
numbers for this 17:43 was our
multi-threaded score that is just a
little bit just a little over 100 points
faster than there are seven 1800 X which
hit 1644 single-threaded performance hit
167 and here if you're looking at some
of the Intel comparisons of course they
do have better single core performance
however 167 is again a few points higher
than our 1800 X which scored 160 for CPU
mark our overall score was seventeen
thousand nine hundred and thirteen a
very respectable score and in fact
faster than most of the mainstream stuff
that I are pretty much all the
mainstream stuff I've tested which makes
sense fast in 1900 X and you really have
to go up to something like the 1950 X or
1920 AK X on the AMD side or something
like a 79
60 X or 79 80 X II on the Intel X into Z
estat form and/or get higher than that
single third performance stills holding
strong at just over two thousand two
thousand ninety six and that again just
edges out the eighteen hundred X's score
of two thousand eighty one next I threw
some blender render tests edit starting
with splash fishy cat remember these are
time and seconds so a lower score is
better here thirty two point nine
seconds was a score for the 1900 X and
again that's just a little bit faster
than the eighteen hundred X's of thirty
three point six seconds next to the BMW
twenty seven render takes a little bit
more time so two hundred and seventy
eight seconds was the score for our 1900
X Y again beating out the eighteen
hundred X and I won't point out here
also beating out the i7 eighty seven
hundred K next let's move into some
gaming tests starting off with 3d mark
firestrike ultra again not doing many
comparisons here but I want to focus on
the physics test on the CPU side twenty
thousand for forty nine was the nineteen
hundred X's score with a graphic score
of 47 ten and an overall score of 48 24
my comparison numbers here bear in mind
please we're using 1080 T is so the GPU
score is definitely not comparable but
the physics score may be is and at
twenty thousand it did beat out all of
these tests have run currently on the
mainstream platform whether you're
looking at Rison or intel's coffee
liqueur qibla key moving along to rise
of the Tomb Raider DirectX 12 test and
I'm doing the geothermal valley test
specifically for this one one hundred
and ten point two frames per second was
the average framerate at 1920 by 1080
with a minimum of seventy seven point
nine and moving out to 1440 we had an
average of seventy point one with a
minimum of fifty eight point one and our
final Test player unknowns battlegrounds
at 1920 by 1080 we had an average frame
rate of 81 fps zero point one percent
low was 46 fps and at 2560 by 1440
average frame rate was just over 60
that's good that's a good number to be
able to hit with d-10 70 TI
61 FPS on average and a 0.1% low of 40
point five so there you go guys some
tests on my entry-level thread Ripper
builds coming in at the low low price of
about one thousand eight hundred and
fifty dollars I'm pretty impressed with
the system overall although of course it
does come with a set of caveats like
most
due to some degree main issue for me at
least testing this was of course the
memory configuration getting fast memory
to run with a risin or threader per
processor is definitely the way to go
however it can be quirky and this was
probably my first experience
encountering some actual difficulties
getting some sticks of memory just to
plug in and play nice at the rated
speeds that the memory was set to so a
definites encouragement for me that you
guys to double check those memory qvl
lists make sure that whatever kit you've
gotten has been tested at the rated
speed or a dive into some of the more
advanced overclocking features there are
several videos on that I still
theoretically have one coming on that as
well because there are some extra things
that you can do with memory to try to
eke out a little bit more performance or
get it running at the proper speed for
my solution it's not a very practical
one for the actual intent of this build
because the kid I put in there cost
about twice as much if not more than
twice as much as most of the 16 gig 4x4
kits that you can buy that are even that
same rated speed but what I'm gonna do
is get a kit that I can swap into here
to go along with the giveaway that is
rated at at least three thousand if not
3,200 so you will if you happen to end
up with the system you'll be able to see
the same speeds that I did in my testing
today and for now you know we've got the
g.skill RGB stuff in there so you know
it's RGB I guess I couldn't escape RGB
for this build no matter how much I
tried other than that though the case of
course nice good airflow temperatures
were very reasonable throughout and I
like the combination of the higher flow
case as well as that enter max look max
Red River did a specific cooler
I thought the GPU did a great job as
well
very reasonable speeds very reasonable
temperatures very reasonable noise as
well I would say also generated from
that so if you guys are interested in
this build and maybe putting it together
for yourself a list of all the parts is
down in the description below so feel
free to check that out if you have any
feedback for me on my testing of this
system or the build in general of course
leave those comments in the comment
section as well I think he has so much
for watching this video I'll be back
with more very soon so don't forget to
subscribe to Paul's Hardware thanks for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
