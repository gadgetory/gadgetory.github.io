this is a live show Kalen I broadcast at
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time to a couple different
locations twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware as well as youtube.com slash
Paul's hardware in my case where we
streamed half of the show you're
watching the second half of episode 110
it's 110 - beat if you missed the first
half it's on Kyle's channel aka bit wit
and the link to that should be in this
video's description so check that out
thanks to all of you guys for watching
us live if you're watching us in the
future it's okay all of the stories and
everything that we're gonna discuss
today is linked down in this video's
description hopefully at some point some
some kind soul will also create
timestamps for us as well so yes direct
you guys it's the stuff you most want to
hear us discuss we've already been
streaming for an hour which means that
we've been drinking a few beers we might
use language of a body or distasteful
nature so bear that in mind the clothes
see like Howl's demonstrating right now
and as already mentioned we drink tea
brews right now we're enjoying some Cali
cream and vanilla cream ale from Mother
Earth Brewing Company just refilled
Cheers here's Brad cheers - Kyle cheers
to you guys thanks for being here Cheers
you're one of us now and we're going to
continue our discussion of the tech news
of the day just to just to bring
everything full circle we have also been
enjoying some dragons milk which was a
porter which is a little mouse I'm sorry
I missed out one fit a stout which is 11
percent alcohol by volume
I haven't feeling now and yeah that's a
heavy hitter it's a heavy hitter support
that goes all right a couple things if
you want to help support our channels
and the content that we're producing the
things that we do you can buy some stuff
on our stores Paul's Harbor dotnet is my
store and you can buy shirts mugs and
pint glasses they're all laid out right
they're all very high quality stuff I do
not sell you guys garbage it's good it's
good garbage they're good things they're
very positive reviews yeah so yeah buy
some of that it's a great way to help
support us in get yourself some nice
merchants at the same time bit wit dot
tech slash stores Cal Store as well I
feel like my store is way more sexist
than yours because I don't offer women's
t-shirts yeah Cal doesn't have women's
t-shirts I have a misogynist
misogynistic story he hates women if you
hate women - and my store it's just a
terrible terrible business model yeah
that's bad bad marketing badly anyway I
love women I'm married to one yeah I
know what I'm so glad I married a woman
and not a man well I had so much I love
what I mean yeah you know not that
that's a bad thing no it's not I'm just
saying for me like that's my personal
testament testimony like Mary I like
married woman she's cool she plays games
she makes me food I've never met a man
marry I marry a woman who loves video
games and if you love video games -
it'll be a wonderful bonding opportunity
for all of you
Confucius says I'll highly recommend
that myself
yeah all right we ended the first half
with tech news we're going to continue
it with more tech news so let's just
let's delve right into that the tech
news iasts news of this past tech news
was from PC world and their hands-on
with Andy's Radeon Vega frontier edition
in fact they were able to compare the
Radeon Vegas
tradition versus the nvidia titan XP in
a battle to the death I don't think
anyone actually died but the frontier
edition of some of course based on IMD's
new Vega core and Vega has been
anticipated highly looked at towards by
PC gamers for quite some time
this one the testing here has 16 gigs
have advanced hmm to memory it is it is
also the air-cooled version of the card
which has a 300 watt TDP the
liquid-cooled version of the card which
has also been teased but isn't available
yet is gonna have a 375 lot CDP so you
can assume that has even higher power
delivery requirements and that kind of
thing you might notice as as the pc
world's video is panning across here as
a GPU TAC area right here it's a series
of blue lights that light up to show you
how much load the graphics card is
actually under so that's interesting
that's kind of interesting
it has a light up our logo on the corner
lights up and yellow what do you think
it like the new color scheme like we've
gone like sort of blue and gold and blue
I mean honestly like really like
remember this is a workstation
workstation graphics card so for gaming
center it's not the gaming version of
the Vega yeah there's a pretty good
chance I'm not sure but there's a pretty
good chance that they might go with a
different color scheme or something some
different sort of design style for Vega
when it yeah the consumer like the red
and black is more like aggressive yeah
whatever reason it seems more sporty
more you know more like I don't know
just gamer centric and and the blue and
gold looks a bit more mature like
professional I guess I mean you could
say that you could also say it's UCLA
colors and they suck but hey let's move
on and bastard to talk about the
comparison that PC world was able to do
between the Vega frontier Edition and
the Titan XP which are next be right
there yeah oh well black just looks like
tekneqs that looks like a Titan X but
they can buried it actually in
benchmarks to attain XP
a close-up look at the GP tack by the
way they series of LEDs as well as a
couple eight pin PCI Express graphics
power connectors basically here's how it
all played out
because PC world was one of the only
publications that had anything about
Vega upon launch and the launch was
asked yesterday by the way people were
able to order it yesterday and it was
shipped out yesterday so presumable
presumably some people are receiving it
today and we might actually see full-on
fleshed out independent reviews of it
very soon but PC world was given sort of
a bit of early early access AMD brought
them in and they they introduced them to
a set up demo that AMD had put together
there were identical systems using Rison
7 1800 X CPUs 32 gigs of DDR for memory
running at 2400 speed SSDs and both
systems and 4k panels they had a
Founders edition Vega card in one system
and a Titan XP in the other system
basically the tests they ran were all
focused on enterprise workstation
applications so they weren't really
focused as much on gaming on gaming
which makes sense because that's what
this launch is all about is a
workstation card on a gaming card they
did a SolidWorks demo which had a model
of a card I'm sorry in a car they were
able to look at it in SolidWorks and
Gordon who wrote the article Gordon Mong
said it looked pretty smooth everything
worked pretty well they were then able
to export that card using AMD's Pro
render plug in to an Unreal Engine 4
simulation that they could view using
HTC vive which is kind of a cool demo to
be able to be a developer create a 3d
model export that into a game engine
which are becoming more popular for this
type of application as opposed to the
very expensive proprietary software's
that are designed by companies game
engines can do most of the same
functions that they can be adapted for
this type of work so yeah that's that's
pretty cool but the families
the big offenders position has really
meant Spears front frontier addition
sorry I keep mixing that up maybe if
they didn't make the date a name simply
an effing similar similar yeah it'd be
less confusing frontier addition vega
card is actually meant to compete with
andy Quadro cards whose aim DS l-- items
in the workstation space and also
represents andy kind of trying to get
back into this space since their fire
proline kind of died out with the last
generation of GPUs yeah yeah do you know
if it's gonna be dual eight pins from
both the air and and liquid-cooled it
seems like the article seemed to
indicate that there might be an
additional six pin for the liquid-cooled
well but it's not hundred percent sure
that was again that was basically even
seen in the images of the the
liquid-cooled one right there been a
couple that have gone around but I
haven't seen one as the the power
delivery and pricing I think was like
what like twelve hundred for the air
cooled like $600 that's actually been
changed originally was gonna be twelve
hundred for the air cooled now that's
been dropped to 999 Oh interesting US
dollars for the suggested retail price
air cooled the water cooled edition is
expected to be fifteen hundred dollars
but it's not going to launch until q3
okay so you gotta wait a bit for that
and again the TDP for the air-cooled
version is rendered watts the
water-cooled version is 375 watts this
waiting suit we can assume they've
cranked up the frequencies and the card
is outputting more heat but with the
liquid cooled version it's able to
control that and provide a current that
can work in a workstation environment a
workstation enterprise environment isn't
exactly the place that you would see
lots of liquid cooled graphics cards
going on because liquid cooling
introduces smart points of failure
potentially and it's not as reliable
long-term of a cooling solution as air
cooling
however AMD again is going after the
quadrille line of GPUs from AMD which
range from like two thousand or line of
GPUs and SEC module head of GPUs to
Nvidia thank you for being on top of
this and say I'm trying to pick up I'm
glad you're correct
because I don't like saying this but the
quadrille line of GPS from Nvidia which
can range from like two to six thousand
dollars yeah so a thousand and fifteen
hundred bucks seems slightly more
reasonable when you stack it up it's all
relative yes so in the demo that they
set up the frontier Edition versus the
tekneqs being side by side systems the
systems were identical they were using
rise in seven 1800 X CPUs 32 gigs of
memory and again SSDs and 4k panels the
frontier Edition outscored the Titan XP
by 28% in Katia and creo
50% in solidworks and 14% in max on
Cinebench so pretty decent leads all
around of course better in some areas
than in others
in gaming however they did say that they
took away the 4k monitors they replaced
them with 34 40 by 1440 21 by 9 monitors
and they tested three side-by-side
setups with doom with Vulcan pray with
DirectX 11 and Sniper Elite 4 using
DirectX 12 however based on how the
article is written I think all that was
was a side by side visual demo of saying
like look at both of these see if you
can tell the difference mm-hmm and
according to Gordon he said he really
couldn't tell the difference between the
two of them so that's you know a good
thing for the frontier Edition Vega
cards of course they're going up against
a Titan XP which is pretty expensive
it's 400 bucks and you can get a 1080 TI
which has comparable gaming performance
for around $650 but again they're sort
of riding the line between saying this
is a enterprise card this made for
workstation environments and you know
what can it do in a gaming environments
because the expectation of course is
that these same Vega GPUs will be put
into gaming grade cards made for
consumers that hopefully will be
available soon right although we still
don't know exactly when there's been a
lot of sort of early leaks with Vega
there but there have been some cards out
in the wild that have been tested
I've also been the Vega frontier edition
cards that have been tested in the wild
not necessarily as part of this demo
that have shown varying levels of
performance now Gordon who is personally
a reviewer who I trust and have been
reading his stuff for really really long
time he said that the drivers are still
being worked on for consumer Vega and he
still firmly believes that the the Vega
GPUs at least the Vega GPU in this
implementation the full-fat Vega with HP
m2 will be faster than a GTX 1080 and
probably closer to the performance of a
GTX 1080 is exciting which is good to
hear but yeah the cards started shipping
yesterday so again we should see actual
for reviews of them coming very soon
from people who actually ordered them
the distribution to the tech press was a
little weird this time around but again
it's an enterprise card so it's hard to
say AMD seems both to be being somewhat
careful with this launch but also I
think the emphasis on the performance in
the enterprise space I think is a little
bit more specific because they can
compare it to Quadra cards that cost a
lot more hopefully we'll see more
refinements when it comes to the the
drivers for these so that they will will
see more direct comparisons with Nvidia
cards I think soon Ryan Smith from an N
Tech said that he has said lots of
people asked him and they did not
receive a Vega frontier edition sample
and as far as they know no one was Andy
is very very much a Strickler stickler
about that sort of thing like if if they
know that you're a review site that sort
of caters to the gaming demographic they
won't actually provide you a review
sample of a workstation graphics card
even though it might be really good for
gaming because they don't want the
reviewers to deliver content about that
card in such a light that paints it as a
gaming GPU well I mean they take the
produ oh yeah knowing no one got a
sample of the produ Oh unless we're
strictly going to review it from a
workstation standpoint which everyone
wasn't we all wanted to see just how
amazing it would be for gaming which it
was good for gaming but that's not the
the message that AMD want to get out
with that particular model it's the same
thing here if you're unless you're
reviewing it strictly for workstation
stuff they don't want to hear what it
has to do with gaming you know so that's
kind of unfortunate but but I mean yeah
they it's up to them as far as how they
want to launch their product I suppose
these we gotta buy it ourselves there is
a there's a Radeon Pro website landing
page has a little bit more information
about the frontier Edition that's
available all the different names all
the donation money that we have received
today is going straight to a frontier
Edition Vega card if you click the Buy
Now oh my gosh $2,000 yeah a new egg
it's nine it's 2,000 bucks
Victor there were that made donation and
you can pre-order it that's weird it
says it's available today but then I'm
doing it says the release date is 629
which isn't for two more days I don't
know what's going on apparently some
places had it available for four
actually today yeah I just closed the
thing and I didn't mean to close it damn
it
it's okay
sorry one moment
that wasn't supposed to be there okay
we are still on the first story of the
first segment on your half by the 7:30
and it's it's okay we're gonna we're
gonna plow through this these just the
point mainly because you stole this from
me I certainly did not sir yes he did
nope so Kirk Tucker NC mining cards are
now a thing you totally stole this from
me I didn't even see this when I was I
know you should look a little bit more
closely Wow labeled labeled brick no I
didn't buy everything that I did was
first thing this morning and woman sorry
it's fine we'll talk about this after
the show take us outside all right
cryptocurrency mining is going pretty
crazy right now due to the price of
etherium as well as several other
cryptocurrencies that are resistant to
ASIC mining application-specific
integrated circuit which makes which is
which what is what killed consumer GPU
mining for the sums first stuff like
Bitcoin since etherium prices have gone
up and since GPUs from the consumer
space but the most effective way to mine
that they've been sold out everywhere
they sold that's the AMD cards several
weeks ago if not a month ago and the
Nvidia cards since they're becoming
slightly more viable to do this as well
have started following suit the
follow-up to this is the Asus and
Sapphire are now going to be releasing
Pascal and Polaris based cryptocurrency
mining carts Pascal being the nvidia
side players being the AMD side so here
are the cards and you might notice if
you compare one to the other a little
slim on GPU IO for example these are
basically cards that are made for
cryptocurrency so that made to be as
inexpensive as possible so they cut out
those pesky
that costs more money for the
manufacturer to integrate like video
outs for example so HDMI for example
every time you put it on a on a graphics
card you have to pay a little bit of
licensing fee to the HDMI consortium if
you don't put the HDMI ad on the card
will they need to have to pay that money
money save so there you go
hopefully the launch of these cards will
allow the market to balance out somewhat
since the GPUs and the gaming space have
been so expensive and so overly priced
we're really not sure how much of effect
of an effect they're gonna have we're
not sure how much availability there's
gonna be for these cryptocurrency
specific cards we're not sure if the
appetite for cryptocurrency mining is
gonna be so much that the cryptocurrency
miners just buy up all these cards and
then keep wanting more cards that give
me the case to but hopefully if things
go right I hope they get is not good for
crypto mining because because it's
already plagued with shitty HBM to
yields and like oh yeah and that one's
already been it's already been very
difficult to obtain yeah there so that
would just compound the issue and I feel
like they'd have a really sad launch
look like oh we've got like 200 units to
every big retailer globally and we
probably won't have anything after that
for the next six months or like I don't
know like HP m2 is already a hard topic
to get around because yields are so shit
right now and they have been and that on
top of crypto miners who are eating
cards up and trying to resell them or or
just reselling them for insane amounts
is
kind of concerning yeah it is
interesting to see the manufacturer
response to this current trend though
the Asus product pages for these four
examples specifically lists these as a
mining GPUs I mean that's just exactly
what they're made for they show stuff
like their hash rate performance and the
fact that they have increased power
delivery and some of them while cutting
certain stuff away to reduce costs
they've also improved stuff in certain
areas such improving such as improving
power delivery for more better lifespan
with sustained 24/7 operation as well as
the fans which are again made for 24/7
operation which previously apparently
maybe that wasn't as much of a concern
because if you're playing video games
try not playing 24 hours a day
true I mean maybe you are maybe you
heard more like that and then of course
our x4 70 and GTX 1060 variants of both
of those Sapphire has five different
mining Edition skews we've talked about
this a little bit more on Cal saps so
feel free to check that out if you want
to these cards feature limited
warranties so usually only about three
months to six months restricted display
outputs to reduce cost presumably of
course lower manufacturing lower
manufacturing costs to reduce the costs
out the door for cryptocurrency miners
whose main concern is recouping the cost
of the hardware they buy so that they
can start making pure profit as soon as
possible and more on whether or not
that's a good thing
later in the show ooh the mini super
nintendo class this is launching in
september it's gonna be 80 bucks this is
the follow up to the mini nintendo which
was so insanely popular Wow
sold that everywhere was available only
in a few locations and grossly
overpriced if you guys were interested
in this Super Nintendo version of that
this is coming soon 21 games are
included includes earthbound a super
mario world as well as an unreleased
star fox version which to me is one of
the more interesting things about this
now my previous argument
this sort of thing has been that well
emulators exist and presuming that you
have purchased all of these games
legitimately at some point and have the
cartridges it is legal for you to own
the roms and run these via emulators
there might be some legal gray area in
there but basically that's how it works
we're not drunk nope now if there's some
added value to this that you can't get
otherwise
such as an unreleased previously
unreleased game especially when it's
something like Star Fox the first game
that ever used polygons and 3d actually
actually legitimate 3d rendering on
Super Nintendo yeah yeah yeah starfox is
the first game that actually used
polygons so I was like the first game
was just wireframes so everything mm-hmm
you can navigate but it was actually 3d
rendering but yeah that makes it perhaps
slightly more interesting anyway though
the list of games here is contra Story 3
the alien wars Donkey Kong Country
earthbound Final Fantasy 3 f20 Kirby
starts kirby superstar Kirby's Dream
course Legend of Zelda a link to a pack
linked to the past which will probably
be very very popular
Mega Man 10 or Mega Man X Secret of Mana
starfox and starfox to Street Fighter 2
turbo hyper fighting super Castlevania 4
super cools and ghosts which is one of
my favourites to be honest Super Mario
Kart ok let's go everyone's favorite I'm
on Super Mario RPG legend of the seven
stars super mario world classic super
metroid super punch-out and Yoshi's
Island yes yeah so this was a little of
course feature an HDMI connection so you
can plug it into a 1080 or
high-definition television which is
difficult to do if you have a classic
console how many of these are they
actually going to produce no idea
probably probably not enough not to be
my guess not nearly enough yep
and one interesting note is that the
controller cables for these because it
does come with wired controllers that
are basically replicas as the original
controllers the games a Super Nintendo
have 5 foot long
Able's instead of the three-foot long
cables that came with the NES classes
TVs have gotten way bigger in the last
20 years making them slightly more
usable however there is an expectation
that there will be third-party options
of wireless controllers since it does
have USB ports that should be available
sometime after launch if you guys are at
all interested in this and you have no
idea about the clusterfuck that was the
NES classic the original one that one
was retailing for $50 MSRP they are now
selling on ebay I just looked it up for
around two hundred and thirty two two
hundred and forty dollars minimum so if
you are interested in the SNES version
make sure that you are there at at the
second when it goes on sale to actually
get one otherwise you're gonna be paying
a pretty penny from some shitty reseller
who bought like 50 of them or buy as
many as possible and make a promise and
yeah some one to me because I'd like one
there you go but yeah incredibly high
demand there's one going for 600 one
going for 600 and NES classic it's
modded and it includes some other shit
you know need but that's that's pretty
crazy
yeah but hella deals did you say what
the price point was alone eighty bucks
I'm sorry eighty bucks
$79.99 so they've smarten up a little
bit they're like oh we can sell this
video they increase the price a little
bit and it will be available on
September 20 Nate yes alright continuing
on with tech news say Soph Sandra is a
benchmarking utility sigh soft Sandra
and it has no relation a centralized
database where you when you run the
benchmarks your benchmark will be
uploaded to unless you change different
settings and someone with an Intel copy
like six core processor Rance I saw
Sandra and didn't tell it to not upload
the information to the database and so
it was uploaded to the database and now
we know some information about the copy
link CPU there
testing resuming of course this isn't
all some elaborate fake this is still a
14 nanometer processor this will be the
follow-up to the current CPUs on the
mainland line so the main stream line
goes up to Kiwi Lake right now with two
7600 K in 7700 K the ID listed on this
actual test is genuine Intel CPU zero
zero zero zero which means it's an
engineering sample it has a three point
one gigahertz base clock at four point
two gigahertz boosts clock 256 kilobytes
or kilobits I'm sorry of l2 cache per
core and a total of twelve megabytes of
l3 cache that's two Meg's per core so
these are likely the same these are
these that's basically the same cache
configuration that cabling CPUs have as
far as the amount of cache per core you
just up that for a six core CPU and
that's what you get sure this would be a
highly refined 40 nanometer node based
CPUs like what's to us 40 nanometer plus
plus 40 nanometer resolution was what
has well did and then Kaiba Lake did I'm
sorry with skylight did and now kb lake
and now company the coffee lake so three
different variants all on the same node
the die size would be 149 square
millimeters and interesting note from
the article is that quad core parts
won't necessarily be cut down or
variants of that six core silicon with
disabled scores but wouldn't actually be
a separate 726 millimeter die so they're
they're actually manufacturing both of
these separately with different wafers
the Geekbench scores that's actually the
follow-up to this SAS off sandra
actually leaked earlier on June 22nd
today on the 27th we have Geekbench
scores kind of in the same no same vein
I should say
Geekbench scores uploaded in the same
basic way
the score was 4619 for the single core
score and
twenty thousand eight hundred and twenty
eight for the multi-core score that
would actually be pretty comparable with
AMD's risin five sixteen hundred x six
core cpu which is a 6-quart twelve third
processor which would theoretically be
about the same as far as core count and
thread counts to this coffee like cpu
but we should point out the 1600 x score
would be at 3.6 gigahertz which is the
baseline for that base clock
whereas this Intel CPU that was being
tested had a base clock of 3.2 gigahertz
and we of course don't know what the
entire lineup will have this might be a
lower end CPU with lower frequency there
might be a higher frequency base clock
cocktailing CPU that might be able to
outperform rise in at a higher frequency
are you sure 3.6 gigahertz isn't the
boost clock for the 1600 x that's a base
clock there when they're testing all
these across all cores and when all
fours are under your under load it's
just gonna run it's a base clock
frequency job typically the turbo
frequencies from risin and intel or only
when it's running on like one or two
cores unless you overclock it till it's
around all cores at that higher
frequency if you're wondering what's
next after coffee lake it would be
cannon lake which is ten nanometer and
will finally be a an actual refinement
and a shrinking of the manufacturing
process okay BB 110 yeah 10 from 14 to
10 is where they're going next
alright next up is hot let me hardware
where we're gonna talk about some
hardware news some stuff either out now
or coming out very soon basically is
what we're going into right now so on
the m4 side if you guys are into Rison
there's only been one Rison and four
mini ITX boards so far but it is being
joined the one I'm talking about is the
Battlestar one that kayla has already
reviewed on his channel and also done a
video with they're done a build with
gigabyte is now coming into the mix with
their mini ITX
ji-ae be 350 and Gaming Wi-Fi rise and
motherboard a bit of a typo here the
headline thankfully a headline come on
rezian okay um here's a board itself you
can kind of get a quick look at the
layout here here's a bigger bigger image
of it right there
it's got overclocking support of course
since it's got the be 350 chipset the be
350 chipset it makes a bit more sense
than the X 370 chipset with Rison in
Mini ITX because it's a reduction of PCI
Express Lanes that you have available
and since you've only got a mini ITX
board form factor then you don't need
all those PCI Express Lanes cool it
includes Wi-Fi support with an 802 911
AC Wi-Fi card you can see the Wi-Fi
connectors one thing the bio star GTN
does not have yes is Wi-Fi I feel like
everything else they're good about that
board for the price point excepted than
that way your motherboard sucks this
one's way better no it's got four it's
got a six phase vrm design so again can
support overclocking and who knows if
it's gonna be better or worse than
overclocking on of course full sized ATX
motherboard but it's also got 4 SATA 6
game it per second connections where
those for those oh those are up at the
top it's interesting right here along
the top edge next to the 24 pin
connector
yeah and it's got a single single 32
gigabit per second m2 slot which is on
the rear which we don't have an image of
that trust me it's back there for USB
3.0 ports on the rear i/o alongside a
couple USB 3.1 ports as well as HDMI and
DisplayPort outs on the back which means
that this would be compatible
theoretically with upcoming aim for ap
use so the rise in three line which we
don't know too much about yet but should
have graphics integrated as well so cool
glad it's it's got that available this
is this a bow starboard have video outs
I believe this yeah
okay it does seen that on quite a few
rising boards so it's not necessarily
something that
is rare but yeah but would be interested
in that because for APU builds I'm sure
that would be a thing especially for ITX
like this an APU build with the GPU
integrated could allow that expansion
slot to be available for like a caption
capture card or a TV tuner or something
like that so true
lots of you might have as much
flexibility as possible yeah
cool so I do believe I do believe
gigabyte is sending me one of those
boards so I'll do a build with it or
something like that I'll be checking it
out though beautiful all right next up
also from gigabytes we talked last week
about epic and here's an epic mother I
think 7000 series again a little bit
more on that was discussed last week if
you guys want to check it out but here's
an actual gigabyte server workstation
motherboard this is the mz3 one - AR 0 +
single socketed look at that yes so this
is a single socket motherboard epic
processors will be compatible with dual
socket motherboards as well look at them
dim slabs this one has
well first off @z ATX so it's fairly
large it measures 305 by 330 millimetres
16 ddr4 dimm slots look at that 8 per
side that supports up to 8 channel
memory architecture our DIMM modules are
supported for up to 32 gigs per module
and lrdimm or NV NV DIMM modules up to
64 gigs are supported it's also got two
sfp+ 10 Gigabit LAN ports on the i/o
back here I think that's the these are
the two of them right there you could
have up to a thousand and twenty four
gigs of ram if you had 64 gig modules
yes sixteen 64 gig modules yeah and it
supports up to two to the platform
supports up to two terabytes of RAM but
I believe that's with a two socket
configuration hmm so that's that's
pretty insane it's got a Broadcom BCM
fifty seven eight 10s shift for the 10
Gigabit LAN ports here at the back
that's also got a little heatsink on it
as far as I can tell for slim
sass ports 416 SATA 6 gigabits per
second board I am not positive if those
are breakouts like does that mean 6 like
does that mean each of those slim SAS
ports can break out to 16 SATA ports
would that be would that be 64 SATA can
a SATA devices you get I've connected I
I'm not sure I'm not positive about that
but it's also got an ultra-fast MDOT to
drive on there it's that slots right
down here towards the bottom PCIe gen3
by 4 interface for that and up to 4 PCIe
gen3 by 16 slots over here for the i/o
or for the PCI Express expansion and 3
PCIe gen3 by 8 slots the shorter ones
are the ones that are gonna have all the
pin outs on them now potential you might
have dependent depending on the length
of your GPUs might have some conflicts
with the memory here I was gonna say
bear that in mind but in a workstation
environment you're typically not as
quite as concerned put the massive like
triple slot fan cooler GPUs that he
would expect in a gaming environment so
yeah probably less of a concern also
seems like those lower slots wouldn't
have conflicts so true there it is
beautiful
epic board 3 epic content cool to go
over that hey Intel just today launched
or at least an embargo lifted for an
intel SSD the 5 4 or 5 s series the
model the minaton to reviewers and this
review from pc perspective is by alan
melvin tonneau was the 512 gig
now the interesting thing about this SSD
its it's a SATA SSD so this is not an
nvme am that - you know fastest is the
fastest SSDs available right now it is
still SATA as far as the interface goes
however it uses a new type of NAND flash
memory specifically 64 layer TLC NAND
so triple level cell and they're
stacking the nand on top of each other
more and more the specs are listed right
here as
capacities minimum Maximus sorry the dog
break it for a second your wife is home
it's got a five-year warranty to
remediate terabytes rid that total sorry
oh it's among the fastest SSDs oh wait I
want to I want to at least show the
second page here from Alan's dog emojis
in chat rollin
thanks for the dog emojis in chat emojis
that's great my wife is home so
everything's okay yeah Alan said
basically that these are among the
fastest SSDs that he is tested
especially at least when it comes to
SATA and if you look at the actual
breakdown of it when you take it apart
here just hacked something out there
it's it's a very very small PCB and that
is because again 64 layer TLC meant
means you have an insane amount of NAND
density so you don't need a full sized
PCB with a bunch of different name chips
on it you can come you can get it all
set up with just a couple of them stack
only in fact four flash packages each on
these each containing for 256 gigabytes
or 32 gigabytes dies of 64 layers three
demons it's got a silicon motion
22:59 controller in there and the 512
gig is 180 bucks that's pretty good
which isn't the most inexpensive SSD out
there for found 512 and it's on the
cheap bag given the inflated prices of
nand right now since the prices have
been going up right down it's definitely
not bad at all especially considering
that it is according to Alan among the
fastest is SATA SSDs he's tested you
know beats a samsung 850 Evo Wow even
competes with some nvme drives in
certain areas and Ellen has a new series
of tests he's doing on storage drives
and I've barely been able to get into it
which is why I'm not going into more
detail but feel free to check the
article if you want more information
Alan does really really
good storage tests on SSDs and lots of
other stuff - nice
alright Biostar has a new TB 250 BTC pro
motherboard we talked a little bit about
Bitcoin mining well I guess I should say
cryptocurrency mining on Kyle's half of
the show bio start is catering to that
audience with this specific motherboard
it's a b250 motherboard which means that
supports currents skylake and kb lake
processors which means you can slot in a
very inexpensive Celeron or Pentium
processor which seems to be the go-to
for Bitcoin miners because the concern
is not really with the CPU performance
this concern is with the GPU performance
and how many GPUs you can connect up to
a single board so look at the
configuration of the PCIe on this you
basically have a single by 16 slot and
then you have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11
little by 1 slots that you could some
rides or some Ram cables right you know
factors - actually these little adapters
that they have here with what looks like
USB keys these look like I don't know
these might even be DisplayPort cables
I'm not positive but they're just wired
up for PCIe lanes and you can use those
as risers to plug in your actual cards
with adapters that I would assume come
with the board but yeah usually most
motherboards miners can only place about
6 GPUs on the motherboard this one
allows you to connect up to 12 without
short-circuiting due to a specific
design that they have made for this
motherboard that only works for 4
cryptocurrency mining it was apparently
completely useless than any other
configuration yeah pretty much almost
useless outside of mining but there it
is
for anyone who's
looking for a crazy over-the-top board
and especially if you weren't very
enthusiastic about this
Bhaskar has also been doing some designs
for am for crypto mining these actually
can only support I believe six or seven
GPUs but these make a lot less sense
because if you're investing in
Rison like the cheapest rise in five
CPUs 160 hundred and seventy bucks
mm-hmm and that seems like sub 100 with
Intel yeah yeah so it makes a lot less
sense and also these aren't outfitted
with the crazy amounts of PCIe slots so
some Bitcoin miners are probably gonna
go for those first options first yeah I
would imagine cool but speaking of
Bitcoin mining Kyle let's uh yes let's
let's have a debate here let's let's
hash things out yeah let's go in to
swordfight all right let's do it
sorry buds next we're burning through my
half of the show my happy show is so
much more efficient than your half of
the show is because it's less
interesting you're right it's wait let's
talk about so cryptocurrency aliens is
it a good or bad thing that's the
question we're gonna ask her and we're
asking right now so all right so let's
let's just let's just show people this
is Chow poll we'll share this with you
guys in chat cryptocurrency is is
currently right now causing crazy crazy
overpriced graphics Kurtz yeah and I
need to paste in the right thing crazy
overpriced graphics cards which means
that if you want to buy a graphics card
and build a gaming computer right now
you're gonna pay a lot more money than
you would have otherwise unless you're
spending six hundred bucks or more those
really high-end GPUs haven't been
inflate haven't inflated too much so far
you're gonna pay 150 percent 200% of em
our MSRP and this is because mining or
using the GPU horsepower to completes
calculations that allow you to gain more
cryptocurrency you can put simply has
become more popular the the crypto
currencies such as aetherium that are
currently popular are very resistant to
mining with Asics or
application-specific integrated circuits
which are the extremely power efficient
little chips that came out after Bitcoin
became really popular for Bitcoin mining
and basically made it so that mining
what GPUs became a thing of the past
because why would you buy them with a
GPU which is inefficient
when you have these a six a six you
combine with now we have new
cryptocurrencies
you can't mind them with a six you can
buy them with GPUs in some situations
depending on your situation with getting
electricity you can buy a graphics card
mine with it for two or three weeks pay
off the price of the graphics card and
then just be making pure profit up to
that point but there's a blowback to
this it's made it much more challenging
to build a gaming computer because all
the reasonably priced gaming GPUs are no
longer reasonably priced you can also
just sort of view the current
cryptocurrency market right now this is
from a coin market capcom and you can
see Bitcoin right now sitting at a price
of about two thousand five hundred
dollars and aetherium right behind it at
least when it comes to market cap and
you can see this is the total value of
all of the bitcoins that's out there
right now it's about 41 billion dollars
for Bitcoin that's about twenty five
billion dollars for aetherium the price
per aetherium coin I don't know each
individual unit of the etherium is
called acquaint or not but it's about
two hundred seventy eight dollars and
that's actually a bit down yeah it
peaked it I believe close to 400 bucks
so the market camp is what
it's how much money is floating around
right now yeah so as as all the etherium
miners continued to mine a theory am
they make more aetherium and based on
the current price of aetherium that adds
more to the market cap right
you can sort these by price for examples
like if you have the most expensive
cryptocurrency you want Project X
apparently which is 350,000 but 23 today
you spit out in 97 or you can go for 23
skidoo
about 30,000 per I don't know how to
mind this I don't know how to mine any
of these anyway point being what's the
upshot to this is this a good thing is
it a good thing is it a bad thing Joey
you go first or you want to go first uh
why don't you go first okay I'm gonna
say cryptocurrency mining is a good
thing on gaming GPUs regardless of the
GPUs because we've already got crypto
mining specific cards on their way so
eventually that whole issue will be
hopefully taken care of where you won't
see as much of a shortage with the
gaming centric GPUs but I think overall
cryptocurrency mining is a good thing
for just society and and for our
community as a whole I feel like all of
a sudden we have this like incredible
groundbreaking way to make money and it
perfectly caters to the average tech
nerd it's like you have to build a PC
you have to buy a bunch of graphics
cards and set it up it's a very much a
DIY project and it really puts us in the
most advantageous position because we're
already sort of surrounded and we
already have a passion for this type of
technology so it's like there's a great
way a new found way to make money and we
already kind of know that gist of how to
do it like versus like the average like
any of our parents who might be all of a
sudden like watching you know a big
spread on the news about it and like
want to get into it like they have a lot
a lot further to learn a lot further to
go than we do because we're I feel like
we're already a story about the
forefront of where that technology
starts and then additionally it's
it's also a positive thing I think
overall in the grand scheme of things is
because it's also going to sort of
excite people about technology and
building pcs and maybe someone who never
would have imagined building a PC in the
first place now all of a sudden is
putting together a rig for the first
time because they're trying to mine some
Bitcoin or whatever the hell it is so I
feel like it's it's it's sort of a
gateway type of application that opens
up the doors to a lot of new users and
eventually will just kind of strengthen
the whole PC master-race or whatever the
hell you want to call it our community
of enthusiasts and it could it could it
could definitely be it'd be a nice boost
for for our our little gang here you
know I think it's cool I think it's cool
I gotta go for option two it's a bad
thing you're wrong first off it's not
opening the door to new PC users because
anyone who wants to get in on this is
looking at prices that are ridiculously
inflated and make no sense for anyone
who wants to dive into it right now if
you didn't get in on this current
Bitcoin mining crazy early and happened
to pick up your GPUs at a point when the
prices weren't ridiculously overinflated
then you're in a really difficult
position also point out that all right I
want to hate on Bitcoin miners I'm sure
there's a lot of you guys out there but
if you're not Bitcoin mining with
renewable energy I think that's kind of
a crappy thing that's part of the reason
I'm not Bitcoin mining we're in Southern
California I already used too much
energy as it is I have tons and tons of
graphics cards that I could plug in and
start mining but the amount of money I
would make from the from the coin mining
whether it's a theorem or otherwise
would be offset by the amount of money I
would have to pay for the electricity
and we're not in a renewable and
electricity situation here in Southern
California if you're somewhere when you
where you have support from hydro power
or wind power or solar power then then
you know more power to you ha ha go for
it and and keep doing your thing however
I would also point out just
one of the fundamental issues with
Bitcoin mining and-and-and coin mining
in general is that I don't want to dive
too much into economics but the only
reason any of this crap has any value is
because people agree upon it it's a mean
it's a made-up thing and it's only
because enough people have gotten around
and said yes I think that has value that
it has any value really there's no
functional value to it as well at all
it's not backed up by something like
precious metals or something that's
actually a exhaustible fresh limited
resource which in the past is what has
attributed value to things like you know
stuff that scarce like gold or that kind
of thing so the fact that it is
basically built up upon a cloud of hopes
and dreams of people who think that
these things should have money these
should be worth worth money makes me
think you know it I don't trust it and
you shouldn't die think okay there we go
let's just give all of our money away
since it is you know just a social
construct yeah I'm gonna just dump my
money dump my entire wallet tons I would
get more into that I was gonna dive into
like Wall Street and stuff like that but
I don't wanna go that far okay results
it's a bad thing
I win I win Kyle it's about you
yeah that's almost half almost half of
our audience thinks it's a bad thing
because probably more of our audience is
into gaming gaming computers than they
are actually do - you're takin em yeah
18% of people 65 votes that are saying
it's good and then just above that 20%
we're still pissed off so dogecoin never
took up let's do it
dogecoin here right now actually it's
nine no losers top ten list
Doge my goodness there it is dogecoin
dogecoin is currently worth point zero
zero two five three eight dials per coin
although look it's pretty fast with
everything just in the past couple
months
like the etherium boo
has caused like all of the
cryptocurrency to go to some extent to
some extent still not quite anything
near its peak of point zero zero 186 so
really low US dollars / dogecoin we all
look back fondly on those times okay
there it is yay okay never forget so
that is pretty much all of my prepared
stuff for today oh no wait is it yeah it
is yeah that was certified okay so we
have a few donations and some QA to go
over so starting with des Jones yeah
five dollars fun news guys talked to
EVGA rep a few days ago and it seems
there they will be releasing a gtx 980ti
hydro copper no ETA but at least it was
confirmed I believe them I'm sure that
would be a really nice card hydro copper
means it's gonna have more we're copy
any couple teases of that one yeah but
yeah it's exciting I hope it's using the
same PCB and power delivery design that
the kingpin of the King Fitness that'd
be nice
yeah that's hopefully that's what that
may be either polar I will get one and
we'll do a review on it Scott's dick
Dilbeck six dollars and sixty eight
cents hearing super metal makes it worth
it is it just me or is 50% of the time
one of your hands are on each other's
thighs I can my hands are usually you're
right you're right so I can't see what's
going on that's true me I mean so you
can see something if mine is on Paul's
leg but that's not my hands moving on
thanks for your donations and drew
suppler dollars Paul what would be a
good name for a black and white PC with
mostly white and white LED fans was
thinking winter is coming
something Game of Thrones related how
about snow blind
snow blind I like that that's a that's a
book
it's Noland that's a good book at least
audiobook I listened to it was my way I
like it good smooth end for the 10000
saying I love your show and videos not
very practical to watch live in UK
though I would imagine wanted to ask a
question last week but fell asleep
that's our bad if we are not
entertaining enough to keep conscious
questions following the next message
beautiful thank you very much Steve
check let's jump to that ok best bang
for the buck vibe rig for daily vr
gaming not only to gaming only and to
have good experience I 5 or I 7 or rice
and any benefit to having anything
better than a 1070 not considering the
insane prices at the moment right now at
1070 is probably your best bang for the
buck again not considering the insane
prices at the moment it's probably else
of what you're gonna have a better
option of finding at a reasonable price
you if not that then good for 1080 and
as for risin I you can get by with an
i-5 for sure but if you have the option
I would go for an i7 yeah I'm sorry
Rising Sun rising yeah as far as the
Intel CPUs when it comes to price to
performance I lean towards Verizon you
might get you might get a couple ticks
faster game performance with the Intel
the more cores in the future yeah and
that seems to where it's going so there
you go miss gutted Panda for the fight
buck so you skip detector sorry tech
cursor for the $10 donation thinking you
both for that amazing birthday shout-out
so there's our cut Paul question time my
PC will only post with ramen
single-channel advice does z170a our
motherboard 16 gigs read and za RGB kids
with an i7 6700k
it could be that you have a bunk or a
bad dim slot ya could try that I would
say take one channel or take one dim and
place it in every single slot and boot
it every time and make sure that it can
boot and successfully use it for a few
hours maybe a day in each slot and see
if there's any inconsistency from one to
the other
that could narrow down a potential issue
with one of the DIMM slots that has been
known to happen you can also try
rotating the memory that you're using
itself to see if one of your sticks
might be bad mm-hmm and if you have an
AC sport which looks like z170a are I
don't know but they have mem okay to
someone in check so just using them okay
oh yeah a good memory diagnostic tool
that also helps to sneeze I did that one
misguided panda for $5.00
hey guys wanted to upgrade my rig from
an i5 4460 MSI z77 to Verizon 7 which x3
70 motherboard would you recommend the
Asus prime or the msi sli plus I like AC
sports it was I'm a little biased
because that was my first ever
motherboard was an Asus P 67 in next
yeah I'd say with Rison especially right
now Asus seems to have been the most on
top of it as far as updates at least
when it comes to like the crosshair 6
that they were working on so that's
probably where I would lean as well
yep actually I'm wrong I had pieces of
it I meant z68 z68 chipset for uh yeah
what the fuck is that
Sandy Bridge Sandy Bridge any bridge
fall yeah yeah I realize case you said
very stable of course NB 67 $15 high
pile pile and call Falco I love the show
and was curious are you going to
twitchcon this year if so will there be
another fan meetup like last year I am
on the fence again we not know yet not
sure but if we do well we tweeted it'll
probably have a family that yep yeah
Louis headed an event $10 I'm falling
asleep
take my monies before I inevitably pass
out we gladly will Thank You Louis
adults sleep well dalton pro cots $5
what are the main benefits of crossfire
sli do you think it'll be feasible to
pair new crossfire sli mining specific
GPU with a normal version that's really
hard to say I would I would guess I'm
probably not oh yeah because if you're
looking at like a cut done 10 or 60 or
cut
well not as 10 60 because you can't
hassle I those but cut down our x58 year
for 572 pair that with one of the
current 5 70 years of five babies like
maybe it's I'm sure it's possible if
they're based on the same GPU but I
wouldn't be surprised if it was locked
out somehow um but we're not gonna be
able to say that for sure until those
mining GPUs are actually out and people
try it if it was gonna happen I would
say it's gonna happen on AMD side Nvidia
is much much more known for restricting
the capabilities of what you can SLI if
the GPUs aren't exactly the same exact
GPU and the same exact amount of memory
and everything yep yep dimension
Chowdhury Chowdhury with four hundreds I
believe that is rupees rupees and a pawn
Cal sir hope you guys still remember me
from last awesome Hardware yes with you
we can forget your name the benjin
Chowdhury dimension thank you so much
for emailing us helped me a lot building
my own PC you love from a 15 year old
fan from India right back to you
awesome imagine tech man thank you so
much you got the beat and yeah you're
awesome
my knees are the five bucks I'm
interested in building a mini or micro
ATX build what are your thoughts on the
Corsair air 240 case - for I have an air
540 and I love it the air 240 is a
pretty solid option it has a ton of air
flow it's pretty spacious for a mini ITX
chassis which means it's also not the
most portable but if you're not looking
for like actually like taking it from A
to B and there's not much travel
involved then it's a really solid solid
chassis air 240 yeah honestly is it
pretty is a pretty solid chassis it's
honestly just a smaller version of the
air 540 okay I haven't built in it
personally so I'll go with Kyle's locale
says it's it's it's got some decent air
flow and stuff but yeah it's really
affordable now it is to the Attic pass
five dollars you guys are awesome
thinking for everything you do meeting
you last Saturday remember the guy with
the loud gtx 1070 yeah was a total blast
hey Yannick yeah it was good
man I hope I hope the the course air air
air 120 fans that you won were helpful
with your with your choose airflow yep
I know you're trying to make your your
gtx 1070 bit quieter it was a gigabyte
megabyte ones and it was being loud and
yep yeah so hopefully you can fix that
and it works out for you it was great to
meet you there yep next time ciao Viva
Chavez $10 a beer for both of y'all you
guys were in Fremont recently he didn't
tell me I'm in the same San Jose I'm
sorry I got a but y'all a real beer I
tweeted about it that the day before was
ie to the day morning of it was kind of
a last minute we're gonna organize thing
but it was really cool to go there and
be there and we'll try to give you guys
a little bit more heads up next time we
do something like that absolutely even
five Great British camps thanks for the
answer and no you guys are not boring
last week fell asleep approximately 10
minutes before the show started
oh okay then yep that's good yep
we don't have a Priya pre-show so okay
mate penny five bucks do you each of you
have a nine-to-five job or are you
full-time reviewers slash tech gods love
your channel we are full-time reviewers
both gets used to work 9:00 to 5:00
doing YouTube videos for newegg.com and
then when you both branched out on our
own so we're fortunate to be able to do
YouTube full-time it's pretty awesome
job and we couldn't do it without the
support of all you guys out there for
watching us so thank you for helping us
live in the jury thank you all next
we've got a gun gun 45 $5.00 boom free
money also remember the Sandy the Sandy
of bridges but we remember never forget
never forget the Sandy at bridges thank
you very much about gun plus I remember
the p67 say to issue Robeck
a bomb $25 thank you very much a bomb so
wait a few year to upgrade my computer
origin chrono 6700 K 32 gigs of RAM GTX
1080 founders position okay is there a
great ultra wide IPS juicing panel you
suggest to get at the moment or one
coming out soon gaming movies use thanks
fellas
a bomb unfortunately if you
the ultra-wide 3440 by 1440 g-sync
displays their all over $1000 Asus Acer
does BenQ have one yeah no at least nice
Huson acer have them yeah me they're all
just they're all just really expensive
well under your finger do you wanna you
got to spend that much money right now I
know and it kind of sucks yeah I don't
know you know but it's really cool when
when you do have it yeah yeah I mean
it'll be it'll be a monitor that's good
for like the next seven years yeah it'll
be good but yeah I Shawn for the 2000
rupees best CPU for 4k productivity PC
mmm I'd say rise in these seven
seventeen hundred right now is if you
only bang for your buck yeah because
