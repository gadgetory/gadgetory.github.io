Paul's Hardware today's video is an
unboxing that's kind of what my life is
now like Fox's show up usually they're
from AMD I take him out of the box I
show you guys before I begin I want to
start off by dedicating this video to
Steve from gamers Nexus Steve he's kind
of like one of those characters who's
just a little bit on the I'm a grumpy
side sometimes you know he's like he's
like Scrooge in A Christmas Story or
something like that but Steve hates
unboxings he thinks they're awful and
they're useless I thought that if you
guys maybe reached out to Steve you
could share maybe this unboxing with him
and perhaps bring some love and joy for
unboxings back into his heart that he
can just stay focused on actually doing
useful stuff with the things he unboxers
but them all right you guys probably
already know it's in these it's probably
in the cytolysis form AMD this is
probably gonna be Vega spoiler alert but
I got two boxes I'm going to start off
with the bigger one here because this
one showed up first and if you can't
tell I already kind of opened it but
I've kind of put it back together so you
guys can have the unboxing experience
too AMD has Vega on the horizon it's
supposed to be launching very soon and
here in the box inside the box is a box
inside a box doesn't look like as much
hell's going on in that outer box I did
remember my spider coat today I was able
to find it thankfully so let's dive
right into this one see he put some type
as I reveal write it right from the
get-go Radeon rx Vega this feels it
feels very plush I feel like AMD has
been doing a lot more work or they've
been putting a lot more work into there
like engineering samples and the stuff
they study that's reviews that's always
inside later though here's the box now
this box according to what AMD has told
us is not the box that you're going to
get if you buy Vega at retail this is a
special design box that suggested for
reviewers but you will be able to get at
least the card that's inside here on the
top though we got the rx Vega logo bring
gaming to life system requirements are
on this side it does say a minimum 750
watt system power supply with two eight
playing graphics connectors this is a by
16
lot eight gigs of the HBM to memory in
there 16 gigs of system memory
recommended Linux Windows 7 or Windows
10 and you do want a 64-bit operating
system do people still even use non
64-bit operating systems and not sure
that guys like this rubberized texture
kind of going across the entire top of
this thing it does have a Vega logo
there on one side actually on both sides
and then the Radeon Vega logo 3d @rx
Vega which is right there on the top as
well so this kind of opens up like this
with a flat in the front and over the
top and then off the sides as well it's
hard to say which way is up too though
the whole thing just kind of opens up
and lays flat I guess on the desk kinda
like that so let's start off with this
guy right in the middle this is our Vega
Radeon Vega cube which doesn't look like
the reactive one like the one that Linus
got this is more of just an actual
acrylic cube with the Vega logo
suspended in the middle
I can't I'm curious if this if you could
set this on top of something and have
light kind of go up through it or
something like that but it is pretty
cool looking and it well at the very
least look very nice next to my life
thread Ripper acrylic panel thing so
that's coming soon I don't think there's
anything else tucked away under this
panel right here or behind this panel
this is all foam we do have a little
booklet right over here that says Radeon
rx Vega bring gaming to life and a
little flip book action here until now
game developers have been shackled by
hardware limitations unable to witness
the full extent of their imaginations
very Marchetti vague is disruptive and
there's pictures and look they have a
picture of the unboxing experience that
I just did I guess in case I miss
anything
stuff about drivers and system
requirements
Sansa's look at that like a hand of
somebody apparently there's a there's a
demon hidden inside the Vega logo that
reaches out grasping to suck the life
out of competing graphics cards I guess
not really sure alright and this is
where the graphics card self is we've
got one more little tucked-away piece on
the side here with oh well that's kind
of fun so we got the bring gaming to
life Vega wristband I should probably
put that on and then in here we have an
actual Vega GPU this is a dummy GPU so
it's not actually functional so kind of
similar to what they did with a thread
Ripper they're actually sending out even
got the balls on the bottom it's except
spider balls on the bottom as a BGA
actual Vega chip right there so you can
see the HBM two stacks right there an
actual Vega die
that's really cool to have I feel like I
should find a case or something like
that
to put this in as well yeah now though
some stickers are also included in here
and that does seem to be just about it
but that's a really cool add-on I really
like having a dummy GPU dies like just
have around for size comparisons and
they're just the fun thing to have it
you don't get some holes on to very
often all right now the actual GPU
inside this little case right here and I
do I have the air cooled version of
Vegas 64 right here oh yeah and again
just really plush a packaging here that
AMD has put together for this reviewers
kit and there we can see the Vegas 64
GPU and all of its glory this is the air
cooled Edition with the blower style fan
again which you guys probably have
already seen maybe a little bit since we
already kind of showed this at the
unboxing events that they had about a
week and a half ago there's a GPU tack
on that side so you can actually see
when the system is under load there's a
visual indication indicator if it right
there you can switch those gp2 tach
lights between red and blue so you can
have it match up with your system
lighting a little bit more if that's
something that you want to go for and
then for video outs over again this end
we have a three display port as well as
a full size HDMI
and a black back plate as well which I
think looks pretty cool there so there's
a quick look at the Radeon Vega 64
o'doole 810 PCI Express graphics power
connectors as well right in there and I
am going to get this installed start
testing it right away also there's a
little pixel or if you want to say it
properly a voxel right there a
volumetric pixel with the Radeon logo
it's on that corner as well and a really
cool looking card
hopefully it's actually cool as well
when it's actually tested and everything
like that but now that that's out of the
box I have one more to deal with all
right
box number one is handled let's move on
to Fox number two this one was slightly
less expected I think they were talking
about getting Vegas 56 out to people
this one's going to be a bit more
reasonably priced it's going to be 400
bucks assuming of course people to find
them at that price after launch actually
happens and we'll see cards get bought
up by like plain miners or that kind of
thing
but in the meantime at least we are
going to give you guys benchmarks when
when we're allowed to publish them but
this one is obviously a little bit more
like it doesn't have quite the same
plush packaging and everything but you
know it an early kit I am I'm still
stuck either way that I not only have
the Vegas 64 but I've also got the Vegas
56 and with this one since we have the
standard edition rather than the limited
edition we can actually give you a
little side-by-side comparison of the
two there's a quick side-by-side Vegas
64 Vegas 56 limited edition non limited
edition the non limited edition looks
very similar to what they did with the
feejee cards originally doesn't look bad
at all
definitely by any stretch a lot simpler
design as far as it's got just sort of a
plain black aesthetic for most of it a
bit of texture on the top as we have
also seen before but blower style ooh
again and we're not expecting that the
non special edition cards are going to
perform any less than the special
edition cards it's just you don't get
that brushed metal finish on the outside
and all that good stuff you do so get
functionally all the same stuff though
so you know again dual a pin power
connectors there at the top the GPU tech
lights with LEDs that you can again turn
on or off or switch between blue and red
and then just sort of a simpler design
overall with a little bit more plastic
involved than the metal that you get on
the special edition and then you do get
the same video outs at the bottom but
again
you don't get the black backplate on
there so you know just just doesn't look
quite as fancy as a special edition dual
item power connectors you know you
wouldn't expect anything different there
I either and then like that's all I can
tell you guys about these cards right
now I wish I could go into more depth
for these I can just not right now and I
can't even really tell you guys when
that's going to happen either but guys I
think in the interest of getting some
work done on these I'm going to switch
over to benchmarking mode and start
working on them I will be bringing you
some content on these with some
benchmarks very soon as soon as I'm
allowed to and of course before I go a
quick reminder just to let Steve know
that unboxings aren't completely useless
like you guys watch this video and I bet
you're smarter now I bet you know more
things and I bet your opinions of Vega
have been greatly impacted by the fact
that I just took these out of the box
and showed them to you
right anyway if you did enjoy this video
hit the thumbs up button let me know
what your feelings are on unboxing
videos like this in the comments below
and of course if you want to see more
videos and of course the coverage of
these commits very soon it's a subscribe
button on your way out as well thanks
again for watching guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
