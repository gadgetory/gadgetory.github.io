you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master all right guys I'm at the
enter max suite enter max as a sponsor
for my CES 2019 coverage so a big THANK
YOU to them and the Lighting's a little
weird in here because we have internal
lighting and external lighting and
there's a lot of RGB LEDs going on but
NR Max has some exciting new products
liquid coolers as well as cases let's
take a look so there's a room full of
hardware as you can see we're going to
start over here with liquid fusion now
we actually just built a system our CES
2019 editing rig features the local
vision local fusion 240 in there either
expanding and offering at 360 millimeter
version as well by popular demand so you
can have a 3 by 120 fans set up on there
also by popular demand enter max has
upgraded the fans so you're gonna get
addressable LED fans a ship with this
unit now that's for both the 240 and the
360 millimeter version and they also
have a little breakout here of their
cold plates this is their design on the
left and essentially as the liquid is
passing through the micro channels in
the cold plate if you have a solid
design like this you're gonna have more
resistance for the liquid flowing over
that as it gets further across so they
put a gap in the middle it helps to
reduce the resistance and the liquid can
flow more freely and give you better
cooling if you're interested in this 360
millimeter version it is one 39.99 it is
available now and yes it still has the
little flow indicator down there that
spins ever so gently as liquid flows
through this one's not on right now but
trust me it looks pretty oh and one
other thing and this is gonna be a theme
for these other liquid coolers that
we're looking at to andr excuse you
flexibility when you get one of these so
they ship a little control unit with it
that you can plug everything into so you
can could just control with the buttons
or it's got standard five volts three
pin addressable RGB headers so you can
plug directly into your motherboard and
control it with your software and I max
must be huge fans of Huey Lewis and the
news and they're hip to be square album
because look square fans fans are
normally circular the fans themselves to
be fair are still circles but they have
more of a square design with the RGB
LEDs going around the outside that is a
unique implementation so if you're
looking for a way to distinguish your
case from all of the non square RGB fans
that are out there you can check out
these square RGB fins that are now going
to be available from enter max other
interesting thing about these is they
produced a decent amount of airflow at
least anecdotally from pointing it at my
face and they have kind
a cool perforation that goes across the
back of these so if you happen to have
them installed on a radiator or just
somewhere where it's visible or the back
of the fan is visible you'll still see
your LEDs shining through you should be
available at the end of February they'll
come as a three fan pack for $79.99 that
will include the controller or you can
get the individual fan for twenty five
here's the new all-in-one liquid cooler
called aqua fusion as you can see
they're going with the fusion theme here
and this I'm gonna say is the prettiest
water block I've ever seen at least when
it comes to like ones that come with all
my liquid coolers they have what they're
calling an aura belt or the RGB ring
that's going around the outside of this
then they have sort of a step down
inside that the LEDs shine through
internally as well they're addressable
addressable of course that's giving it a
little bit of a light show there and I
don't know just visually speaking got
the inner max logo in the middle too I
just think that it's super pretty very
nice clean implementation there this is
gonna feature all the same stuff that I
already talked about with the other
coolers so you get an RGB controller
included it's gonna have the shunt
channel technology for the cold plates
and it's available in a 120 millimeter
or 240 millimeter versions the 120
millimeter version will be $90 the 240
millimeter version you see here will be
110 dollars and we're expecting these to
be available at the end of February
before I move over to cases did you know
any max has several patents on some of
the products that they produce now I
have shown you guys probably in the past
if you've watched any inner max videos
that their case fans pop off you can
remove the case fan and this is
absolutely amazing if you ever want to
get in there and do a full cleaning of
your system or I guess swap out your
case fans if you don't want clear ones
anymore you could also do that but
beyond that they also have a patent on
the LED ring ring around LED technology
I just made up that term but I'm sure
it's accurate
the LEDs that are internal around the
ring of the fan hub that shine
internally so that you can light up
things like the rings that they have on
their inner max fans that's also
patented so so take that and combine it
with the this modular design which they
have for putting around the LED ring
itself these are used in their TV RGB
fans this provides diffusion and then
also the plastic ring around there gives
you sort of a again a multi-tiered
effect which also looks quite nice
here's the inner max saber ray we
actually saw first saw this last year at
CES and it's launched at their flagship
case so their top end case it has really
cool RGB accents going all
the way from the back across two strips
across the top and then down the front
enter Mac's logo on the front lights up
to this is a new white version that just
launched and it comes with three of
those square RGB fans in the front for
the show they put one in the back as
well it'll ship with a standard non RGB
fan in the back too so you do get four
fans included with the case this build
looks super clean because they've
integrated all white products to you got
the animatics local tech 2 cooler 360
millimeter all in whites that's new show
you more in just a second also a
gigabytes graphics card with the white
back plate and some Patriot VIPRE memory
there too this white version is
available now it's going to cost you
$199 but again it comes with 4 fans and
then they're also throwing this in not
the monitor not the keyboard the stand a
little monitor stand it's available in
black and white so if you get the black
version of the case you will have it in
black you can tuck your keyboard back
underneath it and it's got a couple
little pull outs things a drawer right
there for random stuff and then a little
drop down here so you can store your
tablet or cell phone here is another
version of the sabre a this is the
savory advanced they're not expecting
this to be available till March but it
will be the same price as the white
version over there
this one's been upgraded though you now
have a type-c USB 3.1 gen2 port that's
in the front i oh right there
and they've also updated the way that
the side panel comes off and I gotta say
I think this is my favorite side panel
implementation for a tempered glass that
I've ever seen because I got to do is
push down on that little handle and it
pops up you can lift it off I like side
panels that you can remove without too
much difficulty and also without having
to like move the case out so if you have
a monitor or something up against here
and you don't have that much space you
can still remove the side panel lift it
out and away and it's just a very
convenient way to access the internals
there are five more cases to talk about
here but they can be kind of grouped
together so these four are all based on
the same internal chassis so I'll kind
of discuss those all together these are
all meant to be
RGB gaming cases and then you also have
the Makka XI over here this one's only
going to be $80 supports ATX form factor
motherboards it's got an RGB accent
across the front as well it's a little
bit more subtle especially if you
compare them to some of these some of
these that are over here tempered glass
side panel of course and you get support
for three sixty millimeter radiators in
the front as well as the top oh and yes
in case you're wondering that's a front
panel RGB panel
is addressable so that is also
compatible with the enter max control
box or you can plug that in directly to
the motherboard so now these four other
cases this is the Cancri E or CN 30 if
you want to say it a bit more simply
these are all just various ways that
animatics has implemented RGB lighting
on a very functional chassis so the
chassis itself supports 360 millimeter
radiators in the front 240 of 240
millimeter radiators and the top and a
standard ATX layout otherwise with a
power supply basement at the bottom but
as you can see we have a very vivid RGB
panel going across the front there's
even some point lighting that scatters
across there that's very interesting to
see another panel going across the power
supply at the shroud area right down
there and this can be customized so they
have a design going on right now but
they can work with system integrators or
other third parties who want to have
specially designed computer cases to do
a different design they showed me one of
a Japanese company that wants to have
like cherry blossoms going up there that
looked really pretty so you can imagine
they would also cover up a little bit
more of the RGB and let it shine through
in different ways so there's going to be
lots of different ways that this can be
implemented but this case it's only
going to be $80 this one here they've
dubbed the Leonids Ellyn 30 this one
also has an RGB strip across the front
they've also got the RGB accents across
the power supply basement at the bottom
as well this one's also only going to
cost you $80 both of these two cases
will ship with a single fan 120
millimeter so you can add more if you
want to bling it out like they've done
with this case here they've assembled
another awesome gaming system in there
with tons of RGB lighting so just
another taste of how this chassis can be
outfitted and you know if you don't like
that one maybe you like this one if you
don't like this one well maybe like one
of these so this is the core Acer C 130
again same internal chassis design but
here we have an acrylic window on the
front they've put some very bright 120
millimeter RGB LED fans
these are addressable as well and
they've included a fourth one in the
back these will cost you a little bit
more it's going to be $89.99 for the one
on the right $99.99 for the one on the
left but they will both ship with for
matching fans
these are dress apart GB clear fans on
the wall on the core Acer on the right
the c-130 and then for the starry forked
SF 30 we have more of these square RGB
fans that we already showed you this one
also has a nice implementation showing
off the LED accent on the power supply
char down there they
a custom-designed acrylic panel that is
separate from the upper tempered glass
panel by the way they just did this one
for the show but again just showing off
how you could do a customized acrylic
panel down there if you're not going
with something like that then it's got a
standard black panel that covers the
bottom power supply a shroud area I'd
like you can see with the core Acer
Animax also makes power supplies I've
used many of their power supplies in the
past they are all very high quality and
this is gonna be a really high-end one
in fact this one isn't even going to be
very useful for you if you're in the US
if you're in the US this is a 1600 watt
power supply because we're limited by
our power delivery system which is 120
volts if you're in the UK or the EU
you've got 240 well then it can go up to
1800 watts so if you have a mining farm
or something like that that's going to
be a great unit for you most power
supplies are rated for continuous
operation at 50 degrees Celsius
this one has a turbo switch so you can
push it like that it's going to crank
the fan speed up to 30 100 rpms and keep
things much chillier in there of course
it's going to make a little bit more
noise but if you are in an environment
where temperature keeping temperatures
low is a challenge that can run
continuously at 55 degrees Celsius and
rounding things out we have the liquid
tech - this is a special edition 360
millimetre radiator version these are
crazy coolers they have really high flow
rates on the pumps this can support TDP
heat dissipation of 500 watts which is
insane and it's got a really clean all
white version now which I think they've
done a great job on the sleeving here on
the tubing looks really nice they're
still maintaining the what they call
aura belts which is the RGB lighting
that goes around the edge of the actual
CPU pump block unit itself now there is
a liquid tech to tr4 version that's
specifically made for thread Ripper that
is only compatible with thread Ripper
and this is only compatible with
everything except thread Ripper so if
you are trying to cool a thread Ripper
processor make sure you get the tr4
version but the liquid tech 2 is now
available for all variety of Intel
sockets as well as AMD am-3 and m4 and
available in multiple sizes so 242 80
360 this is going to be 139 149 159 and
then I heard in 69 for the special
edition white version of that but guys
that's all the time I have for here at
the inner max Suites we're at the
Venetian
by the way in case I didn't mention
