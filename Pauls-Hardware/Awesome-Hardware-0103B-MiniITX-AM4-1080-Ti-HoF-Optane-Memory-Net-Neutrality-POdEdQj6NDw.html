- both yeah we're live welcome guys he's
inside B of Awesome Hardware episode 103
the live show that Paul and I do every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
if you guys are chilling with us right
now and you haven't seen part one you
can go ahead and watch it on my channel
youtube.com slash c / bit wit or you can
find the link in paul's description of
his youtube video if you're watching
this on Twitch welcome back it's
accurate but because you're doing well
and we've got a hell of a show for you
guys today Paul has planted he's spent
all morning and all afternoon and
evening crafting the show he said Tower
is gonna be the best show he's ever done
our Xander everything you're about to
see represents his full potential as a
live streamer so stay tuned it's going
to be a hell of a hell of a ride your
life will never be the same
you'll be forever changed be a spiritual
moment we'll all share together and
we'll all cry at the end so um such
beautiful
yes absolutely tear-jerking already and
oh we got a gamer's nexus article yes we
talked about lots of good stuff here um
glorious
we are still drinking beer I'm still
working on my delirium tremens that Paul
got for his birthday you've started on a
new beer what is that this is by Ninkasi
Brewing Company mm-hmm this was actually
a present from my sister and her family
for my birthday I think my brother's not
and their family this is a vanilla Otis
oatmeal stout and it's climb stations
quite good yummy if you finish that you
can have some of this I will I will I
will eventually okay I'm still sipping
on the DT so yes cheers to all you guys
thanks for being here yes and we have
the best live show ever it's the best
show say I'm just going to say we do
curse from time to times fair warning to
you guys who are sensitive to that kind
of thing we're going to talk about
technology we got gonna argue stuff
going to discuss things and we're going
to start off with of course the tech
news as we always do because we end the
first half with tech news we begin the
second half with tech news and that's
how it dovetails together to create a
seamless show that everyone
loves good lord
I'd say I'm very secure in Texas hell
yeah we all love gamers next
they're good they do good work they try
to do everything super legit
we kind of know they do stuff but yeah
they can a little debt so you guys
didn't already know you can take your
existing RX 480 or rx 470 if you happen
to have one of these cards from AMD you
can download a V bios v bios from the
internets files and then you can install
that onto your graphics card and
basically turn it from a 480 into a 589
for my 470 into a 570 and it's kind of
fun
it does that by increasing the amount of
voltage that's provided the GPU as well
as a few other parameters that are in
there that's just one thing that you
should know it's I would say if you have
a duel with a GP with dual BIOS ease
which some there are some that are out
there that have that I think sapphire I
want to say has one and there's a couple
others yeah but curricular me you can
even beyond that even without doing the
BIOS flashing thing you can still take a
580 and a 480 and crossfire them
together yeah why not because in the
same a GPU yeah it's the same GPU inside
show so you're able to do that so you
don't even need to flash the BIOS on the
480 to know to work it'll it'll just
yeah I would imagine you could flash the
best in the 480 and then be interesting
to see if that improves performance any
it might because when you do run these
in crossfire if you happen to do so like
gamers Nexus did here they will run at
the frequency of the slowest GPU yeah so
updating your for you to a 5 8 or
something like that might cause it to
run at a higher frequency and so I might
and give you better performance they
didn't test in that configuration they
just dressed it with a 40 and a 580 they
were testing with MSI's cards either
their gaming X or whatever whatever the
hell that is they said that there is no
explicit inhibitor to forbid users from
writing crossfire with an Rx 400 was
alright what Jesus I don't like to hear
myself talk yeah it's really awkward
it's I feel sound I feel very
self-conscious now good but anyway
there's no explicit inhibitor they say
from running these cards in crossfire
with the 400 and 500 CS cards as long as
you use a 470 and a 5
or 480 and 580 now the frequency again
will be matched to the slowest card and
then of course you're going to have
you're going to have you're going to
give up something for running across
fire most notably is going to be the
amount of power that's drawn so they're
tests that they ran in fire strike
extreme and for honor showed a pretty
significant jump up and power draw it
was something like fifty four percent
higher power compared to just running
the stock for eighty thirty-seven
percent more power than running a stock
five eighty this test by the way we're
around on a seventy seven hundred K
based system and they also ran a bunch
of games so they did finds and I'm going
to briefly scroll through these games
just articles linked in the description
if you guys want to take a closer look
at this but they did find that when
scaling took effect that it was a pretty
nice performance bump and in fact it was
scoring between a gtx 1080 and 1080 TI's
amount of performance pretty damn good
considering that at an eighty cost 500
bucks yeah today's yeah ti cost 650
maybe 700 yeah that's pretty decent
however that was not always the case
because crossfire does not always scale
across everything right where it did
scale well will sweetie mark and Sniper
Elite for when it didn't work and could
potentially even have negative scaling
as it did in Mass Effect Andromeda yes
where the 580 and 480 scores are down
here at the bottom but you can see here
below just the 580 by itself or just the
480 by itself yeah that's occurred in
different at different resolutions as
well also had negative scaling in Ghost
Recon wildlands and then there were also
other situations where it had awkward
scaling like it scaled well at 1080 and
1440 at least scaled okay at 1080 and
1440 I'm sorry is it I'm sorry is this
before or after he flashed the bios for
the art he never flashed the best in
this I was I was mentioning as bringing
that up as just sort of a tangent easily
linked okay a topic to this gadget this
is just a 480 and 580 crossfire together
go to yes and for honor though for for
some reason
there was some good scaling at 1440 and
1080 but when they ran it at 4k it was
like a stuttering mess and they couldn't
even really test it says come with
multi-gpu stuff yes all this is to say
interest it is something you can do it's
not something that would be like hey
everyone go and get this configuration
and set it up if you have a specific
game that scales well and you see people
benchmarking and it works well and you
really like that game then maybe it's
something to go for but by-and-large
probably not something you should
consider but interesting that it can be
done yeah yeah cool I wonder how long it
takes gamers Nexus to make these graphs
just long data long time they don't
sleep that they head out oh I don't know
the word they never really never sleep
who needs it okay we sort of discussed
this a little bit on Kyle's half of the
show but SK Hynix has just announced
that they have GDD our sixth memory for
GPUs that is in the works and on the way
it's expected to launch in 2018 and
theoretically they are going to be
teaming up with Nvidia to use this type
of memory with their Volta based GPU
which again we kind of discussed in
Cal's half of the show but I really
quickly rattle off some of these specs
these memory chips would be eight
gigabit chips which would be about one
gigabyte of actual gddr5 six memory per
chip which to me means that you could
have it in configurations if you have
eight packages per side on a graphics
card you could probably theoretically
have up to 16 gigs of this on a single
graphics card with the specs that
they're currently listing which would be
kind of interesting 16 gigs of DDR 6 I
mean we've already got like tight nexus
with 12 gigs so yeah increasing it from
there that's not a bad thing it's going
to be manufactured on a twenty-something
menu nanometer manufacturing process
SK Hynix isn't saying specifically they
said 2x nanometer which means anything
between 20 and 29 each chip is going to
have an IO data rate of 16 gigabits per
second per pin which is the world's
fastest according to the article the
memory interface is 384 bits
providing 768 gigabytes per second of
bandwidth that would be compared to like
a gddr5 X in the 1080i right now which
runs at 480 444 768 hot damn take it
yep faster and in case you're curious
about competition not just SK Hynix but
also micron it has been at least
mentioning production of GD GD d r6 and
getting that underway by the end of the
year so cool we need fast memory for
graphics cards and we need more of its
because memory prices have been going up
the important to see oh god oh god the
dog oh god oh god honks it'll be kind of
cool to see the difference between the
micron GFI or to do 6 and SK Hynix GTR 6
yeah and to see if there's any sort of
discrepancy between those like which one
works really well which one explodes
with rising processor which one explodes
which one works really well rising
processors which one combust them
beforehand but run just personally
that's never had okay all right next up
in the news segment we're going to talk
a little bit about net neutrality and
just to clarify right out of the gate
here we do not aim to make a political
show we don't usually delve into
politics and we don't talk about
politics that said politics affect the
FCC and therefore have sort of a
trickle-down effect on the topics that
we usually talk about here on the show
therefore some of this might but might
might overlap just slightly so our
apologies but also just to point out
when we discuss stuff like FCC and net
neutrality we've been doing this show
for a few years now back in 2015 when
the FCC chair was Tom wheeler who was
appointed I he was at least a you at
least FCC chair under under Obama I'm
not sure if he was specifically
appointed by Obama but anyway point is
we were better very critical of him as
well until he actually
when prudence decision to classify
intranet communications and data
transfers under title 2 creativity
basically yeah which was the right
decision
so that is to say that right now FCC is
not run by Tom wheeler anymore chairman
of the FCC's as you tie this guy seems
like it tunes well actually if you read
articles about him as he's supposed to
be a really nice guy in person but I was
the devil that doesn't mean that he
can't necessarily be in the pocket of
Internet service providers so net
neutrality uh yeah Oishi pie is Trump's
FCC chair was appointed by Trump back in
January he's going to deliver a speech
that's titled
the future of internet regulation on
Wednesday in Washington and the reason
that this might concern you or me or
anyone who uses the internet on a
regular basis it's because net
neutrality rules are at stake
classification of the Internet as a
title to utility is also at stake they
might roll that back it's expected to
announce that he's going to begin the
process of taking public comments to
repeal the rules approved by the by the
FCC under President Barack Obama in
early 2015
so public comments is something that we
encourage lots of people to do and
comment on and let the FCC know about
when they were originally considering
this back in 2015 this apparently
something that will be required once
again is for lots of people to let it be
known if they want their internet
treated in such a way that all data will
be treated equally and then we don't
have internet fast lanes or the
possibility of stuff being done what
basically the idea that data that comes
from one location might be treated
differently than data that comes from
another location taking public comment
does that mean like like petitions and
stuff like that or just people people
can submit comments they set up website
people can say comment section yeah
people can say I don't think you should
have net neutrality rules because I am
in the pocket of an Internet service
provider or you should have net
neutrality should be established because
I'm a reasonable person and I want to
pay more for my my internet bill YUM
okay
well hopefully they listen
hopefully they listen if you guys won't
have a discussion with anyone who you
might talk to because I think that's
what's really important right now is
discussing these types of topics with
people who may not fully understand them
compare it to Daleks know just compared
to Netflix comparable and compare it to
how cable works so you can bring Netflix
into it but compared to how cable works
right now if you're watching our show
chances are you have an internet
connection
and you pay in an Internet service
provider a certain dollar amount per
month in order to have that connection
to the Internet usually it's around 40
to 100 bucks in the u.s. is what you
typically pay depending on how much
bandwidth you actually have but it also
depends on whether you have the ability
to choose between multiple internet
service providers that's another thing
that the rollback of these rules will
affect is the ability to have
competition in your area and competition
by the way is not competition between
Verizon who provides your cellphone plan
and Comcast who provides your wired
connection to your house but the way
they're changing things will say like oh
there is competition there because
there's a cellphone provider and an
internet provider which isn't the way it
should work because those do not
necessarily overlap but they're
adjusting the rules to make things more
favorable for the Internet service
providers if you want to compare this to
how cable works basically look at it
this way let's take a handful a small
collection of your favorite places to go
on the Internet's and let's say let's
say we collect the ones that are going
to use the most amount of data like
let's say YouTube and maybe a couple
other websites that are your favorite to
go to but also happen to use a lot of
data YouTube Netflix may be one or two
others your internet service provider if
net neutrality rules aren't in place
could potentially say we want to make
those specific websites part of our
premium plan and you can pay us your
basic rate for internet connection but
you know what these specific sites that
you like to go to a lot that use a lot
of bandwidth because
use a lot of bandwidth or because we
just want to charge people money those
now you need to pay it to be part of our
premium tier of service like you would
with a cable plan where you have to pay
oh well if you want to HBO and Cinemax
and these premium channels you got to
pay this for this package means you know
what we're charging you an extra 30
bucks a month for that because it's a
package with a bunch of websites in it
and maybe you don't want to go to like
90% of those websites but the two that
you really want to go to you got to pay
for those now that's the way the cable
has worked for quite a long time and
that's the way that the internet doesn't
work and that's what makes the internet
great is it because you can pay a single
fee for all the data that comes in and
out over the line and and and then you
can access the Internet and go to the
websites you want to go to and access
the information that you want to go to
and that's why it's such a strong
competitor to cable in general and it's
wisest this chord cutter movements for
people who are just cutting the cord and
not even having a cable connection at
all because they get all the information
and entertainment and whatever that they
need over the internet property anyway
so that was it that was a beautiful rant
thank you it was one of those actually
insightful and productive rants that
we've ever had on this I'm trying and
Chinese very I'm trying to annunciate
yes but I'm really trying to try really
hard not to act bust so uh that was
beautiful the FCC said potentially hold
an initial vote on this proposal at the
FCC's May 18th meeting the rules
approved by the FCC in 2015 prohibit
broadband providers from giving or
selling access to speedier internet or
essentially a fast lane certain internet
services over others reclassifying
Internet service providers much like
utilities and federal courts approved
this because the ISPs appealed it's and
earlier this year federal courts upheld
it however as you PI wants to change all
of this these things internet providers
this is a quote directly internet
providers like AT&amp;amp;T Verizon
Communications and Comcast have argued
net neutrality rules make it harder to
manage Internet traffic and investment
in additional capacity would be less
likely however losses the quote from
what who
to quote from um this quote is from the
article okay yes the Bates V these
basically saying the internet providers
have said that under net neutrality like
there's there's going to be less
investment in Internet infrastructure
however if you look at the past year
when it has been classified as title two
that's completely like BS yeah it's been
perfectly article here from consumerist
which has the very specific specifics
such as that many of the nation's
largest broadband providers have grown
in the last two years since February 26
2015 which is when the title to
classification went into effect ATT
share prices have increased more than 20
percent Comcast's is that 26% Verizon's
is at the same level although it's
fluctuated fifteen percent in either
direction charters is up forty percent
the only company that is down is
CenturyLink they are down 50%
I assume that's because their shetty isp
infrastructure spending 2016 vs. 2015
Comcast's is up 7.9% AT&amp;amp;T is up ten
point six percent charter and Time
Warner is confusing because they merge
together during that time period but
they spent 7.5 billion in 2016 which is
more than charter and Time Warner
provide spent individually pre-merger
it's kind of funny how these ISPs are
arguing that net neutrality is going to
harm them when like you said like when
you were comparing it to the the cable
situation like look at where cable is
now compared to the Internet
yeah like it's being it's being
overshadowed by the internet because the
internet up to this point has has people
would rather neutrality go to youtube
and watch some stuff that they want to
watch and not deal with the BS of you
know fast forwarding through commercials
or whatever the heck else they want to
do there's alternative ways of accessing
information and accessing entertainment
and these are companies that are trying
to push back and use outdated methods of
charging people money to give them that
information and also provide a
artificial bottlenecks because they
don't want to upgrade their
infrastructure when that neutrality is
in effect there is a competition that's
created and that's why we're seeing in
and that's why we're seeing investment
in infrastructure
yeah that's why also that we're seeing
the proliferation of stuff like
unlimited data plans and stuff like that
part of that is competition because
t-mobile Thank You t-mobile for doing
unlimited data plans competition but
ultimately all this is to say is that
the actions that are being taken by a
Jeep I are very much helping Internet
service providers and are doing nothing
to help people who are at home who use
the internet on a daily basis and
they're going to provide Internet
service providers with means of charging
people more money and they're also going
to disincentivize Internet service
providers for upgrading the networks
that they have in place and improving
the networks that they have in place to
give people more bandwidth and more of
what they need because by creating an
artificial limitation on the amount of
bandwidth that's available they can
charge more for it which is basic
economics yeah um it's up yeah
Jeep I was Rick Rolled
this is it my protesters my protesters
so just just to point out it's not just
us ranting about this kind of thing but
some net neutrality advocates actually
went into a Thursday's FCC monthly open
meeting and they stood up and sang a
song that was they rear it they rewrote
Rick the rickroll yeah s actual song
never gonna give up and yeah and they
did it at the thing which is which is
cute I guess and yeah I mean this is
it's frustrating because like his
comments the the quote that I read you
before was based on data provided by us
telecom which is the Internet service
providers lobbying arm like it's just
very very obvious that he is very much
in their pocket yeah and it's very
frustrating to see actions being taken
that are very anti consumer because just
characters because this this part of the
government is supposed to be there to
protect consumers right and give people
the ability to do more to run businesses
on the internet and stuff like that so
yeah one last thing before we move on
this this is the this is
closing that this was posted by fight
for the future which is a Twitter
account you can follow they post a lot
of stuff about net neutrality and that
kind of thing but this is a billboard
that was posted by American commitment
ABS company which is apparently backed
by the Koch brothers yes
 yes they're an anti
net neutrality group and they posted
this side near the FCC that said in 2015
above and the tech socialists stole the
internet from the people now we must
take it back Wow
I like which is completely flip cited in
in face that is eliminate title 2
regulation which is obviously a bunch of
garbage though eliminate net neutrality
bring net neutrality back yeah that's
exactly what that ad says American
commitment good lord
alright Sarris that's that's probably
about as much serious content as we can
handle from one episode yep you know
that's my montage of puppies no okay ah
good something else how about you hook
up with the white rhino on tinder a
white Wow yes and northeast would have
no northern white rhino more educational
okay there he is
his name is Sudan this is a how does he
swipe life this is legitimate no he's
gotta you gotta swipe white right on
Sudan okay so this is a new campaign
launched on Tuesday tinder has partnered
with the old peshitta Conservancy in
central Kenya to introduce users to
Sudan who is a northern white rhino he's
actually the last noir that he's the
world's first black last right northern
white rhino in existence male at least
there are two females that are left as
well ah so this is Sudan the females
name sir Nagi and and Fatou
however he has been unable to breed with
them due to a number of issues including
old age and low sperm count no and we've
all been there artificial insemination
do that though that's what they're
working on so
this program with tender so Dan miss
Leveaux so you might see Sudan pop up on
your tender feet if you're scrolling
through there you know looking for the
ladies or whatever and if you swipe
right on Sudan it will and it will take
you over to a place where you can donate
and they're trying to raise I believe
something in the area of nine million
dollars Wow to help with their IVF intro
in converting true B in vitro in vitro
in vitro fertilization attempts said
Lord yeah it's not cheating even for
humans it's not cheap yeah it's very
expensive yeah they're also our southern
white rhinos apart from the northern
white rhinos they are distinct
subspecies but they're potentially may
double mud yeah the potentially other
options for interspecies mating there
yeah the Sultan right right white rhinos
are not quite as endangered interracial
rival to learn but Sudan is 42 years old
ideas we're all looking forward to that
speaking of which that does the article
did say that they seem to have collected
a fair amount of his semen so that there
might be potential for you know to
create more rhinos in the future with
that yeah I had to be like how you
collect rhino semen what I just want you
what was what's involved what is a day
in life of a rhino fluffer look like I
want I want just a not I don't need a
visual
I don't need video or anything of that I
just wanted eight I just want it talked
through 240 step-by-step and kind of
explained to me what's involved there so
what happens if the northern white rhino
mates with a southern white rhino then
in create create a central white rhino
then possibly what where does it go a
moderate white rhino I just drop it in
the middle of Africa and just see which
way it goes I would choose its own fate
I don't know it said it would it is an
option it would be better to do that
than it would be to lucky in the
northern white rhino species go extinct
yeah but it would not be a pure purebred
purebred northern white Rams got that
needs help getting it up he does he
needs my exit and
brings all of your moral support anyway
penis support let's move on to hot and
heavy hardware hot and heavy talk about
some hardware that's hot heavy huh I
guess that pretty much is it that's all
you find it with starting with an
article here from the Guru of 3d the
Galax GeForce GTX 1080 TI
whoo now the name yeah of course fastest
single GPU is currently available from
Nvidia right now this is a Hall of Fame
edition from Galax it's got a white PCB
it's got an all white cooler it has of
course the over-the-top power delivery
the galaxy always does with their Hall
of Fame additions that backplate that's
a nice-looking backplate I kind of like
that nice this guys like silver but this
is a by the with the quasar zone is
where the pictures come from so this is
a watermark not part of the back plate
by the way mmm Hall of Fame logo right
here is though so yeah 16 plus
three-phase power delivery on this thing
this crown across the top is LED lights
up in LEDs RGB not clarified whether or
not it's it's a RGB or not I feel like
it will yet I feel like it would be yeah
but who knows uh 3/8 pin PCI Express
power connectors good lord this
ridiculous good lalala marmots preparing
green 8 pins 3/8 Jesus and then of
course it is a triple slot design as you
can see here from the profile views um
not a whole lot of exhaust here going on
in the back they listen very minimal
it's an open ear here oh yeah yeah
they're mainly go for that there's no
that's gonna cool there's that triple 8
8 pin power delivery so Justin my opaque
monstrous card here you can see the 16
plus three-phase power delivery here as
well geez on the the board shot and yeah
I really like the white PCBs that they
do on the hall-of-fame cards they're
they're very they're very cool look very
nice
galux makes the best white video cards
so yeah there's there's pictures of this
now speculation as to when it launches
who knows
galux has also been known to wait a very
long time after a GPU actually launches
to actually
launched their special version of that
GPU but hey they got all these pictures
so maybe soon yeah
maybe soon all right next up intel has
launched octane
this happened yesterday morning was when
the embargo lifted obtain memory I
should say obtain memory because obtain
refers to a family of products from
Intel based on 3d crosspoint technology
obtain memory is very specifically these
little 32 and 16 gig Wow look how big
that dude drives and dot 2 drives yes
big picture right there this article is
from PC perspective is written by Allen
Melvin tano and in my opinion not that I
read all of these obtain memory articles
on the web but I think this one is
really really good so again if you guys
want to check it out
it's liked in the description so 3d
crosspoint won't really go into but it's
brand-new technology
it's essentially a replacement slight
NAND flash the NAND flash chips that you
have unlike an SSD you would use 3d
crosspoint packages instead and it
serves the ultimate function of storing
bits of data just like NAND would do
however it boasts a bunch of improved
features like really really fast
response time 10 micro second response
time as compared to modern flat NAND
flash which is about 90 microsecond
response time the product actually
launched by Intel today is for consumers
for people at home and there's two
options a 16 gig and a 32 32 gig version
of this that costs either 44 or 77
dollars now if you're like why the hell
would I want a 16 gig SSD or the 32 gig
SSD would be a good question cash money
Intel is setting these up as cache
drives so that is what obtain memory
refers to obtain memory is the caching
function solution that Intel has created
you could buy these drives and plug them
in and simply use them as a 16 gig SSD
or a 32 gig SSD constantly and alan in
this article does take two 32 gig ones
and plug them in and raid them up
together
which is kind of interesting and we'll
take a look at least if you love their
of his performance numbers from these
but let's let's let's get back down to
the point here which is that Alice was
very impressed he was comparing this to
the P 4800 X which is the $1500
Enterprise version of Intel's octane
technology which is an optin SSD
quality-of-service
is what it comes down to with these
drives you have to look very
specifically at the very very small
percentage of failures that the drives
do quality of service in the 99th
percentile 99.9 percent i'll 99.99% i'll
and 99.999% i'll you're looking at the
very very very few results that were
shitty is basically what you're doing
here which in a server environment makes
a lot of sense which is why the P the P
1400 was the name of the P 4800 X is a
really cool product now taking that and
translating it over to usefulness for
consumers at home who are setting this
up as a cash drive it's harder to
translate if you read this art the whole
article you will find very very glowing
terms that Alan describes this these
drives in because the performance is
really really good but the way that you
measure that performance is in very just
much more specific scenarios where
you're looking at again the very very
smallest number of actions that are
taken by the drive that take the longest
amount of time when he's looking at
quality of service so I would encourage
you guys to take a look at this article
if you're interested in more there is
also something to be said about powered
power drama because these drives do use
less power even SATA drives something in
the range of 2 to 2.5 watts versus SATA
drives that can use around five or six
watts and all this is to say that
ultimately what they're being used for
is cash drives
so like the way the weird thing is like
we went we went to a tech day for this
and the way Intel pitched these to us
was like look at all of these people who
are still using computers based on hard
drives I'm like okay yeah and they're
like yeah you a lot more than you then
you would expect because we use SSDs you
guys if you watch our shows probably use
SSDs but Intel's like actually there's a
lot of people still on hard drives like
ok those people could really benefit
from this ok you're probably right
and as Alan test Alan's test show using
one of these opt-in drives and pairing
it up with a hard drive really good
performance they're very good at caching
they're very intelligent and how they
cache the information and after you do
something a few times making it much
much faster much of the same way to
Intel Smart Response technology worked 3
4 5 years ago when they first introduced
that with it which I think was with like
p67 and sandy sandy sandy bridge however
I compared this to something like an SSD
the simplicity of buying a single SSD
and the level of expectation you'd have
in actual measurable real-world
performance from a person sitting and
using a computer versus something
happening in 10 microseconds versus 90
microseconds the responsiveness you get
with an SSD is already there by and
large for the most part I think what
this product actually is is Intel's
attempt at making a consumer part that
doesn't cannibalize their enterprise
part because they have enterprise parts
that use obtain they use 3d cross points
that are very fast that are more in the
reasonable use range as far as capacity
goes with like 375 gigabytes or I think
they go up to 750 and beyond that if
Intel was to take 3d crosspoint and
throw it in a consumer drive and give
you like hey here buy a 256 gig intel
SSD based on 3d crosspoint I think they
would be very much hurting their
enterprise business because if it's the
same technology if it had it's still the
same it has the same durable
that's one of the great advantages of 3d
crosspoint as well as durability so I
think this is kind of a stopgap way of
actually taking the technology and
selling it to people in such a way that
yes well will help some people but it's
such a niche benefit again it's going to
benefit people with hard drive who are
using hard drives right now it only
works with Intel Z 270 and KB Lake yeah
that's so you can't take this and take
someone with a four-year old system and
drop it in and use it like here upgrade
to your cache rat which I think would be
a great use case for something like this
you have to have Z 217 KB Lake yeah
which means you're buying a whole new
system which means your benefit for most
people who are stuck on hard drives I
feel like it's really thrown out the
window
what's something like this so yeah it
only makes sense if it's an upgrade in
your in your few year old system right
otherwise it's like why not just build a
full system from the ground up and just
replace your hard drive with an SSD the
larger capacity this makes sense if you
have like a laptop with just a hard
drive in it and it's getting slow and
you know if they're really targeting
this at people that are still in hard
drives here in 2017 they're obviously
not super tech savvy so they're probably
also the same kind of person that
wouldn't want to migrate all the data on
your hard drive over to a brand new SSD
Intel can just be like look just take
this just add it to your existing
hardware and it's all taken care of you
don't have to transfer files over from
one drive to another you just pop this
in it's just a little add-on but you
can't even do that because it's
requiring you to upgrade to a modern gen
platform this which I yeah so yeah silly
pairing an octane memory SSD with a hard
drive will make that hard drive for form
like an SSD that's kind of cool
pairing it with a sort of mid-level
mediocre performance SSD will make that
SSD perform faster as well that's also
kind of cool what if you up from any
update for me though I'd rather just buy
a 250 gig SSD or a 500 gig SS
the straight up right out of the gates
I'm very interested in consumer based
regular capacity drives based on opting
in the future obtain memory I don't I
don't see I don't see a huge place for
that in the current landscape again for
the reasons we've discussed so there we
go
but again guys check out the article if
you want because I get Alan did a really
good job testing it out he even like
tested against floppy drive and you
aren't you doing a video on obtain soon
Paul no oh why this was my video a nap
teen Vincent all the coverage it really
needs I covered up teen I covered up
teen right after I went to the events
this is true and yeah and that's that
was sufficient and tell segment Intel
sent me a system with an octane drive in
it which I was like why don't you just
send me the opt-in Drive they sent me
the system I owe it I don't have I don't
have anything to do with it we'll figure
it out later anyway alright Biostar is
launching mini ITX am for motherboards
we've kind of discussed this a little
bit there appear to be closer to launch
ready to launch maybe these are going to
be available now I looked at tried to
find these on Amazon and Newegg just
before the show started and I was not
able to find them but all that said hey
my auntie axiom for boards why would you
need an X 370 mini ITX board that's a
good catch analogy PU there's no point
for it but never mind that mini ITX am
for boards yay yeah that's gonna in
itself so they have two of these the bio
star racing X 370gt N and B 350gt n the
one shown here is B I can't tell if
you're heavy
can you tell just look sugar is there a
label on here anywhere says how you know
it's b4 here you just leave locator no
there there little bear the exact same
layout they're like the exact same board
kept saying some pictures with like one
of the heatsinks was yellow they added
color that must be the more expensive
one potentially but I'm totally it could
be totally wrong they're not really sure
they could have changed the design oh
that one's only gonna four pin CPU for
interesting maybe I wonder if the X 370
has eight pin well both of these are
going to
support 95 watt and for processor so
that will go up to your 1800 X level
ddr4 speeds up to 3200 megahertz
there is an m dot 232 gigabit gigabit
per second 20 to 60 or 20 to 80 slot
it's on the back which is not visible in
these pictures because there's only a
picture of the Front's there is a
picture of the i/o there look on the
other both dubia or pen it looks like
yeah aesthetically they look exactly the
same
yes I'm sure ok umm yeah it has a 50/50
LED Funzone with dual 5050 LED headers
honest which is as you know RGB right
cuz everything needs RGB to 2 LED
hitters though I mean I guess some
people might be interested in that their
software is called vivid LED DJ and I
don't want to ever use it in my life if
I can avoid it just because the name I'm
sorry the LED software that I've had to
deal with has been mediocre - okay and I
really don't have high hopes for bio
stars version of that nevertheless the
ex 370gt n is $129 the be 350gt n is
$109 don't bother with the x3 70 because
the x3 70 gives you capability to have
two-way crossfire and SLI support which
you have no access to on a mini ITX
board so never pay 20 extra bucks for an
x3 70 version of this board you should
only ever buy the beauty export for that
matter yeah there's supposed to be an x3
7 X 300 chipset for a m4 but we haven't
seen any boards based on it yet but that
would be a more sensible chipset to use
for motherboard all that said BIOS tour
has obviously put in a lot of effort to
be the first with a name for mini ITX
board and who knows maybe you'll be able
to actually buy them at retail soon we
don't really know it's launched it's not
launched I'm not sure geez AOC and
Porsche geez two names that go together
like I don't know what they go together
like but hey new monitors by OSI and
Porsche se has actually a couple new
monitors there they look like this they
were code designed with Porsche studio
at a Porsche to be specific
why is Porsche in on this I don't know
it reminds me of
Thermaltake collaborating with BMW
design works USA for their original
level 10 design you remember that yeah I
remember that anyway though these are
the PDS 2 for 1 and PDS 2 7 1 24 and 27
inch monitors respectively they do look
fancy but the specs are decidedly
pedestrian 250 candles 4 meter square
maximum brightness thousand to 1
contrast ratio there eh IPS screens
they're only 1920 by 1080 resolution
though 4 millisecond response time and
60 Hertz refresh rate so they've taken a
mediocre somewhat passable screen and
put it in what appears to be like a
fancy designed circular around stand
thing that was designed by Porsche this
belongs in like a modern medical office
yes yeah it's very thin as you can see
here so there are no rooms for actual
usable ports on there so there's a
little breakout box you can kind of see
in this picture right here that contains
the power plug in a single HDMI port
which is how you connect its sign in the
back it connects that's the breakout box
with the plug on it connects to the base
via a type-c connector a USB type-c
connector as far as they could tell at
least and it also looks like one of
those stupid designs it doesn't have a
base amount on it because they made it a
fancy slim design
so that's screw would just go straight
through the monitor yeah just straight
to the monitor I hate monitors that have
fancy looking stands that don't have
base amounts on the monitor themselves
these will be released in June 240 and
$330 respectively for the 2 to 24 and 27
inch version and I mostly brought this
up to tell people don't buy them don't
do it
yes yay time for sword fight yay sort by
circuit so fight you Kyle and I argue
about things ok I'm uh we're gonna start
off with the is this oh yeah
we'll start off with this here Google is
creating ad blocking software there's
conspiracy theories about why are you
doing that why would they do that Kyle
because they're Google they can do
whatever they want you want to do that
you're trying to psych us out yeah I'm
probably trying to think that probably
are
get us to think that they've gone crazy
that's true making us underestimate them
until they fire back with their
self-aware machines
blocking all the ads I think you're I
think you've probably got a pretty good
idea of what's going on your cow but
yeah
what is scuttlebutt has it that Google
is working on ad blocking software that
will be actually integrated directly
into Chrome so there's details here the
article discusses we're not going to
worry about those we're just going to
argue about this should Google be
allowed to make it ad blocker and
integrate it with Chrome what do you
think yes yes but isn't that kind of
Google it makes money - no it's clearly
conflict of interest or no because I
really like existing adblock options and
they don't need competition what do you
think cap oh I'm gonna say yeah I don't
care
yeah go ahead make an ad blocker I have
this theory that their ad blocker won't
actually block ads like like people
still get paid and we'll still charge
advertisers even though people are using
their adblock I still have some kind of
weird some sanity tell the advertisers
that the ad was viewed but then not
actually show the ad
exactly I'd be pretty yeah which which
works for us right because we're
youtubers ands like all of our all of
our viewers are like dude it's like
I'm wasted like I've got YouTube read
but I don't even pay 10 bucks a month
for it don't have to view ads and we're
still like like everyone wins you know
the only one who doesn't win is the
advertisers but screw them they've been
winning for long enough I say implement
the shady Google adblock and we win we
get more money don't you like money Paul
Vince you like more of it for yourself
I do like more money then try to argue
against it right now okay so I'm
assuming you were saying yes yes a
thousand times yes so I'm gonna say yes
but isn't isn't ads how Google makes
money - because that's the weird thing
that stood out to me about this is
because Google is largely based on ads
google has created an entire business
based on one being able to provide
information to people and to being able
to attach some form of advertisements to
that information which I mean I use
Google products and I use Google
services because I think it's a fairly
reasonable trade-off I don't mind being
shown an ad here there for something if
it means that I can get something for
free i watch youtube videos and i watch
a brief ad beforehand and you know what
I don't mind
liking my mind out for ten seconds or
whatever or ignoring whatever stupid ad
shows there because I don't typically
like to watch ads and then getting on
with whatever the heck is shown there
it's a reasonable business model that
makes money for the parties that are
involved and gives some exposure to the
people who are providing ads so that's
what doesn't make sense to me so yes I'd
like to see that happen because who
doesn't like a nice ad blocker
integrated into your browser at least as
long as you have the capability to
whitelist specific websites specifically
mean cows YouTube channels um I think
that's fine yeah so alright what if it
only blocked like non Google ads
that would be see that again that would
be answer three clearly a compliment
idea quite quite quite clearly indeed
okay results from what people say I
think so far I win you in this an ads
how Google make money too but most
people most people do want it so yeah
it'll be nice to have it there but
there's some weird questions about this
this wasn't an article that I went into
completely in depth but it is linked in
the description if you guys want to read
about it a little bit more and of course
if you didn't have a chance to vote
right now or if we are looking at the
votes too quickly these straw polls will
still be open if you got to continue to
vote cool next up here's an article from
motherboard vice.com specifically about
Apple and Apple repair companies the
companies like the license at Apple
license Apple repair service companies
it's been revealed by some documentation
from their their their program that they
have to work with the licensed Apple
repair service companies the basically
Apple has a very specific
exclusions for recycling just in that
you're not allowed to recyclers have to
shred all iPhones and MacBooks you're
not allowed to reuse them you're not
allowed to harvest parts from them to
repair other devices you're not allowed
to resell them at all
you just got to shred them up divide
them into their constituent base
components and then I assume go on
the environment somewhere or something
like this all the anti like or I guess
like environmentalists I would say are
the ones being triggered by this well
did depends depends how you look at it I
mean because you can take you can take
something like that you can shred it and
then you can still recycle the parts
that are shredded up however Apple
saying dispose of them like do not
recycle them even if you have never
recycling is okay but you can't reuse
them okay and you can't repair them two
different times the right to repair is
something that a lot of people
especially in the maker space or in
communities where where you you want to
adopt a mentality not of using something
and then throwing it away and getting a
new one but using something using it as
much as you can and if that thing is
functional for you and works well to
repair that thing that it breaks and
keep using it and use it as long as you
might possibly be able to write it's
kind of like saying there can be no
organ donors yeah and when it comes to
electronic at a perfectly good heart the
mint app yeah the mentality of taking
electronics like like my GH for broke
like the HDMI out doesn't work on oh
well I'm just gonna go buy a gh v you
know like that's that kind of BS right
that people do like yourself that's what
I did last week people great I'm
hypocrite but point is we're going to
argue this right now Apple sucks because
of this so how much more should we hate
them
there's several options here obviously
the people can choose from so feel free
to peruse those I will post in
chat theoretically and since I went
first last time I'm going to go first
this time okay
of course I got a postseason chat first
um how much more should we hate them I'm
going to say I'm going to say option two
I thought I hated Apple as much as I
could hate Apple is that a Beasley Apple
sucks like that's a terrible company the
products they make are you know they're
all shiny and fancy but really
internally they're they're not all that
great I'm sure you know the software
they have software an operating system
and stuff and protect people from FBI
and that kind of thing but who cares
about all that what we really care about
is the ability to reuse the stuff that
we buy the ability to say take an
operating system and install it on a
piece of hardware that wasn't made by a
specific company that's called Apple and
the ability to do what we want with the
stuff that we buy like if I buy a
product I should be able to do whatever
the hell I want with it which includes
repairing it which includes taking
pieces of that product and pizzas of a
different product and combining them
together to make a new product that
works better and it's faster that
sentient that has the ability to think
and become a better living organism than
people are to eventually replace people
and point is I thought I thought I hated
Apple before but now wait is that what I
was arguing for new number two I'm
number two I thought I hated him before
but then I found out about this that I'm
super pissed off now you hate him even
more Apple sucks okay I'm gonna say that
I was already at maximum hate there's no
more hate hate this doesn't surprise me
that Apple would pull some kind of
like this it wouldn't put it past them
in a million years so when this news
came out I was like still hates you the
same I still hates you at a hundred
percent I can't go beyond 100 percent
Paul I can't do it 100 percent is
maximum your dials don't go to eleven I
wish I had a dial that went to eleven
for how much I hate
Apple but unfortunately that dial has
already been set to 11 if only it went
to 12 Dallas don't go to 12 cap no they
don't
um that's that's all I have to say I am
NOT drunk
what are you talking about chat you're
drunk
nonsense okay let's see what people
think about this one
kidding curious curious with results are
I look I won again yeah well it was very
close I was not expecting to win you can
give it a couple minutes but most people
were already right up there like straw
already hit an apple but now maybe a
little bit more yeah now maybe I still
hate Apple I have to agree with and
there was everyone there was 18% that
were tolerant of Apple but now they wish
shell phones would explode in painful
ways that's violent it's very violent of
course you also haven't life threatening
though that's have same as option 3 but
people die did you what I did that was
dark I kind of like that one I tried to
argue I was gonna argue and I was like
no I don't I don't have it any right now
we have seven percent that think it is a
reasonable and profitable business
practice when the economics of scarcity
are considered and they also be all over
public clothes and up clean up
afterwards gross that's disgusting
that's really depressing
all right well we have we've just plowed
through my content for this half of the
show but don't worry don't worry it's
almost dinnertime yeah we are going to
wrap up my half with a bit of answer
questioning question answering I should
say we should question all the answers
and answer all the questions what do we
go yeah I don't know I've I've lost
track of everything okay no wait that's
that's my half
Paul Saif um yeah I need to open the
windows well the $50 was for you it was
Sam you a bomb
nice nice a mom why did it pop up on my
chest her cell might have just taken it
cuz he knew it was on your half but then
moved to my half hobby I'm talking about
it true that's fine Cody for $10 Paul do
you dress to the left or to the right
asking for a friend do I dress to the
left or to the right yeah
like you know I'm right in the middle
I'm right I'm right down the center we
me too I think
right nothing that's that's what I
that's sort of try to go for I think I'm
answering that question correctly but
I'm not yeah
Kota okay crazy bro maverick metals $5
y'all should do a live PC for a giveaway
and also Kyle how is the VR fit
challenge going oh yeah um it's going
really well honestly I think I'm on week
2 right now I've been doing it four
times a week consistently nice it's a
lot of it's a lot of work but it's kind
of cool because I have to like clear out
my office every time I do it so it like
forces me to clean my room
Oh give me a few days so there's no like

question is for Kyle actually how is the
go anywhere PC holding up with the
cutout it's good I honestly haven't used
it too much since for a while now it's
been several months but I am planning to
upgrade it with a new graphics card as
well as a mini ITX a.m. for board once
those are available perhaps one of the
biostar be 350 s that we just talked
about a Baku I think it's it's due for
an upgrade but so far it's been holding
up even with that little modification
that I made cutting out the part of the
crossbar seems to be very rigid
especially when it's all like you know
when the cover is actually screwed down
nice and tight that sort of provides
some extra rigidity so she's saying you
can like fold it in half now like in a
quarter yeah it's actually a feature now
that it crumples that's it's great for
corrects is very very portable that way
