at the msi geforce gtx 780 lightning
edition built to be perfect setting a
very high standard
they are msi but the 780 lightning is
kind of MSI's flagship people have asked
me what the differences between the
Lightning Edition and the more
mainstream Edition of MSI's cards like
the red ones versus the yellow ones for
example and the main difference is going
to be this card is the flagship it's a
very over built they put a ton of like
extra componentry and high-end
componentry and also often with these
types of cards msi will bin the GPUs
that they have from Nvidia they will
test them they'll see which one's
perform the best and they'll put them in
their highest end cards kind of makes
sense but for that reason you'll get
very good overclocks with this card out
of the box and you will often be able to
push this card even further thanks to
the cooler they've done as well as the
custom PCB that they've designed and all
of that good stuff
let me flip over to the back here really
quick so if you guys are interested you
can take a closer look at MSI's
marketing information here
triple force architecture so three
signals three colors on the on the
lightning logo on the side of the card
depending on the load try frozer that's
an upgrade from twin frozer if you're
wondering why it's tri it's because
there's three fans now instead of two
independent control system so you can
independently control the all of the all
the fans individually it's kind of nice
to reduce the temperature of the GP of
the memory and the power modules digital
PWM control as well so a digital power
delivery for the card airflow technology
seven eight millimeter keep pipes
desperate movable technology on the fans
that means they spin in Reverse for 30
seconds when you start up to kick any
dust buildup off of them high-end
components used in the build itself if
you've if you've ever bought like a
flagship card from somebody like msi or
another graphics manufacturer you might
look at the packaging itself you can
tell they spent a few extra bucks on it
so that you can get that feeling of yeah
I just spent a lot of money
look how nice everything is alright so
there's card you get like to lose super
squishy little cell foam and this I love
this phone every time I get this film I
want to keep it and find out something
useful to do with it anyway and then
look at drawer yeah
none of those silly boxes within other
boxes we got a drawer alright now I
mentioned the GPUs are bent to that ends
a lot of people will buy this card
they'll take this cooler than MSI's put
a ton of work into designing when
they'll take it off and they'll pop on a
water block or something like that
no but MSI has anticipated that so
they've given you this extra little
backplate or actually might be a top
plate I'm not even positive but
basically when you remove the default
heat sink fan you put that on that still
gives you some contact points here for
the VRMs for example they've already
provided some some thermal pads on there
so you just peel that off and that way
you can water cool and still have a nice
nice play down there to keep things
sturdy and cooled quality stability for
military classic components outdated
driver disk click user's guide some
other stuff apart from an SLI bridge
which is really long I did want to point
out they do give you some voltage read
connection connectors right there so the
plug that actually goes under the board
and then these point parts which you can
connect to your multimeter for voltage
readings and yeah that's pretty cool and
now the card itself the msi gtx 780
lightning a yellow and black is the
color scheme for this one if you're
interested in a matching motherboard hey
check out MSI's z87 series the empower
macs for example matches this car
beautifully coincidence that msi would
design a motherboard that matches very
nicely with their highest and graphics
card here's a Lightning logo on the side
that will light up we did a quick demo
if you guys want to check out our new
egg TV video on this card I did a
lighting demonstration I am planning on
plugging this in to my system here and
doing some game demos for you guys
hopefully in a few moments here but yeah
if you want to see all the lights in
action you can check that out speaking
of lights for all the power phases right
here they have corresponding LEDs on the
back these will light up
depending on how much loads on the card
so you see a few of them light up when
card is first started up say in 2d mode
and then you'll see a bunch more light
up if you put a heavy load on the card
cool for power you get to eight pin pegs
PCI Express graphical connectors here's
your three independent fan connection
points over there here are those voltage
contact points so for voltage readouts
three of those each one will split off
into two for voltage readings massive
massive aluminum Finneran just tons this
card is very heavy it recommends if
you're installing it in your case just
make sure that some some sometimes cases
love those little supports you can do
for graphics cards it's gonna work
otherwise just whenever I have a card
that's heavy I'm always a little
concerned about possible drooping in the
slot and you know drew pitch you never
want that if you can avoid it but
sometimes it's hard to otherwise but if
you look at the cooler itself this is
gonna take up more than two slots so
you're gonna need at least a single PCI
Express slot in between this card and
another one of these cards if you're
gonna go for a multi card configuration
it's it's capable of up to four weig but
I think you're only gonna be able to see
four-way with this particular card for
people who are actually going to pop off
this cooler and install a custom water
block so yeah you also have the GPU
reactor in the back which as you can see
that for trude's a bit too the reason
that MSI put this right here is to move
the capacitors closer to the GPU that
way when the GPU calls for power it's
right there and doesn't have to shuffle
it all the way across the plane of the
PCB in order to get it there it does
provide a it does make a bit of extra
bulk on the back of the card effort
varying opinions about whether people
are ok with that or not your mileage may
vary but I haven't run into a conflict
with it personally so I can't say that I
particularly dislike it or anything like
that
apart from that's yeah
three gates of gddr5 memory 384-bit bus
all the specs you would expect from a
GTX 780 you got your your DV tool - dual
link DVI HDMI and DisplayPort as well as
some extra ventilation back there for
air to escape and PCI Express gen3
that's handy to have yeah but what I'm
going to do with this next I'm going to
take this back to my personal system
that I have set up which is not a not a
testbed by the way it's just a system I
use it on a daily basis just about for
video editing and gaming and whatnot so
it's not specially customized so I'm
going to pop this in there yeah I'm
gonna play some games for you guys
sounds like fun
so there you go guys
definitely amazingly performance amazing
performance on this card especially if
you're go for higher resolutions like
2560 by 1600 that I was playing at a
very good performer as the 780 is
designed to be and I like the additional
memory again for high resolutions if
you're rockin 2560 by 1440 or 2560 by
1600 or even 4k sometime soon 780 is
actually a great solution for that
amongst the current generation of video
cards but that is all for this video I
really appreciate you guys stopping by
and watching thanks for bearing with me
during my move and my somewhat limited
ability to post videos on my channel of
course you can always catch me over on
the new ik TV channel because I do still
go there on a daily basis and make
videos since that's that's my job
but yeah if you enjoyed this video if
you like watching me play games go ahead
hit the like button I think it's like
down there or something we'll see you
next time on Paul's our great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
