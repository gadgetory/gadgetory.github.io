back to the channel
Nvidia launched a new GPU today it is
the gtx 950 now this is more of a budget
card for 1080 gaming as the pricing
starts at 160 US dollars today we're
going to take a look at a couple
variants the amp edition here from ZOTAC
as well as the asus strix 950 now like
many of the cards that are out there
right now from board partners like EVGA
MSI and gigabyte these cards both come
factory overclocked and they also come
with their own unique cooling solutions
but the GPU at the heart of each card
remains exactly the same so I'm going to
start off with a rundown of the general
GPU specs for the 950 then I will take a
closer look at each of these two cards
and then how about maybe run some
benchmark comparisons to give you guys
an idea of the performance and finally
we'll take a look at some pretty cool
new features that NVIDIA has integrated
into their GeForce experience utility
which allows you to stream your game to
a friend's PC just via a Chrome browser
plug-in and even lets you join in with
them for some co-op gameplay
shall we begin okay so the gtx 950 is a
GM 206 based part that's the smaller
maxwell chip which is the same one the
gtx 960 was based on but with the 950
you get a pared down version with 768
cuda cores versus the 1024 that you get
with the 960 texture units are also down
to 48 vs 64 base clock is a little bit
lower but the boost block is a little
bit higher which is weird I guess but
the memory is a little bit slower to at
6.6 gigahertz as opposed to 7 yoghurts
you get 2 gigabytes of gddr5 on the 950
on a 128 bit bus and although the TDP is
down to 90 watts it still pulls a bit
more power than the 75 Watts it's
available via a PCI Express slot so
you're going to need a 6 pin peg
connector from your power supply to
power the card now for a look at each
card I'm going to start with the zotac
amp exclamation-point
Edition here this is Oh Tech's top-end
950 and you'll notice it's kind of
strikingly similar to their GTX 960 amp
which I reviewed back in January
actually because the 950 and the 960
both use a GM 206 GPU you're going to
find that many vendors have actually
reused their designs from the 960 which
is good if you like coolers that are
over built but bad if you were hoping
for a teeny tiny version of the
50 like what you might have gotten
within 750ti for example anyway though
this card is about two hundred and five
millimeters or 8.0 seven inches long and
ZOTAC Scot you covered with a couple 90
millimeter fans on top pretty decently
sized aluminum thin array with a couple
copper heat pipes underneath and the
metal and plastic shroud has a gunmetal
gray finish with some nice faux
carbon-fiber accents ZOTAC is keeping
the pressure on other vendors by
including their very nice wraparound
metal back plates even on this more
entry-level GPU so good on you so tech
and for vital connection points you have
the aforementioned six pin pegged power
plug the standard PCI Express gen3
connector which remains Gen 2 compatible
if you're upgrading from an older system
a single SLI finger for two-way SLI
support even though I don't really
recommend that configuration on lower
end cards and video outs including a
DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 2.0 and a
couple dual link DVIs note that the
yellow one does have analog connections
as well so you can use a DVI to VGA
adapter on that if you're using an older
VGA only monitor I use this card for the
benchmarks so you're going to see in
just a minute as I got my hands on it
first and it had the higher boost clock
out of these two with a baek's base
frequency of 12:03
a boost of 1405 and a max operating
clock of fourteen sixty seven point
seven out of the box the asus strix gtx
950 very interior also looks quite nice
this is also actually the first asus
strix
out looking card that I've had here in
the studio so I hope to see some more of
them ASIS went with a two fan design
here much like the zotac these are 75
millimeter fans with the distinctive
black and red Strix shroud all around
them this is a plastic shroud which is
to be expected with a lower-end GPU and
the whole card is just under 225
millimeters or 8.8 five inches long
there's an aluminum thinner a down there
and a couple big fat eight millimeter
nickel-plated heat pipes to aid with
dissipation of heat from the GPU no back
plate on this 950 from Asus but there is
a metal support bracket to minimize PCB
flex and that all black PCB doesn't look
too bad if you ask me key connections
are identical to the zotac version with
a 6 pin peg power plug PCI Express gen3
connector single SLI finger and
DisplayPort 1.2 HDMI 2.0 and a couple
dual link DVIs for video outs in
practice the Asus GPU temperature topped
out at 70 degrees Celsius
although the out of the box overclock
was not quite as a
aggressive as the zotac with a base
frequency on the ASIS at 1165 boost of
13 55 and a max operating clock of 1430
point 2 megahertz the zotac ran a little
bit hotter topping out at 73 degrees but
it was running at a higher clock speed
both GPUs won't run their fans at all by
the way until the temperature increases
I think to 60 degrees Celsius so idle
you get 0 noise the coolers on these
cards actually seem pretty evenly
matched from what I can tell and I'm
pretty confident that with some really
basic overclocking you can get
equivalent performance out of either of
these by pushing the GPUs up to the safe
1475 to 1525 max frequency range now I'm
going to move over to some benchmarks so
here's my testbed configuration and
please bear in mind that I'm not tuning
these benchmarks down for these
entry-level cards we're still at very
high or ultra settings where possible
and these GPUs are really going to be
more comfortable at 1080 with high or
medium settings I'm running an Intel 59
30k overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz 16 gigs
of g.skill ripjaws for ddr4 memory at 20
666 an EVGA x99 classified motherboard a
Kingston HyperX savage 250 gig SSD and a
Rosewill tachyon 1,000 watt power supply
all powered by Windows 8.1 64-bit sorry
for the lack of AMD card representation
here but I don't have an r7 370 on hand
which is the nearest competitor to these
two I did throw in the more expensive
gtx 960 and GTX 970 both from EVGA
though in order to give you something to
compare to and that said here are the
benchmarks
okay so the benchmarks tell us that this
card will give you about 80 to 90
percent of the performance of a GTX 960
also that you should stick to 1080
gaming because two gigs of gddr5 is
pretty limited for anything higher and
that you'll probably be more comfortable
tuning the visual settings down a notch
or two if you want smooth 60 plus frames
per second gameplay but wait that's not
all my friends in video was also very
excited to share some new software based
features that they've integrated into
the beta version of their new GeForce
experience utility the first one
provides latency reduction for mobile
players and this will work with the GTX
950 starting in September but should be
also coming to other GeForce GPUs in the
future to the supported MOBA games out
of the gate our dota 2 league of legends
and heroes of the storm and to reduce
input lag time NVIDIA has basically
removed one of the steps from the
DirectX graphics processing pipeline you
can only do this with less graphically
intensive games like MOBAs but when
combined with the GTX 950 s reduced GPU
processing time the result is a
significant reduction in the time
between you doing something like
clicking your mouse and the action
actually taking place on screen they
demoed this with a Frankenstein Mouse
Arduino board to provide a visual cue
for the click and compared it with some
high-speed footage of what happens
on-screen the result is that the action
takes place in about 45 milliseconds
versus 80 milliseconds without this
technology that's a pretty significant
impact for twitchy game genre like MOBAs
finally there's this new in-game sharing
overlay the GeForce experience is
integrated into the most recent beta
which gives you access to the instant
replay feature that automatically DVRs
up to the past 20 minutes of gameplay it
also has the record feature which can
capture up to 4k resolution clips at 60
frames per second and also lets you now
trim down the footage and automatically
upload it straight to YouTube there's
the broadcast feature that can stream
straight to twitch which I'm sure the
xsplit and OBS software devs are super
stoked about and finally there's this
stream button that ties in with game
streams so here's how that works so
first you get the stream button then you
get an email or a URL that you can email
or send the URL to
friend they need to be using Chrome and
also have to install a browser extension
for Chrome but after they do that
GeForce experiences establishes a peer
peer connection and lets you on your
gaming computer stream your game through
to your friends PC via Chrome at 7:20
resolution so they can watch what you're
doing now that's pretty cool by itself
because it eliminates server lag that
you might get via a streaming service
but Nvidia also added the ability to
control the game via the remote system
so you can co-op with a friend and co-op
capable games like trying three even if
they're across the country you can give
control to your friends to help you out
to get past maybe a tough spot in the
game or something like that or if you're
a crazy streamer like my friend Steve
who does his master and minutes show on
Sundays at 7 p.m. Pacific time at
twitch.tv slash burial grounds I imagine
this could be put to good use for
forwarding game streams to other systems
then compile it compiling them into a
master stream or that kind of thing I'm
sure there's lots you can do with it and
I'm excited to see what people actually
get done the remote system doesn't even
need to have an NVIDIA GPU it just needs
Chrome on this system you're streaming
to an i3 2100 or better CPU and a decent
router internet connection with
recommended 7 megabits per second or
better speed okay so that's the nvidia
gtx 950 and let's conclude with some
conclusions so first for those who
really really wanted me to compare this
to the lower end AMD cards that I don't
have my apologies as I do not have those
cards but I will put a link in the
description to a wonderful guru 3d
article which gives a wide array of GPU
comparisons from that I can tell you
that the hundred and fifty dollar r7 370
pretty much gets beat by the nine and
seven err by the 950 in every test that
they ran even though the 370 has four
gigs of VRAM another competitor for the
950 is actually the gtx 960 because when
the 950 starts at hundred sixty dollars
and the Strix one cost 170 and the zotac
one costs 180 at least as of today's
that pricing on Newegg wouldn't you
maybe consider just getting one of the
gtx 960 s it's on sale for like 185 or
190 bucks because they do go on sale for
that much that is something to consider
now the pros list for this GPU is pretty
good though as a low power card i only
pulled about 285 watts max from the
testbed and that's what the 15
30 K you could almost certainly get by
with a 350 water maybe a 400 watt power
supply and the htpc potential is very
nice here since you've got quiet cards
all around hdmi 2.0 support for 4k 60
Hertz plus hardware-based HD DC or h.265
decoding if you're into MOBA games or
indie titles or like world of warcraft
and not as graphically intensive games
and you need an upgrade at this price
range
it's the perfect option in my opinion
also you do get DirectX 12 support for a
little bit of future proofing now the
cons list must mention that you do need
a 6 pin peg connector for this card so
that makes it less of a drop-in upgrade
for folks with older systems with weaker
power supplies that is one of the things
that made the 750ti so successful also
you only get two gigs of gddr5 memory
which was a limiting factor even for
some of the 1080 tests that I ran but if
you are considering going for a 1440 or
a 4k panel any time soon I would want to
beef your GPU than this if you're
thinking of getting one of these though
and upgrading to SLI in the future - I
just I wouldn't recommend it as you'll
still be stuck with 2 gigs of gddr5
effectively
I know DirectX 12 might change that but
until you can actually buy a DirectX 12
game I'm just not going to count that as
a future so there's my review of the gtx
950 and i hope you guys learned a little
bit from it I'm actually pretty excited
about some of the new GeForce experience
features and I think for budget builders
the 950 brings some significant
offerings to the table let me know what
you guys think of this card down in the
comments section though is anyone
actually planning on picking one up also
let me know which version you're going
to get and what kind of system you're
going to put it in whether it's a lower
end gaming system or an HT PC or that
sort of thing
