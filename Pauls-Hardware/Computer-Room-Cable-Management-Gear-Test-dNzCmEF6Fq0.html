SK 630 and SK 650 welcome back guys I
wanted to say thank you to any of you
who watched my video from last week
about actually using Riptide my $10,000
plus PC build because it was very well
received and I'm actually really happy
to be using that computer but today I'm
gonna follow up on something that quite
a few people commented about in that
video which was that the cable
management in my computer room is
abysmal right now in fact I had just
really haven't spent much time on it at
all so that's what today's videos about
cable management's in a computer room I
have two computers I have a few outlets
to deal with and I'm also got sit-stand
desks to work with to have an assortment
of products behind me I'm gonna go over
those and then I'll talk about the pros
and cons of each one
after I've cable manage my computer room
so here in the dining room table I have
an assertive stuff I'm going to be using
today the stuff on the right I'm going
to talk about less we got some plugs
over here and that kind of thing
stuff on the left is the actual cable
management gear and I've been sort of
assembling this actually over the past
years so I've been planning this project
for quite some time so for comparison
first off the classic IKEA Signum this
has been around for quite some time it's
an expensive available at IKEA it's an
under desk rack that you can just pile
your cables in I have a few of those
available I also have this s/t simple
cord cable concealer this is popular
because it gives a very clean sort of
finished look if you want to run it
along your baseboards or something like
that it's also modular has a couple
connective pieces and you can cut it to
size whether you want to go 90-degree in
corners or angle stuff up a wall to get
to an outlet or something like that yes
this one here does not have good
packaging at all several of these were
just bought directly from Amazon so all
they have is a little sticker on them
this is the wire tamer cable management
tray 2-pack from it Jojo we have this
cable management sleeve so it's got like
a zipper on one side and it's kind of
long gather the cables up together
perfect for home or office use I have
kind of a classic set of adhesive based
little cable clips retention clips so
these can kind of cinch up and then they
can release and this right here which is
a hundred pack of these little plastic
brackets you just screw them on and then
it gives you some brackets to connect a
zip tie up to this 3m Scotch indoor
mounting thing which I honestly have no
idea what it is it's been so long since
I ordered it and then I've got some more
traditional just nail based cable
management two pieces here so just an a
little ball with a little hook on it
that holds the cable down and lastly for
direct cable management gear I have this
interesting piece which is also it's the
Jade Channel cable Raceway 48 inch so
long adhesive on the back you attach it
to a wall or it gets the underside of a
desk and then you can just sort of tuck
cables in it that way finally some other
game I'm using today I've got some
little half-inch screws for drilling
into a desk without drilling through the
desk I've got this which is just an
adhesive headphone holder also by Johto
I've got my impact drill and drill and
driver for drilling holes but I'll
probably just use this for drilling in
because I don't want to over drill and
the impact driver is really good at
doing that and then lastly we got a
couple power strips and these are for
under mounting on the desk to provide
power plugs in a more convenient
location as well as some USB charging
ports and I've got a couple versions of
that this kind of smaller one with two
plugs and two ports and then this longer
one by Trond
and both of these I purchased
specifically because they have the
mounting holes on either side so you can
mount them with screws not just as heat
kadhi civ
we stopped by Ace Hardware to
supplements more cable management stuff
mainly I wanted these little slim plugs
the flat ones that plug in and then come
off at an angle because I think they
just look a lot nicer to keep things
cleaner and also prevent like your dog
from bumping up against the plug that's
sticking out and possibly breaking the
wall plate for it we do need to replace
a wall plate because of that so I got
three of these they're all rated for
somewhat different usage I'm hoping to
implement them in different places I got
a black one I got this sort of strange
coloured one here and I got a white one
also we've got some flex to me so this
I'm hopefully going to be using behind
the computers just to sort of tidy up
the cables coming off the back I only
got one small pack of this for now but
I'll see how it looks and how it works
and might add more of that in the future
- and now Hiro is going to take us on a
tour of the computer room it's
oh here it is you guys probably remember
there's Riptide my workstation is right
here my wife's workstation is right here
Joe has added this c-stand light just so
we can have some more light in the room
for this video in particular most of the
time it's actually fairly dark in here
though because I just have a China ball
in the corner and then one more light
right here but here's what we got to
worry about when it comes to cable
management first off switch on the wall
has been taped in the on position for
quite some time it's because I had a
couple outlets in this room that weren't
working so everything was running off of
the switch controlled outlet which is
under this desk I need to wire that
outlet over to the China ball so that we
can use the switch again turn that light
on and off and I've got one outlet down
here
and then one more outlet over here in
the guitar corner and those is what
needs to power everything else in the
room we did recently move these
bookshelves in here which is pretty nice
but my internet is coming through the
ceiling right there and down here and
then there is a switch so that is where
all the internet in the room comes in so
need to wire the internet from that
direction need to wire power from here
and here to power this workstation and
this workstation need to clean my wife's
desk off of course because it's super
dusty ok I can't believe she lives that
way and then of course we've got my
custom-made stand here for our computers
and just want to kind of reconfigure
that a little bit better so that the
cable management looks nice and I'm
hopefully going to tuck as much stuff
down under there as possible because
that was kind of the goal when we built
this so I think that pretty much
explains the goals for this video let's
get to work
yay excellent so here is how I think I
want to attack this I'm gonna treat each
desktop here is sort of an individual
unit and try to get stuff wired up
whether it's power 4 speakers or a
monitor or the desks themselves also
have power try to wire all that over to
a single side so I can have a single
cable going down to that to plug in to
wherever that's gonna plug in this down
there is now plugged in to the lamp
that's up there so I can use the power
switch to turn that on and off again so
before anything else I want to run one
of the cable concealers along here for
that cable and also if you haven't
already been able to tell our walls
haven't seen texturing on them that is
not our choice that was the previous
owners there's not a whole lot we can do
about it right now without some major
work so I just have to deal with it that
means that I can't use these long
adhesive strips that come with the cable
concealer to attach it to the wall
because it's not going to stick with all
that so instead of the adhesive I'm
gonna be using the included screws to
mount these to the wall
it was just laying up a shot
oh here that's so convenient just that's
where you want to lie down yep he's
comfortable
check it out guys
the room is pretty much cable managed I
say pretty much because of course a
project like this is never gonna be
completely finished but the main thing
that I'm missing is some longer
DisplayPort cables I need to go from
here over to this computer and I think
we could have a better situation going
from this done to this computer as well
I'm also looking at this angle and I
could see cables there but you're gonna
have to ignore those for the time being
it's alright don't worry let's move on
so we tried to do a little before and
after shot so you guys could sort of get
an idea of what's been done and what has
changed I am feeling really really good
about everything just because there's so
much fewer cables down here and down
here
already just trying to point out the
things that I'm not completely happy
with right now aside from this thing
right there that's partially there
because my wife needs to be able to
switch to do the KVM here between her
laptop and the desktop but that could be
fixed up a little bit more also down
here we have a single plug sticking out
and that is for the plugs coming over
for the lights I was able to connect up
both lights to the switch so that's
kinda nice but there's a plug that just
had to stick out there just a little bit
it's not a huge deal and in fact I could
plug another light into that if I really
wanted to I guess what I'm happy with is
everything else and I wanted to take
some time now to go over the cable
management products that I used and sort
of give you my feedback the pros and the
cons for each one so first off we have
the st simple cord cable concealer which
I pretty much just used for run right
along the bottom of this wall and part
of that was because continuing that run
behind this wouldn't have done us a
whole lot of good send us it's gonna be
blocked anyway and also moving all this
stuff was gonna be a challenge so we
left it as is I'm happy with the little
run that we got out of it going there
it's gonna keep its you know up against
the wall and I like how clean it looks
with sort of the angled flat plug zone
the wall too and now we have an extra
plug there that we can actually plug
stuff into and use that's convenient on
the plus side this does include adhesive
strips so you can connect it directly to
the wall although I tried to avoid using
adhesive as much as possible in this
project and I really can't use adhesive
on my wall because of all the texturing
which really sucks but we have to deal
with it so I ended up using the include
screws and they do include screws as
well as wall anchors so that's nice it
gets a star for that and it has probably
the cleanest finish of any of the
products that I've used today it is a
little cumbersome to attach the outer
piece here with cables running through
it and I can imagine with multiple
cables that would be even more
challenging and also getting the joints
to line up correctly was a little bit
difficult but overall I think it's a
good product you just got a bear in mind
it's not the easiest to work with also
some of the joints were a little hard to
get attached and it does have to be cut
to length where you want to which maybe
is a pro or oricon for you depending on
how custom you want to do stuff let's
overall I think it's a good product you
just got to bear in mind some of those
caveats the IKEA Signum is next we use
this in a couple places at the back of
both my desk and my wife's desk so these
are an old standby they've been around
for a while the pros are that they do
include screws and mounting hardware and
it will hold a lot of cables or power
bricks so if you have power bricks for
laptops or monitors you can just sort of
tuck them in there and forget about it
you also have a lot of room to work with
so you don't necessarily need to have
all of your cables like completely
wrapped up perfectly however it does
also hang down a bit from the back so
depending on whether or not you want a
super clean finish or not these may or
may not work for you I like them because
they're flexible they're inexpensive
they're easy to put multiple ones on the
same desk but if you're looking for the
cleanest possible thing it's probably
not going to be it next up are these
wire tamer cable management trays I did
end up using one of these it's tucked up
back there at the back right of my desk
from this angle you can actually see all
the cables that are in it's kind of
which isn't the best look but if you're
looking at it from the right it actually
does give you know a relatively clean
finish just because it's got a simple
black finish it is a little on the
flimsy side and it's only got two screw
points to hold it down one on either
side they're kind of angled on the side
so you can still get a screwdriver up
there to mount that so that's relatively
well designed I think this was a decent
product and depending on where you're
placing it of course just wish it was a
little sturdier next are these Johto
cable management sleeves and these are
like a really simple design it's just
neoprene and a zipper and some hemming
honestly which is cool because you know
you can actually expand them so you can
zip up multiple ones of these together
so if you have a lot of cables to tap
together you could do that however I
just found no
used for them here and I think that was
mainly because I ended up using the wire
loom for a run that I had to do that was
kind of like that these could maybe be
used situationally if you really needed
to keep dust off of cables or if you had
a lot of them to wrap up all at once
but I don't think they look the cleanest
when it's actually wrapped so that's why
I didn't end up using them down here I
put the J Channel Raceway the 48 inch
Raceway which I like however I did drill
it to the wall so I used my own screws
to do that it does not come with screws
it just comes with one single long
adhesive strip which might work if you
are actually attaching it to a flat wall
but I don't like relying on adhesive
long term for anything that might have
weight going on it which is why I
drilled it in with a drill bin it's
super sturdy it's really easy to just
tuck the cables in there and you can
pull them out if you need to as well I
was even able to have this ugly thing
popping out like that which like I said
is ugly but I was still able to do so
it's at least functional it's got a
relatively clean look and you could cut
it to length as well if you wanted to so
I think that's a decent product - I
think it was only maybe ten or eleven
dollars this gray plastic cable loom
actually picked up ace hardware so I
didn't include it in the beginning of
the video but I think this is a
fantastic product as well just don't buy
it at Ace Hardware we spent too much
money for a relatively small amount of
it you get this online really cheap so
I'll try to find some there and point it
out it's just really convenient because
if you have a group of cables and you
need to run it across somewhere that's
gonna be visible it wraps them up it
looks much cleaner and because it's
split down the entire way you can unwrap
it and remove or add cables if you need
to that's how I was able to take this
lamp right here run it down there and
plug it into the mid plug that's coming
from that and now I can use our light
switch to turn both lights on and off
Wow amazing technology we had these
adhesive cable clips as well I only
ended up using them back here on the
back of my wife's desk but then I
rerouted the wiring so nothing's
actually connected to it right now these
are decent products again since adhesive
is what holds them on I wouldn't rely on
them if you're gonna be mounting them to
the bottom of a desk for instance
because any time you have adhesive that
has constant weight on it it's going to
give way eventually especially as the
summer continues to heat up so these are
decent I like that you can pop a little
screwdriver in there to unlatch them or
close them just use them situationally
and don't use them for something that's
going to be hanging from
bottom of a desk and finally here is my
winner for today that is these little
black plastic 9 millimeter zip tie
amounts which don't really have much of
a brand name going on but I will link to
them down in the video description so
you guys can check them out they are
only plastic and the negatives is that
they don't come with any mounting
hardware so you need to get your own
screws these are the screws I was using
incase you are interesting in they are
not exactly the right type of screws but
they actually fit perfectly and for just
drilling into wood they did just fine
you're also going to need to bring your
own zip tie or twist tie or velcro strap
in order to feed through there to strap
down whatever you want to strap down but
if you're willing to deal with that you
get a bunch of them there's over a
hundred in here and I use like maybe a
tenth of that and all I had to do was
pair each one up with a screw and then I
was basically able to do a bunch of
custom wiring wherever I wanted so like
I've got one there and another one there
and another one under here and then I
put another one back there and that's
allowing me to just really securely
route all the cables down here get them
really close up to the desk and just
customize and put them wherever I want
to oh did I mention I also installed my
my headphone stand right there
also from Giotto that one's also great
but again screwed it in because I do not
trust the adhesive so these are my
winners as far as the most useful and my
favorites of the cable management gear
that I have been presenting to you guys
today so again I'll link that down in
the description but honestly having a
range of supplies was really helpful for
today because anytime I needed to do
anything specific I was just like oh let
me try this instead but guys that is
gonna wrap it up for this massive cable
management video I'm really happy with
how everything turned out and hopefully
I gave you guys a little bit of feedback
on the various cable management products
that I used today so if you're looking
to do something similar you can choose
the product that suits your needs the
best again links are down in the
description for everything thank you so
much for watching hit the thumbs up
button on your way out and we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
