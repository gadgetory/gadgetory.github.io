description for more information what's
up guys how's it going and welcome back
to Pauls hardware today I'm doing my
monthly builds video for October 2017
and I am super late this month it's like
October 20th right now usually I do this
at the beginning of every month and then
I build one of the systems that I part
out in my builds video later in the
month last month I came through actually
built the mini ITX system that I
promised you guys I would build but for
today if you were coming to this video
expecting me to actually build something
check out my builds playlist because
there are many builds on it some more
recent some a little bit older but all
of the builds that I do in my monthly
build series are based on your feedback
so I have a straw poll linked down in
this video's description about what you
guys want to see for November we had
some requests for a super tower max
overkill build for this month which I'll
get to in just a minute
but I have a few other options on there
for instance a budget core i3 coffee
lake maybe something with the AMD's new
rise in AP I'm not sure if that's
actually going to be out yet or maybe
just a simple $800 gaming PC for October
for this month you guys all voted last
month and the number one request was a
scary computer for Halloween also second
and just just a percentage point behind
or not even this percentage point behind
was a super Tower build a max overkill
PC so what I actually did for this month
was I have a super tower build that's
the scariest computer that I've ever
assembled and we'll get to that in just
a second but I actually have three
builds total this month partially
because one of them is sort of a rehash
of one of last month's build and I will
be putting that one together that is a
thread Ripper entry-level build now when
I say entry-level I don't mean like
entry-level PC I mean entry-level thread
Ripper which is to say if you've decided
that you have a need for a high-end
workstation PC and you've decided that
you want to invest in thread Ripper
which is AMD's high-end
top platform with X 399 motherboards how
much do you need to spend to build the
system that is reasonable surrounding
those parts considering the two CPUs on
this platform cost six hundred to a
thousand dollars and the motherboards
all cost upwards of three hundred then
of course I'll be covering that
super-scary tower building that I put
together and finally a pretty sensible
in my opinion coffee lake build with the
80 600 K recently launched from Intel so
let's get right into it with the
entry-level thread Ripper Redux build
and again I try to go over this one
fairly quickly since this is really
similar to the system that I parted out
last month it costs about eighteen
hundred dollars tool for the parts that
I have listed here and one of the
reasons that I haven't built this yet
and then I'm excited to build it soon is
that I actually have plans for this
build I'm gonna put it together and then
Kyle and I am leading up to the holidays
are going to be doing sort of a
collaborative it's gonna be like an
auction for the system that's gonna all
be donated a charity and we have a live
stream planned again we're gonna be
gaming but the point is I will be
putting the system together and then
we're not exactly sure how we're gonna
do it yet it's either going to be an
auction of the system that gets donated
to charity or we might have people
submit just like a basic dollar amount
like ten dollars per entry and then
we'll draw a winner from that still not
a hundred percent how we're gonna do
that but point is money goes to charity
system goes to somebody who actually
hopefully can use it but all that said
though it's based on the threader for
1900 X which is an eight-course 16 third
processor there is competition here on
the mainstream side from AM B's
mainstream risin platform with am 4 you
can get an 8 core 16 thread risin 7 1800
X or 1700 even that has effectively the
same processing power as this platform
so if you're investing here you're
probably going to upgrade that 1900 X in
the future but we'll come back to that I
have a liquid cooler on here from inter
max that's specifically designed for
thread Ripper and I have the asrock X
399 Taichi motherboard which as shown
last month I actually already have here
ready for the build and I'm gonna be
gathering up the rest of these parts
very soon let's start off with the CPU
though which is of course that 8 1900 X
3.8 gigahertz 8 core processor coming
out a little bit cheaper than the $600
MSRP that AMD initially said I can get
it as cheap as 520
five dollars right now from super biz or
540 directly from Amazon so enter max
has been developing their tech TR for
addition coolers this one was recently
tested specifically by gamers Nexus
Steve and the folks over there did a
great job testing and showed that's when
you have a larger actual cold plate
that's making contact with your threader
per CPU since thunder / cpus have a very
large heat spreader as well as four
distinct separate rise and dies in there
you get better cooling so first off the
air coolers that have been designed
specifically threader first therefore
have been doing a really good job but
water coolers design for thread Ripper
that again have that larger size skull
plate are doing better if they have a
larger cold plate and make better
contact and everything and I'll post a
link to Steve's video in the description
if you want to check that out but I
really saw a cooler it's a hundred and
eighty I'm sorry hundred and thirty
dollars so you can get air cooling like
the Noctua fan versions for about fifty
bucks cheaper than that but liquid
cooling does do a better job as rock X
399 Tai Chi I already mentioned this one
when it comes to thread Ripper
motherboards suck at TR four they're all
pretty expensive this as erotic extra 90
nine tight she has a really wide variety
of features including triple m to you to
802 L 11 AC Wi-Fi and just pretty much
all the basic functions and connectivity
that you would you would want for a
high-end workstation build and it's $340
and still coming in at at least
according to new egg the cheapest
amongst all of the tr4 motherboards that
are out there which range from about 350
up to 550 dollars this one's still about
340 $10 mail in rebate available too so
seems like a solid entry-level thread
Ripper choice memory is horrendously
overpriced right now unfortunately so in
order to get us a quad channel kits 4x4
gigs of 16 gig memory that is at least a
reasonable speed
I just did a parametric filter on PC
part picker which is what I'm using to
choose all the parts for today by the
way going for some faster ddr4 memory
speed 3000 are above
4x4 gig kits g.skill has some options
there about
seventy-five bucks is what you're gonna
spend this one I'm not really caring too
much about color or anything like that I
just want a solid kit of memory to use
its best enough and that's well they're
all overpriced but not quite as
overpriced I did the same parametric
filter solution for the GTX 1070 that's
in this build you can get one for less
than $400 right now so the parametric
filter actually chose the that's a very
tiny picture for a very tiny graphics it
actually chose the GTX 1078 geek mini
from gigabyte which is very small it is
among the cheaper that are available
depending where you buy it but you might
consider something that's a larger size
maybe that a little bit better cooling
like the msi gtx 1070 armor eight gig
that's also available there for about
400 but point being if you want a solid
graphics card that's in the mid-range
that isn't horrendously overpriced 1070
is a good option for that for the case
so with the fractal design mesh if I see
this is partially because I have this
case already it's partially because this
case has really good airflow and since
there are some higher-end components in
here that are going to be generating
some heat especially if you're doing
rendering or that kind of thing you want
good airflow this one has it's and a
solid set of case options besides that
good job by fractal on this one a joy to
build in as well and should fit all
those parts in there nice and snug as
well as having some expandability area
in the future
finally a power supply just went with
the EVGA 750 watt 80 plus gold this is
the GQ version the 750 GQ does have all
black cabling so that's gonna look
pretty clean you're not gonna have any
ketchup and mustard nonsense in there
today plus gold rated it's 750 watt it's
gonna provide you the juice you need for
your build let's move on to the
requested build for this month which was
the spookiest scary build deep the
fearsome bill
full of fear and hatred and to scare you
guys I'll be honest
Kyle already jumped the gun on this one
over on Kyle's assumed to be defunct bit
wit ultra channel which YouTube is
making him cancel Kyle has already
posted not one but two themed Halloween
builds for October which is why I didn't
go directly with with kind of what he
did he has the evil build which is sorry
I'm not subscribed to it with ultra on
the account I'm logged in right now but
it appears to be a build full of cobwebs
and skulls and candles and stuff like
that and then he also has the RGB
pumpkin PC where he built a computer
inside of a pumpkin I saw this when I
was over there for the live show the
other day and it actually turned out
pretty fun so hopefully those will be up
on his main channel soon as well so
people who aren't subscribed to but
ultra can check them out but I decided
to kind of go the other way my scary
build is scary for PC Builders out there
and I also have to point out there is
this there's a major flaw with my
scariest PC build and that it is pretty
much incompatible from the get-go
here's my idea I have this motherboard
it's the asus rog rampage 6 extreme it's
basically one of the most expensive
motherboards on the market right now six
hundred and fifty dollars so my thought
was intel has gotten a lot of flack for
this platform X 299 LGA 2066 and some of
their choices for CPUs they've
implemented their what if I were to make
the scariest skylake X system by
actually using a KB like X CPU and just
making all of the wrong and improper
choices what I have here is a system
that will cost you somewhere in the
range of $3,200 and as long as you can
ignore the key point that my rampage six
extreme super super duper high-end
motherboard is incompatible with KB leak
X processors and honestly Asus thank you
for doing that it's completely
impractical otherwise physically it
would fit I was hoping you could
actually would actually work in this but
Asus is just like no we're not we're not
even going to provide support for that
but if you can look the other way for
that incompatibility here's the rest of
the build we got at the top the i-5 76
for TX one of the most hated processors
of the year it is a quad core processor
it
no hyper-threading it has support for
dual channel memory on a quad channel
memory platform and Intel is still
charging two hundred and twenty dollars
for this but it is LGA twenty it's 2066
it will slot into an LGA 20 66
motherboard just just not this one I've
chosen but we of course need to cool
that CPU so I've decided since we've
invested so much otherwise we should
probably get a nice budget CPU cool in
there so I just sorted by price I did a
parametric filter here and that there
was actually a really horrendous CPU
cooler in here before it was it was very
akin to like yeah I was like one of
these one of those like fake Intel kind
of Intel stock cooler knockoffs that I
thought might have been fun to throw in
there unfortunately the price apparently
has gone up on that so you can get the
deep cool gam X 400 this is like a hyper
212 kind of variants which I bet is
actually a halfway-decent cooler and hey
for $15 like that's a that's a great
deal right there that'll keep our 77 76
470 640 X nice and cool mother bought of
course the rampage 6 extreme 650 freakin
dollars for this thing but it is
absolutely just decked out with with
crazy features and and everything so
it's just sacrilege to even consider
dropping a 70 640 X in here which is why
ASA said no we're not even gonna support
it on for him but but um if you're
willing to overlook that let's move on
to our memory configuration we have a
dual channel memory support with the CPU
but again got to keep that upgrade path
option available so I went with a single
stick of 8 gig memory from Crucial
Ballistix just the ballistics port there
could have gone with a single 4 gig
stick but you know I can only be so
cruel to you guys for our graphics card
we of course have the vaunted Radeon rx
Vegas 64 this is the reference Edition
from power color only priced about and
it's just somewhat reasonable it's only
about seventy to a hundred dollars over
the suggested retail price for these
GPUs right now so figured grab two of
those probably drop them into a
crossfire configuration at least we can
still call it crossfire for now and that
should get you set up for graphics cards
since this is
they high-end build of course we got to
have lots of space for future expansion
not that we can add too much more to
this motherboard since we've only got 16
PCIe lanes from the CPU but with the
cosmos 7 700 P from coolermaster
recently released high-end case that's
only about 300 dollars so it's only
about a hundred actually less than a
hundred dollars more than our our CPU
and then of course never skimp on the
power supply guess so we got the corsair
ax 1500 i 1500 watt power supply here
really really high-end power supply it's
been kind of the gold standard titanium
rated power supply for quite some time
and then you might have noticed that I
didn't get into storage yet and here was
kind of my other funnest part of this of
this particular build was I decided to
go with some next-generation storage and
of course we all know that in cells
obtain memory technology is pretty
amazing when it comes to performance
read and write speeds but mainly
input/output operations per second per
second they're pretty crazy so you can
get them in a 32 gig capacity it's meant
to act as obtain memory and be a like
like a cache for a hard drive but
there's nothing that stops you from just
using these as SSDs so we have plenty of
expandability on our motherboard itself
so I went with four of these that's
right for 32 gig intel obtained memory
modules at only about $80 each gives you
for the low low price of about 320
dollars a 256 gig nvme SSD raid array
but I didn't I didn't I'd have to point
out that you will need a riser card
since there's only three actual MDOT two
slots on this motherboard so I went with
a a ghetto super ghetto green one for
just pcie 3.0 by 4 riser cards so point
being most of the system won't actually
function but you could get a $500 LGA
2066 motherboard that I believe is
compatible with the CPU and then you
could theoretically put all this
together you might need to pay extra
money for Intel's vrock module in order
to put all of your Intel obtain memory
modules into an nvme raid array and boot
off of it so that might be an added
expense although we're still not totally
intel has not been forthcoming with the
prices for the vrock add-on dongles to
enable bootable nvme raider ace so you
might have to just like raid a couple of
these through the chipset and then maybe
wanted to just directly with the
software raid but I'm sure you could get
up and running and I mean you got octane
on there and 256 gigs of SSD support
you're golden alright guys one more
bonus build since my first build was
kind of a rehash and my second build was
kind of impractical let's actually
follow up with the real builds that you
guys I would say um could could build if
you're into Intel now I am NOT going to
address the Intel vs. AMD arguments here
that's not what this video is about but
if you've looked at that and you've
decided that a six core Intel
coffee-like processor is your cup of tea
if probably if you're mainly focused on
gaming then the i5 8600 K can be had for
$280 which is a pretty decent bump up
over the 7600 K but you do get six cores
rather than four so that is nice and it
is unlocked for overclocking so one of
these somewhat reasonable CPUs that you
can buy and coffee like right now
because it's unlocked for overclocking
so it matches up with the motherboards
and everything anyway this total build
is gonna be somewhere between twelve
hundred and twenty three dollars I'll
say twelve I'm gonna say twelve fifty in
the actual description since you know
sometimes I count mail-in rebates and
sometimes I don't
but beyond the CPU you've got a cooler
master master air pro four CPU cooler
available for as little as thirty bucks
right now if you include a rebates solid
air cooler you know gets the job done
kind of in the same tradition of the
hyper 212 family but it's got a nice
black plate over the top that makes it
look quite a bit cleaner from the
visually speaking we need a motherboard
you can get these first cheapest like
120 hundred and thirty dollars was easy
370 chipsets but those are pretty cut
down so the gigabyte z 370 horas ultra
gaming this is a board I've actually had
some hands-on time with and one of my
four this was actually that it has the
USB 3.1 gen2 front panel header on here
and this this board does that seems to
be hard to find actually with these
motherboards so take a close look if
that's something that you're interested
in of course your case needs to have
that
- or check out my video on adding one of
those yourself if you can find the
adapter cable from Lian Li or elsewhere
beyond that you know you you have a
solid feature set you've got to weigh a
GPU support you have your SATA and your
MDOT two connections to MDOT two slots
on this board some decent power delivery
as well as cooling for that power
delivery for overclocking and of course
you got some RGB LEDs cuz everyone's
gonna have those pretty solid feature
set for a hundred and seventy dollars
from gigabytes next up we need memory
this is a 16 gig or 2 by 8 gig kits
which is what I'd recommend for this
particular build you could go with eight
gigs just to get you buy if you really
wanted to save some money
I found this G scale kits new egg
business for about a hundred and fifty
dollars but probably gonna spend between
150 and a hundred and seven one hundred
and seventy dollars for a 16 gig 2 by 8
gig kit right now for storage I've gone
with a parametric filter again and you
should be able to find a 250 or 250 gig
SSD for about $80 right now bear in mind
if you're you're looking by price per
gig which is a good way to sort if
you're on PC part picker and you're
looking up storage $80 again is that
price and and there's a few options down
there it does start to ramp up
relatively quickly once you gets too far
beyond that but I do want to mention if
you're starting by price per gig and you
include not just 250 gig but also the
500 gig SSDs you can't get a little bit
better price per gig options there 525
500 gig versions for 140 250 dollars
available there but of course then
you're spending a decent amount more
money 250 gigs you should be able to get
by with and won't have too much issue
and you can of course always add storage
in the future and now for a graphics
card once again GTX 970 it is the more
reasonably priced option when it comes
to high to mid mid to high range
graphics cards and you can get this one
for as little as 380 follow up the stuff
I said earlier in the video about other
gtx 1070 options for a case just went
with thin NZXT s340 in black because it
is a very solid all-around case with
good airflow and looks and you can get
it for about $65 of course there's lots
of cases in this price range so if you
like one that looks looks different then
then do that too finally Paris fly EVGA
650 watt this is again the 650 GQ the
baby brother to the 750 GQ that I talked
about in the other build and yeah only
about 70 tuition dollars and also some
Mellon rebates available there as well
so as you can see you can part out a PC
right now without going too far over
budget although there are still some
ongoing issues as mentioned in my video
that I posted earlier this week with GPU
prices in particular on the AMD side a
is hurting the most and then of course
those memory prices are really putting
the screws to anyone who is trying to
build a budget system right now but if
you want to build
don't let that set you back when you're
talking about say a $1200 ish build and
you're talking about spending you know
60 more dollars on a memory kit it's not
that much but it is something you should
take a close look at and make sure that
you're getting the best price that you
can right now and make sure that you're
not buying memory that's like really
really low speed because you do get a
little bit of extra boost from getting
memory that's in the say 2800 3000 maybe
thirty two hundred range when it comes
to ddr4 memory speeds but guys that is
gonna wrap it up for this video I hope
you have enjoyed it of course actual
builds via the builds playlist in the
description down below I'm gonna be
building that's that x99 system very
soon and I've got lots of other videos
plans coming down the pipeline to arctic
panther is almost done and that's
actually I'm going to be working on next
right after I finish this thank you guys
so much for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button of course if you
enjoyed it and we'll see you guys next
time
