hardware arrives and I look at it and
I'm like why didn't I think of that why
didn't somebody else think of that they
should have done this a long time ago
and case in point Coolermaster has a new
SF series of fans which are square fans
that's a little bit less innovative what
I think was sort of unique and yeah kind
of gave me the feeling of like why
wasn't this done before they've done a
dual fan version and a triple fan
version so most computers have at least
a few fans to move air through the
system to keep things cool that's their
primary function they also serve to
introduce dust into the system and as is
often the case now since all in one
liquid coolers have become more popular
to cool down the radiators that have
liquid flowing through them most
radiators are gonna have at least two
sometimes three fans sometimes as little
as one but for those that use two fans
or three fans if you've ever gone
through the installation procedure you
know that it can just be a little bit
complicated especially getting them all
in position wearing them all up properly
and now that RGB is pretty much
everywhere you now have possibly a
second set of cables not just connecting
up the power so that the fans spin but
also RGB and sometimes you might have
addressable RGB that is even a little
bit more complicated so to simplify
things for the installation procedure as
well as connecting up those precious RGB
LEDs we have this solution and the SF
240p and the SF 360 are now there's you
might notice that the P options are here
on my right and the our options are on
the left that's simply because there's a
different set up for the addressable RGB
LEDs these fans over here have eight
LEDs per fan and then these on the
rights have 24 individual addressable
LEDs per fan if you're looking at a
single hundred twenty millimeter version
and then this fatty SF 240p actually has
56 because they added individual
addressable RGB LEDs around the edge to
which I think might look pretty cool but
let's get these out of these box take a
closer look so the actual functional
part of all of these products would be
the fans at the center and the fans at
the center are pretty much all the same
with some slight variance in fan speed
and static pressure as far as the box
ratings go at least these are all rifle
bearing fans and they're all rated at h2
30 DBA when it comes to the noise level
they're all four pin PWM controllable
fans as indicated by their plug as well
as of course the packaging and it looks
like Coolermaster
sticking to 120 millimeter size for this
product lineup at least for now
rotational speeds are 650 to 2,400 RPMs
for the P series over here and then it
drops to 2,000 rpms on the SF 120 R and
then down to 1,800 rpm for the triple
fan version here although the fact that
you have more fans is going to overall
produce more airflow the SF 360 are
beyond that the fan blades themselves
according to Coolermaster are designed
with inspiration from helicopters and
jet planes although I think they're just
saying that so it sounds more badass and
then outside of those fan blades is of
course the fan housing and the SF series
that all of these are part of are part
of this trend to go back to a more
square style fan housing which honestly
they they used to do a lot more and then
they feel like a lot of fan
manufacturers started to get fancy with
the housing around here and make it like
look different but honestly especially
if you're putting this up against the
radiator or as a intake in your case or
anything you want as little space or
gaps for air to get through apart from
where the fan is actually pulling the
air through as possible and the square
design is supposed to line up with
radiators line up with van intakes on
the case or exhausts so you get the most
air flowing through the air flow apart
versus leaking out elsewhere another
design consideration for all these fans
is that they have put rubberized pads on
all the contact points front and back so
that is nice as well that's not the most
crazy innovative feature or anything a
lot of fans have been doing that for a
while but it is good to have that
especially for a reduction of vibration
and again especially if you have this
fan or fan assembly mounted up against a
radiator then the last thing I was
looking for when it comes to accessories
is the ability to chain the fans
together according to cooler master and
that is actually only on these 120
millimeter versions which I guess makes
a little bit more sense because you're
more likely to want to chain them
together basically all this means is
that if you have an addressable RGB
header or extension coming from your
motherboard the little three pin kind
you can plug it in right there and it's
got a little extra one coming off right
there so you could daisy chain more
addressable RGB LEDs to that so that is
convenience especially if you're
connecting up multiple fans and you're
not going for the integrated triple or
dual fan combo other than that 120
millimeter fans come up with mounting
screws these bigger ones come with
mounting screws as well as this little
plan
stick piece which is actually made to go
over your addressable RGB LED headers
you connect them up pop them into that
and then that keeps them from pulling
loose I actually think that's pretty
useful I have taken addressable RGB LED
headers and cases and taped them
together simply because there's nothing
to really hold them and they can pop
loose easily that's this is just a nice
little piece makes a little bit more
professional also be a little bit more
clean if you had to do a connection like
this somewhere where it was visible
finally the 360 millimeter version here
the SF 360 far does come with an
addressable RGB LED controller just
plugs in via a SATA power connector and
then gives you the addressable RGB LED
header for that so if you don't have the
capability from your motherboard to
connect that in you can use this it's
just got a single button so you can
cycle through some basic lighting
profiles so we spent some time doing
some basic setup with these fan arrays
fan grids whatever you want to call them
just to give you guys a little bit
better idea of how they work in
everything first thing I wanted to point
out here is that there is actually a
difference between the SF 120 our fans
just fan blades themselves or the
different style than all the other fans
that I mentioned and I only want to
bring that up because I said at the
beginning that all the fans themselves
are the same there is some slight
variation there just so we could fire up
the fans and the RGB LEDs I have
connected up this Zalman zmm FC 3 multi
fan controller which does have a PWM out
so you can control the RPMs with it and
then I'm using this little RGB LED
controller which is compatible with
addressable RGB LEDs and that actually
came with this cooler master 240
all-in-one liquid cooler I do want to
point out that when it comes to the RGB
LED controller that ships with the
triple fan version of the 360 are up
here
it is a simpler controller and this
actually will only support up to it
seems 24 addressable RGB LEDs and I've
discovered that because I connected it
up to the 240p here which has 56
addressable RGB LEDs and only about half
of them lit up I was worried that the
unit itself was defective but then I
just switched to a different controller
and all of the LEDs started so just keep
that in mind if you do get the 360
version of this you're not going to be
able to use that controller to
daisy-chain
additional RGB LED devices from it so
just want to keep that in mind to give
you guys a little bit better idea of how
this will look when actually connected
up to radiator I connected it to
radiator
the Coolermaster ml 240 our RGB and I've
connected up the SF 240p a RGB dual fan
to it just so you can see it does line
up I do want to point out that when it
comes to radiators there is some
variance when it comes to the actual
mounting holes from them there
especially can be some difference in the
gap between the holes for the two
different fans and these fans do
actually have slightly elongated holes
for mounting there so that should
provide a little bit more compatibility
depending on what type of radiator
you're connecting it up - I think this
configuration might be particularly
appealing to people who are really into
the RGB LED thing because it gives you
this nice long light bar that's going to
point sideways out of your case so if
you have a case with a nice big clear
window you should be able to see that
and it should be pretty visible and of
course you can switch around between the
different color cycles and color
patterns I'm just using the controller
that I have here which has a limited
number but if you directly connect it
has compatibility for like a CS or a
sync as well as MSI gigabyte and as
rock's software for controlling RGB LEDs
so you might have more options available
there over in this system here which
we're in the process of disassembling
but it does still have the almond the KU
cooler installed which is a cooler
master 360 millimeter AO which is being
used to cool in 9900 okay we were able
to quickly see that there is a definite
plus when it comes to ease of
installation because the three fans that
were on there we all had to remove
individually and then each fan had two
cables that were wired up to the back
after getting all three removed it was
just a matter of holding that entire
unit up there together so like just a
couple screws to kind of hold it in
place and we're able to go and mount the
rest of them and then again just two
cables to pass through to the back to
connect up for the power for the fans
and the addressable RGB LEDs so that I
think is the biggest selling point of
these sort of combo units here and one
of the things we're like of course if
that's what you're planning to use it
for it makes perfect sense to buy this
type of fan configuration because you
know it's going to be self-contained and
if you're dealing with sort of a
nightmare cable management scenario it
really does simplify connecting up all
the fans and all the LEDs and getting
them to work now the thing that I need
to point out I can't leave this video
without mentioning to you guys is that
both of these units were exhibiting some
electrical noise sort of a high-pitched
whining noise I think had to do with the
PWM frequency depending on the RPMs we
were running them at
we have the fans turned up most of the
way that seems to fade away but when the
fans are running at medium and low speed
there was a definite noise that I was
hearing
and it was the same on both units so I'm
going to contact coolermaster about that
and let them know I'll wait to hear back
from them and then update in the comment
section down below if that's anything to
say about that often times early samples
can have problems like this but then
they fix that for the retail run but
I'll hopefully confirm that and let you
guys know that potential manufacturing
defect decide what are the sort of pros
and cons to going with the configuration
like this as opposed to buying your own
individual hundred and twenty millimeter
fans the pros of course are going to be
that ease of installation and then for a
configuration like this I'd say a visual
look that you can't really get going
with normal fans you can't have a
uniform LED display like this I have
seen ad on LED devices that you can do
sort of something similar to this but I
would say this is unique at least in my
experience the negatives are going to be
first off that if you have any errors
with any of the fans like I'd say
especially in the triple fan unit if one
of those fans goes bad or starts to
develop a rattle or a hum or something
like that you're probably gonna need to
replace the entire unit and that may or
may not be a matter of great
inconvenience for you and then of course
you have the fact that you're going to
be locked into sort of a larger or
medium sized form factor if you're going
with a 240 or 360 version of this if you
for example swapped out your AIO in the
future to a 240 millimeter version or if
you went with a large elect 280 for
example you would either have to have a
weird overlapping situation where your
triple fan sticks out longer than your
radiator or you just wouldn't be able to
use it anymore because it doesn't fit
the new size radiator that you're
changing to so to kind of sum up if my
question at the beginning of this video
was why hasn't anyone really done this
before I would say kind of the pros and
cons outweigh each other if you're not
dealing with addressable RGB LEDs just
having to connect up three fans and
install and mount three fans really
isn't that big of a deal but when you
add in the cabling that's required for
connecting at multiple addressable RGB
LEDs and the fact that these are all
just automatically going to be in
sequence with each other I think that
adds some value and some convenience
that makes these a lot more practical in
today's market than they maybe were
three or four years ago before RGB was
everywhere
one other potential positive for the
multi fan units is price or the
possibility that you're buying in bulk
so maybe you're getting a better price
per fan of course that's somewhat
subject
based on the prices that were listed the
Coolermaster 120-millimeter argb
SF series fan is 35 bucks by itself
which is pretty steep for a single fan
but you could get two of them in the
master fan SF 240p that I've been
showing you for a mere fifty five
dollars at least according to the
current prices on Amazon so that is a
savings of fifteen dollars if you were
to buy two of the $35 fans for $70 or
one dual unit for 55 similarly the SF
120 our fans are 25 bucks each which
again is a little on the steep side for
a fan but you know their Pro Series fans
and they've got RGB and everything but
three of those of course would then cost
you $75 or the triple fan version
another savings here of I guess about 11
or 12 bucks because it's currently 63
dollars and 45 cents on Amazon so that
may or may not be a selling point for
you
so if you guys are interested I'll post
some links to these SF series fans down
in the video description below thank you
so much for watching this video and let
me know what you think of these fans
especially the 2 &amp;amp; 3 fan units of them
are you interested assuming they fix
that electrical noise whiny issue and if
so let me know why and if not let me
know why not as well thanks again for
watching this video guys hit the
thumbs-up button on your way out and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
