fractal design Integra M series of power
supplies semi modular 80 plus bronze
rated and just 140 millimeters long
check the link in the description for
more information
excellent 2014 was supposed to be the
year the 4k went mainstream so let's see
a show of hands who out there has a 4k
monitor or TV ok so I see you that's
kind of what I thought so for most of
you who did not raise your hand
particularly if pricing has been a 4k
deterrent I present the new monoprice 4k
60 Hertz 28 inch monitor aka product
number 1 to 156 link is in the
description below placed tantalizingly
close to the like button when
considering a monitor there are several
elements that are important but to me
the most important one is the panel
itself which will be staring at
constantly let's start there this is
essentially the exact same Samsung
manufactured 28 inch TN panel that you
would find in the Samsung UD 590 and
provides an incredibly sharp 3840 by
2160 ultra HD image this is an 8 bit per
pixel panel which does improve color
depth despite of being TN color
reproduction is boosted to 1.0 7 billion
colors which is more in line with a 10
bit panel Samsung has used frame rate
control to simulate more colors which is
okay with me just don't confuse this for
like an IPS or an IC GL panel that was
made for content creation contrast ratio
is also adequate but not spectacular at
1001 while I love me some good color
reproduction this is a budget 4k monitor
so I wasn't expecting it to cover the
whole srgb color gamut it's really
better suited for gaming and media
playback day-to-day computing that sort
of thing on the plus side TN panels are
very fast
hence this panels one millisecond gray
to gray response time and viewing angles
top out at 170 degrees let's move on to
all the stuff around the panel starting
with the glossy finish directly in front
of it probably see it right now I'm not
a fan to be honest but that's just me I
know there's people out there who swear
by glossy monitors I just happen to
prefer matte monoprice if you're
listening please make a matte finish
version of this monitor it would be
honest
there's about a five eighths of an inch
black bezel surrounding the outer edge
and at the bottom there's a bit of
fanciness in the black brushed aluminum
strip with the centered monoprice logo
as well as the power on standby LED
that's on the left this LED is yellow
for standby and blue for power on it's
not overly bright or distracting so
that's a good thing I love this monitor
stand because it focuses on function
first and it blows the UT 590 stand out
of the water even more so because it
uses a 100 by 100 base amount that's a
standard so you could even remove it for
wall mounting if you wanted the UT 590
on the other hand committed the cardinal
sin for me for monitor stands by having
a crappy one first of all with only tilt
control and not having a base amount so
you couldn't do anything about the
crappy monitor stand the mono price
stand has all four adjustment functions
height tilts about two hundred and
eighty degrees of swivel and even
glorious pivot for portrait mode for
controls we have buttons Thank You
monoprice for putting actual buttons not
annoying touch pads or even the silly
control knob on the UD 590 which works
but still makes things like changing
your input unnecessarily time-consuming
here we can quickly jump to the input
select screen adjust audio color
language and on-screen display settings
in the full menu or turn on the picture
in picture or picture by picture modes
to multi-task I used it to configure a
BIOS on one system while setting up
benchmark runs on the other but that's
just me you could plug an Xbox in or
something like that for video inputs
there's two DisplayPort 1.2 connectors
which are the only ones you should use
if you want 4k at 60 Hertz there are
also a couple HDMI 1.4 a's that also
have MHL functionality if you're into
that sort of thing they can do 4 K at 30
Hertz and finally you get a dual link
DVI that can do 2560 by 1600 which I
thought was nice to include even though
it can't push 4k finally there's a line
in for the 2 2 watt speakers and of
course AC power input the accessory
bundle includes the standard screws AC
power adapter 8 inch audio cable and a
dual link DVI cable at first I was like
oh that kind of sucks where on earth
might I find a reasonably priced
DisplayPort cable for my 4k resolution
oh yeah monoprice anyway I'm told that
starting in about a month they're
actually be including a display port
cable in the box
for now be sure to add one to your cart
if needed mana price has them for very
cheap so now for a conclusion and let's
get the cons out of the way first there
are some natural drawbacks to a TN pedal
so color depth and viewing angle are not
this monitor strong points again not a
huge deal for gaming but content
creators might want to look elsewhere
I already noted my personal distaste for
the glossy finish but maybe for some of
you that's a pro rather than a con also
some cable management built into the
stand would have really made it perfect
but that's really a minor quibble one
last thing to mention is that a 28-inch
3840 by 2160 display will result in some
teeny tiny icons and text when you first
get it set up but I found that sitting
close to the monitor which is fine due
to the high resolution and adjusting
your UI scale and your operating system
is a pretty easy fix for that my pros
list is short but these are the key
factors for buying a new monitor so the
panel is crisp clear and beautiful the
monitor supports 4k natively at 60 Hertz
via DisplayPort and the stand does
everything that a stand should do all
that and it's still cheaper than a UD
590 and we're approaching the holiday
season so maybe we'll see pricing come
down even further and be super sweet so
I would love to hear what you guys think
of this monitor and if monitors like
this are moving you slowly closer to
taking that 4k plunge thank you so much
for watching this video everyone don't
forget to like and share because it
helps me out a ton we'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
