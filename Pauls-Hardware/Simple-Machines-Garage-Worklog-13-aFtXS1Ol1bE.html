garage worklog these are kind of spotty
production value videos that I do to
show you my progress in my garage slash
studio which I've kind of all built from
scratch I am not by any means an expert
when it comes to construction or
carpentry or anything like that but I
like DIY stuff so with that being the
theme I have two projects I'm gonna try
to get done today
one is gonna be mounting a lights from
the ceiling
via a pulley system that should be kind
of fun the other one is a pretty simple
solution for actually mounting some
little ball head to camera mounts around
my set so I can easily connect cameras
to those rather than having to use this
solution like I'm using up here which is
a clamp with a $2,000 camera set to it
that that's perfectly sturdy and
adequate and nothing can go wrong there
anyway but before I get onto that stuff
there are a couple projects I'm working
on that I was going to post this weekend
they're not quite done though so I spent
most of the weekend benchmarking this
system right here or at least the past
few days this is the $3,500 system and
it is absolutely a beast it's really
really fast I have some benchmarks to
share for that and all that good stuff
it's looking pretty pretty - pretty
pretty yeah
although the RGB lighting isn't quite
what I had hoped it would be at least as
far as controlling it anyway of course
more on that video when it comes out I
also have this kid of memory over here
from a vex ear although it doesn't look
that great in this light right now but
who cares it is fancy though cuz it's
got the plasma and the tubes at the top
and I am kind of stoked on this memory
because I think it matches pretty nicely
with this motherboard that I use on my
test bed what do you guys think
so my ongoing goal for out here in the
work area has been to get stuff up off
the ground why well that's where the
dogs like to hang out like here was
demonstrating right now the dogs hang
out down there and every once in a while
you know they hear something and they go
tearing out this has happened in several
of my videos as well as some live
streams they go running across right
here so I try to like keep stuff like
all this nonsense off the floor if I can
and give them a clear path to run if
that happens to be something that they
want to do the other reason is just for
cleaning purposes it always gets messy
out here there's a lot of mess over
there in the corner we're not going to
look at that
but for that purpose I want to get the
lights up off the floor
and I also want to provide myself with
means of recording from up above because
I like the top-down look for that reason
I of course built this entire structure
up here with you know I got my control
panel with switches so I can just turn
the lights on and off
stand on my tiptoes but you know it
makes things easier to turn lights on
now there is lights and then of course
the overhead camera stuff because you
know top down is a great view for doing
live streams or just recording stuff so
I like to record down to what's going on
on this table but I want something a
little bit more permanent that I can
just slap on there and slap off of there
rather than of course this
aforementioned clamp solution so I
recently picked up a new ball head I got
this one obviously because it's fancier
than the others anyway this was a on
Amazon link is in the description if you
guys want to check out it's pretty
heavy-duty and I think it was only like
eight bucks or something like that hope
I'm not wrong about that might have been
fifteen bucks
however much it was link is in the
description so that you can mount with a
3/8 inch screw which is a standard screw
size if you deal with photography in
photography you actually typically have
the quarter-inch thread which is
represented by the top half of this
thing that's a quarter-inch and then you
also have yeah you also have 3/8 inch
threading which is the thicker part
there at the bottom now you can buy
camera gear that has this type of
threading on it and stuff and it tends
to be very expensive and I've gotten a
few of those but I found that by just
heading over to my local Ace Hardware I
was able to get some of these carriage
bolts named so because they're used to
construct carriages originally that's
probably not true but those will thread
right into there it's a standard
threading so that's cool I've already
tested it out and much less expensive
than buying the actual stuff that's like
made for camera works so I'm basically
going to punch these through some two by
fours and then mount to this on the
other side of it and then I'll might use
some washers I got some hex nuts on
there to hold everything in place the
other project the one that's a little
bit more fancy is going to be using
simple machines like pulleys I'm
actually using lots of simple machines I
got simple machines in the pulleys
here tada I have simple machines in I
think this counts as a lever that might
not count as a lever does that count as
a lever anyway it's a hinge I'm gonna
call this a lever even though it's
probably not a lever that's another
simple machine though even my screws
over here simple machines because so you
going around the outside there that's an
inclined plane haha guys didn't think it
was gonna be like a physics basic
physics class here anything moving on
though got some rope to tie everything
up and pass through the pulleys I got
some pleats as well as some rope loops
so I can throw up loop the Rope where I
need to loop the rope that's probably
enough exposition there's all my
hardware let's get to work
so that went really well
actually not only did I blind guess
where the stud was and hit it up there
that was awesome but it's like hanging
down perfectly right here as far as
where it should be to hit me when I'm
talking to the camera over there and
everything it's just kind of sway and
loosely right now but you know it
settles down true right about where it
should I also have I can still undo this
last period so I can move it up and down
to give it a little bit of repositioning
if I need to and now I just gotta set up
the pulley system got my pulley mounted
like so it took me a couple tries to
find the stud this time and now the roof
it's a pulley I got the AC on now sorry
about the noise but I think this project
is looking pretty much complete it's
mounted to the ceiling hanging down
right there hinge at the top rope goes
up to the pulley over to loop right
there and then down to my cleat I think
I'm gonna name my cleat
cleetus Holly's name your cleat Cletus
is a good name yeah so I can just undo
this little guy here so now with the
rope going up to deploy oh you go sneaky
sneaky pull it all the way up hold on
hold on I can't do this while I'm
filming and now late is tucked away up
at the ceiling hey that's actually
really like turned out I was gonna make
it fancier with like two attachment
points at the ceiling and stuff but I
think it's totally good for now alright
let's move on to job number two
okay there it is 3/8 inch bolts going
through to the ball head I can still get
in here to turn it twist this to loosen
the ball head although I'm kind of
worrying cameras all right so that
allows me to move the camera around and
position it however I need it and then
of course I would probably be using two
hands and I can tighten it down in
whatever position I want awesome this
one I kind of tried to get fancy with
and basically instead of getting those
carriage bolts I should have gotten hex
bolts that would have been a better idea
because right now this is pretty much
seized up on either side I tried to
mount this little guide to it which
allows you to basically shift it back
and forth that's actually meant for
focusing but I realized that had it so I
was like I'll let me mount it up here
but now it's seized up and it's just
spinning on there so I can still use it
right now I just have to keep it
centered here so it won't spin but um
yeah that was kind of a fail I got to
figure out how to get that off the day
anyone has any ideas let me know in the
comments alright guys that wraps it up
for this garage work log if you happen
to be one of the few out there who
prefers my garage work logs to my
regular videos I know there's a few of
you definitely hit the thumbs-up button
and let me know that you enjoyed it
leave me a comment in the comment
section down below or if you just happen
to like this video you don't have to
like it better than my other ones anyway
point being leave me feedback and also
click links in the description I put
links to some of the stuff I used today
thanks for watching as always of course
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
