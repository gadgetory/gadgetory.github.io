me a big box of stuff and I'm often like
hey guys that's a lot of stuff and I
appreciate it but it's it's too much
it's too much stuff and then sometimes I
go to CES right after they send me this
stuff and I talked to them there and
then they remind me remember that stuff
we sent you in that nice note and I'm
like okay let me do an unboxing of all
of it so that's what this video is all
about a straightforward G skills new
Trident sea royal series ddr4 RGB memory
kits are made for high class pcs with
each meticulously crafted module
featuring a full-length crystalline
light bar atop a polished heat spreader
with a luxuriant reflective gold or
silver finish reminding you to
appreciate the finer things in life like
the freedom to choose from tried NZ
royal RGB kits in 16 gig 228 gig
capacities and up to ddr4 40 600
megahertz memory speeds if you're
looking to give your high class system
built the royal treatment
click the sponsor link in the
description below so to clarify a bit
cooler master makes a ton of really nice
accessories I don't always have the
chance to look at all of them
individually so this is gonna be my best
attempt to sort of give you guys an
unboxing and a look in each one of these
we have some new SK series keyboards
down here that I think some guys might
be interested because they're very small
and portable we have an RGB mouse mat
which you may love or hate depending on
whether or not you like RGB I've got an
mm 830 mouse and we have some new
keyboards I'm gonna do an unboxing a
quick look at each one of these and you
guys let me know at the end of the video
what you thought order of operations is
gonna be the mouse Matt the mouse and
then all the keyboards so follow the
stack here if you're interested this is
the MP 860 dual sided gaming mouse pad
with RGB illumination it's a dual
surface mousepad speed surface and
control surface and of course our GB
illumination means you're probably going
to be plugging this into your computer
so you got the cooler master logo there
with a bit of RGB around the logo edge
and then the edge of the actual mouse
mat itself glows nice and RGB and flip
it over if you want the smooth side or
flip it over if you want the more
texture inside our next victim is the mm
830 24,000 max dpi hidden d-pad buttons
so you gotta you gotta hunt them down
and find him yourself for Zone RGB and a
precision wheel pbd chassis to minimize
wear and tear along with Omron switches
and Japanese Alps scroll encoder for Jam
free durability
this mouse is a little on the larger
size I would say if you're a palm
gripper it's a fills up your hand a lot
here on the side we can see the hidden
d-pad so up down left and right via a
d-pad on the side
dpi switch here at the center here
scroll scroll wheel feels pretty nice
and again a fairly lengthy braided cable
and there's the mouse plugged in as you
can see four zones of lighting we are
told so I believe one is a scroll wheel
one is a dpi when is the cooler master
logo there and then one is the sort of
edge lighting along the back there and
then it's got a little black and white
LED screen there on the side as well
I'll be honest that seems like a
location where if you're using it you
have to look at it it was big oh what's
it say uh coolermaster make it yours I
do like a little thumb rest there though
that's nice and it is kind of textured
kind of has some rubberized texture on
it then of course you can pair this up
with RGB mouse pad and you have RGB and
it's close proximity to your hand as you
possibly could while gaming she was
obviously going to improve your gameplay
that's the mm 830 mouse and the MP 860
RGB mouse pad and in case you're
wondering the LED display is supposed to
be able to show your stats while you're
playing the game I imagine you need the
software to tie into that that goes a
bit beyond the quick unboxing i'm doing
for today's video so we'll come back to
it moving over to the keyboards we got
the sk series
what does sk mean i can't verify this
for sure but process of deduction SK
maybe means slim keys or slim key caps
because these both use the new Cherry MX
slim mechanical key switches which are
slim they're very small so with both the
SK 630 here and the SK 650 you're
getting a very portable keyboard
thanks to those Cherry MX low profile
RGB switches these happen to use the red
version of those and you have SK 630
which is 10 keyless so very small and
portable then you've got the SK 650
which is full size and it's not that
combination sort of mid-range one here
you get a full keypad here as well as
all your directional buttons and home
insert delete so in the box with each
keyboard you're gonna get a little key
cat puller that's always very convenient
to have when it comes to mechanical key
switches and you also gets a braided oh
my gosh
USB type-c cable look at that that's
gorgeous it's beautiful even comes with
the velcro strap to wrap up the cable
when you're not using it they have a
lovely plush
keyboard carrying holder here so you
know take it on the go
so I think what people are gonna most
like about these is just their really
clean very clean very simple design so
brushed aluminum across the top and
comes to the base above the keys the
keys a little profile so you know it's
not like the slimmest keyboard I've ever
seen definitely shorter travel time than
standard Cherokees and then you'll also
notice that there's no spacing
indentation or anything here you have a
really flat typing surface that's purely
a matter of preference some people like
having the concave keys and the rows
that are kind of staggered down as you
get further to the bottom some people
like this really flat level surface but
you still have your home keys with some
notches on them they're USB type-c plug
is right here in the dead center so plug
them like so and then we have the keys
that light up as well you'll notice
there are some function keys across the
top here these are accessed with the
coolermaster button here which functions
as your function button that will allow
you to do stuff like controlling the RGB
lighting Coolermaster actually that's a
really good job with allowing you to
control the RGB lighting on keyboards
without needing software but according
to the box there is software that you
can also use to control this if you so
desire but up here for function buttons
we have some LED controls and then on
the top right we have some media
controls so stop play pause forward back
and then further function controls at
the top and bottom here also for
controlling LEDs I've got a both plugged
in now so you can see they're just
lighting up in a default purple let me
see if I can remember how the function
keys work to change that color master
has a tutorial on how to do all this
stuff I am just sort of mashing Keys
trying to remember exactly what I should
remember but you can you can punch these
buttons here so like red green and blue
and that will allow you to add like
eight levels of red and then it resets
green the same way and then it'll reset
blue the same way and it resets so now
we have no red green or blue and then
you can add your red C so now we have
all red and then I want to mix red and
blue make purple again we can add our
blue and make a different level of that
now we have some purple again add all
three colors and you get white yeah
that's kind of wait so guys I know this
is just a quick unboxing but initial
impression it's pretty positive here
these have a real nice feel they're not
too terribly heavy as well if you're
gonna take them on the go and again I
just I think it comes back to just that
really simple clean design brushed
aluminum across the top just a very
slight bevel around the edge here and
then the bottom just
keeping it pretty straightforward and
simple so that is the SK 630 and SK 650
keyboards now featuring the new tre MX
low-profile red switches
next is the CK 530 this is a full
mechanical switch keyboard this one's
using blue switches you can tell they're
a little clicky down there this one's
gonna give you a reasonably priced
mechanical keyboard option it still has
an aluminum top plate and everything I
wasn't able to find pricing for this
right now but there's a CK 550 version
of this - that's a full-size one and
they should be very reasonably priced
sorry I can't get more specific than
that but let's open it up and take a
look so the only thing that sort of
initially tells me this is maybe not the
most expensive mechanical keyboard is
that the cable is not braided other than
that though you know you've got the feel
of the glue switches you've got this
aluminum top plate it just sort of
folded across the top there it is a
plastic housing otherwise but it does
still have some feet at the back so you
can kick it up at an angle and they've
also still included a little key cap
Chloe which is very convenient if you
ever need to pull the key caps off to
clean or if you want to switch the key
caps off with all these you can switch
out to other compatible key caps oh and
did I mention it's also still RGB
hopefully that is somewhat obvious but
yes still RGB and you can still use the
keys just like I showed you before to
add different colors green blue red and
so on and so forth there's other
lighting functions you can do in there
like I'm just pressing around a bit oh
look there we go
that that's what I wanted I wanted some
rainbow vomit just to show like yes it's
RGB and here you can see there's also a
more standard layout for the key caps
these are somewhat concave this is thank
you let's see we've got some function
keys over out here on the side but no
numpad so you'd be relying on the top
keys for that but of course if you do
need a full sized version this is
available in that as well with these UK
550 just a couple more keyboards here we
have moved into the Mk Series MK is
master keys that means it's cooler
masters top-of-the-line series and they
have come out with an MK 730 the MK 750
was formerly their flagship in this
range and that was a full-size keyboard
that had stuff like a magnetic key pad
and a extra RGB accents that go around
the frame of the keyboard itself and
overall they're top-notch construction
and build quality as well as of course
Cherry MX switches once again these are
using cherry MX red switches so from my
understanding when
master came out with the MK 750 keyboard
a lot of people were like I like it but
it's too big it was a lot of people like
these little 10 keyless keyboards
whether it's just to give you a little
bit more room on the right side for your
mouse movement or if you'd like to have
it portable or if you just never use a
numpad and you'd rather not waste your
money on extra mechanical switches for
the numpad that you're not actually
gonna use so here your box contents you
have again a nicely braided cord here
and once again type-c thank you so much
cooler master for switching all of these
keyboards over the type-c connections
it's so much better and then you've got
an extra set of key caps here these are
purple and these are for your WASD keys
and a few that are right next to it as
well as an escape key and they've also
included a key cat puller in there too
now for the master keys keyboard
Schouler master has an inset for your
USB type-c cable right there and that's
still allow you to route it off to the
side if you want to via one of these
channels or you can just write it
straight back and out the front and here
you can also probably see the accent
lighting going across the front of the
keyboard and then here's that nice cushy
wrist rest this does have a very nice
feel to it sort of a soft dry it's not
leather but it's something close to it
and then it does have some magnets on it
so it'll kind of cozy up to the keyboard
itself and stay in place
beyond that once again 10 kilos over
here so go over the MK 750 if you want
your 10 key on there to same function
buttons here for controlling your RGB
lighting so you can switch between
different modes or per key or anything
like that there is an RGB rainbow effect
for you guys to get a better idea of the
yes these are our GP mechanical switches
and then on the bottom you still have
the feet that you can pop up to give
yourself a bit of declination as you are
typing and just an overall bit more
finished look with the wraparound of the
brush metal edge on the side actually
kind of like how it goes from brush
metal to kind of a texture bit on there
it's just a little nice aesthetic touch
and there you have it cooler master is
very popular flagship keyboard the MK
750 now available in 10 keyless as the
MK 7:30 so guys that is gonna wrap it up
for this video my unboxing and quick
look at a bunch of different cooler
master peripherals let me know what you
guys thought of this video because every
time I get a bunch of stuff like that
I'm like ah should I do a single more
in-depth video on one of these things or
should I just show everyone what arrived
really quickly like I've done today but
hopefully you know
more aware of some products that you
weren't aware of before maybe you're
even considering buying some of them if
you are there are links down in this
video's description to the products at
least the ones that are available right
now so check those out if you're
interested also hit the thumbs up button
