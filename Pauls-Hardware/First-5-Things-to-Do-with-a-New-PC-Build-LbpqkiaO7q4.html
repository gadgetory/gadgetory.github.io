Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be the first five things that you should
do after you have set up a brand new
computer and I'm going to start off with
an apology you see on behalf of myself
and others like me who have done videos
on YouTube about how to build a computer
I'm sorry I'm sorry if I've ever built
the system gotten to this point where
it's all put together press the power
button to turn things on and then leave
you guys with this reboot or select
proper boot device or insert boot media
and select the boot device and press it
key we'll do this and we'll build the
system and think hey everything's good
to go you've built a new computer but
can you really use this computer in the
state no you can't you need to like
install Windows there's a few other
things I'd like to do before I install
Windows so that's what this video is
going to be about it is a tutorial so
I'm going to be walking you through
everything step by step now to be doing
some screen capture and all that kind of
good stuff so you can keep pressing a
button and nothing will happen but let's
do something more productive and gather
the essential tools that you will need
for today's tutorial now apart from the
computer that you just built nice and
fresh and new you will of course need a
keyboard and mouse you'll need a monitor
to connect it to and then you will be
needing an internet connection as
represented by this purple Ethernet
cable right here beyond that you will
also need another computer because
you're going to need something else to
connect to the internet with to mainly
get Windows 10 setup on a USB Drive but
also just in case you need to download
some drivers before your new computer
has internet connectivity you will need
a USB Drive so this is just a little 8
gig drive you need for gigs minimum and
I recommend USB 2 or USB 3 if you want
things to go at any kind of reasonable
speed finally and this is just a fair
warning to any guys who are actually
using this as you tutorial 4 and upgrade
upgrading a system or installing windows
on a system that might have data or
something on there already an external
drive something that you can plug into
the system lots working copy everything
onto it again there's nothing to copy
off of this one right now since this
brand new but make sure that if you have
any personal information pictures my
documents anything that's irreplaceable
that you can't read download from the
web like basic program installers and
stuff get that onto an external drive
unplug it set
side that way and know that even if
something terrible goes wrong you will
still have your data and you can rebuild
everything the way it was before then
the last thing you'll need it for being
thorough is a Windows 10 license you can
get those for fairly cheap via King wind
net and I'll post a link to my video
about that right here that place is not
a hundred percent on the up-and-up
according to some people there's
arguments that go on about that so if
you do want to buy a full license that
should work just as well but the way I'm
going to have this set up for you is
once you install Windows you can start
using it and then in the future when you
get your Windows key you just type that
in plug it in and then it will activate
you'll be good to go step one of this
process though is going to be to test
everything which we kind of did at the
beginning or the end of the build video
where we powered it on and we saw that
fans were spinning so I've got this fan
I installed on side panel here that
one's spinning the systems on I can see
that the front fan there is spinning as
well power supply fan is spinning the
only fans it might not be spinning are
the ones on the graphics card some newer
graphics cards will only spin the fans
when the graphics card actually gets
warm enough to need that so we can
visually look and say alright fans are
spinning we're good to go but there are
a few other things you should probably
check on to do those additional checks
we will need to access the UEFI also
known as BIOS at some points I can reach
the power button of course right after
you power the system on just start
tapping the delete button on your
keyboard it is almost always a delete
button I haven't encountered any modern
key or modern motherboard that uses
anything other than deletes but by
tapping that button right as the system
powers on it tells the system let's go
into the UEFI or the BIOS now the BIOS
or UEFI is a great thing to get a little
bit familiar with you don't need to know
all of the ins and outs of it but
basically understand that this is part
of the motherboard so once we install
windows onto one of the drives over here
these are kind of two separate entities
but we can make some changes here and
check some stuff in the UEFI before
we've even installed Windows to the
drive and we can also make sure that
when we do install windows everything is
going to go nice and smooth the first
thing I like to do is just basically a
reality check so this is going along
with checking everything in the system
to make sure it's all up and running
most bios's are new and improved'
updated bios UEFI versions do have Mouse
support and they also frequently have an
easy mode which is what we're looking at
right
you can see it says easy mode in the top
left this is the BIOS for the B 150 M
Pro for V from asrock and it gives us a
quick look at for instance what's
installed so we can see our AI v 6500
CPU has been recognized there as well as
its processor speed we can see DRAM
information here so dims a 1 a 2 B 1 and
V 2 and we can see that it is
recognizing to a gig sticks installed
there which is what we installed so
that's good 2 down here for storage
configuration you can see all the plugs
that we might connect storage drives to
and since I have unplugged the 2
terabyte drive already and I'll show you
the hat why I did that in just a sec I
can see that all I've connected right
now is my SanDisk SSD that's the only
one that's recognized I can even see
fans over here there's only 3 headers on
the board and I have fans connected to
all 3 of them and all of them are
reporting back that the fans are
spinning so that's nice too now you
might also take a look at your
temperatures which are reported up here
CPU temperatures between 30 and 50
degrees Celsius are usually normal for
being reported in the BIOS it's also got
motherboard temperature voltage a little
bit more advanced stuff if you're
willing to get into it
one thing you should pay attention to is
going to be boot priority now again
right now we only have a single drive
connected so it's only showing a single
drive here but if I plugged in another
drive it would also show here and we
need to choose which one we want to boot
to so you can set that boot priority in
the BIOS if you want to or you can use a
shortcut key it happens to be f11 on
this motherboard also while the systems
starting up and then you can just tell
it for one-time use boot from this USB
or boot from this hard drive this should
give you a pretty good at a glance idea
of what's connected what's being
recognized which should hopefully be all
of the stuff that you installed however
one other thing that you might want to
do and this is a being thorough type of
step is to check all the other different
stuff on the motherboard all the other
different connection points that might
not have things connected to them for
right now so for instance our DRAM is in
slots of a2 and b2 right now we could
power the system down completely switch
off the power supply and then move those
two dims over to the to a 1 and B yeah a
1 and B 1 slots then power back on and
make sure they recognize there as well
just to make sure all the all the DIMM
slots on the motherboard work there's
other things we could test I recommend
USB ports on the front if you have
drives plugged into there they should
show up here in the BIOS
as well and then there's other stuff
that you might check as you go on
further through the installation process
and definitely make sure you have
checked everything by the time you got
windows up and running which would also
include all these ports on the back
panel so the other USB ports back here I
have currently plugged in the monitor
via the HDMI plug on the graphics card
down here at the bottom you can check
the video outs on the motherboard
themselves even though you're not trying
to use them then of course the audio
there and possibly even the other
display outs on the graphics card again
that's being completely thorough I'll
admit I don't usually do all that stuff
but it is something that would be good
to check right off the bat just in case
you have a faulty port or something like
that it's better to spot it now while
you're still within your return policy
period than waiting until much later
down the line
speaking of shutting down though I mean
hit f10 which is almost always the
shortcut for save changes and exits if
not there should be another option there
on in the BIOS to do it not all BIOS
sees are the same and now the system's
restarting which I didn't really want it
to do I wanted it to shut off if you
don't have windows installed yet and you
need to shut off you should be able to
just push the power button and it should
turn off if it doesn't you can hold in
the power button until the system shuts
down that's kind of a brute force way of
doing it and I recommend doing that if
it's a last-ditch scenario or if you're
just in pre operating system stuff in
that case it won't really matter too
much a brief in between step here before
we move on to the finer points of
installing Windows is I only like to
have the drive I'm installing Windows to
actually connected while I'm going to
the installation process so what I did
here with my 3.5 inch drive which are
just going to be storage as I just went
and unplugged the SATA cable from it
which is pretty simple you can actually
plug just the SATA data cable or you can
unplug the power cable one or the other
either way the dry won't work anymore at
least won't be recognized as connecting
to the system and then of course power
the system back on again and press
delete again to go back into the BIOS
again and then a couple settings in
there we want to make sure we have set
properly so now that I'm back in the
UEFI there's two things I would almost
always like to do with the new build in
the UEFI before I move on to the actual
installation of Windows now I just hit
f6 and that's to go over to Advanced
Mode and like I was saying most of these
newer motherboards have an easy
here with more of a more familiar or
friendly graphical interface but then
also in advanced mode which is going to
be more familiar for people who have
used older UEFI or BIOS interfaces
before that's got a list of topics
across the top that you can sort of
switch between each one has a bunch of
sub settings down below so the main
again will just kind of give you an idea
of everything that's connected you can
also add favorites here all we're going
to do with this one is we're going to
check the memory speed and the settings
for the storage memory speed is listed
here under Oct ker you can go to DRAM
configuration and then there's timings
and different clocks that you can set
the frequency of the memory that I have
chosen is that I have installed here is
20 666 however since this is not a z170
board it's actually not allowing me to
access those because intel sees those as
OC or overclock speeds they're not
supported on this type of motherboards
so this is one reason why you might
actually consider a z170 motherboard for
your motherboard of choice rather than
something some more along along the
budget lines like an H 170 or an H 150
or the B 150 that I have installed right
now because it will allow you to access
those now this isn't a huge deal memory
speed running at 2133 is just fine
but it is something that I would do if I
had a z170 board I'll show you that in
just a second the other thing I would do
on a z170 board is or I would done just
about any board is again try to look at
my storage configuration and in storage
configuration here we can see the SATA
controllers as well as the mode that
they are set to now this being an AZ
rack board and being a more budget board
it doesn't have the settings that I
would typically see here which would be
the choice for the whole controller of
HCI or raid or older legacy IDE mode
this does have the ability to tell the
motherboard what type of device you have
connected so I have gone and chosen a
solid-state drive here so that for the
purposes of this motherboard scene is
it's going to be all we can do to tell
it what to do as far as our storage
connectivity so switch real quick and
now I've plugged the the system back
here in so we can take a look at that
UEFI which is a little bit more advanced
this is an X 99 mother
word and here you can see again the same
sort of basic layout although I have to
get further away to use the mouse for
this computer so again this is the easy
mode that we're looking at first we can
see memory listed up here I don't know
what the deal is with the memory speeds
I'm not worrying about that for neck
right now fans and all that good stuff
that you might expect to see so really
similar to what we saw with asrock BIOS
over here in Advanced Mode though when I
twitch i can access with f7 we can see a
little bit more things that we can do so
over here an AI Tweaker I can actually
go and access the DRAM stuff and that
will allow us that will allow me to set
the deviant frequency I can actually
just manually set it here depending on
whatever the memory is that I purchased
so if I bought a 2800 speed kit of
memory I could just set that like that
or we can use the XMP settings which
should be available make their backup
here yes XMP right there which will
automatically set the XMP setting for
the memory at 2667 which is the kit that
I have currently installed now the other
thing I was talking about is storage
configuration so over here it under
advanced we have PCH storage
configuration and in here we have the
ability to change the actual mode of the
SATA controller that we're looking at
now the reason I bring this up is simply
because it will save you a lot of hassle
in the future if you're planning on
doing raid most of these right now will
default to HCI that's what you'll get
and that's what you should stick with
whether you use an SSDs or hard drive
IDE is a legacy mode I don't recommend
using that it's really not necessary for
new computers it's made so you can have
backwards compatibility but you don't
need that you'd much rather have faster
connectivity and a little bit more
efficiency so you want a HCI if you do
plan on doing raid either now or in the
future
switch to RAID mode now even if you're
just using a single drive you can still
have a single drive with Windows
connected windows installed on it using
RAID mode what am i doing though this
isn't even the right computer let me
switch back there are of course lots of
other things you could do in the UEFI
our BIOS but I want to keep this simple
so let's move on to the next stage which
is going to be creating that Windows 10
installer USB so grab your USB drive
make sure you have another computer set
up
got this one right over here and of
course you're going to need an internet
connection in order to download the iso
and iso is basically like a snapshot of
a CD or a disk image or something you
download that iso which is the data and
then you use the Windows installation
app to take that and shove it onto here
and then this becomes the Installer and
you can use that to shove Windows 10 on
to your SSD not to be too technical
about it next up we're actually going to
create the Windows 10 USB installer so
for that go over to this website it's a
Microsoft comm site that's linked in the
video description and you're going to
want to download the media creation tool
just by clicking the download tool Now
button and then that should start to
download once the Downloads finish you
can launch the media creation tool and
you should see it pop up just like this
you need to agree to the license terms
and then it'll take just a moment to get
set up this will basically download the
Windows 10 ISO and plop it on to that
USB Drive for you we don't want to
upgrade this PC we want to create
installation media for another PC and
click Next the defaults here should be
just fine you want Windows 10 and you
want 64-bit you'd have the option to
select others if you want to we want to
choose USB flash drive and the hit next
it will then go on to our system and it
only found one viable drive to use here
so that's the one we want to choose hit
next again and it will start to the
installation so once that media creation
tool is all finished you should have
your drive with the Windows installation
files on it so we'll eject that from our
other computer and connect it to our new
computer here it is I'm just going to
plug it in the back here oh yeah I'm
still in the BIOS here so let's go ahead
and save and reset and remember how I
told you about that boot menu the boot
menu is important right now because what
we want to tell the computer is that USB
Drive that I just plugged in we now want
to boot from so I have tapped f11 as a
system of starting and this brought me
to this menu right here which will
actually let me individually choose to
boot from anything that's connected so
this is the SATA Drive this is what it
would default to I just
put in this new USB disk so I'm gonna
click on that and it should immediately
start booting off of that and it should
show cool a Windows 10 logo right there
in the middle which means it's
initiating loading up the Windows 10
installer environment awesome here we go
a language time and keyboard inputs
English Works install now note that you
can also repair your computer with this
tool so don't get rid of this USB or
reformat it once you've actually gone
through the setup we'll hit OK and again
just a couple more seconds to wait now
here is an important part you can
activate windows and actually punch your
license in right here if you want to or
you can click this button I don't have a
product key which I'm going to do right
now this will let you go through with
the installation and then you'll be able
to input your product cue later we'll
just go with Windows 10 Pro just to
start out with again if you enter a
product key for a different version
later on like home it will just change
the version that you have installed I
accept the license and click Next and
then here we almost what we definitely
want to click custom rather than upgrade
you can use this to upgrade from an old
computer but custom is always a way like
I like to go now fortunately we have
pretty much a brand new SSD or at least
I've made that SSD look like a brand new
SSD there so we only have a single drive
drive zero and that is because I
disconnected all the other drives now
you might see more stuff here you might
see drive 0 with a partition and then
drive 0 with another partition if that
is a case I recommend selecting all
those partitions and using the delete
button to delete them all until you just
have unallocated space you just want a
nice blank empty drive to work with here
one final trick and this is kind of a
little bit more advanced but I will tell
you guys how to do it if you hit shift
f10 in this menu you can pull up a
command prompt and this will allow you
to do a bit more fanciness if you really
have problem installing to the drive
that you're installing to now I would
say only is this in dire scenarios if
you don't see a drive listed here at all
for example you might need to click load
driver and in this case you might need
to download a driver from say your
motherboard manufacturers website and
then load it up here by clicking browse
and then that would allow you to say you
just put it on the same installation USB
that you had windows 10 on and then you
could select it there load up a driver
and then that
tell the Windows 10 installer how to
talk to how to talk to the hardware that
you're currently working with we're not
going to do that though but I will show
you how to totally clean a drive if it's
necessary so shift f10 to get here to
the command prompt type disk part the is
kPa RT that will launch this utility
type list disk to words that will tell
you the disks that are currently
connected again we have that disk 0
which is the SSD and there's nothing
wrong with it right now it's a 240 HP
SSD about 220 3 gigs formatted and then
we also have disk 1 which is the 8 gig
drive that Windows is currently loading
off of now if we wanted if disk 0 was
giving us some issues if we were getting
an error like e we can't install there
or something all we do is type select
disk 0 and then it will tell you it's
the selected disk and then type clean
and then hopefully it will tell you that
it succeeded and cleaning the disk and
then you can type exit there more stuff
things there are more things you can do
at this part but I don't want to I don't
want to distract you guys too much from
that anyway then you hit refresh our
potential you might need to restart the
system and reload back into this
operating system environment but the
drive should then pop up there if it
should at least give you the option to
install into it and then just hit next
and then it should automatically go
through this next process and it'll tell
you as it goes copying files getting
files ready installing in bla bla let's
come back when this has gone through the
motions so one of the really nice things
about installing Windows 10 off of a USB
Drive as opposed to the older
installation method of installing from a
optical disk is it's a lot faster this
whole process has only taken somewhere
in the 10 to 15 minute range and you'll
note that since I used the f11 to boot
off of that USB Drive I didn't change
the boot order that the motherboard has
set up so after it did the initial
installation off of the USB Drive it
restarted the system and then it went
back automatically and started booting
off of the SSD if you've gone into the
motherboard boot order and you've told
it to install off the USB Drive it can
go through that initial setup process
reboot and then boot off of the USB
Drive again and
go back into that installation
environment if it does that just shut
the computer down unplug that disk and
then boot it again and it should go and
start loading off of the stuff that's on
the SSD or whatever drive you installed
to now this is the going fast page and
we want to only we always want to
customize here and this is where you can
turn off the features that has Windows
10 track use so I literally turn every
single one of these switches off there
are two pages of them I don't want it to
do any of these things I don't want it
to automatically connect to hotspots the
one thing I sometimes leave on is using
smart screen online services to help
protect against malicious content and
downloads in sites loaded by windows
browser browsers and Store apps that one
I think is okay to leave on anyway
everything else turn off hit next and in
just a moment we'll be able to set up oh
well right now we will be able to set up
whether we're going to be using this
computer by itself or as part of a
Microsoft account I usually use it by
itself on this computer 11 because it's
a in a core 1100 and then you would
always want to enter a password I'm not
going to do that for right now just for
the sake of simplicity but use a
password it's it's a really good way to
keep your computer much more secure I'm
going to pass on using Cortana for now
as well and I think I think Windows 10
is like almost installed now it's the
exciting part you just you never know
when it's going to finish
oh good let's start well I don't think
I've been doing a very good job of
calling out the numbers for my five
things here but that is the end of thing
4 which is installing Windows 10 Windows
10 is now installed let's move on to the
fifth thing which is just going to be
some of the basic set up procedures that
you would want to go through in order to
make sure Windows 10 is working properly
now you might notice I haven't actually
connected the internet to this computer
at this point because I was waiting for
the moment of truth to find that out now
here's another fun thing Windows 10 the
Installer the information that is on
this little USB Drive only has a certain
amount of info when it comes to
different hardware that it might
encounter hardware that it encounters
that it doesn't understand how to use it
needs a driver for so
we're going to be doing is installing
drivers to make sure the different
individual elements the graphics card
and the chipset in different parts of
the motherboard will play nicely with
Windows 10 the other thing and the
reason this was a moment of truth is you
might notice when I plugged in just now
it immediately recognized that I'm
connecting to a network if it's a home
network you know to do what it says I
want it yes since this is a home network
now if you plugged in the Internet and
it didn't work it would mean that the
Windows 10 operating system does not
have an up-to-date driver for your
network specifically and that's an
important one to get connected because
that means you have internet connection
if you have just a network connected
then you can connect to the internet to
download everything else you need as far
as drivers go now since this did work
I'm going to just load up the asrock web
sites and we'll go there so I'm just
going to jump over to the asrock web
sites this is the specific page for the
motherboard the B 150 M Pro for V and
depending on the manufacturer your
layout might be different here I don't
know why it took me to the memory
support list but let's go to the
download page and then you can see the
different drivers and utilities here you
would select your operating system we
just installed Windows 10 64 bit so
we'll go with that
and then you would download the
individual drivers that you might want
now the ones that I'm going to download
right now include the audio driver the
driver INF which is the one that's for
the chipsets the Intel management engine
driver
I'll also be downloading the land driver
even the LANs working might as well get
the up-to-date one I'm not going to do
the app charger that is asrock software
that's optional this is a say too floppy
image this is what we would would have
needed before we installed Windows 10
when when I did that load driver option
if it wasn't recognizing the controller
for the hard drives that we I connected
again we don't need that for now I will
get the Intel Rapid Storage Technology
driver and then the VGA driver is if
you're using the Intel if using the
Intel built-in graphics since we're
using Nvidia we will go to the Nvidia
website to download those and from the
nvidia geforce driver website we can
select the manual driver search since we
know what GPU we just install
it's a ten sixty and we're on Windows 10
60 with back where to go
Windows 10 64 bits and we'll hit start
search and it will download the latest
game ready drive and there are all my
downloads going and Windows 10 will
automatically download downloads to the
Downloads folder and there they all are
right there now that all of our drivers
have finished downloading here we'll go
ahead and install them one at a time I
like to make folder on the desktop call
it drivers keep things a little bit
organized and I usually start with the
chipsets and then after that the order
doesn't really make too much of a
difference I don't think but I will
unpack one load it up hit set up chipset
and start to realize all the little
tweaky things I need to do with Windows
10 to make it actually behave and do
what I want and I will just hit next and
accept and install and it will start
installing things there no big deal and
it means it nope Oh God
come back screen it's just thinking
about things this is what happens while
you install drivers by the way it's
usually not a big deal oh good
changed the layout there anyway while
we're doing this we can hit view over
here and go to options and change our
folder options and change open X File
Explorer to this PC and go to view and
you know hit the display and show hidden
files and don't hide empty drives and
especially don't hide extensions for
known file types that's stupid and then
we hit okay and that makes things
slightly better oh now we can tell that
this is an executable for more fun tips
like this checked out my first five
things I do with a new Windows
installation it's still mostly relevant
even though it's a Windows 8
installation as talking about there all
right one other thing to point out when
you're installing drivers if it tells
you to restart restart don't wait don't
hit restart later just just restart give
it a second just do things in the proper
order and come back and then continue
along the way
now one thing you might notice is you're
going through here and installing
drivers and stuff is the windows is also
doing things on its own like for example
I now have an Nvidia control panel even
though I haven't installed the Nvidia
drivers yet windows will automatically
download wh QL or Windows Home qualified
but I forget what it's called it's the
Windows list where they have said yes
these drivers are valid however they're
not always up to date so even the
windows downloaded this Nvidia driver
which is better than the default driver
is using it's still 3:7 2.90
so i would still recommend rather than
just letting windows make all your
decisions for you still download the
latest drivers so for instance here's
the Nvidia driver that I just downloaded
which is a little bit more up-to-date
than the one that Microsoft downloaded
for me so we'll hit OK there and we'll
go ahead with the driver installation
for the graphics of course I still have
all the other ones here that I
downloaded the Lion driver and
management engine and stuff so I'll
continue with those but we also need to
do one other important thing we're
getting much more closer to being able
to just started going willy-nilly and
installing steam and installing like
other apps and stuff like that 9 night
ni ni te is a great website to do that
for all those little apps that you would
go and download individually you can
actually just choose a bunch of them
with checkboxes and it will download an
installer that does them all at the same
time what I'm going to do right now
though is something that I should
probably do while the systems off but
for SATA it's usually not a big deal I'm
going to plug this hard drive back in so
I'm restarting after having plugged that
3.5 inch drive in up at the top my plan
here is to show you guys how to
configure that drive to use as an
additional piece of storage so you can
start copying stuff over onto it and
dropping it there since that was last
thing to plug in as well I guess I can
also replace this side panel so if you
connect up your additional storage drive
and you open up this PC and you don't
see it listed there all we still have is
just our normal hard drive if it's a
brand new hard drive this is what will
happen what we need to do is go into
computer management
so right-click this PC and go to manage
and then we want to click on disk
management over here this will
automatically pop up something that
tells us our disks are not initialized
this is like a little wizard disick that
goes here I'm going to cancel this real
quick but if that does pop up for you
just go ahead and use it here we can see
our drive is connected it is recognized
it's simply not initialized and there's
nothing allocated on it so I can right
click here and go to initialize it
brings up that same little wizard this
is the disk we want to initialize you
can choose MBR or GPT always choose GPT
if it's a larger than 2 terabytes hard
drive I'm going to go with I'm gonna go
GPT I think that should be fine
go with MBR if it's a smaller driver if
you really need to make sure it will
still be able to connect to older
computers and finally even with that
then the drive still not doesn't show up
here in this PC because it's not
allocated so now I can see the disk no
little red mark indicating there's
anything wrong it is initialized
right-click on that unallocated space
click new simple volume then again this
will take you through wizard yes you
want to drive letter format it using
NTFS default allocation unit size is
fine give it a label we'll call it 2
terabyte storage because that's what
it's going to be quick format if you
don't want to be waiting for an hour to
for a mechanical hard drive to format
although if it is a used drive you might
consider doing a full format and just
bear in mind it's going to take a little
while hit ok it'll take just a second or
two to format the drive and then it
should pop up just as a new Drive would
or like a USB Drive or something like
that if you popped it in and again
depending on the speed is Drive and how
how things are going with it it might
take more time or less time but there is
2 terabyte storage so now we have a new
empty 2 terabyte drive to drop all of
our other excess crap on to or if we did
something like using a mechanical drive
or an external drive and we had copied a
bunch of stuff from old computer now as
we can connect it back up put it all in
that extra storage drive and then we'd
be good to go there is one last thing I
think here that I should mention when it
comes to initial setup which is Windows
updates always always check for updates
it's pretty straightforward but windows
will do this automatically itself but I
highly recommends just doing it yourself
if it's a brand new installation you'll
just you know get things up-to-date more
quickly type update go to the Windows
Update on the settings menu click check
it will guaranteed find a bunch of
updates and it will automatically
download them and then from here you can
also prompt it to automatically restart
as well whenever it's finished and I
usually do that restart if it asks me to
run it again restart again and if it
asked me to again just get everything up
to where it should be for security
purposes as well as making sure that if
you're going to start benchmarking or
something like that you don't have it
trying to do this in the background
while you're trying to do something else
entirely
like running benchmarks speaking of
benchmarks that's all for this video and
yes I have been running benchmarks on
this system in both of its
configurations so as a 6,100 core i3
with a rx 460 as well as what it is now
which is a 6500 Core i5 and the GTX 1060
from Nvidia compare both of those
systems to each other in this
configuration it's about a $750 system
overall not including the operating
system the other configuration was a
little bit less than 500 but I'm sure a
lot of you guys are curious to know how
much more power you get by going for an
extra 200 $300 in price for the initial
build I have numbers for those will be
up very soon thank you guys so much for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
hit the thumbs up button down there to
freedom leave comments in the comment
section as well if you have any
questions about the detailed stuff or
any issues as you're installing windows
I will try to answer them and I'm will
I'd like to say huge thank you to those
of you guys who who do go on in the
comments section of my videos and get
help and advice and support to other
people because there's actually a lot of
people given really good advice so I'm
always proud when I see that thanks
again for watching this video guys and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
