by fractal design and WD to learn more
about their products and to say thank
you for supporting paul's hardware go
ahead and click on the sponsor links in
this video's description what's up
everyone and welcome to pauls harbor
coverage of CES 2015 wow my voice is
just catalogue what's up guys and
welcome to pauls hardware coverage of
CES 2015 I had to start out by
apologizing because my voice just
decided to go out the window last night
but I'm going to press on anyway so if
you can deal with my voice I'm going to
visit quite a few places today since
this video is covering a lot of that
content i'm going to put some shortcuts
right over here so you can click on
those to jump to the specific thing you
want to see I however need to get on the
road and start checking out some of the
awesome stuff on display here at CES
we're visiting Kingston they have three
new products here ministry real quick
first off as a 64 gig micro SD flash
card now the cool thing about this is
it's faster so 90 megabytes per second
reads in 80 megabytes per second rate so
if you're shooting 4k that's fantastic
it's also got some more durability built
into it so it's like x-ray proof and
shockproof and stuff like that so if you
have like one of the new GoPros that
shoots in 4k or something like that and
you need sturdy high-capacity storage
this is going to be a great option for
you all right next up we have this
little guy it's a data traveler so
basically this is going to give you
security for your data via hardware
encryption it's also got some cloud
services built in so you you could have
this plugged into your computer at home
and I use Internet services to access
the data on it and it will also lock out
your data if unauthorized access is
attempted in much of time so that's
really cool for security we also have
the new HyperX cloud 2 headset now we
talked we talked down on a lot of
headsets here now that we've become
audio files but the HyperX cloud is one
that consistently gets really good
reviews they've done some updates to it
they have some new colors available
right now we're looking at a grey and we
also have a reddish sort of darker red
version here they have 7.1 sound that's
now integrated via this little hardware
controller so you can plug that into
your system and you got an inline
controller for it as well they've also
added some additional padding and if
you're liking these headsets
later this year towards the summer
they're going to come out with a white
version of this with pink trim for the
ladies out there or perhaps Linus the
Kingston product that I'm probably most
excited about is this hyperx predator
which is an m dot to SSD it's it's PCI
gen3 it'll do fourteen hundred megabytes
per second reads and 1000 megabytes per
second writes this thing is amazing
they're planning to launch it I think
within the next couple months to be
available as a standalone just to dry
just the little SSD itself it's got a
black PCB so if it's visible in your
system it's going to look a lot nicer
it's also available with the PCA the
riser card so you can drop it in if you
want to Kingston's also refreshing their
hyperx SSD line they now have these
savage SSDs they're going with a faisan
controller now oh by the way the
controller on the predator is marvel
ulta they have a flies on a 10
controller though for the HyperX savage
so they moved away from San or from San
force which a kettle like which means
it's going to give you better
compressible read and write performance
and if you're wondering about the
performance of the new savage drive it's
this red line right here and as you can
see it's right there in line with all
the competing drives at least in d
if you're wondering about the
performance of the predator right there
available in for terminator gig capacity
Wow 1556 that is a monster school for a
sssd for storage i am now at the
gigabyte area and i just have a couple
things to share with you guys because
gigabyte has a lot of products but most
of them you might have already heard of
but this is new is the x 99 SOC champion
now honestly this motherboard is not for
everyone it's designed for overclocking
which means that gigabyte does things
with it to make sure that it's going to
be really good at overclocking but it
also means they don't necessarily throw
all the extra features into it that they
do with other boards so you might notice
there's only for ddr4 dimm slots and
they move them closer to the socket to
provide a little bit of less latency for
their for overclocking and hitting
records they've already gotten some
memory speed records with i believe
corsair Kingston and g.skill on this
board they also have extra space as a
result so they can add more heat sinks
here to cool the VRMs and that's always
important for overclocking you got all
the requisite overseas stuff over here
like voltage read points and
things you can switch on and off a cool
feature I like is this switch right here
which you can use to switch off or on
the extra pins that are in the socket
which gigabyte has built into this board
it's not part of the Intel spec but you
can do that and I like the option to
switch that on or off so this is really
made for high-end overclockers and for
stuff like exotic cooling and liquid
nitrogen and that sort of thing which is
why it's really not made for everyone
but if you want an orange board maybe
try out the SOC force that's also an OC
board but it's got a bit more extra
features if you're really just going for
world record overclocks check out the
SOC champion I think it's available very
soon we don't have a date yet we also
have a new gigabyte brix unit this one
right here this is Broadwell bricks so
it's the new broad well integrated CPU
from Intel this one is I 750 500 you
it's really cool to see as Intel makes
their CPUs more and more power efficient
how small gigabyte is able to make these
units this one has some add-ons like NFC
on the top at least on the i7 version
and then it's also going to be more
powerful and it should generate less
heat due to the broadwell architecture
with the new CPU so check out the
gigabyte brix s gigabyte continuing that
line of ultra compact computers in the
brick series which are there they're
very popular I gigabyte has a ton of
other stuff on display here like their
water force which is a three-way 980 SLI
configuration that comes with water
cooling stuff integrated check out jay's
video on that he did a great job but I
wanted to show you guys this system if
you guys don't remember at computex is
here we lost a very dear friend from
animax her name was Elaine this is her
dedication system this is the Elaine sue
edition a collaboration between enermax
and gigabyte really really nice system
in there just really well done but but
still kind of brings a tear to my eye
because the lane was so awesome as a rep
when we worked with her we miss her a
lot so Elaine we miss you but it's great
to see this tribute to you here at CES
2015 hey guys we're at the zotac suite
at Caesar's Palace now and they have
among other things some pretty epic case
mods that have been done by BS mods I
really
look at the reservoir on this one right
here absolutely insane a really cool
textured liquid that they have gone in
there and liquid cooling system to which
is really nice they got this other zotac
one which i believe was originally a
thermaltake case that they modded and
put one of their graphics cards up on
top which looks pretty maybe not so
practical but a pretty cool mod
nonetheless we also have of course all
the zotac graphics cards that you may
have seen in the past months they do a
some pretty nice GTX 970 and 1980s but I
wanted to focus a little bit on this guy
right over here this is the GTX 970
extreme core edition and basically zotac
gone they've gone back and switched back
to the Nvidia reference PCB which is
cool because it means if you wanted to
liquid cool this card it would make it
much more compatible with a wide array
of water blocks they've gone with a
three fan solution on the front which is
going to help with cooling they modified
the cooling solution inside and the heat
sinks are set up so it's faster it's
thinner and it's quieter over here by
the window we have a couple more
products the zotac asked us to ask you
guys about this GTX 970 little single
fan edition of a 970 and as you can see
it's got a plastic shroud no backplate
but a very small only 16 pin power
connector is this something that you
guys would be interested in if so let us
know in the comments because this is
something that they aren't selling now
but they're considering and then we also
have the 970 am promega this is another
the ample mega edition is basically
going to be towards the high end of low
tax offering its overclocked so it's got
7,000 10 megahertz memory clock and 1152
megahertz base this will boost up to 13
04 right out of the box and for all the
high-end cards after the nine 70 s and
80 and 1980s zotac goes with all metal
shrouds which is a sort of a subdued
look with the gray finish but it's going
to blend in really nicely with a lot of
systems and they've also been adding
back plates to pretty much all of the
nine 70s and 980 a cell which is a
really nice feature and lastly we have
more case mods there's the skeleton one
over there that Logan was having a good
time with earlier these are all
variations of zotac zbox which is a very
small computer that you guys might have
heard of before they have a lot of
different versions of it but they're
trying to change up the look so they'd
asked some modders to build some
prospective designs that they have on
file here so if you're interested go
over to the zotac facebook page you can
vote on which one you like the best you
can you can win some really cool prizes
including a zotac gtx 980 which is an
excellent excellent price we're stopping
by the England booth because they have
of course the s frame which you will
have probably already seen before they
have it in a gold trim which is pretty
cool as you can see and they've got a
really nice water-cooled system going on
in there which I like but they have a
new case over here kind of based on the
same concept so this is what is known as
the S box rather than the s frame you
might notice it's kind of got the same
concept in that it's one large piece of
aluminum that goes all the way around
the top and that's bent into the shape
of an S but this one has a much more
clothes design then the s frame versus
the sbox pretty pretty standard but
tempered glass panel here on the side
still you have dr cage and storage area
over here on the other side and you can
move these panels access those five and
a quarter inch base io is up on the top
and this one is course is in red and
black finish now in wind has asked me to
ask you guys what you think of this case
because it's not a full production yet
but also if you're interested in it how
much do you think this case would be
worth mayor in mind that bending a
little
is very difficult so keep that in mind
but how much would you pay for a case
like this and does this design interest
you because i know i like the elemental
designs from in wind but practically
speaking they're not always the best I
want to hear from you guys let me know
in the comments and as always at least
in these videos forgive how terrible my
voice is all right everyone thank you
for viewing Paul's hardware is sweet and
seductive edition of the CES 2015
coverage again sorry about my voice I'm
going to rest it tonight tomorrow it
should be better I hope but I don't
forget to click that like button don't
forget to hit the subscribe button if
you haven't already and we'll see you
all very soon cool so bad</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
