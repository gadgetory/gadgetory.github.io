into this word vomit
incoming three in a dive gonna dive
reading gonna plow right through four
three it looks like we're good - it was
a few seconds ago but hey everyone
welcome it's an awesome hardware this is
a live show we talk about technology and
we stream every week to YouTube
we're streaming right now to my channel
pulsar we're in about 30 40 minutes

you're joining us on any of those
platforms except I guess catalyst
channel because we're not streaming is
that right now welcome thanks for being
here a quick word of warning to you we
do occasionally use adult language on
the show and we talk about technology
computers so it's generally pretty
boring I guess but we do also drink beer
so that's it's not boring if you're into
that sort of thing it's not boring I'm
sorry what am I talking about it's very
exciting
why are you even here that it's boring
for people who don't like computers
anything's boring for anyone who doesn't
like something that's true very that's
very true find excitement boring
starting us off today Kyle got today's
beer this is actually really barley
forge Brewing Company it's called the
patsy and it's a coconut rye
stout brewed with natural flavors in
Costa Mesa California
I got it some hippy grocery store that

suds careful there's acid in it hey
Cheers hey everyone a quick plug not a

good things that's getting allowed
no awareness and trips out it's always
in gaming mode and if you do buy stuff
real shout out your name during the
after-party so that'll be fun let's get
into the actual thick of it though with
some actual tech news let's a switch
over here really quick all right why are
people chatting it up in my chat
I'm not even live on my channel right
now go to pulse you're in the wrong
you're on the wrong Chet although if
you're in the wrong can't hear me
telling them that here when they're I
mean maybe they're just chatting in both
maybe it's possible the correct Chet
will send send them the memo they all
will be right that would that would help
I would tech news starting out mm-hmm
we're gonna like a band-aid we're gonna
do the bad news or the sad news first
bad and sad news
telltale games game studio which had
about 250 employees is shutting down
just news there trickle out late last
week there were some varying reports on
it from varying locations including like
whenever something like this happens you
have internal people who are just like
god I'm losing my job anyway so screw it
I'm just gonna be like sweet about
losing my job there was and use an
update directly from Telltale Games a
statement so to speak regarding the
situation so they are maintaining a
skeleton crew of 25 staffers remain on
board to usher in the company's
remaining Walking Dead episodes to see
that through to the end that's one of
the franchises that they oversee as well
as to fulfill the company's obligations
to its board and partners not determine
exactly what that is but at least
finishing that game it's the games in
progress including Walking Dead the
projects in the works that are being
cancelled as a result of telltale biting
biting the dust kicking the bullet
kicking the biting the bullet no kick in
a bucket kicking the bucket yeah any of
those things getting canned by the can
yeah yeah the projects include the wolf
among us series will now be not good not
there anymore there's also a previously
announced series based on the Netflix
show stranger things which who knows
that that would have been good or crappy
that those are canceled - so we'll never
know it's also I'm sure when these types
of things happen if any of their
existing IP will be bought up by another
company and you see resurrected
elsewhere
no word on that but I'm sorry I missed
why they go in under it wasn't really
specified it appears to be from some of
the commentary I read like poor
management's people who were like hey
we're making money let's pretend like
we're gonna keep making that much money
forever and run the company that way I
don't know I mean I'm really not sure it
would be speculation to dive into that
so blame the tariffs it's all the
tariffs on it doesn't ones and zeroes
have anything to do with tariffed we
will talk about the tape primary but
that's this code this is not associated
we should shred it I'm just rats Fred
fake news about the tears just like
anything bad happens in the last couple
weeks but gets a tariff on the tariffs
terms we'll be talking about that later
though cos tonight my for real see my
benchmark runs to lockup okay if you're
not familiar at all the tilts telltale
games they rose to prominence in 2012
with the first game they did based on
the first Walking Dead Season they have
since then produced licensed narrative
headed heavy games based on properties
like Batman minecraft Borderlands and
Game of Thrones so according to that Ars
Technica article which you guys can read
the full thing in the description if you
want to before all that though they also
made the classic point-and-click serious
Sam and Max which you guys may have
heard of oh no Kyle Headen anyway though
what I first actually heard about this
by seeing other developers who were
tweeting out and sympathy to those who
lost their jobs who were working at
telltale and saying like hey guys like I
know there was at least one place who
said they were gonna have a recruitment
drive and we're inviting people because
you know that's a two hundred and I
guess 250 - 25 people losing their jobs
that's a decent amount I wouldn't have
guessed telltale games was that big yeah
I mean little indie developer I mean
they really blood it's a lot of a lot of
work to develop video games oh
definitely yeah no that's that's
unfortunate hopefully they all all that
talent gets spread elsewhere in the
industry though yes hopefully some good
will come of it in the end
all right moving on NCIX is a was what
is a canadian retailer and some news
came out about them just in the past
week I first saw this tweeted by Luke
the friend of Linus media group because
this significantly impacts not just
people who have shopped at NCIX in the
past and you should pay very close
attention if you are a former NCIX
shopper but also absolutely ncx
employees situation was laid out in this
law I don't know if you'd call gonna
cause a blogger a news report article
it's on privacy fly calm and this is a
website that's run by security
researcher Travis Doreen this is a
one-off article as far as I can tell
this isn't like a website that typically
reports stuff like this but if you guys
have never read an article about
something like a like a data breach or
just data that's in the wild and how
it's handled by by people when the
oversight of a company that's in control
of it goes away it was this is a
fascinating article I actually did read
the whole thing and I'm gonna give you
guys just the bullet point summary
because there are quite a few details
but NCIX basically they went they
declared bankruptcy in 28 2017 we
reported we talked about this on a live
show they were a former former rival of
New Age our former employee but
apparently when they closed down they
did not wipe any of the servers that
they had and those servers were also not
encrypted when they were originally set
up which is an unfortunate situation
that you find about with lots of
different companies company went
belly-up and then all of the the servers
and a bunch of hardware was in a
warehouse that where the NCIX owed that
warehouse something like 150 thousand
Canadian which is about a hundred fifty
hundred and fifteen thousand u.s. and
back money for renting the warehouse but
ncx isn't around anywhere so the
warehouse now de facto owns that
equipment because it was just left there
so they're just trying to get rid of it
but the people who end up in charge in
situations like this might not be on the
up-and-up so
the article talks the article is from
the standpoint of Travis who actually
went in and talked to Jeff who's the guy
who listed all this hardware on
Craigslist in Richmond British Columbia
which included just a crap ton of stuff
from NC X's old offices and data center
300 desktop computers from their
corporate offices of retail stores 18
Dell PowerEdge servers to super micro
servers running the star wind I scuzzy
software the ncx had used to backup
their hard disks also 109 hard drives
which have been removed from servers
before auction so they were auctioning
off like the server hardware but pulling
the hard drives off of it that had
images or vital data on it because they
knew that there was value in the
hardware itself and selling that but
there's also value in that data if you
are a shady shitty person willing to
willing to sell other people's personal
data that you technically don't own but
can profit off of which is the situation
that Travis ran into and he talks about
the guy pitching him selling him the
hardware selling him the data doing a
like will leave you the room like there
was there's a there's a pitch where he
says for $15,000 you can rent the room
that has all this stuff in it and
basically he'll just leave and let you
go in there and like bring your own
hardware in and copy it all off an image
it and stuff I'll just turn a blind eye
while you yeah unload all the essential
transfer everything so you have multiple
levels of crap crappiness here from the
people who ended up with this hardware
being very responsible with it from the
nca ex being irresponsible with the way
the data was stored in the first place
and fortunately this is now I don't
become public knowledge but the data
according to Jeff the contact who the
article writer was talking to he had
already sold the data like I think three
or four times at least and he had
another guy who was supposed to like fly
in in December to do that whole rent the
room thing or something so all this is
to say again if you were a format firmer
NCIX customer at all this is all of
their data going back 15 years and the
company's lifespan you
should assume that your data is
compromised your personal information
whether it is talking about name address
it's not a hundred percent sure about
credit card numbers and stuff like that
but just assume that you're compromised
and in particular if you're an employee
because they have employee databases and
records including stuff like a backup
image of the Steve Wu's computer who is
the founder of NCIX and the CEO so a lot
of the personal information which
includes the Canadian equivalent of a
social security number which is called
like a si n or something I forget
exactly what that's called but like
they're not just their payment
information from having placed orders
but their personal information from
applying to the company tax information
stuff like that his has been compromised
too so that's a pretty crappy situation
that's very unfortunate the only
positive really can you can say is that
at least it's public knowledge now so
people who are aware of I can take steps
to protect themselves but my gosh if you
are in a situation where you're doing
data services for a company like I don't
know try to try to impress upon your
superiors the importance of information
security especially in a situation like
this I got it I don't know what lesson
there is to learn from from this or
anything people are suggesting some of
the credit monitoring services that you
can get credit monitoring services are
typically run by the credit company the
the credit companies themselves like
Experian and Equifax and TransUnion so
that's a anyway I don't I don't like the
I don't like how the credit situation
works right now but personal information
and and and you know having having your
data stolen is that's that's pretty
crappy let's move on all right
Windows 10 it is having an update soon
we know that briefly mentioned it and
the reason it is somewhat more
significant for those of us who are in
the PC and PC gaming space is because
the the the graphics cards that we've
been talking about and
benchmarking and doing videos on for the
past week or two have retracing features
and we cannot use them we cannot test
them until Windows gets an update itself
this is promised with the windows update
that's coming up which is called
redstone 5 which is gonna bring
ray-tracing support as well as other
things I was trying to figure out what
the other things are but for the at
least this is a Kotaku article with does
that include like DL SS and stuff for
certain games yeah it's it's it's the
update to like DirectX I believe itself
in order to enable some of these new
features there's a TechRadar article
that has some of the other features that
are also going to be upgraded with this
Windows 10 redstone patch features like
at windows s 0 1 news app and improved
phone integration what Windows 10
redstone 5 is going to revolutionize the
way we used our Windows 10 pcs yeah I
agree I agree yawn for starters can we
and and of course we can't like none of
this is optional it's like an
all-or-nothing type of deal right you
can probably actually end up with it I
mean a lot of the times they integrate
new features and you can just not use
them if you don't really want to and the
most annoying thing is usually there'll
be a pop-up or something because like
hey there's a new feature we did they
let you try it it's like because they
wanted people to try new features it's
like it's like it's like just constant
bloatware that just periodically enters
your system and i with with pop-ups to
remind you that the bloatware is there
and that you should use the bloatware I
completely agree with you in Windows 10
is way more annoying than like Windows 7
ever used to be and stuff like that I I
try to look at that at both sides though
because there there is other stuff going
on under the hood as far as updates and
everything for security they it is
important but yeah be nice if that just
happened in the background and we never
heard heard about it or anything but
it's also a different type of Windows
like we're not expecting Windows 11 or
Windows 12 or anything like that we're
expecting Windows tend to be more like
Windows as a service and I think they
have to sort of change their business
model for
for advertising it and trying to promote
it as as like you useful things that you
get along with Windows so I think that's
part of why they have been pitching
these updates the way that sounds like a
swordfight no one would win yeah no I
completely agree with you Windows 10 is
super annoying a lot of the time and it
kind of sucks but if you want to do the
ray-tracing stuff you're going to need
this new Windows Update and if you are
on Windows 10 then chances are you're
gonna end up with this update eventually
because it'll just it'll just update
itself what are you like how do they
like it or not brute force at some point
it'll just be there necessary evil I
guess other improvements include
improved game mode and game bar which
I've never done never used the game mode
exist I know it exists cuz when you
start a game that's it pops ups like
Windows 10 game stuff oh that seems that
yes oh god like I never do any of it
because you realize it's called feature
called storage sense which will
automatically free up storage space on
your hard drive by getting rid of old
files you don't use anymore which just
sounds scary right like what I would
trust something more like see see see
you later you haven't looked at these
tax returns in like three years
obviously let's just leave those here
are some precious photos of your
firstborn child you imagine it will
hopefully be a bit more intelligent than
that Windows MRR though is mixed reality
so speculation the article that that
could be something to do with hololens
which you're maybe still over I don't
know but the ray-tracing
stuff the stuff for gaming is really the
stuff that's most important so that's
what why we're looking forward to this
update if we are looking forward to this
update you can download and install it
right now if you're part of the windows
insider program which I am NOT you never
mind you're a my maybe I am maybe I did
it like years ago and I still in but and
again it's called redstone five that's
the developers name for it and the
actual name isn't going to be like
creators update or anything they're just
calling it the Windows 10 October 2018
update which I actually like I prefer
that to the creators update emmc or some
garbage more straightforward is the
update that happened on this date and at
this time yeah no flaw and of course
that ray-tracing support support for
some other gaming features will segue us
perfectly into the next segment which is
green stuff a segment Takei
Noel started last week yeah which is
basically just means we have too much
nvidia stuff to talk about all once more
like that's really they've released
graphics cards first time in a couple
years so there's lots of discussion
going on about it
AMD's not doing anything in this space
whether you like it or not there is some
AMD news coming up on calcio yeah show
some some potential mid-range cards
there so we'll see what happens there
but for green stuff though the first
first big news is actually somewhat
valuable if you've been waiting for the
RT x 2070 it's it's got a launch date
now we were promised it in October when
we at games come when I'm video did
their initial announcement of the RT X
series now we know October 17th we don't
know if October 17th is also going to be
when that redstone 5 update comes but
maybe who knows yeah
again this is announced back during the
the gamescom offense all we got though
was price and sort of your basic spec
list and it wasn't a whole lot more than
that other than that vague October
launch date why this is just a battle
field trip are we watching that hey
there's a picture specs look there's
specs that's useful so yeah obviously it
has specs that are less than the r-tx
2080
mm room for CUDA cores there's some
clock speeds listed there 8 gigs of DDR
6 still though so it's got roughly the
same memory configuration as the 2080
still got that virtual link type C port
DisplayPort 1.2 for an HDMI 2.0 be good
stuff
price is 599 dollars for the founders
Edition or 8 $499 if you believe in
videos still damn pardon me
no that's what I'm gonna start saying
now every time I have to every time I'm
talking about this stuff and I have to
list the two prices there's all levels
like the RT X xx atti
$1,200 for the
addition or launch day Twitter bucks
cheaper for the other ones no no same
rice if I founders Edition yes same
price ooh that like you can get it
there's an EVGA one for like 30 bucks
less or something and just it's it's
annoying that they're that they're pit
they keep pitching that low price yeah
when you can never actually buy case in
point over ten series I just did a video
earlier today whereas talking about sort
of landscape of GPUs right now and what
I would recommend you buy or not buy the
1070 you can finally get for less than
the originally announced low end MSRP
yeah like two years and four months
later yeah like that because like I I'm
not sure if you could ever actually buy
it for three hundred and 370 this is
supposed to be something like that so
yeah so from now on whenever I have to
list those two prices and I'm like it's
five butts whatever for the founders
Edition and this much less for that I'm
just gonna say just assume it's gonna be
the founders edition prices and more and
out that it's
Fe and up prices Sam rate racing titles
were also promised one month after the
ITX launch in September 20th which was
just last week but again with that
update for Microsoft there's still no
actual firm launch date so we're not
sure if the 17th will be early enough
there will be late enough I guess for
the redstone 5 update to have happened
for us to be able to even give you great
racing and performance benchmarks and
stuff when that app the odds are
slightly in our favor for it happening
it's on since would be the 17th do you
like just a little bit more than 50% I
kind of vote for as much as that goes I
was somewhat surprised that all of the
features that were being pitched as far
as like what the new cards can do with
their new technology I was surprised
that some that like none of that was
ready online was testable at launched
yeah me too so if there is if there is
gonna be some level of redemption maybe
it would be that they are actually
lining up to 2070 launch date along with
Microsoft to have something like that
ready so that we can actually do some
testing this could also sort of go back
to a lot of people's claims that like
the whole r-tx
lunch was a little bit rushed the main
feature that Jensen spent the whole hour
whatever hour plus talking about wasn't
even ready at launch and I don't know
it's like that means on embargo lifts
day we all had to post like incomplete
reviews I felt like I was posting half a
review because our TX was such a huge
focus around this launch that I was like
and stay tuned for the follow-up just
because we don't know what our TX is
gonna be like you know you can't ever
really fully trust the demos that a
manufacturer puts on display we don't
know how it's gonna affect performance
there are so many still still so many
unknowns well by me about this my big
question is for these titles that are
coming up they're gonna have it that
work that you can test it's gonna be
like turning it on versus turning it off
just visually just looking at the game
like how what kind of a shift are you
gonna be looking at yeah is it gonna be
is it gonna be is it going to look that
much better that you're like I have to
spend five hundred more dollars right on
on a you know I can't get away with the
1080i now I've got to spend five hundred
bucks on the twenty-eighth ETI because I
need to have that that what that looks
like a stretcher assuming the games you
play support it - yeah yeah so that's
that's a big question - um I I want
ray-tracing to succeed ultimately down
the line but you also have to be
reasonable with people when you're
pitching them a product that you're
expecting them to spend a significant
amount of money yet let's move on there
sure okay oh I forgot to do this hey oh
hey it's a question a question I'll put
it in YouTube in a poll here
oh no I'll put an end to it so if you
guys want to post some responses as this
we'll come back to in just a couple
minutes if you were interested in the RT
x 2070 since it was the lowest price of
all the RT x cards when the announcement
happens where if you're excited about it
back when then and that's what happened
has it changed has your outlook changed
now that the 20 80 and 20 TI cards have
launched and you've seen some of their
performance because now we can get a
much better view
idea of what we
back to 2070 performance to be so you're
in a slightly better precision position
to make that assessment I would say
before that though before we look at
responses gigabyte has teased a r-tx 20
atti horas graphics card this is on
video cards calm hey you and this is
somewhat interesting because it would
technically be one of the like really
high end cards we had quite a few
partner cards that were available at
launch but the highest end of those
partner cards which would be like for
EVGA they're classified card for MSI
they're Lightning card for Asus their
matrix card 4 gigabytes their horas card
are usually Oris extreme and yeah
gigabyte hasn't been as consistent with
their top-end card as some of the other
manufacturers but I believe in the past
generation or 2 horas extreme is the top
is the toughest of the topic and they
has gigabyte sent you an RT X card yet
no talk they sent me 100 K but I don't
know if it's that one I don't think it's
this one so light bulb stay tuned for
the after party when we unbox a gigabyte
r-tx card oh ok because I have no I'm
not sure if it's that one or not well
sure they said anyone like yeah they're
supposed to send me something to but it
hasn't has not been confirmed yeah so
obviously it's got lighting it's got a
triple fan configuration one's pretty
well it looks these images give me the
impression that these are addressable
LEDs that's pretty given up they're lit
up individually I mean that's again at
least yeah and it does look like a
pretty substantial card being probably a
three slot or close to three slot design
the article also points out the display
connectors which I guess they're only
really visible in this shot down on this
end it's got 7 display outs Jesus 7
display connectors it looks like three
HDMI three DisplayPort and that in doing
hype super 104 virtual link yeah which
can be virtual link I believe it can
also just act as a display for it out
yeah
via via USB see so that's interesting
I'm imagining they're pitching that for
multi-monitor and/or VR configure agents
which is interesting to have that for VR
when there's the virtual link there but
you know this if you want to if you want
to like get one of the original HTC
vibes that uses all those connectors and
save some money versus the newer ones
yeah I guess there's still some fringe
end users out there yeah so that's
really all there is to it
twelve plus plus two phase of erm did I
say that special special custom PCB vrm
design and everything the shroud the
shroud is like I think that's gonna be
hit or miss that's the thing I'm most
concerned about because it looks like it
could either be like really nice like
the design is cool but if it's if it's
low quality and that's where they made
their margins then it could look and
feel really cheap yeah cuz like is this
plastic or metal exactly yeah do you
care Lumina you prefer it be plastic so
it doesn't cause GPU say I'd preferred
be aluminium and so it'd be lighter and
then not have GPU said titanium we need
a titanium alloy I would hope it would
be perfect vibranium bring me one of
those black diamonds yeah
part of the reason that you don't see
the those highest end skews right at
launch is because the manufacturers
typically reserved GPUs that can perform
very well that have very high ASIC
quality so they can be overclocked from
the manufacturer better and they can
reliably confirm that they'll be able to
stay at those higher clock speeds so
bidding is part of the situation that
we're waiting on for cards like this but
cool gigabyte might have theirs out soon
one more story here linked in the
description and this is from tech power
up this is a story on our TX 2828 eti
PCI Express scaling and I just I just
found this somewhat interesting and I
wanted to point it out tech power up
does this every generation where they
look at plugging in your GPU two
different PCI Express connection
standards
or different bandwidths Bend widths by 1
by 4 by 8 or by 16 sure I like this
chart for example that they put in here
showing the Roth theoretical maximum
bandwidth and this is single direction
so for pcie 3.0 you can see for example
you're at 15 760 which is roughly double
that of pcie 2.0 by 16 which was roughly
double that a PCIe 1.1 by 16 so you can
kind of see when you go back generations
like half of 3 point out half of 3.0 so
exciting for 3.0 16 2 by 8 will give you
about the same as 2.0 by 16 and for 2.0
by 16 2 2.0 by 8 will give you about the
same as 1 point 1 by 16 and also about
the same as 3.0 by 4 yeah
point being let's skip to the results
like we all do as you can see and this
articles linked in the description
everyone should go read the whole thing
so point being relative performance to
tested nineteen twenty twenty by ten
eighty 2560 by 1440 m4k and you only
should really be concerned about this if
you're dropping below by eight which
honestly should be most of the concern
for most people I don't think too many
people are currently considering a PCIe
gen 2 solution for there are TX 20 atti
I feel like that would be pretty
mismatched and maybe you should upgrade
your core platform but you should know
that you will be suffering from some
bandwidth degradation or some
degradation and performance if you do
cut the bandwidth that as you can see if
you go down to buy for your actually
dropping off a good 9 percent in
performance whereas from 3 from by 16 2
by 8 it's about 3 percent 2560 by 1440
it's about a 2 percent difference and
then at 4k it's also about a two percent
difference so was that about the same as
that we saw with the the 10 series I
think so it's more or less the same
right I didn't like I think a couple
other sandwich points and all of a
direct comparison article to look at
compared to this but in my experience in
the past this is roughly what we have
seen before
yeah you know
you know who says it really doesn't
matter what slot you put your graphics
card into who's who says that
The Verge The Verge says that and
they're how to build guide they say it
doesn't matter it doesn't matter but I
put it in the top slot because it looked
the nicest okay I'll I'll frequently
tell people you can put it in the second
slot you can put it in the by 8 slot and
your you'll lose a little bit of
performance but I mean to percents how
how important how important is that to
you it was for some people that's a big
deal you paid for it for other people
it's 2% and I mean people go apeshit
over a 3% in performance from
overclocking that's true it's very true
so it requires effort but that's that's
why I like articles like that that go
and test it so you can verify it
verifiably say fair client verifiably
that's an urban dictionary where I
guarantee I guarantee that's already in
urban dictionary
yeah ok straw poll for the r-tx 2070
stuff let's see what the results are
most people half half of you were just
never interested heap there are 35
percent of people though that's a pretty
significant chunk who say they were
interested but now they're not so they
were so disappointed by the launch of
the 2080 and 20 atti
or probably the relative price to
performance I would imagine because if
the 2070 is on par with a 1080 you can
get a 1080 for yeah it's maybe low 400s
mid to low 400s right now that's what
you're paying for 2080
and you're talking 600 yeah for the for
the 2070 starting yeah I keep mixing up
the numbers bit and I'm sure now that
the r-tx 2080 and 20 atti are out and
the reviews are out and you've given the
survey after launch
I feel like had you given this survey
before launch well it it a little
difficult but I feel like a lot of
people were probably interested in the
2070 but now that the reviews out they
still voted no I never was like I knew I
knew I knew all along I knew along
people who are super interested in the
new techno
she liked PC gaming who when they saw
the three cards at lunch for like hey
those top two are probably out of my
range but you know the 1070 like the
1070 has been a good bang for the buck
card for quite a while because it's not
grossly overpriced right so the 2070 you
feel like should fall into that slot -
yeah but now it's more of it's just it's
it's it's it's tiered up to the point
where it's it's comparing with other
cards that is out of a lot of people's
range I think yeah anyway yeah and
especially again when the 1080s 10 70s
and 1070 T is are so well priced right
now by comparison have you seen smiles
in Vegas have you seen some of the deals
that Greg Science studio has been
posting about used graphics cards it
says the used market you can let's get
whatever the Elliott 1074 like 220 bucks
don't quote me on that but it was like
really really it's like a steal a total
steal Nikki posted a video on it too but
I'm not sure anyway yeah you could buy
used yeah used I just I did point out
that you met idea tential and and my
video earlier today but you know it the
used market is there's always there's
always that risk there's always a little
bit of risk there so um you know it's
just something that you have to be aware
of going into it if you're gonna make
that call but yeah you can get some
insane some insane deals but guys that's
all for my half of the show when it
comes to the news segment so it is we're
gonna shut this down and we're gonna
switch over to Kyle's half and then a
little bit we'll do an after-party are
you doing with your toes trying to see
if I could put my foot into the frame
but I couldn't no legs t-shirt yeah if
you enjoyed this video then hit the
thumbs up button and thank you so much
for watching and again join us for the
after party if you're not already
watching on twitch twitch TV / awesome
hardware or click the link in the
description to jump over to Kyle's half
of the show yep thanks guys
I'll be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
