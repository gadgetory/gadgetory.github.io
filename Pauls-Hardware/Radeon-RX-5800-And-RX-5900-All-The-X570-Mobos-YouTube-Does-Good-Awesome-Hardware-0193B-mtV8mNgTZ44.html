sound it's a good sound it's probably
one of my favorite sounds yep hello
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
this is a show about technology we
stream every Tuesday evening at 5:30
5:30 p.m. Pacific Time twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware we also stream to our
YouTube channels this is episode number
193 and we already stream the first half
of it - Kyle's channel that's linked in
the description if you missed it if
you're watching us live thank you very
much for joining us Jeff Cheers and we
do drink alcohol in this show feel free
to join us please this is not motor oil
please drink responsibly
right now we're enjoying a peanut butter
milk stuff from belching beaver the
belching beaver brewery so good which is
quite tasty a word of warning we do
occasionally use adult language on the
show so watch out for that and we have a
bit of tech news to talk about to start
off and then we're gonna play some games
and answer some questions and we'll give
shout outs well we'll yell Johnson for
for mysterious reasons that aren't fully
understood even to this day yet whoever
happens to buy stuff from our stores
during the show because that's a great
way to support us if you like the
content that we produce my stories
Paul's hardware dotnet look at all this
stuff
we're all stuffing goodbye mugs hoodies
shirts that's that's real good real good
it's getting my job very good things if
you wanna buy stuff from Kyle go to bit
wit tech slash store or just bit with
that tech right yeah yep
and you can buy stuff there too it all
comes from the same place feel for you
to order from both stores and get
shipped together you get a bit of a
shipping refund and if you're buying
awesome hardware merch such as this RGB
everything gaming mouse pad feel free to
order from either store we both profit
either way that's great it's a great
system
okay today thousand you knocked it out
of the park beginning in the show handle
it Haylee efficient
let's do choosing it cheers Cheers
thanks for joining us yeah okay
delicious what do we got quite delicious
what's up what's on the agenda
huh a bit more tech news if we seem a
little fatigued it's because this past
week was just a blinding mess of running
benchmarks over and over and over again
there were three yeah three absolutely
major huge launches last week starting
with in videos super cards the Archie X
2060 super in 2070 super also the
promise of the 2080 super which I
thought they were gonna launch today
wait no yeah I thought they were gonna
lunch today but then nothing came of
that so I don't really I don't deal is
they hold now well see what happens
they're working on the super super but
yeah so and then on Sunday the double
launch of the AMD Radeon 3000 series of
processors based on Zen to those those
are real nice and also Navi based
graphics cards that AMD has also been
working on for some time all based on
Sanatana meter manufacturing process and
I thought I'd follow up with like well
what's next now right because every time
something new launches immediately like
well what's next yes because there's
always stuff playing in the pipeline and
this story actually kind of slipped
through this is actually almost two
weeks old now back from June 26 but
there was some news here about the RX
5800 and rx 5900 Navi GPUs these have
been documented in trademark filings
nice often some of the earliest news you
hear about new stuff is because they
have to file for names for the products
and so on and so forth official business
stuff so people watch those types of
filings and can gather information from
that so the 50 750 700 XT or what our
already launched those were aimed at the
1440p experience
according to AMD these potential further
more powerful variants of Navi have
potentially not been confirmed by
Sapphire who has registered a bunch of
product names with the EEC or the
European Economic Community because they
got to do that to get ready this that
you're looking here at 50 looking at
here's 50 750 700 X T again but what
they did talk about was everything from
5500 series all the way up to a 50 900
series so potential lower end cards and
potential higher end cards 5500 series I
would imagine anything below 5700 would
probably be aimed at 1080 gaming more
entry level given that the 5700 is
starting at 350 dollars you know you
probably be looking at mid $200 range
cards replacing the rx 500 series yes
and then they could do with the Refresh
for that because you know rx 500 series
GCN was around for a long time as AMD's
the Radeon group's primary graphics
architecture but it has now been
supplanted followed up by our DNA so
people are gonna be more interested in
it interested in investing in those
cards so cool hopefully this is all true
and legit the Radeon rx 5950 XT was the
highest end card referred to which might
get some people kind of excited because
especially with the last-minute price
drops that AMD did with the 50 750 700
XT there they're pretty competitive like
it's a very interesting race they're in
the mid range and you know I like it
when there's not an easy answer for
somebody who's like hey I've got 400
bucks to spend on a graphics card what
should I get you can make a pretty
strong argument for the 5700 XT you can
make a pretty strong argument for you
know well the 2060 super is also
available available at that price
although performance might not be quite
as much yeah but you do get the
ray-tracing features anyway I think the
2070 super
needs to come down in price a little bit
I think if they cut that down to like
450 it would be really really really
good shielding
if that would place it kind of where I
feel like in the same ballpark range
when it comes to price and value as like
the 970 and the 1070 which were really
commonly recommended go to cards yeah so
Nvidia do that it's fine just just lower
the price a little bit
nobody nobody's gonna think less of you
they're just gonna be alright cool
they're being competitive and they're
offering us a better value for a money
they'll think more um yeah they won't
thank you so I hope your feet yeah what
they're gonna do is that all that part
of there it's like you get three free
games and a foot massage sign up for
that Jensen personally comes to your
doorstep you got a massage here's how to
make the sale he washes them with his
leather jacket alright also this would
lend a little bit more credence to the
rumor that's been going around for a
while that there is a other version of
Navi because the fifty seven hundred and
fifty seven hundred xtr based on Navi 10
there is a rumored Navi 20 bigger chip
version that that hopefully we will see
come to market as well and you could see
you know 850 850 900 series cards being
based on something like that rumors and
recently have suggested that that might
arrive in the early half of 2020 so we
do still have a bit of time but you know
for now you got to deal with the 5700
cards or it could all be poppycock
because as as we discussed on Cal's half
of the show these are rumors it's leaked
information it's stuff the people dug
out of wherever they can find it and it
doesn't always pan out that way but it
seems reasonably legit to me yeah the
the Intel stuff that we talked about on
cows half seemed like a bit more of a
stretch this seems pretty in line with
what was what we'd expect from for me
but of course we have no idea when this
stuff might actually come out early 2020
seems reasonable what I'm worried about
is that by the time that comes out
Nvidia will have launched a new
generation of GPUs that just kind of
validates these ones well it is an
interesting question to see what Nvidia
is planning to do when it comes to to
shrinking down the process no because
they're still working on 14 nanometer
stuff mm-hmm
and you know they've got to do their get
they're gonna need to to to move down
they're gonna need to move down to
something like seven nanometer or
something like that and I feel like
there's already been a bit of rumors and
stuff about what they're working on
there but I don't have that in my brain
right now so I'm gonna stop talking
about it let's let's move on all right
x5 7008 X 570 no not X 570 risin nine
3900 X not on X 570 right cuz all the
3900 X reviews mostly we're on X 570
because those were the board's that went
out and everything but the 3000 series
of CPUs are backwards compatible with a
400 series and 300 series motherboards
so tech power up went ahead and dropped
a 3900 X 12 core $500 processor into a
$70 motherboard nice yeah the mother
that was gonna happen
yeah they quick like right after launch
someone would do that and Asus prime be
350 plus to be specific 70 bucks this is
a very bare minimum motherboard it is
targeted at gaming I cafes and light
offices usage so not even the type of
motherboard they're like hey if you're a
budget gamer they're like no no if
you're a commodity system need in need
of systems and you want to build them
for as little as possible and have them
get the job done that's what this board
is made for this will boot but we
promise it'll boot yeah it won't promise
much else but it does have a BIOS
version 5007 which was released on July
1st which does list support for the 12
core so they dropped it in
quick aside here and it blew up there
are a lot of be 350 and be 450 and
motherboards that do have BIOS updates
for rise in 3000 series you should still
go and check the CPU compatibility
support list because not all of them are
supporting in particular the higher core
count versions certain motherboards were
designed in specifics like I think max
out at like 65 watt TDP chips so some of
those might not have support for the
higher core count ones and some just
inexplicably don't even though it seems
like they did but you know hopefully
wherever there are gaps in support that
will be updated at least where possible
when it comes to the board itself some
boards just physically can't do it so
there we go
I think that's also saying that Greg
from science studio did this test yes I
haven't watched that video yet but I saw
his post the that too and I also did not
watch his specific video but yeah I
assume he got the same results which is
that they're the same I said it worked
yeah it worked yeah ok good because his
thumbnail for his video that I did see
seemed to indicate that he might have
had some issues but I'm not sure that
was just a thumbnail or what roit yeah
he did alright so cool and that's a
that's to be expected so if the board
supports the processor and you can drop
it in with no claims to overclocking
support it should function and if you're
running it at stock that should be just
fine um there are a few caveats
for example they ran their tests both
was an air cooler and a water cooler and
they did here's their specific setup
this articles linked in the description
by the way if you guys want to check it
out further prime B through 50 plus they
had a Noctua Nhu 12s air cooler as well
as a 240 millimeter ASA Tech all in one
note here looking at the results the
blue here is air cooler the green is
water cooling by and large they're
pretty much on par with each other
excuse me there are a few specific CPU
intensive tests blender and corona here
in particular key shot photogrammetry
where the number
dips for the water cooling setup and
that is specifically because power
delivery on cheaper motherboards is
cheaper if you have fewer power phases
or if you have power phases that aren't
rated for as much power delivery the
higher amperage then those will be
stressed out more they will get hotter
so if you have a water cooler on there
it's not moving any air over the VRMs
whereas if you have an air cooler it is
so in that situation the air cooler is
actually a better choice interests so
something something to keep in mind
there if you do have you know if you
built the system a couple years ago or
if you have a lower end 400 or 300
series motherboard and you're
considering a CPU upgrade it's the
totally can that's a really really cool
thing about this platform it's something
that I have tried to mention many times
because it's something I think Intel
should be given a lot of shit for yeah
like well I've seen people comment like
Intel what a charged you and made you
buy new CPUs for each of these two the
last two rounds of upgrade yeah as
compared to AMD and what they did with
300 400 and 500 series right so yeah
that's cool was it I'm sorry what did it
say what type of air cooler it was was
it a top down and to not to uh n hu 12s
switch okay so that wasn't even that's
just like a standard like almost like a
hyper 212 designs like a standing cool
tower it's yeah it's not even Tower cool
I was thinking maybe it was a downward
firing one that would get a bit more
airflow yes of course it's firing ones
I'm sure it's still gonna circulate some
air of course yeah it's just about air
circulation around the socket yeah even
if it's not pushing it directly over the
the v-rooms or anything
was it an open air testbed or was it in
a case me all these questions Kyle well
I don't know our supply's software
they're not listing a case in their test
setup so okay I'm guessing so so maybe
the the liquid cooler would have been
fine had it actually been in the case
with good airflow potentially if if just
the tower standard one tower cooler like
that was enough to to cool down the VRM
significantly um then maybe having some
good case airflow it would be enough to
potentially yes that's something that
that could be tested further they did do
some the use of their flirt camera to
take some pictures of the VRMs and
different setups it got really hot I
think there's 130 almost 140 see each in
specific situations they were they were
messing around trying different voltages
and stuff like that is this correct
usage of thermal it depends on the
surface reflectivity of the of what
you're pointing it at which I think for
this oh yeah way does it so the
reflectivity like in terms of like like
like a mirror a mirror would be the
worst possible thing to point to point
okay okay yeah yeah yeah like so like
anything like something that's chrome
and pointing it right in the middle of a
supercard yeah that'd be horrible
you'd be measuring the you'd be
measuring the temperature of the walls
reflected and so yeah shiny shiny nice
to be super scientific all right so yeah
good I mean that that's good it's good
information for anyone who might
potentially want to upgrade it's good
that you know that these boards are
accepting these new processors and
working just fine yeah and achieving the
same benchmark results as somebody who's
getting you know 200 300 bucks plus
who's spending 200 300 bucks plus 9 X
570 motherboard yeah so they but
speaking of X 570 motherboards look at
it look at all these you know 70
motherboards oh my god
an antique has an article where they
have some level of detail on literally
over 35 motherboards look at this damn
with this scroll down here they just all
they didn't test them all they did they
analyzed them also as far as features
and all that kind of thing so if you're
considering X 570 you should consider
the pros and cons I think they're pretty
straightforward the pros for X 570 are
this right here PCI Express Gen 4 and
maybe you need that maybe you really do
some heavy
read and write intensive stuff on
external nvme yes they're not extra nvme
SSDs you need really fast storage there
are people who are excited who are very
excited about this and they should be
and they should go for that and that's a
reason to invest in x5 70 you also get a
few more USB 3 ports that their point
one that's a lot more sr USB 3.1 gen2
I'm starting to see 3.2 listings and
it's so confusing oh god they're like we
have 3.2 gen 1.2 Jim one that's 3.0 yeah
step 3 put freaking out I was looking at
an asus list thing it was like 3.2 Gen 1
I was like that looks like the old front
panel it is the old front panel they
just changed the freaking name just I
hated the negatives 2 X 570 our price
the boards are more expensive the second
is that chipset TDP 11 watts
significantly higher than X 470 and X
370 or the B chips as well which means
almost all the boards have active
cooling on them to some extent
it is a cool i/o chip you do get lots of
Io from it and everything so I mean
that's kind of nice but active cooling
on chipsets has been the bane of many
many motherboards in the past if you go
back to X 58 I had a x58 motherboard
with the active cooling fan on it it's
just they're so tiny I talked to some
motherboard vendors who like no we put
good ones on there like they're nicer or
whatever they're still they they make
more they make noise and they're just
notorious for for failing early on or
starting to rattle or wine or whatever
whatever so that that's kind of
disappointing yeah
there you gotta get over that if you
want the PCI Express Gen 4 though it's a
full list isn't this an tech article if
you want to see it they have listed
prices where available and again like I
said 35 motherboards from vendors
including whoo gigabyte Asus Rock MSI
biostar and colorful so you might notice
for example here's all the asrock boards
and there are some like entry-level X
570 boards they have a gaming for 455
bucks
they've got a X 570 Pro 4 for $170 yeah
that's not bad and then you get these
really expensive ones that are 300 350
or whatever asus rog crossed her 8th
formula $700
everyone's like god like is like 700 -
yeah the god like so they all right so
all the month at all the the big three
have $700 motherboards the x5 70 horas
extreme really is a $700 board that's
crazy Wow and the Expo Center you got
like also 700 bucks but crazy when it
scales all the way from like the mid
hundreds like you know 150 170 dollars
and all these vendors have do have an
entry-level board kind of curious to
like compare those and say alright what
are the cheapo X 570 boards yeah what do
you what are you giving up what's a
cheap X 570 board compared to a high-end
p450 board or even be 350 yeah or even
or even X 370 or X 470 now like that's
one thing I've seen some people say is
like Oh check out the sex for 70 boards
because all those boards are gonna get
phased out yeah so you might see some
good deals on them as as certain
retailers start to try to clear out
inventory and stuff yeah and that might
be worth looking into because they're
gonna have better power delivery and
they might have higher-end features like
you know surface mounted mounted power
and reset buttons yeah external clear
CMOS stuff and fancier RGB LEDs yep
all that goodness alright but there you
go
just rehashing a little bit of that
stuff the only thing we didn't really
talk about was the that a G so that BIOS
update thing oh right which I only
really kind of caught earlier today that
it was even a thing but I wanted to
address it briefly in case anyone was
wondering who if you watched my rise in
3000 series video and you're wondering I
did mention it I don't think I'm not
sure if I put it in the hardware setup
but I actually used the more recent
version I was using the x5 70 or s
master board $700 board
Wow and I did update to the f-5e BIOS
because I ran actually most of my tests
within about sorry the master is not
seven it's the extreme that's it's 700
oh the extreme masters still like 305
masters okay but yeah I don't know the
extreme is everybody perfectly
reasonable to do motherboards that I put
on the board and shit poor people
motherboard garbage anyway I used that
5e uh-huh which did have the new the
newer edge ISA microcode update and
everything so so you don't to read run
benchmarks I don't have to rig your
height benchmarks thank god I think I
used MSI released a new bios after I
started testing my Rison 3000 chips but
I'm not gonna retest anything okay I
will be doing more testing with resin
3000 what am I gonna rerun all the same
benchmarks already did actually Steve
did that didn't you say and he did a
video on it and stuff and found that
there was probably like there's like a
super marginal difference yeah and a 1%
yeah it's very very minute if that you
know all right god bless him excuse me
all right one more star to talk about
here before we play some games dokie
YouTube is making it easier for creators
hey that's us hey to Z lies to me with
copyright claims I care about this topic
copyright claims really suck oh thank
god on YouTube tell me more coincidence
or no VidCon starts tomorrow you go to
VidCon cow no okay
this dick con starts tomorrow this
announcement was made today so I guess
they wanted to some goodwill for people
who've it probably not really I don't
know maybe it is related who knows Hey
but being if you guys aren't aware
YouTube has a system called Content ID
it goes through and it basically looks
at every video that's uploaded to
YouTube and it sees whether any of the
content in that video matches previously
uploaded content per content that's
owned by somebody else you can access
Content ID as a as a what's what's the
word I'm looking for you can access
Content ID as a creator to claim other
people who might have
your contents at a certain point I don't
exactly know what that is it's a certain
number of subscribers or something like
that so I for example could go and use
Content ID to flag any one who had
uploaded a video that contains parts of
my video or the whole video or something
yeah I've messed with it here and there
but what's really frustrating is when
you're a content creator and suddenly
you get a bunch of emails that say hey
this video was flagged this video was
flagged this video is flagged because
you as a user of Content ID can flag a
bunch of videos the people who get their
videos flags have to go in and dispute
each one individually yep and it's an
annoying process and everything haribol
beyond that there are the automated
claims that go through the system and
there are also manual claims and manual
claims have often been used in lots of
scenarios that I've seen maliciously by
certain companies trying to prevent
content from from staying on the website
or going and just trying to steal the
revenue because once you claim
somebody's video you can you can have
the video no longer viewable or you can
just be like all that videos ad revenue
now goes to me rather than than the
person who uploaded it so on to this and
the changes that they are making new for
content creators manual Content ID
claims will now have to specify exactly
what part of a video is infringing so
you can't just go and be like hey a
drive claimed your video for this song
now they have to they have to tell you
exactly the the part of the video where
they're saying you you supposedly used
their owned content so it just makes it
more yes I spend there's more effort on
the person claiming it yes invest and
that that in and of itself is important
because it's gonna stop people from just
masse claiming a bunch of videos because
they're gonna have to go in and specify
the timestamps the quote specifically
from the YouTube creator vlog a creator
blog is starting today we were we were
require copyright owners to provide
timestamps to indicate exactly where
their content appears in videos they
manually
and we're improving our video editing
tools in creator studio to make it
easier for creators to remove the
content associated with those claims so
if you have a video claims it's gonna as
a crew as somebody who posted the video
and you get a thing this is hey you used
somebody else's content you're gonna
very easily be able to go in see we're
in the video they claimed it and then
they're gonna direct you to tools built
in tools to easily mute the section of
the video or cut it out or replace the
audio so that's that's good
also manual claims prior to now required
manual clearance of the claim even if
the content reserved was removed but if
you go and use the tool and just like
lift it out then the claim will now be
lifted automatically hmm so that's so
that's nice good good for creators and
bad for people who have been attempting
to use this system to falsely claim
stuff unfortunately this new process is
not retroactive so it doesn't apply to
existing manual claims but yeah if if
you want proof that this is a good thing
YouTube tweeted about it this is
actually how I spotted it earlier today
and they also followed up and said
failing to provide accurate data is
considered a violation of our manual
claiming guidelines so claimants who
repeatedly do this will have their
access to manual claiming revoked now
you talk about punishing people who
misuse the system good which I hope they
follow up on and the twitter response at
least from what I saw and what Wes
Finland who wrote this article on PC
gamer saw has been positive if you ever
look at any response to YouTube creators
tweet it seems rare that they get a lot
of positivity there's some some usually
in there but for it to be majority
positive it's definitely different is
there any mention of them changing how
they handle people who strike channels
and abuse the the fair use system for
any channels who get wrongfully striked
that was not specifically mentioned as
far as I can tell but
I don't know I mean it does seem like
they're Wheldon they're trying to make
some effort um from are on our side
versus content strikers or whatever I
hope that Zen works - yeah me too it's
being strikes it's very debilitating it
is sucks I'm scary let me imagine me -
okay that's it for the regular news I'm
gonna eat a cookie mm-hmm
it seems slightly darkest cuz there's
malted milk in there it's a melted milk
mm-hmm that multiplex oh it's very good
I'm gonna have connect pad for cookie no
why not yeah a whole one I already had -
oh really stop peeing on my cookies well
you were talking a lot eating
it's hot again we're comin later there
we go okay
now now what there's the time in the
show
it wouldn't often we would switch over
to an after-party mm-hmm we're just
gonna keep it goin on my on this for now
because it's fun yeah we're gonna answer
some questions you guys have been asking
yeah and we might play a game in here Oh
who's a very good cookies oh shit Eric
guess you can have one but what happened
my wife reminded me that I'm not
supposed to be eating sugar right now oh
really she's doing like a no sugar
challenge for the month and I told her
I'd join her but we've been really bad
about it because we're order something
at like a restaurant not knowing that it
has something with sugar in it there's
added sugar like we can still eat fruit
and shit but yeah we've been failing
like left and right so I think she's
just calling me out in chat because
she's jealous that I'm eating cookies
sounds like it was her idea to not eat
sugar I don't see why you should have to
follow that do ya you know because she's
doing it with her friends and stuff for
friends like hey it's old it's nutty
sugar I was like yeah it sounds cool but
now I'm just like these cookies are
amazing and my other half let's no let's
eat this other half of the cookie
no I already touched it yes and who
knows where my hands have been they're
disgusting it'd be rude of me to not
finish it love you honey all right so
where we doing now um questions Hamish
alright
of safe
and my wife doesn't love me anymore Wow
no I'm surprised you love me in the
first place so this isn't really hard to
accept we are we had 144 yes we are 144
Hertz here of course we are no I don't
wanna do that
pardon 44 Hertz master race hey your
guys an octopus that's the new skin
that's available for what's his dude
Joe neck it's a Joe Nelson yeah Joe neck
I thought his name was something
different Joe neck is a player in the
overwatch League oh this is his special
skin yeah he I forget what he did that
made him is really good so Jim yeah
every I don't know the details around it
just like some really good player
inspired skin yeah I figure why is an
octopus maybe that's like a sketch that
is described each Apple no hmm all right
well while you're loading that up let's
go over some questions here well he won
MVP Thank You Johnny people to a knack
won MVP of like the game MVP it over
watch the I think oh you should watch
over look over websley is very fun I
guess I should bless questions at
Quinn's star beat $5 and I still have a
second Chennai 3 switching to rise in
second-gen enjoy some money well thank
you
rising 2nd gen is still a very strong
value proposition yes it is and actually
there's a lot of sales going on present
2-step point rappers n plus I'm sure
there's a lot of sales that's up yeah um
they've all to six feet $10 appreciate
all the work you and Paul been doing
here to keep us all updated keep up the
great work guys
thanks biggle or it's by gal totally
different if it's by gal that could mean
something
yeah anyway thank you very much for the
donation NB 67 $30 37 cents cheers Cal
thank you Mike
you are the real MVP is always
appreciated
Kenneth coral $15 what do you think the
chances are that they come out with a
new naming convention besides core i
three five seven nine when they start
moving closer to 7 nanometre assuming
they do I don't think they have any
reason to change that I think the core
i-x SKUs make sense people are familiar
with it it's you know got a good
reputation for the most part it's the
numbers following that they have to be
careful about in framedrops the hell you
dropping dropping like it's hot yeah
that's weird the hell I don't know it's
lagging Bros that's what this with chat
saying maybe it's the high refresh rate
you think we are at 160 FPS or something
oh geez huh
well that shouldn't matter on the stream
side if you're streaming out at 1080 60
what's your bitrate I don't know default
fault oh god I need to help my team okay
well hopefully the audio is not lacking
as long as you can hear us it's fine
just close your eyes otherwise you'll
get motion sick
Kenneth poor old $15 what do you think
the chances are that they come out oh I
already read that one yeah I think
they're gonna change the naming scheme
it's probably gonna be the same Alex W
Mickelson mitchellson
100 Norwegian kroner all up your G n mod
matte review bought something else
instead not that crap haha good when
will you do a review of the GN tools
oh well as soon as Steve stems me the
son for free of course stop shooting me
sure give tools now that's fun yeah he
did a tool kit or something like that
that's cool
does Jones $20 been a minute guys how's
your summer going so far I got a 3900 X
and an X 570 Taichi on the way we'll be
pairing it with 36 hundred megahertz ram
into the new corsair and p600 nvme
gen4 SSDs sounds like a pretty badass
system des Jones it does I I would
totally rock that as my main I agree
hell yeah dual into the median for SSDs
not bad
all right Stephen gar and mom garam up
5-3 bitch pounds longtime fan forgiveth
first live just wanted to say thanks to
Lyle after using BBC into this video now
I now see the BBC British broadcast
company differently well I use BBC Lyle
he referred to the the dark rock Pro for
as the as a BBC oh yeah big black cooler
ah
and I guess that brilliant sort of
resounded with some people you know he
has a certain way of speaking yeah yeah
I mean but BBC is you know there's a
number of acronyms it's used in a number
of ways
Hey British broadcast company is one
gotta appreciate the BBC there's there's
some others anyway
NB 67 $13 37 cents hey mo all cheers
Paul by the mighty coverage of the
product launches from both even cut
thank you thank you very much a I hope
we both spent lots of time on it if you
learn things you learn things hope you
didn't really chop you guys I'm sorry
but that just tell me the message as
soon as Paul finished in this round
maybe we can look into why flagon yeah
if there's any more time when I beta my
teammates Carly Adam $5 really be
reviewing the remainder of pin my PC
entries on this stream
there is no remainder and pick my PC
entries I we looked at all the ones that
I selected from Twitter there no there's
no way to get chunk grant blows up FD
Killam oh yeah there was no way that I
could have gone over all 285 submissions
that we had for putting my PC today so
instead we did five that's a reasonable
amount you could try it next week if we
do pin my PC you next week
yeah give me key gamer or Jimmy key
gimmi gimmi gimmi gimmi gimmi gimmi
gimmi a gamer 699 Canadiens I hear
you're looking back there hero oh he's
just having a good time
he's a big liquor help best case for to
RTX kingpins with cooler for cpu
question mark make a build video
question mark for kingpin sli question
mark or advice suggestion question mark
how's your not dead um best case for two
king RTX kingpins probably twenty eighth
nineteen pins I would say one with very
high airflow get a large case with good
air a lot of fans and get a liquid area
cooler probably two forty at least
because the CPU you're probably pairing
with those are TX Kings is probably a
high-end CPU that gets warmer and you're
gonna be overclocking it and all that so
I know it's Kyle I probably won't make a
build video for that because I don't
have to RTX 2080 a king pins the unite
stuff
OOP old-timer Dave $10 what up old-timer
Dave I like your name have you heard
anything about YouTube trying to get rid
of the channels with less than 100 subs
no I haven't heard anything about and I
think but that sounds messed up
sometimes it takes you know it can take
people like a year to get a hundred subs
so yeah I don't know why and it's a lot
of work and just cuz you know thousands
of thought subs doesn't mean they
shouldn't get any said why would you not
be able to have a channel if you had 98
subs I don't get it that's bullshit if
it's true Jay Bell my dollars 300x can't
find anyone talking about it any info
will reviews becoming y'all rock I don't
currently have a thirteen hundred X I
feel like 3700 X is kind of like the
3800 GPU encoding or something oh oh
GPUs actually really high
usage right now huh interesting
um yeah I might do a video with the
3,800 acts I can't say it to be like a
full-blown interview I'm sure there are
gonna be more reviews coming out on that
soon I have the thirty six hundred and
thirty six hundred X ordered but stupid
new egg shifting them from oh no
shipping them from New Jersey oh yeah
sure
okay are we're lining up a arrayed yep
we've got a few more questions still ok
we need to do Johnston's - all right so
just update you guys lost lost that game
of overwatch not that you guys were
seeing it very well there's really
choppy I feel like it's not this hasn't
been that chopping the game lost you
before the game was you maybe I think
exploit is actually set up to use the
Nvidia encoder as what must have been
happening awesome because the CPU usage
was only it likes forty percent there
should be plenty of head room ooh it's a
69 50 X just 10 what GPU 16 m50x GPU Oh
GPUs 20 80 TI oh no 1080 TI still still
plenty yeah okay anyway I kind of want
to redo this system anyway alright are
we screaming - both yeah we should be
live - both okay sorry so sorry about
that guys we actually tripped a breaker
we did I have a much better electrical
system externally here in my house but
internally the wiring is still the same
as it was back in the day so we have too
much stuff going on on one breaker which
included the AC out here in the garage
as well as this whole rig and setup
fortunately the system didn't shut down
because it's on a UPS thank God yeah but
for some reason like the fridge and then
also the the home theater area out there
is also on the same breaker so yes is
for everything yep more UPS if I had a
UPS actually if I had the router and the
Gateway yeah plugged into the universal
stream would have the stream wouldn't
when
died so there's something yeah um I
guess I'm just gonna continue on with
some of the questions here we've got wit
witness what is K 20 Canadian I have a
crosshair 6 motherboard so excited to be
able to drop in a 3900 X you can stream
edit and play games at awesome in
variable very reasonable frame rates
very good time for PCs good luck you
good work you guys love both your
content thank you thank you it's a good
plan yeah there's a good time for PCs so
choice the Golden Age is back yeah hey
Zeus MIT's $10 with summer being here to
have any tips on preventing a PC from
becoming a furnace in a room no he's not
being an issue should I allow for more
airflow intake or exhaust more from the
PC so it's just you have to keep in mind
that you know your PC puts out of a
fixed amount of heat generally generally
speaking unless you're changing around
the clock speed settings right yeah I
mean like if you're gaming for X amount
of time it's gonna put out extra amount
of heat and that heat just feels hotter
in the summer cuz ambient temperatures
are higher and everything so um yes you
can always point a fan at your computer
if you want to push more air over it I
mean I think I think one of the best
things to consider is just a way to
exhaust the hot air like so if you have
you can point a fan to like push hot air
out a window or something like that like
yeah it's really what you kind of want
to do ya think of think of especially
like in you know the summer and stuff if
you don't have central a/c or something
like that then you kind of got to treat
your room like like it's a computer case
like had a good airflow circulation in
your room and that'll really help the
temperatures in your PC so yeah like
Paul said if you can exhaust some air
out of your window maybe have cooler
source of air in taking you know from
somewhere else you know there's like DIY
ACS that you can make out of styrofoam
boxes like styrofoam coolers where you
put dry ice in and we're just a bunch of
ice water and you have like a fan
blowing yeah there's there's a bunch of
a ideas out there
degrees Sean Darwin and Chet said to get
a dryer exhaust and hook it up to the
exhaust of your computer it's like like
one of those extended extendo tubes oh
yeah so that it directs the hot air from
the computer directly out a window or
something like that that could work to
say you can you can mess around with you
know don't be afraid to DIY stuff or get
out your cardboard and cut it into
pieces and you tape it together or
whatever in question whatever keeps you
comfortable mm-hmm Kenny smallman 50
sick SEK Swedish I don't know are five
1600 and the GTX 980 time for an upgrade
1080p 144 Hertz monitor Swedish Krona
Swedish Krona
there's yeah I guess it's time for an
upgrade from when I hit 144 Hertz then I
think you need yeah you need to upgrade
both 1600 for the 980 yeah it's not
gonna get you very close to that so some
more modern components faster CPU would
definitely do you some decent favors
there Panthro blasts off five rupees
it's just an AR I don't know hey Cal do
you think an air-cooled 3900 X would
work in the fan tech shift or shift X
maybe a 3,700 X um I think you could get
away with a 3900 X uh well let's see
it depends I forget what the actual
South African Rand Wow Rand that's a new
one just are you just got some Rand yeah
South African Rand noises could do
currency to hold the rainbow strong
currents lovely brand Durand Durand it's
my favorite bands Rand was a little
random alright let's see uh let's let's
what you racist comment early about the
rand people they always walk single file
to hide their number
the shift and the shift X and you
definitely have a bit more cooling in
the shift X because it's longer there's
a bit more breathing room available you
can fit an AI o inside of the ship deck
so why not go that round I would fit a
squeeze of 120 millimeter liquid rat in
there or a liquid a IO in there if you
were trying to cool at 12 core 24 thread
part in this mini ITX case an air cooler
wouldn't get you there that far because
I know the baha'i clearance in the ship
decks is very slim and it probably
wouldn't be enough to really cool the
3900 x effectively the 3700 X you might
have better luck with but you're not
gonna be able to like really push it
very far you know if you wanted to
overclock or anything like that so I
would suggest going a IO if you can if
you can't then obviously like I would
definitely try a 3700 X first and see
how that works out with like a
low-profile air cooler but I kind of
feel like anything less robust than the
included Wraith the Wraith prism RGB
cooler you might you might have a hard
time cooling that ship a lot of course
Frank 20 euro for beer sugar and diapers
and less lag I don't know if 20 euro can
fix all those things it can can buy all
those things but we're gonna try you
know every dollar the lags already been
fixed by stopping playing video games
true so and we already have sugar in the
cookies we already have beer so you just
you can put that 20 bucks towards
diapers good
we need him we need lots of day I'm not
potty trained yet Jay Bell $5 since
everything died while answering my
question I guess I should send more
money Oh No thank you thank you Frank by
the way our DJ wait what happened oh
sorry Jay oh yeah I guess I got cut off
in the middle of his uh middle of his
well I guess we kind of already answered
it there wasn't really much more to say
the 30 had 3800 x it's not a chip that
either of us have at the moment I don't
have any immediate plans to do a full
review of one but I guarantee there's
probably other reviewers out there who
were gonna do extensive testing still
8-quart right it's too late course so I
mean if you look at the 3,700 X
it's got a lower TDP and doesn't boost
quite as high at the box but they're
very comparable chips so look to the
3700 extra views and the 3800 X isn't
gonna be that far off it might might run
a little hotter might boost a little
further and get a few extra frames out
of the box but it's not gonna be that
much different
same same corn thread counts and all
that honestly I think the 3700 X is the
better bargain without even testing the
3100 X if the last two generation is a
verizon is is anything to follow just
like how the 1700 was a better value
than the 1800 x and the 2700 in a lot of
cases was a better buy than the 2700 X
we're gonna see a similar trend there I
think which is exactly why I think AMD
sent a lot of the reviewers of 3700 X
instead of a 3800 X because when you
talk about price to performance but that
seems to be the stronger buy unless
you're in an overclocking unless you're
on overclocking then things are a little
different because you want higher
out-of-the-box speeds next up we have
five dollars from just a Chinese
character I'm sorry I don't know what
that translates to it's Chinese
characters I'm sure your name is
beautiful in English the Giga Byte I put
it into Google and it comes up as Nico
Yazawa but I don't know if that's an
actual interesting thank you also
because of some animation oh maybe maybe
it's an anime character that they just
dumped in there had a no fake name the
gigabyte X 570 or extreme has a
passively cool chipset which made my
ex-wife 70 choice for me yes 700 bucks
though it is very expensive I mean
that's it that's quite a premium for a
passively cooled chipset if that's the
only thing you're buying it for yeah it
does have a bunch of features on it and
stuff too which if you're gonna use a
good majority of them then it might be
worth it to some people someone's gonna
buy it but you know I think 99.9% of
people don't need a $700 motherboard
even with all those features and before
you pull the trigger on that if you
haven't already maybe do some other wait
wait for some more tests to come out on
X 570 power consumption to find out how
vital is that the active cooling on that
anyway
you know or like just how does had a
hack your X 570 bored and like to do
your own cooling solution yeah
which are like are like some of the some
of the water block makers gonna start
making chipset water blocks for 4 X 570
so people hold water cool I mean as
rocky already has their aqua which has a
built in water block which is all part
of the same impart are the same loop
right there right cuz yeah I mean that's
obviously there with these really really
high-end motherboards they're expecting
some people to probably buy them and put
them into custom articled systems that
are really high-end and everything and
absolutely you wouldn't want to still
have a chipset fan on a system that
you're kiddin out with water cooling and
stuff like that so that'd be kind of
interesting to see yeah but hey money
grows on trees for you and it's falling
out of your butt by all means credit to
hyper Wolfe 1983 who also called that
out in chat right as we were to bring it
up to nice all right that's gonna do it
