check the link in the description to
check it out and help coolermaster
support STEM education programs what's
up guys welcome back to Pauls hardware
this is probing Paul my monthly Q&amp;amp;A
video where I answer questions that you
guys have proposed to me and the
questions typically come from last
month's video this is episode number 17
by the way in the last month with
episode number 16 and there you can see
the long history of curling pulse now
also as I'm showing you guys last
month's video I'm going to segue right
into the first question for this month's
video or a bit of a response because
last month the the first question that I
answered was this one right here about
what the best CPU and graphics card
setup would be for a family room 65-inch
4k TV build which I responded to and I
said X to 99 and an Intel 7740 x1 at the
new quad core CPUs which haven't been
very well-received and speaking of not
being very well received oh my god did I
get some negative flak for that
recommendation so here here's just like
just a small sampling of that I could
have kept going further but people
calling me shil and it's the most BS
ever and a really bad recommendation
people dislike in the video and all that
kind of stuff which you know I'm gonna
cop to like totally warranted to some
extent I mean it really depends on how
you look at that original question he
was asking for what the best was and the
best at the time our previous to ask I
like X and K be like X launching would
be a 7700 K when it comes to all-around
GPU performance for CPU you're never
going to get more performance out of a
graphics card than you will to 7700 K at
whatever resolution you happen to be
playing at now you could say yeah when
you're playing at 4k it doesn't really
matter that the load goes over to the
seat or the GPU rather than the CPU and
that's certainly viable as well from my
perspective I was really looking at this
as answering the question what is the
best possible CPU and GPU configure
and that I can get what will get the
most out of that GPU in any situation
and I was like well if a 7700 K is the
best then what's coming out right now is
the 777 40k which can overclock to five
point one to five point two gigahertz
whereas the 7700 K would usually top out
it may be four point eight to five a
little bit higher frequency should give
you just slightly more GP performance in
games that are otherwise CPU
bottlenecked so that's why I recommended
it it was a completely out my
recommendation only for a very specific
niche scenario and again I understand
any of you guys who are slightly
disappointed with that recommendation
especially now that it's a month later
and there's a little bit more
information that has come out there's
been a ton more testing that has gone on
with both the KB Lake X and skylake X
CPUs in the past month
and I want to really quickly highlight
Hardware unboxed because I managed to
get a chance to meet Steve in person it
was a probably a poor screencap of Steve
there but got to meet him a person at
Computex he's a really nice guy and they
do really good testing over there and I
will fully admit that they've done way
more and way better testing than I have
in the past month for sure and if
anyone's called me she'll just like look
at my coverage of this X 299 launch
compare it to say the X 99 launch and
how many videos I did for that and you
can probably get at least some idea of
the fact that I've I've been less
enthused about this platform as well now
if you jump up to actual gaming
performance here he is showing and these
are stock benchmarks why that by the way
not including overclocking but the 7700
K when it comes to pure gaming he is
testing at 1080 as well by the way still
seems to beat the 77 40 K in a lot of
situations he also just recently tested
the 7800 X testing six core skylake X
versus 7700 K so I'll put links to both
of these in the description if you guys
want to check them out 7700 K continues
to win in case you're wondering so all
this is to say that my decision right
now to recommend that CPU was probably
not the best one certainly not the best
price to performance that that's really
not what I was going for but now that
we're seeing that the 7700 K is even
outperforming it in some situations it
makes it even less of a viable
option if it was a viable option to
begin with it all in the first place so
yeah if you guys want my honest opinion
about recommendations for gaming pcs and
otherwise the next few questions should
hopefully set you straight as far as
what I'm actually recommending when it
comes to a more well-rounded question
like what's the best bang for your buck
what's the best all-around solution to
this not just what's the fastest thing
that I can possibly get let's move into
some questions for this week though
first one from WM 1989 hey Paul looking
to build a rather unique and specific
machine goals are a 4k TV and TV and
media center home network Nass and
remote processing server looking for a
system I can log on to remotely and run
all sorts of in memory using CPU and
CUDA analysis and python or even excel
so clock speed and multi-threaded
performance both matter do you think the
79 hundred K will fit the bill or am I
completely off-base am I missing
something less obvious that could
bottleneck these types of tasks well
when you talk about bottlenecking and
tasks that is extremely CPU intensive
like type n analysis or the really heavy
calculation heavy Excel work basically
it's going to use as many cores as many
threads or as possible it's going to max
out what the CPU is capable of so
bottleneck isn't exactly the word but
you'll be able to make use of whatever
you put in there I guess would be better
a better way to put that that said that
7900 K cost a thousand bucks
motherboards cost 250 bucks and up and
that's going to be very expensive
platform to get into I think a Rison
system would be a great solution for you
right here I would recommend the Rison 7
1700 that's going to give you the most
cores and the most threads for the least
amount of money on that platform you can
overclock it and get performance that's
right in line with a 1700 X or 1800 X
and your motherboards are going to cost
you know 150 to 200 bucks even less than
that if you go be 350 rather than the
premium you have to pay to get into the
LJ 2066 platform that Intel currently
has going with the X 299 chipset now you
should also hang out for just a few
minutes just a couple weeks probably and
take a look at what AMD does have in
line for thread Ripper because they've
just announced some more information
about that this article is also linked
in the description they've also
announced
pricing so thread Ripper is coming they
announce two models a 32 thread 16 core
version it's going to be $1,000 so
compare that at a thousand bucks to the
12 core the sir I see 10 core 20 thread
7900 X and then for 800 bucks you get 12
core 24 thread version of that and they
said that they are going to be shipping
CPUs and motherboards in early August
you can even do pre-order starting on
July 27th so that's pretty soon and for
your type of work that might be
something to take a look at that said
again if you want bang for your buck I
would say a risin 7 1700 would be a
great option for you it will do all
those things you want it to do and it
and it will do them well
next question from parse Mehta another
another builds question I'm it's like
I'm trying to redeem myself from last
month or something I'm trying to build a
streaming content creation and gaming
build for my processor should I go with
The Horizon 1700 X or an IEEE 777 40 X
should I get a 4k 60 Hertz monitor or
1440p hundred and forty-four Hertz
monitor well part I apologize if you
were misled at all by last month's video
if that's what you happen to watch but
for your purposes especially if you're
going to be streaming and doing content
creation absolutely the Rison 1700 X is
what you should go for even the 1700 you
as long as you're okay with overclocking
it would be a good option as well and
then as far as your monitor I'd say 1440
hundred forty-four Hertz panel if gaming
is your thing you're going to appreciate
that higher refresh rates and 1440 is a
lot easier to push with with a more
reasonably priced GPU so you won't
necessarily have to get like a 1080i or
something like that to get yourself up
and running it with that so those would
be my recommendations for you another
build question Wow this is last one
learning he's learning 3d modeling in
blender he's going to need a PC based on
a rise in 7 1700 should I buy the 1700
now or wait for Andy thread Ripper my
budget on the CPU is $350 well I hope
era
Yaroslav zinchenko by the way asked this
question I said he also plays computer
games he decided not to get the Intel
Core i7 because 16 toads are often
compared and rendering and you're
absolutely right there so
for sure 1700 is a great way to go and
if you were already watching the rest of
this video you saw some of those initial
prices for thread Ripper
they are pretty high it's a high-end
platform it's going to be costly that's
that's kind of the way it goes if it's
still putting the screws to Intel even
costing that much money I'd say it's in
a good position but since you're saying
your CPU budget is $350,000 processor
they're still really beautifully
especially if you're doing something
like blender something that can take
advantage of all those threads so go for
it
look look I just did three rise in
recommendations in a row I'm not I'm not
an I'm not an Intel shill
all right buy a GTX 1080 now or wait for
Vega ask cite Islam is upgrading an
aging 780ti here again I would say wait
for Vega and that's just because it's
only about two months off it's still a
big question what kind of competition
Vega is going to have for the 1080 when
it actually comes to gaming it looks
like Vega is going to be not quite as
powerful as people were hoping it would
be but we still don't know absolutely
for sure everything right now is mostly
based on the Vega Frontier Edition stuff
that's come out which isn't necessarily
your gaming specific card so yeah I just
say weights it should be coming out at
about the same time frame as that thread
Ripper stuff that we talked about so end
of July very beginning of August
SIGGRAPH at that event is when AMD is
going to be having some additional
announcements about those products next
question though from Padawan preacher
for folks like myself who are just now
possibly getting into video editing what
rendering or export settings do you use
to get a manageable file final file size
at 1080p while not sacrificing on
production quality what matters and what
doesn't well there's a lot of stuff that
goes into this as far as what resolution
and bitrate and everything that you're
recording at I will just focus on the
main thing that you asked which is going
to be about exporting so here's a W
Premiere CC this is a Arctic NASA -
teaser project that I did just recently
and whenever I go to exports away I got
to be choosing that window first so
whenever I go to export my media here's
here's how I kind of run down stuff I
basically have through to
resolutions that I might do 1920 by 1080
or 4k 3840 by 2160 I will usually save
presets for them so I can grab them from
the drop-down menu here I usually do
h.264 although I will probably be
switching to a CVC h.265 at some point
soon but YouTube processes h.264 really
well they have for quite some time now
paste of it
so once I've chosen the format up here I
just run down things here so if it's a
4k video 4k resolution put that in right
there frame rates I usually do if I'm
recording 24 frames per second at 4k
which I do pretty frequently the 4k I'll
just render it out at 4k if I'm doing
1920 by 1080 I usually do 60 frames per
second for beyond that I just do
progressive scan of course always square
pixels NTSC if you're in Europe or
whatever you can do
I'm sorry Europe and Asia he can do pal
profiles main level will change
depending on the resolution you do it
need to do a higher level if you go with
a higher resolution like 4k and then
bitrate down here I usually just do a
single pass variable bitrate and I
target 42 megabits per second for 4k if
I'm doing 1080 60 frames per second I
usually bring the bitrate down to about
25 and then for regular 1080 30 stuff
I'm usually fine at about 15 that's
pretty much what I wear I go to for 4k
again has been between 40 and 45 I was
in 45 for a while and actually I thought
Jay say he does 40 and then I started
doing let's just 42 it's right in the
middle I also usually choose maximum
render quality and that usually gets me
a really good quality that that still
looks pretty good after YouTube has
processed it but if you want that high
quality it's just going to take up a
little bit more space chances are all
right bird bamboo asks hey Paul I'm
planning on adding at 360 red to the
front of my case and buying some static
pressure fans should I use the static
pressure fans along with my stock fans
the ones the in the build they're the
ones I assumed that came with the case
and a push-pull configuration if so
where should the stock fans go and where
should the static pressure fans go so
two parts to this one is should you use
both of them it's a difficult question
to ask without knowing specifically the
specs of the fans that you're planning
to use static pressure fans you know
those are the ones that are
ideally meant to go right up against the
radiators radiator so obviously you're
fine with those I would say try with and
without adding your additional adding
your other fans but definitely if the
360 is an intake put the static pressure
fans on the intake side so the air fans
radiator and then the rest of your
system and then try the existing fans on
the inside of that radiator and
push-pull see what kind of change it
makes chances are it might help a little
bit but once you test how much power
it's drawing how much additional noise
it might make with those fans it may or
may not actually be worth it for you but
that definitely use of static pressure
fans is your intake so they'll be
pushing right up against that radiator
because that's where most of the
difficulty for air passing through is
and that's where you want the static
pressure fans to be doing the most one
last question from virus where beacon or
sausage I assume this means bacon or
sausage what he was talking about a
Grail shaped beacon but a very very
challenging question an eternal question
actually I brought have to go bacon
especially if it's well-done it's got to
be nice and crispy but I mean that's so
challenging because sausage covers such
a wide variety of the blended and spiced
meats shoved into on trails or whatever
they're actually packed in and those are
really good too I mean honestly they're
really really close for me it but I mean
if I got to choose one I got to go with
some crispy some crispy crispy bacon and
guys that's pretty much all I have for
the July episode of probing Paul thank
you so much for watching I hope it has
been at least somewhat enlightening for
you guys of course if you want to ask me
questions for next month leave those
questions in the comment section down
below and I will eventually get to
scrolling through those and answer them
in August's episode of probing Paul
thank you so much for watching as always
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you enjoyed it and we'll see you guys
