pulsar bird today's video I'm going to
be doing a tutorial on how to ship a
desktop computer because that is what I
need to do and I've done this actually
quite a few times before maybe you guys
have to but whether you need to ship
something to yourself if you're moving
or maybe you've done to pay it forward
build that you need to get from point A
to point B whether you need to ship to a
different state or across the country
there are a few basic best practices for
shipping a desktop computer so I'm going
to walk you through those today I'm also
of course going to be packing up my 500
thousand subscriber giveaway RGB system
back here at the same time so if you
already know all this stuff then maybe
you can still watch and get a few tips
if not then at least this is a reminder
to you guys that this system is still up
for grabs I'm packing it up right now
but the giveaway is still ongoing
it's open until Saturday so I'll post
again the link in the description if you
guys want to enter that and lucky winner
will be chosen within a couple days
after the giveaway period ends and then
I'm going to be shipping this in these
states that you will hopefully see it in
at the end of this video it's all that
said let's get right to it okay I've
just realized this doesn't look great
without the backlighting oh yeah that's
much better
okay so first things first since I have
used this system a little bit I have a
couple logins going on in it and stuff I
was using this to do a bit of live
streaming I do want to clear it out as
best as I can so my plan is to do a
secure ace on the SSD I do want to run a
backup on here first if you are handing
down a system or something like that you
obviously want to make sure that you get
anything off of it that you might need
beforehand so I got a couple folders
here and I plugged in an external drives
it's just hanging out right there this
is this is a very advanced technique
here I'm dragging and dropping there we
go and then the last thing of course is
I knew do need to activate Windows I
need to purchase a Windows license so
for all of these people who have asked
me hey Paul does the King Wednesday
thing still work
I haven't read in a couple months but
I'm going to try it again so let you
know the meantime I think I have
everything necessary copied so let's
jump into the UEFI and see if I can get
that secure race going
you vfi on a widescreen is it's really
wide okay cool
one of the things that Asus has been
just included as part of their UEFI and
their BIOS I don't know when they
started doing this but as a few years
back when SSDs became popular they
included a secure erase function that's
part of the UEFI that's a great way to
do it because it's pre-boot so you're
going to make sure it's completely
securely erased and then we have the
drives that are connected currently it's
just this just the SATA drive so I can't
use it on the dang it give me a second
Lee for your design so the reason I
wanted to do the secure race from the
UEFI is if I boot it onto the system off
of the SSD you can't secure erase that
drive when you've put it off of it into
Windows so fortunately I do have another
option from Toshiba since this is an OCD
Toshiba Drive they have a SSD utility I
will need to create a USB Drive to boot
from with the utility which they have
available boots through their downloads
page and then I can boot from that and
then hopefully secure erase the drive
press now I take our fancy new bootable
USB drives and it was plug it in rotary
and now we must boot from it okay it
didn't work the first time I'm thinking
maybe it's because I was in UEFI mode
let's do student on UEFI mode look safe
mode hot safe mode I like to live
dangerously
okay now I'm not in safe mode didn't do
much baby what happened keeps giving me
these ellipses and then my computer just
turns off okay like that
you know I feel like it's not supposed
to do that this time I am doing safe
mode damn you and it is what do you mean
what are you trying to tell me
success safe mode has gotten this to
boot into this utility environment
properly so that's good
got our SSD recognized there I've
learned apparently that it's only
connecting to a 2 by 8 Giga transfers
per second connection PCI gen3 by 2
instead of by 4 probably can update that
setting in the UEFI okay I've discovered
it and I promise I'm going to stop
pointing a camera at a computer screen
in a minute that's under maintenance and
then tools and then we have secured a
function right here and hit erase
confirm that all my data will be gone
and there goes ok that completed
successfully and I wanted to also point
out in case any of you guys are watching
this video and actually using it as a
tutorial and you're looking at this and
saying well Paul I have a hard drive
like mechanical one like this I'll be
honest my recommendation for most people
if you are passing on a system that has
a mechanical hard drive in it or you
just have McKenna mechanical hard drive
that has sensitive data
I do not hand these down to other people
I just take it out of the other out of
machine I keep it I keep all my hard
drives it's very difficult to
permanently erase data off of these
without completely destroying the disk
inside so I would definitely recommend
if you're passing down a system that has
a mechanical drive into it in it maybe
just consider just popping that drive
out and purchasing a new like just an
inexpensive SSD or a different
mechanical drive to install windows onto
and go about that route because I will
never tell you yes here is how you can
permanently delete all the data off of a
hard drive because it's really hard to
do all that said let's I'm going to get
windows installing back onto my Rd 400
on there and I can actually I think move
over to actually starting to pack this
thing up quick aside here since I
pointed out that my SSD wasn't in the
right configuration I have found that
here in the Vice end up to PCIe
bandwidth configuration set 2x2 and
bumping that 2x4 right now
and then I will save this in the
overclocking profile which I had saved
right here so whoever gets this can
easily just punch this in for 4.8
gigahertz overclock they see if you
might be able to go but beyond that too
but I'll leave that to whoever the lucky
winner might be and the meantime save
this here is 4.8 to give the profile to
let's just get that Windows installation
going any second there it goes and now
we can move on to everything else that
we need so to get my packing up done I
have some packing tape of course at a
box cutter right there and then probably
the most important thing for shipping a
computer is going to be the box that the
case came in this is a very good reason
to keep computer case boxes because
whereas I will usually get rid of all
the other boxes for a build the case box
I will try to hang on to this is also a
good reason why if you're doing like a
review of a case because cases and not
just the case which might cost like you
know 150 to you know down to 50 bucks or
so it needs to be kept safe by the box
but you might put an entire system in
there worth you know set thousand to
three thousand dollars and then the Box
now needs to keep all that stuff safe
too
that's why it's a good idea to make sure
we got at least decent quality internals
and fantex uses they don't use the
closed cell foam it's not quite as nice
but it's funny thick you got at least a
couple inches thickness on either side
else will still have a plastic to put
over the system to keep it nice and
clean in there especially with the
tempered glass pieces and then not only
do I have this box which is also double
boxed which is nice but I have this box
too thankfully this is a box from AMD
risin 5 stuff that just arrived because
I will be shipping 2 boxes system goes
in here without much else and then
everything else is going to go in here
everything else includes parts I'll be
removing which is the graphics card
mainly I guess mainly just a graphics
card but then all these other retail
boxes because if I'm shipping a full
system I'd like everyone to have as
close to the retail experience as they
can so here you can also get an idea if
you're not already aware of everything
that's inside so the retail box for the
7700 K box
that just recently so I wouldn't be
sending an engineering sample the crack
in X 62 of course keeping everything
nice and clean the g.skill trident z r
gb memory kits in there they have
thankfully already sent me a replacement
for this so I will not be going RGB
lists from the memory side of things max
miss 9 here oh of course and then the
GTX 1080 Strix Edition also from Asus I
have the accessory box for them to
evolve the chance of some kits in there
like the pump mount and some other
things that the winner might want to
hang on to if they decide to maybe
upgrade this to water cooling or
something in the future and then of
course the OC grd 400 box that also has
a riser card in it I mean not necessary
right now but you never know in the
future and then of course we have the
replacements sleeved cable kit for the
power supply and the power supply box
itself so winter is going to have plenty
of cables because they're not only going
to have the replacement kit here they're
going to have all the original cables
from the supernova 750 g2 as well so
basically here's the plan I'm going to
pull out
well once once Windows is installed
we'll get to that and we'll activate it
and everything as well but once that's
done I'm going to pull the graphics card
out because you never want to ship a
graphics card inside a system like this
it's just a really bad idea you want to
pull that out because basically you have
to assume that this system in this box
is going to be tossed it's going to be
tossed around it'll land on whatever
site it happens to land on so you're
going to have torque and just like
impacts going on that a hanging graphics
card there in the system might not
necessarily be able to withstand so
definitely pulling the GPU out is going
to tie extra cables just off to the side
so they can't be looser in there banging
around and stuff everything else should
be ok that's one of the nice thing about
closed-loop coolers looking coolers like
this and in fact a big reason why a lot
of the boutique manufacturers like
CyberPower and those kind of people
actually like installing these because
it's a lot easier to ship this the
radiator is much more secure and there's
not a bunch of weight on the CPU block
like you'd have with an air cooler so
you can ship it as is so the GPU is the
main thing I'm concerned about
everything else I should be able to
leave in there and just pack up the
accessories and then one final note
again for folks who might be shipping
a system that has a hard drive installed
I usually pull hard drives out as well
and put them in a separate box and ship
them separately if I can now that's not
a hundred percent you do have hard drive
mounted due to a pretty good job but
especially if you have mounts like this
one this one is actually not terrible
this is a fan text1 but did I believe
this is from the enthu Pro this is
plastic though it's a little flexible
and a drive sitting in a tray like that
can get bounced around in a system and
I've seen them come where the drive is
just completely topped off the rails and
the drive itself is hanging out it has
been banged around pretty badly and you
don't want that to happen within
Mechanical dress so I definitely
recommend if you are shipping a
mechanical drive pull it out of the
system pack it somewhere else separately
and keep it safe for the journey Windows
is all installed so that's good and next
I'm going to see if I can activate I'm
not going to show you guys this part
because I want to show you the key but
all these nuts let's see if it works
Windows is activated that's actually a
key that I purchased about a year ago to
like almost literally one year ago and
it still works so that's good well guys
it looks like the system is pretty much
all set up as far as what needs to be
done with the software windows updates
is all good to go when does is installed
I've installed nothing beyond basic
drivers windows updates and I did the
ORA software in the NZXT cam so I could
plug back in my spring time color scheme
which which I think looks lovely
especially right next to my Yosemite
Valley background and look no more
activation notice info in the corner so
I think I think this is like wrapping it
up I just I don't know I mean I guess
it's all left to do is say goodbye
Oh
there is guys my two packages are packed
up and ready for shipping all I need is
winter of course so if you guys still
haven't entered the giveaway is open
through Saturday so link is in the
description for that and all the details
for the giveaway whether you're in North
America or international or in my
original giveaway video and also
swingset as well so if you're watching
this video I hope you're at least
excited about the potential for the
giveaway if not maybe you've learned a
little bit about some of the nuances of
shipping a full desktop computer that's
completely built because there are a few
details that you should pay attention to
to avoid damage during shipping now I'm
gonna have a blank space here in the
corner so sometimes going to have to
build another computer to go there so
stay tuned for that and of course hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video thank you so much for watching
though guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
