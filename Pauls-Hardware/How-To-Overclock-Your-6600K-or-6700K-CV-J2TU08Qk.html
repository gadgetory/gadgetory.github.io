guys and welcome to my sky league
overclocking video a video that I am
doing because you guys requested it
that's right I also realized though that
if you have a skylake processor right
now that's an Intel 6th generation Core
processor which means you have a 6600 K
or 6700 KK's until went ahead and
launched the case q overclockable
processors first that means well you
have the overclockable processor with
the K on the end it means you don't have
a stock heatsink fan like this one
because intel didn't ship them with
these processors which means you
probably have something a little bit
better whether it's a nice all-in-one
liquid cooling unit like this Corsair H
110 or something else similar it means
you have the potential to get yourself
extra free performance just by following
a few basic overclocking steps that's
what this video is for we're going to
teach you the simple and easy way to go
for a 4.6 to 4.8 gigahertz overclock on
your CPU that's about what most of you
guys should expect with the case q
processors that lunch so far and really
all that you need beyond that is just
the proper hardware so let's take a look
at this test bed that I have
meticulously assembled for today's video
so at the heart of my test bed of course
is the 6700 K that I'm using you could
also use a 6600 K just make sure that a
K on the end because if this is the
future and Intel has released other
skylake CPUs the non k SKUs aren't
multiplied or unlocked and that's
important you're also going to need a
good CPU cooler i am using a corsair h
110 which is an all-in-one liquid cooler
you don't necessarily need to go this
high-end you can get by with something
like a cooler master hyper 212 plus for
example but if you want to keep the
temperatures down a little bit more and
all in one liquid coolers a great way to
go the motherboard i'm using is the
gigabyte z170 x gaming g1 which is a
actually really high-end motherboard
from gigabyte bear in mind the lower-end
motherboards might not overclock quite
as well in this series but you do need
the z170 chipset in order to overclock
if you don't have a case here your CPU
and the z170 chipset you will not be
able to do what I'm about
show you how to do so make sure that you
have that that's very important I also
have Corsair Vengeance LP X ddr4 memory
most motherboards in this range are
going to use ddr4 memory so you will
need that not gonna do memory
overclocking here but I'm going to plug
in the XMP values to set the memory to
its rated speed apart from all that you
will need the rest of the parts that you
would usually have in a computer which
would include like something like a case
power supply as well as some type of
storage or SSD and/or if you get
everything up and running then you're
probably also going to need an operating
system and I've gone ahead and already
installed Windows 8.1 on this so we can
move forward with the overclocking
procedures you also might want a
graphics card I'll be running a gtx
980ti for these tests although I've
removed it so you can get a better look
at that motherboard so we're starting
our overclocking journey here in the
operating system I'm actually not going
straight to the BIOS because as much as
we want to go ahead and jump in and
start doing our overclocking we have to
do some due diligence first that means
getting your operating system installed
I'm using Windows 8.1 in this case run
Windows Update and get it all up-to-date
and then also I'm going to download all
my drivers get those installed make sure
the system is pretty much good to go and
then up here in the top right you can
see I've downloaded some of my
monitoring programs so I have cpu-z
just to keep an eye on things you can
see the core speed there and then I like
hardware monitor as well which is also
from the CPU ID folks that lets us do a
few things for example it lets us keep
an eye on the overclock itself so
they've added the core clocks here and
you can see that they're peaking at 4.2
gigahertz right now because it is still
at the reference speed this will also
allow you to check on the temperatures
and this is something really important
to keep an eye on bear in mind that the
Intel CPUs can have a they have a TDP
max of 105 degrees Celsius so they can
get pretty hot but I generally like to
keep things below 90 or 95 if possible
apart from that you're going to want to
do some stability testing and also give
yourself something to compare against
once you actually do your overclock so I
have a few two benchmarks that I have
pulled up there's a bunch of different
types of benchmarks you can run this is
just the ones that I've chosen I have w
prime and I'm running the 1024 that down
I also have Cinebench r15 which is very
popular these are also all three by the
way set a bench basically does some ray
tracing and it creates this image here
all you
CPU and then also we have pov-ray which
is also a ray tracing utility so it uses
the cpu to do ray tracing calculations
there is a benchmark built into this one
that you can access from the render
drop-down and then also we have pass
mark which is a little bit of a lighter
weight but all around test so it does
cpu tests as well as the rest of the
system of course in this particular case
I'm mostly going to be focusing on cpu
tests so after you've gotten everything
installed everything up to date and
you've chosen your tests that you want
to run to get yourself a baseline and
you've run all those tests then we can
restart go into the BIOS and start our
overclocking adventures of course there
are you two utilities that you can use
to overclock from the operating system
but since those aren't Universal I'm
just going to show you guys how to do it
from within the BIOS or UEFI is it's
also known and to get there I'm just
going to restart and as the computer's
restarting or as its booting I'm going
to be tapping the delete button to enter
the BIOS system configuration I'm just
tapping the delete button pretty rapidly
as the system boots because systems tend
to be pretty fast these days we should
see the splash screen for the
motherboard and you'll notice down here
it says delete to enter BIOS once the
vows pops up so then we can start with
our overclocking now this is a gigabyte
which is a UEFI BIOS and it actually has
Mouse control and that kind of thing
that you can do and here on the front
page you'll see a lot of basic stuff so
you'll see your CPU frequency right out
of the gate you'll see your b c la v CL
k or base clock which is pretty much
always going to be a hundred megahertz
although you can't adjust that more on
that in a minute though and basically
we're just going to go straight forward
here we're going to be doing a
multiplier based overclock it's also
known as the ratio so i'm going to jump
down to advanced frequency settings and
we're going to go straight for a
multiplier overclock so here we can see
the base clock we're going to leave that
as is right now the idea here is to
pretty much leave everything in auto all
we want to change is the multiplier
which is also known as the ratio
sometimes so here's a cpu clock ratio
and we can just key in what we want or
we can hit the plus or minus button to
go upward
I'm just going to punch in 46 just like
that and that should give us as
reflected right here 4.6 gigahertz and
this was actually the first thing I did
when I first got the CPU and then I
rebooted and then I did a bunch of tests
to 4.6 gigahertz and I found yes it
worked actually quite stable II so bear
in mind here that the multiplier times
the base clock is what's going to give
you your frequency so as long as you
leave that base clock at 100 your math
will be really easy and if you go for 44
for example that's 4.4 gigahertz if you
go for 46 it's 4.6 gigahertz 48 is 4.8
and so on now that is basically it as
far as like the simplest type of
overclock we can get there's a couple
other things I want to point out here
that one is that you have profiles that
are available in pretty much every
modern UEFI and not just this gigabyte
one here so we can use this to save
profiles and this will allow us to for
example save that 4.6 gigahertz
overclock as is and then we can easily
jump back to it it's also a good idea
actually to come in here once you have
just the system up and running for the
first time with everything a default
maybe save a default profile as well but
we'll save that for point six profile
two and there's one other thing that you
might do when it comes to overclocking
and that's going to be for memory and
memory the easiest way to do it is just
to use the XMP profiles so here we can
just switch that to profile one like so
and then we automatically get our 26.67
multiplier for the memory which gives us
our memory speed of 20 667 which is what
it's rated for out of the box now
21:33 is the base frequency for memory
for skylake and you actually are only
guaranteed to get that speed some CPUs
might not be able to go higher
frequencies so if you are having
instability I'd recommend maybe pulling
that XMP profile off going back to 2133
and testing there just to make sure that
memory is not playing factory
instability last thing to point out is
that you want to save an exit and then
it will reset and boot back into the
operating system so I was able to boot
back up just fine and from here I would
go ahead and rerun all of those tests
make sure I'm stable everything but you
might be saying Paul you're giving us
like the best case scenario and
everything is working for you what what
do we do if like things go
wrong if you hang when you try to
restart or if you have instability or
even worst case scenario what if you
can't get back into the BIOS change
those settings that you just changed the
answer is going to be right over here at
least on this motherboard that's your
clear CMOS CMOS and by holding that
button down for about 10 seconds you can
clear the memory in your BIOS or your
UEFI that will reset everything back to
its base settings and then you can go
back in and start playing around again
and often that also will leave or retain
those profiles that you can save so
that's why saving the profiles is a good
idea because if you do have to clear the
CMOS it allow you to really quickly get
back in there let everything back up the
way you had it and continue on your
overclocking journey I'm going to jump
back into the bass here real quick just
to share a couple more things with you
so let's say you do what I just did and
you punch it in you're 4.6 in ear and
new tests and you're like hey
everything's working great I want to try
to go for a little bit more and here
actually can also see since I did the X
and pew profile they have the memory
it's also showing up right there but
beyond that you would I mean you'd
pretty much just do more the same which
would go back the frequency settings and
then go back to your clock ratio and
maybe bump that up you can even go to
into advanced settings for example and
if you're not doing the overall clock
ratio then you can actually do
individual by core so you can say well
if you're only using one core you can
overclock yourself higher your turbo
turbo boost a little bit higher so you
can adjust those settings so the most
popular thing to do to try to stabilize
a higher higher frequency overclock is
to add voltage so you can go to the
voltage control here the CPU voltage
you'll note here that the base is 1.2
volts
I've already keyed in 1.2 75 with us
with skylake processors you probably
want to stick between 1.2 and 1.27 by
volts if you can if you are overclocking
you want to add voltage I'd say one
point three two one point three seven
five is where you'd want to go if you're
going beyond that you can do that like
one point three seven five to one point
four to five for example just I would
only recommend doing that temporarily or
just like validate and overclock but
don't run at really high voltages for
long periods of time because it's it's
just not a good idea and that's a way
you can permanently damage your CPU is
running at higher voltages also when
you're running higher voltages you're
going to get more
higher temperatures so always keep an
eye on your temperatures as well there's
a couple of things you can do if you're
trying to stabilize an overclock the CPU
VCC IO and the system agent voltage
adding a little bit to those is a great
way to do that one last thing that I
would say you can play around with if
you're interested would be the base
clock or BC LK that's located right here
and this is something that's a change
for skylake because you can actually do
increments here so I could do like 101
for example and punch that in before you
could only do straps like 125 was
available and you can actually mess
around with this a lot chances are you
won't get too much more out of this
based on what you might have already
gotten just with the basic overclock but
it's a way you can sort of eke out a
little bit more performance by nudging
that base clock up a few megahertz so
after you set up your overclock you've
done some stability testing to make sure
everything's stable you're going to want
to rerun those tests each ran back at
the beginning to see what kind of
performance improvement you got from
your overclock to give you guys an
example here are my performance results
going from 4.2 gigahertz or the stock
frequency of a 6700 K up to a 4.6
gigahertz turbo
and there you have it guys if you want a
to long didn't read version and you
skipped to exactly this point in the
video I will tell you if you want to do
what I did just go into your BIOS set
your multiplier to 4.6 hit save and be
done with it because honestly that's the
first thing I did with this overclock
and that's all I was able to get out of
it despite all of my testing after that
that's still not a bad overclock at all
though and I have heard the people are
hitting 4.7 and 4.8 if you're
overclocking at home though just make
sure to monitor those temperatures don't
run too high the voltage and of course
you're assuming the risk of overclocking
the hardware which is not always covered
by the manufacturer's warranty remember
if you have a skylake case q processor
6600 KR 6700 k just just overclock it
even go for like four point four or four
point five I can pretty much guarantee
you'll be able to hit that without
adjusting anything else and it's just
like free performance that's there for
the taking that is all for this video
though guys if you enjoyed it don't
forget to hit that like button and also
down in the description you can find
links to my store for example or you can
buy t-shirts mugs and glasses also leave
me a comment to let me know what CPU
you're running if you overclocked it
what frequency you were able to hit
thanks again for watching this video
though and we'll see you in the next one
