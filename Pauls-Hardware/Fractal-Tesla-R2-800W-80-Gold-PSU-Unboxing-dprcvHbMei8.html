hardware today I'm going to be doing an
unboxing and overview of this 80 plus
gold rated power supply from fractal
this is the tesla r 2 800 watt starting
off with a look at the front of the box
we can see the 80 plus gold logo amongst
to the other logos as mentioned that
gives it an efficiency of 8790 and
eighty-seven percent at 20 50 and 100
percent load and usually manufacturers
will need to use higher quality internal
components in order to meet the 80 plus
gold standards so big reason why I got
this particular power supply it is also
SLI and crossfire certified and I
actually chose this one specifically the
power a gtx 780 one of them to begin
with but I wanted to have headroom to
power two of them and I'm quite
confident that this power supply could
push to seven 80s you also get a three
year manufacturer warranty from fractal
so that's nice to have on the back of
the box we have your traditional
marketing speak about clean quiet and
efficient power stylish and contemporary
Scandinavian design also of course the
80 plus gold efficiency chart if you
wanted a visual on that you got a single
12 volt rail design which is again a
nice selling point of this power supply
extra-long 70 centimeter ATX 12 volt
cable so even in a taller case you
should have enough cable length there
and also they have a fan speed shirt for
the temperature controlled one hundred
and thirty-five millimeter ball bearing
fan and a DC output power chart of
course you can see here it has that 66
amp single 12 volt rail that can push up
to 792 wats you also have a white box
inside the outer sleeve of the inner box
for accessories you get a manual it does
manual type things you get four screws
there black for connecting the power
spot of your case too long velcro straps
which are handy to have a low velcro 5
zip ties an AC power cable of course
pretty standard there and the power
supply itself comes in a pouch oh that
I'm not doing a very good job of showing
that the power supply speaking of has a
nice black housing it's got the fractal
design logo on the side and it's just
165 millimeters in length which is
that's a shorter than most typical 8800
watt power supplies and I should mention
this is a standard ATX form factor power
supply you can also see the hundred and
thirty-five millimeter white ball
bearing fan that kind of keeps the black
and white traditional fractal color so
I'm using this as a fractal to find our
for case and I know it's going to match
beautifully the fan is also very quiet I
can vouch for that as well since I've
actually used this even up to like fifty
sixty percent fan speed you can just
barely hear it at all FCC and power
information on the other side there's
your power chart again and 80 plus gold
logo on the power supply itself and hex
grilling at the back which I love
because hex grilling is just about the
best for exhaust and airflow you also
have an AC cable plug of course there at
the back and the on/off switch on the
top you have an engraved fractal
snowflake which I think also looks
pretty cool I did do a build with this
power supply if you guys are interested
you can check it out and the fractal
snowflake especially if you get some LED
light going across it looks really
really nice and in case you also didn't
notice the frack or the housing of the
power supply has kind of beveled edges
around the sides which also looks pretty
cool non-modular cables at the back as
you can see one of the downsides of this
power supply but that's one of the
things that did to keep the price more
reasonable also some additional hex
ventilation at the back since this is
kind of a shorter power supply they
wanted to make sure that you get plenty
of ventilation for the innards the
cables are all sleeved quite nicely it's
not like cloths leaving or anything like
that but you can see some of the cables
the inner cables on the sleeves are
still there brightly colored colors as
they are traditionally they're going to
pick through just a little bit
especially right up near the connectors
so maybe consider some extensions if
you're really concerned about how the
cables look for the cables themselves
you get your standard ATX 20 or 24 pin
you get a single ATX 12 volt that is the
longer 70 centimeters you get for pci
express graphics or peg connectors all
those are six plus two pin so pretty
much good for single or two-way graphics
card configurations 7 serial ata
connectors only to 4-pin molex but I
found those are less and less frequently
used and you can always
splitters on them if you really need to
they do have the little squeeze to
release plugs which I love from molex
plug that tend to get stuck a lot and
lastly a single floppy connector and
that is going to wrap it up for this
video guys once again this has been the
fractal tesla r 2 800 watt power supply
thank you very much for watching if
you'd like to leave me some feedback you
can do a like or dislike down here or a
