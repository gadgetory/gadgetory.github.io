brought to you by monoprice who you
might already know for their extremely
well-made low-priced
and lifetime warranty backed cables of
all varieties but today I'm going to
show you really quickly some of the
other products from monoprice that I use
on a regular basis monoprice does pro
audio now so down here is the small
sound board that we use every week for
our awesome Hardware live show up here
is a large diaphragm condenser
microphone this one sounds great we
haven't used it yet but we're going to
be integrating it very soon they also
have professional audio accessories such
as this boom stand over here as well as
the pop filter monoprice has a wide
variety of power banks this one belongs
to my wife and have other models
available as well here's my wife's
wireless bluetooth headphones so these
she connects up to her smart phone and
then she can wander around the house
listening to her music or her audiobooks
it's fantastic monoprice also has these
tripods here
did you know monoprice had tripods yes
there's a aluminum one there's a
carbon-fiber one both of those will
compare it in mono pods if you need them
to there's also a smaller multipurpose
tripod down there and all of those come
with carrying cases over here is the
monoprice 4k monitor with the glossy
screen and i have done a full video
review on that so you can check that out
if you want and lastly we have the steve
helping hands steve model available at
monoprice soon rights really no I'm not
but definitely we're here to support you
Paul and we're happy to do it on top of
that you guys can pick up all these
products at monoprice com alright and
Steve very soon
excellent hello everyone and welcome to
Paul's Hardware behind me on the table I
have the exploded view of the arctic
panther that's right this is the final
build log video on arctic panther and I
follow up still with some performance
and that kind of things but I'm I'm just
extremely happy to be at this stage in
the build because this is a project I've
invested many many hours of work into
and it's come a long way I've been
working on it for months and I'm really
happy to be now at the point where I can
well put it all back together since I've
been taking everything apart over the
past day or two I've actually been
working on computers for more than half
of my lifetime since I was a teenager
and I always built computers with the
thought for necessity in mind I would
build a computer because you needed it
to do this or you needed it to be able
to do that and the idea that computers
could actually also be aesthetically
pleasing was something I was aware of
but I didn't really place much stock
into if the money were investing didn't
go straight towards more performance I
was always kind of like well what's
what's really the point so that's why
stuff like modding or water cooling to
the extreme or even stuff like like
cable sleeving for example I didn't
really have much interest in I
definitely appreciated it and I liked
looking at that but I never had the time
to invest nor the money to invest so I'm
really happy at this point to have been
able to do something like this and I
will say that it's given me a much
greater appreciation for the amount of
effort that goes into projects like
these and I hope maybe by sharing it
with you guys through my youtube channel
you have also shared in some of that
realization with me as well but before I
move into a old time-lapse footage of
reassembling this whole thing I have a
checklist that's great I made a list of
actual things to do let's run down what
I'm actually going to be doing here as
well as one quick final look at all the
final parts that are going into this
build so here's my to-do list as you can
see I have a little bit of work to do
I'm sure I'll get it all done very
quickly but let's say a big thank you to
all my sponsors and we'll start off with
fractals since they have the biggest
component right here at the center this
is the fractal define r5 in my in my
opinion vastly superior to the define s
way way way better now they're both good
cases they're very simple
the finest just came out right after the
define r5 and if I most like Oh
everything you did here to find our five
they now having to define us and I was
like no no I'm still happy with the r5
anyway I'm sticking with that decision
also from fractal we have the power
supply the Newton r3 1000 watch that I
spent many many hours Reis leaving and
hopefully all that will look beautiful
once it's reinstalled
finally from fractals some late entries
these have been tree HP twelve hundred
and twenty millimeter fans and I swapped
these these out for the ek var DARS not
that there's anything wrong with the ek
VARs but I got the three thousand rpm
versions and I just way too fast I could
have gotten lower rpm ek vard ours but
the fractal venturi were available they
had just come out and I was like maybe
I'll try those out and they've been
really good so far
speaking of ek though a huge huge naked
ek my water clean the sponsors were ek
and then primo chill I also have a few
bits power parts but they didn't
actually directly sponsor me I just
picked those up because I needed some
fittings but ek provided the two
radiators right here the 240 and the 360
they provided the pump res combo that
you can see right here that's a d5 it
was PWM control that I also did some
sleeping on also from ek my beautiful
GPU blocks as well as the connector part
right here the dual parallel three slots
terminal that connects the two together
and keeps them very sturdy also so yeah
ek came through big time and I'm really
happy with all the stuff they sent over
since we're looking at these also say a
big shout out to gigabyte because they
provided the two gtx 980 s that are
under these water blocks although they
don't look as much like gigabyte 980 s
anymore they are their customer be c
bees and all that good stuff and they're
they're going to be beastly finishing
off the water cooling components though
primo chill sent me over these lovely
fittings i ended up going with the black
ones and then they also sent me the
rigid ptg tubing which you can see a few
of right here it's a little bit stained
because it's already been in a loop and
i washed out and stuff like that but the
ptg tubing is great and a big thank you
to pretty much chill for supplying me
with that hardware there g-scale sent me
the 32 gig kit of Ripjaws for memory
this is 2400 speed and yes 32 gigs are
four by eight gigs that's a massive
kits and i really
happy that I have 32 gigs especially for
video editing purposes on the storage
side I'm actually very very happy with
my storage solutions I have the original
Samsung 850 Evo right here which is a
256 gig that's going to be from my
operating system I have a couple of
these Samsung 850 pros as well these are
512 gig models so these are going to be
going into raid 0
that'll be my working disc for the for
video editing that's a one terabyte
total that's really fantastic from WD 4
mass storage and redundancy I'm going to
be dropping in a couple 4 terabyte WD
black drives so those will be in raid 1
for redundancy and data data storage and
all that stuff and lastly just because
it's overkill I have the intel SSD 750
series this is an nvme SSD 1.2 terabytes
this is like the fastest SSD that's
currently available at the consumer
level and I'm putting it in there
because I don't have 980ti s I guess I
don't know I needed I needed something I
needed a trump card also from Intel at
the heart of this build is 59 60 X their
highest and haswell-e processor from
Intel thank you for the CPU as well as
the SSD and then from Asus we have the
x99 deluxe motherboard one of the
original components from this build that
I decided on really early on still doing
a really good job and then of course
it's got the ek supremacy block on there
as part of all of the water cooling
components the ek sent over and finally
some extra water cooling parts over here
these are the fittings that J lent me
I'm swapping them these black fittings
some of which are from bits power some
of whit's which are from eBay and don't
have any labeling on them but I'm going
with all black for the fittings I hope
it looks nice but that's about enough
intro and exposition for this video I
think on with the build
and there it is that's the Arctic
Panther that is as finished as it's
going to get for this video it's pretty
much finished it's not quite finished so
really quick before things get all
dramatic I wanted to point out the
shameful bits the parts that I'm really
not a hundred percent satisfied with
first the PCI Express graphics cables
right there they look real nice but
they're not straight I need to train
them more I need to maybe get some cable
combs I don't have them yet but I need
to finish this video so that'll be
something else I can come back to the 24
pin actually like how it turned out but
um that could probably flattened out a
little bit too second there's actually
one Bend in particular here that I'm not
a hundred percent satisfied with either
it's this one an upper right don't look
at it too close don't look at to look at
it's okay anyway and then of course I
also wanted to show you the shameful
bits back here uh-huh yeah the cable
management was a bit tough on this one I
never ended up doing anything to finish
or put a connection between that outer
bit here for the hard wired cables and
the ones going back here it's okay
they're all just kind of thrown up back
here in the back of the case but no
worries I had to add some extra
connectors to get everything wired up
with LEDs and everything and here you
can also see my draining system which
I've already used ten works quite nicely
also back here is the only bits of real
hardware that you can't see from the
front and that's the two samsung 850
pro's which are camp in there looking
nice and do a great job and just because
a few people asked about it there's a
look at my specially designed serial ata
inline cable I did that in my cable
sleeving video I know it doesn't look
very good from the back but the only
parts you can really see it from the
front are the nice parts but now I do
believe it is time to power on the
arctic panther
you
well I cannot even believe I'm about to
say this but that is all for the final
Arctic Panther build block and wow I it
works the whole freakin thing works I'm
amazed at that I am so happy with the
end result of this entire thing and
before I go any further I want to say
another big shout out I already kind of
mentioned that the hardware sponsors at
the beginning but I also want to say a
huge thank you to the guys in the
modding community who have helped me out
either directly or indirectly by posting
resourceful help resource by posting
videos and other helpful guides and that
sort of thing so uh bill Owen from MN PC
tech talk me through a lot of the
modding for the side panel and he has a
great store there he also provided like
the LEDs that you can't see it here but
they're shining very nicely and all the
hardware so fantastic store check Adam
and PCM MPC tech comm is going to see
more of Bill Owens stuff also Leigh
Hearon - Lea Harrington as well as Dave
over it mainframe custom comm who did
provide me with the sleeving as well as
some advice in there as well so the
tools I use mike AKA AKA Lutra landon
burger Lutra customs who has some
fantastic guide videos up on the
sleeving that i also referenced there so
big thank you to those guys for just
doing what they do keeping things
awesome and also sharing their knowledge
with the rest of the community I do plan
on doing some benchmarks on this so I
will do a follow-up video with some
performance and maybe I'll also add in
some some tiny aesthetic finishing
touches at the same time there but I've
spent enough of your time looking at
this gorgeous PC I hope you guys have
enjoyed the arctic panther trilogy it no
it's more than a trilogy that arctic
panther saga
