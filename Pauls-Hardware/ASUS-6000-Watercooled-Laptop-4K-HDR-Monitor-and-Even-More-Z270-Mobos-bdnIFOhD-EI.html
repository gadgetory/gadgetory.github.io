coverage of CES 2017 I am here at the
Asus suite at Trump Tower but first a
big thanks to my sponsors for CES 2017
gigabytes ocz a Toshiba company as well
as deep pool a big thanks to them and
their links are down in the video's
description now there's tons of stuff at
the Asus booth as always so let's get
right into it let's start with some
peripherals three mice this is our OG
Strix and this is our o districts and
this is just our og this is the Gladius
- it is a unique design and that it has
swappable arm around switches that
upgraded a lot of stuff they have
actually have new switches with 12,000
dpi sensitivity and the ability to
switch switch them out giving you up to
50 million clicks per switch and of
course it has our RGB lighting and it
will work with the Asus aura software
there's an RG Strix of all over here
which is ambidextrous as you can
hopefully see and you can actually
remove each of these clique panels the
left one on the right one and it comes
with options for left-handed or
right-handed people because the travel
distance on your left and right click or
difference and they want to make sure
that they have accommodated either one
next we have the RG strict impacts
impact this one is light and fast and
stealthy and it's gonna be a little bit
less as a purse than the RG Gladius two
very nice little mice so speaking of
aces or a sink that's the software for
RGB lighting control that they've been
working on developing I'd say over the
past year year and a half since the RGB
thing kind of took off so this system
they have set up here is a really good
example of how it works
coordination of many different parts
internally as well as a bonus features
so right there you have g.skill tread NZ
memory with RGB lighting control
coordinating with the motherboard to
make everything look it's an RGB
lightning storm as far as I can tell is
the effect that they're going for right
now you also have of course RGB LEDs on
the motherboard itself you have RGB LEDs
on the back plates of both of the asus
rog graphics cards there which I believe
are Strix 1080 gaming X twos and then
also you have RGB strips on the case two
sides over here and then they took and
went outside the back of the case with
this little cable and they connected it
up to this wall this wall of our genus
going on there so you
coordination and not not only all the
RGB lights inside the system but you can
also go out and like decorate your desk
or the wall or something like that and
then of course if you get the right
peripherals from Asus like monitor
keyboard mouse it also have asus rog or
a support or lighting or lighting
support then you can Ford Nate
everything with the RO genius I really
want to quickly point out the this
Magnus right here because it's a new
product that ASIS hasn't really taken on
before it's a microphone so features
here are a studious to do great
condenser capsules you actually get
three of them whereas you would
typically only get one with the mic of
this quality price point they're looking
at is going to be around 150 H dollars
125 to 150 and it's got USB connectivity
it's got individual controls here so you
can manually type things up or down if
needed on the fly and again support for
the asus rog or lighting coordinate to
everything with rog lights i continue
with some ROG stuff here's a motherboard
that JJ did not have available when we
did our video on the z 270 launch which
you guys should check out by the way
this is the Maximus
9 extreme so I have three motherboards
here I want to show you really quick
Maximus 9 extreme has all of the extreme
type level features that you would
expect from their previous extreme level
boards so lots of Io stuff there and
monitoring control and all that good
stuff USB 3.1 header that's really cool
but you're probably noticing this
waterblock it's actually a mono block
right here at the top asus designed it
bit power actually made its power
actually manufactures it it includes
really cool features that I haven't seen
in a monoblock such as these little
rings right here which detect if there's
a leak and you can set up a warning or
tell it to shut down the system or a
delayed shutdown you have options in the
software this little cover right here is
for MDOT too so you can put an MDOT to
drive in there if you get one that gets
too hot drastically reduces the
temperature of like a really fast m2
nvme SSD and then you have crazy support
for fans you actually have 12 fan
headers like four up there and then
another like eight down here and they're
all grouped very specifically so you can
connect up lots of radiators and have
them all in a group and that kind of
thing there's other features here as
well but I'm running out of time so
let's move over here to this long line
of motherboards which
lots of them I actually already talked
about but I didn't talk about this one
this is the apex and this is kind of the
offshoot of the extreme the extreme was
previously you know the top-end best of
the best and that still is the case the
apex is split off to be a bit more
geared towards really high-end and
enthusiast overclocking now that's not
so you couldn't get the apex and use it
for other tools or features or you know
just build a nice system out of it but
you'll know for example to DIMM slots
instead of four
all of this is to reduce signal noise
that might potentially reduce your
chances to get getting really high-end
overclocks
they have this crazy thing right here
which is actually an MDOT two riser
riser adapter card that they fit into a
dim slot which is kind of crazy but
gives you some MDOT to support without
having it to have potential noise or
signal interference with the rest of the
board and they've gone with other
features like IC chips in there that are
much better for high-end overclocking so
if you're gonna see like World Records
for KB Lake being broken by asus or
overclocking team it's probably gonna be
done on this board of course on the
right side you have a you know voltage
repoint s-- and all that type of stuff
you can individually turn off certain
features of the board and also if you
haven't noticed this board has a kind of
a cool design to it is ATX but it has
sort of an X design so you might notice
the PCB kind of pops out there a little
bit on the corners which is also kind of
unique and then of course again a full
RGB support a little panel down here
that you can kind of customize you could
replace that and put your own logo on it
or something like that
if you wanted to alright so what we have
here is an ITX board at a micro ATX
board the ITX board is fairly new the
mini micro ATX board is actually already
available so check those out these
should all be available if they're not
out now they should be available by the
end of the month with possible exception
of that extreme board now the ITX here I
just I just think they did a great job
on they have answered the call that many
of us have had to give us an ITX board
that also has color neutrality for the
most part they've also included an m2
which actually is installed via this
little guy right here which is cool
because it gives you the ability to have
some additional cooling on it m2 will
slot right in their active heatsink for
it so
keep your m2 nvme drive nice and cool
and it fits on the front of the board
right there you'll notice there are some
silver accents but other than that no
real colors there is integrated Wi-Fi
and then there are some LEDs on the
board but you can disable those and if
you do want to have again that RGB
support although there are not no active
RGB lights on this board there is an RGB
LED header over there so you could
integrate that with your case and then
of course coordinated it with the lights
in your case or other Asus RGB products
if you wanted to and then we have the
Strix Zi 270g gaming micro ATX board I
don't have a lot of information about
this board but I just wanted to show you
guys that it exists maintaining a lot of
the design and other features that we've
seen with a lot of these boards RGB
support all that good stuff and it looks
cool and I like micro ATX here's a cool
little product it's called the ROG
rapture it's actually a router a quad
core router features gain boost and
gaming port technology this again coming
out in q2 they're not quite finished
designing it it's gonna have support for
really high speed storage it's either
going to be integrated or available via
connectivity via USB but it's going to
give you just altra fast storage so you
could potentially like use this as an
Astra plate replacement or something
like that but tri-band AC Wi-Fi 8
Gigabit LAN ports for Wired devices in
to ultra-fast USB 3.0 ports and it looks
like an upside-down spider monitors
these are exciting actually the one in
the middle is really cool it's a new
industrial design and this is part of
the Asus well it's not a pro arch actual
series monitor it is the MX 3 8 v q it
is 37.5 inches diagonal from there all
the way down to there it is a the
resolution is crazy it's 38 40 by 1600
which is not 21 not 21 by 9 it's
actually a bit taller than 21 by 9 the
4k version of 2009 would be 38 40 by
1440 this is again 38 40 wide 1600 tall
so you get a bit of extra vertical space
it's just a beautiful looking monitor
the panel is sourced from LG also
includes 8 watt stereo speakers sonic
Master technology so you can actually
route your audio like say you have a
laptop that doesn't have very good audio
quality we can right
through the monitor and then plug your
headphones in there and you'll get a
much better audio experience that's
really cool again coming in q2 over here
we have a 4k HDR display which just
looks beautiful and asus is still in
search of incredible this is a 32 inch
4k HDR quantum dot monitors so the color
space reproductivity on this monitor is
absolutely insane
you get 85% of REC 2020 support which is
like the widest color spectrum standard
that's kind of been standardized but
usually it's only is in really high-end
stuff 99.5% of Adobe though 95% of dcpip
300 percent srgb just a beautiful
looking monitor pretty cool looking
stand down there as well and it's 4k pre
calibrated with pro art calibration that
includes hardware calibration tools in
there as well again coming in q2 and
finally I can't leave without talking
about this new monitor can you tell
which one is the better one these demos
are supposed to be synced but I turn
them on at the wrong time but you can
kind of get an impression back and forth
obviously you're not watching this on an
HDR monitor but the one on the right is
HDR the new one RG swift PG to 7uq the
one on the left is last year's model
also a very nice monitor of course but
this one on the right is better we have
4k supports it is an r g series monitors
so you have cool little extras like you
know that fires the RG asus the RG logo
down at the ground underneath the
monitors display 144 hertz rapid refresh
rate and video desync support of course
4k HDR 3840 by 2160 and it's an IPS
panel so you should have better color
depth theoretically than you know a
trashy old TN panel or something like
that
DisplayPort 1.4 and an HDMI 2.0
compatible and I think this is a very
very nice monitor I don't know how much
it's going to cost though and I said I
was gonna finish with that monitor the
JJ insisted that I should talk to you
guys about this laptop - let's start
with the bad part right off the gate
it's a six thousand dollar laptop no
apologies it cost six thousand dollars
it must be worth it what they've done
here if you didn't couldn't already tell
is of course integrated their liquid
cooling
it's hot swappable of not hot so you can
hot swap all right it's hot swappable
liquid cooling with that unit in the
back so you can run an air cool
with just what's here or you know keep
that unit at home and when you're ready
to game plug it in there 18 inch display
IPS with g-sync dual GTX 1080s in there
full sized ones
it also has what's the CPU okay I'm not
so it's like a 7700 K it's kind of like
a 7700 K it's some mysterious version of
the 7700 K that JJ seemed is very very
mysterious about mechanical RGB backlit
keyboard obviously it's a fairly
substantial laptop being that it's more
of a desktop replacement made for gaming
and I imagine you can do lots of content
creation and that kind of thing on this
as well and of course full asus rog
or RGB support rog or RGB i've been
repeating that statement over and over
again so guys if you want if you don't
like desktop computers but you want one
that you wanted in a laptop and you have
$6,000 the ROG GX 800 is absolutely
insane so there you have it guys my
breathless coverage of the Asus suite
and I swear I've only talked about like
a third of the things they have they
have a complete other room that they
wanted to show us but we ran out of time
so let me know what you think of this
video hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it a big thank you of course to
my sponsors Kyle as well as gigabytes
ocz Toshiba and deep cool thanks you
guys more coverage of CES 2017 coming
very soon we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
