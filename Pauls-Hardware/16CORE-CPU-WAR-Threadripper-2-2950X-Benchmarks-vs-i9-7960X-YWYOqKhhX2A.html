the sponsor link in the description to
learn more so guys I may have gotten a
little overexcited about this thread
report to lunch but hear me out these
new CPUs slots into an existing x3 99
motherboard all it needs is a BIOS
update and I just finished putting the
system together the easily upgradable
Riptide which is also custom water cools
and I have this system over here on my
left the Arctic Panther build with the
79 60 X which is a 16 core 32 thread
processor seemed like a good comparison
to the threader for 22950 X that AMD
just sent over and both of these systems
have two-way issue Strix gtx 980ti s and
sli and everything is custom
water-cooled so why not set up a massive
battle between Riptide and arctic
panther well there are a few reasons so
3 over 2 is AMD's 12 nanometers n plus
based follow-up to their first ever
high-end desktop platform that they
launched last year with the X 399
chipset and TR 4 socket they promised a
32 core 64 thread processor on this
platform with threader / - back at
Computex and details has sort of
trickled out over the past couple months
so here are the four actual CPUs that
AMD is launching the 32 core 2990 WX
available today the 16 core 29 50 X that
I am testing today that's going to be
out on August 31st and then they 12 and
24 core variants that were expecting to
launch in October ultimately though
things just did not go smoothly with my
testing and I mainly attribute that to
my choice to do benchmark comparisons on
to custom water-cooled builds with 1080
TI's in sli if you guys came here
looking for some cpu performance
comparisons don't worry I've got you
covered there but when it comes to
gaming and overclocking I'm just not
comfortable sharing my full results just
yet that said let's go over the hardware
that I'll be using to test and compare
today so test setup number one is
Riptide right here and that is going to
feature either the AMD risin thread
Ripper 1950 X which is a 16 core 32
thread CPU launched last year or the new
thread repair 29
50 X 2 16 or 32 thread to CPU just
launching today it's got an asus x3 99
zenith extreme motherboard in there
running the latest UEFI version that
aces provided 0:06 for it's also a fully
custom liquid-cooled with parts provided
by alpha cool it's got a foreigner and
20 millimeter radiator in the top and
push-pull just for the CPU but please
note it's a CPU block I'm using it's not
designed specifically for threader / so
I'm only expecting standard water
cooling performance here it's also got
two Asus Strix GTX 1080
OC cards running it they're out of the
box manufacturer overclock that's about
nineteen seventy-five megahertz boost on
this system four by eight gigs of
g-scale flex ddr4 3200 memory and quad
channel and I did swap this in
originally I have 128 gig and Corsair
Vengeance RGB kit and here but
fortunately although it did take a
little bit of finagling I was able to
remove those sticks and pop these and
this is simply to maintain memory
equivalency between both systems 32 gigs
total and with the XMP settings it's
running at 3200 speed with timings of 14
14 14 34 and 1.3 5 volts for storage
Windows 10 is loaded on the coarser
Neutron nx500 400 gig nvme SSD and then
the power supplies the corsair x 1600
i've if you'd like some more details on
the hardware in the system because
there's actually a secondary system in
the bottom two it's in the coarser 1000
d please check out my Riptide build blog
series it's extensive and dramatic I
highly recommend it the sky like X
system though here my left is arctic
panther of course which has been through
multiple iterations but right now it's
sporting a core I nine 79 60 X from
Intel 16 cores and 32 threads to the
same court and thread count on both
systems asus rog Strix x - 99 - a gaming
motherboard and then storage in this
system is Windows 10 on the Toshiba OC
zrd 400 one terabyte nvme SSD for
excellent are 3 1000 watt power supply
and for 8 gig sticks of g.skill trident
z RGB ddr4 memory running at that same
3200 XMP setting then of course for
graphics cards - asus strix gtx 980ti is
once again water-cooled once again
overclock they're still using the out of
the box manufacturer overclock but i
found late in my testing and this is
part of the reason why my gaming testing
is not complete these two cards are
actually running at 1962 megahertz which
just a little bit slower than Riptide
but it was enough that there's a
disparity if you look strictly at the
GPU performance the GPU driver though is
the latest from nvidia 398 - and I'm
also running AMD's Rison master
software on the threader per system and
Intel's turbo boost max 3.0 on the
skylake X system for comparison I'm also
going to throw in my original threader
for 1950 X benchmarks from last year
updated 1950 X benchmarks with the
Riptide cooling 2950 X in Riptide and of
course C 79 60 X in arctic panther
so starting off with Cinebench this is
based on Maxim's cinema4d software and
it uses all of the cores and threads on
the CPU to render a scene so here we can
see a bit of an uplift from last year's
1950 X results to this year's 1950 X
results the winner here is definitely
the 2950 X though as it scored 31 28
interestingly the 79 60 X came in just
between at the 1950 X and the 29 50 X
moving over to a single thread mode and
this basically tells the story of AMD
versus Intel right now AMD is going to
win your multi-threaded benchmarks
Intel's gonna win your single threaded
benchmarks as these 70 960 X here with
the score of 188 next up a CPU mark
which is part of the pass mark
benchmarking Suites here again we have
multi-core mode where the 29 50 X wins
again with the score of 26,000 661 the
79 60 X is still beating my 1950 X
scores but it is good to see that Zen
Plus is giving the 2950 X a nice push
and then here in single thread mode the
29 50 X manages to pull on upsets and
score 20 286 over the 79 60 X's score of
22 11 I believe this is the benefits of
XF are coming into play which will push
a single or a couple threads up to a
much higher frequency with the new
rising thread river processors next up
we have blender which is a free open
source 3d creation suite and I have
three different tests that I ran in
blender the shortest of which is the
fishing cat splash screen and this is
time in seconds so lower is better the
29 put TX wins with a time of 20 4.6
seconds
next is BMW 27 a more complex render
which takes a little bit more time so
here the 29 50 X came out on top again
with 154 second total completion time
although the 79 60 X is right on its
heels with a time of hundred 58 seconds
and finally the classroom render which
takes the most amount of time out of any
of these and here the 29 50 X and 70 960
X are essentially in a dead heat with a
time of 495 496 seconds next is pov-ray
3.7 just using the built in benchmark
here this is a software suite that uses
the sea
to compute ray-tracing in order to
complete a render and here the 2950 X
wins once again with a total time of 40
2.6 seconds here the 79 60 X struggled a
bit and actually wasn't even able to
beat the 1950 X and here are the results
for Adobe Premiere Pro CC actually Adobe
Media encoder rendering a six-minute 4k
video at h.264 and here the 29 50 X
comes out on top once again with a total
time of 669 seconds now let's switch
over to some more game focused testing
and we're starting out with 3d mark
firestrike ultra I have to point out
here that the 1950 X results I have are
just with a single GT X 1080 Ti so
please bear that in mind the 1950 X in
Riptide 2950 X and 70 960 X are using
two-way GT X 1080 T is in SLI ultimately
though the overall and graphic scores
here are less important what we really
want to look at is the physics score if
we're specifically interested in CPU
performance and here the 79 60 X wins
just barely with the score of 27,000 147
and then here is 3d mark times pi which
is a DirectX 12 synthetic tests in the
3d mark Suites and again here we can
look at the CPU score if we want to
compare those numbers specifically
everything is still really close here
although for some reason in this test
specifically the 2950 X started to tank
and fall back a little bit in fact the
high score here is from my old last year
score for the 1950 X I don't have a very
good explanation for this but my guess
would be that with the 210 ATT is in SLI
you're seeing more frames which bogs
down the CPU a little bit more which
results in a lower CPU score in this
test specifically and my final numbers
here for GTA 5 which are just a little
bit off if you're looking at them
directly specifically that 79 60 X score
more on that in just a second but I will
say that the 2950 X did have an
impressive performance here with an
overall FPS of 139 and this is playing
at 1920 by 1080 which will put a little
bit more strain on the CPU as opposed to
the GPU so at this point I would usually
transition into some gaming benchmarks
and I was starting with GTA 5 and I was
doing stuff like turning game mode on
for the 1950 X and 2950 X using the rise
in master software but I'm also
benchmarking at 1920 by 1080 and that's
simply to put more of a load on the CPU
rather than the GPU we're supposed to be
testing CPU comparisons here by the way
and I should have just got to rewatched
my own at to wait n atti video from last
year and I would have remembered the GTA
5 doesn't really scale in SLI at 1080
least does a little bit if you get up to
4k but then arctic panther started
acting weird with choppiness and
starring as you can maybe see in its low
numbers and then I ran out of time
basically I was jumping back and forth
between both systems and trying to do a
lot at the same time in doing
troubleshooting and eventually I was
like you know what I don't have time to
complete a full summation of either of
the things that I want to do so I kind
of have to leave it at that I'm really
sorry guys but at least I do have those
cpu comparison numbers and I am planning
on looping back around and spending some
more time with the overclocking and
everything so I can give you guys some
additional comparisons some quick
temperature numbers though the 2950 x
only got up to about 66 degrees Celsius
the 79 60 X was topping at 58 degrees
Celsius so I think the monoblock
clear out that I did in there was
definitely helping and clearly there is
some overclocking Headroom so I should
get to that overclocking attempts with
Rison master 2 that I did try on the
threader 4 to stuff we're kind of hit
and miss it can be hard to get yourself
additional performance with manual
overclocking and thread Ripper I did
manage a four point one five gigahertz
overclock across all cores and then ran
CPU mark successfully so that improved
my overall score but the single thread
score on that test suffered because at
stock with xfr to one or two cores will
often run at four point three or four
point four gigahertz on a twenty-nine 50
X which would then perform better in
tests that only use one or two threads
probably also would perform better with
gaming there is though a new
overclocking method called precision
boost overdrive now that lets you set
values for socket power SOC voltage and
BRM current and then runs higher
frequencies within those parameters
again I saw some early success with this
method but overclocking is time
consuming and lots of restarts
involvement stuff so I just really need
to spend a few more evenings messing
with these tools and come back with a
follow up video if you guys are looking
at raw CPU performance though but the
rise in thread Ripper - in the 2950 X
Andy has clawed back some of the single
thread performance gap from Intel by way
of higher frequencies and the refinement
old nanometer manufacturing process in
this core for match up the 2950 x held
its own and even traded some blows with
these 7950 x buts when you take price to
performance into account it becomes a
complete blowout $900 is the price that
you pay for the 29 50 X whereas the 79
60 X retails for 1,700 people can
currently be found for about 1450 still
the 29 50 X is over $500 cheaper I hope
you guys enjoyed this video though and
my
once again for not diving into the
gaming and overclocking subjects in more
detail but I will end by sending you
guys on a raid I know this is a twitch
but we're doing a twitch that raid go
over to hardware unboxed because I know
Steve did a ton of benchmarks for this
launch like he always does and he has
the 32 core 2990 WX on hand which I plan
to steal from him very soon hit the like
button on the way out if you enjoyed
this video the guys and we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
