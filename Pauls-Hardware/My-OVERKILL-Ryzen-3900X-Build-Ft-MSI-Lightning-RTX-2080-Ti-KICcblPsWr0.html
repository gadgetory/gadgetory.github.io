today's video because I'm doing a build
which I actually haven't done in quite a
while
which was weird because I tend to do a
lot of builds on my channel but I need
to do a bit of explanation first off
because this is my first rise in 3000
series build and I parted out a couple
builds at the beginning of this month in
my builds serious video and my intent
was to build some reasonable systems for
you guys so I could be like hey if you
guys want to get these parts put it
together then you can do that but for
this initial build things got a little
out of hand
so there's a whole stack of Rison 3000
series processors starting at 200 bucks
for a 6 core twelve thread 3600 all the
way up to the $500 3900 X which is 12
cores in 24 threads and then there's
also the rise in 7 3700 X which I think
is going to be a really solid choice for
anyone building a gaming PC who doesn't
necessarily want to spend 500 on the
3900 X this one is about 330 dollars so
in the aforementioned monthly builds
video I parted out about a $900 system
with the rise in 3600 and then about a
1650 dollar system using higher-end
parts
this build is three thousand eight
hundred and fifty dollars and I was not
intending that so I have two parts lists
down in the video description
one is this build as is for three
thousand eight hundred fifty dollars or
so but then there's another parts list
down in the description with the more
reasonable version of this build that's
about fifteen hundred dollars less so
I'm gonna go over these parts and for
each part where I'm going to point out
that this is a very expensive part I'll
also recommend a less expensive version
so this build is based around the five
hundred dollar rise in 939 hundred x but
like I said there's a few other rise in
CPUs that are much more reasonably
priced if you don't have the scratch to
invest in this this is going to give you
the maximum amount of cores and threads
so you're going to get the most CPU
compute performance with this processor
and given the parts that I am putting in
the rest of the system it just didn't
seem to make sense to use any other
processor except that one the case I'll
be building with today is the Leanne Lee
PC o 11 dynamic but this is the special
razor Edition so it has some Razer logos
and it's got a black and green theme
overall I'm partially using this case
because I already had it here on hand
but I've also recommended the O 11
dynamic to lots of people it's got a
pretty cool layout and it's very
visually stunning once you get the whole
system put together so looking forward
to what this completed system will look
like for a motherboard
there's quite a few options in Ex 570
but right now again since some go on
high ends there are very reasonable be
450 motherboards that you can find right
now that you don't need to spend a ton
of money on this motherboard is well
over $300 and if you think that's
expensive I could have used the godlike
which costs 700 bucks but I have further
plans for that down the road more to the
point though if you do want an x5 70
motherboard so you can get PCI Express
Gen 4 and everything you can't get that
for around $200 or so so I put a more
reasonable MSI board and the second
builds down in the video subscription
for people who don't want to spend at
the amount of money that you have to
spend on this one one thing this board
does have that the other board does not
is a USB 3.1 gen2 front panel port that
I'll be able to use to get the plug on
the case actually working if there's one
part that inflates the price of this
build more than anything else it's the
RT X xx atti and not any RT X xx atti
this is MSI's highest end version the
Lightning Edition which is $1600 if you
can even find it for sale and I wasn't
able to find it for sale by the way this
is once again a part that I'm using
because I have it here but there are
much more reasonably priced versions of
the xx atti
getting down towards $1000 these days
which is still a lot for a graphics card
so consider an RT X 2080 or something if
you are going for very high-end but
don't want to spend $1000 but this is
the card I'm using and it's a really
cool looking card so again I think it'll
go nice with the case for storage here
I'm dropping in a couple drives this
Oris nvme Gen 4 SSD is one of the new
files on controlled PCI Express Gen 4
ones which have crazy reading write
speeds like 5,000 megabytes per second
reads and 44 hundred megabytes per
second writes this is a 2 terabyte
version of that drive which costs four
hundred and fifty dollars you did not
need to spend that much on your storage
you do not need PCI Express Gen 4 super
fast SSDs like this except for some very
specific applications the two terabyte 6
6 DP from Intel is much more reasonably
priced although it does use qlc NAND and
there are some caveats to that point
being though the secondary build in the
description has about a hundred and ten
dollar crucial SSD instead of these
which would be again a much more
reasonable choice if you're trying to
save a few bucks
for memory I have four eight gig sticks
of Team T force Nighthawk memory and I
chose this because it looks really cool
it has RGB lighting this gets actually
three
200 speed what I've linked in the
description is 3600 speed because that
is kind of the sweet spot that's being
recommended for Rison 3000 getting these
kits in 3600 trim where was costing
about a hundred and ten dollars per kit
so that's two hundred and twenty dollars
total for the memory which isn't that
terribly expensive especially if you're
comparing it to last year's prices but
you could get by with a slightly less
expensive 3600 speed kit that is to buy
eight gigs rather than four by eight
gigs and that again is linked to the
description for a power supply we have
the EVGA supernova 750 g3 80 plus gold
rated I have the special cable kit for
this so that's gonna look pretty which
is again part of the reason I chose this
it's a little over a hundred dollars
right now for this power supply there
are slightly less expensive ones but
it's a solid one so if you choose it you
will be happy finally for cooling our
CPU we have the master liquid ml 360 our
RGB from cooler master and RGB
all-in-one cooler which I've used for a
few builds now it's a nice performer it
looks really nice and I've also paired
it up with these master fan sf-36 dr a
RGB 3 by 120 fan kits so I'm going to
use one of these for radiator fans and
the other one for the intake on the O 11
dynamic and I think that will greatly
simplify the fan installation as well as
the connection of RGB LEDs but bear in
mind these cost about sixty bucks each
so again they are one of the bonus
expensive items that makes this whole
build a little bit more expensive than
it would be otherwise but there it is
guys my parts for my three thousand
eight hundred and fifty dollar rise in
939 hundred x build let's get this thing
put together
but I have two SSDs one of them is PCI
Express Gen 4 one of them is not I want
to make sure that the Gen 4 SSD is
plugged into the MDOT 2 slot that is
wired directly to the CPU because some
of these go through the chipset one of
them is going to go directly to the CPU
so for that we can look in the manual
here we can see one of these is labeled
chipset one of these is labeled
processor the processor one is MDOT to
underscore one flip over to this page
and we can see them labeled MDOT to
underscore one it's the top one that's
closest to the socket so that is where
our or s SSD will be installed once I
take it out of the box and then either
of these lower ones can be used for our
supplemental SSD
so guys this is coming along quite
nicely I was a little concerned about
everything fitting in here with in
particular the Lightning 20 atti from
MSI because it is a thick cart it is
wide this way it's also a triple slot
card it's an amazingly built card it's
got three fans it's got this LCD display
on the side 3/8 pin supplemental power
connectors four PCI Express power and it
comes with this MSI Lightning brace that
you can put along the bottom since it's
a heavier card it is probably gonna sag
a decent amount so try to install that
with the case on its side to get
everything lined up so I think there's
still a little bit of sag going on but
definitely less than there would have
been before the main issue I was
potentially gonna have with clearance
was for the power cables coming out here
and that can sometimes conflict with the
side panel I think they still might
barely touch up against it but
fortunately they're recessed on the PCB
just a little bit here and that gave us
just enough clearance to get by there
apart from that installing the CPU cool
and everything went pretty smoothly I
was hoping to rotate this a little bit
more because I feel like my tubing here
could be a little bit smoother but I'm
happy with it overall and I do want to
point out for the addressable RGB
headers there's two on the board at the
bottom so the two 360 millimeter fan
configurations are both plugged into
those and then for the adjustable RGB
that's part of the cooler master pump
block unit here that's connected up to
one of the individual control units
that's back in the cable management area
so at this point we're just going to do
the celebratory peeling of the plastic
off of the side panels and then we'll
give you guys a finished look
okay side panels are back on you know go
ahead and connect up the power here look
a little switch here and hope that this
thing boots up first attempt i pressing
the power button yay
so if you guys aren't familiar with this
razor version of the Lian Li PC 0:11
dynamic case there are a few upgrades or
changes that were made compared to the
original version one is the accent
lighting so there's two strips along
either side on the side and on the flip
side as well so it gives you kind of
some ground effect lighting and then
there's an additional strip that's just
on the right side of the front panel
here that kind of shines across the
front panel and then you have that
embedded Razer logo which is actually a
unique technique that they have used to
make that it's kind of sandwiched in
between the glass so you can't feel the
etching on the front or the back which
is kind of cool
and it actually also picks up the light
as it shines across as well is a little
sleepy dragon and I'm just being charmed
by the little lucky dragon animations on
the side of the 2082 UI lightning well
done MSI lucky is very cute and I'm glad
that you've an animated him he's
sleeping right now because the cards are
really not doing a lot of heart heavy
lifting at this point when it comes to
LED lighting on the case other than
what's part of the case itself of course
we have the two triple fan arrays from
Coolermaster those are all connected up
and you can see they each have
individual LED lights on them so those
are sort of pulsating and those are
connected directly up to the motherboard
so just being controlled by the motor
motherboard for right now also the team
at Nighthawk memory I've always liked
the effect that they have in there it's
kind of a flashy effect that drops down
from the tops or kind of a waterfall
built into it and of course it has a
cooler master logo lighting on the
all-in-one liquid cooler the Lightning
has some RGB LEDs that are highlighted
right above the LED readout and then
there's also some RGB lighting accent on
the back plate there as well and then
our x5 70 Meg ace motherboard from MSI
has an infinity mirror RGB effect
it's on the sort of shiny reflective
part that's right above the I guess the
IO also the heatsink for the motherboard
power delivery so I guess I did get a
little carried away as I was figuring
out the parts that I was gonna put in
this build today but ultimately even
though it is a very expensive build
everything came together and it's
functional and looks really nice I guess
that's probably the thing I like most
about it is that there's some
justification I guess for spending the
amount of money that you'd have to spend
to put this all together
because it really does look like a very
polished finish product that I think
just about anybody would be pretty happy
with but let me know what you guys think
of course down in the comments section
down below I'll put links to the parts
that I've used today in the video
description as well the thumbs up button
on your way out if you enjoyed this
video and we'll see you guys in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
