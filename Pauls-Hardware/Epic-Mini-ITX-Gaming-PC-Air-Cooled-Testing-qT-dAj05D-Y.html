back to Pauls hardware today's video is
sort of an in-between video for the
system that I am putting together it's
my epic water-cooled system I'm building
it for my wife it's a gaming and working
system and it's built in this toy yellow
mini ITX case from fractal to define an
OS now I already did a live build where
I sort of put this whole thing together
and I already have pointed out that this
is actually sort of a middle step when
it comes to the parts that are currently
installed I'm going to be swapping out
several of the components when it comes
to the final build but before I did all
that I wanted to run some tests to get
myself some sort of baseline numbers to
give myself a basis for comparison for
after I get everything installed when it
comes to the water cooling but before I
do all that why don't we take a quick
look at these water cooling parts that
have arrived because even though I'm not
installing any of them today I'm I'm
excited that they're actually here
here's the pile of water cooling parts
that I've arrived
courtesy of ek they really helped me out
with this build also Nuria is down there
so say say hi to her anyway like first
off look at this pile and compare that
to the size of the the actual system
itself and I like it seems crazy to me
that I'm actually going to wedge all of
this stuff into this computer even with
all the stuff that's currently there so
starting off on the right side I'm using
ek Vardar fans those are the 2200 rpm
versions but they are all black so
they're not going to be quite as as
aggressive as my 3,000 rpm versions that
I tried when I did the arctic panther
build over there last year next up we
have a bunch of fittings so I have I
have something like 14 or 15 fittings
that I'll be using with this ptg tubing
this is a 16 millimeter outer diameter
ptg tubing so it is a little bit wider
than what I used with arctic Panther
also since its ek and they're based in
in Europe it's using metric instead of
the Imperial standard so sure my EU
viewers will appreciate that for the CFU
block as the supremacy evo and that is
the clear ones so you'll be able to see
the
you'll be able to see what's going on
you know through there you'll be able to
see the color of a fluid color the flow
it's probably gonna be orange we were
going back and forth between orange and
green for this build we decided on
orange
I should hopefully even be able to show
you guys a teaser the power supply
sleeving
that I'm going to be doing that's going
to be done by insourced customs so
excited about that too anyway um I have
GPU block GPU backplate back here a
couple 240 millimeter cool screen these
are the slim Edition rad so I'm the 240
in the front and 240 on the top and I
should hopefully have enough room for
those and the fans again I've already
kind of done a little bit of test
measurement these are the parts I was
kind of most excited about because I'm
doing a split reservoir and pump so this
is my tangelo reservoir 110 millimeter
tall EK res so that's going to go kind
of an upper part above the power supply
on the top right and then i got the d 5
pwm pump this is the standalone version
so it's good this will this will be
facing the outside so you'll be able to
see a little bit of the fluid as it
cycles through there and this will be
mounted to that pump mount that is on
the bottom and then I'll be connecting
them up with fittings and tubing and of
course so again sorry this is just a
really quick look at all of this stuff
that's arrived but um thanks to EK for
sending it over of course and i need to
get this face done with so i can move on
to the very exciting next phase which is
actually installing all the water
cooling parts ok back to testing so
after I finished cooling all of my water
cooling parts and set them aside with
with some regrets that I can't install
them quite yet I decided to get the
system set up and since it's a brand new
system I first updated the BIOS if
you're gonna do a BIOS update I feel
like doing it before you've done or
anything else like Windows installation
is a good idea then of course I went on
with the windows installation that's
Windows 10 I couldn't avoid it in this
situation because I'm probably gonna end
up doing DirectX 12 with this system at
some point so just went straight for
that after installing windows did all
the windows updates installed drivers
got the system pretty much good to go I
devised five tests to run here to give
myself stability temperature tests as
well as a basis for comparison for
performance so the first test is just
the ida 60 for system stability test
that is a CPU centric test at least I
only ran the CPU centric portions of
that ran that for 15 minutes just to get
an idea of it to see if you stable and
what kind of temperatures I'm getting
with the cooling for the next ability
test I use msi combustor this is
basically an GPU stress test it takes
the GPU way further than you ever would
playing a game or something like that
but you figure if you can run this then
you're pretty much going to be stable
around just about anything on your GPU
ran that for 15 minutes then I did a
combo test running both Ida 64 as well
as msi combustor at the same time I did
that for about 10 minutes and then got a
comparison of what the temperatures are
and also just making sure things are
stable finally I have a couple actual
benchmark tests so Union Heaven 4.0 just
running that on the ultra setting at
1080 got the score or frames per second
from that and then Cinebench as well
which is again more of as CPU test so we
got GPU and CPU tests and I just went
ahead running everything at stock the
ambient temperature out here in the
garage has actually been pretty stable
at about 78 degrees Fahrenheit or 26
degrees Celsius for the rest of this
I'll try to use Celsius as much as
possible and for test one basically the
CPU is running in the high 40s
temperature-wise which is just fine
actually pretty good for a hyper 212 and
at stock it was running at about 1.2
volts the second test the GPU hit about
eighty degrees Celsius which is what
it's designed to do being a 980 TI the
GPU core clock ran at about 1350 for
initially that's the out of the clock
over out of the box overclock that's on
this gigabyte g1 gaming gtx 980ti hit 13
54 but as the temperature rose it did
toddle down to about 1300 a little bit
over 1300 which is what it was staying
at stable II the CPU actually ran hotter
in this test than it did during the CPU
stability test due to the extra
introduction into the system of warm air
from the GPU causing the CPU
temperatures to rise that's part of the
sort of drawback to using a small case
like this is a small case and I was
running all these tests with the side
panel on so it's just not a lot of
places for that hot air to go so the CPU
in that test was actually running at
about mid 50s which is again hotter than
it was when the CPU itself was under
full load for test three which was the
super uber stress test we had about the
same GPU and CPU performance the GPU is
still running in a
80 degrees CPU temperatures again went
up a little bit more and we were hitting
about 60 degrees C average for CPU
temperatures finally for the benchmarks
in this round again it stocks the system
scored 90 point nine frames per second
in Unigine heaven and 594 points in
Cinebench next up I moved on to
overclocking and since overclocking is
involve some trial and error and some
you know kind of a lot of system locking
up or reboots and stuff it took a little
bit longer than I was well nothing I was
anticipating but definitely then I was
hoping the CPU is my main concern when
it comes to overclocking mainly because
this motherboard is not necessarily
designed for high-end overclocking it is
a z170 but gigabyte does they push their
gaming series more this has a
three-phase power delivery and there is
no cooling no actual heatsink on the V
RMS particularly the MOSFETs and I'll
come back to that in just a second this
CPU the 6600 K I've already run in my
ASUS Maximus 8 formula that was able to
achieve about 4.7 gigahertz overclock
without any issues so I was hoping for
about four point six to four point seven
on this board I dialed in a four point
seven just right off the bat cuz kind of
doing a moonshot like I like to do I was
kind of aggressive with the voltage to I
did about plus 0.85 I believe or zero at
five so it was hitting about one point
three five to one point four volts
during CPU stress tests I was able to
initially pass the Ida 64 stability test
without any issues but when I moved on a
combustor I started having stability
problems blue screens and crashing and
that's never a good thing
apps crashing like that's not good but
not the worst blue screens I just I
don't like it all now since time was a
factor with all of this testing since I
am leaving for lanceton to get this week
I've got kind of a short work week I
decided to do a few things the first
thing was that I was not going to
concern myself with hitting maximum
overclocks with the system I am going to
be swapping out all the cooling so I'll
worry about that later for now I just
kind of want to get some some baseline
numbers that meant that I've gone for a
4.6 year Hertz overclock on the GPU
instead of 4.7 and by dialing that back
I was able to achieve some more
stability for the GPU added a hundred
points to the core clock and 150 points
to the memory clock and that fortunately
worked out and was pretty stable so also
I decided to go ahead
by power delivery cooling solution as
noted in several views on this board the
three pays three-phase power delivery on
the z170 and Wi-Fi is not helped by the
fact that there's no cooling on the
MOSFETs so these here are copper MOSFET
heat sinks by Enzo Tec I've actually had
these for quite some time and since they
are unfinished copper I decided to give
them a quick matte black paint job so
that they would match a little bit
better with everything else in the
system after that was installation which
involves some delicate work with
tweezers to get those thermal pads in
place but all together it really wasn't
too difficult just make sure you've got
some room to work with so with all that
started out I resumed my testing
thankfully my stability issues were
solved in test one I kept in the same
CPU stress test that I'd already ran at
4.7 gigahertz this is just to show you
guys how temps can start to spike when
overclocking in a small case with
additional CPU voltage and average CPU
temps here were about 70 degrees Celsius
for test two I went with the more
reasonable overclock so the CPUs at four
point six GPUs overclocked as already
mentioned it hit 83 C on the GPU core
temp this times a little bit warmer than
before but it still maintains the GPU
core overclock at 1442 and didn't throw
out settle that down over the course of
the testing so that's nice
again the CPU temps here we're pretty
high even though it's not a CPU test
stress test they got up to around the
mid-60s the full burn a test for test
three had me a little nervous I was
biting my nails but fortunately got
through it just fine and although the
fan noise still did get pretty
unbearable
with all the fans at full-bore in the
system let me just say I'm hopeful that
with the liquid cooling solution
installed that it's going to be much
much quieter anyway with everything
working really hard the GPU hit 83 C
again but maintained its GPU clock speed
again the CPU got all the way up to the
low to mid 80s
that's Celsius again which is acceptable
but it is hotter than I would want my
CPU to run for a 24/7 overclock with a
full load test going and everything
running at stock those MOSFETs were
hitting about 150 degrees Fahrenheit
that is about 66 or 65 degrees Celsius
when I overclocked but the MOSFET heat
sinks weren't on there they were
climbing up 270 degrees Fahrenheit which
is about 77 degrees Celsius and then
when I added those heat sinks on there
the temperatures dropped by about 10
degrees Fahrenheit down to 160 ish
that's about 71 degrees Celsius and then
I can't really say for sure if this was
the main thing that helped my stability
issues or if it was dropping him back
the CPU overclock but I am happy to have
them on there and I definitely much rat
much rather have them there and have
things run it a little bit cooler than
not have them on there at all finally
for those benchmark tests with
overclocks in place the Unigine Heaven
benchmark score jumped up to 99 point 5
frames per second and the Cinebench
score increased sits 741 and that's all
for this video guys really hope you've
enjoyed it I know it's kind of like the
the middle movie in a trilogy or
something like that it's kind of in
between phase but something that had to
be taken care of so I can move on to the
next step which I'm really excited about
that's getting all my water cooling
components installed if you enjoy this
