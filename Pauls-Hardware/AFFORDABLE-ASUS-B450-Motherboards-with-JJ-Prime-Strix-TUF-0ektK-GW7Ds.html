ddr4 memory gives you blazing fast speed
and dynamic multi zone RGB lighting with
ten ultra-bright LEDs per module
customization options are practically
endless with the corsair IQ software
package and they're available with black
or white heat spreaders find out more
about the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro
series via the sponsor link in the
description what's up guys how's it
going welcome to pulse hardware today is
a special video with JJ from Asus how's
it going JJ doing good happy to be here
I'm happy that you are here for one I
like you and you're a friend of mine for
two you work with Asus developing and
manufacturing these motherboards and I
think you take a lot of pride in your
work definitely do also we've got a new
chipset for AMD be 450 stole the am for
socket so it's looking to work with
first generation rising 2nd generation
rising as well as the ApS that are
available on that platform but we're
looking at less expensive motherboards
compared to x4 70 and we're looking at
still a really wide feature set as well
as the ability to overclock so JJ just a
quick high-level any updates for B 450
we should know about and then also maybe
the three series's of motherboards that
we have here in front of us oh nothing
super specific I mean for most intensive
purposes before 50 is gonna be pretty
similar to be 350 in terms of kind of
all the kind of key i/o spec and kind of
a layout and support that you noted ddr4
support is gonna be a little bit
different in terms of maximum frequency
that's officially supported compared to
expore 70 you get a little higher yeah
well no as far as just a baseline
frequency x47 yeah you're correct in
terms that it's officially quote-unquote
2900 speeds here's a little bit lower
its 2600 speeds okay but overclocking
support actually all these ports for
DRAM is more in that kind of 3000 ish
range so it's pretty much par for the
course so all the way around probably
the biggest difference that probably to
keep in mind is gonna be on the IO spec
and some of the storage and we can get
into that when we jump in the boards
cool alright and then from Asus we have
three primary motherboard lineups they
have the main stream represented by the
prime B 450 plus right here we've got
the tough gaming series that's
represented by the B 450 M Plus which is
a micro ATX board and then we've got the
highest end in this series which would
be the RO strict ROG strict series of
words this is the B 450 - F gaming where
should we start let's go ahead and take
a look at the prime right now other
words we're talking about today are
already available
for sale they launched earlier this week
so the prime be 450 - plus is up on new
egg I believe it's also available on
Amazon 110 dollars this motherboard
that's that's quite reasonable yeah and
I think that's the whole point you know
be 450 chips that it's the mid-range
series chipset the whole point is to try
to really give a good balance in terms
of kind of the core specifications so if
you want things like USB 3.1 gen2 or Gen
1 you still want type C connectivity you
want em to support still full
performance for PCIe gen3 all those kind
of key specs you're gonna want when
you're building a system are still are
gonna be present here the cool part is
of course still with before 50s you have
overclocking support for the CPU and for
the DRAM now with the prime series board
this is really I'd say more about kind
of turnkey experience it's probably not
gonna be free uses the one that jumped
straight into kind of overclocking you
know 2700 X on this board right there
really probably looking to take
advantage of the great in box coolers
that the CPU is already come with you
know the Wraith series actually are
quite solid they do provide a very
competent and experience in terms of
really maximizing the xfr performance as
well as the precision boost which if you
guys don't know those are now formally a
hundred percent baked in for second gen
rise in MP 450 where it wasn't
necessarily 100% fully supported on be
350 hmm and that was kind of one of the
benefits of going from X 370 X 470 was
kind of full support for this latest
generation of kind of how Aimee's
fine-tune some of the turbo technologies
but if we jump into the board
perspective I'm right off the bat I
really like the monochromatic color
aesthetic it's clean it's simple it's
gonna work with any type of bill you
don't have to worry about continuing
competing with colors this board does
add in from previous generations issues
or a sink support so if you drop in you
know compatible memory like here we've
got this t force Delta R you know of
course it may be a strict series
graphics card any of those type of items
you're good to go but plus you can
connect your standard stuff like fans
LED strips tasks with LED lighting
anything like that and some people also
wonder about what happens if you only
have one header you can get splitters
now you can get them from new egg and
Amazon they're cheap they're generally
in the range of like about like 7 to 10
bucks and you can go usually from one
two three or four additional headers so
it's a really easy way that if you want
to have more RGB connected devices you
can do that very simply let's the sync
control boxes that allows you to take an
input from the motherboard under the
control box the under splits it out to
let you control multiple things yeah so
that's a very streamlined so from there
beyond the monochromatic color stetic
you've got all the standard kind of eye
that you're looking for you got six SATA
ports you still have a full performance
MDOT to slot that fully supports PCI
gen3 with nvme support so whatever type
of MDOT you drive you want to pop in
there you're good to go and now this one
doesn't have a heatsink but we still do
kind of focus on thermal isolation so
it's not directly underneath that
physical by sixteen primary slot above
it so we don't have to worry as much of
from heat pooling right that we would
have from our graphics card and you also
still even get our upgraded isolated
audio design now the software package
isn't gonna be as extensive as what
we're gonna see on the tough gaming and
definitely not on the strict series yeah
but you still get a solid audio codec
this is a the eight eight seven as
compared to on the higher end boards
we're going to the twelve twenty like on
the Strix so there will be some
improvement there but overall I think a
really solid board you know that's gonna
give you a very turnkey experience if
you want to drop in something like you
know rise in five rise in three I think
it's a perfect choice and for ap use
which you noted earlier on - you do have
a full hdmi 2.0 certified port on there
and you're good to go and last but not
least i would probably say is on the drm
side the board does support up to 3200
speeds and it will support our DCP
memory profiling options so that
essentially just means that like if you
want to automatically apply the
frequency voltage and timings for your X
and T enabled kit just go into the UEFI
click that option it will load that
profile for you and you're good to go
it's a very simple process to do and
also ap user great sort of upgrade path
if you don't have quite as enough cash
to buy a discreet graphics card right
now and inexpensive motherboard an APU
will give you the ability to play games
right now especially for just gaming at
1080 and all these boards have video
outs in order to handle it yeah and
actually I didn't want to last on one
thing one other update that we have for
this generation the mid-range was just
nice is that we did being bring over the
fan expert for mapping technologies so
very shortly essentially what that
really means is that mostly on previous
gen boards the fan headers were always
responding to the CPU temperature but
now you do have GPU temperature sensing
points so that if you want let's say
your intake fans to respond to the
graphics card temperature you can set
that up within the fan expert software
nice that's a really cool feature all
right let's move on next we got the
tough gaming series and just to point
out you guys there are more motherboards
in each of these lineups than what we're
going over today so these are just kind
of representatives of the overall line
this is a micro ATX motherboard
currently on sale for $100 it is also
available in a full-size ATX version as
well the tough B 450 plus gaming on that
one's currently following 420 dollars
and
said not not a whole lot of difference
between the two besides the size yeah
exactly if you're just looking for that
ATX form factor and the benefits that it
provides or maybe just the aesthetic
perspective from it you pretty much
shift over to the non end version and
like I said it's a little bit more but
you can of course that a little bit more
expansion you would usually get with an
ATX series ma avoiding now just as kind
of quick recap most you may not
necessarily be familiar yet with tough
gaming it's still actually pretty new
from us this kind of replaces a previous
pro gaming line that we might have had
in our entry series segment so from Asus
if you're kind of looking for our
quote-unquote true gaming series board
so boards that are designed from an
aesthetic perspective software
perspective potential heart respect then
you're gonna be taking a look at tough
gaming is our entry level really
designed kind of for first-time builders
then we move into our Strix line and
then for kind of the users that are
really the kind of the dive in will
enthusiasts the most passionate users
people will want the absolute best we
have formal ROG but there is no ROG
series motherboards for p450 they're
essentially limiting it up to the top
align which will be this fixed before 50
- eff uhm so tough gaming though I think
once again has a clean nice stylized
aesthetic that's of course a bit more
game or s compared to what you have at
the prime and still predominately
neutral we do have a couple of things
that are here highlighting some of that
color tone that we have kind of selected
for the tough gaming line which is it's
sort of a nice alternative from the RGB
thing I think ya be like um and one
thing that we've kind of worked on very
heavily is that for this kind of segment
because RGB tends to be a little bit
more expensive in terms of kind of the
overall accessories and ecosystem up
parts is that we have created something
that we call the tough gaming Alliance
and so we've worked with a wide range of
partners you know from Coolermaster to a
team group with here you see an example
over the tough gaming Alliance memory
that we have that kind of designed to
match with this memory there's a
compatible fans there's coolers there's
a lot of different items so that if you
want to kind of build something that
looks aesthetically complementary it's
all tough branded you can do that but
when you take a look at the board itself
you can still see it's predominately
monochrome it does have aura sync
support so that if you still do want to
add something in terms of the header
just like we had on the prime Series
board you can do that you're good to go
does support have any light up elements
itself or is it just the header just
actually just the header on this board
go you're gonna have in terms of light
up everything else is pretty much
passive and this is going to be very
similar to the prime Series board you
know you've got the USB 3.1 gen2 support
m26 out of 60 ports on the board pretty
much all standard stuff that's par for
the course the one probably biggest
point of improvement
say an upgrade from the prime is going
to be the audio design of this one so
this is the toughest gaming audio and
the biggest difference is the codec is
essentially the same you still get audio
great capacitors the shielded codec and
the same actual codec that's used on the
prime but it features our tough audio
gaming package and so what we did there
is we worked with DTS and there's a
custom software suite that's optimized
for different game experiences you have
a little bit more customization options
to be able to kind of tailor the sound
experience but all the way around you
know very solid entry option if you're
looking to be able to kind of build
something it's got a little bit more of
a stylized focus and definitely I think
for a lot of users out there that were
interested in seeing a micro ATX version
so here you've done in micro X but
you've also got the ATX version which
and I was like the slightly smaller form
factor of micro ATX while you still have
a few expansion slots and yeah this
little board here the tough p450 m+
gaming and now under the big boy this is
the ROG Strix be 450 dash F gaming and
now our G is JJ already mentioned this
usually like the highest-end issue stuff
where they do lots of tricky things and
they experiment and do features that not
everyone is going to make use of ROG
Strix is sort of like taking that down
to a still high-end gaming level yep but
maybe not just all the crazy stuff that
you might not actually use yeah I
definitely say you hit it on the head it
sir I think really comes down to
specialization as an example you might
kind of jump into the cross here which
is on the X or Sony chipset and an
example something that everybody's gonna
use is like the dedicated temperature
Inlet and water flow monitoring right
that's built onto the motherboard right
for the water cooling crop that's great
but for the vast majority users they're
not doing that right or even you know
the more specialized vrm options or the
external bus clock generator so you
newbie CLK overclocking these are all
things that you know it's cool and
certain segments of the audience might
have but really we're Strix is is that
we're trying to offer you I think that
best balance that if you're just an
everyday gamer it wants a great
experience whether it's in the
overclocking fan controls audio and
networking as well as great aesthetics
that's all gonna be baked in you can
have a really great experience across
the board but at a definitely more
reasonable price point so I'm speaking
of price point this is currently
available for sale for 130 US dollars
yeah so I think definitely as we come
look through the board it's definitely
gonna feel I think like a more premium
board and actually it might be more
expensive than that
first and foremost you see the aesthetic
I think is great it's got this
monochromatic color scheme so it won't
contend and compete definitely this is
probably a board that's going to be more
squarely aimed at
target market that's gonna want to go
with an RGB type build experience and
it's gonna fit really well with that and
of course this also is gonna really
complement our strict series graphic
cards which feature the same kind of
overall matte black stylized clean
monochromatic color aesthetic some of
the cool things that you'll see that are
gonna be different than the prime or the
tough gaming series is we've got the
full integrated IO shroud but we also
have an integrated IO shield so that not
only makes the build installation
process more streamlined and easier a
lot of people don't realize that pre
mounting the our shield to the
motherboard also significantly improves
our EMI and ESD performance because we
can actually create a much more bonded
contact and so that's beneficial because
most issues that you have with EMI or
ESD is going to be actually related to
consistently plugging in devices and so
you plug most your devices into the
backplane so that's an improvement that
we have this board will feature
integrated RGB lighting so that will be
here the rgi okay you will have to RGB
headers on this board compared to the
other boards which only had one RGB
header so there's one here at the top of
the board and then another one down here
at the bottom of the board so that's a
really good kind of split configuration
for how you might do building in the
chassis maybe you want to run a splitter
up here to the top fans or maybe front
intakes and then maybe down here for you
know anything from SSDs to other fans to
LED strips your chassis is whatever it
might be
are those both 12-volt yeah these are
standard four pin 5050 you're good to go
they're on the memory side this is just
like those other boards they fully
support up to 3200 base speeds and
frequencies you're good to go and this
pretty much like all the other boards
that we talked about in terms of the e
source or sink support is also expanded
to any type of accessory that plugs into
the board so well that's gonna be
graphics cards memory or anything else
like that
speaking of memory I just don't out
memories are important with resin I've
talked about this many times on the
channel and getting faster memory is a
great way to get the most out of your
rising configuration and one thing I
always point to is once you've chosen
your motherboard and go check the qvl
list the actual memory that the
manufacturer has tested and asus does a
really good job testing lots of
different options they're gonna find a
huge range of kits that they've tested
they've confirmed it yes this works with
Raven H or the APS or what have you and
you know you can plug it in set up the
XMP values and you're good to go
yeah and to your point on the execute
values just like we talked about with
the other boards this offers the same do
CPU memory profiling options so you can
just go into you if I and set that
in addition to this this board does have
some nice upgrades we've got dual MDOT
two on this motherboard as composed to
the other boards which only have a
single end up to slot so if you want to
be able to go into that higher-end kind
of raid type configuration options you
do have available that you do all have
full support for CPU nvme base raid
configurations here also so definitely a
little bit more tuned towards that kind
of higher-end audience okay now as we
move into some of the other upgrades as
well I think some of the targeted areas
that really kind of uplift the board um
is going to be on the audio section so
this board features supreme effects
audio so this is a significant upgrade
compared to what we had on the primer of
the TUF so when we jump over to pretty
much the highest end chips that you can
get the S 1220 that's gonna be much much
better performance for to channel for
multi-channel as well as line level
input so some people use on microphone
so use an analog microphone here the
line in performance on the 12 to 20 is
much better than it is on like the 800
series chipsets so if you're gonna game
in stream or whatever anyone have nice
crisp clear audio from your mic yeah and
in addition to that we also do have an
extensive software suite we call it
Sonic studio sonic studio allows you to
go in and make customization per
applications per games - everything from
you know different types of frequency
spectrum if you want to do voice vocal
enhancement if you wanna do bass
improvement if you want to add
multi-channel audio but we also do have
post-processing for the microphone so
incoming audio as well as outgoing audio
we can apply post-processing filters to
kind of clean up noise or nd an
environment noise things like that so
there's a lot of kind of subtle things
that really help to improve the overall
experience whether it's gonna be you
know music movies games whatever it
might be you also do have improved audio
grade components on here so you have to
a degree capacitors but you also have
operational amplifiers in there that
pretty much squarely just gives you
better dynamic range higher volume
levels as well as the ability better to
drive higher-end headphones
okay so that's gonna be for the front
headphone and for line level out so both
of those are gonna be covered and ice is
their impedance level for headphones
yeah it is support up to 600 but without
getting kind of too technical you know
headphone and Peeta's shouldn't always
squarely be looked at your voltage
actually that you're being able to
provide from the operational amplifier
is more critical okay and so really our
goal here is that is just trying to make
sure that we can provide a more powerful
delivery experience to the headphone
probably if you're going 600 ohms you
probably really actually have like an
outboard amplifier oscillating with it
that's really designed to
well suit that but I think a lot of
people feel lastly looking at this or
probably also looking at overclocking
probably more seriously they're probably
in that higher-end range of the risin
five verizon seven series part and here
we do have an upgraded vrm you can see
that we've got a much beefier two-stage
vrm heatsink it's gonna be able to be
more adequately cool and be able to
provide a better experience and this
board I know it's gonna have something
that you've used a lot for more boards
in the past with our auto tuning
technology and so if you want to be able
to go into the 5a optimization suite you
know click a couple of buttons to be
able to easily and effectively overclock
your system with full real time stress
testing this board has it for you so you
can very easily overclock your eyes in
series part even if you don't have any
knowledge to do so so really all the way
around big upgrades this one also does
step up to an Intel NIC with our packet
priority software gain first packet
priority software so you go ahead and
prioritize your streaming your gaming or
downloading your browsing whatever it
might be pretty much a lot of stuff
really baked into this board I really
think be able to offer you a very
high-end experience but without getting
too crazy the last thing I did want to
touch on this board before we give a
little bit of context to the Mini ITX
port or just come out which I'm sure a
lot of you guys know I'm interested is
you can do a little bit of a site
customization this will actually come
with two covers for the actual fch plate
right here ins here you can see we've
got kind of a colored cover plate and
there we've got kind of the more
stealthy kind of matte black cover plate
so the choice is up to you depending on
how you want the board to kind of look
and feel your embrace
whether you embrace or reject RGB
exactly the choice is up to you cool
alright so 430 dollars that's a very
nice set of features and of course
overclocking like just and just like
that you can overclock with all these
boards now you mentioned a mini ATX
version yep and I think with the mini
ITX that's gonna be the Strix before 50
- I gaming that's gonna come in at just
about $150 and it's gonna pretty much
have every single thing that we talked
about here including the dual m2u so
it's got an N dot - that's on the front
of the board it's actually in our audio
riser card and then there's gonna be an
MDOT - that's gonna be on the back of
the board um it has illuminated actually
RG RGB audio outputs on the back of the
board which is something you've seen
like on a higher importance it upgrades
to this board and that it has an
addressable header and a standard legacy
RGB header and you're also have the full
audio design that we talked about is
also going to be on that mini ITX board
and it's also got a very solid and
robust vrm with a good quality PR me in
sync design so pretty much the only
thing that you would
we'll be missing between the - F and the
- I is gonna be the additional PCIe
expansion but otherwise all the really
great things that we talked about and
proved audio networking the fan controls
that we also touched on previously for
the prime boards are all here in terms
of you know temperature input mapping
for the CPU for the GPU or for different
temperature sources all that stuff is on
e or even our quick diagnostic LEDs you
know we didn't touch on that too much
but in the higher-end space I think you
can get sometimes more complicated
builds so it still sometimes nice to be
able to see a little four point LED for
the CPU the memory the graphic card or
the boot device and it will light up to
let you know if you may have an issue so
all that is gonna be baked on into
either one of these boards if you want
to go for the really cool small
form-factor build or I am build like
this one you're good to go
awesome and I have you personally used
the X 470 version of the Mini ITX which
is very similar to the B 450 version and
it's just amazing how much actual
hardware is packed into that little
seven inch by seven inch board but guys
that is pretty much gonna wrap it up for
this video JJ thank you so much for
stopping by today awesome to be here and
if you guys have any questions comments
feedback specifically these a suit
boards I'll definitely be checking out
the comments I'll try to respond to you
there and if you guys have any feedback
on designs features functions anything
you'd like to see in the next generation
series of motherboards for Macy's make
sure to let us know but definitely I
like to take that feedback back and talk
to our product design team and see what
we can't do for you guys alright well
I've made JJ suffer enough in my garage
where it's getting steadily warmer as
the Sun continues to bake us so we're
gonna cut off this video thank you guys
so much for watching hit the thumbs up
button if you did enjoy it and check
links in the video description down
below where I will link to these boards
as well as some other fun stuff that you
might be interested in thanks you guys
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
