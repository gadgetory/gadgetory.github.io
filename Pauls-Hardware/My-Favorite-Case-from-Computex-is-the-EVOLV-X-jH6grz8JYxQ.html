to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake hey guys I'm over
at fantex their suite at the Hyatts it's
wonderful in here because it's quite
beautiful
anyway they actually have a brand new
series of cases so this is metallic gear
natal gear powered by fan text so it's a
secondary brand and they have simplified
the design somewhat in order to make
these a little bit more affordable
depending on who you are of course price
ranges here are gonna be from $99 down
to about $60 this is sort of the
higher-end range of these cases and they
said they have more planned in the
series so let's take a look actually
quick correction $70 up to $100 so $100
for the full size Neo right here $85 for
the Neo micro $70 for the Neo mini and
then $80 for that special edition Neo
mini down on the end so let's start over
here with the Neo these all have a
fairly similar design so they can redo
the tooling in order to keep
manufacturing costs down and that's how
they keep your knees a bit affordable
but they still have all the high quality
fantex materials that you've come to
expect if you're familiar with fantex
mainstream series
it's an extruded anodized aluminum top
and front the front just pops off in a
very similar way that you might be
familiar with like the end to evolve and
on the side over here we've got a couple
USB 3.0 ports as well as a mic and
headphone jack there's also a reset
button nestled right over there and then
your power button is right up here on
top next to that is an RGB single button
control so you can cycle through some
basic RGB LED effects next up is the Neo
micro and you might notice this is just
a little bit shorter than the full-size
Neo this is a micro ATX case and I'm
liking that we have a few new selections
of micro ATX cases here at Computex
pretty much the same configuration for
i/o as well as materials as well as well
as color options here but also wanted to
point out and this is the same layout as
the full-size one down on the bottom
there isn't a power supply basement but
there's a tray across it there's a
couple SSD mounts for 2.5 inch drives
right there and then they've done a
screen on the tempered glass aluminum
side panel and that's to help block off
and give these sort of illusion of a
power supply basement down there at the
bottom so you can keep your build nice
and clean as pointing out that if you
actually put some RGB stuff down there
it might even shine through and give a
maybe a cool effect as you can possibly
see some of these RGB LED fans
on the Neo Mini neo many is many ITX as
the name might imply and for this one
they have flipped the power supply they
brought it up to the top but once again
if you are ashamed of your power supply
it's a hidden buy some of that
silkscreen effect on the side and this
is sort of the design IP that they've
gone with for the Metallica Gear brand
as for radiator support you can do a 280
or 240 in the front of the neo or the
neo micro the neo mini can support a 240
in the front or as you can maybe see on
this special version the Neo Geo mini it
also has ventilated side panels so if
you want you can do a two hundred eighty
millimeter radiator and have it facing
outward like this one the Neo Geo mini
is a little bit flashier version of the
neo mini as you can see it's got
tempered glass on the front with that
same screened design on it still has the
same top mounted power supply but this
one also comes with an actual PCIe
extension cable this one's gonna be $80
so just about ten dollars more than the
70 dollar neo Mini and the fact that
they've included a PCIe riser at this
price is actually pretty impressive you
might also notice that it has vertical
mounts they're not horizontal mouth so
it does appear that you would need that
riser in order to mount your graphics
card and over here on the other side of
this week we have the evolve X so the
end of the hole it's been a very popular
case from fantex aluminum top very
distinct look um they introduced some
really cool features like the ability to
easily pop off the front and side panels
plugs but they said they got some
feedback from people but the airflow was
not the greatest so this has some
various upgrades but the main one is
going to be that they've vastly
increased the airflow according to them
three times the amount of intake air
flow five times more surface exhaust
area as well so that's gonna be good for
radiators that might need to exhaust a
lot of heat out of the case you'll
probably pretty quickly notice that
they've added some ventilation along the
top that's gonna be helpful and then the
front panel here they basically just
given more space and provided additional
gaps for air to flow back in there you
might also notice that they've added
addressable RGB LED strips going down in
front as well as going going down the
bottom left side and they were
specifically trying to get lots and lots
of different LEDs in the strip so you
had a nice smooth transition between
them and I can see any any little points
of light particularly the side strip
here on the power supply Bay I think
really nice and really clean creator
support is pretty flexible you can do
140 millimeter fans or 120 millimeter
fans and you have the ability to do 3
140 s plus 2 140 s at the same time or
you can do 360 plus 360 if you want to
do 3 by 120 in both the front and the
top we're maintaining and flexibility
internally so not only do you have your
standard per se expansions but they've
got a three slot expansion there towards
the back and by adding a riser cable you
could bring a graphics card over there
intentionally made it three so that you
could position a two slot graphics card
a little bit further away from the
tempered-glass side window in order to
give yourself a little bit more
ventilation the front panel pops off
very easily just like the predecessor
and behind there is a magnetic dust
filter going the entire length of where
your intake fans would be at the top is
the i/o and you do have a USB 3.0 a
couple of those as well as a Type C port
that is a 3.1 type C port and the cable
length I'm told is short enough that you
can reach it to the motherboard and
still get USB 3.1 speeds opposite side
panel here also has tempered glass so
they wanted to make sure that you can
keep your table cable management's tidy
or at least visually appealing without
having to actually do a lot of efforts
so there's two internal swing doors that
will also swing out so their cable
management covers and not only do they
cover your cables so you don't have to
worry quite as much about cable
management but they also have SSD mounts
on them so those combined with the SSD
mounts that are actually on the back of
the motherboard tray means you can fit
up to nine SSDs in this case or nine 2.5
inch drives and of course the ones
behind the doors you would that's where
you would put your ugly SSDs and then
you're pretty SSDs would go on the
mounts that you can actually see through
the tempered glass side panel just cuz
the covers are here though doesn't mean
that they haven't paid attention to
cable management they still have to
cable management channels going down
behind that love to cover but they've
also improved the velcro straps so they
just slip over a hook so you know I can
actually have to feed them through a
little hole or something like that which
can be a pain in the butt sometimes so
just drop them over the hook cables down
there tend them down and it will keep
things nice and clean we're expecting
this to be available in August and it's
going to only cost you 199 dollars which
is only $10 more than the existing and
to evolve so that's that's a that's only
a very small premium for the additional
features the additional airflow the
addressable RGB LEDs on the front
as well as a power supply basement done
at the bottom but that's not all let's
take a look at these actual demo units
that they've put together over here just
to show some typical use case scenarios
now I know you're probably looking at
this system and you're like you know
that's water-cooled it's old news I've
seen water cooling before now this is
this is like a really epic nicely put
together water-cooled build they using
fantex particle components in there but
just just a very pretty looking
water-cooled build so you can see you
got plenty of space up front
even with radiators in the front and the
top and this is showing the 3-1 40s in
the front and the 2-2 80s in the top so
tons of heat dissipation even if you got
a two-way configuration going on and
they're also using a fan Tech's water
cooling parts for the blocks so really
nice but this also lets me point out a
couple other cool features if you remove
the top panel there is a radiator
bracket and they've made it a bit
simpler to remove with just a couple
thumb screws and they've added a fill
port at the top which is very important
for doing maintenance down the line
after you're primo chill view fluid does
something funky HBU fluid doesn't always
do funky stuff but it is important to
drain and flush your loop and clean it
out on a regular basis if you're doing a
high-end water-cooled build like this
especially if you're using colored fluid
but they've also added a drain ports and
you can't see right here but I do have
some video of it it's down in the front
at the very bottom so if you think ahead
plan ahead you can put a little valve
down there and you can drain at the
lowest point in the system from the
front and you can access that of course
just by popping off the front panels so
very thoughtful for water cooling
support but that's not all over here
though we can see the lighter silver
finish that they're also working on for
the evolved X and this is actually an
all-out storage build the evolved X will
ship with four of these 3.5 inch caddies
and they can stack on top of each other
and they can also fit in with the
bracket at the back so so it's going to
come with four caddies and they have
added four more so you can see six
drives right here going down the front
of the case and then down in the
basement so they have added two more so
that's a total of 8 3.5 inch drives
there for storage but that's not all I
mean of course there's the rest of the
system here which has a water-cooled
all-in-one as well as some cool-looking
xpg memory as well as of course that's
vertically mounted GPU but on the back
where I already showed you all of those
SSD mounts they've mounted up nine SSDs
so just insane amount of storage here
but even
all those SSDs back there there's a ton
of wiring going on but thanks to the
cable management's covers it's still
looking very clean so if you need an
all-out storage build like it's not just
for water cooling you can you can set up
something like this too but that's not
all
one more accessory here and this is a
mini ITX bracket so mini ITX support for
a mini ITX motherboard there's an i/o
panel too for the i/o to go out of and
it also integrates a power button so you
can actually press the power button
enter a mini ITX system on they've
integrated this with the fantex
power supply accessory that allows you
to connect two systems to one power
supply and control them individually so
even though there's only one power
supply mount on this case down at the
bottom at the back they have connected
up both systems to this and it's up in
the top it's like it's on the ceiling
it's like we've gone into bizarro world
and the computers on the ceiling it's a
very strange but even with that they've
added a whole 120 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler to it and you might notice
that there's also three graphics cards
in here so the back system has a 2-way
SLI configuration and they've used a
very long pci express riser cable to go
from that top system all the way down to
the back and around here so this
vertically mounted GPU is actually the
graphics card for that uh persistent so
you got two pretty powerful gaming
systems here in one case all powered by
one power supply but guys that is all
the time i have here at the fantex suite
so there are a few more products they
have a few new power supplies that work
on as well as a prototype P 600 s over
here but if you guys didn't already see
it check out the harbor connects video
on that because they took a look at that
it's it's it's pretty promising I think
it's got some potential there but that's
all for this video I would like to say a
huge thank you to my sponsors for
Computex 2018 team group gigabytes
Thermaltake and Coolermaster hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and subscribe because i have lots
more copy text videos coming at you very
soon for now i'm gonna go get some food
I'm super hungry but see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
