hardware my name is Paul this is my
channel false hardware and theoretically
my channel is all about computer parts
Hardware reviews overviews unboxings but
if you've been watching my channel up
till now you might have noticed that
there hasn't been a whole lot of that
going on but my aim is to remedy that to
that end I have my first Hardware review
that's going to be on this Asus Matrix
HD 7970 platinum video card a few
reasons why I chose this one first off I
had it available second off AMD just
recently released the catalyst 13.1
drivers those are the latest wickel
certified drivers as compared to the
12.10 which were out prior to now so I
have reminisce card benchmarks with the
newer drivers as well as the older
drivers beginning guys a little bit of
comparison for that also well I've got
all this issue stuff I got my shirt see
rog shirt I got my Asus laptop in case
you're wondering no this video is not
sponsored by Asus but I do enjoy their
hardware so let's go ahead and jump
right into it and we'll start off with a
quick look at these specs so here's a
comparison of the specs and bear in mind
there are a few different versions of
the 7970 that are out there you can tell
based on the GPU code name so there's
the original 7970 that was codenamed
Tahiti XT and then they came out with
the 7970 gigahertz edition that's the
Tahiti XT 2 version so the matrix here
is based on the Tahiti XT 2 or the Sony
970 gigahertz Edition and then if you're
looking at the frequency therefore the
GPU at least the 7970 original ran at
925 megahertz the 7970 gigahertz Edition
it runs at 1050 and the matrix sonja at
70 platinum runs at 1104 memory that's
one of the other differences here they
all have a three gigabyte memory frame
buffer however the original 79 so many
of the memory was running at 1375 or
5500 affected 7970 gigahertz Edition
runs at 1500 megahertz so that's 6000
effectively and then the matrix they
cranked it all the way up to 1600 and 50
megahertz and that gives you an
effective memory clock of 6600
which is pretty crazy apart from that
most of the other specs are the same and
the other differences come down to the
custom core as well as the
custom-designed PCB so now I've written
down the specs
sicko clueless oh look at what this card
is all about now that we have a full
video on this card and unboxing an
overview where I talk about all of the
fancy features that are included I'm
going to point out just a few of them
here while I give you guys a closer look
but this is just a beautiful card as you
can see they have a full back plate on
the back the entire board here is custom
design so whenever AMD comes out with a
video card or GPU such as a 7970 they'll
have a reference design for the board
Asus threw all that away they started
from scratch they built their own so
that they can position everything where
they most wanted it to be positioned
they also did this so that they could
really really beef up the VRMs the power
delivery for the GPU they've done some
really cool work such as underneath here
so you can see you've got this black bar
here with some of their heavier cards
they've had issues in the past with drew
page that means when the card is
actually plugged in let's flip it around
to the way it would be position the
cards actually plugged in right there
this it's so it can be so heavy that it
will actually start to droop put some
added pressure on the PCI Express slot
that you have it plugged into and that's
a bad thing so what they've done here is
they really added a ton more rigidity to
the card and so they have these just
really big black beefy component going
down the entire thing comes up here and
actually makes contact with the PCB this
is where you I'm sorry with the PCI
bracket this is where you bolt that in
so that's gonna be super sturdy right up
against that you also have some cool
stuff like the matrix logo up here at
the top this is going to light up
different colors depending on the load
that's on the card you've got stuff like
specific voltage read points scattered
throughout so if you're gonna really be
overclocking the card you can get your
multimeter in there get your voltage
readings to a pins PCI Express power
connectors there so plenty of power you
have a bios switch right here so this is
going to switch between two different
bios actually v bios settings to set you
up for five or six way eyefinity output
via all of the display outs at the back
so it's going to change one of these two
dual link or single link I forget which
one is which right off the bat but I
think it actually says yeah single link
single link dual link you can switch
them though so you can actually push six
monitors from the single card these also
don't want to come
wait wait there we go alright so there's
your two DVI connectors so two DVI
connectors for full-size DisplayPort
connector so it's another huge feature I
really like a lot of 7970 s have the
little mini DisplayPort connectors this
one's got full-size ones no need to buy
extra adapters of the card brands cool
though and all of my benchmarks and
you'll be shown you'll be taking a look
at those in just a second
I think the hottest it got was in the
mid 60's which is really cool for 7970
especially an overclocked one just like
this it's by virtue of the three slot
cooler it's giving a lot more thermal
mass here to help dissipate the heats
you've also got some cool features here
like a hundred percent fan button I
pushed that fans go to hundred percent
really helps with benchmarking you can
cool the card off very quickly so you
can reset to default and jump up to do
some more benchmarks you got LED
readouts right there for the load on the
card got plus and minus indicators right
there too for over volting I think those
will do 0.125 increments millivolt
increments so you can just bump up or or
back off the voltage just by the buttons
on the card you also have a safe mode
button so if you are doing overclocking
push that button sets back to default
suspects and you can save yourself if
you've gotten into a situation that
you're having a hard time getting back
out of but the benchmark should speak
for themselves so let's take a look at
those I'm showing you a few comparisons
here I'm going to be comparing this to
another high-end 1797 that's at 7970 X
but H is also comparing this card to
itself running both 1210 and the 13.1
drivers then I'm also going to be
throwing in a GTX 680 bear in mind
that's a reference design GTX 680
running at stock frequencies here's the
benchmark
so there you have it guys my benchmark
comparison comparing the ITO about ten
divers with the 13.1 drivers also doing
a couple more points of comparison there
for you guys as well I guess this is the
point in a review where I give my final
thoughts so let's see first off I should
develop some sort of scoring system so
that I can give sort of relative
performance indicators for all the
hardware that I review but since this is
the first one and there's no real point
for comparison I'm just gonna leave it
pretty generic this is a really really
really good card it's also a premium
card so bear that in mind this is a
platinum version these are harder to
find if you don't have the cash for
platinum version or if you can't find
one there is a non platinum version the
only real difference between those is
that this one is gonna be running at
eleven hundred megahertz out of the box
the non platinum runs at ten fifty and
really you can take the non platinum
version it could overclock it
these are definitely gonna overclock the
best so if you really want to take a
video card see what kind of performance
you can get out of it the Platinum
Edition have cherry-picked GPUs they're
always going to perform better because
Asus has tested those prior to releasing
the card to verify that yes these are
the GPUs we can push really far and the
lemon are domakr it's one from this one
by the way it's kind of the baseline
that's the starting out point you can
really push it far past that and Asus
has integrated a lot of stuff to allow
you to do that it's a triple slot card
and I hear a lot of complaints about
triple slot cards and I'm not always
100% sure why they're pretty
straightforward about it because triple
slot cards the vast majority of people
who are building computers only use one
video card a very very few well not a
very very few but ace much smaller
number than that will run two cards
two-way SLI or crossfire X 3-way or
four-way is just such a small part of
the number of people who actually build
computers that it's really an area where
there is other hardware available for
that this is not designed for that
specific use and if you were going to do
something like that anyway you're
probably not going to go with
air-cooling if you're going with three
or four video card chances are you gonna
be going towards water cooling setup
you're gonna do a custom block on the
card it's going to be narrower by virtue
of that by itself so the the triple
slots
spaced cooler in this circumstance give
you much more thermal mass
allows the car to stay much cooler under
load it allows the fans to spin lower I
really have to point out that when I'm
testing cards especially higher in cards
you put them in and they start going and
they get really hot and the fans spin up
really loud it's such a distraction so
that's two things I really like about
this card it stays it stays cool and
quiet even under full load there is zero
and I mean zero coil wine or additional
noise from the components on this board
and if you've never experienced coil
whine wait until you do and it's really
bad and it's actually a situation that's
popped up with quite a few of some
matches of the 7000 series cards depends
really a lot on the hardware integrated
into the card itself can also depend on
the other component you're running such
as your power supply your motherboard
but this one none of that never made a
noise except for the sort of soft whoosh
of the fans spin so I hope that's good
enough the sort of review conclusion for
you guys really liked this card if you
got the money
go for it because to my knowledge thus
far it's the fastest single GPU card
that I've tested and I should point out
the huge caveat that my comparisons
today wear with a standard 680 running
at the stock frequency and I really have
not tested too many of those high-end
custom built 680 s yet but maybe soon
but that is gonna wrap it up for this
review guys I hope you've enjoyed this
has been my first one I'm still looking
the kinks out but you bring a more tuna
future once again this has been the Asus
matrix HD 7970 platinum video card I'm
