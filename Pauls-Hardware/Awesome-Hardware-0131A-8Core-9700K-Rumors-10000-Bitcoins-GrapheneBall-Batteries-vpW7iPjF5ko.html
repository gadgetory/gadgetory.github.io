down a bit
deep breath cleansing and an outs okay I
think we are ready to begin hello
everyone welcome to awesome hardware
this is a live show we stream to twitch
we stream to YouTube it's very
professional never interrupted there's
never any background noise but she's
only interrupt the show for something
really really important I don't know
where a bottle opener is we have a
bottle opener
what convenient product placement what
we need that she's stealing it my god
all right yeah I divorce hi everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware so yeah we
stream a live show we talk about
technology but drink some beer
occasionally we use foul language it's
of course tastefully done but just bear
that in mind occasional adult themes but
mostly mostly talk about technology
beyond that we're streaming the first
half of this episode which is 131 to my
channel paul sartre we're in about an
hour we'll switch over to Kyle's channel
that link to that videos in this video's
description as well as links to all of
the various topics that we're going to
talk about today first topic selling
stuff if you'd like to help support our
channels the content that we make and
also get yourself some swiggy swag check
out our stores you can snap pulsar
Burnett check out key cash I use I need
to get my hands on these these just came
in we got to put the pulse hardware
thumbscrew logo right there on the key
cap beautiful I write I recommend buying
a hundred and eight of them and
replacing every single key on your email
that's a good that's a good not fit
their standard cherry in work with
standard Cherokee do you have like a set
like a combo set but if you could get a
discount if they buy like that's so new
it's so new right now Kyle that we have
not even contemplated anything remotely
close to that beyond that though it
really bugs in playing going to be a
really small space bar - I've got to say
on somebody's there's only a few of
these hoodies left over they're on sale
by the way guys so if you need something
to keep you warm for the winter check
them check them out
cow stories bit wit backslash store yep
anything new kal anything like keycaps
no I don't have any cool keycaps Paul
but now I feel like you know as always I
have to step it up step up my game we do
got a sale and add some bringing key
caps to the store with my logo light up
light of crystal RGB stones well you
know heist I almost you know Dovan in on
the fidgets spinner thing we need when
you had them yeah I'm yeah but you know
what that I left it to you the fad is is
over but see I struck when the iron was
hot yeah like I never liked a lot of
them I was only planning to buy one
batch and just sell out of them almost
immediately because I knew like it was
trending at the moment I mean your
profit margin was so ridiculous on those
anyway it was ridiculous they were like
yeah you know like five cents each you
know I'm just gonna I don't know much
they were about a member but they're
probably like not not a lot but people
were happy with them people were all
right Rick shoutouts to sell for being
our mod and being awesome thank you so
much so wifey sauce is also I believe in
there mati ex-wife you just drinking a
beer with us
speaking of beer Cheers thanks I guess
gin here
drinkin subsea Nevada right now some pol
holiday haze IPA it's quite nice in a
moment we're gonna move on to this this
is from a fan sent in by a fan yes I
opened this on mail time if you want to
send us go
peel box is done in the description this
is fram fram somebody crafted humbly
offered it's from Hood River Oregon
organ yeah and you're supposed to enjoy
it forty to forty five degrees
Fahrenheit are we meeting that 45 summer
pails brilliant blonde color doesn't
help you enjoy summer its aromas of
peaches citrus and strawberries with
notes of nectarines grapefruit spice and
oats
I'm measuring the ambient not let's say
if if the color doesn't help you enjoy
summer all of the aromas of summer will
and we're not even of course drinking
this winter that's right we must fight
the winter I can enjoy beer at all
seasons alright our first segment
today's show is net watch and Baywatch
but let's doing this at the beginning of
the show when we've only just started
drinking I'm excited about that because
I can hopefully discuss this subject
with some degree of fluency first stop
if you aren't familiar with net
neutrality it's the basic concept that
all of the data transferred over the
Internet should be treated equally and
your internet service provider whoever
you pay for your connection to the
Internet be it Comcast or Verizon or
whatever else shouldn't be able to treat
traffic from one website differently
from then traffic from another website
it's a pretty basic concept right now
the FCC is pretty much poised to strike
down with a current framework that
upholds the FCC's ability to enforce net
neutrality and December 14th they're
actually probably going to vote to get
rid of it now there's a big hubbub of
course going on on the internet about
that because people like net neutrality
they want to keep it there is of course
discussion as to how it should be
enforced but our stance and the stance
of most of the people who I discussed
this with just after looking at the
facts is that they'd rather the FCC not
do what they're about to do so all that
said some more details on this ongoing
saga as we approach the dreaded date
when they will actually do that other
things that they're doing on top of
these net neutrality rules is scrapping
plans ordering States to scrap plans for
their own net neutrality laws and this
is one of those issues that's going
along with net neutrality is the fact
that like a lot of people would be ok
with the markets like a standard market
approach to this like oh you have a
bunch of choices and if they do crappy
things like throttling one website or
the other just choose a different
internet service provider the problem
with over 50% of Americans is you only
have one choice yeah you can't switch so
if they start screwing around you really
have nothing there's nothing that you're
able to do which is why the customer
service is so shit it's why the customer
service sucks it's why internet service
provider providers as larger than most
hated companies in the United States and
when you see the FCC going along with
what Internet service providers have
been doing when it comes to actually
going against
other the introduced introduction of
competitions that's what this is so if
states decide that you know once the FCC
scraps the current title two rules for
Internet Service Providers states might
go ahead and go their own way and be
like right we as a state you're going to
write up some laws in the state that say
you can't do this or this when it comes
to treating network traffic in our
state's but the FCC is saying no no no
you can't do that because that's our
role our role is the FCC because the
Internet is nationwide is to enforce
this type of thing therefore you can't
do that
so so you're in the position it's like
well then can you enforce that
neutrality like no we're gonna roll it
we're gonna roll that back yeah so it's
a little it's a little frustrating when
you look at it this way because you're
like all right like introduce a bunch
introduce a bunch of rules of like force
there to be competition like you Alma
you always must have four choices for
your internet service provider and then
sure you're gonna have one that says hey
we're gonna not gonna block any
everything everyone's going to sign up
for them and yeah that's how the market
works but when you're in a situation
that is due to other other reasons
limited when it comes to competition
then you're in the situation you have
right now this is according to the
article from ARS technica a victory for
broadband providers that asks for
widespread preemption of state laws Ajit
PI's proposal or proposed to order finds
that state and local laws must be
preempted preempted if they conflict
with the US government's policy of
deregulating broadband internet service
the extent to which this would take
effect isn't clear it would prevent
States from imposing net neutrality laws
similar to the ones being repealed by
the FCC so they're like okay we're
repealing this nationwide and that guy
can we put that back on a state level no
you can't do that either but it also
potentially prevents state laws related
to the privacy of Internet users or
other consumer protections so there's
some other wide part of reaching
implications of this there's further
updates to sort of net neutrality and in
general because Ars Technica isn't a
bunch of reporting on this further down
in the article for instance some other
details about the rules as people
looked into them a bit more clear a bit
more detailed it says that they
requiring I'm sorry the previous rules
that required Internet service providers
to disclose hidden fees and data caps
getting rid of those like oh yeah
Jesus the rules were like hey you know
you got to tell consumers when you're
gonna do like anti-consumer practices
and you got to tell them how much you're
going to charge them and you're going to
tell them about data caps no that's not
going to be enforced anymore so more
more wonderful news there the FCC will
relinquish its role in evaluating
whether ISPs can charge competitors for
data cap exemptions and will no longer
oversee interconnection disputes that
harm Internet service quality so these
are basically things that the FCC does
so that if somebody a customer says hey
FCC this my internet service provider is
doing things that are in conflict with
the rules that breaking the rules the
FCC is like oh that's not our job
anymore so they're basically pushing
this move to sort of create a hands-off
environment at a Content EC or some
different the FCC's completely hands-off
and the ISPs can just run around and do
whatever the fuck they want yes
now this proposal does add one new
requirements and this is what they're
leaning on as far as their explanation
of why this is okay and the new
requirement is that internet service
providers will have to make public
disclosures if they engage in blocking
or throttling of Internet contents and
they will have to disclose deals to
prioritize content from affiliates or
content from companies that pay ISPs for
priority access and make no mistake if
net neutrality is overturned this is
exactly what is going to happen you're
gonna see throttling of Internet content
you already started to see that back in
anywhere from 2007-2008 to all the way
up to 2015 when title 2 was made a thing
or when is piece were classified its
title 2 so when this happens all they
gotta do is tell you disclose to you and
you know how good large corporations
especially Internet service providers
are being perfectly clear with people
about extra fees and that kind of thing
so I'm sure it won't be like in fine
print or something like that or you know
otherwise obfuscated so it's difficult
to actually determine how much money
we'll be paying for your internet
package which gives you access
to the small slice of the internet
service of the internet that your ISP
wants to give you access to I mean let's
just fucking move at this point no Kyle
that's not the answer yeah that's not
the answer it's my thank you have to
stand up and fight here's another
glorious thing AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast lawsuits
which has nullified a city's broadband
competition law this is in Nashville
Tennessee and they had a utility pole
ordinance which was invalidated by a
judge this is just yesterday or today I
believe and that judge was convinced by
AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast to do so
the Nashville Metro Council last year
passed a one-touch make ready rule that
gives Google Fiber or other new Internet
service providers access to utility
poles because in the past they would
actually have to work with the existing
incumbent providers like 18 Comcast
they'd have to wait for them to send a
tech out at the same time and I bet
they're super excited to do that and
they are probably very timely with
scheduling that type of thing
considering that it's assisting the
competitor and getting up and running
but let's face it
developing competition when it comes to
something like becoming an Internet
service provider this is why a lot of
the this goes back to the foundation of
the problem which is that it doesn't
make sense to go into a neighborhood and
wire it up 20 different times for 22
different internet service providers
they have to share some of the same
utilities from time to time and how
that's done can be regulated in
different sorts of ways this regulation
before it being overturned would let a
single company make all the necessary
wire adjustments on those utility poles
AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast
of course sued the judge agreed with
them and now you can't do that anymore
Google Fiber is rolling out service in
Nashville they're offering service
despite saying last year that it was
waiting for access to thousands of these
utility poles and this is yet another
example of large incumbent Internet
service providers doing everything they
can to prevent competition so give us
one option or another allow competition
and allow it flourish or succumb to the
basic rules of net neutrality and follow
those rules so you're not screwing with
traffic one way or another like
you know there are arguments to be made
it's like you know if you have a utility
like compared to other utilities that
are titled to look at water and power
your water power company and your power
company you do not tell you what to do
with your water and your power they just
give it to you that's basically how it
should work and you know a lot of the
time you only have one option for water
and power but that's why it's regulated
by the government is because when you
only have one option the sort of
capitalist system doesn't really work
there
hey I'm getting an amusing too many
buzzwords and people going to start
arguing in the comments let's move on I
see Pi in the FCC you want it to be
legal for Comcast to block BitTorrent
this is what got him in trouble in the
first place
blocking BitTorrent but it's sort of
been up in the air like what do they
really think what's really the
fundamental idea like like if you
fundamentally believe net neutrality
should be a thing or not like it's kind
of the question I ask people when I when
it when it when discussing this if they
really have a full understanding of what
it is if you look at the actual text of
the rule that's being proposed first off
the G PI makes it clear that he thinks
it's a mistake for the FCC it thinks it
was a mistake I mean that's pretty
obvious already for the FCC to try and
stop Comcast from blocking BitTorrent it
back in 2008 which the FCC did that was
under what's known as light touch rig
the light touch regulation period and
they tried to say hey you can't do that
and the you know supposed to be like
touch they say hey you can't do that but
instead Comcast was like actually no
we're gonna sue you
we're gonna sue you because we don't
think you're allowed to enforce this
this is what kicked off the entire
debates and which ended up in 2015 with
net neutrality being enforced so
literally part of the proposal and it's
highlighted in this article from the
verge the various statements that are
just very clear about the 2008 Comcast
BitTorrent order and that the Commission
sought to enforce federal internet
policy and that in 2010 the US Court of
Appeals for the DC Circuit rejected the
Commission's action holding that the
Commission had not justified its action
as valid exercise of ancillary authority
that's what caused them to push for
title 2 classification
so the Internet freedom NPRM proposed to
eliminate the internet context on
standard and the non exhaustive list of
factors intended a guide application
that rule also saw comments on whether
to keep modifier eliminates bright-line
conduct and transparency rules anyway so
this is just a little bit more evidence
of exactly exactly the intents a veggie
pie and what they're doing right now
and let's round out a net watch with a
little bit of actual good news you got
to go global for this but India has net
neutrality well they're working on
they're pushing towards it according to
this article they're miles ahead of the
US with it's ironclad net neutrality
rules that's a little bit of an
overstatement if you read the article
itself but the Telecom Regulatory
Authority of India tra I published its
recommendations for upholding that
neutrality guidelines
today they are pro-consumer rules that
actually enforce net neutrality it's
recommended that isp should adhere to
the principle of non discriminatory
non-discriminatory treatments of
contents no blocking or throttling of
content no fast lanes for content
services that offer to pay for the
privilege with an exclusion for content
delivery networks also the agency has
suggested the creation of a committee
consisting of representative ISPs
content providers and its consumer
groups to police net neutrality
violations across the country which
sounds reasonable representation from
the industry who's providing the service
representation from the customers who
are being provided that service
representation from the regulators
talked about things but you have a basic
established set of rules that say net
neutrality is part of the rulebook and
that's how the internet works we should
thank you so yeah the u.s. is on the
verge of destroying that reality India
is on the verge of making it law if you
want a little bit more history from
India and sort of what the what's going
on as far as them and the Internet in
general a couple years back 2015-2016
Facebook was trying to go into India and
provide them with free internet suck
when in there is like hey India I am
I'm suck Facebook
suck let's give you let's give you
Internet India we're gonna invest a
bunch of money and infrastructure and
give India Internet but it wasn't gonna
be the internet it was gonna be Facebook
and Facebook it's basically the Facebook
Internet is what was gonna be accessed
yeah Facebook provided so there was a
lot of argument about that and people
saying like oh it's a good thing they're
gonna provide internet to more people
but ultimately you can't have internet
that's just solely controlled by a
single a single company right like that
it's just too much control over it and
when that is the the pipe that's
providing the information to people
there's just too many ways that it can
be corrupted and abused so yeah there
you go
you suck suck yeah you suck Zak what do
you suck off if you guys are interested
in doing something if you are voting age
granted if you're below voting age speak
out spread information be positive tweet
it be understanding talk to people
explain things don't yell at them don't
get good don't get angry don't don't go
after as you PI's kids apparently
there's like some people go after his
kid don't do that that's gonna really
know what's oh oh shit you're talking to
my kids all right fine net neutrality
here you go that's garbage that's never
gonna work just be reason don't be a
baby wannabes let me civilize this stuff
but anyway can kill observe will go to
bow for the Netcom and there's a pretty
good collection of information you can
enter your name and email address and
stuff and it will put you in contact
with your representative so you can get
in touch with let them know how you feel
about the issue there's also a link to a
whitehouse.gov petition that's being
signed right now called do not repeal
net neutrality currently that's about
two hundred thirty thousand signatures
it only needed a hundred K but go sign
this anyways because we want to get as
many cigs on there as possible so big
empowers would be hopefully know that
this is something that people feel
strongly about all right let's move on
geez thank you thank you now that we're
all depressed for X Paula this is real
for City go through my first segments
which I was trying to get the kind of
more serious stuff out of the way so we
can move on let's talk about I need
infinite beer this is supposed to be
cryptocurrency but I don't have a lot of
thirds for it so we're just calling us
win
that's just good but we're talking about
good to all winners
is this because this was the existing
it's lower there was a what existing
lower thirds that was there that I was
like that that kind of applies sure play
here's our winners okay say if you got a
bunch of bitcoins you're rolling rolling
the dough breaking it in Bitcoin is just
just teasing teasing $10,000 hey hitting
actually wait no right guys guys 10,000
right now I dollars thank you very much
you've heard it here first as of like an
hour or hour and a half ago was at
ninety nine fifteen we have cracked ten
thousand dollars everyone everyone go by
like 30 we have do we have a thing we
can do we're balloons fall down I'm
working on the confession there up with
the balloons an asylum that comes in
there will be a whole system yes ten
that reason thousands Wow Wow
what was it was it's like a year ago
let's let's take let's take a quick look
here like a thousand ah jumping around
but see as from my understanding the
more people who are mining the to
actually gain market share of Bitcoin so
please sorry no no what what are you
saying I was saying like the isn't the
way that the system works is the more
people who are mining the more difficult
it is to actually mine more coin is that
correct yeah well they difficulty
increases increase yeah it becomes more
more complex right as as coins remind so
does that mean as the value goes up the
and people are mining more you can't
actually mine as much per per period of
time it means that the amount of mining
power that you need to actually do
something grows more and more so so
you'll be mining less but if you'd never
upgrade your hardware or something like
that never increase the power efficiency
you'll be mining less and less and less
as the popularity of mining in zoos is
due to the due to the fact that for
Bitcoin first off it's the most popular
cryptocurrency and the most of all
but also there's tons of Asics that have
been developed so there's tons of coin
mining machines that are very power
efficient that have been produced that
and that's what's used to my Bitcoin
like right mining Bitcoin on anything
besides something like that really isn't
practical at all you know you're not
gonna make money because you won't be
you won't be paying for your electricity
cost or the cost of your hard work
that's why they have likes a giant like
global groups right like Bitcoin mining
groups yes yes so typically what people
do now is they mine altcoins other types
of coins and then they usually trade
that for Bitcoin and then they can cash
out the Bitcoin or do something like
that or they'll use Ceph software that
has a bunch of different coin mining
mining algorithms and the software will
look at currents pressure market prices
and I believe like the the mining power
of your system and then we'll we'll mine
whatever is most most profitable yeah so
that's another there Yap support you but
yeah you guys right over here first I'm
sure this is no nowhere else has this
been discussed yet it looks like as of
universal standard time what is that
1:30 UTC on Wednesday November 29th
Universal Time that's yeah add spinach
its Greenwich Mean Time hold low roll
gets its time from Greenwich Greenwich
gets its time from Admiral boom all
right yeah ten thousand forty three it
looks like who's gonna peep that it's
currently sitting at ten thousand forty
one see you all your bitcoins there I
believe I saw something somewhere about
some guy who at the beginning of this
year said if Bitcoin hit 10k he was
gonna like chop his balls off and eat
him or something like this there was
some insane thing like that but that
guy's gonna have to do that now I wish I
knew I wish I knew more specifically
what that was but I just said where's
the gold mask that should have been
right here in cryptocurrency I did see
that Elon Musk
talking about crypt about Bitcoin and
somebody asked him about it and he said
oh there was speculation that he was the
actual greeter of Bitcoin which is just
you know kind of crazy conspiracy theory
but yeah he said he said he had like
part of a Bitcoin at one point but he
doesn't know where it is anymore
like he lost it yeah
so that kind of made me think like how
many people lose bitcoins well
interestingly enough one fortune nearly
4 million bitcoins have been lost
forever 4 million bitcoins times $10,000
holy crap that's a lot of market cap day
so yeah this little chart kind of shows
bitcoins that are out of circulation as
far as doing due to being out of
circulation original coins that
apparently are all gone now
coins lost you to buy buying and selling
then of the coins mining in 9 - 2017 how
many are gone so an interesting little
church three point seven nine million
bitcoins are already gone based on a
highest estimate three two point seven
eight million based on at low one so 17
to 23 percent of existing bitcoins are
lost I thought it was kind of
interesting how the research which comes
from a company called chain alysus
actually goes down because you know if
you're trying to figure out about lost
bitcoins how do you how do you actually
figure that out yeah so a spokesperson
shared some certain details about how
they assist with how bitcoins are lost
and important clue comes when there is a
fork in the blockchain such as one the
summer which led to the creation of a
Bitcoin clone known as Bitcoin cash such
events can lead to the owners of wallets
who have been inactive for years to
conduct a transaction as that transfer
potentially happens providing an
opportunity for statistical analysis so
even though you might have a Bitcoin
wallet from like years back that hasn't
been touched or anything done with and
you don't know is that lost did whoever
owned that Bitcoin wallet lose the
information and they don't have the the
code for it anymore and they they just
can't access it so that's gone or do
they have it and they know about it and
they're watching this is like man I'm
gonna sit on this and eventually I'm
gonna do something with it so that's
part of how they get some this data to
determine how many bitcoins are actually
lost interesting getting a ping from
those wallets helps figure out the
biggest source of a certain uncertainty
as to whether they're lost or just being
hoarded now if you are into coin mining
your crypto currency which I'm not
really
to be clear here good some discussing it
here why is there we so come out of your
house I have a reasonable understanding
of this is Allah which I wouldn't
necessarily call myself an expert oh
yeah there is a theory that I actually
am a hardcore miner about that Paul's a
closet miner if that was true I would be
more excited about Bitcoin hating 10k
but what's gonna happen next is your
good actor who knows this is why I don't
play the stock market really first off a
negative story bubble fears stoked by a
spike in buy bitcoin with credit card
searches which is never a good thing um
you should never have people who are
like man I gotta get me into this
Bitcoin how do i buy some bitcoins on my
credit card that's that's not good
that's a signal that it's it's it's a
little bit people were a little
overzealous about how valuable these
things are and potentially a sign that
it's a bubble people over valuing it
which could potentially lead to a crash
yeah or or Bitcoin could easily hit
forty thousand dollars by the end of
2018 whole forty thousand dollars that
is almost that is a lot more than what
its of worth right now that's four times
worth I was made a stupid joke uh yeah
but yeah this hedge fund manager manager
Michael Novogratz who's a apparently
super hotshot hedge fund manager but
he's got lots of money
he actually suppose yeah he's he's
fairly well known for my understanding
but uh he said Bitcoin could be at forty
thousand dollars by the end of 2018 it
easily could I don't know what he's
backing this up on I'm sure his
incredible knowledge of the market and
whatever here's a video on fortune I
mean the websites called fortune go
there make money aetherium incidentally
also hit these which is the second
largest publicly traded cryptocurrency
by market cap hit a record-high four
hundred ninety three dollars and forty
cents on Monday which is down a little
bit now to 476
also Bitcoin has dropped six dollars
from one a little over a thousand forty
dollars down to one thousand thirty four
dollars everyone sell your bitcoins
let's move on that's next
the heck is next in security security oh
boy alright let's talk about some
security subjects thanks this is gonna
be exciting
first off Intel has found what they're
calling severe bugs in the secretive
management engine which is affecting
millions z net has has a video here I'm
gonna play on that it's something to
look at yeah this is a based on an
investigation by third-party researchers
and to their hidden firmware known as
management engine which is often used in
corporate environments for your your IT
to remote into your system and that kind
of thing but it has very low-level
access to the system there's actually a
separate coprocessor on systems that
have Intel management enabled that
handles it that operates separately
completely from like your main processor
and your operating system they
discovered these bugs after maxim gorky
and marc amiel of from the security firm
positive technologies found a critical
vulnerability in the management and
management engine firmware the Intel
NASA says would allow an attacker with
local access to execute arbitrary code
and since again it runs on that separate
code processor that runs a completely
separate from your processor or your
operating system it means it's invisible
to your CPU and any anti-malware
software that you might have so this is
a pretty serious and probably especially
in the corporate space is going to lead
to some some information security issues
in 2018 it's a good thing they caught
that before anybody did victims reported
attacks right I think it's a it's like I
feel like when when this type of thing
comes out it's like it probably already
happened like then you know yeah they
could just be being quiet as to not
encourage people but they don't want to
let everyone know how it actually is
yeah all right do any of you guys have a
Mercedes that has you don't oh really
that has keyless start like you don't
have like all you have to do is get in
the car with the key fob and they push a
button I didn't know they could do that
really I mean I did okay I'm emphasizing
how sometimes I'm not sure but yeah
here's a story from the UK across the
pond our Mercedes relay box or a relay
box was used to steal this Mercedes in
Solihull it's a relay buck so these two
dudes come operate there's a Mercedes a
balloon post one guy takes this box and
he goes up by the front door and he
starts waving it around
basically he's getting closer to the
door where the key fob is yeah picking
up a signal the the relatively weak
signal transmits up so I'm not
transmitting it over to this dude in one
minute
walks up does that gets into the car
starts up the car they take off car
still hasn't been found
what so yeah so he's using a relay yeah
what does a relay box usually used for
besides stealing cars I mean if you look
at it from a basic stamp like look at it
like a like a Wi-Fi extender or
something like that it's like something
that can take a signal pick it up and
then repeat it okay you know two
different reaction so yeah it's so using
its repeater amplify the signal from the
key fob and that's genius I'm gonna
steal like a hundred cars get in the car
yeah now what I'm not sure about it's
like it must it must also duplicate that
signal somehow because like if you get
out of a car that you started with that
it'll you should be like hey the keys
not in yeah the car's gonna turn off or
something like that so they that's
pretty fancy though it reminds me of
like the gun in 60 seconds or something
like that but yeah yeah what you already
do after they after they stop the car
and then they don't have the father
anymore I don't know I mean you're
talking about I don't know what kind of
Mercedes these is but usually just
ladies is gonna be sixty to a hundred
plus thousand dollars so yeah they
probably have some sort of thing that
they go through to like yeah I don't
know I don't like I feel like something
like this is the cars like tainted right
it's reported as stolen right VIN or
whatever that's flagged so
I don't know is there some black market
where you can get really cheap
Mercedes's as long as you never get
pulled over and listen is much more
viable than Bitcoin mining yeah that's
probably I am out why I brought it up
I'm gonna try that encourage people good
good alternative in smaller variable
alright so I'll give it a shot
face ID is a new way to unlock your
phone with the iPhone X and there's been
various we talked we've talked here
about some various efforts to crack it
because there's it does I don't know I I
feel like it's gone back and forth but
um there's a there's a a ten-year-old
who's a spitting image of his mom wait
really yeah
oh and ten-year-old is therefore being
pretty similar yeah I mean apparently
similar enough for the iPhone excitation
teacher he the phone is locked algorithm
isn't she like specific enough she looks
at it and it unlocks she's gonna lock it
again she's gonna hand it to the kid are
they a part of a company organization
it's just like mom and sawdust I figure
it's like just a random YouTube video by
a lifter mom and son have found this out
I was a kid takes the phone he looks at
it and it unlocks what any damage that
he dabs right after what a perfect way
to end the video there was an year-old
Debs after unlocking mom's iPhone with
face ID he got a lot of he got several
extra internet points for the bed but
there you go
so a face ID not completely foolproof
who knows how practical this is when it
comes to like you know if you have a
target and you need to get their iPhone
X in a market like if you're an evil
person or a thief or something which I
assume there's not many of watching our
show I don't know why I'm describe it
this way but Siri it seems less
practical for something like that but
definitely something you should keep in
mind if you're say a mom or a dad and
you think your phone is safe with your
kid cuz yeah they look like you a lot of
family resemblance you made the only you
created your own vulnerability how's
that feel
feels good lock them up and throw them
in a closet so good for a minute
all right that's for plowing through it
today we're a little bit late so I'm
trying and I'm trying to just you and
great just one happens only nine fifteen
ten you guys with the information
firehose
this is nine fifteen Wow look into my
bed late wrong o'clock all right so we
got just some standard tech news here
yes moving out to the regular neutrality
all right let's talk about some pcs
they're still exciting stuff to discuss
here we starting with some leaks about
Intel's eighth generation and ninth the
generation CPU lists so like this is
basically this came from a night at
sixty four update itis 64 had a late of
latest beta that went out and had a
bunch of information about or just that
you know the the specs for these CPUs
that were compatible with and included a
big old list so it was kind of leaked by
them yeah
in the notes actually in the reference
notes okay of all these Intel CPUs so
yeah a number of them were announced
they are expected to launch in early
2018 there's a core i3 Core i5 and core
i7 CPU listed as well as a core high
nine eight 8950 HK
8950 HK where it where is that HK let's
see that here that's two letters mmm the
end of the skew silly anyway it's that's
not a Mosel I don't know what tech spots
talking about here but yeah it's a
mobile processor so it is their first
coffee like I nine CPU but it is for
laptops um but who knows the actual core
count on that one
so yeah the list has quite a few excuse
they're pointing out here for example
the copy lake right now that we're on
which is eight to jen is 14 nanometer
plus plus they had a tick than a talk
than a talk than a talk from broad well
this guy like to Cabul a copy like the
canon leak and yeah I guess this process
was process architecture
fine I forgive us sorry anyway point is
cannon Lake is supposed to be 10
nanometre it's supposed to be the actual
dye shrink so there talk to the process
shrink we've been with so so yeah the
question right now is when they're
talking eighths gen do they mean cannon
Lake and when they're talking ninth gen
do they mean ice Lake are they gonna
call are they gonna keep calling coffee
like 8th gen and they're gonna call
cannon Lake ninth gen not really sure
also some confusion regarding the actual
dates that they talked about because
they said they will officially launch
cannon lake before the end of 2018 but
they also said that volume production is
slated for the second half of 2018 but
there's discussion about some of these
CPUs coming out at the beginning of 2018
so what's going on we're not really sure
interest I'll hopefully we'll find out
soon I'm sure there's gonna be some
stuff at CES that's that's likely but
there's no mention of based on turbo
clocks the current 8th gen core desktop
lineup so the stuffs not right now it
goes up to 4.7 gigahertz so a reasonable
expectation that it will be in that
ballpark but I noticed like we got an 86
50k here which is perhaps some sort of
in between like a 8600 k+ or maybe
without the graphics integrated it has
same timers that's what they do with the
50s sometimes a 50 skews done I've
graphics I noticed the T here so you got
some low-power ones there's a B and 8500
B what is what's with the B have you
seen Abby before I don't think so I bet
I bet there is a be out there and I just
haven't seen it 8400 B yeah I noticed if
you just look at the ones on the end
like TT thb HDTV it looks like it's like
in Calvin and Hobbes
or whatever one goes just the raspberry
so your raspberry yeah exactly
nice very nice generation list has a I 3
9000 i 390 109 390 300 I 594 hundred
ninety five hundred and eighty six
hundred and if you're thinking like
where's the seven hundreds a good
question our next story from hot
hardware talks about the i7 9700 k ninth
gen mainstream flagship cpu with eight
cores and 16 threads this was
sort of derivative from that massive
leak at i-264 thing but then there is a
Chinese language website I don't know
which one apparently apparently that
counts for all of them a Chinese
language website was able to dig up some
additional information after speaking
with motherboard manufacturers in Taiwan
in addition to the abundance of chips
already untapped Intel it's also
prepping a new flagship ninth generation
Core 9sq so the quinine 9700 K is a
mainstream SKU with 8 cores and 16
threads on the mainstream platform so it
was like I wonder where they got the
ideas like it's an industry 8 Corp 16
thread ship it took until how many years
to go from quad-core like when did they
well even from like dual core 2 quad
core and how long do they have car was
like 2007 or 2008 and I feel like that
went eight a decade in fact they went
eight years where they're like no quad
core quad core is all you can do and
then now now AMD's like hey we're back
oh man oh six core
Oh 8 quart like oh like within anyway
yeah it's basically overnight in the
grand scheme of things yeah for
competition look at that dude so I mean
it's got a question is is everyone gonna
suddenly switch over to delivering those
paper to court like in 8 corinne
everyone everyone has to no I don't
think so I don't think so I mean it's
still it's probably gonna have better
single core performance single-threaded
performance then rising well question
going back to that shirt it's still not
clear if it's gonna be 10 min 10
nanometre right and if it does shrink 10
that nanometer like there's I don't know
there's all those questions area like
heat dissipation can can be an issue
when it when it comes to the process
shrink like that and so yes difficult to
speculate too far but um that that is it
is a jump that they've been leading up
to for a while going from 14 to 10 so I
think that could potentially that plus
the kick in the pants from AMD I don't
know it could be fun to see what they're
able to do if it is 10 nanometer eight
cores because 10 nanometer would would
definitely make it a bit more power
efficient yeah she would also make the
chips run cooler and I feel like even
though right now like a six core you
know coffee like
CPU it is technically faster and a
better gaming chip than a Verizon
equivalent at the same time it's gonna
run hotter and you have to buy a better
cooler to cool it because it's not as
power efficient
yeah they clock higher but you know
that's just you know that's gonna cause
more heat issues and then you've got
you're basically locked into buying a Z
motherboard for X amount of money that's
gonna be X amount more expensive than an
equivalent be 350 board where you know
the offers cheaper boards that also
support overclocking and you know they
have lower skis that support SMT and
stuff so it's it's interesting to see
them going kind of different directions
you know what I mean it's gonna be
interesting to see what the market
prioritizes or what they really want do
they want the faster chip but are
willing to spend more for the
motherboard and overclocking ability and
and cooling or are they gonna go for a
little bit maybe less performance but
you know overall a cheaper experience
and you know better better performance
per watt I would say and then we've got
rising to on the horizon there's a lot
of unanswered questions but I don't feel
like you know pure power is is enough
anymore like just having the pure speed
is no longer enough to to sway the
consumers one way or another there's so
many other factors that AMD is hitting
so hard and they're crushing Intel over
even though Intel has the better chip or
the faster chip I should say there's
also someone doing things above us right
now it's very distracting
but and then yields is another thing
like is is Intel gonna try to rush the
ninth gen launch just like they did with
coffee lake and then all of a sudden
you're not gonna have any supply to meet
your demand and then that's gonna
increase the MS or the MSRP is gonna go
way up through the roof and no one's
gonna be able to buy them anyway or
won't be willing to pay out the ass for
a ninth gentian so true truly there are
many variables to consider and it comes
but I think all things considered I'm
happy that 2018 it looks like after like
the craziness that was in 2017
it looks like both AMD and Intel
are sort of regrouping and winding up
it's like launch more products in 2018
and like sort of ramp ups the
competitiveness like you said Zen too
we're expecting a follow-up there and
yeah but I think if Intel can take a 10
nanometer eight core 16 thread you know
little LGA 1151 CPU and make it
reasonably power efficient and have
frequencies they're in the same range
targeting was coffee like right now I
think they'll sell a lot of those
because I think I you know especially
for gaming for gaming and mixed use
systems I think that'll be a popular
option but yeah we'll see what the next
year has in store should be funk alright
so the next story I don't have any notes
on but I wanted to mention briefly
briefly it's a strange it's a strange
situation going on right now with
YouTube because on the one hand you have
the ad pocalypse thing going on or ad
pocalypse 2.0 with people getting their
videos perfectly legitimate
completely family-friendly and not
offensive videos that it get flagged for
limited ads they their flag does not
family-friendly there's a ton of tech
people who we talked to who have been
having that have happen all the time
hardware unboxed among others Al's our
studio does our studio or science to do
no science to the science to you Joker
productions I believe has had several of
those happen to him as well
so a really crappy thing especially for
anyone who's kind of trying to make a
living on the YouTube or anyone who's
anyone who's just investing a lot of
time yeah it sucks to have even when
you're getting started it sucks to have
even that little bit of feedback and a
little bit of cash back yeah for your
your efforts to suddenly just be gone
and then you have the option of like
alright do I just shut my video off you
know or just leave it and get whatever
trickle comes through there
yeah so anyway point being right now
there's all of these weird videos going
on that are aimed at children and
YouTube is apparently trying to crack
down on them
and brands have actually been pulling
been pulling their ads can fix your
confectionary maker Mondelez little Mars
and other consumer goods producers have
pulled advertising from YouTube after
Britain's Times newspaper found the
video sharing site showing clips of
scantily clad children long side ads of
major brands wait what's the name of the
site YouTube oh wait so youtubers show
okay okay yes so it's really weird but
there was another segment I've only just
barely like glanced at some stories
talking about this but they're really
creepy some of them are like like poorly
done animations but they like they're
it's kids content but like it's all just
super messed up and like some of it's
like borderline pedophile type like
garbage and it's just it's but
apparently there's some of them that
just managed to slip through the cracks
and if you can get onto the the
suggested feed for like little kids who
are just watching video after video and
can't distinguish one video here with
Peppa Pig in it from the follow up one
that's just some crazy bad thing like
that's pretty messed up so I wanted to
briefly mention it when I first put this
article in I was planning on doing a
little bit more recent research into it
but all the other stuffs I talked about
today took up a little bit more of my
time but it is also a weird contrast
just to see that there are just like
effed up channels doing this kind of
thing that somehow do have monetize
videos that are getting that kinds of
views when at the same time you have the
nonsense going on with the limited
limited add videos happening to people
who have consistent consistently been
making concept that has that is in no
way offensive to advertisers or anything
like that so right that's pretty messed
up but we'll see we'll see how YouTube
goes forward as far as dealing with this
and maybe bring you guys an update
further down the line alright last story
here for any guys who use cell phones
and hate the battery life Samsung
potentially has a fancy new upgrade a
new thing they've been working on here
using graphene and batteries to charge
five times faster so it's described as a
graphene ball and the article kind of
describes it and I wasn't really sure by
then talking about penny little graphene
balls that make it coating or whether
it's like one ball of graphene the
batteries inside I don't know so here
I'm related to graphite no I mean there
may other both made of atoms report the
report was published by Nature it says
enos it says that Samsung's advanced
Institute of Technology has been working
with graphene to both increased battery
capacity and drastically reduced
returned recharge times they used the
material to create a graphene ball a
special coating that's used inside
typical lithium ion battery so it's like
what's the ball have to do with it why
is it specifically ball shaped this is
where I'm confused this is all diffusion
hmm they're natural natural shape
yes I'm involved Samsung has got a lot
of balls doing what they're doing I
think a lot of graphene azoles that's
that's the main point here but
reportedly this increases battery
capacity by as much as 45% and increases
the speed of charging by five times Wow
yeah so you could possibly charge your
phone from zero to 100% in like less
than twenty minutes that's great and
once it's charged with last 45 percent
longer you might actually be able to go
like two days without charging your
phone or something like that that'd be
pretty cool also the batteries with this
new technology still hold a charge
retention of 78% even after 500 total
charge cycles also quite nice knowing
that your battery's life isn't going to
deteriorate over time at least not
significantly but yeah I don't know why
it's a graphene ball that's no the
articles I Darren Lee I was expecting
there to be some sort of do we do we get
a picture
of the graphing ball do we know what the
graphing Baldwin imagine like
intelligent do you know it's hopes and
little ball bearings that that like roll
like there's a phone and sitting there
and all the ball bearings roll up onto
the table and kind of creepily roll up
to the phone and then jump invade it
like somehow they just get sucked into
it on the phone and it has a phone like
at first like doesn't want it to happen
but then after it and it resists it and
then it becomes more powerful though
it's like oh and yet some but somehow it
be also it's evil after that that's and
that's where you get the Galaxy Note for
some reason that's what's blowing up in
people's faces
galaxy s 9 yeah 20 days of battery life
graphene ball per charge per every five
minute chart Hey I mean thanks balls it
improves the battery life and totally
cool and all that I'll dip my balls in
it I will - all investing what why did
my bullshit game right now you probably
I don't know you remember that no it's
probably best that the state the state
no there was a guy and that was this
capsule and that's what he would say I
want to dip money had these balls and
say well what the hell you've been
watching it suck what kind of
programming do not share your playlist
with me not interested
I bet this yeah the state Thank You
Humboldt DF humble DF remembers okay
homogeneous as asking how the truck the
trucks great I drew over here today it's
not so great driving in traffic but it's
it's do loves my trucks nice oh yeah are
we doing donations so let's answer these
questions Alice cheers first I'm
catching the show live I want to upgrade
my GTX 970 and I was wondering if I
could get a 1070 CI or a 1080 depends on
the price there Chris if you can find a
very
discounted and low-priced 1080 I would
say go for that it is but faster yeah
then again the 1070 API which cheaper
which can be had for $450 is typically a
good fifty dollars less and when
overclocked is around the same ballpark
at the 1080 so uh yeah I would go with
honestly I would go to ten seventy TI
because neither of them can really in my
opinion take on 4k with 100% confidence
you need a 1080i for that so you're
pretty much limited to 2560 by 1440 or
3440 by 1440 ultra wide in that case the
1070 the gtx 1070 that I was using for
awhile is phenomenal for those
resolutions the 1070 Ti is gonna be even
better and you're gonna be able to push
you know 100 frames per second on most
games with a 1070 TI so just save
yourself a little bit of money and
pocket the rest or put it towards
something else in your build I think
that n7 you guys be my choice if you're
really so much older and don't worry
when you're talking to your friends and
you're like like what you get in there I
got since 70 today and they're like
that's cool you're like doesn't you be
like yeah you wasted money the better
you have less money than I do now
dang thank you Chris he's got scandal
expense we you guys have good things
giving should I get pub G Battlefront 2
or Call of Duty World War 2 did you have
a good Thanksgiving I did I did good
food delicious I like two things I made
a pie and that was good - I ate a pie I
was made it was delicious
yeah Scott Pope gee I think G I mean
it's a lot of fuckin battlefront - it's
like fun don't get bail if you call of
duty yeah these are just my opinions of
those so just keep I mean
bow for us - definitely not just a
statement - EA cuz his station they
effed it all up and that's where we're
mad at them like it should be a fun
exciting Star Wars game to play and EA
was just like no we want to shit out so
yeah don't get that pub G's the least
amount of money most a lot of fun it's
very very it's very playable
yeah you can replay it I mean it better
be because way
more team based than any of those games
I don't care Call of Duty Battlefront -
yeah you're on a team but are you really
are you really you're really just a
bunch of faceless dudes running out
there on your own hoping to get the most
kills you're competing against each
other whereas in a game like pub G
you're actually talking to friends
you're you're you're competing against
other groups of fuckers and it's it's a
blast
I'll fucking find a group of like three
or four dudes get pub G it's totally
worth it
jujubee's $10 hello been a while
building my dad a slim mini rising build
while watching your show right now
total price four hundred and twenty
dollars blaze it from Black Friday
shopping woop that is a great price for
your face I'm sure you snag some pretty
hot deals on Black Friday so
congratulations for that sounds like
you're on three I'm sure your dad is
gonna be super happy yeah it's
definitely gonna be rising three I did a
$500 rise in three build for Black
Friday myself you can go ahead and check
that out
shameless plug but I hope one of our
cakes are using a slim mini raisin build
hmm there's a few options yeah
definitely a few options there but
doesn't there's any question attached to
here so I'll just say congrats congrats
Panda command a $5 say I rebuilt my
custom loop in a case with better air
flow same hardware no overclocked
running ten to fifteen degrees hotter
any clue as to why that might be
happening my guess would be if it's a
custom loop that you me probably have
something going on when it comes to the
pressure between your blocks I'm
guessing you're talking about CPU here
but maybe GPU as well maybe maybe the
pressure the block is mounted with you
might have contact there but not enough
contact to actually push down and spread
the thermal place properly so you're
getting functional but not low
temperatures beyond that I mean I assume
you know stuff like the pump not
functioning properly or something like
that might be an issue but yeah if you
have better air flow you should
definitely not be that much have that
much of a difference in temperature and
all things else considered that's the
main thing I could see that would
suddenly cause that to happen
yeah because other than that like it
would have to be like you overclocked
more cranked a bunch of voltage or
something like that yeah we we need more
information be really sure did you put
water
did you add water yeah that's nearly
Fred rained 50 bucks oh my god Alice can
more than one corsair fan RGB LED
controller and six port RGB LED hub be
used on a single computer if so is there
a max number you should know this yeah
you can definitely put six port RGB LED
hub for a single computer why not and
then one Corsair fan RGB let's see if
can use more than one you can use more
than one controller yeah you can use is
there max so it's six if you're talking
about the l series RGB fans you can
connect up to six of those fans to a
single commander Pro to my knowledge you
can have multiple commander pros
connected to one motherboard which is
exactly what I'm planning to do for the
elite build so better work so it better
fucking work and look at it the elite
build right now but there's no I don't
see a reason why it wouldn't
I don't think Corsair would limit
themselves to like this is a huge launch
this huge product for them the rakin and
serious dough from these fans like 50
bucks our fan they're not gonna limit
you to six freaking fans in one system
they understand that people have
radiators too cool bro with like
push-pull configurations so you
definitely fit in more than one
controller in there but to that work
well my guess my guess would be that
there is some sort of maximum to that
based on what the software is capable of
that kind or that kind of thing we don't
know that though yeah but Corsair would
I would I would hit them up on Twitter
perhaps or something like that see if
they can give you an answer if you're
really looking to like to do some crazy
maxed out thing or yeah you're like plug
those in and have other stuff connected
to it externally or something like that
people people like to be to do that kind
of thing you cannot wait to see what
what pops up in my part 3 video of the
we build see what happens there uh
see me ciao baby for the final
I'd give it to you every week every week
I'll give you the five powers because I
have our important thing to say ever
very very very important thing thank you
I have a grandfather's no heart eyes and
grandfather unlimited praying or he's
grandfathered into the premise with the
Verizon okay okay not so not sure if
they actually throttle me or not but I
abuse the hair out of it with my seed
box with the box of seed box uh I don't
know I mean I've seen that term before a
lot of use man
it probably means he's got something set
into the phone I don't call them stuff
off of it with this unlimited plan but
yeah I'm pretty sure they do throttle
you at a certain point some of the ISPs
have it listed they'll say like hey you
have unlimited but if you use more than
30 gigs at a month then you know we'll
start to cut you off
yes price they do that and they set it
at a point where very very specifically
only the people who are like abusing it
are gonna be affected like if you have
something connected to it that's just
constantly downloading in a fashion that
most people wouldn't typically use their
phone for around so yeah they're
probably throttling you somehow but yeah
you got to take advantage of that your
father plan till then don't let him talk
you out of that they're trying to talk
everyone out of those stay strong Pete
Jacobi Park I'm sorry Jacob uh six cents
no beer for me enjoying a goldmine
sarsaparilla instead is that root beer
it looks like it sounds like root beer
sarsaparilla
I don't know is this sarsaparilla root
beer what I don't like keep associating
root beer with sarsaparilla I think I've
heard like sarsaparilla root beer before
but that could be something completely
different
sarsaparilla we're not from whatever
part of town you drink sarsaparilla in
but can you guys check out my 1950s it's
a soft drink made from the smile X or
not a plant I smile at sometimes he'll
smile with artificial flavors not even
sure no I can be mildly alcoholic but
I'm not sure all right well enjoy your
sarsaparilla I
better that your your oh it I've had
view remaining sarsaparilla
it's the goldmine sarsaparilla okay but
it doesn't look like it's alcoholic for
him
oh no no maybe it is alcoholic it's just
not beer it's not considered beer I
don't know the helis def is in recent
times is sometimes considered to be a
type of root beer ha ha ha ha
see I wasn't crazy not really available
in most countries many pubs and most
major supermarket chains in the
Philippines Taiwan Malaysia and
Australia stock sarsaparilla flavored
soft drink I mostly remember from the
Big Lebowski
sarsaparilla yeah it's like what do you
say
no no I'm what am I talking about Big
Lebowski I'm time to back to the future
Back to the Future 3 Oh doc when doc
goes in a career really yeah i-i've
watched 1,000 times in 3 like twice
after after uh doc breaks up with his
girlfriend and he goes into the end of
the pub and the bartender is like you
know do you like whatever he usually
drinks this is you know some
non-alcoholic thing is like nah man need
something stronger than I used a
sarsaparilla
it's like whiskey in a sec are you sure
have it I don't know why I remember the
scenes wait you've got a sarsaparilla
whiskey no no the bartender was
suggesting sarsaparilla is a little
stronger
ah I see and then he and anyone's
whiskey yeah and then he sits there but
he doesn't drink it the whole Welsh Amy
shit I got the fucking didn't both his
sarsaparilla and Big Lebowski two maybe
maybe you accidentally Sioux City
sarsaparilla I was right Siouxsie Sioux
City sarsaparilla oh thank you thank you
all right get back to me yeah yeah yeah
he does drink that doesn't he right all
right okay okay sorry about the why we
really brief Segway engine uh Jacob no
that was Jacob we just talked about hop
Shepherd $10 love the show was always
playing Mass Effect but I wanted to have
a comment read for some reason my subs
are exploding since two weeks I was at
460
now at 474 damn anyway have fun and in
he'll exploit Judy's intentions on the
new sub you freeze congratulations for
your success yes yep hold on here we go
fall up up Shepard on Twitter yep
Brian Webb five dollars and 55 cents
have some money because I love your
content thank you Brian
and now you don't have any money we love
your money ah and holy and you $5 I'm
upgrading from phenom 1090 T for gaming
with a gtx 1070 at 114 40 60 Hertz is
the price difference of an 80 700 K over
a 1700 ex worth it no yes I mean you've
got you've got different applications
here I would say if you if you if you're
considering people talking you know
something if you're good sitting if
you're considering doing a lot of work
station stuff or anything that's going
to use a lot all those cores and threads
on the 1700 action of then I would say
that makes more sense if gaming is
strictly your focus then the 8700 came
might make sense you're looking at let's
say you're hitting into arisin 7 1700
that's 270 bucks
versus well over $400 so that's about a
hundred and one hundred and forty ish
dollar difference right now so not to
mention what a hundred and fifty four Z
or Z it's a pretty significant booth but
if you want the best gaming option right
now and you got to buy it next to as
these 370 board - so bear that in mind
yeah I'm just saying I'm just saying
like I don't want to I don't tell
someone who gets an 87 under K like oh
you shouldn't have done that or like
whatever like yes there are more
cost-effective out I'll tell Matt but
yeah I'll tell them the truth they don't
want to hear I will say I like the 8700
K a lot more at 370 or 380 dollars that
I've only for 15 then it makes a lot
more sense yeah Zarda
is easier an Australian Australian that
no comment Australian people thanks Mike
thank you sir price right here for your
terrible Australian accent I decided to
offend you for your worse
Zachary memory I only got one $25
haven't forgot about y'all's shiner
Woori november/december are a bit of a
time crunch in the car business and I
haven't had time to send it all to y'all
yet
no worries a curing they'll be waiting
patiently for that shiner we're well
supplied for now let's make it snappy
but yeah I'm looking forward to that
dingo on my forty not sure what that
means but I like it
five dollars no comment next time you
should donate them and then tell us what
dingo on my 40 means because it
definitely sounds like it's a phrase or
an idiom that means something specific
that I'm it's like under six or on your
bingo to my party maybe maybe it
literally means that there's a dingo an
actual dingo on his forty like he like a
40 ounce bottle of beer maybe on his 40s
mm maybe his 40 also he's not donating
not donating in Australian dollars its
US dollars so dingo my king goes here
dingoes are from australia baby's deep
two and thirty five dollar donation
risin bios zero eight zero nine posts
3,200 lpx ram update bios question mark
gift system not building till holiday
RGB 350 what it's posting so somes
detuned 30 yes if your question seems to
be should you update the boughs the
answer is yes yeah with rising systems
because there have been updates to the
microcode and the seat not just the bios
not just the UEFI that you're learning
to the motherboard but also the
microcode and the CPU itself and that
that can help things that can have
compatibility so the answer is yes
update your bios always update your BIOS
um modern motherboards they almost
always have some sort of failover or
backup for that kind of thing and that's
a lot easier to do now than it was you
know ten years ago so yeah
update your boss Richard you five
dollars Paul was it intentional that you
answered a Twitter question from Eric
shun on your probing Paul no what what
what did I do
what is damn it is it cuz it's Eric Shen
like erection erection no did you not
catch that the oldest trick in the book
Paul
you see that yes well erection that is
awesome man you know you know what's
even funnier though is the way I found
out about the one that one specifically
is that there was a kid at my high
school his name was legitimately Eric
shin well there you go
Eric shit that's that's action I'm glad
because I've grown up in Southern
California and there's lots of there's
lots of pockets of Asian communities and
that kind of thing around here so it's
very common it didn't strike me as
something that it's not like a normal
name so yeah Richard no I really that's
holy son but thank you now I realize
that I said another one to look out for
Paul is a Mike as someone mentioned in
chat Mike Mike Mike Mike hunt Mike hunt
my God knows every cunt
there's also Mike ox long my cocks long
yeah actually there was a kid in my
Spanish class in high school he was like
a total d gen he like wrote on his
Spanish test the his name was Mike GOG
swing so as that as a teacher was
passing out the test he's like all right
Kyle Kyle Hanson
I'd be like here Jenni Jenni here Mike
my cocks long my cocks long there's like
straight up from Simpsons right where
the guy answers as the bar my cocks long
and then like you just see this one kid
in class just like penny I need him I
need a man to hug a man to hug I see if
you can find me a man good all right
guys play with my girlfriend Oh
interesting name by BIOS I use msi sli
plus x99 motherboard running a 1080 in
sli in the first and fifth slot is this
correct have that motherboard but seems
not you're probably okay I mean probably
compete but if we're facing is available
depending on the actual PCI Express slot
so what you're gonna want to look at is
is the the motherboard manual for your
ms is li+ and just see what actual
how many channel how many PC Express
connections you have going to each slot
if you're a by 8 slot then you're fine
if your top slot your top slot is almost
going to be by 16 if that other slot and
the fifth slot you're connecting to is a
by 8 or by 16 then you're golden if it's
by 4 then yeah I would want to move I
would want to move that to a by a by 8
thanks for the question
bath medic craftman 5 dollars how many
RGB strips can you daisy chained to a
fan Tex p400 RGB controller it depends
on the controllers the amount of voltage
of the color the controller is providing
in my experience I've plugged up to like
6 LED strips and daisy chain them
together you might start to have the the
brightness drop off a little bit yeah
but specifically that fantex controller
I'm not positive I would say 2 to 3 and
honestly in the p400 2 to 3 should be
all you need because it's not a huge
case you can wrap fully around with with
two strips probably to 30 or 60
centimeter strips
Christopher wolf $5 I have an i7 4770k
just picked up a GTX 1080 GeForce GTX
super clock so yeah do I need an upgrade
is the new RAM or processor worth it
playing pub G a lot now you're fine
yeah very like very nice completely
something over Clarke your 4770k a
little a little bit if you if you if you
have the desire you should be able to
hit you know like before you should be
able to hit for 64.6 well it depends on
your cooler I guess yeah
you should be able to well for for is
what it just runs that I think great so
but whatever you should be able hit for
six maybe for seven or eight depending
on your CPU but yeah that's actually
very nice combo they knives for $5 to
tight mix Maxwell's for 4k 60 Hertz
keep them or sell them for 1080i or suit
entities and some extra cash also
thoughts on EVGA for the win air-cooled
versus hybrid all right to tight mix
Maxwell's for 4k 60 Hertz I would say
keep those because
those are those really nice cards um
yeah and two of them two of them right
now for 4k 60 B okay right I mean the
1080i cuz you're not gonna get to 1080 T
eyes if you're upgrading to to 1080 eyes
then I'd say that would be a decent
boost and a little bit more GPU
performance but I'd say for now you're
probably okay ed wait til the next
generation don't agree to that or
something like that unless you plan to
swap out those monitors when 4k 120
Hertz becomes available
I need more on that on Kyle's after the
show salmon goes to ten bucks hey guys I
have an FX 8320 and looking to upgrade
but I'm in college and have a really
small budget what would be the best
upgrade path for me budget of sub $400
rising 3 yeah I mean Rison is the best
platform to invest in it ten fifty if
you need a budget option with an upgrade
path yeah you can get yourself be 350
motherboard for seventy to eighty
dollars you can get yourself a rising
three quad core for a hundred bucks you
can get a six core for closer to two
hundred but yeah it's nice because you
can get that that quad that quad core
for like pretty cheap and make sure you
get a reasonably decent be 350 board if
you go that route and like we can't
promise this but everything we've been
told in our expectations right now and
what AMD has promised about am for as a
platform is they're gonna keep it until
2020 so if Zen to stuff launches this
year it's everything we've been told
indicates that it should slot into that
so it does seem to be the most viable
path for a viable platform for a future
upgrade viability as well as budget yeah
I I also did post a $400 PC builds a
couple maybe of in September back in
September you can go ahead and check
that out it might help you out yep have
you moving on J Everett with the $15
wait no sorry David cat away wait five
Australian farmers really love your
content lads I have an x 34 predator
plus a 6600 K and a gtx 980ti is my cpu
bottlenecking my GP
only in probably rare situations problem
advantage but honestly even the a 700 K
could potentially bottle like that card
it's just too fast but you have to put
it in situations that lead to a
bottleneck and with the editor X 30 for
you at 34 40 by 1440 you're not gonna
run into that situation very often so
I'd say your 6600 K is is good market if
you want David just just because you're
on that platform and you've got a pretty
nice setup as is just keep an eye out
maybe set up some deal alerts or
whatever for 6700 K and 7700 KS and if
you find one for like a really good deal
then maybe maybe invest in that but only
if it's a really good deal but yeah as
those as they say clear on inventory of
those CPUs you might be able to find
some J right 15 bucks just joining
stream love you guys Vega 56 partner
cards one nods for before Christmas two
nods for q1 2018 three nods for just
give up and buy a 1080 TIA or a 1070
yeah like yeah wait are you talking
about partner cards on your half at all
no I saw one like it was a power color
power cards got one XFX has issues has
yeah whenever they launch expensive in
their heart they're available at MSRP
it's for like a day and the price jacks
up it's not like it's crazy high like it
was like a hundred two hundred dollars
more but it's still 40 50 bucks higher
than MSRP yeah and that just leaves a
bad taste in your mouth you like what
yeah I'm giving these people 50 extra
bucks because of you know supply issues
stupid economic basic economics yes but
yeah yeah I mean right now it's still
hard to to recommend to Vega 56 in
particular if it's more than four
hundred to four hundred and twenty H
dollars yeah GTX 10 series check that
out the chill out Baghdad $7.50 Canadian
yeah 50 Canadian ha
it's not hey guys just wondering if you
could give my friend Brian a happy
shut up for this weekend happy barrel a
happy birthday rain happy birthday
Cheers cheese to your birthday I'm gonna
drink more beer now because of your
birthday mm-hmm love birthday drinking
Russell I sell $20 new GPU thoughts for
present to myself
I got an r r7 1800 X a Norris a X 370 k
7 RM 850 X G scale flare X 2400 16
gigabyte other parts of Pororo Britt is
a gtx 1080i overkill or am i ready to
rock alright wrestle um first stuff yet
I would say yes a 1080i wood would be
perfectly appropriate for your system
yeah second thing I would say man I
didn't know they made flare X kits that
were 2400 but yeah maybe consider your
faster man yeah definitely um because
these kids you three I like I like my
rise in systems to be running at 29 33
if not 3200 you did get some nice boost
in performance at that and particularly
in gaming remember remember that the
frequency of your memory affects how the
the Infinity fabric works even if any
fabric clicks at the same speed as your
memory so increasing your memory speed
is important there so pretty tasty i yes
i would consider swapping that flex kit
for a 3000 or at 3200 kit if you can
find something reasonably priced because
man the memory prices suck right now
yeah I do Sasa lipstick Peter Peter
Peter Walker Peter why five dollars new
to both channels enjoy watching your
builds two favorite youtubers now thank
yours obviously moving to mesh if I case
while watching stream keep it up guys
beautiful yeah mesh if I see is awesome
yeah it's a nice portable case I mean
very happy tons of tons of mesh
obviously at the front very good airflow
send us d kqk 50/50 deep Dixie Dixie
with the DK 56 it's the most valuable
currency dicks worth upgrading to an
8700 Danish Krone Danish Kroners same
thing eighty-seven worth is it worth
upgrading to an 80 700 K from a 3770k
I did take the chance on an asus strix z
370 F motherboard quite cheaply on Black
Friday already was like 35 percent of
and then
comment gets cut off but I yes pretty
good that's a pretty good bump I say yes
because very gentle course bumped from
Ivybridge it's you've already got your z
370 board so that's not a question like
sometimes it's like what anything so
when someone's like should I invest in
coffee like you always have to say all
right well you're gonna get an Uzi 370
board and there's a reasonable set of
them available but um yeah you've
already got the board so I'd say yeah do
it 700 hundred can you do it
you can probably sell that 3770k for a
pretty penny too does it not in
production anymore
sometimes they go get some cash back for
that yeah all right are Clardy within a
ten dollar donation rise and I'm gonna
read this one do it fire it off thousand
five fifteen hundreds as Rock x-37b I
wonder which one 16 gigs of g.skill to
buy eight thirty two hundred speed and
the GTX 1070 TI decent build for
workstation running multiple VMs as well
as like gaming ESO hmm yeah I mean yeah
that's pretty nice
I don't think I mean next to me 70 Ford
yeah I would say your ex 370 might have
been a little overkill but but I will
say they actually so many boards if
you're gonna overclock tend to be better
at that they tend to have a little bit
higher and power delivery configurations
on them and your 1500 X if you're
running multiple VRMs err I'm sorry volt
multiple VMs I would definitely keep the
upgrade to like a 1700 in mind cuz that
would be a very nice boost there yeah
all in all though I think you have a
very nice configuration 3200 speed
memory ya think you're looking good and
yeah keep the keep an eye on our seven
seventeen hundreds that'd be a nice
upgrade for you need or hold out for Zen
to total rage $5 donation this is the
last one hey guys having an issue where
when I update my graphics drivers my
screen starts to flicker and eventually
blue screens with the duty X 1080
could be is it a beta is it a beta
wickel driver or something like that
yeah that's icing I would probably roll
back to an older driver the driver that
you had before to see if that problem
persists and if it does not then I would
just wait until
a future driver comes out sometimes
almost that that also kind of seems like
maybe a power issue so I would double
check your power supply if you've got
something that's a little bit on the
lower end or maybe it doesn't have quite
the the juice needed or if it's a budget
power supply or maybe just even
something as simple as as if the
connectors are seated all the way I
think that could be something that is
causing issues get a stop donating oh my
gosh
stop asking things we need to end this
half so we can go to cows half there
will be more chance to donate to his
this actually let's let's end this let's
