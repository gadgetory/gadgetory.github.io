Dinkin is all power all about you know
dear God
at least at least we're letting people
know what they're in for from the get-go
yeah alright hello everyone and welcome
to awesome hardware this is a live show
we talk about technology and we stream
live every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time to our YouTube channels and
we stream to twitch so twitch TV /
awesome hardware if you won't wanna
watch the whole show it's and its
entirety from from beginning to end with
all of the outtakes and everything like
that or if you just want to watch the
respectable parts we streamed the first
half of today's show which is episode
144 to cow's channel bit wit and that's
like in the video's description you can
click on that if you didn't watch it and
that will at least explain to you how we
got to where we are where we are is
we've had a few beers and we've
discussed like the NVIDIA GeForce
Partner Program and a few other things
like that those long Kyle's half of the
show I was a pain that much attention
we're gonna talk about my average I'm
just kidding just game it's very very
close scary bruise very important
everything with Kyle said I'm I have the
show we're gonna talk about the new HTC
vive pro and other things too
but a quick word of warning occasionally
we do use adult language on the show so
if you've got yemen's or folks who might
be particular about hearing bad language
from time to time dan their ears run
children run yeah before we get you Cal
said and in the meantime if you're of
age and are drinking responsibly than of
course feel free to join us and having a
drink
as we continue awesome hardware's 100 at
forty four in this strike flow and I've
noticed you mmm that's you and Chet I
see you okay before we get into the show
proper if you want to help support us
check out our stores my store is pulsar
Burnett and you can order lots of
high-quality gear and merchandise it's
got my logo on it or it's got awesome
hardware logos on it awesome hardware
stuff if you buy
profits are split between me and Cal
other than that I get all the money the
beer set for example is very popular you
get a bottle opener as well as a super
nice Imperial pint glass which is much
more fluid than your typical domestic
pint glass super awesome
you can also buy stuff from cattle store
bibtex lash store yes it all comes from
the same place and we made sure that all
this stuff is real real nice
yep know that quality desk mats have
been selling very well oh yeah
as well as the the all awesome hardware
I got one of the sample shirts for the
the Star Wars kind of base design it
looks really really nice it's solid it's
super nuts that's a design by by Brian
okay mark so to Drew's participated he
actually sent us some other stuff
otherwise but he also participated in
our in our design submission thing from
last year yes so thanks to you guys if
you guys happen to buy anything from you
of our stores will yell Johnson at you
at the end of the show indeed we will
all right let's continue my half of the
show with further news and as I've
already teased the HTC vive pro in turn
is finally available for pre-order sweet
in fact you can pre-order it right now
for the low low price of $500 which
seems like pretty reasonable deal and
until you realize that that price is
only for the headset I'm sorry
$800 $800 dollars is for the headset
which is how much it was the original
vive was for everything for everything
now at the same time they have reduced
the price of the current vive system to
$500 hmm but the new headsets means the
old headsets stuff in order to function
so the new headset works with existing
valet houses and controllers but that
does mean that since there is no
standalone version
of the vive pro headset with vive light
boxes and everything that you do need to
buy both of them right now if you're
starting from scratch if you've already
got the vibe so this is more of an
upgrade yes if you've already got the
vibe you can you can upgrade to the
viper lense at 300 bucks you're fine
right if you don't have any of the vive
stuff then you gotta buy both pretty
much in order to get it working
I don't think which is $1,300 which used
to seem like a lot of money before GPU
prices were what they are now now it's
it's totally reasonable right
interesting so only there's only been
iterations done to the headset itself
the controllers are still the same
controllers it's all the same there are
no 2.0 version light boxes are still the
same okay so let's move up that's the
new stuff with the headset and this this
is we've we've talked about this a
little bit before but sure so the to 200
LED displays in one for each eye are
higher resolution 1400 by 1600 as
compared to 1080 by 1200 on the current
five so that's um that's a decent boost
in resolution and especially when you
consider how close those LED displays
are to your eye and actually sort of it
you get a little bit more bang for the
buck when it comes to the enhanced
resolution and additional pixels in that
case means you'll also need a stronger
PC too right that's true there are organ
AMA changes with the headset as well it
has built-in headphones now which is one
of the things that was pretty popular
with the oculus rift right the the vive
had a headset jack on it right which
allowed you to use your own headset
which could have been nice depending on
your situation and if you have a really
nice that's it just plug in yeah but
with cumbersome with the rift and maybe
this was more of a like our in at least
my interaction with the rift and a lot
of situations was in a like a show floor
environment where you had lots of people
jumping in and out to try out a demo or
something like that right in that case
the rift made a lot of sense because you
just pop it on and you've got the
headphones that are right there
right whereas with the vibe it's just a
little bit more comfortable cumbersome
unit to also add the headset on as well
that was
nobody thinks includes the headphones as
part of it which seems to be a desired
upgrade yeah also the head strap
tightens with a dial now instead of
velcro and that's actually pretty cool
because the velcro straps on the
original vibe we're pretty crappy and
cumbersome I mean they were necessary in
order to allow it to fit a wide variety
of different sizes of domes
but getting getting it strapped in
properly was definitely not the easiest
thing right and also the potential for
like you know getting your hair cut the
velcro that kind of um the vibe is still
being aimed at high-end VR as still
being geared as as a high-end VR
solution so prices are still on the
higher end
you still need a high end gaming PC in
order to pair it with there at least
with the lot the announcements they've
made just recently it doesn't seem like
they are going the same route as like
oculus cos oculus right now has $199
$200 oculus go mobile headset that
they're launched launching in May HTC
still seems content to pinpoint that
higher end market people who have a
gaming PC that's capable of pushing the
games at the higher resolutions the
tethered experience with the headset
which is cumbersome because it's
tethered but the flipside is high
resolution you don't have to worry about
battery life and that kind of thing so
it's definitely still has its niche as
far as people who are using it and who
are interested in the games being
developed on it right also the vibe
apparently with HTC they typically they
often target business uses and I don't
know there's probably a wide array of
different implementations there mm-hmm
the article doesn't go into that much
detail so I don't have any examples for
you but um they seem to be doing enough
business to get by so there you go yeah
that's pretty much it
the only other thing in the articles
that I wanted to point out is actually
again related to oculus the competitor
which is that they are also developing a
fully tracked standalone device
codenamed Santa Cruz so possible that
oculus is sort of diverging its product
stack into the aforementioned oculus go
mobile which is less expensive 200 bucks
right more mainstream but probably
doesn't have that much capability when
it comes to actual graphics processing
horsepower and but but possibly oculus
is also working on again attract
solution which is one of the things with
the HTC vive that made it a very
superior experience and a lot of the
reviewers from the standpoint of a lot
of your viewers who just found that the
range of motion you get with the light
boxes and everything was what's pretty
cool yeah and I tend to agree with so
cool there's new stuff happening this
year with the in the VR space let's move
up
that's no obvious a like it's it's it's
kind of cool to see the are making
headway but it also just goes to show
that it's still far away far away off
from becoming mainstream I feel like
well that was always the the big dilemma
barrier to entry with the original VR
launches was the VR hardware itself as
far as the headsets and everything was
expensive and you needed at minimum
probably a $1000 gaming PC right if but
but more ideally at 1200 plus dollar
gaming PC in order to actually push it
right so it's a pretty significant
investment yeah it's not like it like
there's a lot fewer like families pardon
me there's a lot fewer families who can
say yes I'm gonna drop two thousand
dollars on this gaming configuration for
your Christmas present or whatever right
versus the set is moving here is
rearranging his bed and
bumping the lights and stuff like that
versus the experience that you get with
like a game console where it's like oh
here is a single one time you know 300
400 dollar investments that gets you the
whole set effort yeah so there we go I'm
sure there's more to come to that in the
future he has at least reclaimed the
large bed yes that's good we're making
progress that's - but I have to dog beds
is a smaller bed and there's a larger
bedding the small bed theoretically the
smaller bed should be for nori cuz she's
a Corgi and she's smaller and she's tiny
but of course she's a Corgi and she's
like I'm just gonna take the big bed and
she just pumps plops down and corgis
assholes yeah yeah Hiro has reclaimed
the big bed so he seems good job Hiro
he seems content to a bed that fits you
okay
slightly less that there's there's a
macabre element to this story which is
uber has had its first fatal accidents
and in fact the first fatal accident
caused by a self-driving car at least in
the United States as far as I'm aware no
this was in Tempe Arizona no there was a
death of the Tesla yeah but that was a
test that was the operator of the Tesla
operating the Tesla in a way that it
wasn't intended to be out yeah he was
being whereas this was an uber
self-driving car but just working as
intended that ran into someone and
killed them in Tempe Arizona Sunday
evening a woman was fatally struck after
walking in front of an uber car
traveling in self-driving mode well know
it's important to point out though as a
lot of these tests are going on that
they are monitored by a person and yes
there was a person behind the wheel
behind the wheel uh-huh that the article
like III said there was a person behind
the wheel I'm not sure if that was in
the driver's seat or in the front seat
the article said front seat I feel like
if you're in the front seat you might as
well be in the driver's seat right in a
position to take over if necessary yeah
but obviously the situation was such
that the person who was in control
wasn't able to
to take over for the AI and time to
prevent their probably texting or
watching a YouTube video I mean well I
would hope I would hope that if you're
hired by uber to be a ride-along in a
self-driving car that you're taking your
job seriously and paying attention to
the road and taking notes and that kind
of thing uber cuz that's your job you're
new it's no no it's not the same as an
uber driver as an uber driver who you
are me thank you so maybe that was you
but maybe that was the company's thing
it was like let's just hire some Rando
off the street who would be our average
super average uber driver let's just
pick a person the average uber driver
and see what would happen if the average
uber driver was Manning one of these
vehicles because I mean how many times
you've gotten to the uber gotten into an
uber and been like yeah this could have
been a really way better drink dude yes
I have had sketchy uber dry maybe that
was part of the experiment and it
unfortunately ended up in someone dying
like I don't know I would feel like in
these Ardi situations where uber is
trying to develop their technologies so
they can have self-driving cars and I
have to pay for those pesky drivers so
they have to pay to drive cars so I
would hope someone who's at least at a
slightly higher level than just a random
who got approved to be an uber driver
but then but but then then that it's
like okay then why then why weren't they
able to steer the car away from hitting
this person and that's a good question
and a few people have already posted in
chat and as because this has been
covered by multiple different news
outlets as far as the actual situation
the actual specifics of what happened
and whether it was a how dark it was and
if the person and themselves was you
know walking out into the street when
they shouldn't have or anything like
that
I don't know those details yet they're
not included in this article I don't
know if they're going to be released
there's the local police who is
investigating this and there's still
information that we don't know yet so
right that's what's to be said there the
reason we bring this up here on the show
where we
about technology is of course that
self-driving cars are pretty it seems
like importance and unavoidable
technology it's gonna happen that's the
point and probably what's gonna happen
what self-driving technology becomes
prevalence is it's gonna have a net
positive results yeah on the amount of
accidents and fatalities and injuries
that occur so basically what you're
saying is that we got to break a few
eggs to make an omelet in the in in the
form of a couple this is from MIT
technology review so you guys can go to
everyday people sucks but it's and and
and you're right it's it's one of those
situations where you like you knew as
soon as they started putting artificial
intelligence controlled vehicles on the
road at some points based on the chaotic
nature of our universe and the inability
to predict everything and all outcomes
something that's going to happen at some
point right now the article seems to be
indicating that the reaction to this
because this happened in the pit in the
past 24 to 48 hours and it doesn't seem
like there's a huge backlash all of a
sudden with people saying like these
cars should be taken off the road and
self-driving technology isn't the way
and robots are can I kill us all or
something like that that doesn't seem to
be the reaction so all that is to say
this happened maybe there will be more
information coming out about it at some
point in the future but hopefully as
this technology progresses we will not
see any backlash to it that's
significant enough to prevent the
progression of technology that's in the
long run can it help us have an easier
way to get from point A to point B right
a cheaper way most likely as well
yeah probably more fuel efficient and
almost definitely safer yeah so
competitively we will can bear this
incident to how many people were killed
by cars drive in the past 24 hours and
it's probably a pretty
start difference there of course you
know there's other variables how many
self-driving cars on the road and
whatnot yes this is something to keep
track of because you're probably gonna
have people who have the reaction to
this that is more negative and yeah I
mean that's not an easy question that's
not a that's not an easy answer to
someone who's developing artificial
intelligence algorithms for self-driving
vehicle right yeah you're technically
responsive because the cars driving
along and there's there's like a there's
like a baby you know that gonna baby
carriage and an elderly woman or the you
know there's like an old person and a
baby and it's like the cars got to
decide who it's gonna hit it's like
you're driving at 60 miles per hour you
have this much time to react I would
hope the ly chooses the old person what
is the artificial intelligence decide I
hit them both because it's equal deal
person the old person because they're
old and they've already lived their will
their life but how does it I mean I mean
that is that is a serious deep ethical
question that we should not be
discussing at this point an awesome
hardware because we've been drinking
you're right so let's move on let's not
tell all answers should come to a little
point two drunk dudes deciding
everything okay we're gonna separate
please good car not corn car nut corner
car nuts this is a French company which
is why they don't have a you after the
cue because their friend should they
don't care we this French company car
NASA has created this product called the
qc1 it's a cryptocurrency mining
computer which is also a space heater I
do that you thought crypto was all about
you know just wasting energy and stuff
like that but now you can buy this unit
which is not only pleasing you know look
at that it's a it's a heater wallet
mine's Korea so okay this is an
extension of their q-rad computing here
that was released in 2013 this unit can
mine crypto
seize and utilize the generated heat for
heating your home so you might have a
heater right now that like uses gas or
electricity to generate heat that's
costing you mind then you know making
made for that energy you can generate
the heat and also be mining crypto at
the same time it makes perfect sense
what GPUs are ok yes it has a passive
cooling solution on the outside as you
can see by the kind of radiator designed
that you're seeing right there this very
simplistic diagram which I that does not
look like a power supply at all I don't
think that counts then this picture of a
finger when all these lights on it I'm
not exactly sure what that does it's the
future its LEDs lighting its future yes
to it and this picture is probably the
picture you want to look at it's got a
passive cooling solution so basically
the big old radiator on the outside my
question it's a noiseless design it does
not require any fans and it has no
mechanical hard drives inside
but what happens if you're really cold
or no if you're really hot already but
you also want to make extra money you
have to stop mining but you really need
the money or leave your house you could
really use the money but you're already
it's already like 90 degrees in your
house it seems like it's the only way to
make it less money is to turn the heater
on it's gonna be less two less effective
it might really be in the summer I guess
apparently is what it comes so this is
really gonna thrive them like you know a
nerd yeah yeah it makes more sense in
colder climates countries that have
called the climates yes exactly Kyle
okay all right that's trim get behind
that the system actually includes a pair
or two rx 580 graphics cards there's
sapphire nature plus GPUs the entire
unit has a hash rate of around 16 mega
hash per second which is you know decent
and it's got a couple different modes
that can operate in the normal mode is
creates 450 watts of heat and you can
also turn on a booster mode that jacks
set up by 200 watts for a total of 650
watts
heat outputs it's capable of heating a
20 square meter room
it is plug and play it says it takes
only ten minutes to set up you plug it
in you load up the app on your smart
phone and you plug in your crypto wallet
and then it starts mining it mines
Bitcoin litecoin and aetherium and it
costs only twenty nine hundred euros
that's right
just twenty nine hundred years that's
like over three thousand us around three
thousand five hundred and seventy five
US dollars shit plus three hundred
dollars for shipping bringing your total
to just shy at four thousand dollars why
not just build a fifteen hundred dollar
mining rig and running 24/7 and then
you'd have a here but look how elegant
look at slick the elegance here I mean
come on you're gonna pay triple the
price look at this design is elegance
worth triple price look at that finger
just fingering doesn't come with the
finger it's got this wood finish we get
that finger and look at the look at the
map it's the kind of phone apps like hey
on January 12th you were making this
much money look at how rich you are not
January 30th you made this much money
and today you made this bunch of money
shit crashed in here's your here's all
your money and cry and regret this trip
time I know man if you order before
March 20th they will deliver it before
June 20th so so I guess if you're a lot
of money speculating on investing in
hardware for mining crypto you get like
a good month plus of uncertainty while
they're considering shipping this to you
where the price of Bitcoin or other key
crypto currencies may fluctuate in ways
you could not possibly have imagined
report with great o stuff to look
forward to that's okay we let's move up
alright pop G we're a beer player
unknowns belgrad's there's two right
there I've done player unknowns Bella
grants has
released a mobile version yes you can
play Clarins unknowns battleground on
your mobile Oh God now if you're looking
at this intro here and you're like what
are these strange characters that is
cheney's this is actually being launched
by 10 cents so this is a Chinese mobile
version of pub G it is called
exhilarating battlefield exhilarating oh
my god Chinese the most Chinese they
could ever do
exhilarating incinerating battlefield
exhilarating so much I need that on a
shirt we try to find bad English shirts
and they're usually pretty common
finding one that's actually like printed
decently and everything is very
challenging I found one that I would
have worn all the time but when I washed
it it shrank like half the size it was
just it was super tight on this they
never could anyway point being
exhilarating battlefield is super
exciting everyone should play it this is
a mobile version of pub G which exists
specifically because 10 cent which is a
big company in China they operate WeChat
among other things they bought up the
rights to publish pub G from mobile
phones late last year sorry about the
dogs barking right now everybody ignore
the dogs dogs gonna count doggy emojis
in chat close the door real quick oh
yeah all the way yeah there we go okay
perfect much better so 10 cent actually
bought the rights to publish pub G on
mobile phones late last year and this is
the mobile version that they have
launched it should be available outside
of China at some point in the future but
as of today it's only available for
droid in Canada as a test lunch okay and
imagine if you're in general if you're
in China then then maybe you have access
to it as well it is apparently mostly
the same as the xbox Xbox version of pop
G in terms of contents just the original
single map is available but it does have
some of the updates that that pop G has
come up with over the past few months
such as the ability to vault what it's
creepy what is green what that's a
Chinese thing no yeah no that's that's a
Chinese thing yes that's a Chinese thing
that's not because Chinese people's
blood is green but because showing blood
in China there's the censorship against
it you can't show blood similar things
just like like I was reading up a little
bit but about to select the World of
Warcraft version that went in into China
and like some of the undead characters
and showing like bones and stuff like
that Wow there are certain restrictions
on what you can show that's so
interesting well you can and can't show
in China they have established once it
it's blue and cream mode so yeah so the
plight is green it's still blood it's
just green it's not red but so there's
the mini-map for example will show icons
that indicate the auditory clues around
you such as footsteps and gunfire and
that's to help improve the experience
for people who are on mobile who might
not have headphones plugged in or might
not be able to turn the volume up and
there are BOTS so that's their mouse
that's a possibility as well his spots
being included but it's interesting this
is interesting because China was
originally considering banning the game
for being anti-communist or didn't align
with their political values to some
degree I remember China making a big
stink about this game in particular I
don't make any assumptions about what
the Chinese government is doing but I
will say that when something has a
certain level of popularity
and when there's something that's
exciting enough to people even outside
of the area where it's gained popularity
you know if you have people in China who
want to play pop G then there's probably
enough push that people are interested
in it they're gonna try to introduce it
there in some way shape or form and
Tencent is huge in China I mean they're
one of the biggest companies in China
so then purchasing it obviously they're
gonna have the clout to launch it in
such a way that is playable and gets
around the censors and yeah whatever
I'll say baby green blood yep exactly
all right next up we've talked about net
neutrality here on the live show from
time to time because we consider it to
be a pretty important thing that people
should be somewhat concerned about if
you use the internet and Ear want to
have the ability to access the Internet
at a reasonable price if you want to
access the internet and be able to
connect and access anything on the
internet without having anything blocked
net neutrality should be important to
you net neutrality was basically shot
down late last year in 2017 by the
current FCC and since then there have
been a slew of lawsuits that have been
brought against the FCC seeking to
overturn the net neutrality decision
that was made those lawsuits were
brought by more than three dozen
entities including Democratic attorneys
general from 22 different states
consumer advocacy groups and tech
companies such as Mozilla Vimeo and Etsy
now since all of these lawsuits have
been brats basically they have done a
consolidation twelve different lawsuits
against the FCC seeking to overturn the
net neutrality repeal have been
consolidated into one case at the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in the
United States now on one side of this we
have the internet service providers and
the internet service providers are
represented by the NCTA
CTIA and US telecom NCTA is the internet
and television Association CTIA is the
wireless Association and US telecom is
the broadband Association if you guys
want to check out the ARS technica
article that's linked in the video's
description
all of the articles by the way I'm
talking about today are linked in this
video's description
you can read up a little bit more about
this in particular about what each which
companies each of these represents so
for example the NCT a represents Comcast
charter Cox and Altis CTIA represents
AT&amp;amp;T Verizon Wireless t-mobile and
Sprint u.s. telecom represent 18 theand
Verizon Wireless telcos with copper and
fiber networks and all three groups also
represent a range of smaller Internet
service providers so we are going to
want to keep an eye on us because this
is the backlash to the decision by the
FCC to roll back net neutrality
protections for the Internet in the
United States and we're hoping that
through this you know through the
lawsuits they're brought forth or
whatever that there might be some
protection that's put into place for net
neutrality and the u.s. personally
there's I think there's two ways that it
could go either the Internet is made
more of a public utility in which case
like I might still have just a single
point of contact or access for my
network connection but it's regulated in
such a way that it is a reasonable
connection speed and a reasonable price
or yeah we go the free market rather and
we let the free market decide how the
connections should work in which case I
should have a choice so if I have three
different internet service providers to
choose from then there's some
competition going on there right and
ideally I should be able to choose from
one that provides me a reasonable
combination of price for the service I
get as well as connection speed
and those ISPs would have to compete
with each other yes to create the best
possible service for the consumer yeah I
hope you just I'm okay with I'm okay
with either of those yeah what I don't
want is what the ISPs want right now
which is the ISPs get to do whatever
they want
and operate in such a way that they're
treated as a free open market but yeah
due to the restrictions of the ability
to deliver Internet service connection
and connectivity and rollout say for
example fiber connections I only have
one choice of Internet service provider
to access right we need some solution to
this that's in between and FCC and the
United States at least has not been
making decisions that are favorable to
the consumer so we're gonna keep on top
of this and hopefully because there's
enough there's as many entities and
individuals that are pushing for this
then hopefully will eventually come to a
positive results for the majority of US
consumers don't this could take about a
year to this side according to the
article that's if it lasts as long as
the previous case that upheld the net
neutrality rules in 2016 so in 2015 was
when Internet service providers were
classified as title to common carriers
and of course the Internet service
providers put up a big stink about that
and tried to challenge it and quote and
everything like that in 2016 it was
upheld so now the FCC after all they
went through that the FCC in 2017 was
like action all that stuff we've decided
was probably crappy and let's just roll
it back and change net neutrality now
we're hoping that the courts will uphold
the same decision they made in 2016 and
overturn what the FCC is trying to do
bouncing back and forth yeah okay enough
with the politics or slightly
politically good stuff
Kyle's half of the show we talked about
the GPP the GeForce Partner Program and
we showed a few screenshots that have
been taken from different retailers and
whatnot on the Internet's
and how they may be potentially are
changing the way that they market
advertise and label their graphics cards
such to the extents that's perhaps
geforce the nvidia geforce series of
graphics cards might be the ones that
maintain association with the gaming sub
brands that many major graphics cards
adam board manufacturers have created
such as asus rog republic of gamers hmm
gigabyte horas which they use for their
gaming oriented products MSI gaming what
is it as MSI call this baby games gaming
stuff missing gaining so very creative
game moves them if we continue with the
assumption that was made on Kyle's half
of the show that the company's the third
party added board adding card
manufacturers are going along with this
then obviously we need to help out with
a rebranding effort going along with the
different companies who have been forced
to abandon associating AMD Radeon
graphics cards with some of their sub
brands in particular here we're going to
talk about asus rog simply because
they're probably one of the more
well-known ones so the sword fight
question we're gonna argue about right
did I even introduced this a sword fight
I didn't wait third fight it's time for
survey right here I think most people
infer that a day I'm just bringing back
up your screen because somehow I I don't
know it just got silly yeah paste the
link into chat I can post this into
twitch chat there we go I'm doing it
into YouTube that's on twitch at under
that won't work though oh you're right
according to according to sell oh yeah
Jesus it didn't used to be like this
like a month ago it's also like maybe I
might need to assign you as a modern
moderator on my channel that should be
us but do not have maybe
just logged into the any pipe being
we're gonna help a Seuss decide if the
Asus Republic of gamers the ROG brand
can only be used for nvidia gpus now
what should their AMD brand be called
and i haven't you quite a few solutions
here okay before the new asus which you
can be associated brand going along with
their theme are for public of gamers we
have the commonwealth of competitors the
COC we have the federation of fanatics i
have the anarcho-syndicalist commune of
aspirants yes that's pretty good the
district of disputants i know does that
work for you the DoD or the special
special economic zone of rivals and
these all of course have associated
shorthand to go along with them because
of course IRG it becomes become so so
synonymous so what do you what do you
think here obviously we're gonna we're
gonna feed this over to Welsh a sous and
obviously they're gonna implement this
choose one of these options there's no
other choice but to go along with this
but how's the oven and or any of these
but I'm trying to find you stream
because I want to bring up chat it's
like you like pace shit why isn't it why
don't you just go to the the show dock
where it's because I thought this would
be quicker and it's not cuz I don't know
tight there you go there's a bitch there
this but then like I don't like your
chat window just became white it just
turned white the whole chat window just
went like like Frost is he gonna do
gaming to youtube.com what so regular
YouTube just is broken is that no it's
just white I don't mean white like I
mean it was great at like everything was
great at like it almost like it was like
a crash like the window crap I know I'm
weird I don't know I don't know why
that's like that okay let me let me just
answer the fucking question here federal
federal financial competitors
syndicalist I don't even pronounce that
since it's a Monty Python reference the
Calais commune of esperance I've told
you we're in Marquis anarcho-syndicalist
commune we take it in turns to act as a
sort of executive officer for the week I
think special economic zone of rival
speak'st medieval decision of that
operative officer has to be ratified as
a special bi-weekly meeting in the case
just purely internal affairs
okay we're nervous of your jibber-jabber
and you know your specifications here I
think that special economic zone of
rivals I just like the acronym that's
our alliance I think that just does
that's also my chain it my chain is
shadow right because chain is all about
the special economic zones I thought
that of course right yes so that would
make sense sure make perfect sense
all right I so you're choosing and
you're chosen
choosing special economic zone of rivals
that's all I'm gonna go with the combo
of competitors I just feel I like the
alliteration there ok cock cock is a
good cock in the haste there all right
shoot about here but everyone is looking
results all right wait what happened
should you delete oh you deleted the
entire link and everything what it's
fine don't worry about control seeing
everything now what it's good let's see
what there was a little sorry let's see
people I was second though I mean talk a
Sue's cock I mean I couldn't beat
Commonwealth and competitors it's
obviously did I never be sure therefore
this zone right there it is hey if any
of the the asus marketing people are
watching kaká news you are welcome you
are very welcome
all right cock it up let's talk about
something else okay let's talk about
something all right we're not gonna
we're not gonna we're not gonna dive
into this rabbit hole all right we're
just gonna show you that the rabbit hole
exists
because honestly I haven't looked at the
newsfeed in the last 3-4 hours and I
don't even know what's going on right
now so all that is to say that there is
some news in the past 24 48 hours that
is tech related okay but that is also a
sort of a quagmire of potential
political discussion that we usually
don't dive into here on the live show
simply because I want to recognize a lot
of people might be watching this show
specifically to avoid about topics that
might be associated with the current
political situation but anyway all that
it's to say there's a lot of stuff going
on with Facebook right now and the verge
specifically posted an article today
about how to delete facebook for people
who may or may not be not so happy with
recent news about Facebook about how
Facebook gathers data on the people who
use Facebook and specifically how
Facebook maybe makes that data available
to third parties and how third parties
might take that data and possibly use it
for shady purposes yeah you know you
want to say like to sell stuff to people
like marketing purposes but even beyond
may be used for stuff even even shittier
than that so again don't want to dive
into that necessarily but I did want to
ask people in the audience watching
today is it time to delete facebook as
the article on the verge and it's always
been a time to delete facebook
specifically there is no reason there is
very little reason to have a Facebook
account these days because you can
download your information because the
leaders go to Reddit because what
Facebook has become over the last five
six years is just a watered-down version
of Reddit where no one actually is
posting about their own lives anymore on
Facebook
you can't just log onto Facebook and
know what your distant friends are up to
no it's just all recycled material and
and shares of random articles that you
probably don't care about that are just
being plastered onto your feed and so
you know like I thought that was cool
about Facebook back in the day where
it's like oh what's like so-and-so feel
like you know we're not like super close
best buds or whatever but thanks to
social media I can still kind of know
what he's up to and like maybe connect
with them sometime
and like there's none of that anymore
it's just you know news articles and
viral media it's really just viral media
with you know videos that are just like
little packaged little packaged things
that are sent out and get millions of
views and have you know monetary
benefits for the affinity uploader and
stuff but Facebook isn't what it was
it's not a social media network as much
as it was back in the day so apart from
whatever political things are going on I
don't like before all this shit happened
I felt like Facebook was kind of useless
to begin with so I'm gonna I'm gonna go
with no we don't need Facebook in any
regard
yes that's reasonable and so like this
news recently sort of has tied in with
the line of thinking that I've gone
along with with a lot of stuff and this
is like this is you know I feel like
it's important to separate the general
from the specific great and I think
there are general there are general
ideas you can have about something and
then there's specifics that you can deal
with on a case-by-case basis so to speak
generally speaking when something
becomes really good and really popular
it eventually gets to a point let's take
for example like an individual business
or something like like there's there's
lots of websites social media platforms
that have become very popular at a
certain point whoever's in charge of
that whoever is kind of the
the brainchild behind the popularity
behind whatever you know substance
beneath the platform that causes people
to feel like it's a compelling
experience to engage with at some point
that person steps back steps aside they
sell the company that company becomes a
commodity and then suddenly it dives
into this area of like oh now we have a
board of directors and we have a stock
you know it's it's a public company now
and we have stock that's bought and sold
and we have stockholders and our
obligation is the people who own the
stock to make the stock value go up and
up and up and at that point it just
invariably invariably becomes shitty
like it goes downhill things become
crappy now Facebook is actually slightly
more of a unique situation because
Zuckerberg has actually maintained such
a level of control over it so maybe this
isn't even actually the best example of
what I'm talking about right now but I'm
kind of tired of things getting popular
to the point where everyone uses them
and then becoming shitty like great you
know there's a bunch of people that use
this yeah and now we've we've sold it
like the people in charge of it have
sold it and now it's owned by the
corporation and now it's just about
making as much money out of that thing
as you possibly can and then just become
shitty and in a situation that's true
and in a situation where something's
ubiquitous or you or entrenched then you
have a situation where the people in
charge of that start taking advantage of
the people who are using the platform
and again this is very general the way
I'm talking about this but it's
frustrating because any time it's it's
it sucks that anytime you get really
excited about something or enthusiastic
about something like Star Wars
let's take Star Wars as an example
Disney has bought Star Wars and they're
milking the crap out of it oh so much
merchandise and everything and and you
want to look at the movies and be like
well as long as they're staying true to
the you know the the fundamental values
of the movies or you know as long as
they have some larger message that
they're displaying or something like
that then that makes it all okay and you
know I don't know like I guess it
depends a few whether or not you like or
you like the last Jedi all this is to
say I hate when things become
corporatized
and suddenly it goes from being
something cool that everyone was into
and enjoyed it through just being cool
how much money can we milk out of the
people who are using this platform right
and in my opinion that's kind of our
Facebook has come at this point it has
gotten to at this point I mean they have
to have been there and even beyond wild
even beyond milking money out of people
how big they are
it's like manipulating people by
manipulating their opinions and stuff
beyond that yeah anyway I don't want to
go too much beyond that because again
that's really true there is a very yeah
I don't go beyond that but here we go
let's at least see what people think
about this particular thing we have it's
really close that's very close pretty
close not a lot of boats but we still
have 40% saying yes time to deletes
we have no 36% but we do have 24% same
they already deleted I did try to make
that as somewhat viable yeah third
option right so we'll just these but
there does seem to be a more than half
the people I would presume from this
result at least for my viewers who are
right can't over Facebook at this point
and I don't blame you one bit yeah all
right really quickly I was gonna do a
last segment which was just how much the
video cards cost right now oh geez
we did this we've done this before this
is just the the Newegg website I am
literally just going directly to
components video cards and video devices
desktop graphics cards now we're gonna
see how much they cost right now what do
we want look what are the bait what's
Vegas what our Vegas costing Ben Vegas
800 dollars shipped from and sold by
Newegg Oh
radio radio but you got 56 that's like a
GTX 1074 $800 yeah wow that's that's
more than double the price of what it
should be
so alright these are these are in stock
that's just depressing why would you end
on this note turn this is no just leave
the show leave shitty inside Tran
reality check is only 350 to 400 dollars
more than what it should cost roughly
double roughly double fuck don't do that
let's get a PC part picker it actually
hurts I know it's so feelsbadman see
what PC part picker has to say what are
we looking at what do you want to look
at 70s let's look at 10 70s it's all bad
what's it say 50 TI hey Dad come on look
at that
okay 489 okay almost 150 dollars is it
inside bandits MSRP it is that of stuff
like a blower style design that's gonna
get anyone sees about it stuff oh my god
but but look if it's not in stock at
Amazon for for an Ag you can buy it from
we cannot away from right can we get the
msi can we get the other side for 535
from Amazon 1070 this is a stock sweet
$71 look at the action at ten seventy
five hundred and thirty dollars so it's
like the mini version I know
ITF zero ITX model I mean it kind of
murders super reasonable kind of matters
I have half a cooler on the same GPU as
any other 1070 okay okay let's look at
1080p eyes you gotta go high and what
are your options for the eye and
son of a bitch ball I'm doing this all
to us 9:15
all right 9:15 for the really baseline
MSI 1080 TI armor 915 at new egg it's in
stock look at that look at that oh my
god no wow for a 1080i with that's only
should be about close to 250 250 260
dollars more than it should be hostile
painful that's a whole but it's
important it's important to reality
check these things because you know as
as reviewers you know you don't always
have to go and look at the what what's
available Natalie right yeah so yeah I
mean I'm just letting you guys know
right now any any PC build that I do
from for the next few months is is gonna
be featuring a GPU that I already have
on hand you won't see any new GPU models
or whatever that have come out in the
last few months on my channel because
i'm not spending i have $100 on a gtx
1070 or whatever nor is any adam board
partner mind you going to send me a card
for that price when they can sell it for
that price just to be featured on the
channel so you're stuck with what i have
currently i got an e-mail full
disclaimer i got an email from a company
i can't even remember
x-ray servers i got an email from this
company called x-ray servers basically
saying hey we have all these graphics
cards do you want to advertise them for
us and they sent me a list of graphics
cards and prices that were all 200 to
400 dollars overpriced
based on MSRP and they were kind of like
hey n do you want you know if you want
we can send you graphics cards or
whatever and i was like what kind of
shitty person would i have to be to go
and like advertise yeah
these horrendously overpriced or
graphics cards from this company i've
never heard of called x-ray service when
i know that it's the
significant impact on the graphics card
pricing going on right now is companies
that are going directly to distributors
to buy in bulk hmm that's why there's no
graphics cards available it's not
because people are going and buying five
or ten graphics cards at Fry's or Newegg
or something like that it's because
Ingram Micro Bray and other district
other massive money changers like there
are selling lots of thousands plus
graphics cards yeah to people who are
building crypto mining farms right it's
a whole that's new branch of business
that's where it's coming from
that is I'm like I'm like look smoking
notes I'm still I'm still at the point
where I'm like I'm not gonna I'm not
gonna hate anyone anyone for trying to
make money and if there's a viable way
to make money I don't blame people for
going down that road whatever but I'm
not gonna promote it yeah I'm not gonna
pretend like it's awesome
I'm certainly not gonna be like hey look
at this awesome deal on this gtx 1070
for only $700 when it was $900 last
night I'm gonna pretend like that's a
deal right like that's absurd or
whatever it's not good at the wrong tree
clearly yeah see it for now I'm
promoting impressive AMD APU
yeah I mean I make it and if I make any
build you include a graphics card it's
gonna be like hey here's this build it's
probably whatever priced for most
practical people bittering people are
still you know somewhat interested and
and to see what's available on
everything so yeah there we go
that's that's where I'm at yeah alright
I'm right there with you man cool
I'm glad you agree I hope you guys
appreciate that to some degree and I
like I sympathize anyone who doesn't
have something to work with right now
yeah no shit
but for anyone who does have something
functional right now like don't don't
spend absurd amounts of money and
overpraise stuff right now there's no
system beat you not that's not the way
to do it alright we're gonna end the
show as we always do with some shoutouts
to those with purchased stuff from our
stores it looks like I have five or six

if I haven't plugged into a pin it has
both connector and the molex is ugly
thank you you guys Rock
can I cut a molex connector off of a fan
have it plugged into oh I think I know
what you're talking about my game you're
probably talking about one of the fans
it has two connectors on it it's it's
got one plug that goes down to a little
three pin yeah yeah and it's got a daisy
chain connector that's a molex plug that
hangs off of it it's just giving you
options yes and you cut off the option
you can snip that off just make sure
that you snip it down at the base so
that none of the you don't have any
loose wires hang and that cross with
each other right and yeah you can remove
that yes and no big deal absolutely
cool dust a H 1991 $10 no common thing
tech junkyard $4.99 I have an i7 48 20k
with a GTX 980 do you think I still have
more throughthe have three more years to
play main title games at 144 Hertz 1080p
or update or should an update I think
you have a pretty solid configuration
right there yeah especially given
pricing right now um it's an upgrade is
it's gonna be pretty pretty expensive
for you so yeah I actually think you
have a pretty solid situation oh yeah
nice especially at 1080 you might not be
able to hit 144 FPS and all the games
you're playing
but I mean as long as you're above sixty
it's it's usually a pretty solid
experience and yeah I think you're I
think you're good where you're at yep
thank you and juice wire five Canadians
cave her down
now what about lenses also would GoPros
be good for a webcam for four player
co-op streams would GoPros be good for a
webcam I don't know if GoPros do a clean
HDMI out I have not had that experience
directly if they do then yes if they
don't then no the logitech what c920
it's the one that we stand behind yeah
we use a logitech c920 pretty regular it
was a really nice 1080 resolution it's
not gonna be the sharpest image but if
you're just looking to like capture the
person playing the game so you can take
their you know their their mug and put
it right in super small Susie super high
anyway that's totally fine it's like 60
70 bucks yeah and they're very cost
effective so that's the way I would go
there now that does use a little bit of
your CPU power whatever to handle the
webcam so um there are other solutions
that are external that might be a better
option if you're going for higher end
but beyond that I would say something
like a raise ripsaw and an external
camera with an HDMI out it's clean but
that's gonna be a lot more expensive
solution for you yeah okay I concur
dusty once again 1991 five dollars first
rig after watching your channels that's
arisin five overclocked to 3.9 gigahertz
cooler master master cooler pro 120 AO
gigabyte a/b 350mm coarser LED 3200 16
gigabytes gtx 1066 gigabyte thoughts
you put a rise in 5 GT x 1066 gigabyte i
think you're good there cooler master is
very salt level 120 yeah Alex all I do I
like your setup you have fast memory
which is nice it's nice to pair up with
the resin 5 CPU I'm not sure which resin
5 CPU that you have but I would like to
point out that overclocking and Rison
can be a hit or miss
situation depending on the CPU you have
and the max frequency that you're able
to achieve because sometimes the single
the one or two core overclock that
rising CPUs can hit will get a higher
frequency than what you can hit if
you're doing it all core overclock to
like 3.9 gigahertz yes so if you have a
CPU that by default with the
xfr frequency can go to 4 gigahertz 4.1
gigahertz then it might be worth it for
you to just maintain stock frequencies
because we get a higher frequency on
that one or two cores which would be a
better situation for you for gaming
right but that's not universal it
depends on their chip chip and again
which original CPU and whatnot but 3.9
is definitely a solid overclock anyway
so you've got a nice configuration Thank
You dusty Xue Zhang with the $10 today
good evening guys trying to keep up the
awesome show by the way from last week
Paul you are usually right but my name
is pronounced just like sue sue sue sue
Jean so chow and Cal actually pronounced
my last name correctly it's because I'm
Asian this guy's your my people he's got
the Asian boom same like we're all the
same fan like I'll see you at
Thanksgiving biatch hey I'm glad I was
pretty close that's pretty good which is
which I'm happy but yeah thank you sue
very much for your donation for watching
the show waffle fur $5 donation said the
Ziva gamers X gamers Nexus just crush
ltte cruz 3d mark scores well congrats
it favors Nexus fuck yeah they were
trying to I knew they were gonna they're
trying to shoot out of the water single
GPU scores on multiple things in 3d
market believe and time spy and yeah and
whatnot so yeah watch some friendly
competition there sure I have some
publications on that pride tomorrow
yep or videos if they're live streaming
right now excelente
and good job proven that they're way
better than the latest actives GG
bitches Jason H $5 donation how does
pairing an i-5 8400 with an MS
GTX gaming X 1066 gigabyte sound that's
great PS assuming so well 520 watts be
enough Headroom totally looking for the
best price to value sounds great and
totally would be my answer yeah 520
what's your totally good with anything
up to a ten seventy so 1066 gig should
just be fine
you saw an eighty four hundred is a
solvable CPU can't overclock it but
still got six cores and pairs nice it
was a thank you Jason finally you guys
probably hear this all the time but my
favorite live stream you this is my
favorite live stream and you guys are my
favorite YouTube channels to keep it the
great work thank you know thanks salute
kids are you my favorite coming third
love you my friend you love you so much
keep you in my heart I agree yeah Baha
truck guy at $5 donation says keep up
the awesome work I have an r3 1200
overclocked to 4.1 gigahertz should
upgrade wins n plus drops yes it's in a
gaming rig that's a tough call to make
right now since your overclock the 4.1
gigahertz that's a pretty solid
overclock on an hour through 1200 1200
so yeah keep an eye on the the Zen plus
when it launches its you've only got
about a month left and what frequencies
we're hitting right we're already
expecting based on the early leaks and
stuff that the top-end CPUs will be
running it about 4.3 5 gigahertz mm-hmm
on and on the top ends so that's not too
much faster than a four point one
gigahertz on your internet a 1200 and
we're not expecting like a huge
instructions per clock difference either
Roo so you might just be fine with your
I 3 1200 yeah I think it's gonna boil
down to like quarry utilization if there
are any games coming out later in 2018
that are gonna utilize more than 4 cores
and 4 threads which is what you're
limited at with the 1200 then maybe
consider upgrading to something because
I mean that's that is one of the
benefits that I always talk about about
the am 4 platform is that there's an
upgrade path if you wanted to upgrade
your CPU later down the line because
you've realized some game that you
really want to play this here is
to be able to utilize those courses
optimized to take advantage of
multi-threaded workloads then fucking do
it man
apart from that if you're seeing solid
performance as is then just stick with
what you got and and wear it proudly but
yeah I think you're I think you're in
good shape either way thank you sir
waffle fur but the $5 donation says will
you be reviewing the vive pro it's
really sent releasing on April 5th I do
not have current plans to review the
vive Pro mainly because I just paid
taxes say no more and I just paid say no
more and I'm about to pay for Tesla fire
tesla powerwall solar installation but i
can't wait for that video so I'm making
videos on that but my my work I like
working capital with like which to be
like oh yes I I have not pre-ordered the
vive pro or that I can't I mean I might
have might get it in the future I have a
5 so it makes it a more easy drop-in
right solution if you've already got the
light boxes and everything but I have
not prepared or one yet it's also thing
we're like I would have wanted to be one
of the first pre-orders so yeah right
like be one of the first people who have
it shipped and everything and I wasn't
definitely not that yeah Shane Ellington
donated $24.99 bio break oh okay
no no comment so thank you Shane Scot
Dilbeck 666 have a good night fellas
Cheers
cheers to you too Scott thank you for
donation as always Viking with panda
with five dollars Canadian says I run
triple back and the blog and have been
doing some benchmarking with Numa
pinning and GP pasture VMs have you any
experience with this the dogs are
barking biking with Panda I I have not I
have zero experience with that so if
you're talking about GPGPU pasture VMs
I would say hit up level one text
because I believe
Wendell has dense
work with that of course that depends on
what operating system you're working
with of course he does a lot of work
with Linux banking was painted with
another $5 Canadian donation even while
pinging the VM to a single new monody
QEMU I still see oscillating latency in
between benchmark runs though top topo
Exe patches for SMT biking with panda
again I am NOT in a capacity and a I
can't help you I have not I can't offer
you anything
what's your donation but thank you for
your donation I guess is what I should
boil down to there teddy tech $5
donation says do you gentlemen accept
beer or booze donations if so what is
your favorite beer and/or alcohol of
choice teddy tiger we're pretty open
when it comes to what we're what we
drink you know Pliny the Elder obviously
his obvious is usually a great choice
but if you're interested you can send us
stuff to our Pio boxes we've had that
done before mine I don't know what
Kyle's is he's not here but mine is P o
box for three to five Diamond Bar
California nine one seven six five
Paul's hardware we should send that to
Thank You teddy I'm the doctor
$9.99 says Kyle can we get rile the
entire show sometime I don't know what
Vilas asked him that when he comes back
finally Cory Harden with the five dollar
donation says just upgraded to a rise in
seven 1700 Herrmann 4300 the difference
is ridiculous
lovers show any channels Cory that's
awesome that is like when it comes to
doing something and suddenly making
things way better than they were before
like that kind of upgrade is what I like
to see and I'm I'm I'm ecstatic for you
I share in your enthusiasm for what kind
of an improvement jumping from an FX
4300 to a risin 717 1700 has made Kyle
thank you for being back I'm back can we
get the Ryle the entire show sometime
can we get rile the entire show sometime
oh he's referring to my latest
floatplane video I
hose as Kyle's identical twin brother
right nah trial though it's actually
Lyle a lot which is which happens to be
the American tourists
he says Rio he you know he can't
pronounce his ELLs quite on point
his name's actually Lyle that makes
sense but to the average American here
it sounds like rile but no you will not
see the entire shows never does that
would be too annoying you'll just have
to wait for the video on YouTube no
plans for that no plans
