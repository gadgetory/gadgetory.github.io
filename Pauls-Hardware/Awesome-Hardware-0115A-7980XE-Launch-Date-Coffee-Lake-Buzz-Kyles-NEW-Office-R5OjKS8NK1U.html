why I would keep a bad cable so it so so
hey we should your wise beyond your
years theoretically be live yeah her
life now hello youtube hello everyone
where you going thanks guys for joining
us welcome to awesome hardware this is a
live show that's we talk about
technology we drink some beer sometimes
because sorry about that if you're
offended by it we're gonna talk about a
bunch of stuff today including sky Linux
next-gen 8/8 gin coffee Lake stuff from
Intel we got some new fractal hardware
we got we got lots of fun stuff to talk
about we're gonna stream the first half
of the show this is episode number
hundred and fifteen by the way to my
channel if Paul's hardware and then
about halfway through in about an hour
we're gonna switch over to Kyle's
channel which is called bit wait that's
what it's called still it's the felt
bitman yeah new studio same name so we
are streaming live right now for the
first time the first time anyone has
ever seen the inside of Kyle studio is
right now this exact moment well I mean
I mean I did upload like a video on
ultra and also the thread Ripper
unboxing was here his blindfolded up
somehow so that we can so the reveal
would be people would be sopretty our
authentic reactions you know Italy made
it look like your garage like a year and
a half ago I got inspired my garage look
the way she hit everything I mean the
wall you know they did give a nice even
you know got a layer on the wall my
advisor it's yeah but it looks great now
your your place looks great now so now I
got to step it up I'm gonna try my best
not to cover you exactly like instead of
doing the shelves with like the RGB and
stuff as much as I would like that
because it looks good I'm gonna do
something else I have no idea what but
it's gonna lose elves are my thing I
know you know you already coined shells
into shells you trademark shelves yep
just a dick thing to do
really good shelters will try to
trademark Rio they're very sturdy my
shelves um I believe it anyway we're
just getting the show up and get up and
running right now and so we do a few
things at the beginning of each show
which includes talking about our stores
and if you'd like to help support our
channel so you can check out our stores
and buy some stuff if you if you buy
stuff during the show we'll shout out
your name at the end my store is pulsar
Burnett
I've shirts mugs and pike glasses and
there's new shipping rates I'm gonna
click here to view the new lower u.s.
shipping rates look to the stores yeah
it's it's all in here there's your table
so you get better shipping rates so buy
more things now because of that Kyle's
store is big wait dot tech slash store
he's got the fidgets spinners which that
you've been blowing up hell yeah so
blunted by all the fidget spinners
there's probably like 20 left
also the hats I didn't reply to the
email about the Hat so I don't have any
hands oh yeah I have hats now yeah but
Kyle's got hats
I have hats you're into the hats are a
limited quantity so if you're into hats
literally fact does that then get them
quickly also there's a trucker cap there
was another yeah there's another thing
on the store that I was supposed to
mention what's that John was like make
sure you mentioned this too no it's the
shirt oh yeah the new navy shirt nice
one
it's a maybe tri-blend it's super soft
they are hyper threaded okay so um yeah
that's the best limited edition cool
limited EB not a reptile dysfunction not
erectile 84 edition I've been a dick to
Jon recently I just haven't responded to
him well yeah that's that's why I hired
my Vsauce Oh going on
she's been communicating with yeah yeah
numerous worth every penny can I pay her
some money to do that for me - yeah I
don't see a problem with that okay
figure that out uh goes back to me
anyway alright guys let's start off with
the first segment I might have the show
which is gonna be hot and heavy Harbor
yeah
hardware that's what we're gonna talk
about and biggest and hottest computer
hardware right now no coming soon
possibly no confirmed coming soon and
tell what I'm sorry let's go yeah oh no
Intel's 18 core I 9 78 79 80 x ee the
Extreme Edition it is gonna be launching
September 25th for a cool 2 grand $2,000
we already knew this Intel originally
talked about this at the beginning of
June they were like hey the new skylake
X processors and they're like oh by the
way all those really nice 12 14 16 and
18 core ones those aren't available just
yet
they're coming soon soon ended up being
September 25th for the 18 core 636
thread I 979 ATX II as well as the 16
core 32 thread I 979 60 X that's gonna
be 1700 bucks so 1700 bucks for the 16
core that $700 more than the thread
Ripper 16 core by the way $1,400 for the
14 core 28 thread I 979 40 X those are
September 25th but sooner than that on
August 28th we'll be able to access the
$1,200 12 core well this is 12 core 12
thread but that can't be right it's got
to be 12 core 24 thread that's a tight
bones and it's what yeah yeah 12 core 24
thread I 979 20 X August 28th so that's
relatively soon that's in 20 days it's
right next to the 1900 X Red River it is
which is the 31st of August it is that's
interesting you know we didn't do we
didn't talk about our beer oh yeah real
quick mention of the be arrogant bastard
out for me Gallus trinkets about ballast
point grapefruit sculpin delicious
cheers Cheers thanks meters and all of
you
mm-hmm like these rubber coasters I got
for the deaf they're nice they're very
flimsy but yeah very sturdy that's good
you gotta protect the nice the nice
tabletop here is this the British this
is the bridge I don't I don't know it
was a no I have no idea what I bought I
don't even know how this stuff got your
type of wood is important yeah well I
know you know all about wood now after
your you got wood you've got wood video
I do have more wood now than I had
before
get more wood than all of us come on
seat lots of wood so yeah we saw this
chart here that we saw kind of at the
beginning at the beginning of June end
of May beginning of June has now been
filled out so before it only went up to
79 hundred a hundred x79 20 X 79 forty
seventy nine sixty 79 80
12 14 16 and 18 cord and TD peas are
also now up here so the 79 20 X the 12
Corps is the only one that is still
hundred and forty watt TDP the rest 165
watt TDP coming in less than must read
under the bread Ripper but based on our
knowledge of the seventy nine hundred X
and the temperatures it gets up to
especially with just just a touch of
overclocking I don't know I don't know
if you overclock that TDP number goes
out the window let's put it that way
yeah PCI Express Lanes r44 for all of
these CPUs so good that none of them are
cut down for whatever reason then l3
cache is listed there as well you get it
like ramps up by what like three three
point no 2.75 Meg's per couple cores is
how that it's still obvious base data
yes and that's still 20 fewer PCIe lanes
than third river yeah so I'm just saying
yeah now
the third Ripper for my understanding
four of the piece no action never mind
never mind
oh whoa whoa whoa whoa I don't even know
your right to say no whoa pump the
brakes there buddy whatever you were
about to say talking about that totally
Brown let's talk about look at this
though let's talk about this instead
look at these turbo boost frequencies
mmm so for the 79 80 XE the Extreme
Edition because you know depending on
how many cores are being used
oh geez a turbo a frequency chart gets a
lot longer so for if you're using up to
17 or 18 of the cores in the 79 80 XC
three point four gigahertz is what it
runs at and then 3.5 gigahertz for 13 14
15 and 16 3.9 gigahertz for 11 or 12 and
so on and so forth so entire chart is
there all these stories of are linked in
the video's description if you guys want
to check any of them out further does
that mean if you're let's say you're
running if you're utilizing 16 cores
we'll only no no never mind never mind I
answer my own question never mind it's
good we're good we're gonna can working
things out yeah
all right moving along that's all we
have to say about the sky like heck
stuff but yeah September 25th and August
28th are your dates for those and next
step we have coffee lake more Intel news
Intel's 8th gen coffee Lake this is the
successor to KB Lake this is still gonna
be 40 nanometer CPUs yeah but they're
going to be revealed until today
announced the revelation of a reveal
that will be happening in the future
a revealing review the revelation of the
reveal has been revealed sexy they're
gonna be throwing shade on AMD because
it's gonna happen during the Eclipse on
the 21st because there's a there's an
eclipse on the 21st all of you are
probably aware of that because I don't
know if you guys have been experiencing
this but I have I've heard all about
this eclipse they clips I feel like cuz
aren't people already going crazy about
like where where we're online like on
Twitter I don't know it must be Twitter
maybe that maybe that's it
maybe it's just Twitter
anyway though the Eclipse is on the 21st
so so yeah they can have a live stream
and they're going to reveal a lot more
details we can presume about coffee lake
more details will be revealed later in
this show
assuming that leaks are accurate because
later in the show when we get some news
segment we're going to talk about some
leaked coffee Lake slides for now since
this is hot and heavy hardware and I'm
not I'm not really following the rules
for hot and everywhere but I don't okay
try that new fractal fantasy this is the
defined C tempered glass series fractal
design often reluctant to just jump on
to the bandwagon for the latest trend
but you know after you can see say for
example the transformation that happens
with something I could define our v when
it is lovingly handcrafted and modded to
add a tempered glass side panel window I
mean that's not the type of thing that
just goes by the wayside and people
forget about yes anyway so fractal
adolescent oh you're being serious or
not talking about dependent oh right oh
yeah I got you it's stupid the computer
for the worst-looking computer I've ever
seen shut up it's a good conceit please
Pink Panther Pickett HP Pavilion over
that garbage where's your computer
anyways hotline is still at home it's
the one system I haven't brought over
yet because they still I still love it
too much well anyway this is the define
C tempered glass define CTG and define
mini C tempered glass yay fractal and
tempered glass yes so you got a full
sized ATX as well as a micro ATX version
of this case same case layout same
internals all that good stuff but
tempered glass eye panel window
woo it looks like there's some sort of
covering thing here that's on the
tempered glass up just a clear piece the
black borders a black border going
around the edge next we have the inside
and it looks looks pretty good there and
say with the fractal design aesthetic
already being very minimalist and again
and all that MSRP of 90 and 95 dollars
respectively for the mini and the
standard tempered glass still very
reasonable defined sub $100 price point
for a mid Tower tempered glass case yeah
support CPU air coolers up 272
millimeters graphics cards up to 350
millimeters and power supplies as long
as either than 75 millimeters respect it
seems really familiar Reese for me for
some reason
oh yeah like it just recently hey it's
almost like we yeah let's uh let's move
on though enough about that KB Lake X
right everyone hates it everyone like
nobody likes cable ax we just mentioned
it and like root like because I just
said KB Lake X there's a bunch more your
sounds for your do now as a result I'm
sorry we don't put keeping like X in the
titles anymore yeah so obviously many
factors should cater directly to KB like
X fans there being so many of them out
there video cards dot-com has this
article here about KB Lake X only X 299
motherboards look at that right is
because you guys probably know when you
drop a KB Lake ex-mother
keep it like CPU into an x-men and a
motherboard you can only use half of the
memory slots for example mm-hmm so to
alleviate that pain you can buy one of
these motherboards like the Auris X
$2.99 or as gaming both MSI and gigabyte
are introducing motherboards of this ilk
are they cheaper theoretically
unfortunately this is all the media
cards article so you know grain of salt
we're not positive that this is a thing
but the pictures look pretty convincing
if you ask me know pricing is listed
however but yeah the gigabyte x2 9 and a
Taurus gaming here's an ATX motherboards
got four dimm slots rather than the
traditional eight that you would get or
two on each side with with the with an
actual high-end desktop motherboard
three PCIe slots couple em about two
connectors you can only use an i7 77 40
X or 76 40 X in this
the article says only like I would be
curious like obviously you don't want to
but like if you put you know right this
is 1778 20k or somebody 20x in there or
something would it boot up what did that
right work I don't know I don't know
maybe not I mean the article says no so
yes that's all we know for now I don't
know I feel like it Jim yeah it should
still because there are still people who
want an upgrade path and that was like
but if you want an upgrade path to
Buffalo's buy it by a fully capable
extra man and a motherboard so any
upgrade you can actually use
quad-channel memory and everything like
that yeah but what if you can't afford
that type of mother bear we're gonna
argue this further in a few minutes
oh but like you have a dedicated segment
on your half of the show that's baby
yeah controversial talk to that Michelle
MSI's version is called X 299 m - a pro
it's micro ATX so I guess it makes a
little bit more sense same config pretty
much as far as their connectivity goes
em about - and expansion slots except
you lose the PCIe by one slots and again
no pricing on either of these so all you
guys who have been like man I've got my
seven I've got my 77 40 X bought it
right right when it was available just
waiting for the right motherboard where
I won't be too disappointed when I
install it your day has arrived I've
been waiting oh you're not quite yet
your day is coming soon Oh Lord like you
that's a good match EPE that's a good
that's a good segue I like I'm here all
week should have we should have musical
segment singing segues to everything so
yeah we're moving to the next segment
savings so saying so could
this segment is good say it ain't so
usually stories of bad things or things
that maybe seems like they would be one
way but then it turns out it's really
not that way at all
nope also credit just full credit and a
link in the description to level one
text because I watched their new store
news show Wendell and team over there
what's it called level one Tech's the
new show the show though is just called
I think it's just level one news oh
right that anyway but they posted there
their video yesterday so I stole like
most of these stories from that from
them just just straight-up good good
people to steal from though yeah I'm
gonna steal information steal it from
those guys yeah and there's a lot more
terrible things that are going on in the
world that you can learn about from
their show so again link in the
description mob let's start out with
Verizon's new rewards program which also
just so happens to track your browsing
history so if you guys have any family
members who aren't so tech-savvy and
might have heard about this new program
for from Verizon maybe give them a heads
up about Verizon up that is the name of
this new program that's a terrible name
is called Verizon up terrible Verizon up
the rides in a resident Oh Brad nook in
the stream did my chances yeah yeah
that's we're gonna get flag that's gonna
get the content you're right you're a
hot no or see much so OnPoint is so
accurate taoism confused
so fries enough well actually so the
plan on its face seems kind of cool it
Awards users of credit for every 300
dollars they spend on that Verizon bill
and you can redeem that credit towards
various rewards the device dollars used
towards your next device purchase you
can use for discounts on accessories or
for partner awards so it seems like a
very nice occasional thing to get for
regularly paying your cell phone bill
however you also have to enroll in
Verizon selects a program that allows
Verizon to track personal data and
Lutie web browsing app usage device
location service usage demographic info
postal or email address and your
interests so raisin selects does not
sound nearly as good as a Verizon up I
regret my new candy you can't even miss
a song off of breath selects Verizon up
there's a roll off the drum X all your
data
I think this ID is really dumb Verizon
downloads it to our servers
yeah that's pretty that's right with NSA
yeah well yeah that's you're right it
gets worse yeah because it's not just
Verizon and for anything it's the data
but not just Verizon they also are
allowed to share it with with oath for
monies which you may have heard about
oath is the newly-formed combination of
AOL and Yahoo put together it makes us
both turns out it is it seems like
there's gonna be a bunch of services
that do data tracking and stuff like
that that's what earth is turning into
but yeah so it allows them to share the
data with oath as well as vendors and
partners who will work with Verizon so
nobody signed up for Verizon up oh and
by the way if you already are part of
Verizon smart rewards program you're
already signed up for all this so
you're already getting tracked and
everything like that
jaysus anyway next up on say it ain't so
you guys have an echo have you tried to
echo I have not but I've been interested
in it you've been interested I keep I
keep wanting to convince myself that I
need it and I always go back to no I
don't need this well I don't know maybe
you can convince me one way or the other
Paul
I don't either and even less so after
this now to be clear this this thing
which is hackers hacking into an Amazon
echo to convert it into a listening
device while it also maintains all the
same functionality that I had before so
you don't know super stuff going wrong
yeah it's only works on the 2015 and
2016 editions of echo okay not the
newest 2017 edition so everyone update
your echos give it a month
it also requires actual physical access
to the device
hello that makes it seem a little bit
less nefarious however if someone does
have physical acts
to the device and this was researched by
M WR info security mobile they can
compromise the Amazon echo to turn it
into a covert listening device and again
it still functions just like it did
before so you have no idea that
anything's wrong the attack involves
physical access they remove a rubber
base at the bottom of the echo to access
18 debug pads and directly boot into the
firmware of the device via an external
SD card it allows them to gain a root
shell on the Linux operating system to
install malware these info security
company did a full examination of the
process running on the device and the
Associated scripts then they were they
investigated how the audio media was
being passed and buffered between the
processes and the tools used to do so
they then developed scripts that
leverage tools embedded in the device to
stream the microphone audio to a remote
server without affecting functionality
the raw data was then sampled via remote
device and the decision could be made to
just play it out of the speakers or save
it as a WAV file sounds like something a
super psychotic jealous boyfriend would
do to his girlfriend because you would
need personal access Jewish to the
attacker boyfriend yeah jealous hacker
boyfriend who doesn't trust his
significant other and if I wasn't you
obviously need personal FaceTime girl
and I was dating and dude and I found
out he was like a hardcore hacker I'd be
able to have freaked me out a little bit
oh yeah no no no I've seen Silicon
Valley yeah I know that I know how that
ends but yes so that obviously sucks and
obviously this is one of those scenarios
that when devices like the echo came out
and you're like oh how cool you just
talk to it you say things and it
responds and answers your questions and
it knows things about you and stuff like
that it knows the first concern yeah and
there's also potentially nefarious
things that can be done with it so I
mean obviously this is a case in point
and an actual example of that happening
but again newest 2017 edition apparently
has some other protection around those
acts that the pads that they're
accessing to get into debug mode or
whatever I think the echo is also like
extra shady because it doesn't have like
you don't connect the monitor to it it's
all audio there's
there's no way even if you were tech
savvy like I don't know if like you
could actually like look up a list of
processes that were running or something
like that
maybe there was a way to do that for the
echo but I just feel like it's maybe
even harder to detect well there was a
no visual aspect the article does
include and the article is from help net
security comm by the way but it does
have a few risk mitigation things you
can do if you have an echo and you're
like holy crap my echo has this right
like maybe there's somebody out there
item number one destroy it immediately
well you might not need to do that first
off you can make use of the mute button
so if you know you're not gonna be using
it or off-hours or something like that
mute it and then it's not listening
anymore
they also have an echo version that you
that like you have to touch in order to
turn it on which i think makes a lot
more sense monitor for unusual
activities you can do trace routes and
that kind of thing to see where Internet
network traffic is going and if there's
network traffic going at times that
where it shouldn't be where nothing else
should be going on and then definitely
purchase only directly from Amazon or
trusted retailers because this is
something where like hey I got a really
good deal on my echo from some like
shady ass company because oh yeah yeah
like you're saying I the echo from trust
yes only by the echo that's directly
from Amazon are just retailer because
yeah there's certainly been problems
with compromised devices being sold or
passed very certain when you go in the
marketplace sellers and hoonigan places
like Amazon that kind of thing you might
buy from even yourself up to more risk
yeah or I'm buying on eBay or something
like that you're good if you're such a
good deal bros like like hacker 35 0
like 69 69 latest rate from russia yeah
he's got like at least just sixty
percent approval even their packaging
was open there's some wires sticking out
the back seems to work alright moving on
now we freaked that anyone who's using
an echo everyone's just gone ahead and
destroyed their destroy it alright so
copy like CPUs right we talked about
those a little bit or any of you guys
possibly already using a skylake or kb
lake cpu on the main stream platform
with the z170 yearsI 270 chipset and the
l
I am 51 socket and thought yourself hmm
these coffee like stuff sounds pretty
interesting they might be doing hexa
Coors on it maybe I want to upgrade
you're probably not gonna be able to do
that in fact too as rock as well as
according to Gordon's contacts directly
from Intel the new copy Lake CPU will
not be compatible with z2 70 boards boo
this original information came directly
from asrock who was asked about it on
Twitter
Evan Jensen from at from asrock was
asked will does e 270 supercarrier get
support for the upcoming Intel Catholic
CPUs as rx official Twitter account
replied no copy Lake CPU is not
compatible with 200 series motherboards
so Jamis that sucks for anyone who was
considering that as a potential upgrade
path it also sucks considering Intel has
been suffering from a pretty constant
slew of negative press recently due to
some of their decisions and the fact
that there's competition now and people
have choices and that kind of thing so
I'm sure this isn't gonna sit well with
a lot of people because it also goes
back to some like historical criticisms
of Intel like that on their mainstream
platform they've had really bad
situations in the past or they've
introduced a new platform and then a
like a year later like well right before
Sandy Bridge was um no um no no no the
mainstream it was LGA 1156 I want to say
anyway the the the generation right
before before Sandy Bridge was like a 1
year generation processor and I'm sure
Gulf town I'd have to look up the
history right it was in my head at one
point but anyway point being that kind
of sucks for anyone who was looking for
an upgrade path and especially anyone
who was like hey cuz I like I could see
someone who invested in z170 when it
first launched being Linfield
Lynn Lynn field that might be ya
Linfield's Westmere Wes Peter spoon I
think it's Westmere brent killa i think
you're right in absolutes west me
anyway it sucks for anyone who was
looking forward to hexa Coors and hoping
not to have to buy a new motherboard
yaps their system at least with any
muscle so does that mean is there
confirmation on if coffee legs gonna use
the same socket no I mean but that's not
a that hasn't been confirmed yet as far
as we know apart outside of rumors the
socket size and everything looks exactly
the same it might even be the exact same
ping count I'm not sure if they're gonna
put anything physically into the socket
to block putting one cpu type or another
if they're gonna slightly change the
layout or the keying of the CPU itself
socket 1150 - well I'm just - just
because you baby maybe something
like that
Thanks intel socket 1150 - because we
love money yeah that's possible - crap z
370 is the anticipated name of the
chipset for the copy link compatible
CPUs when they come up and it says yeah
although coffee Lake is based on the
same 40 nanometer processes cable they
can scale a can appears to use the same
chipset it's believed to be Intel's
first six core chip and a mainstream
platform so this is a reason I mean if
you want to look at it from Intel's
point of view then take the brief a
second - trying to do that this is a
reason why there might be an actual
reason for them to not be compatible so
it's totally possible the Intel may have
never planned for Z 272 support the
power requirements of copulate or a six
core processor and if this is as a lot
of people have you know claimed and
pointed out a reaction to AMD's launches
and a lot of the stuff that i'm done it
AMD has done in the market you know in
2017 then yeah you could easily go back
as far as z170 and even z2 70 and say
they didn't really intend this for
something like what they're doing with
coffee leak or you could just say Intel
sucks and they hate customers and go
that route to it I'm wondering how much
more negative press they like Intel
really needs to to be bashed with before
they start changing their the same
business model that they've kind of run
with for the last five years or so
because I mean and it could be like
coffee Lakes been in the works right
it's not like they just started it last
week like they could have already been
planning or coffee like to be on a
completely separate socket or
motherboard way before Rison even like
took storm or whatever yeah so I mean so
it's gonna take a while for for the
response I feel like it's gonna take a
while for Intel's true response to all
the crazy that AMD has been doing
this year because like coffee Lake and
all those like the technologies that are
coming out this year were probably
forged way long ago you know they have a
long road map usually yeah but that
sounds interesting anyway you know sorry
to disappoint anyone with that news if
that's something you were actually
looking forward to oh dang Anna just
closed the link for manic story hold on
one second anymore be anymore be a blue
back Kyle's wife Heather is here and she
has promised to bring us more beer
during the show if we need it so that's
pretty cool
all right here is the next story which
is the final story in the Satan's soft
segments which is about our ex Vega this
is another video cards calm story and
Vega 64 apparently potentially might be
really good for mining and that might be
really bad news for anyone who might
have potentially wanted to buy a Vega
GPU this is the etherium mining
benchmark which was actually run by tech
spots so that this might have been
Steve's benchmarks actually anyway so if
they're your mining benchmarks are
showing that the hash rates for a lot of
the different GPUs out there going all
the way up to 390 x10 XP 10 1080i hash
rates in the 28 to 30 ish range is the
top of the range right there Vega might
have a hash rate of like 7200 mega
hashes per card which is really high I
mean even if it's in the 60 to 70 range
that's pretty damn good so good news if
you're a minor and especially if you
have some kind of access to Vega but bad
news for anyone who's hoping that Vega
might be a card that you could just
decide to buy once you have the money
available or something like that
it's looking like when Vega does become
available at retail that they're
probably gonna sell pretty quick so if
you're thinking about getting Vega it's
gonna be a good thing to pay close
attention to launch dates when retailers
might actually put stuff up for sale
pre-sale even I mean we hate to
recommend presale but in this markets
with the way GPUs are going that might
be something that you just need to do in
order to reserve yourself one the Vega
performance is said to be somewhere
around that of a GTX 1080 and the
pricing has come out for Vega 56 and
Vega 64 at 400 bucks and 500 bucks and
sort of in that range there's also the
Vega packs that you can get the Radeon
packs you can get I was gonna say I
wonder how that's going to help people
who are not just looking to upgrade
their there GPU but like the core
components with like a rice and CPU and
XSV board definitely seems so like the
thing that I thought that I didn't catch
at the time was that the the monitor you
get is like one monitor it's like that
single one monitor one model which is
very model that you can get Turner bucks
on I thought it was 200 bucks off of any
freesync monitor I'm Sam's hell yeah
even even there's still a B okay yeah
sure it's just that one monitor right
and that's a $750 monitor right and you
got a really low and summer viewers
we're looking at that monitor right is
AMD was talking about that at that
events yeah and new eggs price had gone
up for it nine hundred and fifty dollars
right $200 the exact same amount of each
case I have not followed up on Atticus
hey wait but still 100 bucks off of
horizon CPU motherboard combo is that I
mean that's good yeah so if you're
getting all that at the same time then
yeah that that's definitely something
that's possible what worries me is that
it's select rise in seven CPUs and so if
they are only granting that that voucher
for like the 1700 X or the 1800 X
basically like the CPUs that I've
advised people against buying because
they're not the best value that would
does it apply to the 17
yeah I don't know I don't know I don't
know it'll be it'll be interesting to
see how they how they cut it up and
stuff okay well anyway that's all for
that segment my face in the in the
screen see how there's a light oh yeah
the Sun is setting in of a bitch like
the California sunset here that you guys
get to experience as reflected on Kyle's
face the blinds are closed but there's
just one little crack
that's just blaring into my face I need
to get one of those roller like the same
roller curtain that I had it at my old
place sorry you don't like the sunlight
well I don't mind the sunlight but it's
distracting from the viewers there's
like strip of wow cows and I was brown
in that one section spaces make me
rethink just who he is this person we're
moving on to Dodger the next segments
here which is going to be sword fight
where Cal and I argue about something
we're gonna have a quick argument here
and I've just posted a straw poll link
into the videos and now into chat it's
in the video description too if you're
watching this in the future you can
still vote right
no one goes and looks at it in the
future though so is your vote will be
futile and no one will see what happens
however Street ultimately in the grand
scheme of things you'll feel better
about yourself so um here's a question
we're going to talk about we already
mentioned these Cabul eight X only X
amount and and motherboards so I just
wanted to get you guys feedback on it
great idea or the greatest idea I may
have a few options to your great idea
greatest idea or third option for people
who so we're so worried
we can't go with the third option I'm
guessing right because no no we gotta
choose one of the other of the first two
yeah okay I'm gonna say great idea solid
but I'm not gonna put my head up Intel's
ass on this Paul because you know what
would even make it the greatest idea
ever just throw it away she'll money
dude the greatest idea ever would be if
they had just put KB like X on Z to 70
in the first place instead of dumbing
watering down in X to 99 motherboard so
that it's basically a Z to 70
board for z2 70 price and saying look at
what we did for you guys we made it more
convenient and sensible because we
 up we realize that and all the
backlash like they clearly Intel clear
this is one of those after thoughts like
Intel didn't think that they had to do
this right up front again I'm still
arguing for a great idea
so still solid idea but it could be
greater Intel was like oh there's a
lot of uh they had to put out a fire
they had to put out a huge freaking fire
with KP like X and X to 99 and realized
yet we should have just put this on our
mainstream platform in the first place
because users the other day aren't
getting a high end desktop experience
maybe they're getting the upgrade path
but at the same time they're not getting
the additional PCIe lanes they're not
getting more you know expansion or
storage options as they would with a
true xx $2.99 chip for example so I
think it's a you know the it's it's a
money game it's a money game that Intel
has been playing for a long time because
they haven't really had much competition
until this year and now they're starting
to sweat a little bit and they're
starting to cater a little bit more to
the the end user but really just to
cover up their tracks because they've
already been found out and on so
much by the community and them no I
love Intel I love Intel I love them but
bad move bad bad it's just a bad year
it's just a bad year for Intel but you
know what we have bad years we have bad
months bad weeks it's ok until it's
gonna be alright it's gonna be ok and
eventually you know one day I'll make a
terrible parody about what AMD is doing
and and on Amy's head but for now
it's you you know Cal I've had a bad
last three minutes cuz I've had to sit
here and listen to that god-awful tripe
spill out of your mouth you know to
defend your position in saying that this
was not the greatest idea the best idea
ever that's been conceived of in the
possible length of human history since
consciousness was achieved preacher Paul
preached by our people testify now if
you're Intel right obviously you're
sitting on the Lord
pile of money and you're like what do we
need to even bother doing anything
anymore for we've made all the
processors people have them they can do
what they want with them
 the people right but no intel is
generous they're kind they're loyal and
they provide people with options and
that is the essence of what the greatest
idea ever is actually all about is
providing people with choice you don't
want people to have a choice Kyle is
that what you're saying yeah yeah and
your choice in your assessment of this
as only the a great idea and that the
greatest idea yeah no I think that is
wrong I think that is false Camie like X
only motherboards are obviously filling
a niche in the marketplace that has long
been void providing attention to a
segment of customers that have been
neglected living in the shadows and now
their time has come
yes I'm talking to you
KB like X fan yeah your your time has
come
rise up like a fan like that but and
power I'm running out of steam here all
right you get my point
let's see what people think right you've
lost so much team your Haven would be
disappointed boom that's pretty good
results from Herald week it's okay it's
okay man it's okay I guess followed by
the greatest idea ever it's true but but
look at that oh I win
technically I win but you know what all
those people who voted it's okay I guess
it's only because you didn't have an
option that said this is the worst this
is very good we make response usually we
get a lot more votes than this I think
yes yeah the people didn't didn't want
to vote for any of these options well
it's still what 500 E's are the only
choices that could possibly could
possibly come up with when it comes to
an idea like KP like X on a motherboard
stuff obviously all right let's close
off my half of the show with some some
good old standardized to tech news in
your faces
mm-hmm early GUI and all that so we are
we've already talked about coffee like a
decent amount on this
and coffee lake slides have leaked this
was actually posted yesterday this is a
techspot article and these slides
presumably are from an insult
presentation they certainly look fairly
legit I'm trying to make them bigger so
you guys can actually see them but the
source is from a Chinese website called
PC Eva PC Eva Eva does not like EVA Air
yet that that would be any relation of
interesting so coffee like as has
already been expected as featuring hexa
core CPUs six core processors on the
mainstream lineup 24 PCIe lanes although
that is via the chipset which is
essentially I believe that's what the
same thing you get with Z 270 right
yeah that's a broken-off four lanes yeah
that's the same thing it was easy 270 so
it's broken off four lanes directly from
the troops which the CPU VP you search
then goes into the end of the chipset
the DMI whatever the version of DMI
they're on Jimmy hey um Kavya I guess
maybe the first series to be a part of
these 370 chipsets and then potentially
following up with a cannon like refresh
so even though these CPUs are coming up
fairly quickly when you compare it when
you consider that skylake only came out
at the beginning of 2017 you can see
here and the desktop product roadmap
2017 and then 2018 the sky like X and KB
leaked X filling in the top line of the
high-end desktop segment KB like s right
now being replaced by coffee like s soon
but then potential you by the end of q1
2018 which isn't that far off coffee
lightweight that's also copied I guess
if you can in like PCH more SKUs from
copula guess maybe a troll or I feel
like any team I guess and then on the
end Series process this so yeah six and
four core fruit for q3 and q4 six and
four core and then it goes six four
there's gonna be a refresh box
cannon lake I thought oh yeah so coffee
lake so this is can like PCH
the cannon leaked the chipset and that's
strange I don't know I don't have it
here but that exactly it's confusing
confused
okay who's confuse 'old point is the
chipsets show copy that guess extending
too many year 2018 and then yeah we
might see cannon Lake CPUs on these in
2018 who knows at what point that might
happen that chart seems to indicate
something some pretty somewhere pretty
close to the beginning big beginning of
2018 which might be like a CES timeframe
often they try to line these up with
larger trade shows that kind of thing
but the chipset that as it launches is
gonna have support for some cool stuff
like six PCIe gen3 I'm sorry PCIe I'm
gonna talk about six PCIe that's
supposed to be a say you see USB I'm
sorry USB Oh PCIe three reason that's
like what is that that makes no sense
six USB 3.1 gen2 ports I would have a
total of ten at USB 3.1 over all
available ports but when coffee lake s
comes out so maybe there'll be a refresh
of z3z 370 motherboards this is where it
gets very confusing coffee like s
refresh is gonna support USB 3.1 gen2
because you all know USB 3.1 gen2
gen one is way better than USB 3.1 gen2
gen zero yes yes USB 3.2 gen one is the
new that's really good 20 megabits
per second Jenny gigabits per second
whereas gen USB 3.0 sucks now cuz it's
only 10 gigabits per second I believe
that's correct
wait so you're saying were you saying
USB 3.1 gen2 Gen 2 or Gen 1 were you
using to Jen's in one thing no point two
oh three points two point one and three
point two ah-ha-ha-ha-ha to say 3.2 gen
weather
get mixed around anyway yeah I was
reading the note some gen one this USB
the naming has gotten so confusing it's
really an irritating yeah anyway also
also Thunderbolt 3.0 with DisplayPort
support for quad-core audio digital
signal processing as well will be added
in the Refresh but not necessarily
available for this stuff from copulate
coming out this year so I get confused
was the USB 3 was USB 3.1 gen2 a thing
where it was tends a USB 3.1 just is
five gigabits per second right because
it was like a glorified USB USB 3.1 gen2
was attending a bits per sec on it okay
USB 3.0 jet and one is going to be
twenty thousand twenty yeah yeah pretty
sure that's correct okay I am assuming
that I mean I sure hope that's correct
okay couple more quick stories to talk
about in the tech news am DS Vega is
coming very soon and Asus is allegedly
potentially possibly going to be doing a
dual GPU version of it it's indeed so on
something akin to this with Mars for
Aries Aries Aries Mars there's is Nvidia
oh yes yeah so this is the results of
AMD giving Adam board partners the green
lights take freedoms and design custom
graphics cards based on Vega 10 GPUs
which includes the Vega 10 XT which is
the full fat 64 competing at a chip as
well as the Vega 10 XL which is a
smaller 56 compute unit chip that's
going to be used on the Radeon Vega 56
now asus has done done this in the past
they have an aries series of graphics
parents actually I wanted to pull up
some images of those hold on hold on I'm
gonna do a google image search there's a
little fan it's a little looking fan for
the big ass car this water-cooled well I
know yeah yeah but it still this is very
this is aces as Ares 2 and this was a
very early water-cooled graphics card
and they had
to a Steck pump pump block combo units a
very small fan in there and this was to
Radeon HD 7970 GPUs in their massive
power delivery configuration on it and
everything like that so theoretically
asus is now developing something like
this something akin to this we don't
know if it's gonna be called Ares 4
there was also an Ares 3 that launched
with a two hour - r9 290 s in the same
card and that was water block a
completely water cooled card that was
the actual circuit board for it but - r9
290x is on it but you know again these
are limited edition graphics cards that
Asus makes they're very special so
usually that numbered and that kind of
thing so potentially in Ares 4 and the
works with twofold Vega 10 XT GPUs the
64 compete unit versions would have over
50 teraflops of floating-point 16
compute power 25 teraflops of FP 32
nearing 600 watts of power draw on the
limited edition the TP of the vega the
RX vega 64 is - 95 watts and air-cooled
version and 350 watts in the
water-cooled version so combining those
together with two GPUs depending on
clock speeds and that kind of thing
you're looking at something in the 600
possibly even more than that range as
far as power draw and CVP required
probably a limited edition card and ya
know I mean there's no pictures or
anything like that of it yet so not sure
if they're gonna go with the full
water-cooled option like what the ek
block like they did before or do
something that's like like the areas to
where it's includes a an all-in-one
radiator and everything like that so
it'd be a little bit I mean it'd be
cooler but it would be more limiting if
it was just a water block version that's
true because you'd have to buy a bunch
of other for it
yeah III would like to see it as
something like the residual areas to
where the r9 295x2 or something like
that
alright one last story here to mention
real quick there was a bit of a
kerfuffle online about not to of fans
and Noctua fans that are sourced from
multiple locations there's fans from
Noctua that come from Taiwan
there's also fans from back to it that
come from mainland China and the
accusation was that they're different so
wait so same model of fan but um two
different actor gotcha
and there is a reddit post where there
was some very specific things pointed
out as far as differences between the
two fans so gamers Nexus Steven company
got ahold of a decent number of these
fans source different locations they did
some side by side comparisons and the
article as well as the video are both
linked in the description because they
did some testing they actually have it
this like series of testing lined up and
they only went part way through it
because ultimately what they decided was
the same spoiler alert
well yeah functionally they're the same
you can see here manufactured in China
the one on the left and manufactured in
Taiwan is the one on the right and
there's actually some difference in the
coloration because they different dyes
and that kind of thing from different
parts of the world mm-hmm
however when it comes to actual
functionality it does appear that the
Chinese sourced fans from mainland China
do perform just as equally as well as
the ones from Taiwan it's a good job Jim
demons Nexus Jamie's Nexus series next
good job gamers Nexus now your gamers
with their with their thorough testing
and everything another another excellent
article by them check it out if you guys
are interested we're gonna round up my
half of the show by answering some
questions that people have answered in
Chet asked masked and Chet which
theoretically have been being gathered
by no properties they answered their own
questions so be kind of convenience cell
processing our excellent moderator who's
been gathering these thank you so we're
out some automatic met our first
donation of the day Ted
that was verbal I'm okay
$10 from automatic met hey guys join the
army and I
ship out on September 18th for three
months with no internet so except expect
bigger donations ex-model bless you
sorry also please do the tour Kyle mhm
TPC Paul before I ship yeah that the
office story for sure some temperatures
okay oh yeah of course that's coming
soon htpc theoretically if frickin if
stuff would stop launching there's
launches I know what's happening we have
no free all right I'm gonna take care of
that I'm gonna get through that and we
have a benchmark all that stuff and then
I'm gonna get okay oh god there's
another one right at me well all of you
are at home going like yeah a new big
lunch from Intel or AMD like all of us
reviewers just so you know every time we
see work like oh yeah there it goes like
there goes my month of August September
stuff and everything it's been so so
non-stop so yeah thank you for your
service automatic matter yes your
service and who and all that depending
on where you going
mmm-hmm Scott six dollars and sixty six
cents would doom guy or Duke Nukem win
in a fight Paul finisher HTPC already
and Kyle steak and Curtis thanks ladies
so Paul as he mention news finishing his
HTPC doom guy or do I want to say Duke
Nukem just cuz I feel like there's more
personality there and I just yeah if you
like there's more there's little bit
more going on he wins for character
points I'd say there yeah agree like if
they were characters in a movie like
you'd bought you yeah that would be the
one who you use yeah cuz you actually
get to see like Duke Nukem face and hear
what he says doing guys just a nameless
asshole he's pretty bad he's pretty bad
uh uh I guess you see doom guys face in
the older dooms right but you don't
really see him yeah you do man the face
is in the middle and as you get hurt he
gets more bloody right so I guess we
kind of know any looks we know what
8-bit we know what he looks like in a
bit back world
El Jefe reviewers buenos nachos nachos
should not just some great way no it's
no good nachos indeed as the translation
should I pair my 7,700 came with the gtx
1070 or wait and see what RX vega is all
about certainly seems like you should
wait at this point they get
d6 I think if your your eyeball on gtx
1070 right now vega 56 based on the
price points would probably be more or
less comparable and in terms of
performance i secretly didn't get it
speaking giving get one and also and
also vega 56 would save you money on a
free sink panel that is a very true over
a g-sync equivalents and considering a
variable refresh rate monitor then andy
is definitely worth that if you can buy
a card at MSRP and that's yeah that's
just the ab a you have to put in every
time is the right yeah that'd be a good
option for you
Holt Hamlet what five dollars I need a
motherboard for a 2,300 2,300 what is
that like it like a Sandy Bridge 2300
like an i3 is that a Sandy Bridge chip
yeah 2500 KS oh oh right right there was
an i3 Cori 2300 you might have a
difficult time you need to find a piece
67 or a z77 motherboard you can get away
with the age 67 it's a core i5 actually
that's an i-5 yeah yeah yeah
motherboards motherboards seem to be the
more difficult thing to find as things
get older yeah but for mainstream you
might have a slightly more easier time
but yeah yeah I mean you look into eBay
and you're looking at a very limited
number of stock as far as what's
available so I wish you the best of luck
he's that quad-core alright alright
thank you very much garand
5 bucks is there any reason for coffee
like not being compatible as e70 other
than to force me to buy a new
motherboard at this point we don't
really know but I mean we'll try to get
more info from from Intel or yeah
hopefully they'll give more explanation
but I mean this help you looks the same
like the actual we don't know I mean
outside it's rumors and stuff at this
point so we're not really sure I mean
the what Intel will probably say and we
probably never know absolutely for sure
if it's true or not is that you know
it's a 6 core you know there's some
power requirements or some thing with
the socket design or something that
needed to be different for for
the 6 core and that's why we had to
change and it'll be up to you whether
you believe them or not yeah but yeah it
could also easily be
were a big company and we realize that
forcing people to buy new motherboards
means that we make more money and so
that's why we did it that's probably why
I don't know seems less cynical yours
yeah CCM what up Chris five dollars Paul
are you planning on using stainless
steel screws and motherboard standoffs
if so I can get you a deal on them
through my work okay
I have a set of brass screws right and I
bet brass standoffs right now that I got
they're fairly ghetto bristly I'll try
to hit you up because yeah that'd be
nice I've that's what I've been thinking
about is mounting stuff and various
options for that and routing cables and
I don't know it's I feel like I feel
like there's a breakthrough moment
that'll happen for me soon and then I'll
be able to move on with it but you know
it's it's I'm putting a lot of thought
into it I guess Mike dude dudes five
dollars would you trust or use a
publication to help you choose your
parts for your PC build like maximum PC
or boutiques like origin PC or if in DC
I mean they put boots together if you're
willing to pay the extra money for it
boutique system builders build really
nice systems and they're often backed by
pretty good warranties and they often
have I mean I can't speak for all the
boutique builders but often they only
become successful by having good service
so if you need to call them about
something you can so you do get
something for your money there but you
do have to pay extra as far as a
publication to help choose parts I mean
PC part picker does a great job with the
compatibility filters and stuff that it
has right there and less chance for a
bunch of different parts from different
retailers to find help you find a good
price and then you mentioned maximum PC
or like sites like maximum PC PC game or
that kind of thing they'll often have
like here's our recommend it's you know
mid-range thousand dollar world yeah
that kind of thing those are often
really good starting off points so you
can see right here's the list of parts
that I know work together yeah I don't
like the case they chose let me find
something else yeah that's in the same
price range
those are often really good starting off
points for that kind of thing yeah check
your tile all five dollars by bush I
could watch but editing a video you guys
are great
love you all right Andy
pee-yew right Verizon needs the GPU you
know a GPU I'm guessing if you're saying

five dollars and one cent how much do I
have to tip you tip for you to send me
your Corsair 380 T man I don't have a
green tea so that must be drink again I
get requests for that 380 T pretty
pretty frequently actually case yeah
because they don't make them anymore
yeah they're really hard to find like
Corsair stop making them are they
selling for a hefty amount now yeah I
mean if you if they actually go up like
pristine ones or that kind of thing on
eBay they usually sell for 3 or 400
bucks
really Brendan I like my 380 tea right
now so I have no plans to sell it in the
immediate future but I will keep your
offer in mind if I do change my mind
what I mean aren't they like still
making cases way older than that uh yeah
I don't know like you can still buy a
600 T yeah like it which is even I mean
there's also some cases they just
produced a lot more of so there's a lot
more surplus yeah there were 380 let's
see what happens if we write 3 ATT and
Amazon nothing it's not even there
nothing is 600 T a case that's what
seven eight years old now is more
accessible than your 380 T you you hold
