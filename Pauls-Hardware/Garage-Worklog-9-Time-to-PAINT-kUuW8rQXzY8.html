were clogged so here's the garage it's
looking very nice as you might have seen
in the last garage were clogged it's
been fantastic have an actual space out
here and move around and get work done
not feel like I'm claustrophobic or
anything but what I'm doing today is is
mainly on this side of the garage I'm
gonna paint these walls I'm also gonna
paint part of this cabinet here and then
I can actually start putting stuff in
there because there's really nothing in
there also I you know I got to do stuff
like there's a little Nick's in the wall
so I'm gonna sand and cover some of that
stuff up I have like oh here's my
creative way of covering my my sockets
as a couple sockets here and behind
Sherlock data over there and so I'm
gonna do some coverings to bring those
down shelves are gonna go I'm probably
gonna do two rows of shelves here in
here and it's gonna it's gonna be
absolutely fantastic but the thing that
is really the end goal here which is
starting over on this side this little
pile is all of well not all of but a lot
of the stuff that I moved out of here to
make everything look so neat and clean
where's the rest of it you may ask oh
god it's on here that's right all of
this stuff this is my stuff it's
organized there's like cases are over
there and components that kind of thing
look see it's Christmas you got got the
tree goin I haven't turned it on yet
because it's still daytime outside no
he's over here on the couch I know he
and also I just got this this metabones
adapter that I could use my my Canon
lenses my EF lenses my gh4 it's kind of
nice I like it anyway let's go get some
paint
he's hardware
paint and speckle let's get to it
hey guys it's day two now day one is
complete night one as well because I did
work well into the night last night but
I got a single coat down as well as some
other stuff let's take a look at what I
actually accomplished so far so here's a
desk all all covered in plastic I of
course had to reposition all the stuff
that was over here over to there just
temporarily and then my big old cabinet
here I went to work on pretty quickly to
get those those focuses to get these
shaved off the the ends of the screws
that were sticking out actually only did
this side of it I didn't do the the far
side yet because I'm in a bit of a time
crunch and sorry I don't know why it's
taking so long to focus I'm in a bit of
a time crunch because I'm actually going
away for the weekend because it's my
lovely wife's birthday and we're doing a
weekend getaway and I really need to get
this done before then so the painting
first coat went on last night it's
pretty good it's actually pretty smooth
too although I think I'm gonna do a
second coat did all the spackling and
stuff as well
tried to smooth stuff over it's not 100%
smooth but it's much better than what
you might notice that I have a slightly
lighter shade of grey than before this
is called mountain Boulder that's the
shape that I chose out it's it's lighter
I wanted to brighten things up a little
bit I also wanted to get rid of there's
like a little bit of a green tint to the
old gray that was there that's the gray
that was just there when I moved in and
actually this matches pretty well with
the card that they gave me
an actual color that it turned out I
don't know if that's a rare thing with
paint or not but anyway I need to get
the shelves ready to go I need to do one
more coat of paint and the shells I'm
gonna run in to the store now though to
grab those shelves and have them ready
to install once the second coat is dry
put all these shelving options it's like
you could put shelves everywhere even in
your butt does it make sense I've
learned over the course of doing this
project that wood is expensive so all
these solid pieces over here that are
actually shelves are actually priced by
the foot it's like these like five six
five six seven dollars per foot and I
need eight-foot shelves so that means
those are 40 bucks each so in an attempt
to keep the cost down further down here
I discovered these guys which I've
already started picking out and these
are much more cost-effective because
they're in eight-foot sections and it's
only seven seventy one each let me put
two of these side-by-side to make about
a 12 inch deep shelf okay never mind I
found these one by tens that is wide
that single pieces much better
okay so here's pretty much where I met
first off cameras blurry I'm trying to
use out-of-focus I know it's like sit
here worrying it there you go all right
so I put the second coat of paint on and
I'm pretty happy with that like it's
kind of cleared up some some patches and
everything but if you haven't already
been able to tell this whole kind of
garage work blog today and yesterday has
been pretty rushed for instance I
haven't really painted underneath here
yet for example I only went down to the
back these are all connected to the wall
and I'm not gonna disconnect them to
paint so it makes a little bit more
difficult so I've only been doing this
top part here the goal is to get the
shelves in and that was to kind of
that's kind of my goal my endpoint for
this video but I am actually gonna have
to cut this short
I'm at a stopping point because it's
Thursday evening right now and I'm about
to leave for a weekend trip with my wife
it's it's may be your birthday maybe you
should say happy birthday to her on
Twitter
maybe she follow her on Twitter she's
mrs. Paul Hardware anyway um if you do
that tell her I said hi what this is
here is the brackets that's gonna hold
this shelf on of course it's
this way right here it should be but
yeah as you can see the the brackets
extend little bit further so the shelves
actually going to be held out from the
wall a little bit which is good I want
to be able to get stuff behind it maybe
for lighting and that kind of thing
these pieces of wood I got I'm super
happy with because they're very
cost-effective this is what delayed me
today and didn't get me as far as it was
what I where I wanted to get this
because these brackets that I got at
Home Depot which were also very cost
effective well these smaller ones were
like 350 these were like 450 you know so
the bigger ones I decided I've decided
to use and they're all white this was
basically they had a few different
colors in this but none of them the
black I figured maybe white will work I
decided no after getting it in here so I
just had to spray painted black so I was
doing that as you already saw and I've
gotten like half of them done but that's
another thing that needs finishing up is
at least one of these over here was was
not in the best shape in its path some
more work to do I've probably just want
to put another day into this so that'll
be coming this next week thank you guys
those so much for watching this
Paul's Hardware work log in the garage
garage work log video I really hope
you've enjoyed it I'm getting really
close to being kind of completed on this
stage of the the whole journey which I
really wanted to get done by the end of
this year and I'm pretty happy I'll be
able to do pretty happy with this new
color to let me know let me know in the
comments guys what you think of the new
color and how happy you're gonna be then
I'm actually gonna have some coverings

plugs are permanent these cords here
