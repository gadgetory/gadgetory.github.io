welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is very special because I have the
fractal define r6 it is one better than
to define r5 and it maintains their
pirate-themed which kind of confuses me
but anyway they also have some add-ons
and accessories that go with it so I
will be opening this mysterious package
as well as this mysterious package I'm
going to do a build in this system or in
this case today and I'll give you guys a
feedback review on the build process so
ease of building and also of course I
will go over the features for you since
I have done a lot of work with the
define r5 like in my epic water-cooled
system back there in the backgrounds I'm
going to be comparing it to that for the
most part but that's enough for an intro
let's get this thing out of the box
I got the white one Wow yeah that's it
yeah you should do you should zoom in on
that a little
all right first impression this is the
Maggio event version 3 I believe they've
been using mod you Benson the idea is
that the module pet pops off and you can
you can replace it with a mesh pet part
doesn't seem to be curing itself quite
oh okay I'll probably need to get
internal here and see if there's
something blocking it hey I gotta get
inside here so tempered glass side panel
all one piece of tempered glass and not
held on with any screws just supposed to
snap in there and pop off and again oh
oh oh yeah oh good job rectal all right
I like this basically they put a metal
frame inside the tempered glass so very
similar to the mod that I did not
exactly similar but you have the metal
frame that goes around the outside so it
sticks on a little bit more
traditionally there is a catch point
right here at the back that it will snap
this little nub right here into but oh
end at the bottom rather than that you
just got to kind of put that piece in
snaps on that's beautiful I love it and
then if you want to secure it I got a
couple thumb screws also gives you an
edge to hold it by so you don't get
fingerprints all over the tempered glass
opposite side panel very very similar in
construction sturdiness as well as feels
nice and quiet cuz you got a big rubber
pad there to do some sound dampening
yeah seems like they're sticking with
the traditional fractal builds quality
there as far as a nice thick steel and
little just just the tiniest bit of flex
not bad at all that's what it is
yeah all right now we need to correct
that I'm an idiot but come around to the
other side it's not the side to fill
through bed okay I figured out how the
the module event three works up here and
just to clarify the little piece popping
up was more probably just happened in
shipping there's a button back here
actually decently substantially sized
button and that's what wha actually
locks it into place so little tabs right
there slide in and then pushing the
button and it should pop down now it's
now it's staying now it's stand just
like it should and if I push the button
here pops up and we can remove it and
again metal on top and then I got some
plastic reinforcement going on just
underneath that and if you want to just
have the dust filtration you remove the
middle by an easy process that I haven't
figured out yet
ah-ha-ha-ha-ha good timing Joe had the
double check the manual just because I
didn't want to force anything here
without knowing what how it was supposed
to work but let's just start on this
edge and you can pop off metal piece
ever so gently there we go
now one thing I'm gonna say that I'm
already noticing with this piece is that
there is absolutely a very thin spot
right in the middle which has already
tried to bend on me a couple times so
it's not terrible by any stretch this is
just pretty much an aesthetic cover for
the top and it'll block some noise as
well because there is more sound
dampening on there just bear in mind
where these little cutouts right here
it's tried to bend they're on me a
couple times so especially when removing
it from this piece just try not to put
too much flex on that part of it
nice peel sexy peel
I found that very appealing
was that appeal of thunder
all right I've been able to give a quick
once-over of some of the features and
everything here so I think I'm ready to
share some of that with you I wanted to
start off with some of the stuff that
has kind of carried over from the
defined series leading up until now one
is that there's dust filtration
everywhere so other than the rear
exhaust which is an exhaust so typically
wouldn't need dust filtration so right
up here at the front there's a
full-length dust filter and the door by
the way is also reversible they're
maintaining that as well from the define
are five so there's latches on the other
side you can remove it
if you want it to open the other
direction and then right down here at
the bottom you can reach in and pull out
a full length filter and that covers the
entire bottom of the case so it's going
to keep dust from intake fans you might
have down here at the bottom there's
also a room for up to a two hundred and
eighty millimeter radiator down there up
at the bottom so if you put that if
you're setting this up for water cooling
you can do that as well also it's going
to cover your power supply intake fan
too so that is pretty nice
also inside the front door right here
there is another desk filter and this
one does also have some slats on it and
that is just to redirect some of the
noise so behind that you can see the
front fan mounts and it does come with
three fractal design 140 millimeter fans
there's double check in the manual I
realized that another part of this top
mod you vent cover once removed is that
there's a tray underneath it the tray
can also be removed and that will it's
right now it's got a couple screws that
are holding it in place but this of
course is modular up to 420 millimeter
radiators can fit up and top right there
and they put a little space right here
for a fill port that's something that I
modified and added on to my define r5 so
they're really really making this the
great equalizer here as briefly
distracted but the high end of that dust
filter you can see a couple of the
included fractal design fans they are
fractal design dynamic x2 GP 14 140
millimeter fans they pre-installed 2 as
intakes they're in the front and then
there's a third hundred forty millimeter
exhaust in the back also continuing from
the define r5 is the fact that you have
five in a quarter-inch Bay up here at
the top five and a quarter inch base you
know some cases have decided that those
just aren't a thing anymore but a lot of
people still use them for various things
reservoirs fan controllers there's this
plenty of good uses for a five and a
quarter inch base so nice to have that
at the top especially considering that
it's very flexible if you decide you
don't need it you can pretty much remove
the brackets that mount it up and
everything and still get access to all
that now when you're looking at this
case from the frontier just wanted to
point out the radiator support once
again you can do a 120 a 140 a 240 or
280 down at the bottom front on the
front on the front front you can do 120
140 to 40 to 80 or 360 and then across
the top you can do 120 140 to 40 to 80
360 are all the way up to 420 to 420
pretty nice now one of the features of
this case that I was most impressed with
when I first got it out of the box and
just started taking it apart was how
these side panels go on and basically
they're held on with a couple thumb
screws like your traditional side panels
and then beyond that they just pop off
it's got a little nubs at the top and
bottom at the back go into a couple
clasps here that is not the same
mounting mechanism as a define r5 but it
is similar and then again I really like
that they've gone with a metal frame
around this tempered glass piece to give
you something to hold on to and make it
a bit more substantial I have to imagine
it makes the tempered glass a little bit
stronger too maybe a little bit more
structural integrity I'm assuming that
so don't you know I could be wrong
what's I fell off though you might
notice that this is a little bit longer
from front to back than last time and
that is to help support the ability to
have either a bunch of drives up here in
the front or you can remove this panel
and more on that what I actually get see
removing that in order to allow you to
put either a bunch of drives in the
configuration that it's in right now and
you can maybe see back through there
some of the drive caddies that are
pre-installed or it can remove that
completely and just open this space up
to give you a little bit more room for
much thicker radiators or potentially a
water cooling reservoir or pump that
kind of thing now an added feature for
the define r6 is the vertical GPU mount
they've
right here so you got to PCIe slot
covers right there and this actually is
listed as a two and a half slot it can
fit up to two and a half slot graphics
cards bear in minds as was them
demonstrated by the me tree with some
recent testing on hardware connects when
you've got the vertically mounted GPU
here there's a potential for conflict
with air flow I'm not gonna be doing
temperature testing today but I highly
recommend check in that video out as he
does some testing with various cases but
it's good to know that they've listed it
as a two and a half slots gap here that
does potentially mean that there might
be a little bit more space between your
graphics card and the tempered glass to
allow a little bit more air in now you
will need a PCIe expansion cable ribbon
cable and they have sent me along one of
them this has been named the Flex VR c25
basically it's just a little ribbon
cable for PCI Express and it's got a
rigid mount there at the bottom and that
actually has a couple corresponding
mounting holes here on the power supply
shroud and then of course rest of it
would right up there and plug into your
motherboard it's actually got a nice bit
of sleeving here in the cable with a
fractal design logo too so that would
look pretty clean this is gonna cost you
forty dollars as an add-on upgrade item
which i think is reasonable for this
because buying a high-quality PCI
Express 6 extension cable like this will
cost you about 40 bucks anyway and it's
good to know that you can get one that
is automatically gonna be compatible and
will mount to your case and give you a
nice mounting point for your graphics
card and everything that should be
available in January of 2018 now when I
was doing the initial unboxing I already
kind of showed you guys this top module
event three-piece the plastic protective
dust filter there as well as the metal
piece that can go on top of it I like
that they've added this metal piece on
top I think it's a lot more classy than
a plastic piece covering up there so
will give you a nice enclosed feel if
you leave that on however you can of
course remove the metal that will give
you just the airflow through and then
there is a radiator bracket up here it's
just held on by a couple screws you can
pop that out to mount your radiator
outside of the case which is very
convenient and then again up to 420
millimeter rad support as well as a
pre-drilled out fill port which i think
is pretty nice too
as it's a top of the case is a good
place to put a fill porch all right
let's slip around here to the back and
pop the back panel off yes just like
that and this will give you guys a
better look at the business end so to
speak
first off let's quickly pop out one of
these little hard drive caddy trays
there you go an all-metal tray these
will support 2.5 inch or 3.5 inch drives
and it's got just a couple little prongs
that plug into the end down there and
then a single captive thumb screw to
actually secure it in place
it doesn't look like these have rubber
damped rubber mounts on the place where
the Caddy meets the drive cage but they
do still have little rubber grommets to
mount up your 3.5 inch drive to provide
a little bit of vibration dampening
there if if you do a 3.5 inch drive in
there also really nice that if you are
configuring a system with I would guess
air cooling and lots of drive support
there's just tons of these drives in
here so they've included six of these
drive trays but as you can probably see
there's one two three eleven it looks
like there's 11 actual Mouse so I'm not
sure if fractal is going to be selling
these drive trays individually but like
if you did a bunch of 2.5 inch SSDs in
there something like that there's a lot
of different configurations you can do
it's also nice as far as positioning
goes for 3.5 inch drives which can heat
up and what you often want to space out
from each other a bit to have them right
here right behind the front intake fans
and also again just the modular
positioning available so you can move
those around to best suit your needs
depending on where you have the other
hardware in the system those are not the
only drive mounts though there are two
more 2.5 inch drive mounts right here
and if you were to set this up in water
cooling mode where you remove that front
piece and all these trays that does
limit you on storage space but comes
with a couple of these and you can mount
them behind the motherboard tray as they
come pre-installed right there or if you
have some SSDs that you want to show off
there's actually a couple Mining points
right here on the power supply shroud as
well or so I am told and believe ya just
slide them in like that
and secure them down with the screw I
also want to point out that this has a
two-tone color scheme very similar to a
lot of fractals cases but this is
available in a variety of colors so I
have the black and white version as you
can see here very very distinct two-tone
black and whites with the black brushed
metal piece on the front versus the
pretty much white everywhere else except
for some black accents also available in
a gun metal finish and then also
available as a black with the white
accents that you might be a little bit
more familiar with from the define our 5
series or available in a black out
version that's all black with black
hardware as well so you can get the
blackest black fractal case that you
have ever wanted beyond that inside
you've got these grommets for routing
cable management and I kind of like the
hex design on those they also seem
pretty sturdy and like they're going to
stay in place
you got them at the top a couple on the
sides and then one down here at the back
which would be very useful for writing
cables up to a graphics card for example
and rounding out things here on the back
cable management area I do like that
fractal has continued to use a fair
amounts of pretty smartly physicians
tie-down points so you got a couple up
here at the top couple down here on the
right side and then of course you still
have the pre-installed velcro straps for
your main business of routing cables up
the center area right here and then an
add-on that we haven't seen before is
this little central fan hub right there
so this we get power via a SATA port and
then you can route this plug over to
your motherboard and that can allow you
to have PWM control you actually have
three PWM plugs here four PWM
controllable fans and then you have six
three pin fan connections for standard
three-pin fans I guess I've decided to
go with the open version of this I
really quickly wanted to show you guys
how to convert it it looks like it only
takes about six screws there's a couple
here at the top they do all appear to be
your standard Phillips head design
there's a couple more here on the front
and I did up to remove the front panel
just one there over here
and then on the bottom these are the
rails for the dust filter and a couple
gaps get to the two on the buck and then
it just Falls it just falls in yeah
but hey look we have now removed this
panel and now look how much room there
is so here's where you can see like
massive thick radiators push-pull
configurations lots of lots of room to
work with up there in the front now and
that's how we're gonna leave it for the
rest of the build here's a real quick
rundown of the parts I'm gonna be
installing guys this was supposed to be
an 8700 K I can't locate my 87 or K I'm
sure it's somewhere but it's an 80 400 K
for our intents and purposes for all
intents and purposes it's the same thing
gotta cool it with a cry rag h7 quad
Lumi haven't used that before got an
horas Z 370 horas Ultra gaming
motherboard this one I've used before
for some benchmark testing does fine job
I'm just going to stick with this
Toshiba TR 200 SSD that I used in the H
400 I build that I did recently as well
of course air Dominator platinum 32 gig
memory kit and then we've got an EVGA
geforce gtx 1070 TI which i have
neglected to use yet so i figured this
has a bit of bling enos on it and would
be a good option for that's vertical GPU
mount and finally for a power supply we
got the EVGA 650 GQ let's get started
click random shout-out for my favorite
my favorite tie-down points in this case
so far look at that above this is above
the IO shield slot right there and I'm
trying to just kind of tuck this cable
for the fan back up and around so it's
not visible look there's a little catch
right there
okay I'm not focused I need to find
manual focus on this didn't really show
accessories much but you get a little
practical YP cloth you get a little
little nut to tighten down your
motherboard standoffs always convenient
to have that and you have individually
packaged screws for mounting the various
things and a little collection that's it
taste so the basics that you would
expect but look extra thumb screws I
like that
let's do some closing notes and the
first thing I want to mention is
actually something I haven't mentioned
yet which is the front panel IO I am
happy that Fraxel has maintained two USB
three and two us two USB 2.0 ports
actually do like having a couple USB 2.0
ports up there so you can plug in stuff
that doesn't need a lot of bandwidth
like a mouse or a keyboard really quick
I think that's convenient however it is
lacking when it comes to the type C
connection especially if you want USB
3.1 gen2 that is one of the
modifications that I added on to the
define r5 I've got back there so I would
feel a little weird about it if my old
and modified define r5 had better
features in this one but if you're not
fractal does have a piece that you can
order from them again coming in q1 of
2018 basically replaces that entire
front panel unit up there it's gonna
cost you $30 so it's kind of like I'm
kind of on the fence about that it's 30
bucks to add USB type-c 3.1 gen2 which
is nice to have but it's 30 bucks I've
seen cables itself for like 15 bucks so
I don't know that's something that I do
feel should have just been included by
defaults now pricing on these cases is a
hundred and thirty bucks if you're gonna
get the non tempered glass version and
150 bucks for the tempered glass version
so I do feel like the pricing is pretty
fair for the case itself but I wish that
type-c connector was included just for
the default based price although it is
nice it you can upgrade to it and I
guess for folks who don't have that
connector on their motherboard you do
still have the option to go without it I
guess now the flat PC a ribbon cable I
do feel like was a good choice to make
an add-on piece because not everyone is
going to want to position their graphics
card right here again it's very much a
visual thing it might impact the cooling
performance of your graphics card I
haven't tested that directly in this
case so I don't want to say that
outright right now but again I'll link
to the harbor Canucks video where they
did some more testing on that it might
potentially depending on where you mount
amount stuff in and the front here
conflict with one of those SSD mounting
points you can fit an SSD in the second
mounting point right there so there's
some back-and-forth there
then you are definitely blocking most of
your PCI Express expansion slots so you
know it's it's really one of those form
over function things or vice versa
depending on Honeywell set it up but of
course if you don't want to do that just
don't buy the ribbon cable install your
graphics card normally but I will say at
least visually it looks pretty nice
having it right here and that pretty
much sums up my first impression of the
Defiant r6 here I do want to mention
also that it supports the ATX
motherboards so you can't fit a wider
size but their board in there as well
it might block a little bit of the
pass-through grommets for your cable
management's but you know it does
support that I want to point out that
there's a lot of blank space up here in
the front right now so this is a larger
case that's made for install
installation of more hardware if you
compare it for example to the fractal
mesh if I see that case I could fit this
exact same layout of hardware in and
it's so good you know six inches shorter
I feel like so saves a little bit more
space on your desk however for people
who are looking to build a system that
has a lot of storage or assistant has a
lot of expansion and a lot of area for
adding water cooling components I think
fractal has done a great job as far as
the layouts I like all the radiator
support going on everywhere and the only
thing I think that we might have to come
back to is maybe a second opinion on
that all-black front panel piece right
there
and then also that is completely
covering completely blocking the front
intake so you do only have the intake
via the side vents right here and a
little bit at the bottom now I have not
tested that directly so we'll have to
come back to that in the future but time
will tell if that's actually causing any
detriment to the front intake and air
flow on the case now I happen to know
that there are probably a few other
youtubers out there who also have made
videos on the define r6 so I think I'm
gonna hunt some of them down because I
believe they might have had the other
colors if you guys want to check out the
gray or the black or the black with
white accents so if I find some
reputable youtubers I'll post links to
their videos down in the comments all in
all I think fractal did a really good
job with this case I do think it's a
little bit more expensive than it was
the last time around but they've added
value when it comes to the expandability
there's also flexibility making this a
very suitable home for a workstation for
a gaming PC for
or a combination PC editing lots of
storage or for an all-out water-cooled
build as well but guys that's gonna wrap
it up for this video definitely hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
I'll post links to this as soon as I can
find it available for sale down in the
description below thanks again and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
