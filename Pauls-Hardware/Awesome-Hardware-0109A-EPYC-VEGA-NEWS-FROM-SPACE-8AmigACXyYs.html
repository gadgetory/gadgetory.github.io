streaming we're live we are hi everyone
both okay yeah - both yes we're
streaming live to twitch for streaming
live to YouTube thanks for being here
this is awesome hardware it's the live
show about technology and computers and
that kind of thing we do it every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time it's true we scream - twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware for stream to my
channel Paul's hardware and then on the
second half of the show which will start
in about a half an hour will stream to
Cal's channel bit wits if you're
watching live thanks for being here with
us we drink some beer occasionally we
say a swear word so sorry if we do that
and yeah we're generally we're generally
we generally have a vague idea of what
we're talking about when it comes to
that technology so I think we have a
good show plan for today I might have
the show we're going to talk about some
AMD news both from the Vega side of
things as well as epic because AMD did
have an epic event today for epic it was
epic I didn't see it you didn't I
FLE missed it you only could have seen
it if you were there in person I wasn't
relying like that there's a server event
so yeah on Cal's half the show we'll
talk a little bit more about the recent
X 299 launch just happen yesterday as
well as other interesting things yeah
okay I will also do a pimp my PC so
thanks for being here guys
and and cheers cheers Cheers all y'all
cheers - okay needing more beer already
at the start of the show also quick
shout out at the top of the show to sell
our moderator who is in chat so
processing if you're watching the show
live and you happen to purchase
something we'll give you a shout out at
the end of the show if you want to
purchase something check out our stores
- false hardware net have some shirts
and mugs pint glasses polo shirts all
very high-quality stuff and it will be
shipped straight to you ships
internationally Kyle also has a store
bit wit tech slash store is where you
can find his merch so buy some of that
stuff if you happen to buy from both of
our stores and we shipped together in
the same package and you'll get a
shipping refund and right now our guy
who does all the stuff John who's
awesome hi John
watching he's working on a different
configuration for the shipping to reduce
the price a little bit more just
shipping Koster if he's gonna make all
of our merchandise free what that's what
he's doing that's these may be doing
that on your half of the store all of
our stuff no yours - he told me he's
like everything's gonna be free we
shouldn't give it away
good all right uh let's let's dive into
cool down right into it five minutes or
so into the into the start of the show I
was a very efficient true it was well
done today I get anything I feel like we
usually say something else but uh we
didn't say what kind of beer we were
drinking Oh
what beer we joined I'm drinking a fat
tire I'm drinking red velvet these are
left over from last week yep and then
we've got more more different beers on
the way actually I feel like yeah it's
me - I'll be ready for that soon you're
saying once Paul finishes his beer he
stops drinking like a once the slower
one of us like it's done finishing their
stupid bee that sounds like a chat a
challenge on trial yeah it is Paul who
drink this beer accept it accept the
challenge
ha little did you know I poisoned it you
only have 30 seconds to live say your
last words now is this for the ritual
that happens every year yes the summer
solstice yes the summer solstice which
just so happens to coincide with the
109th episode of awesome hardware God
every on every 109th episode this will
bring about the coming of the there must
be a sacrifice of the revolution of the
PCI Express Lanes
I don't know I'm dying I'm trying to tie
things in with the show that's the idea
all right
first first it's all come full circle
yeah put that statement all right a tech
of the day after tomorrow this is all
technology that's not available yet but
will be available soon I feel like our
first contestants which is AMD Vega
should be available by now what it's not
it keeps seemingly being delayed but
we're still expecting it by the end of
this month or maybe the beginning of
next month or maybe a little bit later
than that but according to this rumor
what's your rate originated on Hardware
battle comm which is a Chinese website
that they might be available from these
are the actual consumer GPUs by the way
by late July or early August so not
quite the first half that we were
originally promised from AMD but a lot
to let that slide according to the
article the reason for this is due to
the difficulty with manufacturing HBM 2
which is the memory that Vega uses that
seems like a reasonable explanation but
if this is true what they say and be
actually shipping boards to add in board
partners so that the third-party
manufacturers who make the actual GPU
graphics cards that aimed for the GPUs
that AM D Radeon makes em there's to
Vega GPUs the venket NXT that's 64
compute units 4096 stream processors and
16 gigs of HP m2 memory then there's the
Vega 10 Pro which is cut down a little
bit 56 compute units 3584 stream
processors 8 gigs of HBM 2 so half the
HBM so do we know yet if Vega 10 XT is
is the one that's going to compete with
like the 1080i or the GTX 10 that's all
that's all rumor and speculation at this
point what the hell's going on
alright stupid alarm to Christmas I hear
bells ringing um it's all rumor and
speculation at this point there's been
big stuff that's popped out here and
there good stuff
Vega ass you just keep it up you dug it
slip anything past you can i nope that
was completely unintentional but yeah
there's there's there's like the
speculation has been that it's it's
between a 1070 and attend a area like
between a 1070 and a 1080 or between a
1018 and 1080 Ti
but time has been like passing you know
and and it kind of sucks it it's not out
yet yeah so if HP m2 really is the issue
here then I'm hopefully they'll be able
to produce enough and of course the the
the enterprise variants that are made
for GPU compute stuff those just
launched but they are very expensive
they're $1200 and up and those are
featuring HP m2 right yeah those are but
those are based on the same GPUs the
same architecture they're just designed
for for use in the workstation which
means they're useless to us yeah I mean
in the past that's typically how that
works with workstation cards they don't
really function very much for actually
playing video games in a gaming system
the article also said that non-reference
designs will be allowed shortly after
launch so hopefully that's at least
something that we can look forward to if
there is a delay and they're originally
intended launch then maybe that does
give the third party at it third partner
adding board manufacturers time to
design specialty GPU designs custom PCB
solutions although won't matter
they don't matter they're only like 20
units available worldwide yes as of
shitty HBM 2 yields yeah
or because of a theory of mining
actually I don't think I read I don't
think either of us have this on our list
today we talked about this a little bit
last week but um hell we'll do a brief
segue into that aetherium mining
cryptocurrency mining in theory M is the
big one right now but there's a couple
others that have also been kind of going
off recently these are the ones that are
kind of ASIC proof like the Asics that
have been designed that kind of took the
wind out of the sails for mining for
Bitcoin with something like a GPU these
other crypto currencies you can't use
those ASIC solutions to mined them so
it's gone back to GPUs being useful AMD
cards are sold out everywhere like you
basically you can't find them or they're
marked up a hundred bucks or more Nvidia
cards are now also starting to be sold
out everywhere and there was an article
I think it was a tech powerup article or
a piece or a PC gamer article earlier
today saying that basically like right
now if you look for a gtx 1070 which is
supposed to be about 380 bucks retail
can't find anything for less than about
$450 yeah it's crazy what's no one
should buy it forward because apparently
this hasn't quite crept up to hitting
the ten eighties yet they can still get
a 10 84 500 to 550 but anything in that
range or lower
is just sold out a ridiculously
overpriced so so why doesn't why haven't
the prices for GTX 1080s gone up it's
just that it's more efficient to buy the
the to get more of the lesser cards and
wire them all up together so the 1080 is
apparently haven't been hit and you know
the Nvidia mining isn't as efficient as
the AMD mining as it has been on AMD
GPUs as well which is why it took some
time but apparently it is still
profitable enough there's such a bubble
right now with the value of this
currency that it's affecting Nvidia
cards as well so the theorem is just is
that just like a Bitcoin alternative
it's just a different cryptocurrency yes
and there's there's some technical
background to it that I don't know
enough about to speak on but is it worth
more than Bitcoin right now no I think
last I saw was like 400 just look you
theory impress right now just google it
we can put we can find it out but it
really sucks for anyone who wants to buy
build a gaming PC like literally is it
is impossible to build a budget gaming
PC right now because the prices of the
GPUs are so ridiculously inflated 391
351 ok so I think that my ex that goes
400 bucks last week but it goes up and
down oh yeah so it did it did peak at
about 400 and it's dipped a bit because
I think this has gained so much
popularity there's a ton of people
actually doing the mining right now but
anyway brief segue there it really sucks
if you're looking for a GPU right now
especially if you're looking for
anything that cost less than $500 and
brutal yeah I took an uber into downtown
LA not too long ago in our uber driver
who's super nice handed me like a card
at the end of it he's like hey if you
want to ever want to get involved
because I was telling it on like sort of
into tech and whatnot and he was a part
of like a Bitcoin mining group ah I got
like a global worldwide search for
mining group and he handed me his card
and I was like whoa well I didn't even
well thank you I might look into this
cuz uh I definitely know I can't afford
the electric bill at home but if I was
part of a group who would do it all for
me I honestly don't know how it works
like as far as like if you're a part of
a big big group like who does the mining
it I think I don't know I don't know how
it works there as far as what effort is
put in or you know because I mean it's
pretty easy to quantify how much
work has been put in by like your bank
of computers that you have mining or
something like that yeah I'm not sure
how it works with the groups or that
kind of thing I wish I had solar I don't
have solar right now I've been looking
into solar options if I had solar right
now I would be mining at home absolutely
yeah
because I have I have a couple five 80s
I have one or two five 70s
I mean I've better things get cards yeah
I have quite a few graphics cards at
home but like in California it's
basically like the money I made from
mining would pay for my electrical bill
and it would even out and I'd just be
wasting collection if what if we what if
we mined at your house and I contributed
like half of your electric bill and we
split the profits it doesn't matter the
more the more GPUs we mined with the
more the electricity will bill will go
up and eventually we'll also hit it
there's got to be a way Paul it has got
to be a way to make this work I can't do
YouTube forever eventually we'll also
hit a cutoff where like my just the the
power like my main my main electrical
box won't have enough like won't be able
to feed Edison will be over every other
ways running out of it yeah how are you
doing over here ah your box we're
switching to Elspeth speed waves out
right now by the way which is an
absolutely amazing stouts one of my
favorite beers of all time it's a little
bit seconded out but it's worth it it's
12% so I like those drips this is like
for Bud Lights right here um and it's a
fantastic beer that I just recently
discovered that it comes in pints before
the only other size i've team didn't is
like a big ass like the wood i drank on
teaching my wife to how to build the pc
while drunk yeah I drank one whole
bottle of those and it was like a fifth
now this is awesome that was the only
capacity I ever founded it comes in
Heights
it comes in pints I just I'm getting one
super-dangerous okay
cheers Cheers
I like how we're drinking out of each
other's glasses yeah it must be nice to
be able to pull your entire your entire
beer yep
hey hey you what you guy your
new ones are bigger yeah you're right
they are bigger bigger than yours no the
same size we should compare we can do we
can criticize her glasses side by side
all right next up Volta since we talked
a little bit about AMD having issues
getting Vega onto the market due to HP
m2 yields NVIDIA has actually had
high-end graphics cards available for
the past I don't know I want to say
cycle I'll leave it at that vague term
and this article from Guru of 3d
suggests that is because NVIDIA has not
put set their sights on HBM to which AMD
kind of has they've said ever since Fiji
like our hand cards have HBM memory
which you know is cool and everything
but also if you go for the past you know
year or so AMD has had no answer to it
to Nvidia when it comes to their
high-end GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti graphics
cards they just don't really compete up
in that area so when it comes to the
next generation for NVIDIA those are
going to be based on GPU architecture
codenamed Volta and it's supposedly
again this is a rumor this is future
news that they're going to have a gddr5
X option for that in fact according to
this article
most of the GPUs in this lineup will be
based on either either gddr5 X or GD d r
6 this articles from guru 3d but the
source is from Fudd's illa based on what
they call well-informed sources which is
you know most legit we trust them we
totally trust them there's a small chart
here which I'll try to make wait where
did it go what if it won't let me do oh
it's just what if by well before me
sources they're talking about WCC of
tech I don't know the chart is convinced
I hope not the chart is comparing gddr5
5x the GVR 6 so it doesn't matter that
much anyway Nvidia we'll be using HP m2
with the GV 100 GPU which according to
their code names would be GeForce Volta
100 which is usually the largest ship
when it comes to what's available but
that's probably just like this
generation with Pascal going to be
limited to their highest end cards in
the enterprise range with their tests
list I mean with their time not Tesla
Quadro they're Quadros oh so yeah
there's that GD r6 is coming in 2018
though so that should be the new hotness
hopefully another option as well
compared to HBM since it seems like it's
really hard to produce HBM to memory
that just just seems to be the situation
right now okay let's talk about epic
let's have an epic discussion about epic
so many puns his article from PC
perspective there's several good
articles out there I was also following
along a little bit earlier today with
the non tech as a doctor cut hrus doing
a bit of live blogging of this events
but AMD is having an event for epic it's
went on today and there was a
presentation and this is server stuff so
perhaps not quite as interesting to you
if you were more of a PC enthusiast in
the at-home space however this has sort
of echoes that reverberate and effect
thread Ripper because thread Ripper is
kind of based on the same stuff that
this is all based on so AMD is trying to
get back into the server space they
basically aren't there at all over the
past six years their share there has
deteriorated deteriorated they used to
have like a 20 percent 20 to 25 percent
share in the server space back when they
had their Opteron lineup for for servers
but yeah you guys all probably know the
story over the past six seven years for
AMD but they're back now what their Zen
architecture they've implemented it on
the desktop side with Rison now they're
implementing it with a server side
solution this is code is called epic
they're actually going for sale today
and Amy had a bunch of representatives
from a bunch of high ends like
well-known
companies that were there at the event
with them that do enterprise stuff like
I remember any of them though it's that
means they're not important I'm just I'm
basically having a brain fart right now
I was gonna I was gonna rattle off a
couple live who's there
you all know had examples I hear you
know who you are
Visual Studio VMware KB Citrix these are
operating systems what I'm talkin about
industry step 2 super micros these are
these are hardware partners never mind
who cares let's just talk about the
hardware I'll stick to that I don't have
a slide for that epic 7,000 epic I like
how much fun they're having with their
branding right the red ripper epic
through they're getting yeah they're
having uh they're having a good time I
think you got it you got a sell it right
you guys diversify sit up it's a
processor
alright so epic is going to have up to
32 cores and 64 threads per CPU and this
is a server platform which means you can
have either one or two sockets and
there's different configurations for
that which I'll go into in just a moment
eight ddr4 memory channels up to eight
ddr4 memory channels each individual
CPUs quad channel up to two terabytes of
memory capacity per CPU which means four
terabytes and in two months slots
configurations and 128 freakin PCI
Express Lanes under that KB like X 28
take that Xeon I mean this is the xeon
competitor remember that i know so uh
one I mean KB like x2 sure why not but
but yeah so here's here's the chart I'm
gonna open this cuz what's the max you
can get on Xeon right now half core core
counts 22 or 24 or PCIe lanes PC a lens
I'm not sure but and I think it might be
64 so here's the entire product stack
and you can see there's on the left it
goes from the the lowest end on the
bottom which is an 8 core 16 thread part
all the way up to the epic 75 hundred
and seventy 600 series at the top which
are 32 32 cores 64 thread
hmm look at that the top-end chip to
70601 it boosts up to 3.2 gigahertz on
32 cores I don't know how many cores
it'll do that on same time it has a
hundred and eighty watt TDP which is I
don't know that's insane so you need a
liquid-cooled server build for epic I'm
saying 180 watts for that many cores is
very very low oh and you would I mean
I'm sure they'll be crazy people who do
liquid-cooled servers or something like
that with this sort of thing but usually
an enterprise space liquid cooling is
the last thing you would ever wanted to
right especially since even these are
all locked right they're not gonna yeah
these are there's no overclocking or
anything like that these are these are
server chips
there's immediately available immediate
availability I should say for the top
five CPUs in the stacks of the 32 core
and the 24 threat core ones and then
there will be a upcoming it says by the
end of July do before the end of July
for these lower ones so if you notice
the lower ones here the eight core and
sixteen core ones and 16 cores and 32
threads is what dread Ripper is supposed
to have mm-hmm but this is supposed to
be available at the end of July epic
epic is there not the rest of these the
top ones here are already available
again probably not exactly going to be
launched at the same time since their
server parts and consumer parts but
again thread Ripper is probably is
basically derived from this now just to
go over real quickly some of the more
and specifics for how they've configured
stuff in here because how do you get
from eight cores like we have with a
risin 1800 X or something like that up
to 32 cores these are actually multi die
CPUs so let me go to the next age dual
die yeah so
so each CPU as you can see on this in
this picture here has for actual dyes on
it so each of these dives would be
roughly equivalent not the same exact
thing but a rough equivalent to an
eight-core 16 thread rise and die so 8
16 24 32 and I'm doing it I'm doing
addition here so all them together on a
fully enabled chip that's what you get
and then they have different layers of
Infinity fabrics because they're using
the term infinity fabric to refer to not
just link between the different CCX
units within each each die but also the
link between each CP each die on the CPU
on something like a multi thread ripper
or epic CPU and that's how they connect
together and the Infinity fabric links
between the cores offer 42 gigabytes per
second of buy Direction aband width at
extremely low low power ryan Shrout who
wrote the article on this on pc
perspective and there's a lot more
detail on the article which is linked in
the description if you guys want to
check it out one of his big concerns
about this platform is latency and
latency between the different quarters
but they've developed us in such a way
that there's either only a single step
or present as many as two steps and a
two CPU configuration between going from
one core to the other so each epoch CPU
I'm using the wrong mouse each epoch CPU
and also not on their own story ah ok
get with it each epic CPU has eight PCI
Express by sixteen links so 8 times 16
that's what gives you 128 total lanes of
PCI Express bandwidth but it's
interesting how they're configured now
when I say there's multiple dies per
package I don't have an image up here so
you can see so when you say there's
multiple dies per package they need to
be able to communicate with each other
when they're put in a two CPU
configuration so each die has two of the
PCI Express by 16 links so basically 32
PCIe lanes per die
with splitter the two with 8/8 each so
that's why when you have a single one of
these CPUs four of these dies each with
each with 16 get the words out
damn it it's quite confused so I wrote
this all down each with H PCIe by 16
lengths that links splits to per die
gives you hundred twenty eight I'm
really doing a poor job of explaining
this that's okay if I had it with that
right so 1 2 3 4 2 4 6 and 8 8 times 16
gives you hundred 28 right so you'd
think if you put two of these CPUs
together you should have 128 plus 128
you should have 256 PCI Express 3.0
lanes and that's not how it works
but it's kind of cool how it works
because when you plug in 2 to the same
one since each die has 2 by 8 PCI
Express connections one of those by 8
PCI Express connections connects
directly to the other chip hmm so that's
why when you put two of these together
you still have 128 PCI Express 3.0 lanes
I see I hope that makes sense to you
guys I've kind of figured out reading
the article again read the article if it
doesn't make sense wrench Ryan does a
better job of explaining tonita
what than I do but again that's not
necessarily that they pull their PC
aliens but one chip one die shares its
lanes or bridges its lanes to it to
another all four dies all four dies yeah
because each die has has 2 by 8
connections yeah no HD each guy has 2 by
16 connections 16 is 2 by 16 okay yes 32
times 4 okay so yeah 8 total per CPU
yeah
two per die right and each one of those
has 16 PGA lanes right so when you
connect two of them together for each
die one of them is still available as a
connection for your 16 PCIe lanes one of
them directly connects to the other CPU
and that's how they talk back and forth
and because view becomes the infinity
fabric link between them I see which
incidentally has 32 gigabytes per second
of bandwidth
means you get the total of 256 gigabytes
per second of bandwidth a pcie 3.0
bandwidth per socket that sounds like a
lot yeah it's it's a flood let's lots of
connectivity so um again you know no one
I think here is trying to say an AMD
wasn't trying to say anything that they
suddenly have in instructions per clock
lead over Intel but according to the
pricing that they're talking about with
this stuff they're pretty much
decimating the Xeon lineups that the
intel has going on right now when it
comes to price to theoretical
performance again that's theoretical
because these are launching today and
I'm sure there'll be more tests on it
and everything
however again the article has some of
the benchmarks they were showing which
we're all pretty impressive especially
if you follow enterprise stuff which I
do only vaguely which is why I'm not
going into more detail here um there it
is check it out epic seems pretty badass
hopefully Ripper is going to launch
right around the same time then yeah
right yeah so um cool to hear more stuff
about epic again because it trickles
down to thread Ripper and it's also cool
to see AMD coming back into it with
another potential way to claw their way
back into a market that they haven't
been a part of for quite some time
because that helps them as a company as
a whole and theoretically then that
might help them continue to be a good
competitor to Intel cuz see what that's
has done just in the past six months if
not the past one month I guess yeah
alright let's move on to the next
segment next segment is going to be
tales from space Tarot's from space as
myspace music intro that is good like
though we get a soundboard or or haunted
house sound is it always kind of
synonymous yeah and go either way oh
that works at NASA right they they do
space stuff they have found 10 new rocky
earth-like planets whoa rocky
um rocky rocky meaning they're like
rocky road but kind of difficult yes
difficult to navigate uh come sketchy
yeah I was singing rocky like Rocky
Balboa for some reason that makes less
I'm gonna play this video I've no idea
what this Valda named Rock usual yeah we
named it we named the first planet rocky
one is and I mean named the second
planet rocky to the fifth planet was
destroyed by the Russians for some
reason and yeah
goddamn her okay we don't we don't need
to show this they discovered planets
there's quite a few of them actually 219
suspected planets because that's what
the Kepler space telescope telescope
does it looks and finds suspect
potential exoplanets planets outside of
our solar system and then scientists are
able to go and focus other telescopes on
those and actually verify and discover
whether or not they're actually there of
the 219 new suspected planets there's
ten that they say are rocky and in the
Goldilocks zone Goldilocks zone being
the space from whatever particular star
you're talking about where it's not too
hot and it's not too cold it's just
right just right so that liquid water
can form and then that distance varies
depending on the the size and and heat
output of the star what are they done by
rocky when they say rocky is that snarky
rocky means like it's not a gas plant
cuz like you know we got we got our
Jupiter you know and our Saturn out
there out there sucking up asteroids
keeping them from from coming in here
and destroying those those would be you
know there's lots of those out in the
universe but are in the galaxy even but
we can't exactly land on them and then
build a colony or something like that so
rocky meaning there's a much higher
chance that there's there's land there
potentially an atmosphere eyesential
e-even liquid water potentially life yes
exactly
if you're honoring the total number of
suspected exoplanets that's found by
Kepler so far is now over four thousand
four thousand thirty four total
suspected exoplanets and two thousand
three hundred thirty five of those have
been verified
five thousand short is that if five
thousand short of being over nine
thousand yep getting there
in their next step NetSuite about this
earlier this week I see the word probe
probe - NASA wads to probe Uranus in
search and search of gas got a lot of
retweets on this one for some reason
can't figure out why the article starts
NASA is currently spitballing
submissions that will give them that
will give us the best look at Uranus
that we've ever gotten pretty exciting
I'll hold you to that
yeah these are theoretical missions that
they're being discussed
these are NASA spacecraft that would be
sent not just to Uranus but also to
Neptune so you thought I was going to
continue with the puns but I'm actually
talking about space okay
the missions would go there to determine
what the planets are made of or
determine more specifically we have a
vague idea based on no spectrometry and
stuff flights but that's not - I'm not
I'm not going to trauma tree and that
sounds like a fancy word thing where you
look at the colors and you can see the
colors and tell what's there I'm not
good at science rainbow the the visit
the light color blue I can't even I
can't even go into this right now
because I need to look at it and I don't
I hate talking about things that I don't
have like full grasp of so let's move on
okay
this would include both flybys as well
as an orbiter so the orbiter would be
sent in the orbiter would send an
atmospheric probe to Uranus to sample
its gases and detect elements sounds
invasive so yes the probe Uranus and we
would all benefit it's really wet come
to dinner anus being probe the timeline
for the Uranus trip just so you guys can
be prepared is 2030 through 2036
hopefully they'll narrow that down at
some points the Neptune mission that's
discussed would need to take place
before 2030 or after 2040 so it's either
like we're going to see it when we're in
our prime like right now like we will
continue to be four clearly quite a few
years or after 2040 will be old
decrepit but hopefully by then there'll
be some sort of technology that makes us
young what about as far as timeline like
how long will the probe be in Uranus
will the probe I mean I'm sure it
depends on how easily the gas attainable
the gases yeah but I imagine there is a
time limit there there's only so much
time that can be spent in Uranus Azir is
it possible to make Uranus expel gas
more quickly or I'm kind of subject to
just I mean I'm I'm sure that'd be
possible but as scientists I feel like
that's something that they'd want to
avoid you know they want Uranus to be
explored naturally and comfortably
without any messing about let's say you
don't want that kind of thing going on
with Uranus that's true what if your
anus has diarrhea
you should stop you should really stop
just what if clarify what happens if a
little bit more than gas comes out while
we're probing Uranus
well it's missing a possible that
mysterious that Uranus might shoot out a
little bit more than just gas and we
might all be in way in over our heads
that's totally possible okay you know
that's the nature of space well as we
know the risks involved should always be
aware of that yeah okay here's this one
I'm going to try to burn through quickly
because there's lots of notes and it's a
little crazy oh by the way I need to
finish that Neptune mission I was
talking about the reason it needs to be
before 2030 or after 2040 is due to the
timing of the gravity assisted boost
that they would need to get around to
Jupiter which we've all seen in the
movies it's like you're glad
dude gravity slingshot and then but it's
very beautiful not constant how it
usually is and all right as Gardea the
world's first space nation do you want
to become a citizen Kyle in where should
a citizen as Gardea I'll pick my mates I
support any place that that guards my
ass that's a good idea
we're continuing the puns oh yeah for
that last story as Gardea is named after
a Norse myth Norse mythological city in
the skies it is basically
a space nation that is open for to be
joined by all the residents of Earth it
costs nothing to join so let's scroll
down to this dude right here cost
nothing to join this is Russian
scientists dr. Igor Asher Bailey Asher
Asher Bailey
Asher Bailey dr. yes he originally
announced these plans to form the
world's first independent nation in
space in October of 2016
they were deluged with people signing up
they had a hundred thousand people in 40
hours they had five hundred thousand
three weeks and then they were like hey
we should add some like actual
verification that these are actually
people then they did that now it's a
211,000 decision it's a space nation
right it's and yes it's face nations
like the movie Elysium is Matt Damon
where there's just a big ass like ship
floating in space it's a whole
civilization that lives in space earth
is all and we screwed it up and
yeah those are the ramifications where
you get in discussion exercising here
but first let's clarify some of the
details of Asgardian because I'm sure
there's lots of people who are watching
who might want to join and like I said
anyone can join and it's free so if you
want to get into space this is probably
something associated with that ah all
right
their mission is to base it is to
provide a peaceful society to offer
easier access to space technology to
protect Earth from space threats and to
end to protect Earth from space threats
such as asteroids and man-made debris
how does it okay go ahead why are you
cutting me off I thought you're at a
stopping point took my to do that one
more time my window Eve and I'm going to
go live in as Gardea in space okay so
for what I asked you
all right I may have second thoughts
about that though because so far the
signups are 83% male and 16% female oh
that doesn't add up to 100 the rest said
other Asgardian axis will establish a
physical presence in space so it's not
just a pipe dream via a series of
satellites the first of which the
Asgardian one will be launched into
orbit around Earth on September 12th
2017 this is that this is actually
actually going to happen it's going to
travel via orbital ATK's mission to the
International Space Station and will be
released from American aerospace or from
the aerospace firms ship once it docks
with the International Space Station
this is an not a full-sized satellite
it's a nano set nano satellites it's
about the size of a loaf of bread it
weighs six pounds holds 300 kilobytes of
data per person so the first hundred
thousand people who signed up for to be
citizens of as Gardea are able to upload
their data they basically have 300
kilobytes of data per person and they
can put stuff like pictures and that
kind of thing so short term I guess idea
here is now you have something in space
and if you know the world it has
thermonuclear war or something at least
your pictures are still in space so you
can still access them on Pinterest or
whatever I don't think it's internet
accessible but 300 kilobytes of data per
person for the first hundred thousand
citizens 202 kilobytes for the next
400,000 people and then 100 kilobytes
for the next people leading up to a
million citizens I don't know if they're
still going to have citizens after a
million but theoretically again they're
going to be launching more these
satellites family photos whatever
personal stuff is what you can do there
now what they're playing I do love doing
long-term is actually making habitable
oh that's I think that's the nano
satellite right thing they're planning
on actually making habitable platforms
in and in near-earth low-earth orbit yes
I don't know if this is one of them
maybe it is
and more pictures up here of space
platforms sure sure there is let's we'll
stick with this one anyway
they're going to establish I'm sorry
they're they're going to create
habitable platforms in low-earth orbit
that's the first hundred to 200 miles or
161 to 300 110 kilometers from space
that's where the ISS is located right
now so they have plans to actually start
making platforms so people can actually
move up to space is the general idea
here this Russian dude
Asher Bailey is a 53 year old rockin set
rocket scientist he's supposedly a
billionaire although because of what he
has done through his dealings and Russia
it's not exactly evident like I don't
think it's a it's known how much money
he has or whatever but it says he's
single-handedly bankrolling this project
which was which is kind of crazy um so
yeah I just I guess I just thought you
guys should know about this when it
comes to tales from space they want to
become a legitimate country they're
going to apply for UN recognition as a
nation in 2018 the state has to have a
permanent population a defined territory
a government I think and the capacity
enter in relations with other states so
I think it actually does have to have
you know they're going to need to get
some of their platforms up and running
but yeah that's pretty crazy
then we'll form a democratic government
in the next six months in the court
Prosecutor's Office National Audit
Office and other government bodies they
might have dual citizenship options
anyway again the articles linked in the
description if you guys want to read a
little bit more on that let's move on
though sweet tag for sorry fight all
right what are we arguing okay a brief
discussion about X 299 since it just
launched and
let's let's check out this article from
exes which is that motherboard
manufacturers would like you to buy
their motherboards and therefore they
have tantalizing offers for you oh yes
tantalizing offers super
tantalizing so for instance asus and
this promo is for the EU by the way
since we do have an international
audience
well exes is actually you know your UK
yeah UK or whatever but anyway asus
promotion in the EU you get a game you
get two games what do you get say that
uh a range of triple-a titles your
choice down there it's a big list yeah
there's one that you get like by default
though Oh that'd a to do aims planet oh
you get Donna for three Donna for so you
get Donna for three and then you get to
choose one of these triple-a titles
shadow for vampire
total war Warhammer to Assassin's Creed
origins Far Cry 5 group for elects agent
of mayhem Kingdom Come deliverance pray
the surge project Curtis us-led edition
a standard edition what an unfortunate
acronym yeah sexual sexually transmitted
diseases
Morrowind Tekken 7 or spell for three so
by an Asus board get couple free games
MSI a new I have an offer this is for
the US side if you get an MSI
motherboard you get a Corsair hydro
series h75 liquid cooler for free
that's a $75 value heyo gigabyte has the
experience pack cuz everything's x-rated
at gigabytes that's their new code sexy
new the experience pack is a bundle that
you get with the Auris motherboards that
are for sale
qualifying bother buyers will receive a
Norris hoodie a one-year subscription to
xsplit gamecaster
LEDs from cable mod a limited launch
edition keyboard mouse pad and a pair of
sennheiser CX 3.0 0
ear headphones the accessories are
chosen to highlight the motherboards
features so what we're going to ask
people in chat answer we're gonna argue
about here this is a little bit
different than a typical I feel like a
typical sword fight here because there's
multiple options so what what would get
you guys so if you guys have been
skeptical about X 299 which of these
things is the thing where you're like
hey I wasn't into it before but now I am
we have the three options from the three
motherboard manufacturers that we just
discussed we have this option down here
which is that you know I was getting it
no matter what doesn't matter or for
those haters out there that I want that
I will never touch your do it this is no
that's no basically at the bottom yeah
I'm never gonna do that so what do you
think how what should these these do you
think you can do well can I would go
with the obvious choice Paul which is I
would only build an X to 99 system if I
also get a hoodie and xsplit broadcaster
subscription LEDs and mouse pad and some
headphones I see because that is the
that's the whole complete package
alright that's that's definitely a nice
value add there all right so expert
subscription we're using exploit me
that's true to host this stream that's
true
hey I had to pay money for those in
broadcaster the subscriptions for
gamecaster that's okay they'll go on but
hey you know what I ice-cream game
sometimes once in a while you do too
every now and then maybe maybe we'll
bring maybe maybe this will be what
brings back the after parties Paul is
gettin is getting in xsplit gamecaster
subscription citing the guilt trip for
that or free yeah absolutely and then
what are you gonna do just listen to the
speakers listen to the game audio
through your speakers now you're gonna
need some nice earbuds you know some
quality some quality earbuds to take
advantage of a beautiful in-game sound
there's thunder gaming there's an X to
90 they are Sennheiser's they're fairly
high quality i I use Sennheiser
microphones I'm using one right now
it's the letter R stream okay it's got
its racked up some some street cred in
my book alright so there there's another
good thing and then what LEDs yeah who
doesn't want LEDs I mean you've already
got and the cable modular cable mod LEDs
they
money they've sponsored you in the past
clearly they're providing an abundant
even if they hadn't sponsored me I'd
still recommend him because I mean any
LEDs really cuz I mean you've got just a
ton of LEDs on the motherboard already
what are you just gonna not light up the
rest of your case that's how balance is
I got a x300 what there's a typo in
there I thought it was CX 3.00 but it's
just CX 300 for the headphones oh yeah
they're $40.00 headphones by the way
okay but see like sennheiser $40
headphone and you're not allowed to
research things while I'm arguing that's
 oh my god that's just a rule if
there's a rule that ring faxon's
decision we made just now so uh the $40
Sennheiser headphones are like $500
you know Skullcandy headphones anywhere
else so um and then what was the other
thing a hoodie right I I don't know
about you Paul
but when I game I like to keep it pretty
chilly in my room you know it's better
for thermal you know keep those keep the
ambient low keep the overclocked sighs
what I always say anyone who knows me
tell you Kyle says that every time I see
him since catchphrase face so obviously
I want to be comfortable on gaming I
need a frickin hoodie what better way to
wear a hoodie that is also free
advertising for the motherboard I happen
to hurt senator yes
always remember guys so uh I think I I
think I knocked that argument out of the
park let's see you try that's great
that's great
all right I should briefly consider what
I'm gonna argue here all right I'm gonna
go for the Corsair hydro series the age
75 because I will spend
I don't exactly phrase it like this but
I think the option here should be the
Corsair Hydra series age 75 why because
it is a practical solution it is
something that will you will need
because you I mean you're buying an X
series CPU from Intel these don't come
with water coolers these don't come with
any kind of cooler they need a cooler so
obviously you're gonna need a
motherboard so you're buying the
motherboard and then you just get the
cooler for free
it's a $75 value it's way more than the
crappy headphones that Kyle was talking
about just a second ago and you know all
that other stuff that you might get with
the with that gigabyte deal and I'm sure
it's I'm sure it's like passable quality
but it doesn't add up
this is $75 that and the quality of the
Corsair Hydra Series components all
either the age 75 I mean if you're gonna
we've already heard the 7900 X tends to
run a little warm you're gonna want to
liquid cool that bad boy so I think
that's what you're gonna want to do I
would argue further but I think I made
my point and we're low on time so let's
see what you guys have to say results
Wow damn people he's staggering is just
destruction but hey you did you did win
though apart from the people who are
just completely interested in X 299 30%
hey that's 50 people that's fit that's
50 motherboard sales right there all
night we just made for gigabyte 22
motherboard sales we just made for
Messiah
I'm deaf obviously assuming everyone who
voted is gonna immediately go and make a
purchase we did have we did have the
lead at least some people representing
and just being like you know what I was
gonna jump into this no matter what
there are the longtime uh
Intel high-end desktop platform
enthusiasts out there who we're into it
I mean hey if you got the money the
high-end CPUs are really fast yeah and
until we can test thread Ripper it's the
best we got those yeah the best we got
for now so um there we go all right
let's move into news tech news
discussion again we got some stories
here we're going to discuss but we'll
try to run through quickly I'm going to
start off with a quick reminder an
update on net neutrality which is
currently in peril in the United States
I'm trying to at least give you guys a
quick reminder of this every day
right now the FCC has an open forum
where you can go and you can make
comments who knows what they're going to
listen to those comments maybe like
Norris but Netflix for their part we
thought Netflix had abandoned us the CEO
of Netflix basically said you know for
everything we've done for net for net
neutrality and
and being a proponent for it and
everything and being sort of that the
test case for it because Netflix being
throttled was one of the very specific
things you could point out and be like
hey
and that's Internet service providers
are are missed are miss handling their
responsibilities as Internet service
providers and they're throttling stuff
simply because they don't want to
provide the bandwidth that people have
paid for which is something stupid the
Internet service providers do Netflix
CEO basically was like you know what at
this point we're big enough we can just
buy our way out of it so we don't care
quite as much as net about net
neutrality anymore which which kind of
sucked people were disappointed but they
they did jump in recently and at least
tweeted and said they will never outgrow
the fight for net neutrality and they
tweeted out something for battle for the
net which is one of the grassroots
organizations that's been pushing for
awareness about net neutrality and
everything so on July 12th there's an
internet wide day of action to save net
neutrality hopefully you guys will at
least be aware of this maybe be
knowledgeable about it so you can
explain its people there's an insane
number of large internet based
organizations that are participating in
this not least of which is pornhub right
there
github Kickstarter Netflix is now
involved fight for the future of course
Amazon reddit i mean like all over the
sites that you go to I mean I'm probably
not all the sites you go to but a lot of
the sites they make one hub imager a
port hub come on horn hub is X videos in
here I'm probably not I don't know they
should they should jump in here too
though yep the point is there's a ton of
internet-based organizations who are
doing this basically because they all
agree that internet traffic should all
be treated equally and from point A to
point B it should go from point A to
point B you can pay your provider for a
certain amount of bandwidth and after
that they should leave their hands off
of your data right now the net
neutrality rules that are in place that
went into effect in 2015 are under
scrutiny they're potentially going to be
rolled back by the current FCC and
would suck and a lot of people agree on
that again after all of the feedback
people give and after all of the
protests that go on and that kind of
thing they might still do it and that
will suck but at least people have tried
to make their voice heard and keep that
in mind for when it comes time for the
voting public to make something happen
the next time around
speaking of by the way if you weren't
sure what has happening on July 12th on
the internet wide date of action to save
that neutrality you're going to see
websites that display images that
basically give people a vague idea of
what might happen if net neutrality
rules go away and if Internet service
providers are able to throttle or limit
bandwidth or limit accessibility to
certain web sites because they don't
have a deal set up with them where the
websites paying the money or something
like that so do you think everyone's
just gonna like self-sabotage their own
sites and make them yes flow so like
this is what you're looking at so don't
think it's something it's something like
a blackout or a boycott I mean it's up
it's up to different websites to treat
it however they can some some websites
will just show a message to spread
knowledge other web sites will actually
be blocking their content and people go
there will not be able to access the
stuff that they were able to access
before by I download all my porn well I
mean having something saved locally you
know it's important but yeah firsthand
experience so I yeah the SOPA if you
guys remember was a so pass legislation
was going through the United States
government and there was a blackout that
they and an Internet slowdown that they
did to protest that so these are just
ways of making it known and again
there's lots of attempts to make this a
political issue and it really shouldn't
be because this is sort of a fundamental
premise of how the internet was like how
like what the internet was built upon
which was just the free sharing of
information the free sharing of data and
anyway I talked enough about that let's
move up all right
Chinese scientists have built the first
quantum satellite network this is
actually pretty freakin badass
almost going to include this in tales
from space but the Chinese Academy of
Sciences launched a satellite back in
August August this satellite is capable
of distributing quantum entangled
photons between three different
terrestrial base stations separated by
as much as 1,200 kilometers on the
ground what does I mean
so satellites up in space it creates
quantum entangled photons it does this
with a crystal that it uses to produce
pairs of entangled photons quantum
entangled photons basically if something
happens to one of them the same thing
happens to the other of them so no
matter what distance they're separated
by it's potentially a means of
instantaneous communication from one
point to another with quantum
entanglement hmm which is which is a
physical property of quantum mechanics
and everything which again I don't know
enough about to give you too many
details on but the satellite which is up
in space uses a crystal creates a couple
a quantum entangled photons distributes
those sends them down to base stations
on earth and those base stations have
been able to basically detect changes
between those two photons up to a
distance of 1,200 kilometers to transmit
it up to a distance of 2,400 kilometers
from the satellite down to those base
stations it is often very difficult to
distribute photon pairs without
disrupting the quantum entanglement but
if you can the result is a communication
channel that's effectively impossible to
intercept and again it's also
instantaneous regardless of the distance
between the separated photons so will
this eventually replace snapchat for
sending dick pics potentially yes the
simplest application right now is what
cryptographers call a quantum key
distribution network using the network
to securely distribute long and complex
and Crick encryption keys which are then
impossible to to be seen by anyone or at
least it's detectable if it is so that's
why some of the articles on this are
saying that's that China has developed
like a foolproof
quantum entanglements encryption method
that's completely unser available that
is possible with the further
proliferation of this technology and
knowledge in this field but at this
point this is just a step like kind of a
next step it's a demonstration of
something that hasn't been done before
and continue demonstration of quantum
entanglement continuing to be a thing no
matter how far apart the photons are
which again has been known in theory but
very difficult to accomplish in practice
that's pretty cool
beyond what's going on in China there's
also collaboration between the United
Kingdom's
University of Strathclyde and the
National University of Singapore they're
also hoping to produce the same
entanglement and cheap ready-made
satellites called cube SATs so perhaps
more practical use or more cheap or less
expensive way of setting up something
like this hmm
that's kind of cool all right my name's
Gaines as always MSI's announced the
geforce gtx ten atti lightning z yeah uh
if this video should no there's not oh
wait others like me and Z I haven't seen
the Lightning car from no sign in a
while well I feel like I had a dream
about light had a noise recently at
980ti lightning look there's Linus's
video it was the ri9 review just being
suggested to you well it's a very
suggestive video here's MSS video than
I'm the lightning look at all that
lightning going across there it's a try
frozer cooler design with torques 2.0
fans it's actually got three fans that
are asymmetrical so the two on the
outside are tons new ten centimeters the
Elana Strix
one middle is nine centimeters it does
from that angle looks similar to the
Strix if you if you notice that just
like here's the corner the edges just
that oh my god but they do have you can
swap out those panels if you want and
make them different colors so they're
not lights but physically you can change
them or they guess have some textured
ones on there there's an RGB accent
lighting panel here along the
edge MSS mystic light software chips
with an ln2 bios version i imagine for
actually record-breaking overclocking
and that kind of thing with this
graphics card they're probably going to
be using hacked v bios's allow them to
get past some of the voltage limitations
that nvidia has put in place it's
repressed for the sets there you go um I
you know what I don't think I don't
think it says no they're just announcing
it maybe not Sarah price it's probably
like eight hundred and fifty dollars
that's my guess
Jesus seriously I don't know well 1080i
is like seven hundred great 806 a 15
though I mean it's a flagship it's the
bet it's the best one they're gonna make
yeah but seriously 800 measure dollars
I don't know 800 I'm just 802 I'm just
throwing some what's up nothing more
doable the power delivery on here is
pretty insane it's a 10 layer PCB and a
14 phase power delivery you can see a
lot of the chokes caps and MOSFETs right
there 14 phases for the GPU and 3 phases
for the memory so you can also tell like
power delivery is pretty crazy because
it's got three eight pins PCI Express
power connectors the the cooler on it
has set is capable of 700 watts of heat
dissipation which is also crazy overkill
there's sort of an exploded view of the
entire thing so it's crazy my goodness
hi I'm 1080i and I'll have to see if
like 50 dollars listen it's it's always
like the toss up like this GPU the the
EVGA is when the one for EV the that one
I see X no not the I see X the the
kingpin the kinkajou
maybe EVGA is kingpin edition what's it
what's a to Scott at the highest end
they have their Poseidon card but I
don't think that's their crazy overclock
Seymour so water cooling they have their
Strix card I don't know I don't know if
I don't know if ace just has one in the
word
it's kind of similar to this Mars Mars
open bar that was a that was those were
AMD cards though yeah it's true it'd be
cool to see them bring that back like if
there's a dual Vega like to see aces do
another Mars GP will do a Vega that IV
that would be Marcus for right yeah yes
I would agree and I'm alright one more
quick story to talk about before we
switch over to cows have the show Atari
look at look at this thing Atari did by
the way chat is saying your beer is
getting hot and flat Paul I'm sorry I
haven't I've been talking I'll be
drinking more on couch a multitask be a
multi-core CPU not a single thread bitch
look at this Atari video ok wait Atari
ok all around what are they doing the
Atari box oh wait is this Atari CEO has
said that they are back in the hardware
business well has this teaser video here
with not much to be seen that wasn't me
I hate teaser videos so much look at see
you can see like the sides of it look at
that look at that wood wood wood grain
it's kind of got sort of a retro feel to
it still but it's all digital well I
guess it's always my visual but so what
is this a big cabinet the giant cabinet
with no I know that's something smaller
um they all right so there's really very
vague stuff known about this but they
say it's years in the making it is based
on PC technology and the article which
is from hexxus net again speculates that
this is a shot at the profitable retro
green rich retro gaming retro games
bandwagon that has been shown to be
highly lucrative by NES is NES
Nintendo's NES mini does any NES mini
right they launched it's impossible to
find it's like five times the price on
eBay for anyone who wanted buy it sold
out everywhere they're like god this is
limited edition screw any when it wants
us and those of us who understood we're
like why don't people just make an
emulator or use an emulator it's not the
cool factor kind of yeah it doesn't have
the cool factor I understand I'd I mean
I say practically speaking
get an emulator place play some old
games I want to but I understand the
nostalgic feel something like this
emulators are also sort of on in the
gray area of
legality yeah so well if there are those
if you owned the games like incipio K
because of course just the games in the
past but you look at the percentage of
emulator users who actually own the
games that they are emulating and it's
or I would imagine probably pretty
slowly that's why we have to establish
strong moral codes so that people can
police themselves I feel like like like
companies like Nintendo should have
emulator stores like they should sell
the emulators themselves oh oh yeah I
mean certainly there's like there's been
lots of suggestions and possible ways
that they could have monetized their
previous existing ip's but the NES mini
is one of those but you know clearly
they want they want to limit that
because it's like here's this and it
plays this number of games and that's
what you get
yeah you know but it's like any it's
like if you if you had some old favorite
Nintendo game that was very obscure
something like that like you can't just
load it up on the NES mini like that
sucks so anyway that's the theory but we
don't really know for sure
maybe Atari is coming back in like
there's going to be a third console
player in the console market now
probably not that's probably not what's
going on
who knows maybe it could be what about
what most what this most likely is is it
some sort of PC or PC based or whatever
you know core that they've got in there
I feel like it's Atari they could run it
off of a freaking they could run it off
of a an old printer or something like
that
I'm glad you're half of the show is
coming soon prior to talking anyway
probably it's going to be you know some
basic electronics in there running an
emulator that allows you to load up and
plug into a current you know HDMI
connection and play retro Atari games
most likely on your buddy or whatever
but who knows maybe it's something else
it's called Atari bucks though and
they've teased it and now you guys are
somewhat aware of it okay sounds like
fun let's real quickly go over some
donations since quite a few have donated
during Murph oh I totally forgot to do a
thing oh my god there's so many really
all right I'll try to do it quick I've
completely lost I also forgot to do this
but sell I'm pretty sure you're watching
right now
so on Kyle's half of the show if you
could I mean you're always watching chat
to find like a few random chat questions
that are good questions that aren't
donation comments and pull those at two
yes I feel like we do the donation
comments but it'd be cool to answer a
few comments from people who maybe just
don't have money to throw around because
I don't know people in that situation
anyway the automatic Matt five dollar
donation thank you for consistently
donating so much hey guys welcome back
for another week if you decide if you're
making custom HTPC automatic Matt I have
not fully decided that yet actually I
need to go back and check my my my straw
polls on that one but I'm looking I'm
very actually very excited to set that
up because I've been looking forward to
reconfiguring that but I'm still not a
half percent on how I'm going to set
everything up custom water cool it yeah
probably I get a custom mark but maybe
it makes perfect sense uh Tom's brim
Smith's 50n okay which was that
Norwegian Corona and so what that is
yeah I think so we're getting into that
once again greetings from Norway yes I
was right here's something for beer and
after Intel xd9 and bullcrap yeah um she
isn't much cheese cheese cheese flippin
Fred five dollars
you ready Paul on getting those beer
glasses tonight Cheers
okay good hold I got the big one JD key
three for the ten dollars thank you all
for the Vince to both of you they have
taught me so much something that I would
like to see a vexer plasma ram being
used with Rison oh maybe what GPU works
best with rising five fifteen hundred
fifteen hundred x so one thing I'll say
about the vex your plasma Ram it buzzes
buzzes don't you used in your one silly
video yeah right yeah yeah there's a
little buzz that it makes which is
annoying
I mean if it's in if it's in enclosed
somewhere like it's not very noticeable
isn't the same stuff that I use like the
Raiden is just the readin that he's
talking about or just like that this is
the actual plasma the effects here yeah
you know they also written it's the
plasma stuff the one that's in the the
Manta custom water-cooled bill that I
did however that I don't remember that
enough it's right behind it's right
behind or no god you're going to get it
no are you just open you yeah yeah
that's stuff okay that's
yeah I bump the camera okay little focus
okay yeah that stuff it does it doesn't
make sort of a weird it kind of makes a
little buzzing noise just know just keep
that in mind again if it's enclosed it's
not that terrible I know I know there
was a new list of memory that was just a
for Rison that was just released that
has a bunch of different memory kits
that are compatible now especially with
the new Ajitha but I would be interested
to potentially try they have extra
plasma ram I'm not sure if the plasma
stuff would interfere with the signal at
all I make it makes it lowing any any
more difficult for running at higher
frequencies but thank you for your
donation yep they're right genic $5
upgrade question currently an FX 6300
fatality motherboard from has Arakawa
horizon 5 what would you suggest budget
is $400 uh 400 even if it's more to told
and yeah I mean at same for a 1600 yeah
that's kind of what you want because you
want more than four cores and you can
unlock and anyone to be able overclock
and that's that's a good way to get in
on it go for a be 350 motherboard yeah
you don't need a an X 370 and you can
save 20 to 50 bucks by going that route
and then ya get your get your basic
phone cord components together focus on
that for the for the with your 500 bucks
and then worry about stuff like
upgrading your case maybe means 400 ish
for the CPU and motherboard since that's
I hope so those are probably the only
two components you'd have to upgrade he
could what helps look with everything
out in which case you should have my own
daughter for those two components yeah
thank you though Adam Kerschbaum $5
donation building computer with a budget
around $1500 should I go with a risin 5
1600 or horizon 7 1700 what point is
having 10 are gonna be overkill I'd say
for that much money go for the 1700 yeah
an extra cores and threads okay unless
that's the difference between like a
1080 TI and a 1080 I don't know it's a
good question
yeah you get a couple more cores and and
I'd want to go for the higher core count
just because it's a core 16 thread you
you go that squeeze a 1080i in there
yeah
probably we can squeeze in the 10 atti
and the 1700 which I feel like you
should be able to do for but here's a
thing 200 if getting if lowering his
standards to a 1600 meant getting a gtx
980ti that would also introduce a bit
more bottlenecking and I feel like
unless he was gaming at a higher
resolution which I feel like he's either
at 1080 or 1440 so I would I would I
would just go for the faster CPU and I
feel like if you even if you get a 1070
you're in really good shape for a while
yeah um 1080 but you want the higher end
ones because 1070 is this overpriced
trainer that's true if you're in the
u.s. muster deck Mac 5 bucks no comment
thank you deck Mac thank you very much
Adam Yeager $5 donation Paul how are you
tennis on your Noctua air cooler build
tried it and found the fans pointing up
increased my temps by 8 C is this your
HTTP or HTTPS time I see well it's my
capture system
I've only thumb's basic testing and
temps work Vaught we're totally fine
from what I tested but I'm not done
overclocking or anything like that
unfortunately I can't test changing
those two configurations with mine
because I can't I physically cannot do
the vertical configuration I had to go
horizont horizontal with it so there it
is um but yeah I mean my attempts have
been totally good so far though so yeah
there you go let's be driven hundred
freakin dollars out my mom oh my god mmm
Adam Yeager torch ugh well this is stout
I don't know if I can check this uh
let's get this started right drop us a
follow on YouTube and let us help you
build an awesome hardware mining rig
with your extra cards from bits be
trippin Wow ah God now you have to look
into it now you at least have to look
into it cuz he gave you hundred dollars
that's how it works well or or you could
be like nah screw you I'll take the
hundred bucks but ya know I mean again
at like I have I have I don't if we can
find a way to make it work Paul I don't
you inaudible building a mining rig if
you
it's running it's running the mining rig
somewhere that where you don't have
access to either solar or hydropower or
something all set up we'll set up a
solar solution we'll set it up okay
it'll be a great vlog series it'll be a
cross collaboration between you anyway
I'm also in will profit I mean like
Annie
I'm so if I if I don't put a positive
spin on this cryptocurrency thing what
I'm kind of hoping happens at least from
the standpoint of gamers is that by the
time q4 rolls around and people are
spending money on like you know Black
Friday deals and that kind of thing and
because there's so many options for
building systems then there's just going
to be a crap ton of used cards on the
market that like drops prices for
everything once the kind of bubble
bursts or once Asics are developed that
can actually do that kind of mining or
something like that but all that said
I'll look into it obviously
okay so bits be driven thank you for the
hundred dollar donation hashtag ad oh my
god
Colton Spears ten dollars my mining rig
with six five ATS brings in a little
over a thousand dollars a month and
costs one hundred two hundred and fifty
dollars in electricity it's not bad
that's not bad at all I'm wondering
where you're located yeah but yeah but
that's pretty nice with six five ATS
that's that's a good stack right we'll
buy a place in Arizona and it'll just be
a house full of GPUs yeah
just Monday night all right well work on
Andruw Jones five dollars in California
would still be profitable to hit point
four zero kilowatt hours I don't know
the rates so you would have to do the
math we don't know how to I know that my
rates are always high because I work
from home and I work with computers so
I'm always going up to the higher tiers
of pricing which is always a challenge
for me so that's why yeah it'd be a very
much a challenge sebastian Casella
twenty a RS i don't know what IRS is
Argentina's Gardea is that as Noah be a
third gated ours for diya would be we be
available to use PayPal and as guardian
as Guardi is free you have to pay for as
Gardea I don't know what you're gonna
have to pay once they create those
floating garni is free but if you were
making transactions within as Gardea if
you're buying stuff on on the S guardian
internet or no they're probably gonna
have their own Internet
right the problem is probably gonna be a
separate internet for us Gardea and so
they're gonna have gonna be you know a
bunch of like the 1990s where all the
rich people like right in the future
like living on earth actually on the
planet is gonna be shitty everything's
gonna suck everybody's gonna be really
limited resources and people are gonna
fight each other in La Casa and this is
gonna be a scardy at these floating
platforms will pop up above naked women
everywhere there's a movie like this
right you word Elysium Elysium is the
same one yeah yeah it's basically and be
Elysium yeah some humongous five pounds
sterling yo you did a good review on the
verdaguer chair actually that was Kyle
hey how'd you get a hundred fifty
thousand views on a chair video don't
know my god it's the buzz informing
chair video well done sir
thank you can you do one hurt Herman
Miller chair and compare them because
the Herman Miller chairs I think we're a
thousand bucks or something shares are
not something I ever seek out this is
supposed to be the the pinnacle of
chairs of their nightly so I've heard PS
cider is better in its ear Ennis you're
in a your Ennis Uranus Uranus yeah
that's just not as fun it's nowhere near
as fun but thank you give you guys of
course half $10 last week I was mean
sexually aggressive to Kyle I meant it
yeah you Kyle love you Paula winky
face Thank You Leigh like you lay on
you're my favorite I'm glad you cleared
that I appreciate your honesty code cut
uh
I'm hiccupping goo dude ten bucks
haven't caught you guys for a while
cheers hey cheers to you as well no
don't you keep saying jeez automatic
Matt's $5 again Jesus I hope do you ever
quit just check new egg and only found
the hyper cloud X as a gift with
gigabyte huh maybe Jake has Davey check
the hexxus article that that's linked in
the description because it says the UK
oh my qualifying buyers and I think it's
only with Oris boards so if you're I
think there's a couple naw Norris
gigabyte boards so those might even so
though I probably take a hyper cloud x
over all that stuff right X those are
great heads and nice options yeah there
you go Stephen Louis $5 EJ makes a GTX
1060 for the wind plus I noticed that
they also have another version called
EVGA GTX 1060 for the win plus DT do you
know what the DT means
no no I honestly have no idea
double-double trouble trouble down two
and then you'll never know what it's
down to do hey I'm not sure uh Ichi if
you're on Twitter tweet to EVGA Jacob
yeah ask that guy he VJ Jacob F and
maybe he can tell you I'm sure there's
something
yeah the DT gaming what what's the deal
there DT D what why have I never heard
of this and even has them the boxing the
ring a Dan
I'm confused damn trippy date dang
that's double ball bearings is it the
fan detuned people are saying DT tuned
that's okay so what does that mean I
don't know do you tuned like you have a
guitar and you detune it now it's out of
tune I don't I'm not sure yeah I mean
I'm mad I detuned sounds somewhat
reasonable I mean EJ's makes things
alright
ah a little more expensive than let's
move on I'm sorry we couldn't answer
that for you but um maybe Jacob can't
you stumped us I'll have your reviews $5
donation hey guys big fan from San
Francisco Bay Area
hey any advice for a noob youtuber
trying to grab my channel do it cuz you
love it don't do it because he lots of
people you want lots of people to watch
you yeah do it do it cuz you've got the
passion you gotta have it in you
you're gonna gotta be made of the stuff
mom beyond that I would say look for
collaborations find people who are
around your channel sighs and there
always be lots of them whether you've
got a thousand followers or whether
you're ten thousand or whether you're at
fifty thousand find anyone who's kind of
in that range collaborate with them make
sure they you know they do legitimate
content reach out to them and say hey
let's let's do a collaborative giveaway
or a video where we each go in
talk about something because getting
your face on to other people's videos
even if you're all sort of relatively
smaller when it comes to the ground
scheme of things is a great way of
boosting your exposure indeed it's were
a much more Katelyn Parker $10 you guys
helped me build a PC for the first time
with your videos while being thoroughly
entertained appreciate your
personalities and approach have a
brewski on me
we will thanks Caleb boo boo Kayla Kayla
awesome she's on a cord for the five
dollars five dollars - Kyle is fat
shaming me by not carrying 2x flash bios
and cpu cooler shirts I am so sorry Sean
I did not get this to fat shame you in
that indirect way is Jon still still on
vacation just came back oh he's back our
t-shirt guy is back we'll be restocking
those very shortly actually I think
they're on the printer right now yeah
the big big sizes I'm all I'm free of
 all right why are we going so late
Fred rant 50 freaking dollars
Fred Fred thank you which motherboard
brand do you think is the best Asus MSI
EVGA added some extra since I missed you
guys uh and whatever is reload answer
that click is missed you last week uh
alright
I like Asus yeah I mean okay there's
there's some sentimental value to Asus
for me because it was my first
motherboard ever back in 2012 when I
when I built my first ever it was a
Sandy Bridge system on I actually I have
the board somewhere up there somewhere
anyway it was an Asus board and I really
just I've had really good experiences
with with Asus boards in the past
especially their BIOS I feel like when
I'm in the UEFI I feel like it's a
really stable BIOS it doesn't have any
weird sort of issues that I've
experienced on competitor boards I don't
know if you can say the same thing but
Asus has always seemed very reliable to
me over the last one six six years or so
I mean if you look at the sizes of the
companies Asus is the biggest then Asus
and gigabyte have kind of gone back and
forth when it comes to market share
gigabyte did have more motherboard ship
to the nicest I think a year or two ago
but they've kind of gone back and forth
I feel like Asus has the most developers
that put the most put more man-hours
into the development of them
boards and I really love the rog series
because i feel like they have done a lot
of innovation and like crazy stuff on
that platform it seems to trickle down
to the competitor yes really and which
trickles down to the other asus boards
and also over to competitors because
you'll find lots of stuff that asus did
first at other motherboard manufacturers
and me alone will pick up all that said
you can get a very high-quality fine
functional working mother word from any
of those manufacturers i mean asus
gigabyte and msi are typically at the
top EVGA you might add in specifically
on the intel side they don't do a and b
stuff then probably as rock is up there
as well yeah but yeah i mean if if a CSS
is down fall and my experience is its
motherboards where there's just too much
stuff going on you're like like the
higher-end motherboards sometimes I've
had situations I'm like there's too many
things and more moments earlier and it's
any and it's causing hop complex or
something like that but yeah I've tried
it agree as Kyle and overall we
typically go with Asus yeah but again we
have friends and other manufacturers as
well this is my Google $5 a donation I
don't know what a czar what PC hardware
trends changes do you think we'll see
between now in the first half of 2018
ddr5 more HBM the death of our GP that
is a big question that we do not have
time to fully answer right now but I
think if you go back in this video we
did talk about certain stuff like that
gddr5 x and g GD r 6r right on the
horizon HBM to ddr5 i don't see coming
at any time in the near future but
hopefully in the next year and a half to
two years we'll probably see an HP m to
potentially death of RGB is not going to
happen no all right dylan spires thank
you for the $10 donation thanks both for
all the great content how viable is a
1600 k10 ATT I build for content
creation editing and gaming very very
good found a 60 under K for 300 u.s.
dollars or should I lean toward rise in
for productivity if you can get a good
deal on a sixty hundred K I would say go
for it yeah that's a great option
especially if you're combining it with a
1080 TI you should get a little bit
better gaming performance thanks to the
slightly better IPC performance with the
6100 k compared
rise in CPS Luis Herrera five dollars
and sixty nine cents that's very
specific what did you think of the
Corsair air 740 I never worked with it
you didn't build me with it yeah I
didn't build with it uh perfectly
adequate case plenty of room lots of
space to work with wide footprint it's
larger aesthetic is love or hate I think
yeah but I feel like it looks a lot
better in person well I was like when I
saw your video if it was like that's
weird I don't know how I feel about that
and then I went to your garage when I
went to your place and Sutton person I
was like that looks pretty sick actually
I don't know that was just me but I feel
like you have to be there to to really
appreciate it yeah I like different I
like it it lacks the tempered glass that
some of the some of the cases from this
year have but if you're looking for a
wider case like that and you want lots
of room that it's it's certainly very
very nice case also the fans that ship
with are very quiet too which is nice
Bevan Johnson ten dollars a donation
again as I think that's Australian
perhaps how hot do LED strips get I'm
looking to get him on a light saber toy
to my light f2 light of my PC Bevan I'm
not not be concerned about LED Heat
unless they're directly up against
something that you're concerned about
getting too hots like your balls yeah
but by-and-large LEDs I mean they're hot
if you touch them but anything that's
further than like a centimeter away it's
not gonna affect too badly so don't be
don't be too concerned with that you go
for it on customize your PC Rob crib $2
donation taxation is theft couldn't
agree more
des Jones $5 donation one month and a
half before the Ripper is released the
hype is real I'm excited
me too rob crib $20.00 I believe again
Australian donation also saying that
taxation is theft again as a reminder
Rob you're you're doing the Lord's work
I couldn't agree you might need to
remind us one more time okay I am a
$9.99 $5 donation hi guys any points
going from a 4790k to 6600 k for gaming
and streaming i have a gtx 980ti and run
triples triple monitors I'm really not
47 92 6600 know that's a GPU thing okay
your graphics card if you're going to
run triples your CPU will only do it's
it's not going to be worth
I feel like you're going to scale a lot
better if you upgrade to like the gog
takes 1080i or maybe even two of them
upgrading your cpu will only probably
net you no more than a five percent gain
in FPS to be honest yeah i would drop in
another 1080 iron 980ti before i before
i upgraded that keep your eye on higher
core count options in the next year and
a half and then and then that's what you
should look to upgrade pup Shepherd $5
donation what time do you stop taking
pip my PC after you tweet I sent one
pimp mine s also I have up to 283 subs
now thank you thank you pop a really
depends when proc refers to subs anyway
so what we do okay what shoutouts is so
so clean
wrist sigelei um alright so uh it really
depends it depends on how half an hour I
am for the show half an hour if I'm not
prepared at all then I'll be taking
submissions up until 5:00 29 p.m. but if
I'm like feeling good and I like prepare
in the morning and shade ahead I have a
 on lock then you know you probably
have a half hour window after the time I
send the tweet but if you can make it on
today or this week then try again next
week oh my god these things up forever
thank you pup my goodness alright Fred
rant fifty-one dollar donation no one
beats me here's another 51 dollars to
make the sub one hundred and one dollars
Oh ready you win you a winner and I'm
sure no one no one else will win more
than you go on a rant with donation the
right connect another five dollar
donation a donor character sucks need
info on specific 350 and RAM for the
1600 unless ddr3 RAM will work my risin
motherboard you guys will not work you
need ddr4 and you need ddr4 that works
with Rison and again there was a list
that was released either today or
yesterday ram updated ram compatibility
list and i don't immediately know where
to get it but AMD or AMD risin on
twitter or Thrax robert Halleck would
probably also be posting about about
that and you can find that ram list but
use that Ram list to make sure you get
RAM that's validated to run at a higher
frequency if you can get stuff that runs
at
29:33 at 3200 a solid kit of say 16 gigs
go for that I would also say try to
stick with 2 sticks if you can because
you have a better chance of getting
higher frequency so like 2 by 8 for 16
gigs as opposed to 4 by 4 as opposed to
4 by 4 yeah is a better option that Scot
Dilbeck six dollars and sixty six a
super metal rate my build i7 7700 K
Strix Z 270 crossfire are X 480 Strix 16
gigs of ram 1 terabyte SST SSD probably
4 terabyte mechanical Scout 2 case each
ATI cooler thanks guys
um I think that's a pretty solid rig
looks very solid I'd say on your
graphics card is probably the place
where you could use an upgrade the 7700
K can easily push something way higher
end than that you're probably doing just
fine with your R X 480 especially if
you're loading crossfire that's
crossfire yeah oh so he's got two of
them
alright well you got two of them which
are X 480 if you're gonna if you're
gonna do SLI or crossfire the I feel
like the our X 480 scales pretty well
that's a good bang for the buck
probably not in every game so as soon as
you feel like more of the games that
you're playing are starting to not
support crossfire as much as you'd like
them to then may be considered just
opting for a single faster GPU maybe
Vega yeah when it comes out yeah drop a
couple vega's in there when that
launches
Deus the Vega hodad's $5 the DT cards do
not pass the same level of testing as a
normal for the winged cards ship at a
lower frequency but still have the other
extra for the one features yeah thank
you coda that's very useful and that is
very useful bronzy for the win $5
hey guys have an i7 4790k was thinking
about it getting X 299 should I do it or
wait til coffee lake don't want to do
AMD if you don't want to do MD and you
know you don't want AMD then go for
extra 99 the only thing I think coffee
lake might provide is a 6 core that's
kind of on the same level as the 7700 K
right now 71 100 K right now or the 77
40 K on the X to end and I are still
going to be your peak X game 7-7 40 X is
still going to be your peak gaming
performance right now like right now
right now yeah
I foresee potentially coffee like giving
you a mainstream 6-core option that also
has the same or better instruction of
your clock and frequency performances at
7700 K so that might be the potential
for waiting
all that said if you do other stuff if
you do anything besides gaming and again
you're absolutely sure you're not
interested in the AMD stuff then yes X
299 is where you want to be it's a 1 K
PC Worth also is a 1 K power supply
worth it probably not like a I guess you
mean a thousand watts it's usually a
little bit overkill most power most even
high-end pcs can get away with like 850
watts all that said I mean if it's a
good deal and go for it Chucky's tied
you dollar donation' drunken daddy

Dez Jones $2 donation have you seen the
ridiculous prices on X 299 motherboards

these hyper yeah 250 is kind of your
starting points for pricing right out of
