event is starting I'm streaming on a new
system that's a starting student soon
all right oh look it says it's live whoa
that's fine that's actually perfectly
good way to start the stream why not so
bear with us here right was that that's
twitch it's what you see twitch has been
with us the whole time yeah it's twitch
oh cool keeps working
all right cool cool cool all right this
is good excellent thank you for joining
us YouTube and sorry incredibly sorry we
are so late we're just to be specific
we're thirty-six minutes late today for
the youtubes you need a stream yeah that
is because we have a new streaming
system that we're streaming with it does
seem to be streaming well but we're also
using updated version of twitch which
apparently is actually tying in to the
YouTube control room things I actually
had to tell it on youtube to start the
stream right I thought I had told twitch
had xsplit xsplit to start stream had to
tell you to so anyway that's why we're a
little late a little later than we
already work anyway though this is
awesome hardware I think you guys for
joining us today this is episode number
146 and it's a live show about
technology computers and that kind of
thing and we stream every Tuesday
evening usually starting at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time although we're starting a
little after 6:00 today we're streaming
the first half of today's show episode
146 on my channel Paul's hardware and in
about an hour so we're gonna switch to
the second half on Kyle's channel bit
whit's the link to that should be in
this video's description if you're
watching also if you want watch the
entire thing and you wanted to watch us
fumble about with live stream settings
and whatnot for the past 15 minutes or
so then you can also watch on Twitch
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware we
stream the whole show and we are coming
at you live today and 1080 60 frames per
second
hell yeah look
super super sharp I'm just gonna take
advantage of the new frame rate and just
do this play already oh I feel like you
don't flail as much as he used to used
to flail more I'm trying to get back
into the flailing yeah the last video I
just recorded last night I was doing
this long did some more place is
basically just this well with like
darude-sandstorm in the background the
the audience seems to be enjoying it I
know what the people want PO will
continue and I give it to them a couple
things to mention here at the start of
the show we do drink some beer so feel
free to join us if you're of age and are
a capable of drinking responsibly only
drink responsibly people also if you're
really good at drinking it like Kyle is
here you can show off we also
occasionally use adult language on the
show so warnings for the youngers out
there
younger people look pretty nice you know
hide them away and stuff but cheers
thanks to you guys for joining us today
Cheers let me end off the beers yeah
feels like deja vu I knows we already
did it five minutes ago when we thought
we were alive to youtube but we weren't
that's why we're super Dale's Pale Ale
to start off from Oskar Blues brewery in
Colorado it's quite tasty
all that said if you really repeating
everything
if you guys want help support channel
check out our stores Paul's Harbor
dotnet is my store where we're out we're
finishing up the metallic silver
thumbscrew shirts they're super flashy
and they're very comfortable and it's a
try blend you know the the fabric is
very soft and everything spy stuff bit
without tech slash store you can buy
stuff from Kyle including the new
stainless steel bottle openers with the
the CPU cooler logo on them yep the
classic so Kyle's also got the new rip
game gamepad design rip game dad and I
guess we have to do an obligatory shadow
on the shirts that we're wearing they
were both wearing today if you want to
pick up a BIOS flash sure sure yeah
heather has had it
your name is Paul Paul is borrowing the
cotton shirt I'm wearing the Heather
shirt is where it
confused usually it takes a few more
drinks before you start just taking me
for headaches hey speaking of thanks
wishful thinking we're done with our
current ones so as we move on to the
first segment of my half do it Mobe up
ah yes the rogue the rogue cold brew IPA
haven't had that before
but sounds good though I've never had it
what does cold brew oh it's it's blended
with cold brew coffee yeah some kind of
interesting interesting give me too many
coffee IPAs give you a little extra jolt
of energy for your half of the show
I hope usually damped up as it is I
don't drink IPAs but I browsed the IPA
section at at BevMo in order to find
something for Kyle and I trust I trust
the the master Brewers at rogue they've
done a they've done me well in the past
so yep that's why I chose that one
reputable all right let's let's let's
move on here we're gonna start off with
the news segment I'm going to we're
doing a lot of stuff on the fly today
such as all of our Loretha we do that
every time all of our lower thirds
aren't like I need to I need to find my
news it's okay
didn't I didn't even think about it it
wasn't like I'll just make Paul do all
this shit on the spot and make him
suffer and laugh well he well he
struggles and unliving this a live
broadcast at first half of the show so
we get to know I get to go through all
that on my hat that's right okay so it's
back for tech news today we're starting
off with a bit of a bit of the old skull
but from an end tech it's got a but is
it why isn't ctrl+ working on this
doesn't today we'll be recapping in an
antique article in three short hours
this one from Ian Curtis and
specifically it's not like you
information derived from power stamp
Alliance I'm not familiar with power
stamp Alliance but now I know what they
are thanks to this article power stamp
Alliance has been formed to define a
standard product footprints and
functions that provide a multiple
sourced standard
modular board mounted solution for power
conversion from full 48 volt in to
low-voltage high-current applications
primarily targeting devices being used
in large data centers so it's it's
alliance of large companies in order to
create a standard so that they can
create they can all create hardware that
can be universal used in platforms in
the platform that they were have
specifically released some information
on is intel's not next-gen xeon platform
but the gen after that right now Xeon
the highest-end Xeon stuff you can buy
from Intel is based on skylake but
cascade Lake is what's supposed to be
next and the these the the code names
are typically applied to the
architecture and the architecture is
often used not just on like the
architecture will be used across
multiple platforms so right now there's
Zeon's based on skylake architecture you
can also buy mainstream CPUs as well as
enthusiast great CPUs based on skylake
architecture cascade lake is the next
codename for architecture that products
will be based on in 2018 after that is
ice Lake and that's listed at least in
the documentation referenced here is
coming out in 2018 slash 2019 so
possibly later this year or early next
year but there's also some some more
information in this and this is all from
a non tech so it's all pretty we can be
pretty confident this is all this is all
pretty accurate information here one of
the biggest things here I think is the
new socket its LGA 4189 yeah that's 4189
pins am typically LJ's references is is
referenced by the number of actually
actual pin contact points in each socket
that's 542 more pins than the current
xeon socket which is LGA 36:47 and that
currently supports skylake Zeon's as
well as the up came upcoming cascade
Lake Xeon family in this document though
because they're talking about early
signs for motherboards that will support
this platform for example they actually
say that's the the isolate stuff will
have the new socket LGA 4189 and also
that there will be some amount of
backwards compatibility between them the
the power pin so different different pin
outs on a socket some will have it be
for data connectivity some will be for
power delivery the power design is
supposed to be the same so there will be
a an adapter that you can get in order
to have some sort of backwards
compatibility a CPU adapter yeah this is
still far first this is still pretty
early information so like my guess here
would be something like the current
socket design is large enough to have
the extra pins edit in there and that
maybe there's a different adapter for
that will allow it to slot in there I
don't think this is something like like
a physical adapter like the old slot
mount CPUs or something like that I
doubt it's going that direction but it
does seem like there's some sort of
backwards compatibility that they're
talking about there at least when it
comes to the power delivery and that's
of course what this article is derived
from the the power stamp Alliance
because they do a lot of 48 volts power
components so there you go these are
sure the power is crazy the other
information that was also revealed from
the documents is power ranges for
cascade Lake at least when it comes to
the TDP for the CPUs cascade Lake will
have 165 to 205 Watts range 40 DPS which
is pretty similar to skylake which had
140 to 200 5 watt range ice Lake will up
that tour in 30 watts for the TDP so you
know you know you'll need some clan
accordingly you'll need some cooling
there and then when it comes to code
names that they're referencing in the
document there's one codename VR 13
which is for skylake in cascade Lake
parts and then there's VR 13
8c for ice Lake and the HD and this case
stands for high current so the typical
VR 13 HD implementation for an isolate C
on is going to be a 2 CPU configuration
with 16 ddr4 memory slots for each CPU
wants to move like a thread Ripper
yeah 16 per CPU so that means that like
I don't know what kind of motherboard
like I don't know if this is gonna fit
within current motherboard standards
like meses IC eb 16 per cpu and we're
talking about a a two CPU configuration
possibly and on separate motherboards
I'm not and I'm not really sure this is
all stuff that's probably out of the
range of most people cuz cuz it's server
grade stuff and really high-end server
grade stuff at that when they say that
VR 13h the implementation is two CPUs do
they mean two dies on one actual scene
up to separates twosome easy because
unlike a motherboard so here is server
board yeah so again because the
documents they're referencing are
largely large we're talking about power
delivery to the CPUs because that is
what the power stamp Alliance is
designing and establishing standards for
even so they have for example the 48
volt bus going across here two CPUs and
then all the ddr4 memory slots for both
it's eight channel ddr4 so that's pretty
quick crazy doubling doubling the quad
channel so I imagine there's an insane
amount of bandwidth available there but
again just that number of like if yes
it's so I have a feeling this is going
to be split on on a couple boards in a
system but who knows for sure again this
is this is that enterprise-grade stuff
that we don't dabble in that much but
the reason I bring it up here in general
is because a lot of times there's
trickle down especially on the Intel
side Xeon the enthusiast grade parts
like X 99 next to 99 they've all been
derived from Xeon stuff
the enthusiasts platform tends to more
aligned with with Zeon launches and it
does with them with mainstream launches
yeah so for that reason I'm just
speculating like Intel was was was kind
of blindsided by the thread Ripper
launch from AMD last year and suddenly
having competition in the high-end
desktop space right now Intel has X 299
and and the the skylake parts that are
that fit in there but what are they
gonna like are they gonna have some kind
of answer for for AMD and thread rupert
beyond the current platform that they
have or like what are they planning
that's next and this is just complete
speculation for me but given the
response from thread Ripper I feel like
it would be kind of cool if Intel was
like hey let's take some derivative of
this platform whether it's lg8 3647 or
than the LGA 4189 stuff they're talking
about and create some sort of enthusiast
Klatt platform enthusiast class platform
based on that right that'd be fun yeah
it'd be kind of cool last stat here was
that the maximum memory capacity of the
base xeon processors on the isolate
platform is up from 768 gigabytes to one
terabyte one terabyte of system memory
which is it's usually the minimum that I
I tried to roll with anyway guys again
the article from an antic is leaked in
the description and there's a lot more
detail there so feel free to read it
we're info next up from PC world and
Brad sharkus is Nvidia finally saying
goodbye not just to Fermi graphics cards
and that I'm saying say goodbye that's
very dramatic they're ending support for
Fermi graphics cards as well as 32-bit
operating systems support this is
announced on Friday April 6th and
probably not many people like will be
desktop users using 32-bit operating
system 64-bit has Murat been around for
a while and
excuse me I mean I haven't used 32-bit
operating systems since 2005 2006 2007 I
don't know right in that range somewhere
yeah that's like when I graduated high
school good lord
yeah most most often you hear about
people who are required to use a 32-bit
operating system in order to support
some old legacy software or something
like that but it has something to to
keep in mind I suppose if in particular
if you're using a 32-bit OS or if you
have an older graphics card specifically
a Fermi based graphics card the affected
systems that have either a 32-bit OS or
a Fermi based graphics card won't just
stop working all of a sudden they're
still going to function they're just not
going to get new performance
enhancements features or bug fixes there
is some continued support for critical
security updates until January 2019 so
you had another 8 months or so for that
also of note is that the GeForce
experience software which is optional
but a lot of people do use it will also
be dropping 32-bit operating system
supports the software that currently
exists will still work with 32-bit OS
game setting functions and that kind of
thing again it's just not going to get
updated beyond that so typically when
that happens people will still use it
for a little bit but at some point there
might be a security vulnerability or
something like that so it's it's it's
moving end-of-life so what which update
your operating system yeah but and if
you have if you still have a 500 series
you know Fermi graphics card or
something like that it's probably time
to upgrade anyway I would think possibly
I mean even like hopefully hopefully
graphics cards prices will continue to
drop if if not if not just for the sake
of like not burning down your house with
the GTX 580 just just just get that just
retire it already and get something that
doesn't pose a threat to you and your
family
good advice Kyle and they're all weak so
yeah as Kyle mentioned Fermi based
graphics cards in case you're not sure
what
exactly that entails oh oh I used the
one on my am like he's thanks very best
graphics cards from Nvidia or GTX 400
series of GTX 500 series graphics Kurt's
they were kind of notorious especially
in the 400 series for being very power
hungry and running pretty hot GTX 480 in
particular had a notorious reputation
for that good good excuse to water cool
of course the 500 series helps had a lot
of benefits our upgrades from the 400
series with power consumption and you
know still not non-functional cards or
anything by any stretch just again not
going to get future updates so you know
the triple a title that launches four
months from now won't have a game you
know a launch day ready tribe it will
have a lunch ready the launch day driver
for 600 series and above but not for
your older 500 series graphics card in
case you're what I want to compare this
to what AMD has done the the
counterparts at the time for the 400 and
500 series firming graphics cards from
Nvidia was AMD's Radeon HD 5000 at 6000
series graphics cards and those have
been legacy status since 2015 so Nvidia
for their part supported those cards for
one to three years beyond what Nvidia
I'm sorry what AMD supported their GPUs
for the time okay moving on moving on
the new horizon processors rise in two
as they are called they're coming out
soon we have confirmation from AMD that
they are launching on April 19th but
some global retailers have just been
shipping them out apparently supposedly
rumor has it according to these pictures
and everything and far be it for me to
call anyone a liar so our guys can view
these other retailers shipping them out
like in like are they are they breaking
any rules with or
tricks with AMD maybe I don't know
possibly hmm like its its regional right
like oh my my experience is with is
working with new egg and no egg was a
pretty sizable company when it comes to
being an end-user sales retail sales
outlet so you know there's back and
forth with companies you know obviously
AM DS probably not happy if this if this
actually is the case that these CPUs
were shipped to these people early you
know AMD has embargoes we can assume
going on with various outlets and that
kind of thing and they probably wouldn't
want this this happening because that
would detract from that but at the same
time you're trying to do a product
launch globally with many different
countries and many different outlets and
that kind of thing and it's not the
first time we've seen something like
this happened before so for better or
for worse it does seem again according
to these rumor articles that some of
these CPUs have gone out so there are
people who have been testing them and
this articles from hot or hardware which
is also derived a bit from I believe a
bit from a WCC F Tech article from a
risin 720 700 X benchmark leak and the
2700 X is supposed to be the highest end
CPU that's coming out with this upcoming
launch the basis of the article is
information posted by El Chapo's s
infirm and formatic oh I don't I'm sorry
if I'm pronouncing if I'm not
pronouncing that correctly
sounds like a reliable source yes they
were able to obtain a rise in 720 700 X
according to the article which is the 8
core 16 thread processor essentially the
successor to the 1800 X as as far as
what we have right now base stats are a
3.7 gigahertz base clock and a 4.3 5
gigahertz boost clock they ran it
through a series of benchmarks they were
testing it with an asrock mother
motherboard the x3
seventy killer SLI and several
motherboard manufacturers have already
posted BIOS updates for their boards for
compatibility with the resin to stuff
which allows you to actually slot these
CPS in and use them again assuming this
article is accurate so yeah some tests
they don't have the 1800 X in here but
they have a 1700 X in these comparison
numbers for some W Prime stuff does
still seem to be falling behind some of
the in cell comparison numbers here for
like the 8700 K it did seem to do better
on the second test W Prime but it should
be noted that anything that they're
using right now when it comes to the
software side driver support that kind
of thing is probably pre-launch yeah and
that can often cause some changes in
performance after launch
so there's 3dmark fire strikes score
with 2700 X and 32 hundred megahertz
memory coming in just behind the 8700 K
and there's a few other outlets
referenced an article for overclocking
the original article by L chap who's us
in Fairmount ago and we're only able to
overclock to 4.2 gigahertz across all
cores on there 2700 X at one point 4
volts but there's another website called
Hardware numbers and they actually have
a video linked in the article as well
they also apparently got a rise in 720
700 X and they got 4.3 gigahertz across
all cores and they were also at one
point 4 volts and they were using an
asus rog crosshair 6 hero also an
independence person in chile contacted
WCC eff tech with some overclocking
numbers that they had for an r5 2600
which is a 6 core 12 thread processor
which is probably going to be the
relevant successor to the 1600 and 1600
X that has a 3.4 gigahertz base 10 3.9
gigahertz boost and they overclocked it
to 4.0 5 gigahertz across all cores
within asrock
Tachi so again all these numbers are
early none of this stuff is launched
they're probably they're all these tests
have been done with current generation
hardware according to the article so
it's preliminary stuff maybe something
to get excited about if you're looking
at some of those higher frequencies
because you know getting beyond 4
gigahertz was pretty difficult with the
right with the first gen rise and stuff
but yeah we should all know more in
about 9 days because again April 19th as
when this launch is supposed to happen
I'd be curious to see if there's much of
a performance difference between X 370
and X 470 when you're talking about
overclocking anyway because I mean I
know X 470 the the one feature that it
does have over X 370 is exif r2 but if
you're overclocking and you're supplying
an all core frequency then that kind of
goes up the window so then I'm wondering
you know on top apart from that if if
you would still have a better
overclocking advantage on on the newer
chipset I don't know
I think I'm most curious about that
because that's the whole thing right
it's like this is exciting because a lot
of people jumped on to rise in first gen
because it was a great platform and then
we all have the promise of backwards
compatibility where we can you know you
can buy a new second generation chip and
slot it into an X 370 board but at what
cost
we shall see I'm very curious I think
most people will be overclocking they're
they're rising to chips so just gonna
assume you're joking about everything ha
ha that's funny yeah obviously we don't
know any of the details about any of
this stuff
oh I'm not under move again oh sure
Facebook has told us recently the data
on most of its 2 billion users is
vulnerable 2 billion users that's global
worldwide ok Facebook of course has been
under a fair amount of heat recently for
for various things
according to this article they removed a
feature recently that lets a user enter
a phone number or an email address into
Facebook's
search tool in order to find other
people specifically because it was being
used by malicious actors to scrape
public profile information as many as 87
million people in the most of them in
the US have had info information
improperly shared with research firm
Cambridge analytic and then there's also
talk of another research firm called
Palantir Mark Zuckerberg was interviewed
today
more like interrogated did you watch any
of that I want caught some of that I
didn't really watch it so it was
interesting it was really interesting I
felt bad for the guy yeah just like he
was like in front of like 30 people like
30 rich white old dudes just up there
just a lot of them hardcore
conservatives and stuffing questions and
just like just just getting hammered
with question after question like some
hard-hitting sophisticated questions and
he I thought he handled himself pretty
well to be honest and he was on under a
lot of pressure obviously but he was
very you know smart and concise with his
answers
it didn't seem like he was bullshitting
all that much and you could tell that
every dude up there was just trying to
like be the one that gave him the be the
one to stump him you know with like some
like really controversial question but
he kind of plowed right through it so
except for the ones that receives
substantial campaign donations justice
was not as per second Berg you know he's
only capable of acting within the
parameters of his of his software
programming it was interesting when
win-win questions regarding some of
these firms that have potentially been
misusing Facebook information came up
such as Cambridge analytic implants here
was when questions stopped being
answered as thoroughly according to what
I read but of course this all happens
just briefly earlier today the article
is actually from last week so
there's more there's more stuff just
from today and yesterday now
all this all this said there's there's
there's two sides to the coin here one
of them is like people who are upset
with Facebook and cancelling you know
deleting their Facebook accounts and
logging out and stuff like that because
they feel like their privacy has been
infringed upon or that kind of thing and
then there's and then there's another
response which is people who I've heard
saying like you know a lot of this in
from a lot of the stuff about what
information you share was in was it's
there granted it's in the fine print and
maybe that's something that's misleading
to people as far as knowing what you're
signing up for and this is also
something that's largely new you know in
the past five to ten years this is this
is all fairly recent so the ability for
they just for this to exist this global
social network that people can go and
post on and say whatever they want and
that kind of thing is all right now yeah
I feel like it's technology that that we
are sorta it's sort of in the infancy so
of course there's going to be people who
figure out ways to use it maliciously
right it's like a living breathing black
black mayor episode yeah yeah we're
cutting edge technology is now being
abused in yeah so obviously there's
there's there's a lot this is this is
the ongoing thing so we're gonna briefly
touch on it here obviously there's an
entire political side to this that we're
not going to delve into very much just
because we typically try to avoid that's
that type of thing on the show but
upshot for me right now is that if this
increases your awareness of what you
share online and good then good
everyone should be more understanding
that your connection to the Internet and
what you decide to post there and what
you talk about
is going to be used for marketing
purposes and whether that's a fairly
innocuous marketing purpose of like hey
here's a product you might want to buy
or whether it's a marketing purpose of
like here's some shadow government or
foreign country that's trying to
influence your decisions in some way
that you wouldn't naturally go for like
you know there's there's there's very
much yeah I think there's a lot more to
go into there that obviously we're not
gonna get into right now but yeah I
think it would be aware that what you're
sharing is important do you know like
yeah it's kinda like people don't
realize like going on to a website and
like creating a login and stuff and
being a user and being active in their
account it's kind of like going into
like a store that you know you're on
someone that you're on someone else's
property you're in someone else's
territory and they've got security
cameras they can film you walking into
their store they have full control over
that but the Internet's scary because
it's there's this level of the Tatra
where it's like well I'm still at home I
don't understand that I'm like actually
in somebody else's jurisdiction and you
don't know like if that website it has
security cameras just on you walking in
and walking out or or how deep that goes
like if you were using this
brick-and-mortar analogy like what if
they had cameras in the bathroom or in
the changing rooms you know like how
much data are they actually collecting
from you and people don't really have a
grasp of that because it's so intangible
to some degree there's a that is very
real there's a very significant
conversation going on right now about
facial recognition mmm with Facebook and
and it's there there's the online like
Facebook facial recognition of like I
uploaded a picture like oh it recognizes
that it's me and this other person who's
on my friends list so it can say like oh
here's the people in that picture tag
you know and then there's the official
recognition of like facial recognized in
Tina and other areas where it's like
wherever you walk there's cameras that
recognize your face and track wherever
you going all the time because
technology enables it now
and obviously there's some degree of
security to be gained from that but
there's also a lot of privacy to be
personal privacy to be given up and it's
a we know we don't really know what's
gonna happen in the future so we'll try
to keep an eye on it I guess I'm getting
scared so let's move on and talk about
something that's a little bit more
friendly the Windows 10 spring creators
update oh that's right that sounds a lot
more lighthearted ringing in Windows 10
Windows 10 is it's only kind of watching
you right so the Windows 10 spring
creators update this article over on PC
world by Mark hashman was written up
just sort of a collection of of things
that it has done and maybe you're aware
of this maybe you're not so I wanted to
quickly run down it and make you aware
of it for instance you now have one
click data deletion including the
diagnostic data that Microsoft has
collected on your device you can
actually just go and manually delete
that now app by app GPU management's and
so give you gives you a little bit more
control over your GPU as far as being
connected to the software and for
example if you're in a laptop or
something like that and maybe you have a
couple GPUs a little prior one and
discrete one to choose from you can it
can help help yourself out with some
power management a better game bar and
this is something that I have no idea if
anyone who watches this shows interested
in do you use the game bar I ignore all
the mic all the Windows 10 game stuff
but didn't even know it existed to be
honest I'm sure some people do it the
game bar sort of encourages you to
stream PC games via Windows mixer they
revamp the game bar to add a clock some
toggles to turn my camera off that kind
of thing I've never bothered to use this
I don't know if anyone does maybe it
maybe it's functional I don't know no
one's gonna use that change the fonts in
the Microsoft Store been waiting for
that one
this one's actually kind of useful on
demand bluetooth pairing via a pop-up
versus an awkward jiff image there or
whatever but um rather than having to go
into settings devices Bluetooth and
click the plus icon sip to pair stuff
there's a little pop-up that triggers a
pairing request so that's useful with
Windows 10 s you can now switch to
password list mode I haven't bothered to
test that myself so audio I can't this
is actually probably meant of all these
things is probably my favorite so you
have at volume and device preferences
you have a bit of an expanded UI here
with volume per app which is useful and
also input and output options here for
audio devices for anyone who does
streaming or runs multiple pieces of
software at the same time that you might
want one to play soft play audio and
that kind of thing hopefully this will
help you out as long as Windows updates
doesn't reset all of these yeah
parameters remember that I can update
after updates then we gave you more
things to reconfigure after every update
you're welcome but there you go some
better audio options autocorrect and
auto suggest for hardware keyboard okay
or what Auto keyboard the hardware
keyboard so just like a regular they
just mean a regular keyboard like
autocorrect when you're typing stuff
like in Word yeah weird the hard work
autosuggest functions for the hardware
keyboard that it does for the software
keyboard that pops up from tablets huh
so neither really unfortunately really
delivers so talk about their improved
eye tracking controls with eye control
because we all use that so for was the
MSI Toby - Toby anyone has an MSI toby
laptop super excited about that better
support for HDR displays Dimitri's gonna
have to redo his video
that's another 15 20 hours all right
you're my people I hate the people I
hate the people button go away people
button I don't care and even though that
is so and Cortana changes I don't care
about those either
all right that's that's all that's all
I'm done I'm done with that one so most
of those are crap in this tent spring
update complete junk I like the audio
one yeah that one's I don't know but who
was like you know what let's let's
change the font in Windows Store just
when you thought just when you thought
Windows Store couldn't get any worse
comics and they're giving you the
ability to change the font you I
understand that that you but but I know
but what who what fight which five users
were like you know Windows Store be much
better if I could change it to like
Times New Roman let's get some Calibri
in this bitch like why is that even a
thing why do we even need that option
why did it why are they spending time on
shit like that it's gonna revolutionize
Windows 10 there's so many other things
in Windows 10 that need fixing fucking
Windows Store font I like that new audio
interface the audio is fine Western
Digital maker of of many hard drives
diems WD has had several dabbling in the
SSD space and I've like so-so WD has
always been one of my favorite hard
drive manufacturers me too this goes
back to actually they're they're RMA
procedure because the drives that I've
used from WD they've by and large been
very reliable solid but of course you're
always gonna have hard drives to die
from time to time
WD RMA back in the day this is like mid
2000s like it was so good ever so you
take the the serial number you put it in
on their website it tells you exactly
how much time you have left for the RMA
you can set up the RMA you have like
three different options if you want to
put a credit card on file they can
immediately send your replacement so you
have no downtime or if you're willing to
wait you can you can send it and they
send it back and they did the thing for
shipping anyway
that among those several of things I
like WD so as the global storage
standard transitions from spinning
mechanical hard drives to flash based
I've been keeping an eye on WD and
Seagate as the largest hard drive
manufacturers to see what they do when
it comes to this transition WD today by
SanDisk about their W about Sanders's
using all their controllers and so
they're they're so sheeted now but also
means that they have access to NAND
flash manufacture
this is the latest product from Western
Digital
it's a WD black 3d and SSD the review
over here on Anandtech is by Ganesh and
Billy and did a great job and there's
there's all these different pages you
can go and look at their different
things that they tested and stuff like
that we're gonna keep this kind of high
level since this is just a live show but
first off it's important to note that
the same drive is going to be released
under two different brands so the
picture you can see right here there's a
SAM disc version and a WD version
underneath that sticker they're both the
exact same drive with the exact same
controller weird what might be kind of
confusing is they are reusing the name
at least on the WD side the WD black SSD
already exists and this is a new WD
black SSD the original one I do that had
a Marvel controller and 50 nanometer
planar TLC NAND flash memory
this new WD black slash SanDisk Extreme
Pro SSD is based on the same platform as
their business
om SSD with an SN 7 20s in 720 is a
model and that that was actually
launched earlier this year they features
64 layer BICS 3d NAND and Western
Digital z' own new SSD controller so
that's cool I like the WD is developing
there
drive controllers especially if it's
capable of this type of performance so
you can see it's available in three
different capacities 250 500 and turn in
50 gigs 500 gigs and 1 terabytes three
different models here the SanDisk
version is only gonna be available in
five hundred and one terabyte it's an m2
SSD nvme PCI Express gen3 by fork
connection to your motherboard and of
course that SanDisk 64 layer and then
flash it's got a bit of SK Hynix DRAM
therefore cache and sequential read and
write performance if you're looking at
the highest end one terabyte 30 400
megabytes per second read 20 800
megabytes per second right it's really
good
sticks with 3400 megabytes per second
reads for the 500 gig version drops at
3,000 for the 250 and you get a bit of
drop-off and they're sequential rate
performance there as well I apps 500k
for the one terabyte version 4 10 and
220 respectively for the 500 and 250 gig
and a few other relevant stats there as
well including total bytes written as
far as endurance goes well you might be
most interested in is the actual price
down here so look at this 250 gig high
ends nvme SSD it's dirty for two for 120
dollars 48 cents per gig Wow the 500 gig
one is $230 the 1 terabyte is 450
dollars
so solid it's pretty solid pricing there
considering that's in the review and
again I encourage you guys to read the
whole review if you want to get into
more the details about these drives
looking at the price per gig especially
comparing it to like the 960 pro from
Samsung which has been the fastest nvme
SSD for quite some time now you got to
pay about 64 cents per gig maybe 59
cents per gig if you're willing to spend
for the the one terabyte version of that
so that's like a third of the price and
pretty comparable performance yeah
very few disappointing results from the
WD black according to an an tech even
when it isn't tied for first or second
place as far as the benchmarks go it
well above the low-end nvme drives so
this has been sort of a dilemma that
I've had when it comes to recommending
people storage drives obviously a SATA
SSD will get you most of the
responsiveness and performance that
anyone would need kind of a base level
but it's like oh you've got that M that
2 slot on your board should you invest
in an nvme SSD and for the most part
it's like no it's really not worth
spending what you'd need to spend to get
like a 964 or something like that unless
you're doing a lot of heavy read writes
work or that kind of thing with the
drive yeah but having something that's
like a comparable you know hundred ish
dollar range for a solid operating
system drive that's pretty nice so
that's part of the reason I brought this
up puts it into like the same abased end
two categories yes in terms of pricing
yeah well I mean really sweet I haven't
looked just like today yesterday but you
can probably get a 250 gig SSD for 70 s
and $90 like a reasonable one yeah so a
bit more frame done to you you're paying
a bit more for the MDOT to but you're
getting the convenience of you don't
have to have an external drives that's
connects with a power cable and a SATA
cable to the board and it's just it's a
very solid like operating system drive
to just put in there like it's there
it's connected to the board just don't
worry about it add on other drives and
add on other SSDs for storage for steam
drive or that kind of one screw
installation instead of four yes so so
super convenient that way so there is
the WD black 3n + SSD also available as
the SanDisk Extreme Pro I didn't I
didn't look if you can like immediately
buy that right now but maybe I think you
can yeah you can just buy it yeah okay
all right let's move on so Lou certified
is next I'm gonna hold on hold on that's
word fate
there you go
certainly there it is okay cardfight is
next swordfight is a segment on awesome
part where where Kyle and I take
opposing sides of a controversial issue
we argue it we do attempt to sway your
opinion so there is a straw poll link in
this video's description you guys can
check that out
feel free to render your opinion by
voting on that straw poll or you can
wait and listen to what Kyle and I have
to say sure and perhaps what we say will
affect what you think since we are
influencers I learned this weekend at
PAX East that I am an influencer now and
not a tech reviewer oh yeah you know
that's my fates been sealed guys I'm
sorry
I'm sorry I let you down you can now
refer it refer to me as influencer bit
wit okay single-tier now that that's
been cleared up this argument we're
about to have his base on this article
from Gizmodo G's moto about teen
monitoring apps now Kyle we're slightly
older right we're not we're not young
men anymore speak for yourself well I
know I'm although I'm older than you but
I'm trying to pretend like I am slightly
younger by making you feel slightly
older no I am pretty old too right so
we're old ends you know we're just as
like to be to be dads now as we are to
be like young dudes in our 20s or
whatever right dad jokes already so
eventually you know potentially might
have children and obviously anyone who
has kids in this day and age is gonna
face some difficult decisions when it
comes to their kids and giving them
access to the Internet
now this article from Gizmodo is about
teen monitoring apps and the article
concludes that they don't work and they
just make teens hate their parents and I
think everyone saw that coming
yeah there's a there's a study
referenced in here somewhere
this
some references to research and that
kind of thing obviously what we don't
care anything about any of that we just
care about our feelings how do we feel
about this so we're gonna argue here
about the straw poll question this has
been linked in chat if you guys wanna
answer should just should this be a
thing or not because like I try to view
it from the perspective of the of you
know if if if my parents were using a
monitoring app on me or if I was to use
a monitoring app on on my kids it's very
confusing it's attitude basically I mean
those two perspectives are literally at
extreme opposites of the spectrum I know
and yet and yet we must straddle that we
must straddle right on top of it and and
view it from both sides so should
parents monitor apps on the kids
smartphones and computers
should this be a thing I mean maybe
maybe there's budding parents out there
who are gonna listen to this and get
some some real good advice the rearing
of their children as they attempt to
come to mould their young breed like I
like the third option that's my favorite
part of strawpoll yeah making that a
certified actually they kept coming up
with the third the anti answer yeah
exactly
all right and so thank you for posting
the lincoln and chat as well cell
processing our trusty moderator he does
a great job all right what do you what
do you think cal which side side of this
argument you're gonna I'm gonna hit your
horse to well after I just saw Steve
from gamers Nexus post in our YouTube
chat that he actually planted monitoring
apps on me during the PAX East panel
that we were both on this weekend I'm
gonna have to argue no do not monitor
the children or your fellow YouTube
influencers because at the end of the
day
at the other day the more you encroach
on their freedom and try to tell them
how to live their lives the more they're
going to push away and so parents wonder
why they have this terrible relationship
with their kids it's because they're
forcefully trying to control them and
parents think they parents are addicted
to control especially with their kids
because it's the only thing they have
they literally gave up their entire
lives for these children and they feel
like they kind of have the right to
control them to control every aspect of
their life but really that's poor
parenting at the end of the day because
when you get to be the age of 18 at
least in America you become an adult and
you have the freedom to do whatever the
fuck you want within reason within the
law and you don't have someone
monitoring you so if it's your so it's
technically your your due diligence and
responsibility of as a parent to prep
your child for freedom to prep your
child to know how to behave and how to
live without someone surveilling them
24/7 and it's it creates a a toxic
environment between parent and child and
I do not stand for it because you know
it's it doesn't work it doesn't work for
anyone even if you successfully control
your child when they turn 18 they're not
gonna know they're either I'm not gonna
know how to behave without some sort of
guidance right like like little be
terrible at Skyrim because it's just too
it's just too lacy fair and to open
world or they're they're gonna just
conform exactly to every single rule
that they can find and adhere to those
rules and they'll feel trapped and
stressed and anxious for the rest of
their lives so at the end of the day
don't be like Steve from gamers Nexus
and Steve if you're still watching don't
just just did you stop monitoring me
because otherwise I'm gonna like
I'm just gonna like pull out my dick
later tonight when you least expect it
and you're gonna just see my dick and
that's what you get you spying asshole
so go to hell
quick aside that's the best way to
prevent the FBI from spying on you and
the cameras like in your laptop and your
your cell phone just constantly show
doubt just constantly do video of your
taint on those devices Paul gets it why
can't you Steve so I gotta do why can't
you okay
obviously Kyle's wrong he almost always
is unless he's agreeing with me so what
were you arguing for there you said yes
you don't even know what side you're on
get a grip Paul no you said no you said
no we shouldn't monitor our kids let me
explain why you're wrong cow now first
off just just to be clear I understand I
know where people come from when they
have this fear of monitoring and
surveillance and all that kind of thing
but you know what that's all part of
this past right that's a that's a 20th
century dilemma that people really need
to get over because we're in the
Information Age we're in the future and
this type of thing is inevitable but
really if we embrace it if we embrace
the ability of technology to track our
comings and goings are our wants and our
desires and ends you know our
fingerprints our retina scans and
everything we will be happier this is
the the a I write AI is going to usher
in a future of peace and contentment for
everyone and it's going to start with
the constant monitoring if everyone in
the world in order to you know establish
the big data analytics for behavioral
patterns and that kind of thing that way
they can establish where it's properly
administer the propaganda in order to
subdue you know our subconscious need to
rise up and over
throw the people who are trying to
suppress us it's also gonna help them to
establish where they should distribute
the soma right that's what they usually
you know that usually it's distributed
in a gaseous form you inhale that you
feel just fine
don't worry about so all this comes back
of course to monitoring our kids because
once we agree to that once we sign into
that application we agree to that but
check the checkbox find print there it's
probably going to be monitoring us as
well it's gonna be monitoring everyone
and we just need to submit given relax
let the AI make the decisions and just
go for it and we're it's gonna be a just
a bright and pleasant future I think
well I was gonna vote for you for
president Paul but after that speech I
don't know how I feel I'm sure you were
I'm sure you were rooting for the the
cops to arrest Tom Cruise in Minority
Report if if my soma vapor emitters were
installed you would you would agree with
me very quickly I think okay well you
are building a tesla powerwall so if
you're already building you're already
on your way if I was fancy I would build
it myself there's videos on there about
people who build them themselves see
what why the hell why oh the hell at
your building you're right it's you
should be monitoring
Ted Christie okay it's a DIY builder all
right let's see what everyone thinks
about this I'm curious all right to know
your response I win
let's check results I don't know do that
no I don't know people agree with you
Kyle
kids should be kids should be able to
explore their own the world and find out
it make decisions they should be able to
make this make mistakes because that's
how you learn that's how you learn for
the future of your life only 13% of
people watching our show have their
parents currently monitoring them so I
lose but that you know what I meant to I
meant to lose
steve says you're trekking my brain
thoughts is that true
I'm track I'm tracking Steve's mind
brain brain Kyle
clearly not it's confused I'm confused
if I feel safe again Thank You Nina I
feel like reinstalling confidence in I
feel like right now though right now if
I can if I can just work we're moving
towards the latter half of my half of
the show but some recommended reading
right now in 1984 I was thinking about
that book well we were discussing this
brave new world Animal Farm Animal Farm
gonna be a good one too ooh but my god
read books read I need to read more
books I've really dropped off with that
okay we're we're we're rounding out my
half of the show and we're actually
gonna do some mail time right now add a
couple mail things to open why not
female time you misogynistic bastard
shut up
I knew that did changing
mail time there we go all right in the
meantime whilst I open these packages
Kyle maybe can start answering questions
sir yes sir let's do it

Scott Dilbeck is the first one to donate
in every show he is so congrats top of
that you are it's got a proactive fam
thank you very much
automatic Omak automatic Matt may be the
second person to donate to every show
automatic dollars past CCNA - now I've

next week congratulations Matt I'm glad
your testing went well and that you
passed I'm glad we both believe in you

Polly we have first package hears from
deke Cooley this is from Texas he said
hello Paul football as well your YouTube
channel has been an inspiration to me
and built my first PC about a year ago
also love you and Kyle an awesome
hardware Thank You mr. Cooley sweet we
love you too I'm sending you an old I
566 hundred K was my backup to my i7
7700 case so he had an a 6600 K I have
no upgraded to a Z 370 and an 80 600 K
the processor works fine hope you can
get some use out of it thanks David
Cooley hey that's actually you know a
pretty really decent this is easy 600 K
which is a solid
oh yeah solid processor oh yeah you want
to upgrade so that for four years
let me say two things first off David
thank you I'm honored and touched he's I
could just give you like 300 old a
second for anyone who's inspired by
David Cooley I really I don't need more

like a model so I don't know I feel like
you should open it up cuz we don't

assembling so you do have to assemble

we've got sleepy 21 $20 thank you very
much sir sup pollen cow I'm looking to
set up my audio system currently have a
logitech 2.1 system my budget is $1,500
what would you guys recommend I love
music with lots of bass if that helps
I like music with lots of bass too
sleepy honestly there are so many good
monitors out there different desktop
speakers that you could that you could
snatch up I don't work with a lot of
those I haven't reviewed many speaker
systems to be honest but like for me
you're either looking at some really
high-end monitors like desk monitors
that you'd use his budget is 1,500 so so
like some yes monitors because they're
somewhat or you could get like a
receiver with an amplifier and a full
5.1 or 7.1 surround system for that much
- which would be more for like listening
in the in the living rooms that you
could also connect it up to home theater
or something like that right beyond that
I don't have any any specific
recommendations if anyone in Chad has
recommendation for a great audio system
for around $1500 blow up chat and so
that sleep you can see it and because
you guys probably have more good
recommendations that we do
thank you very much sleepy hope it works
out for you insert meme here donated $5
hi I'm thinking about grating my PC I
have a Strix is e - 7 th and a 1070 TI
in mind any recommendations if you have
a 1070 TI man I can't really see why you
would need to upgrade that too far to go
from there unless unless you're trying
to do 4k and maybe triple 4k or
something like that then you would need
a 1080i maybe three of the two of them
or two uh-huh or two of them but yeah
ten seven yeah if everything's working
fine this is what I tell everyone if
everything's working fine and you're not
getting taken out of the game every 10
minutes because of some weird glitch or
drop the framerate then just stick with
what you have that sounds like pretty
solid setup okay what you got I think
there's
beer pop possibly this one felt like
there was liquid and this is from common
ground distribution ooh
in North Carolina so I don't know what
that means nor care or do they call it
nor care like we call it SoCal
nor care nor care North Carolina you nor
care North care in nor care
this is a six-pack do they call it North
care where you're from Steve if you're
still thankin tell us tell us via are
they like yo what up in nor care we're
down in South care this so care appears
to be the best packaging for a six-pack
this isn't better all right I think this
is a six-pack six-pack of what it's a
mate mix and match no letter I don't I
didn't see anything see anything all
right well Jana and Roush wire tenkan a
deer's hey guys any recommendations for
a small PC case that fits in the
backpack small duffle bag that will
become an htpc until that silverstone
Nast cases out been looking at liam lean
pc o v sx check out the no 202 is pretty
compact but you need a fairly large
backpack to fit that in if you want
something smaller so check out some of
the Dan cases the a for SFX
that is a really tiny case that also
fits into screen GPU I would look there
first the the entrance one is a
fantastic choice for something super
portable that would fit in a backpack
sg0 5 from silverstone is also really
compact I would check out those three
yep everyone in chat is validating that
the damn case is is a good option what
do we got here alright so this is a mix
and match from the Ingalls and advantage
SIG's import micro brew beer food so it
looks like we have three different beers
two of each green
man green man dry hopped Pale Ale the
Rambler alright cool
this is from Asheville North Carolina
this is from Highland Brewing Company in
Asheville North Carolina this is the st.
Teresa's Pale Ale golden Pale Ale grease
the twice with Cascade hops a nice
really nice job on wrapping and
packaging this yeah my god with a
six-pack I mean you actually bubble
wrapped each bottle individually it's
probably the best packaging that I've
ever seen from anyone sending us beer so
kudos to you on that you know you're
doing years before his Gaelic tale
Gaelic Gaelic ale you look first brewed
in 1994 delicious alright so well thank
you it was five one that I'm still not
positive who sent this because I don't
know if there's any and he letter
couldn't find any note or anything like
no no but thank you to whoever sent this
beer
yeah old Rob will drink it soon its next
weaker than its entirety right next
accelerating rate Richmond thanks
accelerant max acceleration got it $10
finally cut you live you inspired and
taught me to do my first builds to rise
in three pcs if you didn't know what
would you think about cooler included
with the 2700 X will be on Pitt my PC
soon what would you think about the
cooler included with the 2700 X I don't
know what you mean by that
um it might be the Wraith max or the
Wraith spire I don't know it might not
be any cooler because it's a hot it's
the flagship CPU so just like they did
just like AMD did with rise in first gen
there were no coolers included with the
higher-end CPUs because AMD just assumed
that users buying those chips would be
installing their own CPU coolers
aftermarket coolers that had better TDP
handling that could cool those chips
more effectively but I'm a huge fan of
the of the Wraith series of coolers the
stock coolers from AMD are
light years ahead of anything Intel's
put out in that class so so um what he's
probably talking about is is this here
that's a wreath max right there the
right max is great it's quiet
has RGB fuck yeah and although it does
have the clear heal conundrum that Paul
and I constantly disapprove of on the
show um but you know as long as it's
cool and quiet those are the two most
important things and it's free so the
clear he'll issue is is really a
non-issue if they're gonna give it to
you on the house so i recused myself you
reduce your accuser thank you very much
max acceleration bazinga X $10 Paul
should monitor Kyle he really needs
monitoring yes I do but fortunately for

from from goddamn what the hell's Deus
Ex and shit you freaking arm and if
you're happy if you were to have to
