doubleheader this time focusing on the
graphics cards Navi has finally arrived
with AMD launching two mid-range cards
with GPUs based on seven nanometer
process technology the Radeon rx 5700
and the 5700 X T oh and if you're
looking for Rison 3000 series CPU
coverage I posted that video already
earlier today so link is in the
description this past week has been
dramatic because Nvidia tried to
undercut AMD's Navi launch by dropping
their archi X 20 series super cards only
five days ago Wow
is that really just five days ago it
seems like a lifetime but AMD had one
last trick up their sleeve and it was a
last-minute price drop
if this tweet from Radeon technologies
group boss Scott Kirkland is to be
believed this has been their plan all
along but what we now have are reduced
launch prices with the rx 5700 now going
for three hundred and fifty dollars
instead of the originally planned to 380
bucks and the 5700 XT going for four
hundred dollars instead of four hundred
and fifty to sum up these new 7
nanometre graphics cards though they are
based on AMD's new rDNA architecture
which introduces major changes to the
underlying GPU design compared to the
previous GCN architecture and they've
switched from HBM memory to G DDR 6
while also improving memory bandwidth to
448 gigabytes per second
the result is faster more power
efficient cards that run much higher
frequencies and former Radeon offerings
they are also the first PCI Express 4.0
GPS although honestly the increased bus
bandwidth won't necessarily help
performance in a significant way the two
models launching today are referenced
designs from AMD and they do look pretty
cool although the XT kind of seems to be
sucking in its gut a little bit there
all the time
both require six pin and eight pin power
connectors and the Radeon rx 5700 is
rated at 185 watts of total board power
while the Radeon rx 5700 XT is rated at
225 watts
these are blower style coolers which
have their use as they eject most of the
hot air from the card out the back of
your case but we expect to see a
third-party designs very soon that
should provide better cooling and
potentially higher sustains clock speeds
speaking of clock speeds let's start our
test results with some speed power draw
and thermal numbers the 5,700 has a base
clock of 14 65 and a game clock of 1625
the
AMD's new terminology for what they
think the card will run at under load at
minimum and they say it could probably
go up from there ambi also lists a peak
clock but rather than show that I've
just replaced it with what I saw as my
sustained clock speed numbers and the rx
5700 ran at about 16 50 megahertz once
thermals leveled out 5700 XT has a base
of 1605 and a boost of 1755 and it
pushed up past 1900 megahertz initially
before settling down to just over 1800
sustained the powered round numbers are
good news for na'vi as well with both
peak and average power draw results for
the 50 750 700 xt matching or beating
the nvidia competition this is a great
improvement on previous offerings from
the Radeon team only the Archie X 2060
draws less power overall but it also
underperformed in the benchmarks as you
will see in just a moment finally for
temperatures the RT X cards ran cooler
across the board in the low 70s versus
the 76 and 84 degrees C temperatures
that d50 750 700 XT got up too but bear
in mind here that for these cards we're
looking at dual fan open cooler designs
that NVIDIA has made in their founders
Edition whereas AMD is still using
blower coolers and we'll probably see
improved versions of them when
third-party partners make custom
variants and now let's get into some
real benchmarks but first a quick look
at my testbed which is based on the as
Roxy 390 Taichi ultimate motherboard and
an Intel Core i $9.99 hundred k cpu
running at 4.8 gigahertz across all
cores it is cooled by the new Noctua Nhu
12 8-hour cooler the memory is a kid of
g co royal RGB at 30 600 megahertz casa
latency 16 and we're running Windows 10
version 1903 which is installed on a 512
K exam son 970 pro m2 nvme SSD the
system is powered by an EVGA supernova
g3 750 watt power supply and we are
using an open testbed not a case also
that I mentioned that I benchmarked to
10 GPUs for this video 5 from Nvidia and
5 from AMD including the Vega 56 and 64
and the Radeon seven C's previous gen
Radeon GPUs are on the more expensive
side and they are being phased out but
they do provide a good point of
comparison to show how far AMD has come
with these new cards that said let's get
into the benchmarks we're starting off
here with 3d mark there firestrike ultra
test
which runs at 4k Ultra 3840 by 2160 it's
a DirectX 11 test and I have sorted all
these benchmarks this is a test where
the Radeon seven per forms really really
well but bear in mind that will not
continue to be the case through the rest
of the test the 5700 xt is just beating
out the RT x 2070 super here and the RX
5700 is significantly better than vega
56 from last generation and it's coming
in just shy of the RT x 2060 super here
you can also see why nvidia decided that
they needed to update the RT x 2060 to
compete with these new navi cards
moving on to 3d mark x by extreme the
DirectX 12 ultra 4k test here the Radeon
7 has dropped down to a more reasonable
score we can see the 5700 XT coming in
just shy of the RT X 2060 Super once
again and the 5700 which is beating at
the Vegas 64 and the Archie X 2060 next
is 3d mark VR mark Blue Room which is a
virtual reality test for those of you
who are into VR just to give you an idea
of performance here the RT X cards
actually performed very well here taking
the top four spots followed up by the
Radeon 7 and then the 5700 XT coming in
just behind them not necessarily the
best showing here for the Radeon cards
as they are taking up five of the bottom
six spots next we have ashes of the
singularity ashes of the benchmark as it
is often known running at 4k 3840 by
2160 and i'm running all these tests at
4k then 1440 and then 1080 here at 4k
though we can see the arc TX 2080 coming
out on top
2070 super following it up and then the
5700 xt not quite matching the RT x 2070
but it does beat out the Radeon seven in
this test meanwhile the rx 5700 is
beating the Vegas 64 but not quite
matching the RT X 2060 super moving over
to 1440 and this is the resolution that
AMD is aiming the 50 750 700 XT at and
the 5700 XT is performing better here
just barely edging out the RT X 2070 and
coming in in spot number 3 RT X 2070
super is beating it but bear in mind
that card costs a hundred more dollars
meanwhile the rx 5700 is coming in just
shy of the 2060 super and again beating
the Vegas 64 finally here at 1080 we
have a similar breakdown with D 5700 XT
coming in third just behind the 2070
super the
x57 just behind the 2060 super and again
just barely beating out the vegas 64
next we have shadow of the Tomb Raider
running at 4k 3840 by 2160 and the 5700
XT is not quite able to meet the 2070
super in this one but it does beat the
2070 once again so there's yet further
evidence of why Nvidia decided to follow
up the RT X 2070 with the 2070 super
meanwhile the 5700 performing very well
here beating not just the Vegas 64 but
also the 2060 super that trend continues
at 2560 by 1440 5700 got eighty eight
point two frames per second compared to
the 2060 supers eighty six point seven
meanwhile the 5700 XT once again beats
the 2070 once again comes in just shy of
the 2070 super but only by a few frames
per second
only here shadow of the Tomb Raider in
1920 by 1080 the top four cards are all
pretty neck-and-neck here although we
are seeing better 1% low numbers for the
Radeon cards versus the RT X cards the
XD handily beats to 2070 and the 5,700
is once again coming in ahead of the 20
60 super-bright of 5 at 4k 3840 by 2160
still a very popular game although it is
a little bit on the older side its
DirectX 11 and AMD cards typically don't
do the best in GTA 5 the 5700 XT here is
coming in just below the 2060 super
followed up by the 5700 both of them are
still beating out the RT X 2060 but you
do get better performance from both the
RT X 2070 and the RT X 2070 super at
this resolution at 1440 supposedly the
sweet spot for the 5700 cards we're not
quite meeting the 2060 super yet again
although it is coming in ahead of the
Archie X 2060 and you can see some
pretty nice gains from last generation
if you compare the Vega 56 and Vega 64
numbers finally we have GTA 5 at 1920 by
1080 the 5700 XT jumps up in the charts
here to fourth place
beating out to 2070 the RX 5700 is still
coming in shy of the 2060 super but
beating the 2060
next up we have battlefield 5 @ 4k 3840
by 2160 and here the 5700 XT and the
5700 and the Radeon 7 for that matter
are actually showing poorer 1% low
performance compared to the RT X
variants so that might be something to
keep in mind 5700 he does beat out the
2070 super here and the 5700 is beating
not just the
60 super but also the r-tx 2070 unless
you look at 1% Lowe's moving over to
2560 by 1440 again the 1% lows are not
looking that great for the radians cards
here but the 5700 XT is actually beating
the 2080 when it comes to maximum
performance so here is probably a good
example of the sweetspot 1440 resolution
and the 5,700 cards doing well the
standard 5,700 is also beating the r-tx
2070 and the Vegas 64 here finally
here's battlefield 5 at 1080 and then
once again we had the 5700 stepping up
and beating not just the r-tx 2070 but
also the r-tx 2070 super not bad for a
$350 card compared to a $500 card here's
overwatch at 4k 3840 by 2160 this is a
game that I actually kind of know how to
play oh that's that's somewhat besides
the point when it comes to benchmark
numbers here the 5700 XT is beating the
Radeon 7 on the RT X 2070 although
coming in shy of the 2070 super raid on
5700 years once again outperforming the
RT X 2060 super if we move over to 1440
we have the RT X 2080 on top followed by
the RT X 2070 super and then the rx 5700
XT meanwhile the rx 5700 is down there
in sixth place just above the RT X 2060
super once again here's overwatch at
1080 the 5700 XT is coming in third here
beating the 2070 but not the 2070 super
and the RX 5700 is just shy of the 2060
super in this one and handily beats the
RT X 2060 my last test is Metro Exodus
DirectX 12 running 4k 3840 by 2160 here
the RT x 2080 is definitely the fastest
in this lineup followed by the Radeon 7
and the Vegas 64 Vega 64 actually
performing quite well here followed by
the 2070 super and then the 5700 XT
meanwhile the 5700 is once again slotted
in between the RT X 2070 and the 2060
super moving out of 1440 and the 5700 XT
here is still doing quite well although
it's not quite meeting the 2070 super
unless you look at the 1% low numbers
and then the rx 5,700 once again beating
the 2060 super not quite beating the RT
x 2070 and a final test here Metro
Exodus at 1080 and the 2080s on top 5700
XT is in fourth place just above the
2070 5700 is in
sixth place just above the 2060 super I
wanted to show you guys some overall
metrics so here's a performance
comparison of pretty much all the cards
I tested compared to the Archie X 2060
so if you're looking at the RT X 2060 as
a zero point this is the relative
performance at 4k 2560 by 1440 and 1920
by 1080 of all the different cards that
I tested I did sort these by performance
so at 4k we can see the RX 5700 XT
performs about thirty point five percent
better than the RT X 2060
meanwhile the 5,700 is about seventeen
point one percent faster at 1440 the
5700 XT moves up a notch in the rankings
twenty-eight point three five percent
better than on RT X 2060 meanwhile the
rx 5,700 is about fifteen point five
percent faster then finally at 1080 the
rx 5700 XT is a little over 30% faster
and the rx 5700 is about seventeen point
five percent faster finally here's a
performance comparison with the prices
in there - and I have removed some of
the cards here just to make it a simpler
graph so we're looking at the cards that
are going to be available
I removed the standard RT X 2070 and
2080 as well as the older AMD cards so
we can just look at the RT X 2060 at the
bottom which is a hundred percent of
performance for 350 bucks if you compare
that to the rx 5,700 we're looking at
between 15 and 17 percent better
performance for the same price so it
seems like it's pretty much a no-brainer
there for which card you should go for
compare the 5700 XT at $400 to the 2060
super and we're again looking at about a
10 to 15 percent performance bump
comparatively for the same price the
2070 super is obviously the winner here
going between thirty and forty percent
faster compared to the RT X 2060 but it
is also the most expensive card at $500
so I must say that I am very happy to be
closing out this video because this week
has been very intense with all of the
benchmarking I was very complimentary of
AMD's work with Rison 3000 on the CPU
side and I am similarly chuffed with
these new Navi cards although it's not
quite the blow out that AMD served Intel
the last-minute price changes were
affected though and in particular if you
have 350 bucks to spend the Radeon RX
5700 would be the way to go unless
you're really really really into ray
tracing which would be ok but in my
opinion
it's not a reason to go with the 2060
over the 5700 in a similar fashion the
5700 XT now looks very good at $400
compared to the 2060 super and would get
the recommendation at that $400 price
I'm hoping that Nvidia might be
considering a price drop on the r-tx
2070 super to give it some better
competition although the new navi cards
provides some very respectable new
options in the mid-range GPU market
before they even launched they proved
that this new competition is giving us
more performance for less money in the
form of Nvidia super launch and I'm very
happy that the efficiency is there too I
will be looking forward to third-party
designs when they start coming to market
and I think that's going to be a good
spot to end this video so hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed it and let me
know in the comment section down below
what other uses you'd like to see me put
these Navi cards - I don't see I'm going
to build or more testing just just let
me know in the comment section thank you
so much for watching this video though
guys I'm gonna go get some sleep we'll
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
