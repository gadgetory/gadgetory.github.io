hey guys welcome to pulsar where today's
video is gonna be primarily an update to
my ongoing epic water-cooled PC build
because I'm beginning a lot of questions
asking about that but since I have
actually a lot of things to do today and
my real goal is to by God get things
done I'm gonna take you along for the
ride so I have a time-lapse going so I
can kind of show you guys what all I'm
doing I am going to be doing some first
steps on my new water cooling builds so
I'm going to be taking apart my test bed
to get to 59 60 X out of there I'm gonna
be doing my first build putting
everything together I want to install
Windows and I want to get some
benchmarks done for the gigabyte geforce
gtx 980 g1 gaming epic cards that I have
because I want to test these first as is
before I do all the water coins so I can
see what the difference is from step a
step B it's not a lot to do but first an
update on my epic water-cooled system
one is the ek water cooling equipment is
on its way
that's all been ordered so really happy
about that I'll do an unboxing and an
overview of all that equipment as soon
as it arrives to is that I'm working on
a mod for the define R 5 side panel I
didn't mention that in the first video
but I am planning on doing a window
right there I want to do tempered glass
so working on that as well still gotta
have some details to get ironed out
there it is coming along sorry it's kind
of slow moving but I didn't want to
document the whole thing so I'll be
doing more updates stay tuned for those
don't forget to subscribe to the channel
and don't forget to like this video as
well as I move into things oh and one
other thing
and here it is everyone the build for
now I'm sorry this isn't very glamorous
I don't I don't even have proper
lighting going on right now but I wanted
to show you the build thus far so
basically what I got going on the
fractal Kelvin t12 was right up there
it's been doing a fantastic job thus far
the basic system is installed I took out
this cage I have to figure out what I'm
gonna do with this cage down on the
lower right I might need to shift it to
the right for the radiators go in and up
here
I have ordered the tempered glass piece
that's going to be going into the side
panel mod that's coming up - I have
Windows installed on the 850 Evo Windows
8.1 I did a fresh install because I
wanted everything to be nice and fresh
the vector is here just transferring
some games for now but we also have the
the power supply installed so that's
been doing a great job it's pretty quiet
for the most part and everything's
coming together
I do the software setup now though so
with Windows 8.1 installed I have just
finished running my first benchmark
which is 3d mark just firestrike
standard I scored just shy of 13,000
which is very nice this is just with the
GP running its stock GPU core clock goes
all the way up to 13 92 when I have it
just just running straight out of the
box under load so that was pretty cool
CPU temperature I did get the CPU
overclock the same one that I had going
on the EVGA x99 classified dialed in
here so it's running at 4.5 although
it's not running at 4.5 right now at 1.2
volts or just a little bit over 1.2
volts and under load although it wasn't
too much load it was hitting about looks
like 60 to 70 at the at the hottest core
so not bad there either I'm pretty happy
with everything I wish I could show you
guys more benchmark results that was
kind of my goal but honestly I need to
post a video and since this is sort of a
build in progress log this is this is
gonna be it for today so don't forget to
like this video don't forget to
subscribe don't forget to stay tuned for
more videos like this one oh and go to
my store and buy a shirt maybe that'd be
cool too but thanks for watching
everyone we'll see you all in the next
