modders all over the world who have
built some amazing systems like this
Darkseid themed case by George
priscilla's showcasing the spacious
internals in the define s or metallic
acid a mini ITX system by Justin Olson
featuring a white black and red color
scheme and a super clean layout in they
define nano s there are a ton more
awesome build like these on fractal
designs modding series page so check it
out via the sponsor link in this video's
description and get inspired for your
next project absolute it I'm so
conflicted right now guys I have two big
old packages that just showed up from
AMD and I can't find my Spyderco kind of
displayed I'm gonna have to stick with
my standard box opener here but here it
is a huge crazy unboxing I'm assuming
this must be thread Ripper you guys
probably already know because I'm
probably gonna put it in the title but
enjoy and live vicariously through me as
I gorge myself on the unboxing of really
crazy high-end computer parts here goes
it's really heavy just trying to do one
at a time ok so full disclosure I sort
of open these already 6 showed up
yesterday and I couldn't wait that long
but I didn't open the stuff inside I
just had to make sure that it was what I
was expecting
alright so first off we have what
appears to be a pelican case alright so
this is a big old Pelican case on the
front right here it says Andy rising
thread ripper it has a plaque with my
name on it which is which is right there
too so this does appear to be
personalized some extent that's pretty
cool and that's the look so confess and
see reveal the mysteries that lies
inside alright oh there it is and as you
can maybe tell from the top-down view we
got thread Ripper it looks like not just
one thread Ripper but two thread rippers
as well as this
this thing right here which is a little
hold on let's pop
so first Wow
so this is an acrylic presentation piece
it says rising thread river unlocked
unrestrained uncompromising says 2017
and then the thread Ripper CPU itself
it's in that's in there and it is
non-functional because at least that's
what it said in the packing list that
they gave me but it says Andy read/write
and thread representative paul Heimlich
forty of 250 so I have a limited edition
thread Ripper thing here which I don't
know where the other 249 of them are but
that's pretty freakin sweet so inside we
have a so it looks like this guy did get
bang around at shipping just a little
bit there's some foam protecting it but
there's clearly at the very top here
there's like a little piece with the
connection point that's supposed to
attach to the top which I think musta
gotten busted up and shipping how so
that and shipping somehow is what I
should say so that's that's unfortunate
there but inside our to rise insider for
retail packages this is a horizon
threader for 1950 x-play full-on 16 432
thread version of a license ID this is
especially custom design Cape with
license ID and then second up we have
the resin through preferred 1920 X 12
core 24 thread version and both of them
in there cool looking new retail boxes
now inside the actual packaging there's
actually two rings in there that it's
just I think what might have happened
was it got button banger and shipping
this little sensor right here at the top
and when that is connected or not when
it's disconnected yeah so when it's
disconnected the lights off so this was
actually built so that when when you
open the case app that's supposed to to
touch and then the lights supposed to
show up and shine through the thread
Ripper boxes unfortunately maybe because
it was on during shipping
thanks beginning like bumped around or
something maybe the battery has died
I'll see if I can figure that out but I
do think this that's all looking
it does appear to be all that we have
inside this Rita is inside this box part
from more information about the Pelican
cases hey it's a Pelican case
- that's pretty sweet those in cases are
nice get box - going up here and again
we have well no Pelican case in here but
again we have risin presentation going
on
AMD did did some extra work on this here
they have this insert that goes in there
with more unlocked unrestrained
uncompromising alright so much of empty
a and B boxes just use spacers
all right memory motherboard
cooler power supply no no things are
things okay okay so apart from this
little plexi thing which just makes fun
noises okay that's fun
Wow that apart from that we have the RG
Venus extreme motherboard X 399 socket
TR 4 motherboard from Asus that's a
beefy board that's like one of the
highest end ones it's available at
launch of course we got a couple memory
kits these are from g.skill the Trident
the RGB kits I have worked with these
before these are 3,200 speed cast
latency 14 for total 6 8 gigs each we
have the thermal take tough power brand
1200 watt power supply because you got
to have power and then we have the
thermal take flow ring 360 which is a
360 millimetre radiator closed loop all
in one liquid cooler and it does have
the standard a stick mounting solution
as far as the CPU pump block which means
that it will work with the bracket 4 TR
4 it's included with the rising
processors and you know there's supposed
to be an SSD in there according to the
packing list - there was supposed to be
a 960 Pro but I don't see it at all this
stuff in front of me I can't be
disappointed
there's no 960 CRO SSD I guess alright
let's so since I don't want this video
to take too long I'm going to skip most
of the other stuff as far as taking it
out of the box most of that stuff is
already out to some extent or another so
I'm going to focus on the motherboard
and then the processors - we'll start
with the ROG zenith extreme motherboard
and we'll just do a quick unboxing here
I was able to take a look at this board
for the very first time at
protects this year although this should
obviously be the actual retail shipping
version and not sure if there were any
last-minute changes made between the one
that they had on display at context and
this one here but then if there are I
probably won't be able to tell you what
they are but other than the motherboard
you're getting a set of stickers because
gamers love stickers and then we also
have wow just a ton of accessories and
again I'm not going to go over all these
but we got stuff like Wi-Fi antenna here
as well as a bunch of SATA cables other
cables for connecting up various various
peripheral SLI bridges going all the way
to four-way is that little thing at all
and then we also have this guy here
which I will show you both oh wait we
are testing this is a I believe this is
a 10 gigabit ethernet card if I'm not
mistaken
yeah our G area in 10 G so it comes with
a same unit you connect card so a couple
of cool accessories just to highlight
really quickly the ROG Aryan 10g
ethernet card so that's cool and gig
Ethernet in the Box just takes up a
little PCIe like it need to buy for slot
and then this is Adam dot 2 slot this is
a unique thing that Asus vid with the
highest end range of motherboards that
they've been working on on our G series
the basic idea is that when you have an
MDOT to drive like especially really
fast than V I mean one if you have a
certain areas of the board it can get
very hot so asus decided to take a dim
interphase dual inline memory module
same as your you know your ddr4 and
basically make a riser card out of it so
that flops in over here in 10.2 and then
it has mounting points on the top of it
four to one on either side MDOT to nvme
SSDs going all the way up to 22 10 at
length on either side so that provides
you with the better location for a
couple
MDOT to SSDs beyond that this board is
just absolutely beastly as far as looks
like it's packed with stuff it ei TX
form-factor so it's a little bit wide
but it's got all the modern stuff that
you'd want on a motherboard like got a
USB 3.1 front panel header right there
that Asus is we're working on and we're
actually starting to see cases with
those looks like massive power delivery
dual pin power connectors of course
can't see what's underneath there as far
as actual modules going in there but I'm
sure it's did a good job they typically
do and then we've got like some
supplemental power for the PCIe slots
down there if you are going for a bunch
of graphics cards in a configuration or
something like that then it says our GB
support and it's also got a fixed IO
shield on the back there so the i/o
shield is you can never you can never
forget it I believe in these plastic on
it for now suit up we'll we'll come back
to that I'm sure in the future and then
that TR for second I get to install my
first Red River into a pr4 socket very
soon and I'm looking forward to that and
now I should unbox one of these thread
prefers what do you what do you guys say
this is again brand new packaging
completely new design from AMD and I
think it's something that is fairly
unique looking definitely I mean I
haven't gotten excited about packaging
for a CPU in a while
granted you know it's kind of a silly
thing to get excited about but you know
the unboxing experience you guys are
watching an unboxing video right now so
I don't complain to me but here's how
you open it it's got a rip here
indicated right on the side right there
so ripped
sticking with dread regime peel that up
that will break the seal and now my
package has been open get rid of that
and then that's just some closed cell
foam as far as the actual container here
goes and it looks like it says like that
just pops off top like so
and then internally we have a an
internal thing which is like plastic
rather than foam also tucked away in
here is a little thread River booklet so
that tells you all the stuff you need to
know about thread Ripper got your thread
Ripper case badge on there because you
know case badges little thing and it
looks like a sticker and you know your
basic warranty information and that kind
of thing so that's good to have and then
this in here is your little kit since
the pr4 socket does have a Torx actual
screws in there that you need to undo
comes a little Torx wrench so you get to
go with that it says it ratcheting it's
not ratcheting but that's okay and then
here ah I can get it to come out and
then here is your actual retention
bracket and this will be compatible with
basically any standard eastex
cooling solution which is a really wide
variety of them going all the way back
to like the early Corsair units so all
those ones that have the combo pump
block on the front and it's difficult
T's circular attention mechanism can pop
that on and even though the contact area
does seem kind of small in those it is
still enough to go over the die than on
the actual threader for process area so
speaking of which let's move on to that
so I this this has a indicator on the
back it says unlock the power so if we
turn that prank pranks and opens and
then that's where the thread Ripper is
attached it's actually feels very
substantial when you pull that off
other than that this appears to just be
the optics of the eye of Sauron or
whatever whatever you want to call that
in there just giving it that sort of
multi panel view that looks pretty cool
and gives a nice visual as you first
open it so now that the powers unlocked
what do I do alright it's got a metal
bracket here pop that off over the top
and then
this and what happens I don't know what
to do
powers been unlocked such you push on
these oh alright I figured that these
tabs you'd squeeze these little tabs
directly and then it pops off like that
hey and then you've got your thread
Ripper CPU right there which comes with
its little carrier piece oh and I'm
going to try not to touch the bottom
because that's where all of my LGA
contacts are man these things are headed
those plastic piece around the processor
you actually want to hang on to because
that is part of the installation
procedure and I guess since I'm right
here and I have a motherboard let's do
my first-ever tr4 sockets CPU
installation which I've only seen in a
video by MSI so far so let's get on top
of that Wow like the lid is on a spring
it like pops up by itself
kind of kind of fascinating these are
captive screws just learn that that's
also pretty useful and then so once that
top lid is up there's a secondary lid
right here which slides up just like
that and that you can maybe see has a
little piece of plastic that's in it and
that is sort of a dummy that sits in
there and just slides out on the rails
we've got this kind of a rail system
like that slide another I guess it
wasn't held in there quite as sturdily
as I thought it was all right beyond
that you do have a plastic cover here to
protect the LGA socket and that pops off
like so and then the nice thing is here
no triangle on the corner what others
they'll triangle in the corner never
mind there's still there's still
triangle in the corner here if you're
really confused but I mean there's only
one way for this to drop in so let's do
it like that and I thought this would be
smoother oh I see all right so it
doesn't just stay on the rails you do
have to kind of guide it in at that
lower part once that once that lower
part is in there it just drops in the
rest of the way so that then that drops
down and the tr4 sockets cover goes on
top then you just tighten the screws in
I imagine you'd still want to do in a
sort of a cross pattern couldn't get
those screws to catch it first so maybe
do these two at the bottom first oh yeah
they are numbered one two three I should
pick those your attention there we go
close one two three I open three two one
see I should read stuff before I should
start doing it alright so I figured it
out even even even being ignorant so
guys there it is my first ever unboxing
of the thread Ripper processor my first
ever installation of a thread ripple
processor on the tr4 socket and a lot of
really cool and exciting new hardware to
play around with and I'm going to get
right to it and I will be bringing you
guys more content with my feedback my
benchmark numbers and everything like
that on this platform as well as whether
or not I think you should buy it let me
know in the comments section if you're
considering investing in thread refer
platform right now the thumbs up button
of course if you enjoyed the video and
I'll be back with more content coming at
you very soon thanks for watching guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
