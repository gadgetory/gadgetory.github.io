the sponsor link in the description to
learn more hey guys I am travelling so
this is a travel video there's not gonna
be a whole lot of Technology so just
wanted to point that out right up front
we're now in Japan and it was actually a
little bit challenging to get here we
left on a Friday morning first issue was
my fault I completely missed the time I
thought we were leaving it one where
you're actually leaving more at noon
then we had to drive to the airport we
were already a hour later than we
intended to be and we got there and lot
C at LAX was full that's crazy
and never happens so we I had to go over
to the parking spot parking spot was
full except for the valet so we ended up
parking at the valet which is like 25
bucks a day so that kind of sucked then
we got our boarding passes my seat was
reserved but my wife's for some reason
was not even though I had done it on the
website so I took up to the counter II
get her seat assigned and then they gave
us two different seats but then I asked
if they could see this next to each
other and ended up putting us in an exit
row and that was actually kind of nice
because we had lots of legroom for the
rest of the flight after we arrived to
Tokyo at Narita Airport we went and got
our JR passes because we had pre bought
those back in the States those are good
for the chair rails that go all over the
country and then we're able to use that
to get on the Narita Express and the
Narita Express goes into actual Tokyo we
actually went past Tokyo to Shinagawa
and then in Shinagawa got on the
Shinkansen which is the bullet train
which is really cool experience it stuff
we got on the wrong one fortunately we
were just able to go up one stop and
then we got off and waited one more
train and then got back on the trains
here in Japan are incredibly like
on-time and efficient and they're just
that you can set your watch by the
schedule so after that we finally got to
kyoto about 10 o'clock at night grabbed
a taxi and went up to yawn where we're
actually staying in that neighborhood
went and got some ramen real quick and
then we just knocked out and today is
our first full day of actually turning
around kyoto so we started off at the
shown in which is collection of soaring
buildings in spacious courtship
courtyards it's a Buddhist temple
basically it was very beautiful they had
massive shrines there actually done some
construction there right now so we
couldn't see the main temple itself
because there's a bunch of steel frame
work going up in a big
crane and stuff like that but just when
you enter you see the sanma on temple
gate which is the largest temple gate in
Japan that was very large and impressive
and for our time in Kyoto we're planning
on just doing some cultural experiences
we like going and visiting shrines that
kind of thing and then we're gonna move
on from here to Osaka hopefully get lots
of really good food and then we're gonna
end in Tokyo and if you're wondering
where we are now it's called the Shorin
in you can kind of see it back there
behind me it's a smaller temple and
there's some really cool gardens on the
ground so we've been wandering around
here I really appreciate a lot of the
carpentry like all the woodwork and
stuff that's done here in Japan I feel
like they are very meticulous about it
very precise and it's always very like
beautiful and pleasing to the eye so
we're going to walk back down the hill
and move on to our next destination
this guy just did a flyby on me like
this guy's really whoa no afraid it'll
be caon that guy this is the path I have
to I have to walk down the path there
but like he died mom meets like three
times like after I turned off the camera
that second ago I'm a little worried but
I'm gonna make a run for it here and try
to get past this this Raven or crow or
whatever it is following me is he okay
bye thank you for guarding that tree I
think he's guarding that tree it's a
very important big tree we're taking a
break and eating ice cream I got
chocolate and vanilla that's Jane and
Diana got green tea for now it ginkakuji
temple which is a Zen temple and a
UNESCO World Heritage Site and there's a
really cool sand sculptures I think do
they make the size of this so smooth
it's just a pile of sand like it should
turn into a volcano or something this
this is called agin shed on a sands
layout sorry if I'm mispronouncing aunty
we're currently walking down the
Philosopher's path just I just don't
know what to think
you shouldn't walk the Philosopher's
path every day but it's okay every now
and then you guys be very careful and
walking the Philosopher's path from
visiting temples over it to eating
penguins I got some crispy chicken here
Jim we had to get more views it cuz it's
really good
look how thin and light like the wrapper
is it's just it's so thin and light
first spot to eat lunch in here we guy
with two hours of it look at my wife
they're dressing the camera directly I'm
so proud there's a river it is a Magic
Hour
in Kyoto the evenings and we're gonna
wander the streets a little bit see if
we can plant some our places to eat and
enjoy guess the nightlife I don't know
what to call this
so the district that we're in right now
there are geishas actual real-life
geishas doing geisha things and this
sign is letting you know don't touch
them you're not allowed to touch the
geishas the man could lose his hand for
less or for touching the Geisha I don't
know guess you're not supposed to take
selfies with them you're not supposed to
litter on them or drop ice cubes on them
don't offer them cheeseburgers and
definitely don't smoke in front of them
very good advice David I've cones
fashion geishas own or other geishas
that can't find them this is chocolate
gateau cake which it means it's a
chocolate cat I think they got vanilla
ice cream
large orange torii gate we're not
Fushimi Inari Taisha as a Shinto shrine
it's very big and orange there's big
orange torii gates everywhere the
seemingly endless arcades of Vermillion
torii shrine torii gates spread across a
thickly wooded mountain this vast shrine
complex is a world unto its goal
it is quite simply Burmese impressive
and memorable sights in all of you the
entire complex consisting of five
shrines sprawls across the wooded slopes
of Inari see a pathway wanders for
kilometres up the mountainside as life
dozens of atmospheric subsurface fushimi
inari is dedicated to the gods of rice
and sake by the hottub family in the
eighth century as the rolls agriculture
diminished
DD's were enrolled to ensure prosperity
in business nowadays a shrine is one of
Japan's most popular in as a head shrine
for some 40,000 Inari's to transcribe
the length and breadth of the country as
you explore the shrine and we will team
across hundreds of stones boxes the Fox
is considered the messenger of Inari
the god of cereals and the stone Fox's -
are often referred to as in re the key
often seen in the Fox mouth is for the
rice granary on an incidental note the
Japanese traditionally see the Fox as a
secret somewhat mysterious figure
capable of possessing humans the fever
point of entry is under the fingernails
the walk round the upper precincts of
the shrine is apartment day hike it also
makes for a very eerie stroll and late
afternoon early
even a when the various graveyards and
miniature shrines alone take on a
mysterious air it's best to go with a
friend at this time so we're gonna get
possessed by a fox and have some sake
and some cereal so I had known not much
at all the Shintoism but the one thing
that you can't watch if you do come here
especially on a crowded day like today
is everyone had something to get
pictures by themselves with no one in
the background you just have to stick
wait for the right time but the crowds
to go by or if you if you crop the
people like like those people behind me
right now look you can't see him anymore
my head's in the way good thinking
little mini torii gates so techie then
these foxes over here have bibs on
they're probably getting ready for
dinner you had to go up the steps go up
higher get some altitude do some
exercise that not everyone's willing to
do then you can find the areas where oh
there's still people it's okay though
there are a lot of steps but it's
supposed to be a nice view at the top oh
sorry I can hide I've gotten someone's
picture I know if you're planning on
doing this it's a it's a real nice
workout but make sure you've got that
shape a little bit I guess Dan is doing
good
if you make it to the top you get ice
cream afterwards technically this isn't
the highest spot but this is the spot
with the best view there's kudo behind
us and on the other side of us is
Disneyland just kidding we just mean
gets crowded okay I think it's time for
lunch
crispy it is all the mix and crannies
this is the kiyomizu-dera which is a
buddhist temple that's being restored so
there's not much to see there although
there's a very beautiful view up to the
city of Tokyo there did I say Tokyo this
is Kyoto oh my dog arrived we found some
pretty flowers movies how about that one
in purple oh so these are blue
well we just left to Kyoto and now we're
on the Shinkansen bullet train to Osaka
also we're very tired
No
we made it to a Sukkah
which is really good because we were
able to shower and now we don't feel
like dying anymore
they also upgraded our room and we got a
nice view but for now we're gonna go eat
food cuz that's what you're supposed to
do in Osaka last we have discovered
sushi I'm so excited I'm really upset
right now okay I'm gonna let the camera
down any fat tuna they're like super fat
tuna
that grade two
finally the fatties look fat
or done eating sushi it was really
really good in case you guys wonder if
Rio went it's called suck a sushi Tamiya
machi and it's in the dotonbori district
so I'm Google Maps to find on
TripAdvisor is really good it was only
about like a little over fifty bucks for
both of us to eat all that sushi a night
of beer we're gonna go shopping now and
then we're gonna get dessert that must
be some bomb-ass ramen the line goes all
the way down there
we're gonna go get breakfast first up is
at a place called Mika Sudoku and I've
already impressed this by putting a
little kitty in my latte not a kitty
these are ricotta pancakes and they're
insanely fluffy
mine's not quite as fluffiest a honestly
it's still very pretty in the hat's
apples this looks red because I'm under
an umbrella so Mickey said Nick coke
cafe it was very good a little on the
expensive size about 32 bucks for that
meal which is a couple copies and two
plates of pancakes but amazing pancakes
I can't forget to pay 30 bucks for
pancakes
they better be damn good and they were
only like an hour since they had
breakfast but now we're getting ramen
each year on this place to have a
massive massive lion outside last night
so we've come a little bit early to make
sure we can get in get to serve in a
little booth here you want it strong
medium or light I'm gonna go
medium richness I will do rich garlic my
beer has arrived
your extra noodles that give to in the
middle of eating a soup when you're
ready for your refill you can click this
little Sun sensor on this and then they
know to bring you your extra notes
vanna's already getting extra noodles I
still barely touch my ramen place we
just do that and that is the line now
lunch rush is already piling up
that's right ladies and gentlemen by
popular request we're going into a cat
cafe 60 minutes for 1,200 yen it's about
12 bucks an hour hang out with cats what
could be better I just pay we're only
paying this is the counter will your
Grady pay
we may be too much food yesterday's
today we are trying something new more
sightseeing we're taking the subway and
now this Shinkansen bullet train
/ - cmeg castle
so himeji castle was built at a cost of
500 production units and has been
providing Japan with a boost to culture
a couple engineering points as well as a
15% combat bonus to troops in friendly
territory since the early 14th century
upon arriving at the train station of
the meiji you'll actually be able to see
the castle all the way down the main
street which leads all the way from the
train station up to the castle so you
could take the walk it's maybe 10 or 15
minutes and then once you get here it's
about a thousand yen to take the tour
walk around inside and that's about $10
u.s. i thought was a pretty cool
experience because the interiors built
mostly of wood it's made out of wood
rock plaster it's painted white on the
outside it's got gray roof tiles
everywhere and it's just beautiful my
wife was saying there's really no bad
angle to take a picture or video of this
castle from so you'll definitely be
happy if you come and take a look you do
have to take your shoes off to take the
tour walk around inside there are some
very steep staircases and slippery socks
on your feet so watch your head there's
also some low-rises that you got to deal
with but you can get yourself all the
way up to the top and you can see some
pretty cool things like the design that
they've made so they can protect the
castle from attackers from any different
angle racks where they would store
weapons so they could have easy access
to them and of course some helpful
plaques along the way so you can sort of
read out some of the history for
instance this has been restored multiple
times since it was originally built out
of like one of the main pillars was
built out of one massive tree that
started to rot at the bottom so they had
to fix set up last time that they fixed
it up was about fifty years ago and I
believe that is a important historical
period in Japan known as the hamaji
restoration yes I just made a historical
Japanese pun so a major castle is built
up on a hill which makes sense because
it's a defensive position it was
originally a fort and also it means if
you hike up all the way to the top
you're gonna get an amazing view during
in sixty degree view of the city if
you're willing to look through some
wires that they have up there for
people's protection and then if you're
willing to pay 40 yen more on top of
your ticket you can come here see these
lovely gardens which are great next to
it not much of a view of the castle up
above but there are some big old fish
and pretty flowers and there's also a
praying mantis that attacks me
okay
we are now headed away from Osaka so
Thank You Osaka we're very full and the
food is delicious we're now headed to
Tokyo on the Shinkansen and we got like
a day and a half left but some cool
stuff planned in Tokyo
we're heading down this magical again
Street so her first major that's the
nation in Tokyo at least just outside it
took you I think you guys like breeze
but what is this place so confused ready
this is the staging area this is where
the actual show is gonna happen right
now
we're in the pre-show sell the audience
a bunch of stuff mode like popcorn or
more drinks or whatever that girls
and
the robot restaurant experience last
night was pretty intense pretty crazy so
we thought today we'd settle things down
a little bit and kind of go carts
probably safe this is Mari car it's been
recommended to us by just about everyone
who we've tweeted about this trip so far
there are actual go-karts we're actually
driving them and if you want to do this
you're definitely gonna need an
international driver's license which
actually isn't too hard to get you just
got to go to triple-a and have a valid
driver's license triple-a is the only
place that they will accept the
international driver's license from so
we're that mine we forget exactly how
much it cost the Triple A but it's like
20 bucks for the service speed to do
that and then you also need to bring
them like a picture like you'd have in a
passports and then you get your
international driver's license any
costumes to choose from
Avantika princess crown
I can't go in a camera while we're
driving so you possibly the like in the
GoPro
alright guys this is it I am back at
Narita I'm actually leaving here to go
to Taipei to cover Computex my wife is
gonna be leaving in a few hours to go
back home to LA and I create the dog so
we're probably pretty anxious to see us
on behalf of myself and my wife though
to everyone who we met here in Japan I
already got though gozaimashita we had a
wonderful time I'm sorry if I've been
trying to pronounce that properly this
entire time we're here but there's an
amazing trip if you guys have a chance
to come to Japan I really recommend it
because it's an amazing country amazing
food amazing people so much history and
all kinds of other stuff to thank you
guys for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it I
will be back soon with more regular
coverage I'm assuming the Computex stuff
is finished I hoped that all went smooth
but that's all for this one guys
thanks again we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
