this travel vlog begins as so many
travel vlogs do at the airport next
thing I know I found myself with an
airplane sorry they got passed out for a
while
but I know one thing
- we'll be proud
this is the Ninoy Aquino International
Airport in Manila in the Philippines
however this is not our final
destination
oh no more traveling still to be had but
a glorious sunset over Manila
this is airport number three on our
travels we're now in koala Lumpur that's
right Malaysia but why are we here well
we have a 12 hour layover pretty much
we're just gonna stay in a hotel for one
night but still now I can say I've been
to Kuala Lumpur amazing
we're in Cambodia now this is the part
of this points in our journey it's
probably the farthest around the world
that I have ever been so that's
we're gonna be going and seeing Angkor
Wat which if you guys aren't familiar
with it's a world heritage site and that
is the purpose of our journey here
although I have one other purpose in
mind if you guys aren't aware I'm a big
fan of the film predator and Jesse the
body Ventura is character in that movie
has a very one of the he says lots of
fantastic things for that movie but one
of them is this makes Cambodia looks
like look like Kansas and I always like
to say that line and now when I say it
I'm gonna be able to say it with a lot
more confidence I will actually be able
to say yes this does make Cambodia look
like Kansas so I'm gonna be keeping my
eye out for reasons to say that in the
meantime this is this is the airport at
Siem Reap and I'm probably pronouncing
that terribly but here's a look we have
arrived at our hotel this is the bourree
Angkor seems very nice so far they're
just getting a room set up
we've been greeted with this green tea
and it's not tea what is it it is okay
it's made from some type of vegetable
that is green it's it's liquid and you
can drink it and then here is this is
some sweet rice with I'm not sure what's
inside but it's in a banana leaf and
it's delicious here's our room at the
hotel look at this woodwork is amazing
it's everywhere okay got the TV mirrors
good stuff we have a fancy control panel
over here for controlling all the things
and then this is our view straight out
here onto the pool very very nice hotel
this is extremely highly rated on
TripAdvisor my wife found it it's
fantastic and I recommend everyone comes
and visits Cambodia and stays here
have you ever tried to get a nice
panning shot of angkor wat while the Sun
rises the two-year-old cellphone I have
yeah this guy lost his face we're now
approaching the gates to Angkor Thom and
our guide null has just told us that
Angkor Thom means big city and actually
at the time when the city was at the
height of its prosperity they were like
a million people here when at the same
time in like England there is only a few
hundred thousand people pretty
impressive and the cool thing about
Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom and
everything is that it's very mysterious
no one really knows what caused the
decline of this civilization here and in
their spaces there's also faces up there
too but you should be aware of
yeah they just drive cars through
motorcycles bicycles or you can walk
a little bit of rain
right now we're exploring what is known
as happy temple because there's a bunch
of faces up on these towers up here and
they're all happy happy faces
I like this temple now as I show you
guys a little bit of Angkor Wat this is
probably a good time for me to explain
to you I guess I should say apologize to
you because um really this video should
look a lot better I actually purchased a
camera to take on this trip which I left
I left at home I didn't leave it home I
left my parents house when we were
stopping by there but so my apologies
that these this is being still being
filmed on the
smartphone camera from the lg optimus G
which is getting to be quite out of date
now but um it's it's all ahead so it was
this or nothing so many of these temples
were built between the 12th and 13th
14th century there's a lot of
restoration and stuff that was done in
the 16th century and there's lots of
these cool carvings everywhere the
things you see most are snakes like
these right here should be Naga snakes
which are like mythical snakes and they
always have an odd number of heads like
this guy's got seven heads and they're
there to protect the temples and whatnot
it's a mixture of Hindu and Hinduism and
Buddhism and some back and forth going
on there as well and then apart from the
snakes you also have the kind of
mythical Lions to show up two times and
also of course elephants there's
elephants everywhere it seems like they
do pretty constant maintenance on these
temples that are all over the place
including this one they're cutting all
the greenery off and there's a dude
sitting up on top you must have a very
nice view up there well he's not getting
much done
so the temple visiting now is actually
where they did some shooting of the Tomb
Raider movie which is kind of cool
although it also means it's insanely
crowded there's lots of people here but
adding to the mystery of this place is
the question why is there a Stegosaurus
carved into this well it's good Scottish
what's our monitor
the rain is pulling straight down
slightly to the side lake around here
there's so much stuff that has been
restored over the years there's a lot of
stuff that's still original this
sandstone is actually all original and
the reason it's still in such great
shape even though it's a thousand plus
years old or maybe less than a thousand
but almost thousand is that this whole
thing was actually covered by a massive
termite mound and it preserved protected
it and then they cleared it away later
on and everything is all nice and nice
and fresh sweet termites saving
antiquities since the 12th century all
right never die get some dinner and
we're taking one of Sam graves primary
modes of transportation at least if
you're a tourist it's called a tip tip
just get a little scooter up redress to
see her in the back just like that one
right there which you guys probably
can't see cuz it's really dark right now
that's it's a little bit terrifying due
to the traffic but very very reasonably
priced means of transportation they sure
to make the night market easy to find
here
to top off ones night at the night
markets you should get this it's called
a magic stick and it's full of ice cream
and apparently deliciousness and just
like that we're back at the airport
boarding airplane
we've seen some antiquities we've had a
wonderful time in Cambodia this ship is
still far from over
that's right we're going back to the
Philippines
ladies and gentlemen we are an honor
panel approach and we'll be landing in a
few minutes please check that your
seatbelts are securely fastened
our eco vivo Airport
sunset in the Philippines this is
antique a province we're in the seaside
town of London and today is Friday which
means that the wet market is open that's
where we're headed to right now to buy
some delicious food so here's a visit to
visit taste of the time dynamic market
yeah
like it
you don't like your fish wet they'll
subs right
a mini-dress fish chicken
what you are getting here
that's dinner
sausages a problem honey said
which is delicious and it jump some
goodness in it
that isn't it showing I want to dedicate
this moment to my friend Joe if you're
watching this this one's for you that's
fresh take the skins
and now welcome everyone to a little
place in the Philippines called Baraka
it is sunset it is beautiful quite a few
people around but no wonder there's a
lovely white sand beach we've been going
in the in the water a little bit today
we're gonna walk down and find some
places to have dinner and enjoy the
sunset and it's a lovely day it's a
beautiful place and you guys should all
visit here at some point so today we're
gonna do our activities
Cisco of number two there they climb
through a very small tunnel to get here
small Cove
right
and very choppy waves coming in that's
where the pirate treasure is buried
if we show
that didn't help at all
so there you go guys it's a little taste
of my vacation this is Baraka it's a
wonderful place to go Hilo crowded at
times and you got to deal with some
vendors but definitely very
cost-effective if you're looking for a
nice idyllic white sand beach and
beautiful sunsets and all that good
stuff but thank you for watching this
video I really appreciate it
stay tuned for more videos that are not
like this I've been doing some travel
vlogs for this summer but I don't have
any travel for a while now so I'll be
doing more tech stuff I promise
thank you so much for watching don't
forget to subscribe and see you all
later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
