go button I just did it from the
drop-down all right
should be live now just about yes I see
myself cool hey everyone and welcome
this is awesome hardware it's a live
show about technology and we stream to
twitch TV / awesome hardware every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time the show's split up into two halves
this is episode number 150 it's our
sesquicentennial episode and right now
Kyle's getting a fan because it's hot we
live in Southern California and it's
decided like hey let's be warm now and
so Kyle is just setting up the fan back
there behind me as things get started
for today a quick word of warning we do
drink some beer on the show that's just
kind of something that we do so feel
free to drink along with us if you have
a of age and drink responsibly
but also be warned that we do
occasionally use adult language so this
this show is aimed at adults so if you
are not cool with hearing an occasional
curse word not like all the time it's
not like we're completely uncouth or
anything like that but we'll probably
curse less with the fan on so we can
stay cool anyway though I am really
quickly going to plug our stores so if
you'd like to help support us and you're
watching the show live in particular you
can go to pulsar Burnett for my store we
have the last chance right now for this
limited edition metallic that feels
wonderful it's quiet its quiet no
oscillate let's toss Lee no no why would
you want to toss lee should be pointed
directly at us it's probably gonna cause
wind noise in the mic okay alright we'll
stick with oscillations around
okay give it a shot that's us feel
glorious it's the last chance to get
yourself one of these one of these
metallic silver thumbscrew t-shirts on
the tribe lens and the hoodies new
thumbscrew on heavy Heather Navy and
oxblood so this is the Heather Navy
Heather midnight navy look at that that
color I mean this really shows a lot of
class and sophistication right there
anyway buy stuff if you buy stuff during
the show you can always also buy stuff
from bit with tech slash store from Kyle
yeah and we'll shout your name out will
yell Johnson at chef and we will thank
you of course for supporting us and it's
it's nice merchandise to Kyle
also has good merchandise bottle opening
the bottle opener he's holding right now
I was walking through the house the
other day and someone complimented me on
my glasses as I was walking to our
kitchen with these well there you go and
and I thought it was really strange that
she complimented my eyeglasses and it
wasn't till I got to the kitchen halfway
through washing the glasses when I
realized she was talking about these
glasses I thought no really snazzy like
what I thought wow was it can see
glasses that can but it was actually
these lip but it was these ones which is
good because these are available for
sale and she doesn't even watch the
channel so you know they're good
completely unbiased oh yes I'll block it
I'll block it yes no one can see your
password alright today we're gonna talk
about some hot and heavy hardware
Intel's cancelled to keep you like X
processors new case from in win its new
fans from Noctua finally and the first
kind of more legit rumor leaked thing
for the GTX 1180 yeah invidious upcoming
graphics card so very excited thank
y'all for joining us today
and I was about to like go right into a
nice choose the cows got a poor beer
I do pour that beer Kyle porn where that
beer not on the laptop he was born not
in my eye
be careful into the cup
and what was that why did that make a
noise stop that
cheers you mother-effer cheers and
cheers to all of you thanks for joining
us guys thanks it's for being here okay
go a can no one likes you just giving
you a damn sometimes cam is occasionally
useful all right
adios good cool cool we started off with
some questionable audio but it appears
to have fixed itself that fix itself we
fixed a bit we were gonna have reggae
playing in the background this time but
I think since we changed the audio
settings it's gone so that's fine what
all right whatever
yes all right first segment is not in my
PC
none of these are accurate hold on won't
update this we prepared for today yeah
we did what is my first thing time have
you heard where each there it is that is
okay sorry honeybee hurry hey hey
committed to the lower thirds that we
spent about 10 seconds each to set up
all right KPIX first thing we're going
to talk about we thought KB Lakes X was
stupid and apparently all of you guys
did too
I can't be like X if you're not familiar
was just a couple CPUs that were based
on KB Lake architecture launched along
with a guy like X and it was it was an
i7 and an i-5 a fork or eight thread and
a fork or four thread CPU built for the
X 299 platform LGA 2066
which was which was very high it's the
high end desktop platform from from
Intel
so it's everyone was like why why would
you do this you have a mainstream
platform if there was no mainstream
platform than it might have made sense
you know give people a way to get in on
on X 299 and everything but Intel did it
anyway
in my opinion they they should have
marketed marketed it as a niche item
that was made specifically for
overclockers if they had tried to sell
it that way I think people would have
been more okay with it but they didn't
they were like hey here's a here's a
viable product the people should buy and
everyone was like no that's stupid if
you first have off the motherboard they
had to buy to go along with this was
gonna cost you a minimum of like 300
bucks maybe 250 if you could get away
with it so that's a premium right there
and then the motherboard that you just
paid a bunch of money for you slap one
of these processors in two and you get
yourself 16 PCIe lanes instead of 44 but
you get what the high-end ones are 28
with the the six core and you also only
get dual channel memory so of you're
like eight DIMM slots you get to use
half of them or if you had one of those
motherboards that only had four dimm
slots then you only get to use two of
them so it's really stupid nobody liked
it there were a few niche areas that
they were useful like overclocking they
were pretty good at overclocking they
were good for memory overclocking but
they're just completely impractical so
good riddance not too surprising then
Intel end-of-life to them early this is
definitely pretty early since they only
launched just last year with the x2 9 9
stuff mid to 17 not not that not the
lengthiest lifespan for a an Intel
processor but the Tom's Hardware article
has their milestones for the end-of-life
process product discontinuous
discontinuance program last corporate
assurance product critical date
basically November is when most of the
most of stuff happens orders are non
cancelable for I guess for retailers or
whatever yeah
so no more cable ik X EA the PC
landscape is slightly less confusing
moving on an win has introduced a couple
a one series Mini ITX enclosures this is
a WCCO tech article all these things but
it's actually this isn't rumor and
speculation these are actually have been
posted on and when
landing page so they have these at CES
and stuff and Computex yes yeah so this
is a pretty cool-looking little mini ITX
case and it's yeah it's got tempered
glass anodized aluminum on the frame the
bottom is transparent around here and
will light up with RGB lights which
everyone likes see here here you can see
it in pink which is very very alluring
color it is a small case but it holds 20
litres if you want to fill it with
liquid which you probably shouldn't do
since you're gonna have a computer in
there or not
does still support our coolers up to 160
millimeters also supports dual slot
graphics card you can see an asus strix
card that they fit in there up to 300
millimeters in length so still supports
all your high-end hardware the only
thing that this points me is the front
panel IO just a bit you got a couple USB
3.0 ports but I'd like to see a Type C
up there I'd like to see a 3.1 gen2 port
up there and just I'm getting that's a
new fan of the two-tone either it's a
new case not you don't like the two-tone
like thirds I think it looks ok on the
black model the white model light with
the red or the white with the blue oh no
the to time the i/o have I just just
like gray yeah yeah ok cleaner in white
and I asked I'm also not a huge fan I
like the case but the bottom trend
transparent part I'm not a huge it's
like it's like if you took a mini ITX
case and put it inside of a clear
high-heel is this kind of is this Marcus
your heels we're clear here is a little
bit of getting some clear heels vibes no
no I feel like I maybe would have to see
a video or something - is there a video
there is a video thank thank god there's
a video let's let's watch this on
youtube let's see if we can actually see
oh good they have the entire design
process look would use a 5 hour video
pictures on there's a nice elevator shot
I do love them just I do like the
honeycomb exhaust yeah and when has done
a multiple it's a good job on that so
there's a shot of your part that you
hate you have to silver alright show us
I don't hate it I'm just not a huge fan
Kyle hates this case no I didn't say
that I thought this was the RGB LEDs and
it's not
where are the RGB LEDs up here up here
there wow that was quick
this is oh this is clearly don't want
you to see the highly produced video
orchid aren't you look at all the
movement ins and everything it's so fast
you can't even see the goddamn products
how you know it's really highly produced
didn't meant to mention this but there's
an optional qi wireless charging station
that you can add to the top I don't
believe that's included by default oh
and give me buy that separately it's
that it's not there they're not showing
it what are you sorry what are you
looking for I wanted a video of the RGB
LEDs on the bottom just so I could see
it in action if they're fading or
whatever just there's literally this is
the single shot of it you get right here
just I mean it doesn't look all that
like I feel like the the since it's so
transparent the whole thing's
transparent it almost like there's an
inner needs to be more led for how much
transparent plastic there is it may mean
it had been a sliver of transparent
stuff then it would really look full the
lighting would look really like clean
and it also needs to be this like they
that that was the light with a bunch of
other light around it if that was just
the case on a desk with no other light
and that was the only light then it
might look cooler possibly but but maybe
you're not the LED strip come included
or do you have to add your own it's the
the LEDs part of including not included
in the case the RGB bottom part there so
it's this a fan mount right there like
the back and then the side and you can
you mount fans at the bottom
I get one fan there exhauster for a
cooler a liquid cooler perhaps I don't
know if you could put a liquid over
there
yeah about 120 you might you have to
have a really short graphics card yeah
your private well anyway there's some
exhaustive so yeah I guess the airflow
would be a kind of a question on this
maybe is there maybe it's ventilated on
the bottom I think it is yeah I think
and you can kind of see right here I'm
just I can't remember if there are fan
mounts down there I want to say yes I
want to say there are but I don't see
any they should advertise that if if you
can put fans down there yeah that would
be good to know
nice looking case yeah looks pretty cool
I like small cases and the layouts the
layouts pretty cool too so I didn't
mention but it includes the power supply
so it's 170 dollars which is expensive
but like a piece you can includes a
power supply so if you're gonna spend
like I feel like 150 dollars is a
reasonable price for a case in a power
supply you can get a pretty good power
supply in a pretty good case for about
350 bucks yeah so this is mini ITX so
maybe that makes it a smaller but
there's expensive mini ITX cases - this
is ready for pre-order on their store
their East or the in wind store if you
wanna order it directly on May 15th so
next week
planned shipping date of May 30th but
they said targeting a shipping date of
May 30th so I guess they're they're not
100% confident in that you know you
never know with case shipments they're
always potential for delay true if it's
a brand new case alright let's go with
one more hot and heavy hardware item
here which is Noctua finally finally has
released the nf8 12 by 25 it's like when
Disney releases a movie just a stupid
stupid name it's a stupid name I'm not
too a fit and F is not a fan I'm just
making this out this is an amazing name
he's got a stand for airflow twelve
hundred and twenty millimeter yeah that
makes perfect sense
yes search engineering name it's not an
F in twelve by twenty five PWM just
actually comes in
in several models so umm Noctua has a
little video on it here
they've teased this at Computex like
every year that I've been going to
Computex maybe not that long but you go
by and like here's this fan we've been
working on and I go for the past like
three or four years but that means they
spend a lot of time working on it the
blades themselves is what they spend a
lot of time on and they actually have a
pants patented new material and they're
made out of they've called it sterics s
ter ro X due to the rigidity of sterics
liquid crystal polymer of the Vegas of
the love the sterics liquid crystal
polymer it can be used to make fans with
a very small tip clearance so it can
match or even beat two of naktu as
regular n ff12 fans in cooling
performance tip clearance tip clearance
so they're talking specifically about a
cab frame the gap between the tip of the
fan and the frame
I see the fan frame right there so they
can if they want to be as small as
possible they want that to be as small
as possible because reducing that to
having that that that record tape tip
clearance increase in air tight kind of
yeah so it increases the efficiency it
reduces vacuum leak flow out of there
also the exceptionally low thermal
expansion coefficient and excellent
dimensional stability and health as well
and this is actually something that I
recall talking to Noctua about when I
went and talked to them at Computex
which is that look it's not that
difficult to make fan blades that are
really really close to the edge of the
fan housing right what's difficult is
when those fans are spinning and those
fans are heated that they still have
that very low clearance because with the
material that you build the fans out of
there's a certain amount of expansion
that might come when the materials
warmed up for the blades things might
expand I see and also you know do the
due to the rotation so they needed a
material that they could produce that
shit wasn't ridiculously expensive to
produce that would maintain its shape
that also had other factors like being
relatively lightweight and all that kind
of stuff beyond just the material that
it's made out of the they've got these
little
ridges and stuff like here and like
every time you see if a fan they always
like point like oh yeah this cool fan
blade design like we put these little
notches in it or whatever and I'm always
like that's bullshit yeah not to is the
only company where I'm like I've this is
probably legit a students they probably
tested like test hundreds and thousands
of different fan blade design types in
order to make sure that you know
whatever little grooves they're doing
and there aren't just aesthetic or
whatever they're actually helping it's
the oil slight that it almost looks like
it wouldn't do much right it's just so
subtle but like they're calling this a a
Oh or advanced acoustic optimization for
the frame and flow except they coat they
call them they called flow acceleration
channels on the blades and they have
several versions of this that they will
be selling a 4-pin PDF PWM version that
will have automatic speed control if you
plug it into a PDF PWM controlled fan
header they're also going to do a three
pin FL X version that will have low
noise adapters that ship in the box so
you can do three different speed
settings even if you're plugging them
directly into just your standard 12 volt
connector from molex or something like
that
near-silent 3 pin ultra ultra low noise
version also will be available price
actually is two million dollars not as
bad as I thought it was gonna be twenty
that's 30 30 US dollars twenty nine
ninety is the suggested retail price in
the US twenty nine ninety is also the
suggested retail price in euros if
you're gonna buy this in the EU or
someplace that trades in Euros they also
have prices for the NFP 12 redux that
they have also released along with this
announcements as well as this adaptor oh
it's an adapter frame so you can use the
120 millimeter fan on 140 millimeter
water cooling radiator that's a bull
that's a bold statement like 120
millimeter fan will do better on your
280 millimeter radiator definitely a
vote of confidence
yeah and interesting but why here some
test but why not make these fans black
that's a good question and I like
knocked Whois there so they're very
particular about the color and they got
complaints and completes
took some years of people complaining
like we love your fans they're so well
made and you know they're expensive but
you buy them and you realize because
they're just really good fans
performance wise and noise wise and
everything and it took years of like
harassment for them to release the
industrial design ones that are the the
gray and black or whatever rank so yeah
my guess would be that they will also
make this in that same color maybe make
an industrial industrial version of the
NFA 12 by 25 I just feel like they would
dominate the market like if they if they
played the game a little bit but you
also have to remember that not to uh
like we are not well I can't say this
for sure but we are definitely not
knocked to as only customer they make
fans and cooling solutions that you know
PC enthusiasts like to take and put into
their computers but they also have
industrial contracts that with like
large companies they work with an
enterprise level where they do
specialized products for cooling of
stuff that needs cooling I like right I
don't know specifically so I don't want
to speculate beyond that but I just know
that and when I have gone to their booth
at Computex and stuff like the last time
I went there they had this massive block
of copper and they're like you're hold
this it okay like wow it's heavy and
it's like they taking stuff like that
that needs to be machines to like some
insane level of precision so that they
can use it and I don't even know I don't
remember what they're using it it's cool
it for but they get paid a lot for that
type of thing I have to imagine so
that's interesting there that they have
so many clients outside of the PC like
sort of PC enthusiasts space may be an
enterprise realm or where else that
their fans kind of like almost trickle
down to us like you know any mean like
they don't miss it like knock - it
doesn't need our business in a sense
which could explain why they don't go
the RGB route to know it like littered
all their fans with Natalie they're just
LEDs are professional trolls and worry
like haha maybe they like the haters you
get
tan and maroon or and you like
invariance of that forever all right
let's move on though to some stay no no
let's move on to nothing
oh no the Lords say nothing I love this
segment there should be a segment where
we literally just talk about nothing I
would be a good segment right
it'd be like Tech Talk because they
don't they don't that's their mo they
don't get on they don't typically put no
yeah show planning because just very
well they misinterpreted as a as a
shots-fired right wasn't that no it's
not intended to be a psycho you mean
Jerry and Jay
I've often those nothing say I have
there's many times what I've been very
jealous of their show format Blake we
don't know and like the format of not
having one is because that's that's
convenient sometimes it's Joey
all right uh so moving on to some some
standard tech news my half might be
slightly short my to absolutely but
that's fine
that's okay short so let's talk about
the gtx 1180 stuff so this is an article
on on TechRadar that's all of the stuff
we're talking about is linked in the
video's description by the way if you
want the links this is the actual tech
power up entry and tech power up runs
gpu-z
so tech power up does data harvesting in
order to create publication there to to
enhance and fill out their database of
graphics cards and that kind of thing
from my understanding didn't move the
fan has moved it slowly rotated so it's
not pointing at us any Mets a shit fan I
was gonna point that it's not even my
fan it's not I don't it in the hallway
the other day and I just brought it just
stole fan you stole a fan Wow but it's
been in the hallway for like oh well
okay you just lift it rotate the whole
thing base and I know there's more than
one way to rotate a fan the right way
okay geez Chet says you should have fuse
used to knock to a fan
haha that's okay
good job chat so yeah yeah the gtx 1180
I'd say the biggest like assuming this
is legit because it seems like it
probably is it seems like the biggest
news here is that it's called gtx 1180
now there's a list a list of
specifications on the technic from tech
power up map that you can look at and
you should also pay attention to this
read a bit of text here that this
graphics card is not released yet data
on this page may change in the future
they've included stuff like the codename
of the GPU the GV one a GV 104 Volta
architecture 12 animator process as well
as some other stuff like clock speeds
14.5 megahertz base 1582 megahertz boost
16 gigs of DDR 6 memory 384 gigabytes
per second bandwidth 3584 cuda cores
which is which is a lot damn that's a
lot more status that's about a thousand
more than the 1080 1080 has which was
had 2560 224 TM use vs. 160 on the
original 1080 the 12 nanometer process
as opposed to the 16 nanometer process
of the 1080 and yeah where's where's the
F people floating yeah floating-point
performance fp6 for right no this is
epi32 13 teraflops I'm sorry this is the
render configuration this is gigaflops
does the article different than what
this text says that could be this is
eleven thousand three hundred forty
maybe this was updated the article here
says here dude dude around thirteen
teraflops yeah spec saying thirteen 911
this is eleven thousand three hundred
forty so maybe that's part of the text
down here this is a placeholder page and
details will be added or updated as they
become available
I mean that's possibly even something
that was changed or it might have been a
typo from the article I the GTX eleven
eighty is changing at a rapid rate yes
it's constantly like nanotechnology it's
modular it learns it grows it's like
very impressive very impressive it's in
the shimmer still still can't quite run
crisis though okay anyway so peak FB
thirty-two performance of either
thirteen teraflops or what was listed
there more like 11 ish teraflops still
still impressive because the 1080 has
8.7 teraflops FB 32 performance and the
Titan XP is twelve teraflops so this one
has more it's added a little bit more or
attempt potentially a little bit less
floppy yeah other speculation the code
name listed is GB 104 the V in that name
would be GeForce Volta but the rumor
about this series of grabbed the
graphics card was that it was going to
be using touring which is the Volta
refinement we discussed a little bit
about speculation on upcoming in video
stuff at this point it's difficult to
say so it might be that they're just
sticking with the V because touring is a
refinement of Volta or it might be that
the entry is wrong or it might be just
the videos trolling us trying to confuse
us and or something like that reduce
we're not really sure for sure but this
does appear to be data derived from
engineering sample GPU according to the
article and speculation has been that
this graphics card will be entering mass
production soon it should be if they
have a working example going on that's
um
feeding data to tech power up so
Computex are you suspecting that they're
gonna announce this at Computex that's
possible we might see early versions or
an announcement or something like that
you never know
but NVIDIA has also been known to avoid
the big events like Computex in CES in
order to make an announcements on their
own or at a smaller event where they can
have a little bit more of the spotlight
but we'll see what they actually do
previous chatter according to the
article has held that a luncheon could
come around games come in August but
that still wouldn't necessarily mean
that they won't wouldn't announce it or
give more information around Computex so
we'll have to see
yeah coputex is a month away actually
just under a month away now fucking
babies very soon okay let's move on I
don't have extensive notes for this
story but I did want to bring it up
because it came across my newsfeed
earlier this week you do not have to
bring it up I did I do oh did I say
didn't I could Jude I want to bring it
up okay he wastes yeah I spotted this
earlier gamers Nexus also covered this
this is just kind of a sad story of a
dude who set up a company is based here
in California and he made the decision
to create 48,000 restore CDs and he
purchased for less than five cents a
piece basically he's an e-waste
recyclers he has set up an e-waste
recycling facility I believe it says
something like a hundred employees and
he was trying to figure out a good way
to allow people to make use out of
laptops and old computers that had a
Windows license but due to whatever old
myths or lack of accessories or whatever
or maybe the operating system got
corrupted or something like that aren't
usable but all they really need is a
restored disk mm-hmm now a lot of
laptops will ship with the restore disk
or where you can create what used to be
right you can create it yourself sure
but
some end users don't know how to do that
and so a lot of this stuff just ends up
getting chucked into the e-waste bin and
then it's it's not being made use of so
in order to extend the lifespan of these
devices this guy Eric decided to create
a bunch of restore CDs it could
generically be used with Windows laptops
and Windows computers to restore windows
onto that activate the license where he
ran afoul of Microsoft was that he was
selling these for I believe 25 cents
apiece or something like that yes he was
selling them for 25 cents a piece to to
repair shops and that kind of thing but
Microsoft caught wind of its originally
Microsoft has said that so like what the
the Microsoft standpoint and this is
kind of frustrating because that what
they're saying is that a repair shop
person who got a hold of this secondhand
merchandise and then refurbished or
whatever refurbished it or whatever and
then sold it to an end user they that
person should have been responsible for
somehow like paying Microsoft for a new
license for that laptop or something
like that when I or the seller sorry but
the person who's reselling the used
laptop right which is ridiculous because
any like PC store owner or something
like that knows how to do a restore on a
laptop and you get it functional again
and Microsoft is losing no money from
like yeah repair facilities that are
doing that because I've been because
Eric was able to because Eric made so
many of these restore CDs and was
selling them albeit at a very low price
to recoup his costume whatever they came
down on him there was a lawsuit involved
and he just recently lost his appeal on
this and he's actually gonna have to go
to prison for 15 months what which is
which is just frustrating because it's
stupid because
when the guy's goal is to do a waste
recycling which is which is a noble I
feel like a noble enterprise there's
tons and tons of e-waste it's often not
disposed of properly and you know he's
created a business out of this
so yeah just wanted to is there anything
in Microsoft's Terms of Service that
explicitly says you cannot sell a
restorer yeah I'm no I I don't want to I
want to give the impression that
Microsoft is somehow doing something
that's outside the bounds of legality
like they have the legal backing I'm
sure that the in the Terms of Service
and whatever like this is this is our
this has gone through court already and
he's and he's lost his appeal so it's
not like Microsoft doesn't have the
legal standing for this but Microsoft's
saying originally they said that two
hundred dollars per person per CD was
what he that's had somehow robbed
Microsoft of and was liable for
eventually lowered that to twenty-five
dollars but even that was still pretty
low so twenty-five dollars times the
number of CDs that he made equals the
weight and that's well that's why he's
looking at jail time is because of the
total dollar amount that was involved
there so Jesus seven hundred thousand
dollars but they what they claimed he
infringed upon Microsoft's products
worth so that that sucks articles linked
in the description if you guys want to
read any more again I apologize I didn't
have enough time prior to the show to
get more detailed notes on this but um I
Eric we we feel for you i i hope there's
some further action that can be taken to
prevent him from having to go to jail or
something like that because it sounds
like he's got a pretty good company
going on beyond this whole thing with
the restore cds you know go to jail for
a while and have to have somebody else
run your company then your company sucks
after you get back that's four movies
that's that but if what if this changes
like the whole like prison ecosystem
like after this guy goes to prison and
like finally gets out like the whole
like prison system is just flooded with
restore cds like Windows Restore discs
you know we just start seeing it like
start seeing like in movies you know it
changes pop culture we see like
prisoners trading singer
it's for Windows Restore disks as a
danger snortin just Raylan lines of coke
off of restore disks like this guy could
could have easily changed the the jail
world as we know it
that's probably an influencer probably
growing influence that's probably not
gonna happen but you've put an idea into
my mind of like a kind of a cheesy
b-movie that's made with that premise
right I'm doing it I think it could
happen
okay let's on that note let's round out
the tech news article from a named tech
about BD r5 hey yes are you talking to
you're not familiar with ddr5 it is the
fifth boiler alert successor to ddr4 Oh
likes build up to that once ddr4 has run
its course it will be replaced by ddr5
and it's cadence and micron have demoed
a ddr4 ddr5 4400 imc and memory
controller and memory
we're expecting products based on this
and 2019 possibly 2020 the hardware
they're using is manufactured based on
using TSM C's 7 nanometer process
technology the idea here is that
introducing the actual functional
silicon and with the sorry creating the
silicon based on the specification
developed by Jack will allow SOC
developers to begin their ddr5 memory
subsystems subsystem development which
should hopefully allow them to get to
market in 2019 or 2020 so I don't think
there was any like big speculation that
like DDF are ddr5 wouldn't work or
something like that but it's just a
little bit more details available about
it now this is ddr5 4400 speed and
there's already ddr4 memory running at
that speed
they are expecting it to scale up to
ddr5 6464 hundred mega transfers per
second
the demo again was running at 4400 mega
transfers per second so 2200 megahertz
actual speed and the cast latency 42
which might sound a little loose when it
comes to timings does but remember the
timings are a function of the of the
frequency and the timing the number on
the timing is just the number of cycles
so if the frequency is higher then more
cycles are happening per second
yeah so it it it scales so right
probably at the low ends like when we
originally saw ddr4 introduced around
2133 speed and it was kind of like on
par or even slower than some of the
faster ddr3 it's gonna be about the same
you're gonna have ddr5 that comes out
that seems a little bit slower or just
about as fast as the fastest ddr5 I'm
sorry ddr4 but then ddr5 will will
become faster after that now with ddr4
you know 3000 speed and above is much
more common than your 21 33 or 2,400 but
yeah other that's the voltage is going
from one point two volts
down to one point one volts although
even with ddr4 it's supposed to be one
point two volts but most if you're
running fast reading it faster speed
usually still run it at one point three
five so maybe ddr5 you'll still be able
to run at one point to probably man so
2019-20 that would be what on intel's
platform maybe we'll see ddr5 be
introduced with z5 70 or 470 ah I don't
even want to speculate I mean the
chipset names anything like that I
really hope they figure out the chipset
x67 naming stuff and just just choose
something different or new x5 99 Z 4 9
yeah like so Intel Intel skips they go
they go in 202 increments of 200 great
they went X 99 2x - nah - 99
and before that they went like x58 to
x79 whichever wasn't 200 but it was in
doubles there they went 50 to 70 to 99
right to decade 79 to 99 and then they
went to 99 they gotta be so now they
would need to jump to 499 right so you
have AMD with x3 99 and Intel with x4 99
and x2 99 and like a sandwich in between
and that's just talking about one line
of high-end desktops that's not even
getting into the b3 50s and three
sixties and x4 70s and z4 90s and z4 70s
and I need to figure out something that
said to just ignore can ignore all the
chips tech names and go buy slike socket
or color turquoise socket wouldn't that
be nice
just one word it's easy to remember each
more completely different than the last
indigo I just like why can't they go
with it I get back to two digits like
right or even have to be a number
doesn't even have to be a number they
can make it a word exactly the new Intel
jur chipset rainbow I'll be cool go with
the code names Jaguar they should have a
contest where people submit ideas for
the next chipset name that's not a
freaking number that sounds exactly like
their competitors sasquatch I want to
salute yeah chipset Sasquatch I think
and then they would like fuck us all
over and be like and here introducing
the new Sasquatch x69 tension number on
to the end cuz any would do they that's
what they would do any well came out
with a sasquatch chipset that AMD would
come out with a Bigfoot chipset they're
just diving in the mythical creatures or
something like that I try to do so much
look forward to what the future building
technology rounding out the ddr5 they
are still going to keep using the ddr4
2288 pin
so still the same number of pets but
because next-gen ddr5 DIMMs will have
two separate 32-bit io channels there
will be a number of differences when it
comes to overall module architecture the
Atlantic article goes further into
detail beyond that I'm not going to go
into that detail right now do it because
I want to give you guys some reason to
click on the articles in the video's
description
cool also I only only had a chance to
kind of briefly briefly look over it so
ddr5 is expected to overtake ddr4 and
become more prevalent by 2022
so availability to 2019 2020 so we're
actually looking for platforms to launch
that have ddr5 and but and and it'll
become more mainstream in like four
years
cool yeah yeah yeah so that's pretty
much all the prepared content that I
have right now so let's check out if
anyone has donated us money and asked us
questions yes starting with Scott Dell
bacardi six dollars and sixty six cents
thank you Scott cheers Cheers very much
teaching you can I empty glass
unacceptable MB sixty seven thirteen
dollars and thirty seven cents Paul I
have to know did Jo the editor finally
get his PI what time what PI to you Oh
Jo Jo you ping him in PI no Jo came over
and we did a bunch of work and I filmed
it and it should I did a grouch work
flog I posted earlier today ah
and Jo wanted pie he did not get pie
however he did get cookies so I do feel
like chocolate chip cookies homemade I
made them and he ate several of them
yesterday so you make a damn good cookie
I think doesn't doesn't your wife make
cookies as well or it is just you yeah I
mean they're almost as good as mine but
yeah yeah you know your cookies are very
good I was getting excited during
Christmas cuz Paul owed his wife like to
make cookies oh yeah I'm a year then we
make spritz cookie and then yeah we just
I just scarf them down even come and go
over on delicious but yes so Jo has not
gotten pie but he has gotten cookies and
I know that's gonna but thank you thank
you lenticular for your
they're 1337 donation Tom's Bream
Smith's 50 no region
Crona finally back welcome back Tom's uh
win will Kyle punishments that when will
Kyle punishments be back
what's bones use this money to buy some
wd-40 for Kyle's office doors and also
HTTP see Paul he's talking about the
punishments I believe that uh Fred Fred
Fred oh yeah yeah
Fred rant yeah would always sick of me
with like a hundred dollar donation and
he detached and haniv dare or punishment
for me to carry out which I gladly did
because it was a hundred dollars but he
hasn't been around lately I haven't seen
him around so maybe he just got bored of
me yeah I mean maybe it's just it's just
it's just the money really that's not
that's all that you're waiting for some
money to come through this is true it's
all I care about but guess when the
money returns tough yeah but we are
doing faceoff on Kyle's half of the show
no I'm sure there'll be a punishment
involved there indeed bazinga X ten
dollar donation to get safety glasses
next time you do woodwork
Kyle will get the same on his half for
no safety glasses while cutting the
grill shame on YouTube safety glass so I
have glasses grill and these are these
from what I've heard I mean obviously
they're not the same as safety glasses
certain things I would I would put
safety glasses over as well but glasses
do provide a base level of eye
protection minor even better than yours
because they're bigger yes guys even
more even more protective full covered
but yeah I'm visiting X I will I will I
I do I do try to do do best practices
when I'm doing stuff safety sir filming
it and showing people and everything so
I'll try to do my best anymore that I do
have some everyone got really mad at me
for not wearing goggles or protective
gear when I was Dremel encase mod that's
what he said
hello will get the same on his half for
no safety glasses without a moral that's
what he said I read it I didn't realize
that
listening to word I didn't know what
Grill he was talking about probably
talking about thought you're talking
about your teeth I was thinking a
barbecue grill I was like I haven't cut
any barbecues and I won't barbecue lose
Oden with five pounds any downside using
my laptop with a 1050 to run a 1440p
monitor also Paul what happened to Hiro
and being locked in the garage all right
I can tell that real quick no ends the
oven there's no downside to the 10:50 it
should be able to run a 1440p monitor no
problem if you're gaming on that at 1440
the 1050 will struggle so you know you
can change the output from the monitor
to the red to the from the laptop to the
monitor and lower it to 1080 and just
scale it up and still play just fine
so I'm get 1050 is a 1080p card at best
yeah if you want that if you're in India
for the resolution and having more space
to work with with like 2d stuff then
then yes if you want a game at 1440
you're only gonna be able to play really
lightweight games with a 1050 you'll
you'll you'll need more horsepower than
that sorry for here locked in the garage
so my garage is on a hinge and usually
when we leave it's closed my wife and I
went out to see a movie and stuff and
the garage door was not closed all the
way and this is a lesson that we learned
say garage like person door like the big
ass door like the garage door from the
house into the garage standard little
door so oh right so after my wife and I
left here went wandering around pushed
his way out into the garage and the door
closed behind him and then he got stuck
out there and here we've known since we
got him we got him from from from a
shelter up here and we've known he has
separation anxiety he's fine when we
leave them at home with him and nori
because they can kind of keep each other
company
but being separated from her out in the
garage and the door closed behind him
freaky freaked out so he scratched
inside of the door and he tried to get
out the back door too and we felt
horrible when we got home and it's one
of those lessons that you learn it's
like all right it's when another thing
we got to check that door every time
make sure that door is all the way
closed and he did he like wreck anything
as far as like training um I mean he
damaged the door back into the house and
he tore a hole in the drywall going out
going at the back oh wow beyond that
there wasn't any oh he he chewed the the
door knob handles as well oh wow dents
in the door knob handles I mean that dog
can seriously do some damage if he wants
so when we when we got him from the
shelter we he had already been returned
twice by two other families that had
tried to adopt him because of separation
stuff like they left for the day and
they you know had tried to leave him in
the backyard or something and he Tora I
don't know what happened but it's
probably tore through a wall or
something to try to get back he's a he's
a big cuddly teddy teddy bear but he
really likes his humans and being next
to them all the time okay yeah teddy
tiger five dollar donation
what's a good low-profile HTTP case for
rise into AP you know gaming but need to
transcode from the network on a
big-screen TV also and motherboard
suggestion Kyle oh yeah in win show pen
there we go is is a really good option
the fractal design no 202 something that
I've used in the past that works well
yeah those would be my two other options
does look too I like that little
intimate in case it did that build in
what is nice and with a low-profile
cooler you wouldn't need to modern right
correct
so very low profile like 48 millimeters
okay so you need a little profile cool
cooler to go along with it or you can
bust the Dremel out and do the do like
Hal did but either way all right $0.50
33 $10 donation hey love your content I
have a question for with you what music
do you use for your b-roll and montages
in your videos where can I find said
music we are both I'm gonna use rest
really quick go for it
we're both partnered with full screen
full screen has an agreement with you're
right that is a squeaky door full screen
has an agreement with epidemic sound so
all I know all of my music that I've
been using recently and I can't speak
for Kyle but I believe most of his music
as well it all comes from epidemic sound
so that's where we get them they have
various artists that contribute there
when you have an account you can use the
their their music in your videos I can't
say exactly which tracks you might be
asking about but you can go directly to
the epidemic sound website and just
start listening to the music so if you
wanna browse around stuff there
feel free to do so I hope that helps
okay
Trinity Sloan $5 donation do you think
we'll see in cell gets stuck playing
catch-up because of their failed 10
nanometer process with ambulance 7
nanometre and apple supposedly going 5
nano meter that's a good question
Trinity Intel has recently delayed their
10 nanometers stuff yet again to 2019 so
yeah it's it's really not looking that
good I I'm pretty surprised at how long
it's taken them to come around to
releasing products based on that or at
least to release products at scale on
that so it's a good question if it
really does hold them up that long then
we could look we could be looking at a
pretty significant sea change in the
market because AMD's been having a lot
of success recently and everything but
Intel also has a long history a lot of
money and they had theoretically they
have the resources to get it done we're
just gonna have to kind of wait and see
if they're able to but yeah it would be
interesting to see Intel suddenly in a
position of trying to catch up to AMD
and maybe even Apple but was a lot to
see Stephen Hill $20 Thank You Stephen
he said beer money and we will use that
for beer or other other things
I guess probably mostly beer laboum the
whale $5 you can always buy the Noctua
industrial or chrome exhibition if the
poo isn't for you just a buck or two
more late to the talk about Noctua so
that is the case I know what like there
in ff12 and everything so I'm not but
I'm not sure if this newest fan their
current their launching with an
industrial or chrome axon I hope they do
but maybe we can confirm that sometime
soon
Jabil $5 jagerbomb for you and two for
me I don't have any Jager yeah it's been
a while since I did a Jager Bomb maybe
we'll do a Jager Bomb on the next
episode sure with your $5 oh yeah there
we go
well if we do it when we're broadcasting
from my house I'll be more okay with
that wants to do it early on the show
yeah since I'll be driving Jager Bomb is
not for the faint of heart killer
Jason Christoph $9.99 $9.99 Paul during
a random moment today I wonder if you
ever said there goes my hero and
someone's response was watch MSE goes I
don't think we've actually need our
thoughts I don't think we've actually
made the connection between the Foo
Fighters song and and our dog but we
should have by this point or what about
see what about the Ricky Martin song
what I can be your hero baby no you
never really seem like heroes style for
some reason so much he's more of a
foo-foo fan but I mean a little possibly
or Mariah Carey maybe he's more you know
he's definitely Mariah Carey and a hero
lies in you
careful we're gonna get flagged for
content and my singing is just that
since that on point she's in chat holy
shit that's good son
hey wait um I will try to work that into
everyday conversation my wife loves puns
and so maybe I can pull that off somehow
Andrew Watley five dollars do you guys
got any used computers for sale one
trash another ones treasure still
dreaming a game on the PC Andrew we
usually it's very challenging for us to
sell PC parts yes put it that way so we
try to find other useful uses for them
and it's a constant challenge because
you do giveaway people get mad at you
because you're giving away stuff and if
you do and even if you sell something
like yeah you get money in return like
but if you sell it to people that you
kind of know or acquaintances then I
feel like it kind of sets a precedent of
like oh I that guy sells stuff for cheap
oh yeah just tell him or like tell you
know go to him all the time for anything
I need electronic wise and tell all my
friends like I've dealt with that in the
past really yeah I'll be nice and sell
this one thing because I don't really
need it ensure it's a win-win but then
like sometimes word gets out and like oh
shit all these people are asking me for
shit now and selling stuff even if it's
like low key Oh to the table like that
is it takes time and you know it's it's
time time that we usually don't have so
continue hoarding everything say if
you're looking for bargains on computer
parts I mean the used market is fun if
slightly dangerous and that's what makes
it fun that have any danger in there
Micro Center live on the edge by a CPU
at Micro Center don't get stabbed kids
all right last donation Gerald with 20
bucks Thank You gerald I need help
while fixing a buddy's PC and upgrading
him to an SSD during Windows 10
reinstallation it went into a boot cycle
won't allow me into the BIOS PSU is fine
CPU or motherboard bricked your thoughts
on what it could be that is an
interesting question so
two solutions for you because basically
you need to you need to get back into
the BIOS like great you need to go in
there make sure everything's set up
properly
make sure it's trying to go to the right
boot device you want to make sure that
you're loading your Windows 10
installation USB and UEFI mode and then
using that to install into the SSD one
thing I would do is try unplug every
drive that's not the drive that you're
installing Windows 10 - that's a good
failsafe and then to get into the BIOS
you're gonna have two options if you're
not booting into Windows alright if you
are booting into Windows there's a
window shutdown method you can do
advanced shutdown and you can tell it to
reboot into the end of the end of the
BIOS and there's more specific terms for
that that I don't remember what they are
but event shutdown advanced its advanced
shut down our event startup in Windows
10 and you can do that if you're not
booting into Windows 10 at all then you
basically you should do a clear CMOS so
yeah either the button or the jumper on
your motherboard and yeah I mean if it's
if it's if it first comes the worst
remove the battery remove the CPU and do
clear CMOS but you should be able to
just press a button or put the jump
around on the board and clear CMOS and
that should be get you back into the bus
all those things that Paul just
suggested do that when the systems off
yeah don't do it when the systems are
the system's off then you're really
screwed that's important Steve do that
once and the system was never the same
all right we have one final donation
that just came in from post-apocalyptic
Peter five dollar donation thank you
post-apocalyptic Peter loved the content
Paul you too man looking forward to
Paul's solar Hardware thank you Peter
these hello wall it's always going in on
Friday that's Powerball in there I'm
gonna do one more video covering the
installation and then it's probably not
gonna be for another month and a
half-ish after that that I can come back
and like be like right now I'm using it
because there's a anywhere from like one
to six weeks I'm gonna need to wait for
the approval process to happen for me to
actually turn the whole system on right
now I can't use any of that stuff but
but I do have a new roof now which is
that's kind of cool
all right uh-oh we get shoutouts we got
Johnson shoutouts Johnson's we're almost
at the one hour point Johnson's on that
at the one hour point so that's cool
yeah I just have I have three Johnson's
Alex B from Wisconsin got the zero
insertion force mug which is a bit it's
a very good mug 15 ounce mug holds lots
of lots of liquid thank you
and Johnson for you John E from Arizona
gets a Johnson got the key cap and the
sword fight gaming mouse pad set so
