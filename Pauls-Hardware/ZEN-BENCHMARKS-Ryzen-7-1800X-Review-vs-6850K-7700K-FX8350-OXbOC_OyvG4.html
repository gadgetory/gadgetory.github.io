excellent well it's been a while since I
had the opportunity to test a completely
new computing platform so I had to make
some tough decisions when it came to my
rise in benchmarks until I had about
three days to test the CPU since this
past week was kind of bookended by trips
to San Francisco that I made and I
wanted to show a range of comparison
systems against the new $500 AMD Rison 7
1800 X I do also have the 1700 and 1700
X but they arrived later in the week so
I'll be testing them in a follow-up
video now if you didn't already know the
1800 X's AMD's flagship 14 nanometer 8
core CPU with 16 threads via
simultaneous multi-threading 20 Meg's of
cash and 24 PCI Express gen3 lanes has a
base clock of 3.6 gigahertz and a turbo
of 4 gigahertz although mine ran my
grand gesture little bit fashioned that
out of the box with my gigabyte or ax
370 gaming 5 motherboard reisen CPUs
will fit in new socket and 4
motherboards with a variety of chipset
options with X 370 and be 350 chipset
variants providing overclocking support
since all Rison CPUs are multiplier
unlocked for overclocking I want to
focus this video on the benchmarks
rather than the specs that you guys
probably already know though so here's a
rundown of my three comparison systems
that I will be testing the 1800 X
against so my rise in testbed features
the r7 1800 X of course the Noctua and
HQ 12s special edition cooler 16 gigs of
Corsair Vengeance lvx memory running at
29 33 megahertz a gigabyte Horus a X 370
gaming 5 motherboard and the GT x 1080
founders Edition graphics card from
Nvidia to keep things fair I used 16
gigs of DDR 4 running at 29 33 and all
the test beds except for the am3+ 1 and
4 the CPU frequency I ran a slight 100
megahertz overclock which was actually
how the gigabyte board ran the r7 1800 X
out of the box that
or it was writings extended frequency
range feature kicking in but I was not
running with the system in Windows 10
high performance mode so I don't believe
that was enabled anyway the 1800 X ran
at 4.1 gigahertz on one or two cores and
3.7 gigahertz on all cores my FX 8350
system as shown in my build video for it
features an FX 8350 8 core cpu running
at 4.2 gigahertz boost with a cooler
master hyper 212 Evo cooler 16 gigs of
ddr3 2400 memory from g.skill and a
salut saver tooth 990 FX to play on
motherboard and also used the founders
edition GTX 1080 by 7700 K system is
none other than the classy RGB build so
I'll link that video if you want a full
parts list on the build itself it's got
an mg XT Kraken X 62 cooler ASUS Maximus
9 hero motherboard
16 gigs of g.skill ddr4 again a 29 33 I
did remove two of these six that you can
see shown here when I was doing the
testing and an asus strix GT X 1080 that
I under clocked to match the founders
edition GPU frequency the CPU was again
overclocked by 100 megahertz running at
4.5 gigahertz boost and finally the X 99
system was 268 50k was also featured at
a previous build video which I will link
to but it has a coarser h100 iv2 CPU
cooler Asus x99 deluxe 2 motherboard 16
gigs of DDR 4 in a quad channel
configuration this time 4 by 4 gigs but
also running at 29 33 and an EVGA GTX
1084 the wind that was also under
clocked to match the founders edition
frequency the 68 50k was also given that
100 megahertz OC bump as well running at
3.9 gigahertz turbo up from its 3.8
stock frequency of course I welcome your
feedback about my CPU clock speed
decisions as well down in the comments
but for now let's dive into the
benchmarks will start with Cinebench of
course this is our fifth being tested
with multi thread mode as well as single
thread mode and the 1800 X as shown in
the preview benchmarks by AMD cleaning
up here with the multi-threaded score of
15 84 of course thanks to it having 16
threads compared to 60 850 kada as 1270
100 K that has 8 FX 8350 that has 8
really really nice boost from the old
performance of the FX 8350 here although
when you switch over to single thread
you do see that intel does still have
the single thread instructions per clock
performance boost at least with the 7700
K and the skylake architecture 68 50 K
with Broadwell e is coming in just
behind but we will see that change with
further tests next is CPU mark overall
score here again sees the 1800 X
cleaning up with a score of fifteen
thousand six hundred and sixty three
sixty eight fifty K coming in second
7700 K coming in third and that FX 8350
barely able to get close well couldn't
quite break 10 K but then of course the
single thread score is once again tell
us the story that the instructions per
clock performance of the Intel CPUs is
still outpacing what we have with rise
in seven so single throats for of 2065
not quite keeping up with the 68 50 K
and definitely lagging behind the 7700 K
with its core of 2647
next up we have blender and this is just
doing the splash fishy cat render which
is available for download from the
blender website pretty quick render here
but we can see at the 1800 X with all of
its cores and all of its threads did a
pretty damn good job here coming in with
a score of about 36 seconds just over
that that is less than half of what the
X FX 8350 got so again showing where we
have come in the past 5 years when you
compare it to the old excavator CPU next
up let's look at handbrake I was using
it to re-encode one of my 4k videos it's
about a four gig file about 12 to 13
minute long video and coding it down to
1080 from 4k and here's a 1800 X wins
again the score of 8 minutes and 30
seconds lower is better here of course
and again just about half of the score
of the FX 8350 so impressive there and
also nice to see it again outperforming
v68 50k in the 7700 K again I think
thanks to all of the cores and threads
available Adobe Premiere Pro CC this was
again a 4k video render one of my own
video projects coming in a very very
tight race here between the 1800 X and
the 68 50k I will say
of just one second but the 1,800 X did
win one once again coming in a couple
minutes ahead of the 7700 K and again
just destroying the FX 8350 as it should
in case you're wondering this is about a
13 minute long project being rendered to
4k 30fps with 48 megabits per second
bitrate next up let's switch over into
gaming benchmarks and here is where I
want you guys to pay close attention
because gaming is important and a lot of
you I think are concerned about gaming
performance with Rison let's jump right
into it with synthetics we have a 3d
mark firestrike Ultra score overall 5000
for $2.99 for the 1800 X that's largely
and thanks I think to the physics core
18,857 just just blown out of the water
at once again with all of those course
threads 17,000 was what the 68 50k was
able to muster 14,000 was up to 7700 K I
was able to put out but bear in mind
this is a synthetic test we also have 3d
mark time supply which is a DirectX 12
test again the 1800 X wins with a score
of 7500 72 overall and again I think
that's largely in part to the CPU score
of 7500 43 which is a good thousand
points more than what the 68 50k was
able to achieve and we jump over to
real-world tests though the story does
change and I apologize I had a limited
amount of time to run gaming tests only
have two games that I ran GTA 5 instead
of 6 the GTA 5 just look at the numbers
here compared to 4k and 1080 now 4k we
see pretty similar numbers across the
board even the 8350 and that is because
at 4k we're seeing more of a GPU
bottleneck than a CPU bottleneck the GPU
is in outputting as many frame so it's
not given a CPU enough to work with
however when we jump to 1080 we see that
the Intel platforms are able to get the
1080 GT X 1080 graphics card to output
about 140 frames per second but the
1,800 X is about 15% slow or 118 frames
per second and this was repeatable this
isn't just a fluke benchmark of course
the 8350 showing that it's really really
not up to the task of keeping up with
the modern GT X 1080 only outputting
about 90 frames per second but yeah that
1800 X
performance is a bit of a concern let's
move to sieve six and this is in direct
x12 mode and this is a bit more of a CPU
intensive game depending on what test
you're running of course at 4k the
graphics score was sixty four point five
frames per second for the 1800 X again
coming in shy of what's the 68 50 in the
7700 K were able to produce getting 68
FPS and 71 FPS respectively not quite as
big of a gap as we saw with GTA 5 but
still they seen under 2 X lagging behind
in game performance 99 percentile I'm
going to be trying to include these
scores as much as possible for this for
the future but here again we saw not as
good at performance this is the 1% of
Solus frames and what their average
frame rate was and we saw 51 FPS for the
1,800 X whereas the other two Intel
platforms hits 54 and 56 frames per
second when we jump over to 1080 with 6
we see that gap widened even a little
bit more with 1,800 exiting 69 frames
per second whereas the 60 at 50 and 70
700k hit 85 and 78 of course still doing
great compared to a 350 but I think you
guys are more concerned about how it
performs against modern Intel CPUs in
this respect 99 percentile did a little
bit better with the 1800 X hitting 49.8
which did outperform the 68 50 and then
average turn time which is more of a CPU
based test but I think here still the
instructions per clock won out as we saw
the 7700 K outperforming hitting 18
point seven seconds average trend time
whereas 1800 X only hit 22 point two now
I do want to briefly now touch on
temperatures and power draw but please
take my numbers with a big ol grain of
salt
simply put my measurement methodology
was a bit shaky because most of the
temperature monitoring software that we
rely on isn't fully functional with
rising yet it's not reporting proper
numbers i-264 for example is just
completely wrong
so my power draw numbers as well a
little bit shaky since they're relying
on instantaneous and peak measurements
from my kilowatt power strip and I'm
going to be improving my power draw
technology here soon as well but that
said my motherboard thermal sensor that
I am am 90% sure
is reading from the CPU socket take the
1800 X's load temps at about 65 to 75
degrees Celsius under full load across
all cores and that is what the ambient
being about 19 to 20 degrees Celsius
here in my garage as for power draw I
saw sublet 300 watt peak power draw
across all tests with my rise in
platform that's pretty nice only hit 291
watts max which is pretty good still
about 20 to 30 watts more than the 7700
K based system but AMD in their
documentation wasn't really claiming
that it outperform the 7700 cake's more
is it they're bringing the performance
per watt back up in line with what Intel
currently has and I'd say for an 8 core
16 thread system that's a pretty good
results when it comes to power draw but
now it is conclusion time and it's a
little complicated on paper and in
practice the raw power of 16 threads is
undeniable for workstation tasks for
video editing and for transcoding and
I'm very glad that I have the FX 8350
benchmarks from that system back there
so we can see just how far AMD has come
in the past five years or so
IPC improvements have closed the
performance gap with Intel or at least
narrowed it to a much much smaller
margin in such a way that it's easy to
say that AMD has created a powerful and
much more affordable consumer solution
for home and professional desktop use
those gaming results are hard to swallow
though and even though I only ran a
couple gaming tests I have been in touch
with Steve from gamers Nexus who
verified that they saw gaming FPS
numbers lagging behind intel's current
cpus in a similar fashion across the
titles that they tested it's a
frustrating result that really puts the
brakes on wholeheartedly recommending
the 1800 X for anyone who is purely
building a system for PC gaming why the
gaming numbers are suffering with Rison
it's still not wholly known but it's
clear that single thread performance is
still king when it comes to gaming and
decisions made by AMD at the
microarchitecture level could be
limiting performance with certain
instruction sets for more in-depth
discussion though I highly encourage you
to check out the gamers Nexus coverage
of the rise and launch because Steve had
some very insightful thoughts on this
topic while you're at it look all over
the internet for a lots of coverage on
reg and because lord knows there's
tons and tons of places where AMD was
sending these processors out I am going
to spend a little bit of time this
morning to look at some articles find
the good ones and I'll post links to
those down in the description so there
you have it guys an exciting launch to
be sure but definitely tempered somewhat
by the less than stellar gaming
performance I was feeling that the less
expensive rise in CPUs like the 1700
will provide a better price to
performance for a gaming build and as
the dust settles from this launch and
more outlets publish their numbers I
think things will become more clear
especially when testing across a wide
range of different gaming titles in the
meantime here's one more reminder to
1700 and 1700 X have showed up and
though I did not have time to cover them
today I will be working on that like
immediately I'm also going to be doing
some overclocking of course as well so
