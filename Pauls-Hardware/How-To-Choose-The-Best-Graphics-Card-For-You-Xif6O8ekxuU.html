question what graphics card should i buy
which is understandable since the GPU is
often the most expensive part of a
gaming PC build even if you've already
decided on a specific GPU such as the
nvidia geforce gtx 1070 that i'm using
for my example today there might be five
or ten plus different versions of it
from different ad and board partners
like ZOTAC to choose from so here's how
you can narrow down those options to
choose the graphics card that's right
for you so let's assume that you've
figured out your total PC budget and
what GPU you want
since choosing between AMD and NVIDIA is
going to be a topic for another video
entirely I'm just going to figure it
with about a 400 to 450 dollar budget
for the graphics card the gtx 1070 is a
solid choice i used an msi gtx 1070 for
the monthly build i did in july i
consider that to be a very well balanced
system link is right up there i was
$1,200 total and the GPU in a gaming
system is usually going to be about 25
to 40% of the overall budget the good
news is that as long as you're
considering a single specific GPU from
either AMD or nvidia what doesn't matter
are the base specs that will not change
all gtx 1070 s whether they're from
ZOTAC err EVGA or asus or ms i use in
videos GP 104 pascal GPU beneath the
cooler with 1920 cuda cores 120 texture
units providing 6.5 teraflops of raw
computer performance you also get a
gigabytes of gddr5 memory but that is
where the consistency ends what does
matter and what can change significantly
from board to board is GPU memory
frequencies cooling performance noise
generation size aesthetics and those
little bonus extras that the
manufacturers might throw in from time
to time all these variations matter to
some degree but the nice thing is that
if you don't care about one particular
category like aesthetics for example you
can pretty much ignore it and focus on
the more important differences let's run
down each one speed or GPU frequency raw
performance should be number one on this
list but how much can this vary given
that we're talking about the same GPU
from board to board
well the GPUs that have a reference
design like the gtx 1070 founders
edition we have a starting off point
this is the frequency that nvidia has
decided every single 1070 GPU can run at
and if you want to learn more about
reference versus custom card designs you
can check
my video in the card linked in the top
right so the way I look at it is every
GPU has a minimum frequency which for
the gtx 1070 is one thousand five
hundred and six megahertz base clock
1683 boost clock then there is what I
call the reasonable overclocking range
which I usually determine by testing
myself or reading reviews online for the
gtx 1070 about 2 to 2.1 gigahertz
maximum boost is what most people can
expect now add in board manufactures
will tweak their designs in several ways
to give the impression that it might be
able to overclock better and hit the
upper end of that reasonable
overclocking range such as redesigning a
custom PCB and increasing the board's
available power delivery capabilities or
creating a massive cooler with more
heatsink surface area and additional
fans note how much bigger these otech
1070 amp is then the reference version
of the gtx 1070 but does this really
matter well it can keep your temps down
it could also mean that your card runs
quieter but if you're looking for more
raw performance you're going to have to
spend more on a binned GPU binning is
just sorting and when an add-in board
partner gets a batch of GPUs from Nvidia
it's common practice to test each one
first before plopping it onto a graphics
card PCB to determine what is known as
ASIC quality our ASIC quality means that
the GPU can maintain its operating
frequency using less voltage which
almost always means that it can run
stable at a higher frequency than
another otherwise identical GPU with
lower ASIC quality the upshot is that
unless you're buying a vintage GPU which
are usually flagship products with
special names like EVGA classified or
kingpin or MSI lightning you're gonna
get the normal GPU leftovers that remain
after all the highest ASIC quality chips
have been set aside EVGA even listed
variants as a 980ti kingpin last
generation by ASIC quality charging
upwards of $1,000 for card with a base
price of 650 dollars for the chips that
they know will have superior
overclocking performance in my opinion
you should just ignore these flagship
cards since they're mainly there for
people looking to break overclocking
records and a premium you pay does not
scale with the performance gains that
you'll get versus a non Bend GPU any GPU
frequency over those reference base
clock numbers mentioned earlier is
technically overclocking though and you
should decide if you want overclock your
GPU right up front
most add in board manufacturers have
software to let you overclock the zotac
called firestorm by simply having a 200
megahertz positive offset to the GPU
clock on this card I was able to
overclock to about a 2 gigahertz boost
clock and it actually ran at twenty
fifty to twenty seventy-five megahertz
during testing this is a good overclock
but also nothing special compared to
other GTX and 70s that I've tried
including the lowly founders Edition
even with the big cooler the extra eight
pin power delivery sexy carbon-fiber
accents and all the determining factor
for this 1070 amp overclock was the luck
of the draw with the GPUs ASIC quality
more than anything else all this is to
say that with the majority of GTX 10 70s
or any specific GPU that you're looking
at you're better looking at other
factors to decide which one to buy out
of the box than just frequency alone
that is if you're okay to manually
overclock if you don't want to overclock
though and there's nothing wrong with
that not everyone likes to do it
definitely check those default speeds
out of the box 1070 ampere runs at 1797
boosts clock compared to the reference
design 1683 for example that's over 100
megahertz manufacturer overclock that'll
get you more performance out of the box
and you will never need to load up the
manual control software that's not to
say that these large coolers are useless
though and cooling is important
especially over long play sessions if
your gtx 1070 gets hotter than 83
degrees celsius it will reduce the
operating frequency which will also
reduce performance so fortunately this
big cooler never allowed my GPU to get
above 72 degrees Celsius also that
cooling efficiency means that the fans
don't need to work as hard under max low
the zotac 1070 amp never had to push the
fans beyond 40% speed to keep the
temperatures under control so the card
was basically silent unless I put my ear
like right up next to it and the silent
running card is a very desirable selling
point also when it's not using any of
power doesn't even spend fans up so
that's nice too those are the most
practical considerations for choosing a
specific third-party graphics card
design but there are other things to
take into account as well with a custom
PCB you might consider water cooling in
the future so custom PCBs need custom
water blocks you may or may not have one
available from a manufacturer like ek so
for that reason you might want to go
with a reference style PCB the boards
can also be bigger though and the cooler
size can also increase so having room in
your case is a very important consider
having a long GPU can conflict with
drive bass and having a two slots or
even three slot sized cooler can block
expansion slots you might also consider
the cards design and aesthetics
especially if your case has a side panel
window and you want to get all
matchy-matchy and stuff colors or lack
thereof are either the least important
thing on your list or the most important
I guess depending on how much of a
visual person you are the yellow accents
trip on this card's backplate for
example is a make-or-break aesthetic
choice it would work perfectly and a
yellow accented build that would stand
out horribly and other color schemes
if color coordination is important to
you consider this carefully as otherwise
you might have to resort to modding or
painting things to work which while fun
can void your warranty lighting is also
the new rage in GPUs and motherboards
now - there's RGB LEDs on the zotac logo
and the accents on the shroud of the
1070 amp you can control them with the
firestorm software just make sure that
your GPUs LEDs will match with your
build if they're a static color or
double check they can be disabled or
controlled with software if your stall
defense in your GPU buying decision
consider these extras a backplate like
the nicely designed wraparound job on
the zotac amp is largely an aesthetic
addition but often considered quite
valuable as an upgrade since it is
usually very visible in your case
accessories for GPUs are often pretty
minimal but some packages like the one
that came with the gigabyte GT X 1080
extreme that I reviewed a few weeks back
can provide some compelling add-ons like
a high bandwidth sli bridge and front
panel hdmi ports for VR free games are
common additions to keep an out for as
well especially if it's a game that you
already planned on purchasing although
those promos tend to come and go also a
good warranty can provide some peace of
mind ZOTAC provides a two-year warranty
which is extendable to three if you
register your card and finally mail-in
rebates can help save on pricing as long
as you remember to mail them in of
course
so what graphics card is right for you
well that depends on you your budget
your build and your personal tastes but
as long as you don't mind the yellow I
think so Tech has built a very nice gtx
1070 in their amp edition right here so
check the description down below for a
