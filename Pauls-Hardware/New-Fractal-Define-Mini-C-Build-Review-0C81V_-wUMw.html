what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is going to be a
quick review and a quick build in this
new case from fractal design the define
mini see this is a micro ATX case and at
first glance you might think well that
looks exactly like the define s or the
define r5 so exterior yeah you probably
get that but interior fractal has done
some updates they've made some changes
that I actually really like they've
included like a shroud now for the power
supply and that kind of thing in this
case at least in this size is going to
be selling for $79.99 US dollars for the
windowed version here and there's also a
non windowed version that has sound
dampening material as this entire case
does throughout that's coming in at
$74.99 now you might have noticed that I
already built the system in here so why
do we jump back to last night for a
quick rundown of the new features so I
took a first look at the define mini C
and I thought wow it's a define s or may
define our v just a micro ATX version
which would be pretty cool in and of
itself but there's actually some updates
that they've done that are quite nice I
have to take the side panels off to see
that first though but just to round out
features steel construction plexi side
panel two USB 3.0 on the front mic and
headphone a plastic faux brushed
aluminum cover right up there in the
front and I've already loosened these
thumb screws captured thumb screws by
the way ammaji vent pan along the top
that you can pop off if you want to add
like an exhaust there or radiator
support it can support a 240 millimeter
rat up front does come with a sorry kind
of blown out magnetic dust filter that
you can pop on up there which means you
have dust filters for pretty much
everywhere top front has a removable one
I'll show you in a sec as well as the
bottom one that you can pop off down
here I can get a hold of it like so
voila and that covers the entire bottom
of the case going all the way back to
the power supply finally on the outside
there's a removable panel here for the
power supply or like a power supply
bracket you can remove with thumb screws
so you can flip it if you want that's
possible
that's not good don't worry it survived
okay so the biggest changes here is
probably going to be this lovely bottom
area here that's kind of blocked off a
power supply cage or cover or whatever
you might want to call it there's a
little bit of detail there in the
fractal logo the touch x-gen to the side
and there is some ventilation on top of
that too which is pretty nice it does
mean that you could put your power
supply fan up I guess if you really
wanted to miss the airflow worked out
other than that a pretty standard lay
out interior for micro ATX build 120
millimeter fan at the back and 120
millimeter fan included at the front
back does have a little slighty points
right there so you can slide that up and
down if you want to and then on the
front you actually do have support or a
few different radiator types actually
what you can do is remove this panel
just this part of this cage and that's
actually really cool that it's fans a
lot gives you full access to the front
area for mounting of radiators of fans
so you might have already noticed
grommeted covers for all your pastures
for cables and then for drive mounts you
have a three SSD mount here which you
can remove so you have to remove the
whole thing to mount the SSDs from the
other side with screws but you can't fit
three there all next to each other I
don't know if that's going to cause any
like extra heat for since it's going to
be right behind where your CPU would be
but it seems at least like a good use of
space also lots of cable type tie-down
points back here and then this sort of
channel where most of your cables are
going to run as you bring them up here
for like a 24 pin and cables for
graphics cards you do have to drive
mounts down here at the very bottom on
little cages with the whites accents as
fractal is known for and then you know
rubber feet for the power supply mount
and that kind of thing I popped off the
front panel so we can get at this last
dust filter it's not meant to be removed
with one hand
huh hold on okay I got it alright so
that shows the mounting area here at the
front where you can do it looks like and
again I haven't read the manual or any
of the documents so maybe I'll correct
myself later on but it looks like I can
do 360 or even at least - bye bye - bye
bye 140 here so um that's a 280 yeah it
looks like maybe a 360 or a 280 good fit
here because even though at the bottom
here you don't really have much intake
for those those hard drives which is
actually my one concern about this case
its airflow for the hard drives you can
push that cage over it is on Rails so
you can slide it this way depending on
how large your power supply is over here
and possibly give yourself room to keep
that cage there and have like radiators
and fans mounted up here at the front if
you remove this piece right here which
just has a couple screws right there
that you can pop out to remove it and
again that gives you I guess a little
bit more airflow from the top to the
bottom as well as again space right
there for vertical stuff like radiators
and fans although I will point out that
when you put fans on this side of this
panel you do lose the ability to use
this dust filter alright so the system
on the left there is my htpc it's in a
fractal node 805 and I know 804 I'm
sorry and I'm going to transfer that
system into the define mini C for a few
reasons mainly I want to clean it and
it's very dusty also I think I should
get rid of the stock heatsink fan
you
so thankfully I was able to clean all
the dust out of the HDTV see build that
stays on like 24/7 which is why it was
so freakin dusty in there however I
would like to point out that I have a
couple items in this system that don't
run the fans for instance the power
supply down here it's a big overkill I
will admit for the system in RM 850 i
from corsair fan doesn't spin up unless
it uses a more juice and that fan I
don't think was running at all because
there was no dust on the filter down
there also the zotac video card won't
spin the fan of unless it's being used
so that's cool too but you know what I
haven't actually done yet is turn this
this darn thing on so I'm gonna remove
the side panel here and hope that
nothing goes terribly wrong and flip the
switch and hit the power button I flip
the switch the wrong way
oh there it goes I don't know why I
don't know why I had to hit the switch
twice so it works cool and honestly the
thing that I can hear the most right now
is the mechanical hard drive down there
in the bottom but it is an 8 terabyte
drive so I don't think that's going
anywhere anytime soon other than that
this thing's really quiet fans are just
not spinning up of course I have no idea
what's going on in the background and
this system is booting into Windows 7
right now but let's talk about some of
the things I liked about this case like
the design updates for sure like the
shroud down here at the bottom that
gives you a lot more flexibility with
different power supplies you might be
able to purchase you go with a really
budget power supply get 80 plus bronze
and get a decent manufacturer of course
always and then even if you have ugly
cabling down there you can get some
extensions or something to make things
look prettier here up top speak of
things looking pretty since this is an
HTTP see I wasn't really going for the
whole aesthetic thing overall but still
doesn't look too bad I did try to keep
the cable management as tight as I could
and I will say that just like the
defined nan OS the grommet position for
these pass throughs here for the cable
management position are really well
placed very easy to get to and I was
able to just kind of poke the the cables
out there and plug them in where they
were necessary and everything everything
worked out just fine I also like the
fractal has now given you dust filters
for pretty much everywhere on the case
except the exhaust right back here but
that typically wouldn't need a dust
filter it has been lacking the top dust
filter and it's magnetized and
everything you would want to take it out
of the plastic bag before you actually
use it but that will keep dust that you
know that'll that will make it much
easier though to clean off dust that
might fall down on top of your case if
you remove that module bent top cover
and put a radiator or something like
that in there other than that what else
do I like I like the side window I like
the little fractal design etching here a
little bit of branding there but it
doesn't stand out too bad and then I
like micro ATX in general and I thought
this was a good example of a system to
put in this case simply because I'm
taking advantage of some of the
expansion that's available so whereas
what's mini ITX build you could only do
like a graphics card I also have my seat
and infinite TV capture card down there
which I use
to get over-the-air well not
over-the-air cable broadcasts which are
all recorded to a terabyte drive and
this has been a very effective HTPC for
me for a little while so I'm happy to
continue using it in its present state
now other were a couple cons that I
noticed that going through the build one
and this is purely for my purposes of
using this as an HTP see a windowed side
panel probably wouldn't have been the
best choice I probably if I was really
using this for an HTTP see build would
have gone for the solid side panel it
has a little bit more sound dampening on
there although again it's really quiet
the other thing it's kind of missing and
this is again very specifically for an
HTTP see I realized after I put the
build together is I don't have my
blu-ray drive in there anymore the note
804 has a tucked away little blu-ray
drive thing that's in the front that's
kind of speculating maybe I could hack
the front of this case up somehow and
still put that blu-ray drive in there to
get that I don't know we'll see we'll
see that's maybe a possibility the other
thing and this was probably my most
legitimate complaint although I haven't
had the chance to test it is that you've
got to drive cages down here right at
the front they're kind of enclosed by
that shroud and there's no direct fan
blowing air across them so if I was
really stacking like a couple 3.5 inch
drives in there I would be a little bit
concerned I want to keep an eye on their
temperatures simply because they aren't
getting active airflow and if your power
supply is back here there's really
nothing pushing air through there and
then that's also where a lot of the
cable management happens so just try to
keep things clear down there I guess is
what I would be saying especially if
you're using some mechanical drives that
might get warm
because mechanical drives can get pretty
stinking warm the last complaint I can
think of and this is really kind of
reaching but I was comparing this to
like what NVIDIA has been doing with
their reference design or Founders
edition graphics cards for a while
they've kind of stuck with a very
similar design for them and that
fractals has been doing the same thing
now granted it served them pretty well
and if you go back from like the define
like the r4 and r5 up to the define asks
and other variations that they've made
on it it's obviously an appealing design
because it is scandinavian minimalism
and all that good stuff but I would say
that it'd be nice to see frak what kind
of branch out a little bit maybe maybe
do something a little bit more dangerous
or something a little bit more out there
granted everyone would probably hate it
but you know it would at least be
something different anyway
the good things though are the radiator
support I love that you can fit a 240 in
the top as well as up to a 360 in the
front or a 280 in the front I really
liked that they added that extra panel
here you can remove from the power
supply shot so you can still access
those front areas while still giving you
access to the drive bays down there and
the ability to ship those so you could
even have the drive bays and radiator I
will say if you're considering really
packing out this lower section down here
get a small power supply the silverstone
power supply that I used on the my
wife's build the hot box build is very
short it's only 140 hundred 50
millimeters long I think that will give
you a lot more room down here especially
if you're planning on putting radiators
and fans up in the front that will push
that cage back or if you're not going to
use that cage you've got three SSD
mounts up there at the back too so you
know you could completely go without
that cage as well and I'm imagining that
there's going to be people doing
water-cooled systems in here whether
remove that panel put the rads up front
and maybe have like a reservoir sticking
up out of there something like that who
knows the possibilities are endless but
guys it's gonna wrap it up for this
video once again this has been the
fractal design define mini C I'm told
this is also going to be available in
different sizes so I recommend going to
Kyle's channel as well as the other tech
youtubers cuz I have a feeling there
might be a few other people with videos
out on the different variations of this
case the fractal is launching right now
just in that time for the holidays at 80
dollars and 75 dollars respectively
again at least for this model hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video leave comments in the comment
section let me know what you want to
comment about also links down there to
my store where you can buy shirts and
mugs pint glasses also some new winter
gear down there so check it out right
now thanks for watching guys and we'll
see you next time yeah it works just
like it did before sweet okay I have one
more complaint about this case fractal
if you're listening make the LED white
please light LED and of against blue but
white just matches a lot better</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
