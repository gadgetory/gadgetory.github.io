hello everyone and welcome to Pauls
hardware today's video is about our GB
and has RGB gone too far this is a part
1 video so there will be a second part
coming up and I have this entire build a
rage here in front of me I'm gonna put
this together today but I'm a little sad
about it I'm a little torn I'm not
exactly sure what to do because ever
since MSI launched their godlike gaming
motherboard back in like 2015 or
whenever that was RGB has been
everywhere you can't really escape it
when it comes to building a gaming PC
and so I am fully embracing it with this
build this is over-the-top
RGB just about everything has some RGB
elements involved except maybe the power
supply because I have to maintain my
dignity somehow but I'm gonna assemble
us together we're gonna take a closer
look at teams t force delta r gb SSD
adding to the list of RGB things you can
have in your computer and once i get
this all put together i would like you
guys to let me know in the comments
whether you think RGB is awesome
or it sucks or if you just don't care
that said this is also a pretty powerful
gaming pc when it comes to the core
components we've got a 2700 X as well as
the Vegas 64 graphics card so let's take
a closer look at what's actually gonna
be installed in the cooler master H 500
P white so the case is the H 500 P white
as just mentioned it's got the mesh in
the front so it's actually got good
airflow the redesign of this case has
been getting really good reviews so I'm
excited to be building in it and the
white finish should provide a lot of
reflective cover for all of our RGB
stuff 2700 X is the CPU this is pretty
much the highest end CPU that AMD has on
their mainstream platform that's a core
16 thread processor and it will boost
itself up to like 4.2 + gigahertz on a
couple cores so very nice CPU crossfire
7 hero motherboard from asus is going to
be the core of our system and i needed
something that had
possible digital RGB header on it as
well as the ASIS or a software which
will combine with like the graphics card
and I believe our master liquid stuff is
also compatible with it can I double
check on that yes it is
got the Aces or a sync support graphics
card just sticking with AMD theme is the
RX Vega 64 also from Asus also
compatible with the entire RGB ecosystem
that we're going for here and then of
course kind of the the source of this
build the reason why I'm putting it
together and showing you the RGB
everything is that team recently since
over this night hot kit of RGB memory
also or a compatible really cool RGB
element designs on the top of the dims
and a nice flavor difference from the
g.skill RGB stuff that I've been using
for quite some time and then of course
the tea force Delta an RGB SSD did you
guys think this was a necessary thing
I'm not sure I'm still waiting on your
feedback but I'll install it and show
you guys how it looks rounding things
out we got a 750 watt 80 plus gold rated
EVGA supernova power supply solid power
supply and I've got the black cabling
kit for that as well which is nice and
then for our cooler the master liquid ML
240 our RGB with RGB on the block pump
RGB on the fans and since I've got this
master fan expansion kit I might even go
push-pull on that since I've got some
extra hundred twenty millimeter RGB fans
so they are the parts I want to get this
put together and then I will show you
guys the end results let's get started
I'm sorry I gave that to him too as a
gift
oh my god how did that I did not know
how it's a DK there's an 8 - 51 type 3
class a solid state it's fine Joe knows
it to be dissected later on I try to
catch it
I'm sorry I really just lining up the
CPU and the cooler mount right here and
noticing if we position it this way the
tubing comes out on this side and it
might still fit but some potential
clearance issues with the RAM there and
I can flip it this way but then our
logos upside down so I have just
discovered on this new cooler master on
one yeah look at that it just slips off
sweet it's got four little brackets in
there so you can rotate it 90 degrees
180 degrees or or opposite the same
rotation Thank You Coolermaster I'd like
this feature on your all-in-one liquid
cooler
so I'm feeling pretty silly right now
because I completely ignored the fact
that this case has a very convenient
feature for installing a CPU cooler a
liquid cooler like this one which is
that the entire top bracket for it comes
off so you can mount everything outside
the case and have a much easier time
we're in the homestretch here guys but I
have noticed that I have a bunch of
little three pin digital RGB leads
coming at the back of the case from all
the fans and stuff Coolermaster has
included this little piece right here so
this has some built-in controls on it so
you can control the RGB LEDs or if you
have a motherboard that you want to use
and use this as a splitter it's got
inputs over here so 12 volts and the 3
pin for digital control so this is the
older-style plug this is a newer style
plug feed these ever from your
motherboard and then it will feed your
mother Berg controls through to this
means you have to be plugged to and we
got a bunch of three pin connection
points on the sides there we've got some
other leads here you can actually use
this to pass through your front panel
connectors I'm not doing that today but
and then a few more connection points on
the side powered by Sita so guys at this
point all the hardware is pretty much
installed in the case and what I'm
realizing is that I have seven different
digitally controlled RGB devices for
fans at the top one more at the back
makes five the control for the pump in
the middle has a digital control that
makes six and then seven for our team t
force Delta down here we've also got
these two front fans but those are just
using the four pin control rather than
the three pin so I've just taken those
they're on a splitter and I plugged that
directly into the motherboard so a good
day I'm actually really happy you chose
this motherboard from Asus because it
has two digital outputs the three pins
for RGB control and it also has two non
digital outputs for RGB control the four
pin ones so I have an extra four pin
still so that's good I'm going to need
to take one of those digital outs and
plug one of these devices in directly I
can plug three of them into this and
then I'll need to use the fourth output
on this to work as an input on this
little guy and this little guy came
along
with the liquid cooler this is just
another little mini control device
doesn't control quite as many devices
but it does have a splitter so it
controls three so that'll let me do 3
plus 3 6 of 7 and then the seventh I can
plug directly into that final 3 pin out
on the motherboard
it's a magnet oh I like that
let's get a magnet it's a magnet some
mega - hey good job Coolermaster good
thinking
well okay guys I now have a built
computer here next to me with RGB LEDs
wired up
I've only wired up the control unit at
the back right now so I can turn the
system on and give you guys a bit of a
light show since I guess that's kind of
the underlying theme of this whole video
of course I will be able to wire this up
to the motherboard once I get the
operating system installed but for now
let's flip this switch and we have a
power button let there be light waiting
to say that so guys here's a look at my
completed build with many many RGB s
going on everywhere and I think this
looks pretty sweet although of course I
am
providing this for your feedback to let
me know if you think RGB has actually
gone too far these days yeah I'm not
even taking it as far as I'm going to I
have a follow-up video planned for this
one and I have something special I think
I'm gonna be able to show you when that
comes about but for now we have the two
large 200 millimeter RGB fans at the
front providing intake and those are
good fans they're nice and quiet they
move lots of air those are not
addressable RGB so so you can see the
entire fans kind of shift color from one
to the next as opposed to the
addressable RGB fans with hebt which
have individual RGB s that can change
different colors which is why the
different parts of the fan blades there
are different colors there's also
addressable RGB in the Coolermaster pump
there at the center I like the look at
this of this it's a little bit more
subtle and you can just sort of see the
RGB behind there which shines through at
the edges a little bit steam night hot
kit of RGB memory this is my first time
using this I like the defaults out of
the box
flashy dance that it does kind of gives
you a little little light show there
that's pretty cool and since the top
fans for the master liquid ml 240 our
RGB are the same as the one in the back
they're gonna look pretty much the same
I was barely able to fit this push-pull
configuration in here in case anyone was
wondering if this is gonna fit I did
have to put a little bit of pressure on
the top of the motherboard on one of the
heat sinks but it did fit in there
without too much difficulty here's a
look at the exhaust for those two fans
on the top there is a plastic piece
right here but there's a decent amount
of space there and I can actually feel
the air coming out on the sides right
here from those fans so they are getting
some decent amount of airflow there and
finally the team t force delta SSD
if you're gonna invest in an SSD with
RGB lighting you definitely want a case
that can display that the only thing I'm
wishing I had here was the second one
because this case has two nicely
positioned SSD trays again a little bit
of a crimped spacing issue back there
depending on the front panel connectors
you're gonna plug in to the motherboard
but I think this looks pretty nice
definitely stand out a lot more you can
have a lot more people being like hey
what SSD is that but for a case like the
H 500 P where you can have it here or
like some NZXT cases that allow you to
position it right here I think that's a
pretty cool device of course though it's
up to you guys to tell me how cool you
actually think it is and finally I have
reinstalled the tempered glass side
panel to give you guys the completed
look and I have to admit I was a little
skeptical about this build when I
started out earlier today I was like I
want to make an all RGB system now that
it's all put together I think it
actually looks pretty cool but let me
know what you guys think in the comments
