Paul's hardware today's video is
definitely a different type of video
because I'm gonna be talking all day
today well all for the next maybe 10 or
20 minutes about net neutrality net
neutrality is something that's I feel
very strongly about and it's something
that not everyone is completely familiar
with there's some important stuff going
on in the US government right now with
regards to net neutrality and how
internet service providers can treat the
data that you get at home through your
internet connection whether that's
provided through a larger net service
provider like Comcast or Verizon or Time
Warner spectrum or whether you have a
small Internet service provider or
whether you're lucky enough to have
Google Fiber but I'm joined today by
none other than Wendell from level one
techs how's it going Wendell how are you
thanks for having me I'm doing great
thank you so much for being here
I brought Wendell in because he's very
smart he knows a lot about this subject
and although there are of course areas
where both of us are not completely
familiar we have done a ton of research
to give you guys a lot of feedback on
this topic to hopefully give you guys a
quick rundown of how it's actually going
to work and then we're also going to do
a follow-up video to this one on my
channel Paul's Hardware we're gonna post
links in the video description to the
level 1 text video where Wendell and I
are gonna take a lot more time to go
into more depth about a lot of these
topics talk about some specific
scenarios and that kind of thing so if
you're not familiar with net neutrality
or if you know someone who isn't
familiar and you want to share some
information with them that you feel is
good hopefully that's what we're going
to be bringing you right now but let's
start off from the very basics and what
is net neutrality from the starts from
my understanding you have a connection
to the internet again provided by your
internet service provider and packets of
data go to and fro on that you might be
connecting to a server that's across the
town across your state across the
country or around the world that's the
basis of the world wide web you can go
out on the internet you can browse the
public internet and you can access it
you can load it up on your computer you
can interact with it however you want
net neutrality is the basic premise
that's the packets of data being sent to
and from your computer
are treated equally regardless of where
they might originate from elsewhere on
the Internet's that is currently upheld
by what is called title 2 that allows
the FCC to enforce net neutrality so
let's do a follow up question and what
is title 2 and Wendell maybe you can
chime in here about this one and give a
quick rundown of what title 2 is title 2
is a section of the 96th
Telecommunications Act which is sort of
the amendment and replacement of the
1934 Telecommunications Act that talks
about what are called common carriers
you know the Institute is a thing about
it in sort of technological terms but
common carrier thinking about like like
riding the bus or getting from point A
to point B a common carrier is it's
gonna shuttle your data from A to B it
doesn't really care what the data is it
doesn't really care about anything like
that
telephone that's like I'm gonna pick up
the phone and I'm gonna call you know
Bob three states over it's gonna be a
long-distance call the companies there's
more than one company involved with that
obviously and the companies that are
carrying that phone call can be said to
be common carriers they don't need to be
concerned with the content you know if
you and Bob are planning a bank robbery
or whatever the content of your call
just doesn't concern the company they're
a common carrier they're absolved in
legal liability there they're just
carrying the communication and so ISPs
are now classified as you know sort of
title 2 communications providers meaning
that they provide the infrastructure
necessary for communications and they
don't interfere with or concern
themselves with the contents of that
communication now our stance based on
our discussion leading up to this video
is that net neutrality is a good thing
and if you look at it from sort of just
the basic idea of what it actually is
and as Wendell is described just now
your data going to and fro the or the
data of the website you're trying to
access should just be since one from one
point to the other and of course bounce
through the Internet's to get where it's
going to go the enforcement of net
neutrality or the ability for a
government agency to say to your
internet service provider hey you need
to treat the data in this way is
currently upheld by the fact that we
have title to classification of
Internet service providers as common
carriers now there are other ways
potentially that net neutrality could be
enforced and the the best theoretical
alternative is simply via competition so
that idea is that well you could have
net neutrality if you have a bunch of
different different internet service
providers if one internet service
provider says hey I'm going to give you
access to the entire internet for this
base price that's what you get
you'll probably be pretty happy with
that if you have another another
internet service provider who says
here's your cost for your Internet's and
then hey if you want to access Netflix
we're going to charge you an extra 10
bucks if you want to access this website
we're going to charge you an extra fee
for that if you want to access services
for apps or that kind of thing they
might add it a net additional fee for
that that isn't allowed with the current
titles new classification but it could
potentially be allowed if Internet
service providers were not classified as
common carriers under title 2 if they
move them to title 1 for example which
is how they were classified briefly and
again in our lengthy or follow up video
to this we're going to go into a bit
more of the history of that but our
stance is that net neutrality is good
however it's enforced but the way the
Internet is currently deployed in the
United States right now is such that
most people actually don't have
competition so in the absence of being
able to enforce net neutrality through
natural competition and choice between
Internet service providers one which
might treat your data the way you want
to one which might throttle it or slow
it down when you're accessing different
web sites data I think unnecessarily
complicates things in most people's
minds think about like the water company
or the power company and it's like I
there needs to be three competing power
companies in my area to provide
electricity so that we get the best most
capitalistic way of doing that it's like
no I don't I don't think that makes
logical sense three competing power
companies would probably all have
inferior infrastructure to one properly
want run power company in an area
supplying electricity to that area it's
kind of the same way with the local
network infrastructure but not
necessarily the internet connection
itself and so this this is kind of thing
is called a natural monopoly and so like
your telecommunication stuff there kind
of is a natural monopoly to provide that
and think about like your
Abell TV provider in the telephone
company like what historically were two
different services both bringing a
copper line to your house now you can do
the same cuz everything is digital you
can do the same kind of thing over
either connection so you've already got
a little bit of redundancy in your in
your infrastructure if you're fortunate
enough to be in an area with two
different providers but most of these
companies have conglomerated to the
point that there's not really a lot of
overlap in in competition in in a given
geographical area so in the absence of
competition our stance is that title two
is the proper way to enforce net
neutrality right now the FCC however
currently has what is called a notice of
proposed rulemaking going on they're
calling it restoring Internet freedom
and they're going to be voting on it on
December 14th and about well about a
week and a half
basically the expectation is that the
FCC is going to vote along party lines
Republicans versus Democrat we don't
like to phrase this as a political issue
however that's how it's falling out
right now unfortunately there might be
people who lean left or right when it
comes to the political spectrum who
might get an idea of how they feel about
this based on their political leanings
rather than the facts but that's why
we're trying to bring you guys more
facts today we're going to do this with
a little bit of structure and that's I
happen to follow a few of the members of
the FCC on Twitter
Brendan Carr tweeted this out just last
week and he posted a piece intended to
debunk what he calls the babble of other
misinformation this is actually posted
directly to the FCC website all the
articles that were talking about today
by the way are linked in this video's
description so check them out there this
is a list of the net neutrality myths
according to the FCC and his response
and what He is calling facts that
counter each of those myths we're gonna
go down this list point four points and
we're gonna show you why we feel you're
very much being misled by this document
in particular and why we feel like the
FCC's actions they're about to take are
misguided and that they should probably
do things a little bit differently it's
so hard not to wax poetic
a great link but we're gonna keep it
short for you guys that's the goal I
don't know I don't know how long this
intro has been so far but let's let's
let's plow through a most start off with
the first one the general myth this is
the end of the Internet as we know it's
and of course there's been lots of
discussion online because lots of people
like the internet so people are
rightfully upset and angry that the
internet might change or especially that
they might somehow need to pay more for
the Internet
that's really what it boils down to a
lot of it how much the internet costs
and how much people are gonna have to
pay for it
now the statement made here is that the
internet was free and open before the
Obama administration's 2015 heavy-handed
Title 2 internet regulations a phrase
that's repeated often and very often
they can't seem to to list these as
title 2 regulations without referring it
to its full title the Obama
administration's 2015 heavy-handed title
to Internet regulations but that
language aside first off if you look at
what the Internet service providers are
trying to do they've indicated in the
past that they're somewhat excited for
net neutrality rules to go away and in
fact when it comes to court proceedings
they've specifically stated that they're
intending to do segmentation and to
favor some perverts preferred services
content or sites over others not only
that but there's the potential
introduction of legislation to prohibit
States from enforcing net neutrality so
if you're a states rights kind of person
they didn't like the feds coming in and
telling you what to do but you do like
net neutrality they might be going in
and telling your state that by the way
we have decided that net neutrality
shouldn't be a thing therefore you
cannot decide that as a state either
which doesn't seem necessarily right to
me yes right yeah I don't know there's
also a lot of history going on here and
again there's been several court cases
regarding this where internet service
providers have had to go in and had to
make statements in court which when you
make a statement in court you kind of
have to tell the truth otherwise it's
kind of a big deal so there are some
additional documentation zamora links
about prior to 2014
when real when Tom wheeler the previous
FCC Chairman reclassified title one to
title to the article on the verge
specifically talks about the death of
the internet how the FCC lost net
neutrality and could kill the internet
but Wendell did you did you have
something to comment on about this one
that was that The Verge articles
actually before wheeler reclassified
them and so it's it's kind it's almost a
little bit of foreshadowing because it
talks about how all this wasn't you know
classified right this doesn't have the
thing and that and that kind of makes
sense you have to understand that before
they were title to they really were
title one they that is not the every
great lie has a little has a little bit
of truth in it and this is the same
thing in this guy's response and so he's
just saying well you know it did really
well under title one but the whole
reason the wheeler felt that he had to
reclassify the Taiwan to title two it
was because of specific cases of
shenanigans that we're gonna talk about
but you also say in the the 2013 case
where the FCC and Verizon were having an
argument over exactly this not being
free and open and treating things equal
that the actual quote says I'm
authorized to state for my client today
but for but for these rules we would be
exploring those types of arrangements
meaning the whole you know the
destination pays which is not a good
thing so the judge asked very directly
do you plan to treat certain Internet
traffic differently from others and
their answer was yes absolutely we have
these plans and were these rules not in
effect that's what they intend to do so
the statement that the internet isn't
going to change is definitely not
correct in that regard if you want a
little bit more check out this Free
Press article on the brief history of
net neutrality violations starting out
in 2005 leading up to 2007 2010 all the
way up to 2012 and even beyond some
stuff that happened past that but the
brief history if you're looking at the
past eight years or so in 2013 and 2014
was when this really became kind of more
of a big deal a lot of that had to do
with the increase in popularity and
Netflix also the increase in ban
with usage by Netflix and the decision
by a lot of Internet service providers
to then throttle them that led to a lot
of debates in 2013 and 2014 it led to
some attempted legal actions by the FCC
that were opposed by Internet service
providers which then led to the FCC
deciding alright we're gonna make you
title 2 and that will allow us to
enforce a net neutrality net neutrality
has been a thing and has been enforced
under title 2 since 2015 we're living in
a world with net neutrality enforced by
the FCC they're trying to change that
and take that away so the risk of
running just a bit long it's also
important to understand that the before
like from so 96 1996 allowed these
mergers to take place and in almost
every case when the FCC allowed a merger
or reviewed a murderer you can look at
the memos going back you know 2005 2000
when these different companies were
merging like when GTE merged I think
with GTE and Bell Atlantic merged that
that became Verizon who's at issue here
and in the memo for those types of
mergers a lot of time the SEC would say
look we we don't want you to do any kind
of this stuff that you're trying to pull
with the FaceTime and the Google Wallet
and like 18 the--with FaceTime and
Verizon with Google Wallet which we'll
talk more about later we don't want you
to do anti net neutrality stuff in these
memos for the mergers and in general
these companies agreed with those memos
and it's like alright we'll let you
merge but remember you got to be good
citizens and then they started being bad
citizens and if wheeler had had enough
of it so there is an obvious sort of
leading up to the action that was taken
in 2015 and it seems to us that a lot of
the arguments being made by the Internet
service providers right now of saying
like look we don't need rules to enforce
this just make it on the honor system
we'll hat will disclose to people what
we're doing and that and just leave it
at that there's plenty of evidence and
again more of this on the video over on
level-1 texts plenty of evidence to show
how internet service providers have not
been doing that in the least bit and
there's no indication of why they would
sudden somehow change in 2017 now as
compared to what they were doing leading
up to 2015
alright let's move on to item number two
though on this list the myth is
startups will not be able to compete
with title to regulations the myth
according to the FCC and their fact is
that entrepreneurs starting new
businesses online thrived long before
title 2 regulations and will continue to
flourish with more opportunities to
innovate companies like Google Facebook
Netflix and Twitter all started and
experienced tremendous - tremendous
growth under previous like light touch
rules and that is true to an extent but
I think you have to take into
consideration the context of the
Internet's being somewhat in its infancy
stages or at least its toddler stages in
the late 90s and early 2000s also the
fact that as Wendell has already stated
this it's it hasn't exactly been the
same regulatory framework going back
prior to 2015 how this fails to explain
how title 2 is in any way cumbersome for
startups and entrepreneurs that's ten
cell Section C C and that's how
deceptive language can be deceptive I
sort of just read it and took it as fact
that like oh well yeah but that's
definitely worth it pointing out that
there's no counters that's really being
presented here explain to me again how
sheep's bladders may be employed to
prevent earthquakes who are you who are
so wise in the ways of science alright
one more thing to add to that is that if
you look at these thriving
entrepreneurial internet-based
businesses such as Netflix for example
as they have grown and gotten larger
some of their opinions when it comes to
regulations have sort of changed for
example the Netflix CEO Netflix was a
champion of net neutrality and we're
using them as an example for many of the
points for making today but as they've
gotten gotten bigger and as they have
become an incumbent provider as compared
to I don't know what blockbuster who
counts before that but they've changed
their stance on net neutrality many
times and now that they are in a
position where they're gonna benefit
from net neutrality not being a thing
anymore because they are so entrenched
in the existing marketplace they're not
necessarily opposed to net neutrality
rolling back of course they keep going
back and forth on this because there's a
lot of public opinion
as well and that can sway how they
behave but just goes to show that I
don't think the arguments of all of the
existing large internet companies doing
well is one that says oh yeah it was
just fine how it was so let's go back to
how it was I mean if anything if you
really want to take this apart you could
say that Google Facebook and Netflix
have the ability to pay off companies
under paddle one as they have said that
they want because you know the specific
again we'll talk more about it later but
the FaceTime thing where AT&amp;amp;T was
blocking FaceTime unless you paid more
but that seems like not something an
entrepreneur could deal with but whereas
Apple could yes so obviously the ability
of someone to start a brand-new company
out of nothing is one of the great
wonders of the Internet's and if there
is the capability of an internet service
provider to block and throttle traffic
then there's definitely the chance of
large incumbent providers of whatever it
might be whether it's a retailer or a
media service or something like that
blocking out smaller companies and not
giving them a foothold to even get
started moving on to number three say
they their claim that the myth is that
Internet service providers will block
you from visiting websites you want to
visits they say that the Internet
service providers didn't block websites
before these regulations and they won't
after you well they didn't block
websites before they blocked a protocol
who was bid for it there yeah well big
BitTorrent and and also web sites they
don't like which text messages it was
text messages to from a political group
and Verizon was like no we're not having
this oh yeah so I mean this is the other
thing like the this this also crosses
over and bleeds into not just like well
I want my data and my internet access
because I like to go there and watch
movies and whatever like we're talking
about the potential for influencing the
actual like news and information that
people get if you have someone who feels
strongly politically one way or another
who is behind one of these large
companies you might potentially they
might be able to influence what you see
and block to you from seeing stuff that
they disagree with and that's a
big deal but also just the fact that
they've done it before very obviously
which directly counters what he just
said here is a chart from 2013 and 2014
showing Netflix speeds this is just the
most well known example but go back to
that list of net neutrality violations
that we started off with and there's
other examples in there too the idea
that this hasn't happened before is
simply false number 4 though investment
has flourished under the current
regulatory framework they're saying is a
myth they're saying that following this
regulation in 2015 broadband investment
has fallen for two years in a row and
it's the first time that that has
happened in the internet era
so first reputation of that is an ARS
technica article the FCC chair as you
pie has been accused of ignoring
investment data specifically pushing the
narrative that there's been no
investments in broadband infrastructure
now there's a huge
ohmygosh huge issue when it comes to
investment in broadband infrastructure
and we're gonna be diving into that on
Wendell's video and oh my gosh it's
crazy like all of this stuff all of this
discussion all of the arguments we're
having right now I feel like has this
this big old elephant in the room
underneath it all which is that we were
all supposed to have really good fiber
by now yeah but but we'll get to that
ignoring that completely which we
shouldn't been ignoring that looking at
broadband investment over the past 7
years at least from 2010 to 2016 shows
that it's it fluctuates it actually goes
up and down sometimes there's more
investment sometimes there's less
investment the vagaries have not been
taken into account by a GTA and in fact
there are cycles of investment within
this framework 2011 to 2012 there was an
18.9 percent growth 2012 to 2013 10.1%
growth and then while still under
light-touch regulatory framework 2013 to
2015 investment declined so stating
broadly that investment has declined
since 2015 is again simply false I'll
also point out that Google like him or
hate him
gosh darn it they've been trying to
invest in broadband deployment
but they've just been they've been
having a real hard time getting that
fiber on those balls yeah it seems seems
like they should be having an easier
time with that everywhere I've heard
about Google going and deploying Google
Fiber has been very positive but they're
they're having some challenges when it
kind of always trying those approvals
push through the courts I guess yeah
yeah I mean it's like you're having to
fight lawsuits tooth and nail and it's
like no this isn't legit and no stop
doing this and though this is our
monopoly and it's like well you know
this wouldn't be a problem if you had
reasonable Internet in this area to
begin with yeah so and again everyone
should have that more on windows and
windows video let's move on to point
number five though you won't be charged
premium to access any part of the public
Internet if this passes this is this is
my paraphrasing of what they're saying
broadband providers will not charge you
a premium if you want to reach a certain
online content the fact is that they are
free to charge you a premium for
specific websites and web services if
they want if the current plan goes
through and net neutrality strict rules
are revoked but they don't necessarily
even have to do that if they don't want
to there's other ways of getting more
money out of your internet connection
without even charging you more directly
for example back when Netflix did the
slowdown and Comcast forced them to pay
money so it doesn't necessarily need to
come from you as the end user they can
attempt to charge the actual originators
of the data that you are getting in this
example Netflix actually paid Comcast
and that's what resulted in suddenly
their Netflix speeds to their customers
going up or you know just reclassify
stuff it seems like a protection racket
doesn't it's like oh I don't feel a lot
of packets you got there'd be a shame if
something happened to them that would
that would suck I mean you never know
where there's those packets might
disappear - maybe Ajit Meyers gonna try
to convince this that we can apply RICO
laws in that case when something happens
to all your packets that it's some kind
of like criminal criminal cartel that's
abducting your packets or something
where do all the lost packets end up
there probably stockpiling them and
that's nice it's my theory what
has lost packets yes this these the
other option that they can do if they
don't want to just charge where the data
is coming from is they can zero rate
data and zero rating is where they have
a specific set of media content they
might deliver to you that isn't charged
against your internet service plan so
the data rates don't apply in those
cases now on the face of it zero rating
actually seems like a pretty appealing
thing to a consumer because it's like oh
I can watch all these movies for free
but it is leading down the path towards
darkness because zero rating actually
effectively causes the rest of the
contents to cost more money maybe not
necessarily in some configurations of a
t-mobile has had a system that was
actually okay by the FCC back during
2015 and 2016 but zero rating that was
saying those wireless providers were
specifically exempted from the title two
stuff which I thought was pretty
interesting there we go and then
wireless providers were including weird
thing there and they were included in
2015 they woman they there were there
were some rules that they had to follow
but largely they were excluded because
of the limited aggregate total global
bandwidth of that medium the last mile
bandwidth or whatever so it's kind of
complicated
but in general I would say that it's not
it's like it's bad when your ISP and the
content provider can get together for
competition because imagine you know
Netflix does zero rating for example
with t-mobile imagine a competing
service like Netflix that pops up they
wouldn't necessarily be in a position to
negotiate those zero rating fees with
with the provider they may not they may
need it able to get the time of day and
so does that mean that they're gonna
have to go with like a third-party CD
end deliver that content or does that
mean I mean that just seems like that's
setting up infrastructure to locking in
incumbents which two incumbents working
together historically is you know
generally a thing that actually happens
so we had that if you go far enough down
that path you end up with say you know
if you have four major internet service
providers in the in the country and
they're all tied to media companies then
you would basically sign up for the
internet service provider and their
media and then if you want access to any
of the other stuff maybe you have to pay
more for the cross access to the other
network obviously that's sort of a worst
case scenario but that is sort of the
negative side of zero reading I suppose
but let's move on to item number six
current regulations hurt competition
between ISPs and to deter small Internet
service provider startups and this
actually of all of the items on this
list I found to have the most sort of
partial sheen of truth to it because as
we've already discussed in today's video
there are limitations to title two
classifications there are additional
regulations and it does make it more
difficult for say a start-up ISP to get
started I think this one we're gonna
cover a lot more in the other video
because if you want to open that
Pandora's box let's talk about why those
ISPs are classified as information
services rather than common carriers in
the first place and that was because in
the ninety-six telecommunications act
these ISPs agreed to open up their local
infrastructure for all and so they in
order to bring you what they called
video dog home services they wanted to
say hey we want to separate the local
network company from the data services
that run on it so when you get a fiber
optic connection to your building your
house your outhouse your garage your you
know whatever that it's just a local
data connection you're not actually
connected to the Internet and then when
you sign up with worldcom or you know
Bell Atlantic or whoever died actually
get you on the internet or this
information service or this video
service with these TV channels and this
other video service with these other TV
channels and it is kind of I mean they
were kind of describing Netflix and Hulu
and all that kind of stuff and so I
think that that if the local loop were
unbundled and you could sign up with
multiple data providers and it all ran
over the same network then there
probably would be some truth to this but
I think if you're gonna say this you
can't ignore the other thing and the
fact is that if you look at the United
States there's something like 50 million
homes that do not have a broadband entry
and do not have more than one option for
a broadband internet connection and
that's a that's a pretty big deal
cuz again the natural competition that
would lead to the enforcement of net
neutrality just simply doesn't exist for
about half of Americans now the the way
that this is being dealt with which is a
really really kinda stupid way Michele
people know you do have choice you do
have competition is actually lowering
broadband standards or lowering the
standard for what is classified as
broadband we moved up to 25 megabits per
second from I think 4 megabits per
second and I forget when that was that
was something like 5 or 6 years ago I
believe they want to lower it lower it
back from 25 back to 10 which is just
the step in the in the wrong direction
we want faster Internet's we want more
bandwidth not the other way around the
other thing that they're potentially
doing is telling you that if you have a
wireless connection for a cell phone
that that counts like as long as you've
got enough data bandwidth on your
wireless connection then that's your
broadband internet connection but these
obviously aren't viable solutions
especially if they ever mind that Bobcat
yeah especially for anyone trying to run
a business but yet rolling back
standards so suddenly telling you you
have more more competition than you
actually do for an actual wired
broadband connection very very very
disingenuous very misleading and I'm
just gonna I'm just gonna slip in there
that in 1996 broadband the broadband
promise for 2005 was 45 megabit
symmetrical upload end down there's a
lot of people out there that would kill
for 45 upload but when we're supposed to
have that window 2,000 5,000 512 years
ago let and there's a deployment
supposed to be like nationwide right
like a very high Universal yeah so it's
like you've got a utility outhouse where
you're well pump is where it's pumping
your well water and running it to your
house yeah that's gonna have a fiber
optic connection every structure in
America 45 megabit my god all right so
we need I'm gonna try to really plow
through the rest of these so we can get
to more on that on Wendell's side
because we have yet to to record that
bit yet
but let's let's talk about some of these
other ones number seven is that fast
lanes well the myth is that this will
result in fast lanes and slow lanes
that's what a lot of people talk about
and your data will go into a slow lane
unless you pay more money that is the
general fear but this actual response
that they did here doesn't say that
that's not actually going to happen they
didn't even really respond to that
this results in fast lanes and slow
lanes on the internet and worse and
customers experience they didn't they
say it will lead to better faster and
cheaper broadband for consumers and
startups but that doesn't say there will
be no fast lanes in slow lanes what's
what's what's really exciting here is
the the we part and we already covered
this is that the terms like fast and
slow those are relative terms yeah it's
like up 25 is too fast let's redefine
fast you know just reclassified but
change the meaning of the word so we
don't have an article to link you guys
to respond to this because it doesn't
even seem like they're attempting to to
tell you that that's not going to be a
thing but yeah maybe have some
expectations that there will be fast
lanes and slow lanes if this actually
happens there is a Portugal internet
meme bouncing around the internet I'll
be honest I actually brought this up in
one of our live shows the meme itself
isn't necessarily it you can't directly
apply it to the current net neutrality
argument but there's an article on the
verge that deals with this a little bit
more basically Portugal is part of the
EU and EU actually does have some pretty
good net neutrality rules but what this
does refer to is the ability in this
package to pay a little bit more money
to get some effectively 0 rated
additional data so if you use a lot of
social or you use a lot of email or use
a lot of music you can pay an extra 5
euro a month to give yourself an
additional cap that goes only towards
that specific thing that you paid for
this is a segment essentially sort of a
strange means of 0 rating it's sort of
in that same family but since it was
brought up on the list we thought we
would at least dress address it briefly
and there is an article that you guys
can check out on that one
next up the myth is 10
regulations are good for innovation and
the facts presented is that these
regulations are in fact not good for
innovation and they list a single
instance of one major Internet service
provider that put on holds its plans to
build out of home Wi-Fi network because
of uncertainty surrounding the rules
I feel like given that there are other
links in this article that have some
backups or whatever they might come up
with more than one example or at least
give us something to go on
based on that anyway I feel like that
one's a little nebulous so we'll move on
the next one is reversing Title 2
regulations will comprise consumers
online privacy and privacy of course is
a big deal for a lot of people who want
to maintain online privacy but this one
there's actually a CNN article about
this was back in April and this was one
of the actions of the current FCC right
that's so if they're trying to tell us
that our our privacy will be better then
why are their current actions already
enabling our browser history to be sold
by our Internet service providers to
advertisers so I think that the quickest
fix for this is for somebody to get a
hold of some important person's browsing
history and you know what kinds of
terrible sites they go to and it'll be
taken care of the example I always like
to cite is the VHS remember remember
remember tapes like video tapes ok some
some reporter got ahold of some Congress
critters VHS rental records and you can
imagine like how much pornography that
the Congress crater rented and so
immediately in federal law we have the
you know protecting of the video Records
Act it became it became a high priority
very quickly in that instance so yeah
some sort of misuse of that with regards
to someone in Congress I think probably
might be the best option for helping
them preserve our online privacy but
also how sad is it that your VHS rental
records have more protections under the
law then you put your browsing history
you know I mean you can't you can't you
can't point out these
we at level one we've considered making
a MedicAlert bracelet and selling it on
our store that says delete my browsing
history that'd be a good one that aura
just have it tattooed across your chest
along with do-not-resuscitate all right
the next one I was a little confused
about repealing title t regulations will
make it harder for disadvantaged
Americans to get online this isn't
something that I've heard argued very
much so I don't have a direct response
to it but apparently this might be an
issue
honestly we're talking about the cost of
the Internet's and we're also talking
about how much investment internet
service providers have made in the
internet for Americans again according
to the agreements that they have made
with the federal government that seems
like the best option to get people cheap
Internet rather than providing Internet
service providers with a means of
charging people more money
that just seems seems like a kind of it
they're lobby for ways to subsidize this
because I think Verizon has the thing
where you can opt into their super
privacy inviting thing and they'll give
you a few bucks off your your monthly
plan oh yeah it just tracks everything
you do yes your Mike's maybe won't win
they didn't come right out and say that
so I feel like that they probably
responded that way for this one but that
sort of been in conflict with the one
talking about privacy huh yeah it kind
of is yeah you've you can choose you
have your options you can either have
privacy or you can have money but you
cannot have both
all right there's three more items on
the list first one here is fed of tea
see they're gonna handle it don't worry
about it
we'll just give all the internet
regulation responsibilities to the to
the FTC rather than the FCC where you go
into this on Windows video because
there's some legalities involved and it
bares a little bit more explanation and
we've already gone way longer and my
short video than we intended to the
final one on the list is that you can't
abandon quote approved title two rules
without a change in circumstances and
specifically refers to the Supreme Court
now this is just a little frustrating
again going all the way back to what the
FCC is doing right now with their intent
to create laws that will prevent for
instance states from creating
neutrality rules obviously the Supreme
Court has weighed in already on the
decisions that have been made with
regards to net neutrality but this is
just one of those legal arguments I
believe like oh the court approved the
courts already approved it so you can't
change it that is not the case right now
but the final one here and this one we
all will talk a little bit about is the
the commentary process the FCC actually
introduced the notice of proposed
rulemaking back in May they had a
commentary you can go online and go to
the FCC website and post the comments on
it there were 22 more than 22 million
comments filed their response by the FTC
FCC to the comments is very strange
because on the one hand it seems like
they're saying hey we opened up these
comments so the public can comment and
let us know what they feel on the other
hand the commenting process is not an
opinion poll and for good reason and the
Chairman's plan is based on facts and
law rather than quantity of comments so
go ahead and comment so we can know how
you feel and then completely ignore what
your comments actually say because we're
worried about the law rather than the
quantity of comments there were some
statements made about this regarding
like oh we're gonna take only gonna take
your comment seriously if you have like
some legal framework going on in there
something like that but regardless of
all that the comments themselves have
been grossly compromised according to
just about anyone that you talk to about
it in fact there's a Pew Internet
article here that has a bunch of
screenshots of it's going through and
you can just see from there they pulled
data directly using the FCC's internet
portal and for instance thousands of
submissions feature duplicate names 16
17 thousands comments the name was just
net neutrality 7,400 was just the
internet there's also a breakup of the
different different all the different
comments and whatnot but essentially
there's a ton of repeat comments there
are a ton of times when a bunch of
comments were submitted all at the same
time there was an API that was set up
that they believe was being taken
advantage of in order to submit bulk
duplic
comments there was accusations that
there was a DDoS attack on the FCC right
after there was a bunch of promotion
about this going on and that suddenly
the people couldn't submit comments and
there's a lot of mystery surrounding
what went on with that my favorite part
was the alphabetical names like the
names are showing up in alphabetical
order as if so we got all these hundred
thousand people together and it's like
Aaron a something yes your turn alright
so there's obviously obviously 22
million comments we're not all submitted
by your average American who wanted to
go in there and let the FCC know what
their thoughts were on net neutrality
now Brandon Carr is common here in his
publication specifically singles out Pro
title to net neutrality comments that
were submitted multiple times like very
specifically seven point eight there 7.5
million submitted with the same sentence
in association with only 50 thousand
unique names and addresses if you read
this your impression is that all of the
falsely submitted comments were for net
neutrality not true not true in the
slightest in fact the best sort of
breakdown that I've seen of it looks at
all of those comments removes anything
that's duplicate and yes we know that
probably removes Pro and anti net
neutrality comments and just looks at
the remainder if you if you take that
all out there's only about 2% I believe
that our actual unique comments and of
that 2% 98.5 percent of the original
comments are in favor of net neutrality
or alternatively phrased oppose killing
net neutrality and there's a tech there
article on on that there so it seems
like if you look directly at the
comments that are unique and in my
opinion if you're getting that many
false comments these are the ones that
you should probably trust that it does
seem like most people in fact the vast
majority people are in favor of net
neutrality and are in favor of it being
enforced the way it currently is
enforced alternatively maybe
some of the people who are calling for
the FCC to take a closer look at this
before they go ahead and vote on
December 15th maybe we should do that
maybe we should wait that's the other
option because there's obviously some
shenanigans going on with all that and I
I certainly would like to know more
about it before they go ahead and vote
this thing through
I'm all for a democratic process it does
make sense to me that you wouldn't want
the unwashed masses dictating everything
but I think that there's a there's a
different take a different approach that
a jeep I could take on this which is to
just look at the transgressions that led
from the original title 1 to title 2
reclassification and what led from the
1934 Telecommunications Act to the 1996
Telecommunications Act and say you know
what AT&amp;amp;T and Comcast and some of these
other companies they were doing
something that isn't right and it is
actually anti-competitive and we are
going to do this and this when we roll
them back to title 1 to make sure this
doesn't happen I think that they would
probably be better off to just do more
forbearance when win wheeler enacted
title to there was about 700 things that
he said that these don't apply and
that's that's a mechanism called
forbearance and so I think a Jeep I
could do that her title to he's like hey
you know what we found that these other
things in title 2 they're too
restrictive for these companies and
they've got some really good idea for
business and commerce we're gonna add
these to the list of things under title
2 that companies don't need to follow
and I think that just just even some
inkling that he's considering that would
probably go a long way from the PR
aspect but I just I haven't seen any of
that in any of the press release or any
of the material or any kind of hint that
anybody is actually trying to do a
reasonable and intelligent analysis of
the situation it seems like weighing
both sides of the arguments in the
arguments we're seeing for what they're
doing what they're planning to do would
yeah it would relieve a lot of people's
concerns over what's going on it would
at least make you feel like hey this is
an agency that's supposed to be there to
help Americans it's supposed to be there
to provide people with equal access to
regulate communications in such a way
that's the company
that control those the the the
infrastructure and the connection can't
take advantage of people and it doesn't
seem like the actions that they're going
forward with are doing that or are even
taking into account that hey here is
what would be best for people it seems
like all of the arguments are basically
taking what the internet service
providers have been saying will be best
for them and sort of pacing it over and
saying look here's how why we're doing
this and we're gonna do it regardless of
what you tell us but anyway this video
has been much longer than was
anticipated I'll be honest I anticipate
it was gonna go long anyway we're gonna
do another one
I'm windle's Channel so we're gonna do
that right now I want to post a link to
that in this video's description guys
thank you so much for watching this
video and sticking with us with us the
entire way I know this is a sort of a
weighty dense issue and really
appreciate you taking the time to give
it your full thought and consideration
and of course if you guys want to post
some comments in the comment section
down below you are welcome to do that
hit the thumbs up button too if you
enjoyed this video I'll be back with
more con sense that's a little bit more
tech related and not so much net
neutrality related very soon Wendell
thank you again so much for being here
today and for participate in install
video collaboration thank you for having
me it's been amazing
of course links to Windows channel down
there to go subscribe level one techs
they do great work thanks for watching
again guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
