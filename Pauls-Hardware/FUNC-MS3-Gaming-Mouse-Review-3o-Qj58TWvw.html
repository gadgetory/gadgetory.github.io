Harbor this is my review of the MS 3
Gaming Mouse
myfunc so here's a closer look at the
func ms3 Mouse of course and the other
items that are included in the retail
box you get an MS 3 setting software
disc right there which means you don't
have to download them you can just run
that and I tried that out in the
software right off that this works just
fine you can also download straight from
funk net which is their website you also
get a product manual right here which is
very well written and clearly laid out
and I don't think you guys can even read
that text right now so I'll just set
that aside
ok speaking of the mouse here's the
mouse itself and I wanted to start off
with a quick comparison because a lot of
folks have mentioned so far it's quite
sizable and I find that not to be a
problem but I did want to give a
side-by-side comparison so this is my
old and dirty Logitech ms5 mx518 it's
been my standby for quite some time
and there's you can see quite a bit of a
wider stance on the MS 3 right there
I've also got a razor this is an augur
no this is not a Mac this is a Death
Adder
razer deathadder right they're very very
popular old-school mouse from razer it's
been around quite some time again this
one has been seen some use so it's not
quite as in good of shape as it used to
be but there's kind of a side by side by
side of the MS 3 the logitech mx518 and
the Razer Naga and now there is our
death addict which I keep calling their
Naga because I don't know why now we're
closer look at the mouse itself so first
off this is sort of a full hand grip
style Mouse so you can see it's got
ridges right here for your ring finger
and your pinky finger so when your hand
sits on it you don't have any fingers
dragging off to the side it's a it's a
feel that I personally like I know it's
kind of subjective because some folks
like to grip the side of the mouse with
their fingers especially if you do much
lift off and I've found that I can to
lift off with this despite that because
there are these grooves do protrude to
the point where I feel like I can get a
grip on it I don't really do a whole lot
liftoff when I'm gaming anyway I use a
pretty well it's kind of middle DPS
setting I think it's somewhere between
1,500 and 2,000 that I I've settled on
for this particular Mouse and yeah that
doesn't require me to do liftoff very
much but of course it's it's a 10 button
Mouse so you got left and right click
the course up there scroll wheel as well
Center click button this button up here
to the right upper right of the right
click will switch between your different
profiles profiles are indicated by an
LED right here so there's 1 2 and 3 for
these 3 different profiles and then when
you're in each profile you can use these
two buttons to switch your dpi and that
will change the color from whites to
orange on these and then you can tell
which of the 3 preset dpi settings
you're set to on this side you have a
forward and back buttons of course you
also have that sniper button right there
so pushing that by default will drop
your dpi to about 90 or so and it gives
you a really slow tracking of the mouse
so you can hone in for headshots and
that sort of thing got the funk logo
there on the side I also have a lower
button right there which I personally
haven't used as much it's one of those
roll down buttons you kind of roll your
thumb down over it to hit it it's
default set to mute which I suppose
could be useful in some circumstances
but of course using the included
software you can reprogram all of these
buttons if you want to and then you can
save the settings to the internal memory
on the mouse which I believe is 512
kilobytes and then wherever you take the
mouse those settings will go with you
and you don't necessarily need to redo
the software anything
here's a look at the bottom which shows
plenty of finger prints on it big wide
Teflon Teflon pads on there for easy
gliding across well so have your sensor
right here which is a neva go a DNS 95
hundred dpi range of 92 5670 so variable
dpi range of course then the polling
rates
adjustable up to a thousand Hertz and I
definitely prefer the thousand Hertz
polling rates do any of the other ones
that I tried out on there finally your
cord has sort of a cool orange and black
theme 2 meters and lengths and then one
of the things that it has which I guess
I can't really complain about but gold
plated gold plated USB plug what
I find personally to be frankly quite
useless gold-plating a digital
connection doesn't really do much but
it's a blink vector I suppose and some
people do think that it improves
performance gold-plating only helps
analog connections let me just say that
straight up one other thing I want to
point out is it's got a bit of lift up
lift off here in the back towards the
end and I believe at least in my
experience I use a mouse a wrist wrist
when I use a mouse and this is actually
works perfect for me because it kind of
gives you that straight arm like you
want you don't want to have any kink in
your arm right there when you're using
your mouse and so I find that that works
great I'm not sure how it would work if
you don't use a wrist wrist because I've
been using one for quite a few years now
and I can't really go without any more
but that is something that you might
want to consider as well and here's a
look at the mouse plugged in and as you
can see we have three areas that light
up on the mouse right here you have your
LEDs indicating the profile that you're
on or your dpi setting depending on what
button you push again here and push that
switch between the profiles I've been
sticking with profile 3 there it is
it turns white when you switch profiles
and then back to orange to indicate your
dpi settings and then you can push these
buttons to go up and down the different
dpi settings if I have a complaint here
about the lighting at least usually on
that I don't really care that much about
lighting in a mouse but these only are
orange or whites it'd be really cool if
you could change these colors or if you
could change the defaults from orange to
white I think the lower one here might
be the only one that actually has a
white actually no they've all got white
anyway it'd be cool if maybe they did an
update in the future that allowed you to
change these to default to white instead
of orange because it would give you some
other options for color combinations
with these up here but as you can see
that's the pulse effect that you can do
on both of those right now
kind of cool and then let me switch back
here you can also individually do the
color for the scroll wheel and the side
button so I've given gone kind of with a
orange yellow and green
for right now and lastly here is a quick
walkthrough of the home chemistry
setting software so as you can see three
profiles listed up on top you can easily
jump between the three of them to change
their settings I have been working with
profile 3 so I'll stick with that one
under basic settings you have three
different dpi steps you can adjust
individually and yes I guess I actually
settled on 1440 dpi you also have your
insta name dpi that you can adjust as
well you also have the option to
separate the x and y settings if you
want a different dpi setting for each of
those after pointer sensitivity right
there of course pretty basic for mice
you have lift-off diffe distance that
you can change and pretty much you got
low medium or high for that option now
you can also turn on or off angle
snapping and pointer acceleration as
well as a restored defaults button of
course adjust your double-click speed
adjust the scrolls field speed for the
scroll wheel scroll by page to turn on
and off and then again that polling rate
which I I'm sticking with a thousand
Hertz and I'm never changing it to
anything else that's all I'm gonna be
using for this one for about an
assignment here you get a nice visual
layout of the entire mouse where you can
see all of the buttons all clearly
labeled and simply use a drop down here
to switch to a different key command for
the different button that you've chosen
finally for color settings here's where
you can individually choose the colors
for the scroll wheel as well as the LED
as well as the side button LED you can
have this really wide range of color
options to choose from you can even
change the saturation and brightness so
if you do want white just drop the
saturation down to nothing and you can
have white glowing LEDs which looks kind
of cool you can also even adjust the
brightness so pretty flexible here as
far as the LED color settings again I
just wish you can change the LEDs for
the profile indicator ones that would be
my one big request for this mouse even
just a change in white would give you a
lot of other color options to go with
with the wheel and the side button so
func if you're listening maybe maybe a
software update can allow that in the
future they also have a macro editor
here you can record and save macros
supports will pop up the
I'm website maca finish so you can
easily back up to a file or restore from
a file that you have previously saved on
your computer that's gonna wrap it up
for this review guys and in case you
were wondering since I already did do an
overview of this mouse on new ITV why am
i doing more coverage over here well I
wanted to give my personal feedback my
personal opinions on this mouse also a
bit of an idea I had I guess going
forward if I find a product at Newegg
and I do a unboxing or an overview of it
there and I decided that I liked that
product well I'll hit up the
manufacturer and say hey I'd like to
review this product on my own channel so
that's what I did in this case I'm happy
to say that I've been very happy with
this mouse so far the things that I
liked I liked the grip that you have on
it I like the fact that your hand rests
evenly and that your entire hand is held
up off of the table by the mouse
including the pinky and index finger
right there
the ring ring finger let's forget which
fingers which I like the fact that it
rides really smoothly and another thing
that I really like is the polling rate
actually the I was able to bump that up
to a thousand Hertz I was actually one
of my negative feelings about it right
off the bat plug in and was that I
didn't like the tracking of it quite so
well but bumping that polling rate up to
the thousand Hertz really fixed that for
me and give it a nice smooth glide every
time I was using it I was doing a bit of
play practice with Crysis 3 and whereas
I have seen mice and even used mice with
a sniper button before this is the first
time that I actually started using it in
practice and I must say I really like it
it's very nice for honing in on those
headshots and whatnot nothing I'm very
good at FPS games or anything and then I
also like the software of course because
it's really straightforward and easy to
use and I love the fact that the
profiles are saved directly to the mouse
so that they mean if you pick up the
mouse bring it to a different computer
plug it in it will automatically have
your profile saved and you can use the
functions on the mouse to switch between
them because personally I hate having
software that's installed on the
computer that runs in the system tray I
try to remove anything there that's not
absolutely necessary and I'm glad to say
that once you install the software as
friendly as it is to use you can easily
turn it off or
uninstall it or whatever you want to do
or at least turn it off so it doesn't
start up on system boot so that it's not
in your tray and eating up resources
even though it's really not that much
but just a little thing I like to do I
keep my tray clean definitely a mouse I
recommend if you have a the style of
drips that you like to rest your whole
hand on the mouse including your palm
not so good for clogged rippers and a
little bit more difficult to lift the
mouse although I have gotten pretty
adept at it by gripping this little
Ridge right here with my pinky but if
you do a lot of lift off that might this
might not be your choice also I must say
that this is kind of a subjective review
this is my review and since I have kind
of medium to large hands it fits my hand
really well actually I Cal try this one
out and whereas he loves the my onyx
mouse which is very similar in design to
this mouse he really didn't like this
one so it's kind of a your mileage may
vary thing you know you might have some
people where it fits their hand really
well like mine and for folks who maybe
have smaller more delicate hands like
Kyle well it might not fit you quite as
smoothly but for me it worked out
perfect and if you think your hands are
the same shape as mine or you maybe have
the same type of grip as mine maybe
it'll work for you too but that's gonna
do it for this review I give this mouse
nine out of ten and thanks for watching
