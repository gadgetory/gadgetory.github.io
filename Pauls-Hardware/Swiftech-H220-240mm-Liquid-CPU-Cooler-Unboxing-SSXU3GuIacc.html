paul's hardware today i'm going to be
doing an unboxing and overview of this
closed loop liquid cpu cooler from
swiftech this is the h 2 20 so here's a
closer look at the h 2 20 s retail box
and before i go over all the details
here i want to talk about what makes
this cpu cooler special because it's
it's fairly special it's it's fairly
unique as the closed-loop cpu coolers go
and that's for a few different reasons
one is the construction it's one of the
only actually probably the only clothes
of cooler at this time that has an
actual copper fin radiator you get
higher end components in here swiftech
has been in the business of making
custom cpu cooling and liquid cooling
components for quite some time they've
actually had an h2o series for a while
as well but this is probably their
biggest for foray into the market and if
you look at a lot of other other coolers
that are out there on h100 for example
quite a few of the other closed-loop
coolers whether you're talking about the
ones from zalmen or from an SEC a lot of
them are actually made by a couple OMS
in China either kulit or ace tech
swiftech on the other hand is actually a
manufacturer a lot of the components
themselves so this is going to be a much
different cooler than you will see than
any of those other ones that are
rebranded or slightly modified from the
base kulit or ace tech design so that's
pretty cool the other thing is that this
is not just meant to be a single
closed-loop cooler it's actually meant
to be upgradable so you have the option
because they've used some more
standardized tubing as well as giving
you the option for example of having a
fill port on its to actually get into
this and they've also put in a much much
stronger pump than you would actually
need for just a simple single
closed-loop cooler like this and for
that reason the pump does run slightly
louder but you can turn it down and
modify it because it's PWM controllable
but it does give you the option for
instance at CES they were demonstrating
this cooling a cpu and two video cards i
don't remember which ones they were off
the top of my head i believe they were
gtx 670 s or some long
designs but very very strong pump
included as well okay enough am I
talking let's go ahead and take a closer
look at some of the details on the box
designed for low to inaudible operating
noise with true enthusiast level thermal
performance novices and hardcore martyrs
alike will love its plug-and-play
installation as well as easy
expandability to full-blown custom loop
that's in quotes and guess I guess
that's a quote from the swiftech design
team that's all I can presume by the way
that's formatted but anyway still nice
to say anyway this is part of the h2o
series this is the H 220 compact to
drive to cpu cooler quiet pirate
plug-and-play liquid cooling system
there's a closer look at it and you do
get a three year manufacturer warranty
from swiftech for this device when it
comes to compatibility we have pretty
much every socket you could you could
want this day and age from Intel I'll go
back to LGA 775 1155 1156 1366 and 2011
a good question about this and I haven't
confirmed but socket 1150 is coming out
from Intel soon from my understanding
and please bear in mind this is
preliminary 1150 should have the same
mounting solution as 1155 and 1156
that's what I've heard it's too early to
say for sure right now but once that is
out this should drop right in but please
double check once once everything is
actually released still compatible as
well with 1366 and 2011 so for the
enthusiast platforms you're also set and
2011 is particularly easy to install
with the universal backplate also for
AMD you have a.m. 2 and 3 and all of the
derivative sockets thereof so a.m. 2
plus an a3 plus of course as well fm1
fm2 and all the way back to socket 939
here are the box contents liquid cooling
system it comes preassembled and pre
filled with coolant ready to use this is
a dual 120 millimeter radiator so if you
have a standard 240 millimeter mount
which have become fairly standard these
days that's 2 x 120 it should fit pwm
control on those of the fans water block
with the integrated pump also PWM
controllable on the pump itself which is
pretty nice pwm signal splitter 58 x 38
inch PVC tubing so this is actual
ubel replaceable tubing three-eighths
inch inner diameter you also get
pre-installed mounting screws for intel
LGA 1155 156 and 1366 you get spare
mounting assembly for sukkot 2011 or m2
or m3 or any of the FM one FM two
sockets any of the empty sockets you get
thermal grease included as well as a
quick start installation guide it's more
info on a panel on the opposite side so
these are actually helix pwm fans rated
at sixteen to thirty three decibels each
the helix fans are very popular from
swiftech they do a really good job that
this particular unit is optimized for
noise generation apart rather than
maximum performance cooling of course
you can get that if you do want extreme
cooling you might consider swapping
these fans out with some that are more
generated more geared toward static
pressure and airflow but these will be
running very very quiet in your system
so even with a strong overclock you
should have a very silent system if
you're going with this cooler
substantially better thermal performance
and high-end air coolers and or
competing all-in-one liquid cooling
systems and finishing up with the retail
box over on this side we have some
technical specifications in really
really tiny printing I'm not sure if you
guys can read that I don't want to go
over every single one because I've
already spent a lot of time on the box
finally here are the more specific
dimensions again if you guys want to
take a closer look both width height and
depth for all of those since I the box
you have aa pretty much there it is
again it's preassembled for you out of
the box so here's the actual you don't
let me set that aside and check out
additional accessories in here is your
h220 manual here is oh this is actually
a little fan splitter pwm fan splitter
so you can use this to connect many fans
to the same source and powered by a
molex plug pwm on that side to give you
the just PWM control power comes from
that here's your included one gram
swiftech Tim mate thermal interface
material some pretty serious AMD
brackets if some additional connector
shouldn't stick connectors these are
screws guessing these might be these
lga2011 screw kit I also have some
washers right there and some smaller
screws you have more screws these are
all separated up see what's what and
these are the long screws which are to
actually mount additional fence if right
now it's set up right now set up to push
and exhaust air but if you do have
additional fans about set up push pull
those are the extra screws you would use
for that not for a closer look at the
h220 itself we're going to start down
here on the block / pump so as you can
see it comes pre-installed so right now
for most intel LGA sockets this is
already configured or it's at least set
up the way it should be installed so
you're back plates already there what
you would do to install is actually
unscrew these remove back plate use the
adhesive to adhere the back plate to the
back of your motherboard and mount this
on top after you did some thermal paste
and whatnot of course it's got a sim
piece of plastic over there to protect
the surface right there and keep it free
of oils from the skin and whatnot and
then we have a weighty pump that's on
top of this as you can see we actually
already have the clamp fittings here on
the tubing so this is five eighths inch
outer diameter outer diameter
three-eighths inch inner diameter so if
you were going to add on to this you
would simply remove these screws right
here these are adjustable of course they
can be turned or event of course you
don't want to kink the tubing when
you're actually setting it up but that
will allow you to set this up in
multiple configuration so you have kind
of a honeycomb pattern there on top of
the pub which gives it a pretty cool
look and that's a pretty much quick look
at that I did want to come back really
quick to this PWM control unit right
here because I think there's a really
nice little add-on that they've had I
noticed that there's a red one here the
red connector is actually the only one
that will report your rpm settings so if
you're using this for your CPU you
definitely want to plug
otherwise your motherboard might think
that your CPU fan is it spinning
spinning but then you have up to eight
PWM fans you can add on that there's a
bit of adhesive on the back so you can
stick it on or it comes with a couple
mounting screws so you can mount it to
your system and like everything in here
has a nicely braided cable and now I'm
moving on to the rad and yeah so fans
are pre-installed as you can see right
there that actually used smaller screws
that fit just underneath like so your
cables oh they're actually tied on there
so they've wrapped the cables for the
helix fans around here so as you can see
these are four pin put a PWM capable
fans they have white blades which look
pretty sweet here's your fill port
easily accessible and then flipping it
around to the back trying my best not to
kink the tubing and we can see the
radiator itself so the radiator you
might not be able to tell just by
looking at it but I can tell by holding
it that it's using copper fins in there
significantly heavier even even negating
the way to the fans it's installed and
they're significantly heavier than any
other radiator I've seen this thickness
is about the same thickness as still as
in h100i for example but those copper
fins and they're going to provide better
heat transference and better performance
overall so again you can install
additional fans right there if you want
to set up a push-pull configuration and
this is the radiator as well as the
reservoir so you can see there's an
extra bit right here one more time just
to look at this side so you guys can see
again tubing here flexible fittings on
there and again you got your clamps that
are attached so you can remove this
tubing from either side if it's you know
if you decide to add on to it or if say
three years done one you want it to give
it a full clean out but again even if
you are planning on using this and not
actually expanding it or anything
although you're recommending you do is
use some swiftech coolant and fill it up
via the fill port right there if you
ever need to in the future but again
should last for at least three years
without that even being necessary and
that's gonna wrap it up for this video
guys once again this has been my
unboxing and overview of the h220 from
swiftech I do have an additional video
planned for this particular product I'm
going to be doing a comparison between
this and the thermaltake water 2 point 0
extreme that's currently cooling the CPU
in the system behind me so stay tuned
for that don't forget to Like and
subscribe if you enjoyed it this video
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
