some wonderful things but eventually
there comes a time when every PC must be
relegated to the scrap yard worrisome
though this process may be by following
a few simple steps you can make your
computer's passing a painless one
whether it's been with you for years or
you just built it for a sweet video you
made last month first thank the great
spirit and thank the computer for its
service to you after all you had some
good times together didn't you of course
you did
so after saying your goodbyes put the
computer down with dignity by covering
its intakes until its clock speed drops
to zero moving quickly to outpace the
onset of solder mortis skin and
disassemble the system saving the
choicest parts for reuse some components
such as this optical drive may become
obsolete since the system was built and
can be added to your e-waste recycling
pile you do have an e-waste recycling
pile don't you I'll punch you in the
neck if you don't we will recycle all
that stuff very soon for safety purposes
long-term storage devices like SSDs or
this hard disk drive should be kept
indefinitely as archives or utterly
destroyed
that felt good
and of course prepare the remainder of
the components for listing on eBay that
is all for this demonstration
thank you all so much for clicking the
like button if you enjoyed it and of
course you are all welcome to subscribe
to my youtube channel for future videos
links to many important things are down
in the description good day
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
