probing Paul this is my monthly QA video
I answer questions that you guys have
technology or otherwise so thank you to
everyone who submitted questions last
month actually a little more than a
month ago because I did not do
probing Paul in May because May was a
little challenging for me I've been
raising a baby and stuff like that but
getting back into things today so feel
free to check out my old probing pulse
if you have never seen any of them that
goes pretty far back these days so
although it's already June this is
technically the probing Paul for May and
I might do another one for June so if
you do have questions to ask me leave
them down in the comment section down
below I also went to Twitter this
morning and asked for some questions
there so I have kind of a mix today some
questions from Twitter some from last
month's video let's get right into it
the first question is from Excalibur who
says what made you want to be a tech
youtuber and what did you do before
YouTube as a good question I don't
sometimes I think about that myself and
I'm like what how did I get into this
you guys might be familiar with new egg
TV that's where I started out making
youtube videos about technology and that
was for new egg and then I branched off
and went independent in 2013 or 2014 at
a bit of an overlap there so what made
me want to be a tech youtuber I think
was probably some of the initial success
that I had through new egg I had a
regular job a regular paying job at new
egg and then I transitioned over to
start making YouTube videos for new egg
and I was lucky enough to be able to
make them with some degree of
Independence and I tried to also make
videos that I felt like I would watch if
I was interested in watching videos
about computer parts and stuff
fortunately people seem to like that way
of doing things so that was what kind of
gave me the confidence to be like yeah
maybe this is something that I could do
on my own and independently and that's
what I eventually ended up doing I had
several other jobs that I did at Newegg
I was a systems analyst I was in
customer service for a while it was kind
of cool I was able to shift to different
jobs as I worked there to sort of expand
my horizons and learn new things prior
to that I didn't have much of a regular
job I I did college and then I did some
random jobs after that including working
at Dave &amp;amp; Buster's for a while so I
guess that sort of sums that up next
question is from Ted Hart Davis and this
one comes from Twitter and he asks how
are you going to introduce your child to
technology because I do have a child now
a little
her name is Hana I have a personal
update video where I showed a bit of
footage of her and stuff and she's crazy
cute and everything and that's why I
haven't been making as many videos of
past month because looking after her has
been a lot of work it takes a lot of
time and dedication everything so back
to your question the hi my am i planning
to introduce her to technology I haven't
thought about that too much at this
point I know it's gonna be inevitable
but I think one of the best ideas I've
seen it was actually Linus's idea of
introducing his kids to technology and
suppose more specifically video games
and he wanted to start early and
actually have his kids play video games
but like old video games and then slowly
sort of bring them through and get them
up to speed with current video games so
they could sort of experience that
transition with video games for those of
us who have been playing games for you
know twenty plus years they've changed a
lot over time and in some ways that's
good in some ways that's bad as for
technology in general that's actually
really good question and maybe something
that if you guys have suggestions for me
you could leave in the comments section
I don't know if there's a whole lot of
technology that's baby related
especially like newborn or infant
related but I'd be open to doing that
here and there again I don't want to
make my channel all about baby stuff or
even focus on that too much because and
a lot of people are more interested in
the technology if you guys have any
suggestions please leave them in the
comment section down below next few
questions are also from Twitter and
these are all also from fellow tech
youtubers so this was from Lauren tasty
PC TV who's been doing tech YouTube for
quite a while there she was on hey it's
for a while but I think she's making
videos again but she just asked what's
your favorite announcement from Computex
I did a single Computex video about the
AMD announcements they're the keynote
that they did where they confirmed the
3900 X as well as several other CPUs
from the rise in 3000 series platform I
have a video on that so if you guys want
to check it out but I think that for me
was the big announcement and I honestly
didn't see a whole lot of other stuff
besides that I mean there was other
stuff
Omura there's lots of videos on it lots
of people who were there who made videos
on it I was gonna do some sort of
summation videos and I didn't that's
because of the baby honestly but also
that I didn't find anything that really
leaked out and grabbed me there wasn't
any huge announcements from Nvidia Intel
was like hey we've done an animator
still coming in the future and really
all right and tell us when you have
products to ship AMD is the only one
who's like here's our products here's
the specs here's when we're gonna launch
them here's some SKUs and some some
demos and everything of course we're
still waiting for independent reviews
independent testing especially comparing
the 3000 series stuff to what Intel
currently has on offer so that'll be
exciting other than that there were a
few things here and there but nothing
that I felt like was mind-blowing so I
saw a few people saying that the
Computex was a little bit of a letdown
this year and maybe that's true to an
extent or maybe people just had really
high expectations but that's what it
came down to for me and one more
question here from Christopher ye who
also has a tech YouTube channel if you
guys aren't familiar he has some really
good videos youtube.com slash
Christopher he said how do you deal with
burnout as a content creator this is
actually a hard question because burnout
I feel like can come from multiple
sources or at least for me it has come
from multiple sources and it can be
derived from feeling like you don't have
any good ideas to feeling like you have
I have ideas but maybe those ideas
aren't good enough to feeling like you
know YouTube itself the algorithm or
whatever isn't treating you as kindly as
it could and then there's also like life
stuff that can happen and come along and
be very distracting and you can feel
like man I need to make a video but
there's so much other stuff going on and
you know you have to split your time and
figure out how much time you have to
invest in a video versus how much time
you have to invest in real life stuff
and I've dealt with all of these in
various levels over the years and I
think for me it boils down to making
content that I feel good about that and
exercise giving exercise is very often
something that if I'm feeling like down
I'm like you know what just get some
more exercise and suddenly you feel like
you have more energy and everything so
that's one solution but for me I think
it comes down to if I'm really feeling
burnt out or like I'm just not feeling
passionate about the content that I'm
making that I need to make something
that's either difference either slightly
or completely different and also that I
need to sort of take all the pressures
away that you might feel pressured about
when making YouTube videos how many
views am I getting are people enjoying
the content and hitting the thumbs up
button
am I getting lots of engagement and
feedback I mean very often it just comes
back to views is the
resonating with people and doing well
and I try to set all that stuff aside
and just make a video that I want to
make and I don't care how many views it
gets I don't care if people like it all
I care about is if I liked the video and
if I enjoyed making the video and if I
felt fulfilled by whatever I created and
screw what anyone else thinks or what
YouTube thinks or anything I just want
to make something that I feel good about
and I think in times of the past when
I've really felt burnt out just pushing
all that other stuff aside and focusing
on making content that I want to do his
has been the solution that's gotten me
through those those harder times getting
back to some questions from last month's
probing Paul with some allemande ely
asks hey paul i got temperature spikes
on my cpu horizon seven twenty seven
hundred x use a stock cpu cooler what do
you think is causing these spikes by the
way you're amazing thank you bassam for
that final comments i think you're
amazing too first off with Rison there
is a temperature offset that's built-in
by default it's not as much with the
2000 series as it was with the 1000
series i think it's only like 10 degrees
the 2700 x so make sure that the
software you're using is up-to-date to
make sure you're getting good reporting
if you have to be absolutely sure you
should use the latest version of the
rise and master utility because that's
the stuff that's made by AMD and that
should be giving you good reporting as
far as what your temperatures are if
you're using third-party software to
monitor that like I 264 or hardware info
or something like that make sure you
have the most up-to-date versions of
that to make sure you're getting good in
act your accurate reporting I like
hardware info 64 because it will show
you both the offset temperature and
actual temperature the reason they do an
offset is so that your system thinks
that the CPU is hotter than it is to run
the fans at a higher speed to cool down
a CPU more and when the CPU is cooler
then it will overclock itself more with
the XF our extended frequency range and
that will get you better performance
that's that's why they did that
specifically that said if you actually
are getting crazy temperature spikes I
would double check the actual physical
seating of your heatsink on the CPU
itself because you might have partial
contact there or maybe the thermal paste
got messed up or something like that
just double checking to make sure that
it's seated firmly that it's screwed all
the way down so you have good pressure
and contact can help solve that problem
because what you might be dealing with
is the CPU trying to overclock itself
with XFR temperature spikes go up and
then this
feels like whoa it's too hot in here and
it dials stuff back down and the
temperature spike goes back down
hopefully one of those two solutions is
what's causing your problem next
question here from geometric gaming I've
got a question I'm getting ready to bill
it by a new graphics card for my
computer I'm worried I won't get all the
drivers from my previous card off my
computer it may screw with my
performance learning what's the best way
to remove all those old drivers and make
sure I get them all your answer here and
it's one that I've I think I've talked
about before is ddu or display driver
uninstaller it's available for download
from guru of 3d gets pretty regular
updates I think this actually the most
recent version is only like a week or so
old and in order to run ddu properly in
order to remove all the current graphics
drivers that you currently have whether
you're talking AMD or nvidia is to
reboot your system into safe mode and if
you want to boot your computer in safe
mode I would recommend checking this
video out I feel like this is an
underappreciated video that I've made is
there's lots of good advice in this
video but if you hold down the shift key
while you go to restart with Windows 10
it'll allow you to access the advanced
startup menu and from there you can go
to the troubleshoots thing here and then
from there you can go to Advanced
Options and then from there you can
actually tell it to boot into your UEFI
so if you're not able to get into your
UEFI or BIOS by pressing delete on
system startup this is another way to
get into that or if you go to more
Recovery Options you go to startup
settings then it will restart and then
when it restarts you want to hit 4 to
enable safe mode it will boot into safe
mode then you can run display driver and
installer and then it will clean all the
drivers off and then restart and then
it'd be good to install your new drivers
for your new graphics card next question
is from Roy Evans he said I know this is
probing Paul I actually have a question
for Joe the editor who's right there
fortunately I said I recently found your
channel I was hoping you could do a live
stream of your process with editing one
of Paul's videos from start to finish I
could find it entertaining and also
learn about potential problems that may
arise so he's asking Joe to do a live
stream Joe do you ever do you have a lot
you have a twitch channel or something
all of that work it was a time-sensitive
video that's true
but if there's personal information that
he's gonna livestream to you guys or
something like that usually he has to
redact a bunch of stuff you know I'm
like running around naked back here and
stuff
but fortunately I think we have maybe a
few solutions you can tweet to him on
Twitter Joe underscore editing and and
if he's gonna do that livestream thing
maybe he'll let you know there but I
think this is actually an interesting
idea for a video is just like kind of
talk about the process that we have here
for making video since we film stuff
here and Joe edits and he usually edits
remotely and sometimes he's here with me
to film stuff and then he takes the
footage with him other times i film
stuff and then i transcode it and then
send it to him with the resilient so
there's a couple options there but a
good idea for a future video well we'll
keep that in mind not to be a shameless
plug or anything but I do share
everything I normally YouTube oh your
youtube or just follow Joe's YouTube
channel which he has which I watch all
the time hey you've never watched one of
these probing Paul videos so so there
just a few more questions I'm gonna try
and go through these quickly JP asks hi
Paul how is life as a parent should we
expect baby videos from now on I've
gotten a ton of questions about the baby
and comments and stuff and I wanted to
say thank you to everyone who has sent
their support and everything again I'm
not planning to make a ton of videos
about the baby
I did sort of a life update one a couple
weeks ago that's real life is a parent's
it's really hard in a lot of ways I
think for me the biggest challenge has
been lack of sleep
I am very used to getting a full night's
sleep and when I get a full night's
sleep I'm usually pretty okay to deal
with just about anything for the most
part except when I get frustrated making
videos but that's a separate thing point
being without a full night's sleep
or with sleep that's broken up and in
like two hours or three our junk s--
that is that has been the hardest thing
for me to deal with it makes simple
things harder and it's very trying and
taxing on like how much patience you
have and and and like just reasoning
abilities and like problem solving
abilities so that's been the biggest
challenge for me when it comes to life
as a parent other than that of course I
have a new baby baby daughter and she's
like awesome and beautiful and you know
you look at her and all those wonderful
things so yeah it's it's challenging for
sure but it's been very rewarding as
well and we're getting through it
question here from Francisco Illingworth
who says hey Paul don't know if you've
answered this before but where it is
excellent it started four videos come
from is there a funny story behind it
well you could look so like a month or
two ago I did a video about firewire and
capturing some of my old content that I
have on DV tapes and from there I linked
it to a couple of my old student films
from like back in like early 2000s this
is the beginning of one of them and so
I've had this in mind for quite some
time
I'm not going to tell you this is
exactly where it was taken from because
obviously I wouldn't do that but there
is a scene I will link in the video's
description from Bill &amp;amp; Ted's Excellent
Adventure it's right here but hopefully
that answers your question it is
inspired by the classic villain Ted's
Excellent Adventure starring Keanu
Reeves and Alex winter and the last
question here from epic anime who asks
how many times have you and Kyle smoked
the blunt for livestreams
it's a good question kind of
incriminating the answer would be zero
because rollin blunts takes time but
guys it's gonna wrap it up for this
episode of probing Paul thank you so
much for watching and of course if you
have questions for me to answer next
month or probably later in June leave
them down in the comment section below
thank you again for watching I am going
to go and take a nap goodbye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
