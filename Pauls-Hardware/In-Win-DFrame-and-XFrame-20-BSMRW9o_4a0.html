sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill we're now at anyone and anyone
always has some very fantastic amazing
and visually appealing cases to show off
so we're going to start off with the one
that's the most interesting I don't know
if I want to call this a case it's a
testbed it's kind of a little bit of
both but this is the x-ray 2.0 it's made
out of sand casted aluminum it is very
large as you can see but it supports of
course radiators it supports the in
winds special form factor power supply
that they've designed that's up here at
the top kind of in a an aggressive angle
so you can see the window inside and
everything this one of course is
outfitted with an excellently designed
water cooling system and it just looks
pretty sweet overall it's got special
features like a little drawer on the
bottom the pops out has all the
materials all of the pieces that you can
put on to you know hold things in place
whether it's the drives over on this
side it's got some IO up here it's got
this stand very sturdy stand out down at
the bottom that can actually mount on it
from two different locations so right
now it's in the vertical position so you
can show everything off but if you don't
want to do that you can actually mount
it in the horizontal position like this
one is over here as well and the stand
has a mount that will go down there so
you can use it actually like a test bed
and you know set it like that so you can
easily pop into pieces or remove them or
do what you'd normally do with the test
bed as for the X frame 2.0 we do not
have pricing or availability yet it's a
work in progress that's their kind of
proof of concept they have here this one
though they are working on it might be
available soon this is the D Frame 2.0
you guys remember the D frame right I
built my four way GTX Titan setup in
that one is badass this one now has gold
bling on it it's got a little piece you
can pop off right here to kind of lift
up the top so give you a little bit more
access to the inside tempered glass side
panel of course which will easily be
removed there and this system that's
being set up in here is just gorgeous
they got gold chromed up as a gold
canopy gold and chrome no it's just gold
and shiny all over the place they got a
- a gtx 980ti is in there as well as a
HyperX predator memory kit a HyperX
predator PCIe coordinating it drive and
water cooling fittings vibe it's power
looks gorgeous I was actually going to
sell along with the power supply it's
back here the Signature Series s3 to
1065 watt it's again is that special
form factor it's not ATX so it only
works with the into in win cases but
this is going to be sold altogether the
deep frame and the power supply for
about $1,500 it's a signature piece it's
supposed to be very nice so it's a
obviously with the gold accents on there
it's made for folks who got a little bit
of money to spend it also has some new
fans right there called Aurora fans they
are RGB LED of course and these are kind
of unique they're daisy chained together
I've never really seen that done with
fans so they have a separate controller
that can be used with the remote so you
can plug those in to control RGB LEDs
and the fact that can actually loop them
all together it's going to be very nice
for cable management I imagine if you're
short on fan headers or something like
that that could also help so the end
when Aurora fans look pretty nice
they're on display here in the D and the
D frame 2.0 case the Aurora fans should
be available in q3 no word on pricing
yet
I showed you some pretty high-end stuff
from in win but if you guys are looking
for something that maybe you actually
might built a system and how about the N
win 303 this is launching like next week
and our friend Andy asked me in Kyle how
much we thought this case would be worth
after showing us for instance tempered
glass side panel easily removable kind
of unique layout in there they've got
the power supply oriented this way on
the side and you can actually mount
radiator or triple fan support right
there all that together Kyle said maybe
160 170 I was like ah maybe 140 or so
89.9 MSRP for this guy right here this
is a custom painted version but it's
going to be available in white as well
as in black and finally over here we
have an assortment of what looks like
different cases right but these are
actually these all versions of the in
win 509 that a case modding competition
last week they case motors that are all
shown here basically had three days
eight hours a day so 24 hours total to
take the 509 and kind of just go ham
with it do whatever they wanted and this
is what they came up with now anyone
gave me this special token it's
yellow it's actually for gambling but
I'm told that this is actually worth
more because I am being treated as media
so I'm going to actually I've already
carefully looked at each of these cases
going down the line and I was really
really not sure which one I was going to
vote for this one was pretty close this
one's called state of the arts it's by
running with scissors Daniel Harper and
Dave Alcock I really like this when the
LEDs were nice this one it was very
visually appealing you know it's got all
these bullets all over it so that's
pretty aggressive water-cooler my bets
bar on this one this is my team down
under Stuart Tonks and Ryan Hooper it
actually has an external backpack with a
radiator on it three radiators on it I
believe in a bunch of bands that is
connected around the back there with the
water cooling was very tempted than that
one too I mean look it they got these
they got some reservoirs out front and
everything but you know what it came
down to was this one down on the end
this was a sleeper I walked by it at
first but it's I just it's very clean
it's very polished it's very finished
this one's by kun mod Coonans free a
apologies if I'm not pronouncing that
correctly but I really like the internal
work here maybe I'm kind of a sucker for
the flow indicators that could be it
they got the thicker I believe ptg
tubing in there fits power fittings
again an asus strix graphics card so I
think ultimately my votes got to go for
this one right here so there we go my
vote has been cast but that's going to
wrap it up for this in win booth
coverage guys I'll be back again very
soon with more Computex 2016 coverage
one final shout out and thank you to my
sponsors fractal design MSI and g.skill
we'll see you guys soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
