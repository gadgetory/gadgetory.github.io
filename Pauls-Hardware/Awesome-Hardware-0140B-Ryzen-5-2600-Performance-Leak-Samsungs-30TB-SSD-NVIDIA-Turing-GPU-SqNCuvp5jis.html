little bit sorry Hudson ticketed lessen
the blow exactly
alright we should be light to both now
oh cool so hello everyone
wait wait wait I gotta find my serious
face mmm serious face do the show hello
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
hello this is a live show about
technology that is streamed every week
on Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
as well as to our YouTube channels yes
we've already done the first half of
this show episode 140 - a on Kyle's
channel which is called bit wit that is
linked in the video description so if
you didn't watch it maybe you should
check it out we talked about technology
some IndieGoGo stuff and some other BS I
wasn't really paying that much attention
to and that brings us to right now we've
also been drinking some beers so
occasionally we drink beer and we say
like Cheers
and welcome to the show yeah do that
thanks for being here everyone and also
every once a while we use foul language
so if you have children or otherwise are
offended by that sort of thing then both
don't watch our show do you were given
they were given at least a four second
warning should have seen that coming
all right okay um I've forgotten fingers
what we do now 193 we're 793 71 okay I'm
pounding it cows patties beer kyle is
pounding
that's a porter - it's not a very it's
only it's like a 5.2% porter so that's
beers well done Kyle thank you thank you
now you need to get more beer you're
right
oh boy ooh okay I'm good I'm good I'm
ready for round three cows gonna
retrieve Willard beer and a big
shout-out to everyone watching us on
twitch TV / awesome hardware we've
broken a thousand live viewers
this is unprecedented precedented it's a
milestone and it's time to celebrate I'm
gonna also pound the rest of my beer
which is far less impressive but there
it is I have just finished my orgasmic
orange from Indian Wells Brewing Company
which was not bet it was heavy
fortunately I'm moving on to something
that I know I will enjoy which is double
nut brown engage here this is from
mammoth Brewing Company that's there in
NorCal how do I go to mammoth now
actually I haven't gone yet this year
yeah yeah it's her mammoth oh yeah
double nut brown I also like the
hazelnut brace the nut brown from from
rogue no that's hazelnut L Smith from oh
yes yes yes the bottle sorry speaking of
this bottle opener that I'm about to use
to open this beer if you guys enjoy the
content that we produce and you want to
help support us and also get yourself
some nice merch check out my store
Paul's Herbert at MIT where you can get
this thumb screw black zip-up hoodie as
well as lots of other merchandise I'm
wearing I'm wearing this right now and I
can tell you it is incredibly
comfortable and high-quality it looks
and I love it
I want to be in your jacket so soft yeah
other stuff also available there so if
you want a mug or a mouse pad or
anything like that check it out my stuff
also can buy stuff on Kyle's store which
is located at bit wit dot tech slash
store also lots of high quality
merchandise sure shirts mugs and pint
glasses dammit mums during my speech
already so thanks to you guys for 20
minutes and if you buy stuff we will
shout your name at the end at the end of
this half of the show my follow me and
express our thankfulness hey I need to
prove that I can pour a beer and not
make it all terrible right
yes proof well cuz you have a normal
beer now this is proof you know your
stuff the orgasmic
whatever was like totally jacked up it
was it was a chemical in mates because
that was that's exactly how you poured
the last one yeah yeah I did not do much
over there okay you are relieved you are
relieved of your of your accusations I
am
alright cool um what's what's first
first off we the first segment is hot
and heavy hardware yeah so we're gonna
talk about some computer hardware you
know usually hot and heavy hardware it's
about computer hardware that you can buy
and that's not necessarily the case this
time but what the hell we do segments so
I had to break things up somehow the AMD
risin 526 hundred at least an
engineering sample of the horizons 520
600 excuse me has apparently appeared on
the Geekbench database so as is often
the case with early unreleased Hardware
people get their hands on it and they
test it they test it on systems that are
connected to the internet with software
that reports the results of tests to the
Internet and what do you know you end up
with early results like this so the
actual processor name is listed here is
AMD risin ZD 2600 BB m6 8 AF underscore
blah blah the 2600 is there in the name
though it is a 6 quart 12 threat
processor so pretty safe bet that this
was a rise in to 2600 CPU that was
tested here it's listed with a base
frequency of 3.6 gigahertz boost clock
3.8 gig arts so 1,600 credit successor
1600 successor and the 1600 is one of
the most popular and I've recommended it
many many times to really awesome 6 for
12 Terra processor and has often been
really really well priced as well so
this is pretty exciting for anyone who's
looking forward to the launch of risin 2
which has been promised already by AMD
in April I feel like it's April 12th but
is that great let ya
I don't remember anyway I'm sure will
confirm that soon but Verizon too is
gonna be based on Zen plus so Zen is the
microarchitecture that AMD first was was
their first big microarchitecture launch
in five six seven years back in 20 last
year and it's it's pretty good they've
improved upon it and also done a bit of
a - a bit of a process shrink I should
say from 14 nanometer which was a
manufacturing process for original Zen
into twelve ninety beer now
there's also going to be Zen - that has
been talked about by AMD and that's a
seven nanometer process that's further
out in the future so we're not talking
about that quite yet but there is some
potential confusion between Rison -
versus n - risin - uses n plus twelve
nanometer and it's launching in April so
the exciting thing here is that this
processor 2600 3.4 gigahertz base clock
3.8 gigahertz boosts clock please bear
in mind this is all early information
and this is all based just on this
Geekbench score so you know this is
we're not verifying this AMD hasn't come
out and said this is all true but it
seems to be pretty reasonable for what's
being said here now the actual score is
what we're talking about here because
it's pretty impressive 4269 is the score
here now there's also I have here for
comparison just a baseline score for
horizon 5 1600 this is just the non
overclocked out of the box score which
has a base clock of 3.2 gigahertz and a
boost clock of 3.6 gigahertz so the 2600
has a 200 megahertz frequency benefit
right out of the box over the 1600 out
of the box however we're not necessarily
looking at just that same linear
performance increase we're looking at
perhaps in instructions per clock
improvement as well which iswhich is
which is cool so this score 4269 versus
the
1,600 score of three thousand eight
hundred ninety six is a nine point five
percent increase the multi-core score
here of twenty thousand one hundred and
two versus the sixteen hundred score of
seventeen thousand four hundred thirty
three is a fifteen point three percent
increase and pair minds the book the the
actual frequency difference if you're
just looking at a percentage difference
is about five point five percent so if
you were looking at a linear increase in
clock speed of a five percent boost then
you would expect a five percent
performance increase if you're looking
at the same architecture in the same
instructions per clock so the deduction
here is that those rise into seems to
have better instructions per clock then
then rise in one right so that's cool
and you would hope so note hope so
because it's a it's because they have
had more time to refine the architecture
and also that they're doing again a
little bit of a node shrink from 40
nanometer down to twelve nanometer which
can improve died area as well as
efficiency a lot of the time so is a
second trend rising also the one whether
like improving the memory channels and
and higher speed memory support for for
the platform so technically like I I
mean you would again that's once
something you would hope and probably
also something that you would expect AMD
to put some focus on because memory some
amount on it does have such an impact on
risings performance you would think that
because you know the memory
manufacturers like you look at G skills
press releases there every couple weeks
or every month they come out with the
new press release that says G skill has
now launched the fastest memory ever we
now have a forty seven hundred speed kit
or whatever they're putting out yeah
and that means a G skill is putting out
memory that's when paired with a
processor that supports that speed will
hit that it reliably hit that every time
yeah but the processor needs to be able
to hit that
it's definitely it seems to be worth
AMD's while to invest more and more
stability for higher speed memory
because if that's really gonna scale up
the performance then that makes them
look better against the Intel yeah and
also it provides a wider range of
compatibility for anyone who's looking
for memory to pair with their new
horizon to processor mm-hmm so they also
mentioned in the article is just the
comparison here that if we're looking at
a 200 megahertz frequency increase with
the 1600 from the from the 1600 to the
2600 that you might reasonably assume
that the same frequency increase would
apply to other CPUs in the lineup so if
the 1800 X is going to be replaced and
rise in to with the 2800 X right then
maybe we'll see a 4.2 gigahertz clock
speed with that as opposed to the 4
gigahertz the 1800 X has and then of
course also to be mentioned here is that
precision boost 2 is a refinement of
original precision boost that AMD has
worked on with rise into and that also
could be affecting this performance so
we might might not be looking at a
straight instructions per clock
improvements or this might not all be
attributable directly to that it might
also be to efficiency improvements of
precision boost as far as how its
ramping up and ramping down and and yeah
that kind of think so of course more to
be talked about with that as we get
closer to launch but still cool little
story there and hopefully some hopefully
that plays out because we're really
looking it's a a decent amount of IPC
performance improvement then that means
AMD is going to be even further pushing
Intel when it comes to competition I
feel like I feel like the the 2600 at
3.8 gigahertz have a boost overclocking
that we should be able to see over 4
gigahertz which if you guys remember
risin 1 only the 1800 X was like one of
the few chips that was like a surefire
way to hit 4 gigahertz 4.0 gigahertz on
Rison on
before platform and now potentially
we're gonna see rising five chips
topping the clock speeds that we were
seeing with an 1800 X which is cool and
that's one of the things that they
emphasize at the AMD CES tech day and
stuff that rising to was gonna emphasize
higher clock speeds throughout and at
better overclocking performance to sort
of catch up with ya the types of
frequencies that we're seeing with Intel
platforms so said and you would expect
that also to narrow the gap when it
comes to GPU performance which it is
niche when it comes to comparisons as it
is when it comes to like coffee like
versus Rison but it's still one of the
areas where Andy likes behind but you
expect it to catch up a bit
excuse me if this is actually the case
yeah let's move on though to next story
samsung has managed to cram 30 terabytes
of SSD storage onto a single 2.5 inch I
want I want not oh there it is I don't
want the price though yeah so this is
undeniably and and unquestionably an
enterprise drive so the samsung PM 1 6 4
3 is what we're looking at right here
enterprise drives always have catchy
names for the their SKUs thirty point
seven two terabytes of SSD and a single
2.5 inch drive as well as 40 gigs of DDR
for what yeah this SSD has more ddr4
than like the majority of the people
watching this video right now the hood
like 32 gigs is what I have in most of
my systems that are that I use for video
editing and stuff like that so this 40
oh my god 40 gigs of DDR fours that are
integrated there as well it's for cash
yeah what's up it's powered by nine of
flash controllers driving 32 one
terabyte packages of NAND flash each
package contains 16 layer NAND mean 3
bit per cell v-nand 512 gigabits per
package 40 gigs of DDR 4 memory also
is in there and that's kind of weird too
according to the article
those are eight gigabit chips built
using through-silicon vias or via I've
never heard of this before I'm just
repeating what the article says you know
TSVs but basically it's so that then the
ddr4 ram chips can be stacked vertically
they're assembled into ten packages each
of four gigabytes the interface is
twelve gigabits per second SAS or serial
Attached Guzzi actual performance four
hundred thousand IAP reed which is
pretty nice fifty thousand IAP s'right
and did hero just move the thank yous no
it's okay he's good thanks oh he's
trying to swipe it yeah what are you
doing dead name I'm just I'm just
worried if he if he bumps the camera I
thought he did but he went back down hey
he's doing a better here's fine yes him
yeah society fifty thousand random right
i ops 21,000 random read I ops so you
know read and write performance so
twenty-one hundred megabytes megabytes
per second sequential read seventeen
hundred megabytes per second so clincial
rate so that's right up there with a
pretty decent not the highest end I'm
not too and MDMA drive like a 960 pro
but right up there with the
middle-of-the-road ones so that's that's
pretty good especially considering the
the overall capacity of the drive
durability is one full drive rate per
day basically 30 terabyte drive rights
per day over the five-year lifetime of
the drive and apparently they just
started manufacturing these back in
January so they're not available yet but
they've announced to confirm the 30
terabyte version a 15 point three six
terabyte version seven point six eight
terabyte version 3 point 8 4 terabyte
for effect I should just round these
right terabyte one for Tara buy two
terabyte one terabyte and eight hundred
gigabytes essentially it's really one
point nine to three anyway no person
available the availability yet which is
what I was most sad about but what I did
be said when
it comes yes and I find out how much one
of its Enterprise its enterprise it's
beyond the reach of most of us but it's
it's fun to look at these drives of you
look what they were able to do with that
and it's 2.5 inch drive that what will
we see 2.5 n trickle down to the main
terabyte SSDs can be more readily
available to us for that we need an and
prices overall to come down indeed and
who knows when that's actually gonna
happen but they've been more reasonable
compared to memory prices which is good
I did price speculation on this and this
is totally just just like like some some
napkin you know math or whatever but the
Samsung for a terabyte SSDs like the
mainstream consumer ones right now on
new nvme or and we're talking SATA 2.5
inch SSDs are 1400 to 1800 dollars for a
4 terabyte one and that's they have one
on sale anyway so I averaged that to
about $1600 right which is about four
hundred four hundred dollars per
terabyte average so times 30 terabytes
would be twelve thousand dollars through
this trip and that's on the really low
end that's comparing it to the prices of
mainstream consumer dress so it's gonna
be way more enterprise drives typically
cost double that yeah like inside
Enterprise Drive was like twenty four
hundred dollars for the four terabyte
version so anyway this is really
expensive stuff but it's cool to know
they're able to do it and hopefully at
some point in the future will have
access to something like that so the
technology and you don't have to work in
a data set data and dater data in danger
centered now your data centers to
actually dagger is gonna date brick with
that custom alright let's talk about
Intel and they're discrete GPU yes
for anyone who is concerned about
graphics card prey and cryptocurrency
mining and all that kind of stuff
maybe the introduction of another player
in the discrete GPU market might help
that so Intel unveiling some of this
information just recently which they did
at the I Triple E international solid
state circuits convention I'm sorry
solid-state circuits conference the is
SSC
held by the I Triple E in San Francisco
at San Francisco broke from all the
second SF CA USA Earth okay
anyway bTW that's that's where Intel
Intel revealed a little bit more info
about this and I'm not gonna go into a
whole lot of detail again this this
particle is linked in the videos we
explaining all of this in the next what
all this stuff means a vague idea you
guys have time but it's a base of 14
nanometer lithography I can at least say
that is it based on the bago graphics no
it is not because you know is robbery
mastermind behind our live Radeon
technologies group does now work for
Intel and and that's a good question
because that's the the thought that you
might have and initially looking at this
article was like oh is this all the
stuff that Raja has been working on and
answer is probably not because the way
that development of a product like this
works you don't get to the point that
they're at with this in months within
the amount of time that Raja has worked
with Intel they have probably been
getting him up to speed with what
they've been doing with this development
exactly and then he's probably been
coming in and back no no do you
understand you have to do it this way
but his things probably here zone and
then there then their pride like dude
Vegas just fucking lame so that's it
okay very political here point B point B
there is a little bit more information
on what Intel's working on so that's
pretty cool what they displayed and they
actually did have a prototype that they
demoed at the events was a two chip
solution the first chip contains the key
components of the GPU itself and a
system agent keeps on one yeah yeah the
two chips that were that were paired
with each other to tie to both do
separate tasks okay basically rather
than something like an SOC the
integrated everything altogether so yeah
the GPU and a system agent on one chip
second chip was an FPGA or field
programmable gate array the interfaces
with the system bus and that probably
goes along with Intel's
desire to make this flexible solution
that they can sell to as many people as
possible with the ability to flexibly
integrate the GPU and and and in the way
that they want to not to put too fine a
point on the GPU component itself is
based on intel's current gen9
architecture so it features three
execution unit clusters but we should
mention if you're looking at through
this article and be like execution units
like my GPU has this many extreme
processors or whatever like that there's
really no viable like comparison right
now between this and like current
generation discrete graphics cards from
Intel I'm sorry from Nvidia or AMD it's
really just sort of comparing this to
what they've been working on with their
IGP use up done that there is a double
clock mechanism mechanism that they talk
about that doubles the boost clock
speeds beyond what the current gen 9 EU
can handle with Intel I GPUs so that's
cool to know that cool to know that
they're working on stuff to vastly
increase the turbo frequency beyond that
there's not a whole lot to say we're
probably probably looking at two to
three years before Intel actually
releases that discrete GPU that you can
go out and buy yourself but it is in the
works and I imagine as they move along
with developed developments at certain
times they'll let us know how they're
doing and hopefully in the long run this
can contribute to more variety more
options when it comes to graphics cards
in the marketplace and usually that's
good for everyone yeah usually not high
percent here but we go to the the next
you know I want to predict the future I
I have a strong feeling though that
until eventually tap into gaming GPUs oh
yeah I have a feeling that like that is
really good for all of us that are just
the crossover with cryptocurrency now is
like the development of graphics cards
up til now has had a variety of
implementations like it's it for a while
now it's not just been making make a 3d
accelerated chip for gaming
there have been other things you can do
with it when it comes to general-purpose
GPU compute stuff but they introduced an
introduction of cryptocurrency as well
plus I have to imagine the you know
skyrocket skyrocketing prices of
graphics cards has made it an even more
tantalizing market for a company like
Intel who has the means when it comes to
developments to get into yeah okay let's
move on last story here on hot and heavy
hardware is from iki a sincere and
heartfelt apology for their ex 399
thread repair water blocks okay are you
aware of this no I missed it I did a
video on the xc-99 tender for water
blocking it was actually Minoans sided
with several like catastrophic failures
of various things that happened around
here and I ended up actually making a
video about how everything went wrong
rather than an actual block like like
review like it like an actual testing of
the product or whatever that's more
interesting but fortunately others did
put the ek supremacy Evo thread repair
edition CP water block through its paces
and what they actually discovered was
that was not really all that great of a
performer no in some cases as much as 10
to 20 percent less performance than what
you would get was something like just a
standard UK water uh no like a standard
like you know all the Allen ones for
water cooling descending of a thread
Ripper yeah it depended though and there
were different reviews that we've got
different results but basically ek has
acknowledged that the performance of
this unit was not up to par and
certainly when compared with some other
purpose-built
thread Ripper blocks was really below
the level of performance that would then
that would be expected that's not to say
it's done function not functional or
anything like that and if you do happen
to have one it's not not gonna work for
you but won't be level of performance is
nuts as was expected so I mean what they
have done is they are relaunching
a new version of the block that will be
available very soon and here's here's
the actual side by set so first off
there's you rise in thread ripper and
you know thread ripper has four Rison
cores for rise and dies that are here
here here and here right sort of spread
out yeah so this was their original
design which is actually basically just
the sort of a copy over there
there's ek supremacy Evo design which is
used in intel blocks and that kind of
thing and the way that works is you've
got a unit that goes on top of this and
sort of a narrow gap that shoots the
water down right here at the center of
this fin array and it pushes out across
the fins on either side and it's pretty
effective design but not necessarily as
effective for thread Ripper right due to
the position of the device and where the
most effective cooling was happening
with this so this is the new design that
they've done so you can see for example
you know they've actually changed the
direction of the flow from being 90
degrees basically from this direction to
this direction you can also see a gap in
the center and I'm guessing what they're
gonna have is that they're gonna have
the jet plate or whatever shoot the
water down across this way and that'll
go out this way and then of course
accumulates in the sides and goes out
the out hole and that's how that works
so yeah they've redesigned its they've
made it better and they put out this
this actual apology page which is on
their news website which is linked in
the video description where they said
hey basically we're saying we
acknowledge that the first product we
launched is not that great engine the
first product that they launched
existing blocks are on a fair discount
as they said I looked at the website
fifty-three dollars if he wants the
older crappy earth Evo thread Ripper
water block if you're looking to build a
water-cooled system but you're don't
want the best performance so it's like
what's your feeling I guess yeah but I
mean I
I'm sure they'll probably sell them at
that price because you typically bought
blocks like this cost upwards of $100
yeah 74 dollars for the all nickel
version so a little bit more but still
discounted they have a new set of blocks
coming out pictures of that or kind of
at the top here is there and that's sort
of like anyone who bought the old shitty
one gets a free upgrade or you know even
further discounting because they you
know what I mean yeah so there's um you
might be you might be one of two people
so the old crappy design they used for
the the block itself and then they've
also been developing mono blocks and a
mono block covers the CPU and is usually
larger um also also do a liquid cooling
over the vrm to the power delivery which
is very useful especially for the high
end boards for like X 399 the next two
ninety nine because if you overclock the
v-rooms can can generate a lot of heat
and keeping them cool can be effective
for maintaining high overclocks so the
only mono block that they launched with
the old crappy design was the Asus one
so the asus rog Zenith they launched a
mono block for that had the old design
if you purchased that you can apply for
a free upgrade to the new version of
that nice if you bought the just water
block then you can get a twenty five
euro or twenty five dollar coupon code
and that is if you bought it before the
24th of November 2017 now I'm not sure
why there's that date cut off of the
24th of November which is also pre Black
Friday which is kind of interesting I'm
not sure if they cut off sales at that
point because they knew that it wasn't
it wasn't working properly or what but
it seems like their extension of
helpfulness to people who bought just
the block is not quite as as generous as
what they're doing to people bought the
monoblock
right but maybe this ties in with how
many of them actually sold or when they
sold them or that kind of thing
so you know anyway point is there's a
new version and it's better and I guess
they said they were sorry okay
let's move on to tech news which is
roughly the same as what we've just been
talking about but it's different it's a
bit more the same good stuff alright so
here we go we've been talking a decent
amount about the AMD APU that just
recently launched in the past couple
weeks the 2200 G and 2400 G and there's
play questions from people who either
already bought a motherboard but we're
waiting to buy a CPU or who are buying a
motherboard that's maybe been sitting on
a shelf for a while or maybe isn't
updated because motherboards that were
sold say over the past year since Rison
first launched have a BIOS that is
compatible with all the first generation
rise and chips your rise in threes rice
and thousand rise in sevens and that's a
decent number of processors but there
are our new ap use that include Vega
graphics which also uses the video outs
on a lot of motherboards that haven't
been used up till now
now there have actually been some ap use
that have launched on this platform that
use not Zen architecture they are under
the is at Bristol Ridge I'm blanking on
this right now
yes Bristol reach so I feel like I'm not
explaining this well if you have a
motherboard with a BIOS that's older and
not compatible with these new rise in AP
use then you're kind of in a situation
where you have a motherboard you have an
APU
but you can't get them to work together
because if you take the new APU and put
it in the motherboard the motherboards
like I don't recognize this is is old
and Maya BIOS to Seoul now that
motherboard might be perfectly
compatible with that new APU right but
until you can update its BIOS software
thing then it won't recognize it and you
can't update the BIOS in most situations
unless you have a processor to install
to get the motherboard functional
to update it so that's kind of the
catch-22 that some people is this very
similar to the fact that like when I
first popped my review sample APU into
my be 350 motherboard I got a black
screen and it didn't really like boot
until I popped like my 1800 X and booted
fine updated the BIOS and then once I
swap that out for the APU it worked
perfectly fine yes same sort of that has
absolutely the the exact situation yeah
now you were in a situation and we're
like let me take my 1800 X over here
exactly and install it real quick Tori
in order to update the BIOS and get it
get everything set up the windows people
don't have the luxury of doing yeah most
people don't happen to have any other
and for CTU lying around so what this
article is talking about is that AMD has
has started a program that will
basically loan you a temporary CPU and
actually it is an APU which means it's a
CPU with graphics in order to update
your motherboard so you can use your new
Rison 2200 G or 2400 G or maybe another
CPU that they come out in the future
beyond that right I'm imagining this
will also apply to rising to stuff
because we're going to have the same
situation over in rising 2 processors
come out because rising 2 processors
will be compatible with existing X 370
and be 350 motherboards and also a a320
whatever that stupid one is but you'll
need that BIOS update so Wow prior to
now your options were what I would
usually recommend to people is find a
local PC repair shop because that's
usually the best bet you can go in there
bring your motherboard be like hey can
you update my BIOS right and by the way
if you're a PC repair shop owner or you
run that I would highly recommend that
you offer this as a free service to
people yeah because it's a simple thing
for you to do it takes 10 minutes maybe
right and that will get people to come
back to your store I would just say
consider it or at most charge 5 or 10
bucks for it
yeah I've heard Pete I've heard of PC
repair shops charging you know 5 10 20
maybe 40 bucks for it nothing that's a
bear but depending on the situation
but yeah you bring it in there they pop
the CPU and they update the BIOS in them
and then you're good to go
right other than that your option was to
happen to have a motherboard that was
fancy and newer and has a BIOS updating
mechanism that you can do without a CPU
and memory install which includes some
ASUS motherboards and I know some
gigabyte motherboards can do it I'm not
sure beyond that if any of the other
manufacturers have integrated that but
that's more rare so it's harder to to
say here's what you should do yeah
anyway the CPU that they lend out is the
Bristol Ridge APU the Asics 9,500 which
is a dual-core 3.5 gigahertz processor
they will send it to you once you've
provided a qualifying apu serial number
and other information I'm not sure what
the other information is the street
price of that apu that they will send
you a 72 dollars in case you're
wondering
they will also send you RMA paperwork so
you can return the cpu after you've
updated your bios so what cpu is it
sorry on the model it is the a 690 $572
ASA a 690 500 it's Bristol Ridge so 80
so it uses piledriver whatever that
whatever the last name excavators then
they had bulldozer piledriver excavator
I forget which version but whatever the
final revision is the last generation
has been converted to a name for it yeah
they made they made a name for
compatible APU that this'll make those
chips specifically just for this no
that's it's been out for a while that's
this has been out since since rise and
lunched oh yeah
there have been ap use that you can get
on the import platform using the
adjuster you would just never recommend
them because they're using using seven
six seven year old architecture and
they're not that great so okay yeah
thank you okay s+ bulldoze our pallet
piledriver excavator and ass blaster
that's why I kept it they'll send you
army paperwork so you can return the
station share them after you've updating
your biases station they do not require
a deposit or credit card
at least according to the article for
right now so it's a little bit on the
honor system but if you guys happen to
take it to take advantage of this from
AMD please return the processor because
you know I'd be a jerk yeah okay moving
on don't abuse don't abused their
kindness basically let's talk about AMD
epic Romo
rumors and this is a PC perspective
article which is derived from a WCC F
tech article so so it's evil part you
just really usually WCC F Tech we'd be
like hey you know we're not so sure
about this PC perspective is usually
pretty solid it's not their credit but
the fact that Ryan I'm sorry actually
this is a Scott as articles from Scott
the fact that Scott decided this was
viable enough to bring over from WCC f
Tech though I think indicates that it's
fairly reliable and also fairly
interesting so Andy's epic is their code
name for their enterprise level server
processors basically the enterprise
version of AMD thread Ripper and those
are based on the same rise in cores as
thread Ripper it's a different platform
but a lot of the hardware a lot of the
core technology is functionally the same
so as we are expecting Rison to as we're
expecting them to to come out we're also
expecting you know probably a parallel
improvements or updates or upgrades on
the epic platform as well so Rome is the
codename of the next generation platform
and according to these rumors Rome will
be based on the seven nanometer
manufacturing process and what does that
do Emel include 64 core processor
designs so 64 cores and are having 28
threads on a single package processor
which is which is pretty huge pretty
amazing right now epic goes up to 32
cores and 64 threads and thread Ripper
of course the high end desktop but still
made for consumers
sixteen core thirty-two thread
processors which are super awesome in
and of themselves and we've kind of
wondered like will they bring the 32
course read option or something like
that to the thread Ripper platform and
based on this my guess at this point
would be probably not going beyond 16
cores with the current generation but if
they launch an updated series of CPUs
for thread or pair like a thread refer
to or something like that that's still
compatible with the existing tr4 socket
and everything then you might see a 32
core high-end desktop mainstream CPU
from them that's it that's a that's a
viable possibility but anyway the huge
thing here is that they're shrinking
from 40 nanometers down to 7 nanometers
so that's that's half that's cutting the
the size of the manufacturing process in
half from 14 down to seven again please
bear in mind this is not the same as
rising 2 which is based on Zen Plus
which is 12 nanometer but there are two
different dyes for this Rome a product
line one is a 12 core per die part so
you have 4 by 4 with 48 cores per
package let me says yeah ok cool so yeah
each each of the fourth like you
remember thread repair with 4 dies yeah
1 2 3 4 each of those dies there's 12 on
each we'd have 12 cores and all four of
the dice would make 48 course total
right and then there'd be a 16 core
which would be 64 64 cores per package
with 16 cores per day now my my sort of
trickle-down deduction from this here is
like alright right now thread Ripper is
based on 4 or if your 8 core Rison dies
so if this is true then Rome is being
based on 16 core dies so that would make
me assume that not rising to because
we're again rising to is n plus which is
top 14 12 nanometer but whatever this
accessorize into it the next-gen after
that yeah would potentially have a
single 16 corridor by the sands which
which is like taking your 8 core little
die that so many of the rise in
derivatives the current gen rise and
derivatives are based on and doubling
the amount of cores on it well well
while having the the manufacturing
process sighs so that's that's yeah
that's pretty cool the cool thing about
there and as Scott also points out in
the article having those two SKUs a 16
core and a 12 core would would greatly
enhance their yields per wafer because
you have a wafer with a bunch of dies
and they cut them all out of it and they
test them all and some are work better
than others that means the one that
worked ones work the best would be the
16 core ones those those would go in the
64 core processors or the 16 core rise
in three 3,800 plus or whatever you
hundred X or whatever you want to call
it but then you'd also have the ability
to harvest harvest dies that didn't
perform as well or they had some
quarters that weren't fully functional
to get 12 core dies out of that matter
that that's better for your yields that
means you have more viable dice on each
wafer that come out of it and that's
always good for making money as a CPU
manufacturer okay
Rome is due in 2019 so we're looking at
next year nice cool all right finally
last story here isn't about Nvidia
touring and we talked a little bit last
week in the rumor and speculation and
really sketchy kind of way about what
might have been Nvidia amp here which
we're talking about is maybe the
in-between follow-up for the next
generation of GPUs that Nvidia might be
coming out with this article would seem
to indicate that maybe some of those
rumors were based on touring rather than
ampere we can't say at this point one
percent that ampere isn't actually a
thing but because Reuters actually has
reported on this
it does seem like Turing is a thing and
it definitely seems like this is
possibly what the rumors from last week
we're talking about as opposed to the
rumored and pure series of made for
gaming GPUs these ways we might skip and
purer and purer might not be a thing at
all and peer might just be a made up a
made up rumor that turns out to be
nonsense I see or these could be both
going on at the same time we're not sure
now I watched again a cameras next video
earlier today about this and gamers
Nexus apparently got tipped off to this
a while ago I have been dropping touring
peeps hints and some of their videos and
stuff like this which is very fancy
still does not completely rule out the
possibility of an ampere gaming based
GPU but Turing does appear to be focused
more on cryptocurrency mining which hate
might be just just as good a news as a
new game series of gaming GPUs to gamers
as it is because if there's gonna be
anything that seriously provides
competition to gaming graphics cards
being used for mining it's gonna be
purpose-built GPUs that are made for
mining that are better at it and more
efficient and that's the only thing
that'll that'll work for them like the
talk that's been done of like oh we're
gonna make mining graphics cards that
are made for mining and we're gonna take
the video outs off of them and that kind
of thing like that's a means of the
graphics card manufacturer minimizing
the amount of money that they invest
into the and into producing the graphics
card but that's less appealing to miners
because miners look are looking at the
whole lifecycle of the cart they're
looking at buying it now mining with it
for X amount of time to get this many as
many hashes as they can right and then
selling it when they're done with it
sure and they're probably to sell to a
gamer and if they have a mining specific
card that has no video outs that reduces
the viability of reselling it obviously
this is a universal or anything like
that but
point being touring is named after the
British scientist Alan Turing you may be
familiar he's credited the team of
mathematicians the Nazi enigma
cryptography also the Turing test which
is often used to determine whether
you're a robot or a human sorry my dogs
are freaking out I wish anymore you
sound like robots hello mrs. York Turing
task brief brief interruption by dogs
bork bork bork bork all right so um
couple quotes from the article here
NVIDIA Turing could be manufactured a
low enough cost against geforce branded
products and in high enough scales to
help bring down their prices and save
the PC gaming ecosystem it could have an
ASIC like disruptive impact on the
graphics card market and that's
referring to the original the the
original popularity of mining Bitcoin on
GPUs which was thwarted by the
introduction of a six which were much
more efficient at mining Bitcoin which
killed the viability of mining it with
GPUs 20 came back months altcoins and
aetherium and other coins that could be
mined with GB was again started to get
more popular right combined with also
the increased acceptance and
profitability of crypto mining okay
there's no word on which GPU
architecture Turing would be based on
whether it's Pascal current generation
or Volta next generation Nvidia is
expected to launch its entire family of
next generation GeForce GTX 2000 series
Volta graphics cards in 2018 okay that's
that's a very broad statement but hey
techpowerup they probably know what it I
feel like they were do I mean it's been
like
two years since the gtx titan launched
yeah it's been way too long so they're
gonna come out with something they have
something in the works we'll keep
talking about the possibilities until we
can say yes this is exactly what they
will do and it's it's gotta be hard
though to be in video right now right or
any GPU manufacturer no it doesn't it's
really easy no okay where the art
products is selling off the shelves for
way more than they're intended to be
sold okay
i mean i need to market it towards a
gaming audience which they've
traditionally done in the years past
I mean GeForce has always been sort of a
gaming forward brand or a family of
product and for them to be like you know
alright and like Jensen come up on stage
and his leather jacket
we got the to the 2020 or the the 2080
here retailing for the low low price of
$1,300 like like zero collapsing body
it's like the one guy definitely how do
you market it a mean eccentric GPU right
now they certainly had are they gonna do
they should have a vested interest in
maintaining their audience of gamers
because that's what they've built their
business up on yeah yeah and you know I
I I would expect and I don't mean this
and to be insulting in any way it's
anyone who mines cryptocurrency the
people who Mayan cryptocurrency are
going to go where they can get the most
efficient mining and the best bang for
their buck and if it turns out that the
hardware market veers in a direction
where suddenly cryptocurrency miners are
going to be investing in these products
that are made for mining versus these
products that are made for gaming that's
when we will see gaming graphics cards
become more reasonable in price I hope
so
and I think that would be the ideal
situation because then cryptocurrency
miners who want to mind cryptocurrency
and make money and more power to them
for everyone wins making money can rely
products and do what they want and not
affect the price of gaming graphics
cards for people who just want to buy
and play some games right so hopefully
that's what we came out with speaking of
gaming graphics cards though my final
segments up to
is a little it's kind of a cop-out but I
I just wanted to go shopping with you
guys what do you think let's do it let's
go shop we talked about the prices of
stuff so what does stuff cost
particularly use or Jeff we've jumped
over here to new egg so let's type in
gtx 1070 let's go I want to see what it
says right now
oh I forget how no egg works where is
where's video cards got a desk two
peripherals yeah no good components you
have to go to the car I was an
assistance we used to work here we used
to work here now we don't even know how
to use the website that's top graphics
cards we're drilling down our let's cut
power our search is good gotta use the
power search of course who wants to have
some that's what I always do I used to
make our search you can be like look at
all of these different video cards that
I can choose from oh my god I don't know
heroes like I was touching my leg oh you
just he wanted butt scratches touch oh
we're looking at 1080 sure than you yeah
see what tiny bees cost on new egg right
now 800 now if you ever go shopping on
new egg there's these radio buttons at
the top there's new egg and there's all
sellers the all sellers radio button
that's basically like Hitler you want to
avoid that Oh like screw that go with
new iPad marketplace so as you guys are
all assholes
that's actually oh those are all out of
stock okay so we've selected new egg
here so we're only getting legit new egg
offerings and we've sorted by Luis
lowest price and they're all out of
stock I am so sad so new egg nights so
maybe maybe maybe you should keep the
radial option open for all sellers why
are they cannot keep anything in stock
and you click on all sellers if there
aren't even any SKUs here like you like
you should be seeing every brand Asus GT
Strix GTX 10 anyway but at a stock here
but why candy and why EVGA there's
nothing all right
they're just completely drained dry
removing so that means all of these are
from different sellers than Newegg right
yeah yeah not New Age and these are all
eight $900 so if you view details we
have an $800 skirt all right 800 bucks
right now you can get a 10 84 Wow looks
like it's in stock and Add to Cart from
platinum micro comm sounds like it sound
like they sell robot hookers that's what
it sounds like to me anyway that's the
low low price for the $800 1080 good how
about a tea I got for it at ti right now
11 handle 11 Hyundai is no egg doesn't
have any can I get any legit sales from
nuoc so this is the crazy thing new egg
has overpriced the 1080 TI to 828 20
which isn't that much of a markup
honestly there should be 700 to 800 I
mean usually the really highest end ones
all the other ones yes so these aren't
crazy marked up right now they're
definitely more expensive than they
should be but go back to all sellers and
then suddenly you have thousands eleven
hundred bucks so can actually I can
actually buy this so Tech one from any
world for $1100 no nope nope nope I
wouldn't do it let's see what I you see
the art picker has to say let's check
that out
you can go over here to individual parts
on PC part picker
let's check memory prices first of all
if I want to go and get me some ddr4
3000 some solid decently fast not entry
level but decently fast perfectly
adequate for a Rison build or or an
intel build I'd say $200 you're gonna
want a 16 gig kit I feel like that's
your you know eight gigs this more entry
level at this point right and then
that's about it right that's that's all
you really need
all right 170 dollars for that right now
that's for a team dark kit which doesn't
look terrible yeah it's just this
picture is table
all right hundred and seventy dollars
still still crazy expensive still double
what it was a year ago but anyway let's
let's go back to graphics cards take a
look take a look see here and I want to
check out the let's look at let's look
at an rx 580 I mean have you even
bothered to look in a 580 in so long
because I just assume it's all terrible
and it is $400 for these were $2 $50 is
what you should be spending they were
250 350 to 300 and that's some super
Bay's which is out of stock but may as
Newegg actually has this for $400 no
it's nothing what oh I can't why are you
putting us through this right now Paul
this is like I want to experience
whatever what else is experiencing gonna
try and shop for graphics capability now
it's in Clockwork Orange like you're
just forced to be like nightmare is a
living breathing I even bother going to
Eva's odd I was gonna go to Amazon take
checked recently it's all the same shit
I feel like Amazon is is even more of
like it it's because they have even they
haven't raised your sellers market at
least some new ID does definitely so
that's no better that's horrible like my
stomach's in knots that's like oh we're
gonna explore it here maybe we'll find a
reasonable deal and we'll be right with
all of our live viewers no there's no
hope all right we're taking we're taking
one more look at that gtx 1066 gig no no
cert by lois pryce all right so the EVGA
and 60s see presentation 670 blue like
honestly the same price as a 1070 should
be alright alright alright 20 bucks less
than what the MSR okay if a 1070 should
be even then and that's such there's and
there's such a huge gap from the dance
performance 170 oh like that's a yeah
Wow
okay okay I feel bad now
dude poor travel-time wuj did you have
to pour the salt in the wound PO we
already knew was bad and now we won't
get sleep at night cuz sometimes like
your reality check you like man
everything's so horrible right now maybe
it's not haven't actually looked at
stuff for me only you look oh fuck that
could forget everything prices dropped a
bit and there's been kind of dabble
again okay I'm sorry everyone I I really
wish we were in a better situation when
it comes to these prices and I hope but
how it gets fixed soon because it's not
selling because yeah okay there's not
much else to say I don't this to have
anything more to add to that alright
let's let's let's run down some donation
comments cuz thank you guys for donating
those of you who have and have been able
to starting off with Camden and row with
the five dollar donation it says pick
bit wits knows there's an interesting
solution pick a suggestion ticket as
your favorite nose of the evening so you
can just point and be like I pick you
hey I see heroes nose yeah I see your
nose
yep I'm gonna choose between them heroes
whimpering and about to leave so I'll go
with your nose thank you hey I picked
ball picked my nose nose you pick my
nose
wow what a horrible cuppa all right mv7
you're okay mister mister lenticular
Paul 50 USD might not be as big of a
baller as 200 USD but it's not the size
of the baller it's how the ball has been
used to part - thank you sir very
generous to completely that's completely
super generous of you thank you so much
a very true statement behind it and and
I hope you're independently wealthy if
you're not taking my back no seriously
seriously thank you that's all um
speaking of 200 USD imagine vegeto hey
now I feel bad if I'm mispronouncing
your name right Madge mentioned some
don't you like that you're like I want
to get every detail about this person
correct the 200 at briefing 200 freakin
dollar donation' yeah oh my god oh well
appreciate all your work man watching
you guys for a long time keep up the
good work as before take your wives out
to dinner on me we will well my wife got
home just a little bit ago I was under
the impression that she was gonna make
dinner but I don't see her making dinner
so maybe I will be taking her out
momentarily we we shall see
but thank you like so much for your
crazy high donation Turner bucks says
it's epic that's amazing it's awesome
you're the best
next up is Benedict T with the $5
donation hey Paul Cal I am looking to
buy a second 250 gig SSD WD has an
inexpensive one have you guys worked
with a WD SSD before if so thoughts I've
seen the reviews on their nvme ones the
WD black PCIe versions and then in
pretty positive yeah they're pretty good
and they're good like for a 206 gig and
get it for like 99 bucks well I know WD
had a like sort of a first attempt at
SSDs that came out I feel like and I
want to say in 2013 or something like
that and those were not horrible but
they were really overpriced at the time
I remember right for what you got so
yeah maybe you double-check make sure
that whatever you're getting a good deal
on right now isn't one of those the the
stuff they've done more more recently in
the past a couple of to three years has
been perfectly adequate just make sure
you're not getting one of those older
outdated models sometimes those can go
on sale and for people who still have
stock left over that kind of thing yeah
but yeah WD is a good company overall
and they have a really good army system
which I always appreciate I don't feel
like you have to mention they're cool
trainer Gavin with $5 donation I'm gonna
rise into a 1300 X with a gigabyte a be
350 gaming three board and two by eight
gigs
Ripjaws 2666 ram button bios that says
2133 program and crashes when every
started 2666 cool trainer Gavin you're
probably experiencing the classic Rison
ddr4 memory can
ability issues yeah depending on the
memory kit that you have you might have
you might have single rank you might
have dual rank Rison has a riser that's
a more difficult time with the dual rank
memory so I would definitely double
check your motherboards your ass rack
motherboards vendor list all the dogs
sorry but duck here here I'll stop
barking okay everything's fine
everything's right there just
double-check the vendor lists and they
just make sure if your Amazon they're
not if it's not on there you might just
have a rom kit that is functional 2066
probably if you plugged it into an Intel
system you'd be just fine but you might
have a harder time with Rison so it
might be something where you want to
consider selling the kit you have and
buying a new kit or something like that
you can also tray like inputting the
timings manually that's some of the PAS
seems like the BIOS as well as the
voltage and you know just making sure
that X and peas
you know selected or not XMP but making
sure that the rated frequency profile
within the BIOS is selected for the
speed that your kit is rated at that
inputting the voltage and the timings
manually it has generally helped me and
make sure that your BIOS is updated like
manufactures or specifically are
updating their BIOS all the time
primarily to improve memory
compatibility so I would definitely look
at all those different you could also
potentially loosen your timings so if
your memory is 2060 2666 with timings of
like 16 16 whatever you could
potentially lose some 720 6666 but then
loosen the timings up to 18 18 whatever
sure just try doing that and for a
functional setup okay J
Bell Bell right yeah oh this is a
similar question also five dollar
donation as rock a be 350 M pro four to
four gig sticks of course their
vengeance lpx at 3,000 rising 2200 G 256
gig at WD black m2 nvme EVGA bqa plus
bronze 500 watt thoughts that's nice
matter your yeah I mean your and you're
priming for if you want to upgrade later
down the line and pop indiscreet in
there you'd be solid like you have
decent RAM you have a good power supply
to house a discreet card and a very good
foundation with that you know be 350 mm
and many more in particular if memory if
you're running that memory solidly at 29
33 which is what the divider you should
be able to hit with 3000 speedram you're
good to go the thing you'll probably
want to upgrade the sooner rather well
depending on prices of course because
memory prices suck but you'll probably
hit a wall with your 8 gigs of memory
earlier than maybe otherwise then maybe
your limitations with a graphics card so
at some point you might want to want to
jump from 8 gigs up to a 16 gig kit and
at that point I would say sell your to
four gigs sticks and by 288 big sticks
and it's an upgrade that way right but
nice nice setup there Jake and Josh
we're with the five Canadian dollar
donation hey guys what would be a good
CPU for a HTPC or nest via
virtualization but they want to have a
1070 or 1080 and a limit of a 650 watt
SFX power supply you don't need much
yeah you don't need too much for an HTTP
C&amp;amp;S I would say go with a quad core
because quad cores are just a lot more
accessible right now and especially if
you're considering virtualization having
more cores it's often very helpful for
that so yeah I would consider some of
the rise and quad core options that are
out there there's some rising threes and
I remove one of the low and rising fives
be a possibility for you if you have a
1070 or 1080 in there it seems like
maybe gaming on your HP PC as a
possibility in the living room if that's
the case I would definitely suggest a
rise in 5 CPU I would stray away from
the rising
then you go with like a risin 5 1600 or
something like that VA 3 MHP with the
$10 Canadian have you ever tried any
Canadian beers
if not I recommend Molson Canadian lager
Molson moldable so nice is I'm sure I've
trade Molson this Moosehead Molson
Canadian is it took Canadians yeah oh my
Canadian someone said I used to drink a
lot of moose head back in the dead moose
who said the right eyed neck right next
to me oh I sold a loose head for very
cheap
I feel like Molson Molson to Canada
wouldn't Wilson to Canada be like what
Budweiser is to the United States is yes
extended like is the biggest it's a big
mainstream American serum which often is
like I'll say this about Budweiser a lot
like Budweiser should get credit freebie
being able to consistently in large
batches brew their beer right the level
of flavor that they're able to do it I
mean there's something to be said that
so anyway yes I've definitely had Molson
but I feel like I generally like I don't
know I like the uniqueness of some of
the smaller breweries and some of the
just different twists that they have to
do sometimes take risks with flavors
that some of the big bird
I'm sure America's like rubbed off for
like the US has rubbed off on Canadian
some aspects with like craft brewing I
bet there's a lot of good Canadian craft
thread that I've never explored I'm sure
there is I'm gonna use the restroom no
no no you're not you're not alone okay
go ahead cap I release you Shannon Scott
with the $5 Australian
why are most youtubers calling the new
potential Nvidia cards 2080
not 1180 or 1280
if ampere is after Volta has Nvidia
released the official name Nvidia has
not released the official name
everything that's been discussed has
been rumor and speculation if I had the
same my thought process there
it's that whenever you're in marketing
person for a company like Nvidia the
bigger number is always what you want to
go with so if you
pardon me if you're counting up like
looking at videos GTX series for the
past ten years you know they had a 400
series 500 series a 600 series the 700
series they didn't really do much with
the 800 series but the 900 series and
then they had the 10 hundred series so
yeah 1100 series would probably make
more sense 1180
1170 1160 1180 TI that's not possible
but I don't know something tells me that
mm sounds like a lot more than 1100 so
maybe they'll go with 2,000 but honestly
yeah you're right it's all speculation
at this point
Nvidia could completely scrap it they're
naming scheme and start over with like a
100 series or something like that which
honestly I'd be totally fine with
because I don't know naming conventions
for graphics cards and product lines
tend to keep repetitive over time so
change is sometimes good unless you're
Intel and AMD then it's confusing okay
Thank You Shannon though for your
donation Matt a with $10 donation says
you guys Rock but I'm the only one here
so he must mean just I rock so I take
all of Kyle's praises well thank you
Matt for that and for your donation Joel
Malin Ickx with the $5 donation Cheers
bros I'm going to be drinking my beer
from one of Paul's glasses when it
arrives and then I'll order order Kyle's
glass any beer recommendations I can
definitely say you're making the right
choice by drinking out of my glass I
can't say anything about Kyle's glass
because I've not tried any of his
glasses yet because still doesn't have
any I'm not sure why I feel like it's up
to Kyle to ask to have some of those
sent over Tim but yeah thank you for
your support and for drinking out of my
glasses these are these are really nice
glasses and I like them s from beer
recommendations this is really good
double nut round
I like I like it a lot okay Stephen Hill
what's the $20 donation oh my god Thank
You Steven that what the hell did I just
do I just clicked on things completely
wrong I hope you all are well of
listening editing some videos from bear
this weekend oh gotta enjoy the little
snow we have no casualties hope the
recovery as well I was in Big Bear last
weekend that's when I was snowboarding
and got my rib and arm injury oh yeah
hey Big Bear now Big Bear sucks totally
ugly ugly town don't you ever visit and
that's really there's really not much
snow right now no there's no at least
it's cold at least it's cold all of a
sudden yeah it's like hey I almost
forgot about that whole winter thing hey
here's some freezing but you know it's
not it's not even really freezing the
unlivable snow it's a low of 38 per week
or week Californians which is like we're
like oh my god it's not the lowest below
40 the rest of the world's like warm at
shutdown shut everything down East Coast
is like they out of swimming yeah listen
to the beach boys suck it grab the
planes and everyone huddle in the bunker
the leaves and the trees are like moving
you're blowing and stuff yeah there's
lots of wind okay ever waters five
dollars don't make the mistake I did by
using consumer hardware for your server
AMD epic would be a great fit check
comments on your latest boat plain vid
hey there you go okay you're busy Eric I
am hey yep
yeah you should use server and hardware
for a server I I don't know I heard very
conflicting things when I was
researching it I heard from the for the
purposes that I'm using a for that
mainstream consumer grade stuff would be
okay and that I'm not gonna be using it
24/7
as long as you are gonna be very cc so
it's not gonna be on all the time no all
right then that's a different situation
yeah more on that with geared Inc $10
donation hey guys thanks for all you do
went from two hundred to five thousand
subs after just a month only possible
because you challenged me every day to
be better
Oh glad to have you back have a drink on
me guys that's your name thank you
cheers man 200 to 5,000 in a month
better than I drew and you have just
challenged me to be better so it's it's
reciprocal it's reciprocal it's a
feedback loop all right thank you very
much geared Inc we appreciate and
congrats again
Jeremiah wait five dollars and 67 cents
very specific thanks for the great show
guys you're welcome Jeremiah you're the
man thanks for the donation Oh gun
omneya we're gonna meet we're gonna man
seven dollars and eighty no 7.89 New
Zealand Dollars she was there called
Kiwis Kiwis gave me Zane from New
Zealand a double Johnson by accident so
what tile store first race pop oh well
cool well thank you st. appreciate thank
you for following me up with a double
Chandra the most honest man I know
that's the first accidental double
Johnson we've come around you kept us
honest we have now we've now never had
an erroneous double Johnson pet store I
want to make that claim right now never
proven DJ fried bread the third $10 rise
in five 1600 or rise in seven seventeen
hundred to replace my FX 8520 if you can
swing it than the 1,700 yeah extra cores
next breads yep or you know go over the
1600 and you can always upgrade later or
if you can wait two months which I read
the rise and two options yep that that
is soon get a 2600 that we were just
talking about yeah perhaps 15% at
success multi-core uplift high along
though with the $5 donation pimp my PC
should be a 10-minute weekly video for
floatplane exclusives just my thoughts
PS imagine vegeto is a Dragonball Z
reference I but so you should know that
but I only watch certain saga it's like
I didn't watch that entire Vegeta
but that's majeeda this is vegeto the G
no totally different okay Lou the Dragon
Ball universe is very it has lots of
depth and
goes on better smiles obviously look the
lore is he's ageless it's thick that's
good to know it and thank you Highland
for that all right badger zero five
dollars no comments
thank you sir for your donation thank
you Chris head brawn every five dollars
high pollen count a fan admired the good
work you do do you have any suggestions
for low profile
IOT's example of Corsair Hydra series
h5s F cooler so that's the one that they
use for the bulldog small form-factor
yeah yeah so you're looking for a small
form-factor liquid cooler for your CPU
um geez I mean that one's tricky the the
Corsair Hydra one that you're talking
about the h5s F that's specifically for
very use case scenarios inside of the
Bulldog for example it doesn't work with
all cases so I don't know are there any
low profile AIO that are small
form-factor compared to the rest I mean
smalls I can think of as a big 120 I
guess him I mean what are we talking
about when it comes to low profile the
the the block pump units that goes that
mounts to the CPU I think look he means
a low profile like the radiator is
really profile to which it's like for a
small form-factor build maybe like but
as far as usually those are just like
the low end ones like the entry-level
that have like kind of the thinner like
18 millimeter radiators yeah yeah
Coolermaster I know they're entry-level
I feel like I have one of them over they
have one of their entry-level master
cooler liquid coolers if those are
pretty small you know they got a basic
pump in there and everything right so
that might be an option for you you can
use some slim hands to on like a
standard a IO to get the overall
thickness down but yeah there really
aren't that many options to be honest
for what you're looking for
you got your typical 120 s your two 40s
three sixties they can colormaster also
do that like all in one unit that's like
the AI oh and the pump and then the fan
and the radiator is like attached to it
oh they did right but I definitely
remember it got very mixed reviews yes
that one's very good in concept very
much yeah
so I don't look into it though I might
suit your needs who knows angel - okay
go ahead
HL - master five dollars double
nut-brown exactly that's all you need to
know Cheers
Andrew look ooh sick boo kusik $5 hey
guys what do you think of using horizon
320 200 for an office PC would be mainly
used for day-to-day stuff along the
occasional SketchUp Pro use I think it'd
be a fantastic option for that I mean no
need to get a discrete GPU good for
those use key for that use case honestly
it might even be a little overkill
depending on yeah you can go for it an
i3 with integrated coz yeah until HD
graphics like would be maybe even
cheaper because cuz honestly you're not
you're you're not using that Vega GPU
much at all Skype is is not going to be
the tasking a3 that the 3d yeah so um
but yeah it's definitely perfectly
viable
yeah and it's quad core so right there
you go mmm

for you Thomas finally we're gonna end
this
half of the show we're gonna end off
some hardware today by sending you all
over for a rate watching live oh yeah
then Oh according to our friend and
moderator hotter yourself big thanks
also to sell it that's okay give himself
a shout out today so you're always
awesome as usual he said hey everyone
should go over now and check out Casey
Britt Casey Britt's letter K the letter
C and then Britt CRI T's twitch.tv slash
k CB RIT and tell Casey that he's being
raided by awesome hardware and he
currently has six viewers she's take off
all his clothes currently have six
viewers we have six hundred and thirty
five at the moment so he should get
naked so yeah make sure that he does
Scalia awful terrible basically what
we're demanding blows money in and just

first half it's linked in the
description and all of the links to the
stories have talked about today they're
also linked in the description be sure
so thanks to you guys for being here
and we'll be back next week with more
awesome hardware hey thanks for dinner
oh yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
