I'm coming to you for the first time in
2013 and wow it's been a long year 2012
started up my new channel and I just got
back from CES 2013 in Las Vegas Nevada
so I wanted to sort of give a quick
recap really quick while it's still kind
of fresh in my mind and also share a few
more things with you guys since it has
been a few weeks at least probably like
three since i posted my last video and i
want to give you guys sort of at least a
quick idea of what i'm going to be doing
in 2013 and no i also wanted to say hi
hi puppy you know good let's start off
though with my thoughts on CES 2013 um
it was a whirlwind this type of thing
you know is coming it's coming for a
while you planned for it and then it
happens and then it's just over so
quickly um so we spent total of five
days there four nights came in on Monday
drove back out on Friday we actually
spent two days on the CES floor as well
as with the certain vendors that we
wouldn't visited and then the third day
which was Thursday we actually spent
most of the time preparing for our
eggies awards which we should have a
video up on newegg TV if one is not up
there already the things that kind of
stuck out to me as far as the show went
I really liked the stuff the asus and
AMD we're showing me actually i had a
good time at both of their locations
issues for example for example I might
have seen the video with me and JJ he
was showing off ares to 7970 x2 in two
gpus insane video card gigahertz edition
GPUs really fast card i'm really hoping
i get a chance to play around with it
and JJ totally misled me that's why i
said he lied to me in the video but he
misled me because i asked him about it
as I Creed in the areas to like months
ago and he's like oh no we're not but
they did and they came out with it and
it's pretty sweet also he showed me PCI
Express gen3 on a diva share a cpu which
also i was just like what and actually i
went over to the AMD like bunker they
had the next day and I was like did you
guys know that I soo set up gen 3 on
Bashar and they're like what No so like
they didn't even know at least the rep I
talk to you right there at the time
wasn't aware of it
asus with whatever work they had to do
to enable that I'm Bashara their new 98
990fx board has that built in so I
thought that was pretty cool and then at
the actual AMD a bunker we had the
surround house experience which is like
you go into this cabin they have like I
think nine or ten actually I think it's
like one two three four five six seven
eight nine ten i think it's eleven
monitors set up on each wall of this
little cabin you're in and it's like the
simulated experience with these cops
coming up the cabin and hostages being
held and it shows not only the power of
the gpus with like that night 1920 by
like 10,000 plus display with all the
displays a I'm going on that's also 360
and they also work in the positional
sounds so the sound when they turned on
comes from the actual location where
it's emanating from in the simulation
really cool experience so like I said in
the video if you guys get a chance to
check out the ground house definitely do
a few more things I met a few people
there i met Gordon my own for a maximum
pc he's always been a favorite pc
reviewer of mine i just i love his his
candor he's just right out there with
everything he says about everything so I
met him actually that was for the second
time I met him a few years back when he
was at newegg but I had a nice
conversation with him also of course I
met Linus a couple different times got a
picture with him I also met slick and
that one was kind of random I was
walking through the razor booth and I
looked and I saw an fs700 camera unless
I go that's really nice camera and then
I looked again I was like oh that's
slick and then that there's this guy
next to him who is like I was that
detailed I was diesel so that's like
really quick a super nice guy like you
can just one of those people who can
tell me to him like he's just really
nice really friendly there's really
complimentary of our stuff which is
awesome coming from those guys because I
don't know if you saw the linus tech
tips coverage of CES but they like
destroyed it they did so many videos and
i have no idea how they're still alive
right now 2013 coming up for my channel
lease personally because like i said in
my first video i really just wanted to
start it early but i'm not really going
to start posting videos in earnest until
this year so i guess now so i guess for
that I'm going to be trying to do a
little bit more
content that's got a bit more opinion
based stuff in it so I'm going to try to
get more of my opinions some types of
things that we don't typically do on
newegg TV which I would like to showcase
here I want to do more direct comparison
so if I'm showing an AMD video card I'd
like to compare it to the direct not via
competition for that video card give you
guys a bit more benchmark stuff and that
sort of thing set up some test beds and
that sort of thing over here that type
of content which I hope you guys want to
see and are looking forward to and
that's all I'm getting rid of my notes
now so I hid all my points I am NOT
gonna take a little bit of a break I'm
gonna play some video games because I
haven't got to do that for like a week
and i guess i should i should also walk
the dog anyway that's all for this video
guys I really appreciate all of you guys
watching hope you've enjoyed it if you
want to see all the CES 2013 coverage we
did with newegg you can it's on the
newegg TV channel of course don't forget
to subscribe to my channel if you want
to see more videos like this as well as
stuff well as well as the stuff i'm
planning to bring in 2013 and i'll see
you next time on pulse hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
