momaday - prayer to me whenever I'm
starting the live show I always imagined
that for a few people it's the first
time they've ever seen or experienced
anything like that so that always makes
me very kind of scared a little scared
oh it's all right though okay yeah I
think where it looks like rely ever
streaming and everything's good so hello
everyone and welcome this is awesome
hardware it's a live show we stream it
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware which is our shared twitch
channel and we also stream it to our
YouTube channels so the first half of
today's show which is episode number 136
we've already streamed to Kyle's channel
bit wit it's linked in the video
description so if you didn't watch that
you can go ahead and check it out we've
been drinking a few beers and we've been
talking about technology and we're gonna
continue doing that for another hour or
so now on my half of the show here on
pulse hardware whoo it's gonna be great
a quick word of warning to any of you
guys who are have young children or that
kind of thing we occasionally use adults
language here on the show we speak
freely and openly and of course there's
some some beverages and vibed and
whatnot
we encourage you to do so as well if you
are doing so responsibly of course
and/or your age and all that kind of
things all right I think I think we're
doing okay so far I'm gonna do a quick
plug here as we usually do for our
stores if you want to help support us
and get yourself some cool merchandise
very high-quality stuff check out Paul's
hardware net you can buy stuff from my
store there if you buy stuff during the
show will shout Johnson and your name at
you at the end of the show it's a
fascinating ritual which I don't
completely understand myself but yeah we
keep doing we do it any whatever the
less
excuse me tiles store is bit wit tech
slash store he also has high quality
goods all comes from the same location
and it's all it's all good stuff so if
you buy stuff thank you for helping to
support us yeah and everything yeah all
right buy stuff now do it I quickly need
to address something and buy quickly I
mean like super quickly because I don't
want to talk about this too much ok but
I haven't really posted any videos this
week and if you follow me on Twitter I
tweeted a couple things or earlier this
week about I'm having kind of a rough
time and I promise to share a little bit
more today on the live show I'm not
gonna go into any crazy details or
anything at this because this is pretty
personal and everything ends as already
mentioned we've been doing some drinking
and whatnot so I don't want to say
anything anyway um understandable
alright so I am married and my wife and
I as married people often do have been
trying to have a kid and actually we
were successful in in in the creation of
a of a kid several months back and we
had just gotten to the point where we
were starting to share with people when
at the beginning of January we got some
really bad news unfortunately our child
had a condition which was terminal and
it's not survivable so as of this past
week when we're no longer pregnant and
the little girl we were expecting to
arrive and the summer is no longer gonna
be arriving so um we've been really
really sad and it's been very
challenging and probably some of the
most difficult things just to deal with
that I've ever gone through so
so I've I haven't haven't that much
content production and I don't think
anyone would blame you at this point and
my wife and I have done a lot of crying
and everything but we fortunately we
have a really good group of friends and
family who can really support it forest
and so that's been really cool and very
helpful but I just wanted to I guess
tell you guys if if I haven't been
myself or if I haven't been doing stuff
the way I usually do that's that's the
reason behind it so anyway oh I messed
that you're like here doing this show
right well I like you you guys have
shown some tremendous strength
well padding's can say see the scene
happening and disease CES was rough to
get there and everything but yeah so
yeah thanks to all you guys who have
been tweeting us like I said earlier
this week when I tweeted I'm pretty
pretty vaguely and stuff there's just so
many people who said so many wonderful
positive things for us so thank you guys
for all of that yeah anyway alright now
that I've said that let's let's move
over to the show proper and I'll talk
about some tech news and anything so
let's start off second half as we
usually do with tech news tech news yay
for tech news as good as we do you know
there's not a whole lot of it going on
actually right now I mean most of the
tech news right now is hey graphics
cards are really expensive and memory is
really expensive and it sucks but read
who makes cameras has been rebuilding a
smartphone and we've kind of talked
about a little bit here on the show so
so far but earlier this week they came
out with a bunch more news about - the
hydrogen one which is their smartphone
which also has a holographic display
and actually they opened up pre-orders
for this last year right back when we
first talked about it in July so people
have been pre-ordering this for $1,200
since July and I don't know how many
peers they have going on or whatever but
more details now nice it's got a
snapdragon 835 X SOC and a
system-on-chip processor they were I
read a couple things that said it might
be a customized one but nothing very
clear about that
it's kind of dual sim configuration
which i think is kind of cool you can
either have two SIM cards so two phone
numbers or do different carriers that
kind of thing or one of them's I don't
know if one or both of them is a hybrid
slot so you could have one a SIM card
and one is a micro SD card so cool
microSD expansion which is always super
super nice it's not like a proprietary
read micro SD card the cost $9 and out
as far as I know okay the read I know
the read storage devices for their
cameras can be very expensive so I hope
that's I wouldn't expect them I don't
think they can call it micro sd and have
proprietary let's truth going on in
there but hopefully that's not the case
yeah 4500 milliamp hour battery
listening yeah should hopefully have
really good battery life the weight is
listed as 2 ounces heavier than a
typical 5.7 inch device which is sort of
vague and nonspecific but what's a
typical 5.7 inch device large enough of
the large you know iPhone plug the big
screen cell phones basically ok it's
you're gonna expect it to be a little
bit heavier than that and that's because
it's supposed to be more sturdy is this
and this is also a 5.7 inch device yes
it is a 5.7 inch screen so got it that
would that would fall in line with that
okay it does have a headphone jack props
for that I don't know how much longer
we're gonna be able to tell people hey
good they put a headphone jack yeah
multi-channel spatial surround through
stereo speakers are headphones
the display is a 1440p resolution and
holographic 4 v so what they're calling
the actual display name mean a
holographic 20 and 4 V it means that
when you look at this
from above it can do simulated
three-dimensional hologram I haven't
seen it myself so it's hard for me to
say specifically how what it looks like
or if it's useful at all or anything
like that but you can supposedly use the
camera to shoot for V contents front and
rear without an add-on module or
anything like that
via just via the built-in front and rear
cameras there's talking about
unprecedented carrier support so that
hopefully means that they have already
worked out deals with multiple carriers
to be able to get it with you know with
the two-year with a contract plan or
something like that that's not a very
useful way to get a really nice phone
for not having to pay a big up for a
cost if you're planning on sticking with
your carrier here for a couple of years
anyway probably gonna have demos of the
phone and April and launch is coming
sometime in the summer so again nice
Pacific but summer launch but probably
in April we'll see at least mkbhd yeah
I'm sure Austin Evans and John TLT those
guys will be content on those we'll see
more of the hydrogen one I have not
pre-ordered a 200 I'm still super happy
with my pixel tube I don't get enough
views on myself on any cell phone videos
I've ever done so weren't pre-ordering
something like that that's true o us in
the in the PC in the PC DIY space yeah
for the man out when it comes to mobile
next up Amazon go is now a thing it has
debuted up in Seattle at least okay Ars
Technica Ars Technica has an article on
it we talked about this before
Amazon goes basically the idea of a
store a brick-and-mortar store that you
physically go into with Amazon app on
your phone and you walk in you're
recognized via the app you buy take
whatever stuff you want then you walk
out and it's it knows what you took in
it bills you to a preset up card that
you have attached
your account - that kind of thing sure
know the premise of the story is all
those all based around cameras watching
you all the time I actually saw this
store in Seattle I saw a tweet of it
with a big old line out front but
hopefully that was short-lived because
it seems not to might not make much
sense to have a big line in front of a
store that's entirely based around not
waiting in line for anything but there
it is up in Seattle it's got a crazy
camera system going on an overhead with
hundreds of cameras they watch you know
this is the system that that where you
walk in through and basically scans you
or it scans your app these you no longer
need a prime account for this store all
you have to have is to Amazon Go app so
a smartphone basically with with the app
on it and there's a turnstile that reads
a barcode from the app when you walk in
and then the cameras track you the whole
time and watch what you do and see what
what products you take and put into your
bags little orange bags provided by
Amazon to walk around with and do your
shopping and I know well all these
pictures look like they were taken very
hastily yeah this is the view looking up
though and here's where you can see all
the different arrays of sensors and
cameras and everything like that which
is the thing that seems like both the
unique and innovative thing about the
store but also the thing where you're
like and really get screwed up like all
of this technology is making this store
somehow more profitable than a store
that just has people who yeah check you
out and make sure that you buy stuff for
whatever I mean over time I would I
guess yeah if it's functional and you
know and it doesn't need time shooting
done every hour on the hour yeah they do
sell beer wine and liquor there is a
physical person I guess back in jaeyun
in that area of the store that will
check your ID and whatever and the
author of this article Sam much much
Quebec Sam match Quebec tried his very
best to trick the system to fool it to
steal basically from Elsa he almost got
away with some yogurt
okay how did he that was mainly because
he figured out that if you need to
return something
you basically just tell the app I don't
like this thing and it's like alright
okay yeah cuz you don't really need to
return it it just I think it just
refunds you or whatever oh so who knows
if that type of thing will be taking
advantage of but he tried like do you
tried to trick it by like picking up a
thing and looking at the label and
putting it back or picking up multiple
things and swapping them around in his
hands and all that kind of thing wasn't
able to fool their system though
according to what he said hmm probably
largely due to the fact that everything
is sort of positioned at its own little
aisle with its width separated
separation between things so it knows
what you've taken and what you're
putting back and everything like that
but look even batteries and feminine
hygiene products goods good times
someone's gonna have in a way to keep
this yeah someone will but yeah all the
time people just you pick up the stuff
you want walk out and then in about 15
minutes you get an email with your
receipts and it will charge whatever
payments method you have attached to
your Amazon account no the Amazon Go app
so you don't have to actually scan any
any items that you check out with no in
your bag and walk away just pick things
up and walk out because when you when
you first go in the store and scan
yourself in it starts tracking you as an
entity right and whatever you take its
associates with you as a your entity and
that it's your you as an entity is
associated with that account and it
knows what usually can solely based on
the cameras that are above for you yeah
cameras and sensors and I don't know
like I don't know everything as far as
what they have a raid like I don't know
if those sensors in the actual food
dispenser parts of it or if it's all
just cameras and everything going on
overhead I wonder if it base I needs you
somehow from what I have from from the
way the article describes it no it
doesn't all it has to do is figure out
the ear person and then
it can do enough tracking of people
moving around the store to figure out
who you are and that you're the same
person as you're moving from place to
place right and then it's just a matter
of tracking the products that you pick
up hmm I wonder if the all those
products aren't a sensor of some sort
like even like you know a bottle of
Tabasco is on like some little sensors
that it no I feel like they keep it in a
basket if you get a hotel they can they
can have like a little button
yeah it detects if you pick up a bag of
mms or whatever right that I feel like
yeah that's right amazon should have
access to that technology as well yeah
I'm just wondering if that's what
they're using or if they're using
something more like sophisticated I'm
not sure I feel like there's probably
stuff that they don't want to tell
people because obviously that's a way to
cheat people would try to take advantage
of it yeah when they know it's a lot of
misses fascinating though ya know what
it is about autonomous systems though
it's like oh that system is autonomous I
want to try to cheat and scam it as much
as I possibly can right versus a person
it's like can you imagine having that
mentality with a person like oh there's
a person standing there trying to
prevent stop dealing let's see
everything I can do and steal from them
machines when actual people yeah but
that may soon change but there's a
definite the robots can be a
mentor-protege yes stun gun you to death
yeah then maybe the tables will turn but
hey if you want to steal from Amazon
then maybe you'll feel more justified at
least if you pay their monthly Prime
membership because they've just checked
up the price $2 yeah yes
11 to 13 the monthly Prime membership is
going from 1099 a months to $12.99 a
month percent increase while rates might
only seem like $2 to you but crazy
different when you consider it to be an
18% increase Wow or an extra 24 dollars
per year although it wouldn't make much
sense to suddenly pay $24 it was at $13
times 12
what is that it's a number 144 plus both
so hundred an fifty $656 sure why would
you pay a hundred and fifty six dollars
a year when you could pay ninety nine
dollars a year for the standard yearly
Amazon Prime membership which has not
changed it's still ninety nine dollars a
year for that hmm
really what this is all about is
apparently there's a subset of people
who sign up for Amazon Prime like maybe
a couple times a year
like signed up for it for a month for
1099 and order like all the stuff that
you're gonna order for that third of the
year or have it here or whatever get
free shipping on it on slip then cancel
it and then Amazon has paid $11 for you
know 20 30 40 $100 worth of shipping or
whatever so obviously those money so
right this is them looking at their
business model and saying all right we
can increase this price a bit it's gonna
affect this smaller subset of people who
a smaller subset of them is taking
advantage of this yeah and their way to
fire back a little bit mitigate them
their ability to take advantage of it
and make up some of the money in the
meantime
yeah so yeah for most people who pay
yearly proceed proceed continue paying
zero before yeah yeah it's best way to
go all right moving on moving on YouTube
has changed their rules they're changing
up the rules and this is a bit of a
response to the ad pocalypse thing that
was going on but they're basically
they're tightening up the rules when it
comes to smaller channels and when it
comes to people who want to be involved
with the YouTube Partner Program YouTube
Partner Program is what allows you to
monetize your videos to have YouTube
feed ads at the beginning so that you
can make money off of the content that
you produce and YouTube calls these
changes tough but necessary this is
YouTube sort of thanks Logan Paul yeah
this is this is no Logan Falls because
YouTube's attempting to navigate the
waters between what they have been in
the past
ten years developing themselves as the
premier online upload and streaming
video content platform to what they want
to be which is a very profitable video
streaming platform online and in order
to be profitable with their business
bottle you need to have advertisers and
in order to have the really good
advertisers who pay lots of money you
need to make sure that their advertising
on content that is advertiser friendly
so enter the YouTube ad pocalypse and
them flagging a lot of channels as you
know we're not sure if you're legit if
your content is controversial on that so
you have limited ads this is all them
attempting to create processes that are
autonomous enough that they can have
minimal human interaction and still
somehow moderate the vast amount of
content that is uploaded to YouTube
every second of every single day which
some of which they want to monetize and
feed ads in front of which is a good
idea for them to be able to make money
yeah now all that said previously you
needed 10,000 total views that's that
was what you needed in order to get into
the YouTube Partner Program which maybe
is a lot maybe he's a little depending
on whether or not you've had a video
that took off now you need to also have
1,000 subscribers and 4,000 hours of you
time over the past year so again this is
either a very challenging thing to
achieve or something that happened
fairly quickly depending on whether or
not yet because you can have a video a
single video that gets enough views that
it starts to get us into the suggested
feed that hits these requirements in a
day mm-hmm whereas you can have other
people who upload videos consistently
every week or maybe a couple times a
week but you know they just don't have
that video that takes off mm-hmm or they
don't have
I don't know what it exactly with that
certain de jeunesse a quoi that's the
video needs in order to get the views
and everything like that so yeah the
rules currently are gonna apply it to
people who are trying to get in but
they're also going to start applying
these rules to current partners On
February 20th so I mean no matter the
size of those partners right exactly so
even if you join the YouTube Partner
prep platform four or five years ago
based on your content upload and number
of views and everything at the time if
you are not currently and still getting
enough views that being 10,000 total
views thousand subscribers 4000 hours of
view time over the past year then you
might be removed from the partner
program as well and I've definitely seen
some tweets from some people who this
affects in a pretty crappy way that
being people who create content that's
maybe informational but in a more niche
type of area mm-hmm
and that kept type of thing very helpful
but not necessarily something that lots
of people are gonna be viewing right I
know that's kind of vague but pup
shepherd one of our longtime viewers
were saying that his channel is getting
shut down yeah cuz he only meets that he
doesn't meet the 4,000 watch time hours
annual in order to to keep his channel
sustained he only makes you know it gets
about 2,500 hours which isn't too far
off you know and he has 600 or so
subscribers but YouTube's completely
just canning his channel because he
doesn't meet these new very new
requirements yeah but I remember before
like you could you could have posted two
videos with like 100 views each and like
you to be give you the option to
monetize them YouTube is all about it
yeah anyone anyone literally anyone can
monetize their videos and now there's
they're trying to please the advertisers
advertisers are getting pissed how could
you give this guy who has 5 subscribers
who's you know spewing racial slurs or
whatever any any of our airtime and so
you know what one a few bad apples ruins
it
a bunch bunch of terrible terrible
creators who are making shit content
that is not advertising friendly are not
respectful for the Terms of Service
really basically are ruining it for the
rest of us that's just how it is
and it sucks because there are a lot of
channels out there who are trying their
hardest trying their best who are trying
to meet these numbers in a really legal
and fine way that just you know maybe
they need that extra year so to to
really break these numbers but they're
getting cut off now because um you know
it's tough but necessary now according
to what I've read there probably isn't
much of a chance that somebody who
there's probably nobody who is
completely reliant upon YouTube for all
of their income who's suddenly getting
that cut off because the cut off that
they're making this out right now the
level of viewership and everything is
roughly equivalent to about a hundred
dollars a year when it comes to revenue
from YouTube so what this is doing is
it's making it more challenging for
people who have who or just getting
started to get started more quickly
mm-hmm because you got a kind of clark
way in to the partner program and get
yourself a following and everything and
it's more challenging to do that of
course if you're not making money any
money off of it and it's very difficult
for smaller or more niche channels who
may be posting frequently or whatever
but who enjoy the bit of extra income
that comes along with that you know a
little bit of a kickback for the time
and effort that you put into creating
content on YouTube is very nice to have
and might help people get more equipment
or anything like that yeah so definitely
is challenging for some people if you're
like looking at this from Google's
perspective they're looking at a
situation where they have a absolutely
insane amount of video content uploaded
to their platform every single second of
every single day they are attempting to
parse this to take the bulk of its that
is not monetizable
and separate that from the content that
is monetizable yeah
to make the monetizable contents a
prettier package to be able to salt sell
to advertisers you have to pay more
money like but I want to make sure that
their content is only being placed on
videos that they find appropriate right
so it's a balancing act and this is a
decision that they've made for now we'll
keep an eye on it and you know maybe
maybe bring you guys some more feedback
in a few weeks if we've heard from
anyone who's been severely affected by
this for now excuse me what I'm hoping
this does is take some channels that we
watch that we know yet that we know are
well over this threshold I'm gonna point
out like hardware in box for example
mm-hmm who have been struggling with
limited YouTube ad my limited
advertisements on a lot of their videos
yeah might now have more resources
devoted to them to clearing their videos
because there's a lot less video
submitted to the manual approval process
right so maybe that is a positive upshot
from this yeah hopefully that's true
YouTube might just be sort of investing
in the partners who are a little bit
more established instead of watering it
down because they're trying to cater to
literally everyone who is uploading a
home video yeah so there's also
apparently a something called Google
preferred videos which is something that
we need to get more of ourselves if your
video is good enough to be a Google
preferred video which I assume means it
hits certain threshold of views or
probably heats when it comes to views
per viewer engagement yeah how are that
kind of thing or if you just have a
channel that consistently gets lots of
views on all your videos that kind of
thing in writing the algorithm that's
probably not yours goes in the Google
preferred video program these videos are
manually curated and the ads running on
these videos are only running on videos
that have been verified to meet our ad
friendly guidelines so this is like
Google's premium program for like
content
they're gonna curate themselves they're
gonna watch and make sure that there's
no Logan Paul dead body is there
anything like that in them yeah and as a
result they're gonna be able to sell
these to advertisers and say like look
you're gonna pay more for this
advertising package but you're gonna get
you know all these views on these really
good videos really good this is a solid
real primetime content this is the real
deal content which is good for the
creator's in a sense because if you can
get on to Google preferred you'll
probably be making more purview
oh yeah Adams a day that's detective
Austin here
I bet Austin gets in the Google
preferred oh yeah I'm sure all those
guys too anyway I'm not jealous
oops just a name bullshit club also
though and actually one of the things
that that was one of the more useful
ideas is they're introducing a new
three-tier suitabilities system so ours
right now I guess you kind of have three
tiers because you have no monetization
limited ads or you're good now they're
having a three tier suitability system
which probably means like you're good
you're good for everything you're like
maybe you're okay feels like a pg-13
rating or something like that right
right like maybe here maybe in here
you're not quite as family-friendly but
hey it's kind of risque so I bet these
videos are getting lots of views right
right that kind of thing versus like the
full-on like no this is the room dead
bodies and pornography and yeah no but
you want advertise on that at all future
that seems a little bit more sensible to
me as well right okay I'd probably be in
the pg-13 area yeah I mean and that's
fine and this show would probably be in
the catch what they need because there's
cuz as advertisers who like I don't care
about the kids I'm I don't I'm not you
know our target audience yeah our
product I just buy another source of
views and I get the money to spend so
yeah so there we go so that that seems a
little bit more sensible tonight okay
let's talk about some actual hardware
although it's very brief and very not
normally it's
that's a microSD card yeah look at that
512 gig 512 gig Materazzi her damn why
significant we're in that it is a
record-breaking full half terabyte of
storage hm
in this tiny little micro SD card slot
molise as your pinky nail this is
usurping the previous record-holder for
capacity in a micro SD card which was
held by SanDisk's Knapp crappy and
terrible 400 gig micro SD obviously 512
gigs way back SanDisk's did hit 100
megabytes per second read though this
one does 80 megabytes per second reads
I'm not quite as fast it's classified as
an SDXC UHS - I you one card which means
it has a minimum write speed of 10
megabytes per second which is my most
disappointing factor of this yeah 10
megabytes per second is not that great
4k is gonna be mostly okay with 10
megabytes per second but not a how 2%
okay depending on the format that you're
rating it to a mother it's lossless or
how much loss eNOS is going on with it
as well as the bitrate and that kind of
thing should be able to handle full HD
off of most video cameras but would be
more exciting if it's 512 gigas well is
just a bit faster of a write speed to
make sure that when you're dealing
what's really really do we know what the
right speed is of the SanDisk no I don't
know not positive I didn't put that in
my own team I'd be interested to see
what that is
but if it's a u1 card then that's
minimum ten megabytes per second mm
that's just in order to meet the
standard yeah this doesn't meet the v10
standard for video transfer rates
designed to capture Full HD video office
cameras no price
unfortunately I'm guessing $400 yeah
launches in February February everyone
go out and buy them
all right there's new segments new new
segments segments where to go that much
not watch yeah I'm sorry I'm an extra
segment yes
now watch we're gonna talk really
briefly about a couple stories brainy
we've talked about net neutrality a lot
because we think it's important back in
December and net neutrality was done
away with by the currently current FCC
but some states are fighting back
Montana has become the first state to
implement net neutrality by themselves
as a States after the FCC repeal excuse
me the Montana Governor Steve Bullock
long signed an executive order on Monday
requiring internet service providers
with state contracts to abide by net
neutrality principles according to
Bullock this is a simple step states can
take to preserve and protect net
neutrality
we can't wait for folks in Washington DC
to come to their senses and reinstate
these rules
yeah and India if you talk about polls
across the u.s. and most people most
people like net neutrality want a net
neutrality want it to be a thing want it
to be a thing that we at least have some
guarantee of some enforcement of the FCC
was able to enforce it for quite some
time or at least since about 2015 prior
to that I was enforced by light-touch
regulatory framework but then Internet
service providers started pushing back
against that and actually doing stuff
that was outside of that causing the FCC
to have to take legal action
causing the Internet service providers
to countersue the FCC which is what led
to the FCC in 2015 saying all right
we're just gonna classify you guys as to
title to common carriers rather than
title one which is what they had been
before which gave the FCC the authority
to enforce net neutrality and that was
all fine and dandy for a couple of years
until I should find the current FCC
decided no we would rather apparently do
what all of the Internet service
providers want to do and what is in
their best interest rather than an
interest in most people
and roll that back anyway that's a brief
history of the net neutrality stuff over
the past couple years but good on you
Montana for going ahead with this
because it is something that the states
can take action on themselves granted
something that was at the federal level
would be better but maybe that will come
around as well here's the second article
from ARS technica about 21 the states
suing the FCC to restore net neutrality
rules nice
that's Meghna newborn she is almost half
the nation
yeah twenty-one states in the District
of Columbia oh I guess and sure half the
nation that's right Kyle sounds it
sounds better when you save them anyway
she is one of the five FCC commissioners
her and Jessica rosenworcel are the two
Democratic FCC commissioners it is
required by law by the way that the FCC
be splits and not have more than a 3-2
majority by any parties so it was
required for there to be two out of the
five commissioners be Democrat versus
Republican and as we talked about
Democrat versus Republican stuff and
lots of people might be more aligned
with on the side or the other it's
natural to hear something that might be
against your party and to feel negative
towards that we're not trying to make
this a political discussion or whatever
it just happens to be falling that way
when it comes to how the opposite sides
are voting we just have very strong
feelings about net neutrality when it
comes to technology and how we feel the
internet should work and in this case it
happens to be that the Democratic side
appears to be the ones who are pulling
for the rules and the configuration that
we feel would be most appropriate yes
that's why we're yeah it's not personal
we're like if we ever like we're not
speaking out or like hatin on
Republicans we're speaking out and and
and putting a magnifying glass on the
people who don't support net neutrality
just the Republicans just support matter
job it just it just so happens
that a lot of the people who don't
support net neutrality are Republicans
so this isn't really like we're
attacking Republicans on the first note
this is a transitive property thing or
it's like we are speaking out against
people who are against net neutrality
most of the people who are against
neutrality are in the Republican Party
so that it's it's nothing personal it's
just that it is what it is type of thing
there you go so 21 states in the
District of Columbia the states who are
suing the FCC are New York California
Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois
Iowa Kentucky Maine Maryland
Massachusetts Massachusetts Minnesota
Mississippi New Mexico North Carolina
Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont
Virginia and Washington and it just so
happens that every US state with a
democratic attorney general happens to
be every state who's suing the FCC in
this case the Republican state attorneys
general did not feel that they should
join in this particular petition for
whatever reasons they might have these
states filed a protective petition for
review which essentially reserves them a
spot in court challenges against the FCC
so those of course ongoing challenges to
the FCC's decision when it comes to that
neutrality we will continue talking
about it on this show because we think
it's important and that is all for net
watch for this week all right Night
Watch let's move on to the final
structured segment of today's show which
is gonna be sword fight guys sword fight
the classic long time segment where Cal
and I argue about something and in this
case we're gonna argue about video games
mmm and violence violent video games do
you know what have you ever been told
that you plan your violent video games
and that it's gonna make you be violence
as well apparently that's not you're
gonna end up killing everyone with a
samurai sword cow that's that true at
least according to the researchers at
the University of York there they have
found no evidence no there's oh they're
supporting it they found no evidence
no evidence to support the theory that
video games make players more violence
thank god they did a series of
experiments with more than 3000
participants they studied stuff such as
reaction time realism and then
specifically looked at combat games of
course the study is ongoing they
discussed the need for further work to
further distinguish more variables get
more data points when it comes to
researching this but as has been stated
many times before someone who is
predisposed to violence will be violent
anyway will be violent with or without
video games with or without in video
games and as is evidenced here the video
games may be a conduit for certain
people who have a predisposition but
playing violent video games does not
make you violent no of course not there
are no consequences in video games which
is what makes it so such an unconvincing
argument that it perpetuates violence in
real life because when you commit a
violent act in your life whether you're
an adult or a kid their consequences
their immediate repercussions for what
you did oh you punched a little Timmy in
the face well now you get a timeout then
you get suspended from school you're
currently pissed at you you punch some
dude in the face in gta5 nothing happens
to you you realize even as a young adult
or a young child that it there's a huge
difference there you don't necessarily
think well because I crushed over five
cars and 30 people in this tank rolling
down you know little Santos Avenue that
I can do that in real life and mom and
dad won't be mad at me there's a huge
disconnect there fortunately between
video games and IRL that I think people
are just always constantly looking for
someone to blame or something to blame
and video violent video games isn't easy
I mean there's there's violence in
American culture has violence everywhere
we're one of the few cultures that
actually have like super ultra violent
films and TV even on our TV shows on
basic cable that don't really have any
like age gate or anything are extremely
violent
to most other countries out there we're
like veiling what no let's ban that shit
because violence really exists in a real
sense overseas in other countries where
they don't want to perpetuate that but
it's like video games is like the
smallest threat if anything it's weird
the straw poll links apparently aren't
working properly in YouTube but sorry
about that so so made a bitly link thank
yourself for that he's on it
but yeah so since it has been so clearly
decided now that video games don't cause
violence we should obviously binge on
video game violence and so that's what
we're gonna argue about is what type hmm
a video game violence should be binge on
now that we know it doesn't affect this
cuz there's so many options so many
options in the video game well we got
your fantasy based violence you know
orcs versus humans and elves and they
you know warlocks about Avada Kedavra
and all that stuff now you got your
horror based balance you know your your
Resident Evil your Silent Hill
you know normally the monster created by
some thing and it's scary in the
monsters gonna come violently decapitate
you or whatever your war based your
shooter based violence feel you know
your battlefield color your player nones
battlegrounds you fall into this
category here of course yeah beat'em up
violence is very generic but this is
two-player like yeah it's scrolling type
like in your street fighters fire um
that kind of thing also maybe like your
your smash brothers this is very what I
saw you tweeting yesterday before oh
yeah actually wife is laughs and I were
up all night just like watching that
intensely watching smash brothers
tournaments is so entertaining and then
of course the violent entertainment
text-based games
yeah those are obviously leaving it up
to the imagination
typically do community
what would I'm gonna say the most
violently out of all these oddly enough
is violent text based games tax based
game I thought that violent text-based
games are the most gnarly because it's
just text so your brain your imagination
fills in the blanks of how that text
should look and play on paper which by
far and away I feel like your
imagination as a just the normal effed
up human beings that we are are
generally worse than the reality of of
any of these video again any anything
that these video games can portray
realistically your brain has far more
horrendous images to conjure up so I
think the violent text baked test text
based games are pretty gnarly I'm gonna
go with that one
I would probably like like a fundamental
level agree with you there and I
probably letting on with the same choice
but since I have to do something
different I'd say I'm gonna say war
shooter based violence and this is
primarily based on me trying to win and
the idea that the most popular games
right now is like you're playing guns
battlegrounds and also just you know
your battlefields is okay consummate
that pop collar is dominating popular
and you know FPS games that kind of
thing I mean like fantasy based violence
isn't even violent it's like I gave you
an evil potion higher your walk slower
where was it violence where where was it
that I saw there was some it was a
website or something like that lightning
I was talking about the number of deaths
in movies and like Lord of the Rings was
like like yeah just like everyone else
is a here here here and there's like
Lord of the Rings like just so cuz like
you consider eight these are masters
battles and cyanuric some people's just
much yeah dying
can you walk out of the film that you
walk out of the movie just lovely so
yeah because it's fantasy you see what
is real
that's a pass in the violent card yeah I
guess anyway
Mormon shooter like real-life people you
know faceless names you talk about war
and actual events like a lot of these
video games are based on actual wars
that happen battlefield one so yeah it's
a bit more raw and they can't make the
deaths quite as gratuitous because true
its historic it's it's based on history
mm-hmm right okay bill yep okay let's
see people thought the results here Oh
weren't you to go looks like I win
well Fran it fall like answer text base
I'll be pretty good there though you get
you got third they're not the fantasy
they're true almost twenty percent of
the votes
thank you probably guys who voted yep if
you're watching this is the future you
can flow go and vote again
no it'll meadow won't you no one will
ever go and view the straw poll again no
definitely not
I don't want that side what you mean
anything don't let that stop you
okay ah all right so hey that's all for
the prepared counts after my half let's
quickly run through sweet donations yes
where do you mind stopping yours begin
that's a good question I remember you
asking this one ha ha ha right
ha ha and be sit with M b67
yes after I did Matt no Cal's have oh
wait what where mine where a mine after
your cat did he sell the soul just
confused with us sela confused us he
confused which one of us was Paul and
which one was Kyle oh so it is it is
where it starts off on Kyle's I don't
think so yes I think you're right yeah
alright okay Joseph t-shirt t-shirt $5
donation wait for GP prices to drop or
next gen GPUs upgraded from an i5 760 to
a 77 ok but still in GTX 970
do 4 K keep up the good work cash if you
want for K I mean hold out for now
you're 970 is functional
price drop next-gen GPUs might come at
the exact same time stock coming back in
like it's really just a matter of like
if you really need something right now
you should sign up for website auto auto
notifications like from new egg and
Amazon and wherever else might have that
kind of function because that's really
gonna be your best bet is getting some
inventory right when it drops on a
retail site for MSRP for now hopefully
and another month or two things will
ease up a little bit but yeah it's hard
for us to predict too far out but but
good luck to you Joe automatic Matt five
dollar donation
hey guys scored his own attacks GT X
1080 mini for $600 so I'll have a micro
ATX build to submit for next week for
hit pet my PC nice also Paul ability CPC
I vote Matt I will the HCPCS like not
terrible compared to what we've been
seeing but I know I feel so torn being
like wow that's only for a mini more
than it should have cost yeah so that's
good that's bittersweet right kind of
but yes no but I'm sure it's gonna be a
very nice card for you and definitely
not crazy over price so there you go
through em b67
mister lenticular with a thirteen
dollars and 37 cent donation Paul I hope
that all goes well for you in your
family Cheers thank you very much for
that and and I hope the same for myself
we do some do see you know do she do she
five dollars I will be both equally I'm
going to eat the twenty-five dollars to
see if the power link will work okay
worried about blocking the - 4 pin fan
adapters on the back though if it's the
wraparound one and you've got the fan
adapters that stick out it probably will
just knowing where the power link goes
but those fan adapters aren't really
necessary they allow you to connect up
extra fans that operate at the same fan
speed it's like the fans on the GPU I
talked about the fan pins on the fan
heaven
card yeah the card itself has a couple
fan headers okay it's a specific 1/6
feature gotcha yeah I know but you don't
need to use those fan headers so yeah
give it a shot save works I hope it
works for you
bazinga X $10 you remind me of Howard
and Raj Big Bang Theory Big Bang Theory
only question is who is Howard and who
is Raj or are one of you Stuart
I probably rise because I'm the ethnic
one and I have the darker skin and the
Raza accent okay you can do the X okay
he's clearly Howard in this situation he
is the the typical white man and I'm
offending all Indian people of my
culture right now
apologize there are a lot of Indian
people in my high school I picked up on
it quickly I tried to be them never
hidden jujubes 13 dollars and 37 cents
again magic number think quick not with
that comment yes really have to cuz
really texting is hating that Scott
Dilbeck six dollars and success I have
one strict rx 580 for my living room PCM
crossfire Strix are export 80s in my
room PC should I be selling those for
profit if you need the money I mean
could you could to me for me it depends
like can you get by with those computers
without the graphics cards like if your
living room PC yeah if you never play
games on your living room PC and it's
got a 580 then ya sell it yeah like if
it still got an IG PU or something that
you can use to keep it functional then
you'll make a lot of money on that card
right now and chances are in 3 4 5
months hopefully when prices up settle
down if that happens you know you can
buy something else that's better but
yeah that's assuming prices settle down
yeah ex $50 please get some flowers on

guess we have one more of our Diego F
with for the 100m X which I have no idea
what currency that is I'm about to do my
first bill what are some tips for first
time builders and when is it a good time
to upgrade my graphics card since I
could not get a good one because the
current price is when's a good time to
upgrade your graphics card when the
prices fall down or when you could find
a good deal on one I don't know is here
o MX n Oh Mexican peso give me a Mexican
peso Mexican peso maybe MX is Mexican
peaceful no maybe not
maybe not
hmm people are saying peso which is
about 100 M X is like 5 USD yeah okay
all right that's fine
sounds good I just hadn't heard of that
before yeah we don't see that one too
much was just surprising because we're
pretty close to Mexico and stuff but I
would say yeah like I said wait wait for
grit for GPU prices to fall down before
you buy one honestly or if you can get
one a good deal online or something like
that um yeah but good luck good luck on
your first build I hope I hope it all
goes well for you yeah it's it's a rough
time honestly
so yeah just in time for your first I'll
focus on getting some of the core
components
aside from GPU and memory and then just
keep an eye on GP and memory prices and
hopefully those will come down in the
next couple months
oh we have one one more donation from
evocati productions $10 says Paul you're
