butter mm-hmm all right that's delicious
peanut butter cookie peanut butter
cookie it's a special cookie because
wipey sauce got it for us yeah and she
did it because she thinks we're great
yep um hello everyone and thank you for
joining us this is awesome hardware
episode number hundred and fifty-six if
it's your first time watching then good
thank you for being here this is a live
show
so we stream it live every week on
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time we stream to twitch TV / awesome
hardware and we also stream
simultaneously to our YouTube channels
so right now the first half of episode
156 go on my channel pulse hardware and
an hour or so we'll switch to side B and
that will be streamed to Kyle's channel
bit wit it's a collaborative effort
we've been doing for quite a while and
we're gonna keep doing it because it
involves just just some casual drinking
we drink beer we talk about technology
occasionally we use adult language so if
you are offended by that sort of thing
then don't watch or if you have kids
especially your plugs or I don't know
what you do but you don't want to chop
the kids to hear any of the words we're
saying because it's evil but cheers and
thank you all for being here today on
this lovely Tuesday evening July 24th
2018 are you gonna wait for you to
finish your damned toast sentence thing
and then I was gonna clink OH clink II
that's all
well said ball here are they drinking
Sierra Nevada Summerfest crisp lager it
is summer since it is summer a bit of a
heat wave here in Southern California
but real quick before we get going with
the actual tech news just may weird
noise and they throat if you like our
stuff if you want to help support us if
you know get yourself some nice
merchandise go to our stores and buy
stuff you buy during the show we'll give
you a little shut up at the end we shot
Johnson don't ask why and shirts mugs
pint glasses bottle openers it's all
good stuff constantly get positive
feedback
from it and we thank you for your
support and we hope you enjoy the Murch
pulsar bird net those my websites bit
wit tech slash store it's Kyle's
actually you can just go to bit with
tech now oh just got a bit with that
tech the store is now the homepage I
follow your footsteps both given up on
any semblance of ever like putting any
effort into a website there's just no
point it's just the store till until we
get really really really sick of YouTube
instead of just really really sick of
you and then but then it'll be like a
retro thing to go back to like written
written website stuff I don't think
we'll ever go that you know whoa there
see how that goes calm yourself thank
you oh thank you wifey sauce brought us
these beautiful glasses all nice and
clean these are available on the store
you can also buy on the site bottle
opener to open these bottles with how
did you open the last you I use the
bottle opener on my keychain which I
could easily grab right now if I wasn't
giving you the opportunity to plug your
bottle opener which is literally just in
front of you it's a left on the desk
right there
nice instead ETX one
I'm just so you do not sell our websites
that's not available but I do sell the
cool gamer evolution ones on yes so just
way better than the Nvidia one makes
bottle opening way easier than this
opener of the exact same shape with a
different logo on different design
alright I have I have just a smidgen of
things to talk about today the first
segment as indicated by that's even
that's wrong this week shut up why don't
we have one announcement oh oh yeah we
have a big announcement hold on but well
I'm in the middle of the changing this
I'm gonna do it anyway okay are are
there we go okay alright yes a big
announcement yep
so everyone occasionally makes donations
that using the YouTube donation thing
while we do our stream and this week to
celebrate
our moderators birthday self processing
huh and we just we just decided this
before the show all the nations are
going to sell for his birthday so if you
guys donated on the stream as we know as
hell dude she just did little did he
know that five dollars is going to sell
yep so that's a big say big thank you to
sell he's been he's been moderating our
stream for quite a while he's the best
he does a good job when we and we like
him and we like the things he does and
to say happy birthday we're gonna just
give him some cold hard cash because
what better way to say I love you right
money money speaks volume lame-o I show
submissions those wiping sauces idea um
to have donations for self but if it
weren't for me and Paul it would have
never happened anyway so we really we
take credit really yeah we where's our
best
so we approved it we did you know and
that would obviously wouldn't happen if
evident might be sauce is useless and
[Laughter]
will definitely change in a few hours
happy birthday so happy birthday sup
everyone donate yourself alright let's
get into my stuff I'm going to talk
about the rumor mill is the first
segment because the stuff we're gonna
talk about it here is all rumors it's
probably not even true
probably just pointless to you look up
your ass but first story here from
techradar.com about AMD Zen - I
personally am excited about in send -
because I have been very happy with all
of the Zen based things that AMD has
released over the past year and a half
or so Zen - is supposed to be seven
nanometer which is cool original Zen
first generation rise and stuff free and
first generation third upper step was
based on a fort was built on a fourteen
animator process that was original Zen
Zen Plus which is what the second gen
stuff is based on it's 12 nanometers of
small size shrink not that huge but a
bit so dropping it down to 70 nanometers
could mean many different things when it
comes to power efficiency I hope it does
not mean bad things when it comes to
like yields and their ability to
produce these because lots of us know
that Intel has had just to just did dill
is they've had a dilly of a pickle quote
Flanders getting their ten nanometer
stuff up and running so we should point
out from the echo here that this is
according to a Chinese forum user on
chip hill
that's where Chappelle's website Chinese
a lot of rumors originated from there
some sober true some or not so again
since this is the rumor mill everything
should be taken with a grain of salt but
the upcoming seven nanometers m2
architecture is said to potentially be
making sixteen core processors the norm
for am knees next-gen mainstream
mainstream and core CPUs so this is
significant in multiple ways because am4
when AMD launched it they made a promise
that that it was gonna be it had a life
cycle up until 2020 so whether that's
the end of 2020 or the beginning of 2020
that's still a decent amount of time
still left on this product life cycle
but a lot of people thought I mean or
speculated that when when the Zen plus
stuff came out second generation rising
2000 series he views like I feel so on
top of it this time whereas when Kyle
was talking about that last week yeah
yeah yeah and I was totally baffled by
it venereal the names mixed up point
being the the second dense stuff has
been pretty exciting I mean it's not
like super amazingly better than the
first gen stuff but it was a nice step
up and it gave some nice options and
some more memory compatibility so people
were happy with it and I was kind of
thinking like I had maybe that's all
present or 4 a.m. for for their current
platform and they're gonna let this ride
for you know you're here so and then
whatever next-gen stuff comes out
they'll have a new platform for it but
if they're actually gonna have third
generation like Rison 3000 series
processors on mainstream am 4 that's
kind of interesting now obviously since
this is all early and still speculation
we don't know like does that mean that's
like your your 300 series chipset
motherboards with a m4 or suddenly gonna
support 3000 series rise in 16 core
processors
like that seems like a little bit of a
stretch to me I could I could see it
potentially being like all right
whatever whatever the third generation
rise and stuff is is going to be
compatible with 400 series motherboards
because I'll get an we'll get to in just
a sec but there's a little bit more of
immersion
based on that but it is true that at
Computex 2018 AMD did debut very first
seven nanometer actual silicon as n2
silicon it was an epic processor but all
of the rise and thread Ripper epic stuff
right now is all based on the same rise
and die that they originally made that
eight core die that they used one of
four main stream processors or 4 of 4
shredder per an epic stuff so yeah if
they can make a 14 nanometer
architecture first gen Rison with 8
cores on that little die that they made
for it then it would stand to reason
that if you shrink the process from 14
and 1/2 down to seven nanometer then you
could have about the same size chip with
double the course that's not an A to B
comparison but I mean that is one of the
benefits of the die shrink so it doesn't
seem like that big of a stretch
but I think I think the big question
would be when when would this actually
be happening and we don't know I don't
think we've heard of anything very soon
when it comes to actual concrete release
dates apart from third refer to stuff
which AMD didn't say it was coming in q3
what do they say q3 did to say August
July whatever soon soon very poor to the
lines blur of what I can say and what I
can't say exactly but you know I
wouldn't even be surprised if if Zen 2
is is somehow supported on like the X
370 boards or something like that
I feel like AMD just like always
surprises me with their backwards
compatibility and how flexible their
platforms are
because and the reason also is because I
don't think x4 70s that much different
the next 370 so I feel like it wouldn't
be a huge it wouldn't be completely
far-fetched to think that it would be
supported on both maybe certain features
wouldn't work or work as well something
with you know maybe maybe like the
precision boost 3.0 whatever they're
gonna call it later on doesn't function
the same on an older chipset board or
something like that but I've been I've
been pretty pleasantly surprised by AMD
and just how flexible they are with with
newer launches where which is like the
total polar opposite model of Intel
right I'd say in most cases we're adding
more cores that warrants a completely
new platform you'd have to buy a new
motherboard and you know got out your
system or whatever so I don't know but
we'll see it'll be interesting so it's a
great way for AMD to stick it to Intel
to point out an area that they have not
been as kind to consumers by creating a
product that doesn't do that but it has
a little bit more forward compatibility
but it would be cool if you bought a 300
series board when they first became
available to suddenly like two plus
years later be like hey this new
processor you're coming out I can still
slow into that board I don't see like a
B 350 you know like a $70 be 350 board
able to run a 16 grower third gen rise
and chip you know at full speed all the
time so I don't know a lot to see what
they actually do but there's there's a
little bit of official word from AMD but
not much they're they're labs are
networking ends and they're working Xen
to into retail products then one other
thing to point out just as a follow up
there's a tech powerup article also
linked in the description all those
stories were talking about by the way
guys were linked in the description if
you want to read more msi dropped a bit
of a hint about AMD increasing the aim
for cpu counts because they posted a
video this video has now been taken down
so that maybe maybe they took it down
because the video had actual legitimate
information but the video described an
AMD be 450 chipset supporting 8 core and
cpu's it doesn't seem like they put and
up this or something where the main
chords yeah or it was just something
that was like poorly chant translated
from Chinese to English or something and
I was actually more up to eight cores
that's possible too but you know it's
the rumor mill so what you're talking
about rumors it's at work there you go
then - very interesting a lot of stuff
to ponder here
well we're pondering it pondering
pondering the out of it okay
that's been a rumor here this one's from
PC perspective I believe originally from
W CCF tech who published what they claim
is leaked GeForce GTX 1170 benchmarks by
the way of this mysterious looking
picture of a of a monitor screen here
that's not real monitor yeah it is
slightly suspicious though it's a
picture of a screen but in this picture
you can see clearly listed the NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1170 obviously obviously
that is irrefutable evidence that it
exists and that this is a legitimate
picture of a computer screen just to
clarify this was found on polish
hardware forums quote-unquote I don't
know if enough Poland has nationalized
hardware forums or if the earth the
article is more specific but whatever
if this screenshot is true the results
show this gtx 1170 long rumored video
card from nvidia now this would be below
a gtx 1180 in that product stack in
performance as well as price but
according to this results twenty two
thousand nine hundred and eighty nine in
was fire strike yeah that would that
would actually be a higher score than a
1080i so that would be pretty impressive
for eleven seventy also in the
screenshot you can see the memory listed
here 16384 megabytes with 16 gigs of
memory would also be a pretty big jump
up considering that even like your
Titans right now I have 12
or your love your 1180 I'm sorry your
1080 eyes have 11 and you're ten days
and ten 70s have eight gigs respectively
so all of that said there's a lot of
shadiness and potential reason for this
not to be legitimate going on here
it's picture of monitor fire strikes
scores as also demonstrated in the
article are very easy to manipulate all
you need to know is played some basic
HTML editing or having it have a web
editor why do they have Wayman why don't
they have Valle up like like what are
obviously they're in the middle of an
intense benchmarking run with a bunch of
different things and they didn't had
they only had the split second to take
the screen shot in between running their
various benchmarks about they're
covering stuff up oh the valley
probably like a giant you know Adobe
Photoshop honestly if they're fudging
results here anyway then yeah I also
pointed out 3d mark updates their
database with different graphics cards
as they're available if you benchmark a
graphics card with 3d mark before it's
actually released or early enough that
it's not in their database yet it would
not say NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1170 right
here and say like I forget exactly what
it says unidentified graphics card or
something like that right so yet another
reason why this is it's actually excuse
me that's one that true but it's also
leaking information that EVGA is perhaps
it does they do point the finger
squarely at EVGA as far as the source of
this leak it says it's an EVGA
corporation sourced video card old
allegations yes sir but obviously proves
16 gig gtx 1170 is running at 2.5
gigahertz that sounds are pretty damn
good for sweet that sounds pretty damn
fast ok one more room or near this one
directly from from hassanover a WCC of
tech so this is about Intel's ninth
generation flagship series of processors
further confirmation yet again provided
by the super legit
source Chinese websites Chappell who
Lawler no this is cool all cool all
accomplished
many of them who Hassan says is a source
which has been legit with their previous
leaks so you know you can accept that or
you can you can think it's full of
garbage but we're gonna keep going down
these leaks here they actually posted
this bit of a chart about the three
top-end SKUs from Intel's purported
upcoming ninth generation flagship bear
in mind these are not die shrink CPUs
this is not canon like this is still
copy lake this is still a revision of
coffee lake still 14 nanometer but they
said they're gonna have at least three
case Q's there k Series C excuse which
would be unlocked the top end oneness
the I $9.99 hundred K then they got the
i7 9700 K + the f5 9600 cake 9900 k is
at eight core sixteen to her processor
9700 case eight cores without your hyper
threading so only eight threads and your
9600 K is six cores and six threats feel
like you're missing something like in
the like a 6 quart 12 third processor
range or something but anyway um 9900 K
if this is accurate will boost on one or
two cores all the way up to five
gigahertz at stock which is fairly
impressive on all course it will go to
4.7 gigahertz all these CPUs have a 95
watt TDP and your 9700 K will get up to
4.9 gigahertz um one or two cores I'm
one core I guess and your 9600 K will
get up to 4.6 gigahertz on one core four
point six care it's all cores for the
ninety seven under K in 4.3 gigahertz
all cores for the 9600 K there's a
little bit more information in the chart
here such as they're theorized prices of
450 350 and a $250 for these three
processors respectively 60 Meg cache 12
the 9 Meg's for the 9700 K and 9600 K so
I mean this all seems within the realm
of possibility it also seems somewhat
impressive it also seems like if Intel
is really hitting higher these higher
frequencies
with not that different of silicon
versus what they've they've currently
got then maybe they really are doing
like a soldered soldering heat spreader
or something like that to give
themselves a little bit more thermal
Headroom right and that seems like
legitimate possibility there there's
been other rumoured CPUs in this stack
of 9000 series processors and there's
also some information in the article
about what they think the 300 series
Cabul 8 refresh well had as well we're
not sure about that still there's been a
rumored Z 390 chipset but then it was
hurt we've heard that that Z 3 and
anything was scrapped and that it's
still gonna be Z 370 but they'll have an
updated requirement for Z 370 so yeah
all this stuff is still up in the air
but does seem like there is some stuff
coming out from Intel perhaps a little
bit more of an answer back for the rise
and stuff the name D is AG because you
know they do they need they need higher
quartets they need they need to be able
to come back at that and you know they
want to get my recommendation then
that's the way they got to go so yeah
there it is that's been me that's all we
have for rumor mill cool so let's move
on to some some real news which is we
can trust these ones and perhaps
slightly more trustworthy but I don't
really know most of this stuff is it's
all lies it's all from the internet so
this is true say about that right here's
an article from the verge Asus Phillips
as well some other companies have been
fined for price fixing in Europe's
finest handed down by the European
Commission busted they also recently
handed Google a five billion dollar
antitrust fund that was a record Wow and
these four more funds for these four or
more companies were announced today or
yes today this is from the 24th so um
asus is probably the company that you
guys are most maybe you work the most I
mean Phillips um pioneer obviously
they're they're pretty well known Dena
and merits I don't know if they do much
in the US there they weren't a company I
was familiar with but all four of these
offending parties have admitted to
interfering with the pricing of online
retailers so as to maintain artificially
high prices for their products none of
them worked together so there was no
collaboration or collusion going on
between these four companies no
collusion but
they all did get fine for the same thing
which is why it's all kind of grouped
together in the same announcement
asus intervened to prevent online
retailers in Germany and France from
selling its laptops and displays below
it's recommended resale prices so
basically try to maintain high prices
adenine and Marantz kept the pricing of
their headphones and speakers in Germany
and the Netherlands higher than the
market could otherwise sustain Philips
engaged in similar shenanigans with
almost its entire entire portfolio of
products and France everything from
kitchen appliances to vacuum cleaners to
electric toothbrushes and trimmers
pioneers spend the widest geographical
range with 12 affected EU Member States
gone for gun for the geographic win I
think it was at the domination victory I
think for civilization
okay but yet 12 EU Member States
including Germany France in the UK all
of these companies have cooperated with
the European Commission and for that
cooperation they got a 40% discount on
their fines 40% off okay
that's reasonable issues though will
still have to pay seventy four point
four million dollars Dena and Moran
spent nine million Phillips thirty four
point nine million pioneer eleven point
nine million so Asus is the big the
biggest purpose Asus apparently it was
the most money they were the biggest by
double over what they were
they were cocked with the most stuff bad
stuff the most price fixing I don't know
it's like in like when you're playing
you know and somebody goes out and you
have to pay for all the cards that are
still in your hand so what happens what
happened with you I mean if you're
keeping score oh who the hell keeps
scored you know I don't even know that
was a thing how would you not keep score
how are you gonna tell who wins it's
just whoever they're not revered whoever
goes out first is the winner
yeah of one game yeah then you play a
new game and there's a new winner I'm a
casual you know player because I was
aware I wasn't aware that there is
anything more no no actual you know play
when you play who know you have to set
up your brackets you know with different
various teams it's naturally you usually
go with the double elimination you know
there's a if you're if you're if you
come in as a high ranked team you might
get a bye in the first round it's a very
that's it that's all you know is not
efficient should not be a competitive
game this is like this is like having a
gta5 online tournament it's ridiculous
absolutely preposterous yeah let's move
on clearly valve has banned over 60,000
steam accounts smashing its previous
record bells all I was very proud of
banning banning who's a band scammers
scammers right sure bands people who
deserve to be banned
I'm sure no one's been presuming of
course that all these assholes deserve
to be banned
this actually occurred about a week ago
60,000 accounts are banned on Tuesday
July 17th via the valve anti-cheat
system or vac now this was the largest
vac wave in the platform's history and
it's at the article seems slightly I'm
slightly confused by the way it says
this because it says 60,000 steam
accounts were banned on Tuesday and then
it says but Wednesday morning the
banhammer really started swinging with
28,000 411 accounts being
throughout the day sada and it does that
mean that it's a total of 88,000 I think
man that's what it that's what it seems
to be saying so why wouldn't you put
that in the headline 60,000 I'm saying
his PC games in you gotta lead you know
you gotta leave with your numbers you
know you're Scott draw best before gets
the eyeballs you know the stats you got
to tell them how many people died we
could write this so anyway just just
clarifying that it was a child valves
vac system watches over a number of
games including Counter Strike global
Offensive csgo dota 2 Call of Duty
series and Ark survival evolved as it
valves zero-tolerance speaking colorants
valves zero-tolerance policy much like
mine when I drink beer means that their
band will never be overturned so these
people are banned forever forever their
firm stance we're never banned from like
that steam forever banned unless they
open a new account then but then they
would have to link that into account
with a different phone number and they
would have to buy their games all over
again which buying the games all over
again is that's gotta be the probably
the hardest part hey getting a different
phone number is pretty easy use anyone
have this one yeah come on your house
yeah just or just punch in random random
members and hope you never have to do
account recovery verification all right
I don't have notes for this story but I
did want to at least point out that it
has been published Backblaze is a
company Hey they run data centers but
they run it in a kind of unique way in
that they use consumer hard drives and
often used consumer hard drives in their
data centers so they have a methodology
that is basically assuming the drives
will fail so these lots of drives some
of them have shorter life spans than
others and every quarter they publish a
report of how many drives they have in
use and their failure rate and this is
not the most scientific breakdown of
like overall drive failure rates but it
is somewhat interesting to look at so if
you've got that grain of salt
take the tastes on your lips then you
can proceed to look at some of these
numbers and again I apologize for not
having notes for these but reporting
period there's four cute - that's April
it's in June 2018 they use drives
ranging in size from four terabytes up
to ten terabytes and you can see how
many drives of each type they actually
used they're from HGST Seagate Toshiba
and Western Digital so for instance some
of the drives that they only have a few
of down here you definitely definitely
should not assume this is any sort of
indication as to the like overall
failure rate of the drives because you
need a massive sample size in order to
really determine that however some
drives like Seagate's 4 terabyte SD 4000
here you know they have 27,000 of those
going so a 1.8 5 percent failure rate
there on that many drives that's pretty
decent it's the highest one there's that
no so the secretary decent well the the
highest if you're looking at actual
annualized failure rate is gonna be this
4 terabyte HD ST but they only had 78
drives and one of them failed so that
was that was a relatively high count
there so anyway um get 2 million away
those days okay drive yeah how many days
that drive days of that bits that many
drives times these days they were in use
I see there's also what is this one this
is from April to June inclusive what's
the difference between these two charts
I don't know I'm waiting for since 0.08%
different dates well I'm not gonna I'm
not gonna reporting period April 2013 to
June 2018 oh ok so sorry this is this is
their lifetime this is for everything
you're right Kyle I thought the three
was an 8 there and I was like wait now
this is still mm-hmm you think I say so
this is you can see all of the drives
that they've used for many many
different places why are they using
Comic Sans or so if you want if you want
the drive that's been used that they had
the most Seagate 12 terabyte here
that's not too bad anyway the WD I could
have to sit here and and and sort of
crunch these numbers to get some some oh
look here they did that yeah terabyte
consumer drives have a 1.1 percent
annualised failure rate enterprise
drives have a 1.2 percent annualised
failure rate oh my god what why are we
buying enterprise drives wait
when consumer drives fails slightly less
that makes no sense but wait no
nevermind
as of q2 2018 and a terabyte consumer
drives 1.3 percent enterprise 0.97 so
you just got to give it time you know
time that's so slight though that's such
like a it's like an any when you run it
leave a center though that's it that's
significant is it it's point zero six
percent very significant yeah that's the
money equals money right name for the
amount of money extra that you're paying
for enterprise drives is it worth the
point zero six percent failure rate it's
a peace of mind Cal it's peace of mind
that you have that much less of a
failure we need a money per failure rate
percentage point ratio chart benchmark
that's what they're they're been a few
times when when another publication has
taken these Backblaze reports and then
like actually made some graphs and
that's always fun when that happens but
I had it this one can delete today's
line up so I did not do that okay one
one less I'll start here this one was
kind of fun first it says a two parter
so this is the gamers Nexus hardware and
news that published yesterday which has
multiple things that they're they talked
about but the thing I wanted to
specifically talk about was the fake
quote-unquote faces on beef for 50
motherboards which is this is gamers
Nexus reporting based on a builds Lloyd
video where he took a look at some of
these
upcoming be 450 motherboards pictures of
their actual MOSFET layout power
delivery and he determines that I'm
gonna read this off so I don't I don't
screw it up so much it said that we've
seen boards in the past a new doubling
scheme is where they go to high side to
low side and - chokes I'll driven by one
driver and they call it two phases but
gigabyte axed the high side my offset
MOSFET on the be 450 resulting in one
high side to low side to choke someone
drivers so um it's it's it's basically
removing more componentry from that
power delivery ABCD that that it goes
through when you're going from the
12-volt that the power supply delivers
to the more finite amount of voltage
that the CPU is actually able to use but
it's sort of a tricky way that they did
it in order to potentially still be able
to say oh we have this eight phase power
delivery on this you know inexpensive
p450 motherboard when they're leaving
out some key components we cut which can
actually affect that power delivery and
result in lesser performance for the
board
Steve's video talks a little bit more
about that I'm not going to go further
onto it right now but upside is that
after talking about this publishing it
it does look like they've got had some
direct response from the industry in
that as rocking gigabyte have now both
updated their product pages so yeah so
as arcing gigabyte after catching that
critique and build Zoid just pointing
out like hey this really isn't kind of a
legitimate configuration like it
reminded me a little bit it's not
exactly the same thing like AMD's older
eight core processors like the 80 PT 150
and stuff like the old bulls and
bulldozers and stuff there were some
complaints about that because of
resource sharing between the various
cores that they weren't true eight core
processors and in certain benchmarks
that that I did actually play out so a
good job builds oi for going in there
and like having the details
look at that that he did because there's
not many people who go into that level
of detail and right have that amount of
knowledge about the various surface
mounted components and whatever they go
on the motherboard so they can look at
it and see how it's all lined up there
right I certainly can't do that
nope but leave that to the pros wanted
to point that out
anyway welcome both links are in the
description if you guys want to check
that out further not all heroes wear
keeps thank you hi mom I'm Jess okay
lets us move on though that is pretty
much all I've got for my half of the
show sorry this is a little bit shorter
than usual that's okay my buddy have
somebody should use Cal's Kyle's got a
short half - you're not alone both
shorties today we're gonna quickly run
through some donation comments once
again happy birthday sell all this money
goes to him and not us yes
starting with Guido Sarducci $5 donation
wait I should put the whole thing up
there here we go that's better
he said currently rebuilding my 1700 x
RG strix 1070 TI system cleaning out the
dust and such while watching the show
I'll tag you on Twitter with clean pics
yeah you know here's your best of luck
give me them clean that's a great that's
a very like like I feel like you're
getting work done while you watch our
show which is weird because normally I
don't feel like the show let's work it
kind of is but not really it's not work
for us but at least at least other
people watching it can work at the same
time probably because you know we try to
keep the show as as easy for the mind as
possible in fact you probably lose brain
cells when watching this show yeah I
don't think anyone so it only makes
sense that you're able to take on other
tasks simultaneously thank you you know
ty grimsy are one with $10 our what is
our rupees Romulan Robin Robin Ted and
Robin ten ten dollars and Robin Kevin
and Robin bucks tiger I mean that says
hello Kyle and Paul should I buy the new
GTX or a good ol a good box of cold beer
I don't think those are gonna be the
exact same price and be more like buying
you know
a lot of boxes of cold beer or the new
GTX depends on tonight true I think long
term there are some very expensive beers
out there I think long term you'll be
more happy with the new graphics card
because you buy the new graphics card
and you can play games on it for every
years whereas your appears like a night
and you'll probably like after you buy
the graphics card you know give yourself
a week or two or a month or so and then
you'll probably be able to scratch
scrape together some money to buy some
beer too
and you can have your cake and eat it
too that's always fun thank you for
donation up good advice Baja truck guy 5
dog nation says happy birthday sell whoo
that's a great way to say happy birthday
it's Baja cash why thanks Baja truck at
Grim Reaper ten eighty ten dollars in 69
cents specific I'm editing a 10 second
video right now it's the hardest thing
I've ever done I completely feel you
there the shorter the shorter you want
to make the video if you're like I'm
gonna make one minute videos that's a
stupid it's a bad idea
that's why Linus didn't make his fat
like tech quickie he didn't make it like
five minute tech or whatever it's too
harsh
cuz it's too hard he made it as fast as
possible which is nonspecific which
means right whatever the length in which
really means nothing if you promise five
minutes it's gonna take you yes 100
minutes more so we feel your pain but he
says anyway what beer would you
recommend to a new drinker I've tried
Bud and whatnot but don't like the
alcoholic bland taste I got started on
Fat Tire Fat Tire Fat Tire is a good
that was the forget that was the first
like beer that that kind of like got got
my feet wet a little bit with like craft
beer yeah nothing too bold nothing too
adventures but but something that
definitely tastes a lot more full-bodied
has a bit thicker body than in Bud Light
and stuff and the crappy American
domestic beers that was that was my
gateway beer and opened up a whole load
of doors to other great beers arrogant
bastard also I have to say is that at an
entry like it depends on how bold is a
new drinker cuz I liked it the first
time I had it but not everyone is gonna
be the same so
yeah I like your bastard might have a
hard time with our get better at the
game sure yes somebody recommended Sam
Adams I think Sam Adams is a good option
yeah Newcastle is it is a decent brown
ale Newcastle fire stone just find an
Amber find an amber yeah something multi
with a little malt but avoid pills
because that's basically what all
American domestic beers are yeah there
are much better pilsners out there like
from Europe and stuff but they might
still taste a little bit too similar
Oh MB 6770 Christine it's from San
Francisco that's a good one too
you like it yep okay there's lots of
this so many could be red stripe is
drinkin hopefully some of these have
provided good suggestions for you
Michael la voce $10 says happy birthday
so Eddie
thank you Michael happy birthday short
and sweet NB 67 $35 oh my god whoo happy
birthday cell thank you sir
Paul I hope that you had a great time at
Comic Con sure sure he'll just shoot if
I had a great I'm a Comic Con MBI I
don't care my main goal is to make sure
Kyle didn't have a good time
yeah you succeeded well time I was just
like poking him and took its camera and
threw it on the ground you don't even
have to cuz I was just dying to be with
you all weekend that was bad enough he
kept appearing in his vlog and he's a
 tell him in his blog was stupid you
look stupid
no we both we both had a very good time
it was great Steve was there too yeah
it's good good got you bro out touch
each other's dicks poop Shepherd pups
Shepherd $5 speaking of dicks
I saw Jays should you wait for 1180
video I was thinking you just said
speaking of dicks I saw James no that is
what you just said that's pretty good
plan we need a clip of that right now
even Jay admits to being a dick hole
that's it that's his quaint phrase
that's just a very like a seamless
speaking of dicks well initially I was
actually thinking about pub Shepherd
because because he's pup Shepherd I
won't go into further detail as to why
I'm connecting the dots there but I
guess it works in multiple ways and
that's a beautiful thing so anyway I saw
Jays should you
for the 1180 video I was thinking I have
a 980ti on an FX 8350 I can get 40 to
120 fps medium to high settings to
extreme at wide quad HD there's a there
is a chance depending on the game you're
playing that your FX 8350 is holding
your 980 T back a little bit yeah
especially wqhd I mean you're talking
higher than 1080 resolution but that
said you have a pretty decent setup
right now 980 and I would say my forum
upgrade is in order if your question is
whether or not you should wait for the
1080
therefore the 1180 then then yes you
should because right now I think you're
doing all right yeah yeah you're solid I
better say yeah save your money and then
once that comes up i would i would
recommend saving it for a whole system
upgrade i mean if you've already got a
pretty you know mid to high ends kind of
kind of configuration and upgrading from
there you want to go higher end so I
would want kind of the newest newer
platforms you know what are your talking
Intel or AMD yep bazinga X $10 how is
your solar power your solar cells
working out sorry would be more last
week bad week oh that's ok
visiting it thank you solar cells
working great although right now because
it's super hot certainly not like I'm
using about tooth can't get my
percentages right - like I'm generating
about this much with the solar and I'm
using about this much energy overall so
I'm definitely using more than I'm
generating right now the battery helps
me use all of the solar that I generate
which is cool but this is the months the
months of the year when in the original
charts that they give you where they
look at your energy usage and like how
much they expect to be generating this
is the time of year when the usage is
definitely gonna be higher than what
it's able to to put out just because I
can't run the AC all the time on my
array I'm like I would need more solar
panels and stuff
do that right but it's still making me
use signal s overall than I would be
otherwise it's cool I'm glad that's
working out for you yeah
kickin wings 7 2 3 $5 hey guys I turned
21 yesterday happy birthday to you sir
and finally sharing her here with y'all
keep doing what y'all do and have a nice
night and sell enjoy a beer on me way to
be responsible wait till you 21 to enjoy
that beer yeah that's what we recommend
here on the show
yep and then you can be degenerate
asshole afterwards no probably not
I mean drink responsibly talk to me
after the show John show $25 love the
show would love to send you some magical
oh no I totally read that machine some
local Michigan beers to have an awesome
hardware nothing magical about that or
is there sounds magical to me we would
love to try some beer from Michigan ed
John you're welcome to do that people
have been sending us things to drink and
eat and we keep drinking and eating them
despite that you know it's all been good
so you know let's yeah the bar pa boxes
are usually in our video descriptions so
you check out the video description for
that lines down there yeah and make sure
that you pack your beer very well
because sometimes we get beer that has
leaked because it wasn't packaged
properly and it's a real shame so mine
thank you guys Tyler Callaghan $30
I got whoa hey guys I never seem to be
around for these but I love your content
and appreciate the time you take to
provide us entertainment you're welcome
Tyler
we appreciate you donating money and
commenting and watching and sell
especially appreciate you donating money
heck to the freakin yen all right
Michael we'll Sechrist my cozy cursed
$10 looking to build my first gaming PC
should I go X 474 forward compatibility
um Michael it would probably be worth
your while right now to hold up for not
very long we're not a percent sure but
not very long it seems like until B for
50 launches X for 70 is really only
required if you're gonna go for a two
way GPU configuration which most people
aren't going to do that said if you want
to overclock then
your mid-range to high-end x4 70 boards
often have better power delivery setups
so if you if there's a board you like
right now and it's not like super
expensive and then you can go for it if
not maybe hanging out see the B 450
boards to come out and see if there's
one that's like not like low-end or
entry-level because you want spend a
little bit more to make sure that you
can overclock yeah that would be you
well we'll be talking about some be 450
boards on my half the show that are that
are seemingly available oh good yeah a
lot of options so stay tuned tobin $10
the PC I built that should be that
should be getting a hundred a hundred
FPS easy and yet I only get 60fps any
ideas I can't send the link through this
chat if so thank you yes you guys are
awesome it's opening the first potential
suspect there would be vsync if you're
getting 60 frames per second
consistently you might just have vsync
on either in the game you're playing or
the global vsync setting in the GPU has
been Nvidia Nvidia control panel has
global settings yeah then you can apply
if he sync is on its gonna cap your
framerate it's the same refresh rate
that your monitor has which is usually
60 Hertz for most standard monitors
unless you have a higher refresh rate
monitor yeah but yeah that that'd be
mine but without further information
that would be my first guess it's
probably accurate also make sure you
have up-to-date drivers with everything
and see if you can find other people who
have very similar configurations to you
when it comes to CPU and graphics card
that have maybe tested the same games
that you're playing and see if you can
get you know more direct comparison to
somebody else's using the same
configuration to see where you should be
at yeah hopefully that helps Atlas $5 do
either of you have a guess as to when
the new evolve X will be available also
why did you rebranded de bit whit you
don't know when the evolve X will be
available didn't they say a rough ETA
it's supposed to be this year I want to
say October October I want to say
October cuz I remember thinking like oh
that's like my birthday time
because I was born in October so I want
to say October that sounds very familiar
to me I don't know if that's changed
since then but I'm pretty sure that's
what they said at Computex and as for
the rebranded bit with question um
there's there's a few reasons why
rebrand it to be wet I won't go to into
detail because there's videos and stuff
about it but I just felt like it was a
little bit more professional than
awesomesauce Network and I kind of
outgrew it I just outgrew that name and
I wasn't really happy with it I just
felt like it was time to do the tattoo
analogy a change yeah good old tattoo
analogy it's like a tattoo that you got
when you were a teenager you don't
regret it
you've just outgrown it and that's kind
of how I still feel about the old
awesomesauce
even though it has a special place in my
heart those feel so peaceful than you
when you say that yeah yeah it fills me
with my Zen is centered and everything
not to be a am deep under a very wise
yes but if you would like to contribute
to the big wave cause I also have a just
really quick plug a design a logo design
contest that's that's just underway yeah
as of today
cash prizes and all that if you guys
want to help me design a new logo for
the channel pretty much all all skill
levels and countries are eligible so
check that video out but thank you very
much for the donation atlases activist
$10 happy birthday so happy birthday
cell yeah more money personality
thank you very much for that donation
Randall singleton $10 I have or Corsair
LED strips to channel and for industrial
n ff12 connected to a commander Pro when
I turn on my rig the same to fans don't
spin regardless of channel I have to
unplug and plug in wild rig is on to
make it work my turn my rig the same two
fans don't spin up for girls that the
channel I have to unplug
that sounds like you have a power issue
sounds like a very issue that you seem
to fans don't spin regardless of chin
you have to unplug it it sounds like it
might be at your commander Pro is
defective yeah it sounds like a hardware
failure because in my experience with
the commander pros if you're plugging in
just the pwm fan and power to it like
all the whatever's plugged in just spins
up although i haven't delved into the
software very much so i don't know if
there's anything in there any setting in
there that you know it might have tried
to apply to the commander pro that it's
got it messed up or something but um I
would probably contact Corsair about
that because it seems like not the way
that the commander pro should be working
definitely not sorry sorry we can't give
you more detailed response than that but
good luck Matt bon bon dollars when we
be finishing the htpc paul saj soon it's
not like it's not like you've been
working on like other amazing projects
that require time like building super
fancy $10,000 custom water-cooled pcs
the hell are you doing all your time
Paul where's the stupid HTC I I need to
I need to figure that I would damn it
there's still I need my HTTP C contents
all there's wood beetles in the piece of
wood you owe me this I can't I can't go
and start preparing that piece of wood
while they're still like like like
little little wood shavings that poop
out of it every so often cuz there's
there's just like waiting I'm like maybe
they'll just die and then it won't that
won't happen anymore but then everyone
smile like go on other than there's a
little pile of em so I probably need to
take it back to where I originally got
it and have him reek in it in order to
kill those like that's probably honestly
well there'd be like a wood beetle video
first that precedes the matter just get
my drill and like everywhere there's a
little wood beetle hole I just attack it
and drill
to drill it out like would there like
wood Gophers yeah so he to bomb those
efforts oh I I still want to do it but
um yeah I need to figure I need to
figure that out man thank you for
continuing to encourage me to finish my
HTPC to encourage its and roush why are
five Canadians one beer for sale yeah
you get a pretty good good beer out of
five dollars or you can get like you
know three beers
if you're buying a six-pack so really
sell has his options laid out for him
thanks to you mr. Swire we appreciate
your donation even it even if it is from
a Canadian oh whipped cream I forgot I
had that that's been there for a while I
wouldn't trust it
not that I would trust whipped cream
much in general but especially one
that's been in that fridge for months on
end um okay bust not the stouts where
did this modern times be a copy rusty
stout this is delicious and it's from
San Diego where we just were at Comic
Con
okay so relevant I am Tobin $5 risin
three MSI gaming m7 with two gtx msi
1070 TI's in sli with 32 gigs of DDR for
I can't send a pc part picker link you
know that's really a shame when you have
such a high end system and it doesn't
even let you send links it just sounds
like such a waste of hardware oh I
probably read this Rison 3 I'm just
kidding I'm just don't freak out yet oh
so I'm not sure why she's asking Tobin
yeah there's not really a question here
I think maybe he's asking if the part
selection is that a good build
everything seems pretty high I don't
don't don't don't go 1070 T is Li
especially we go go with a single 1080
TI that's what you're thinking about or
arise in 3 is by far the low you know
the bottleneck in this one yeah but I'd
say with a 1080 Ti
and 32 gigs of DDR for that maybe like a
1700 or at 2700 good choice yeah
and just make sure you get like an 8
core once yeah balanced setup or a 6
core hyper credit Intel chip and I would
potentially wade out hold out to see
what NVIDIA has to offer in the realm of
next-gen graphics cards yes riot 4 5 6
for 7 dollars I love your channels how
would I work for y'all and you guys are
great um well if we really needed help
from from the masses and let's say we
had a job opening I'm sure that we would
you know I know I would probably like
create a video I upload a video saying I
need help send in your resumes and
applications this is what I'm looking
for I'll let you know when I need one of
your help
one of yours helps helps us miss
specifically right now I'm good I'm a
little ragtag team I'm enjoying it I
don't have any openings available
unfortunately no maybe eventually I've
never I've never really aspired to be a
job creator
yeah I'm not I'm not an Elon Musk type I
mean that may be so healthy azzam we
expand slowly but steadily that's that's
kind of the mo here I want to overextend
ourselves thank you right you just okay
all right we're on $5 but it'd be weird
to see a flashed or overclocked Atari
Jaguar or turbo graphics 16 etc to be
benched maybe liquid metal and water
cooling on them that's a really old
turbo graphics 16 is like wow that's
really old Atari Jaguar is could you
even over call of it um I mean I'm sure
there's a way if you really really knew
what you were doing and you could get in
and like modify firmware and stuff like
that
but I don't know how you would benchmark
a turbo graphics 16
like you play altered beast that like
144 FBI got a hundred and I got a high
refresh rate display or something I
don't know that would be like III like
this from a conceptual standpoint I just
there's so many questions about how you
would actually do it but I would be
curious you know so I made that video
I'd watch it I'm too young and I don't
even know what those things are
turbo graphics 16 so Nintendo the
original Nintendo and the NES yes I'm
like familiar with that f1 you know in
the US and gosh something like that yeah
but that was an 8-bit system uh-huh so
after it was out for a few years and it
sort of proved that there was a pretty
big market for a home console like it
did really well is very successful these
successor consoles kind of the beginning
of the whole console procedure of like
new consoles coming out every every year
or every couple couple years and trying
to maintain you know establish dominance
and all that kind of thing yeah
the second generations are the
generation of stuffs that came out after
the Nintendo was all 16-bit okay so
turbo graphics 16 16-bit a 16-bit
console that came out after Nintendo was
it by a company called turbo graphics or
was yeah I don't know much about the
original company all I know is my friend
my friend up the street had one I would
go over there he also had the first ever
CD player that I used and then he got
the know ice you get the vanilla ice
single yes he listened to Ice Ice Baby
nice
I learned ice ice baby was from a liner
notes of of that CD yeah hey write a
nice people are saying NEC really NEC
made the turbografx-16 okay let's get it
on I didn't know that
and more you know if chad has to believe
it's twitch chat is to believed and they
usually pretty on on the ball you see me
all right
duper graphic sixteen there it is it is
anyway alright with a long answer to
this that would be kind of cool but I
don't know how you would do it I guess
this is really the final incident right
Thank You wishbone drew card Picard five
dollars I am now more hyped for the HTTP
see now that I know it will be a man vs
bug Bell Royale man vs. a bug a lot more
hyped up them it's like like it would
actually be but yeah you know I'll try
to embrace that yeah you can use that
why that there aliens or something this
world
Jason Kristoff $9.99 happy birthday cell
Paul wins your comic-con vids and Kyle
nice glasses
thank you Jason my comic-con vid should
go up tomorrow
Kyle's comic-con vid is already up on a
float plane tears and then our videos I
think you're gonna overlap a decent
amount so um yes yeah mine mine should
go up tomorrow did you edit yours
already
Joe edited mine no you let Joe edit your
vlogs
I always added my vlog as myself cuz I
feel like they're so personal like what
if I like flash my dick in one of them
in one of the shots you know um then Joe
or whoever's editing for me you just saw
me do I don't I don't know how I would
have had time to do everything I've done
between when we got home on Sunday and
now without having Joe edit yeah like I
just yeah I know it wasted my entire
yesterday that piece of crap yeah you
see it was a good blog it's good luck
they're both don't you get out great
block okay loggy loggy
you know cue Zenon Zenon Zenon ook $5 hi
Paul greetings from Trinidad oh my god
I'll go that's so I feel like you must
be listening to like are those real
places Trinidad and Tobago zuv their
islands it's an island yeah if internet
there I'm just I'm just persuading it's
like it's a popular vacation destination
like a like like a lychee or Hawaii or
something like that like like go Google
Image Search trinidad and tobago right
now just and tell me and tell me you
tell me you wouldn't rather be there
right now than here
wait it's it's two islands that's like
the name honestly I don't know I've
always been somewhat confused by the
name Trinidad and Tobago cuz it's it's
like two names is it more than one
island right then why not just say one
of the other where you're at
I'm in Tobago alright two islands that's
the same day like country they're like
like the Cayman Islands it's multiple
islands one one didn't she central
government he called the Trinidad
I don't know the countries the countries
the name of two two islands yes why
don't we call it like the Hawaiian
Islands or like the Hawaii Hawaii it's
just like Hawaii in Oahu
um what Hawaii and Maui Hawaii madlenka
what five or six or seven plus Hawaiian
Islands exactly it's them all off
exactly you don't call it Hawaii Maui
and just call it the Trinidad's
the Trinidad's yeah that sounds way
better Trinidad and Tobago doesn't make
any sense
I mean they like Mary citizens of Tobago
would be pretty pissed off by that
Tobago is it the big oh oh now we can't
pronounce it great
first of all we don't think it makes
sense now we don't even gotta say in
turn is a DIN toboggan okay alright okay
is actually question his actual question
oh yeah I have to use a VPN to send this
what okay see I knew the procedure your
willingness to go through that I was
right I would like to thank you for your
guidance and building my new gaming PC
you're very welcome
thank you for saying thank you thank you
for the donation I apologize if we have
offended you or any of the other
citizens of your fine country
I know and
our complete lack of knowledge Sebago

with some I usually hear in the end the
Olympics Trinidad in tobacco

retro game God five dollars your show is
my favorite look forward to it every
week thank you for all you guys do
thank you retro game Adam thank you for
making all those awesome retro games I
didn't realize there was a god that we
could thank for that but now I know
should we give you an afraid of the
guide of retro games
Fiona I mean hey we've it's it's kind of
a theme for this this little bit here
we've been talking about turbografx-16
and stuff sounds like gods no no the
retro yes thank you retro game good
nathan party $5 would you guys drink a
homebrew and if so what's your
preference
well Nathan alright uh yeah I think the
homebrew assuming that you would
definitely poison it and and it would
just like dude are dying don't put any
poison in there that's fine yeah yeah
just no poison is the only way or
laxatives that would be that would suck
to mainly poison though it'll look I
don't wanna die or have diarrhea like I
feel like there's a ninety nine point
eight percent chance that anything that
shows up and we drink and be like you
know home-brewed delicious whatever but
there's that little chance that somebody
sends us something that like gets us
both pregnant or something like I don't
know how that works it's like if you
ever want trick-or-treating nowadays and
someone handed you like here's a slice
of a macaroni casserole that I just made
like would you eat that just
something that some random person made
themselves with their own hands like a
three cheese macaroni kesav like we're
talking about only two cheese no
obviously that and it was like the
psyche they dated and they didn't put
the thought into it to get a third and
not like these creamy Velveeta cheese
just like shitty Kraft
oh you're not really selling it and
they used water instant okay yeah they
used water instead of milk so it wasn't
even like super creamy it was like kind
of watery this answers still no then so
if they did use milk and it was creamy
and it was three cheese's you'd take the
risk I mean I'd like taste it you know
you have to see if it's good the taste
it could could inevitably kill you that
could be enough poison you would
probably taste the part didn't have the
poison in it they mix that's not how it
works
that's your misunderstanding how cooking
works fundamentally and all that shit's
mixed together not necessarily maybe
they added the poison after it was all
cooked it's like one specific like
there's a one macaroni full of poison
it's like if you chopped off some
designs you could eat the interests of
the boys I give you chopped off some
Caesars cans and his blood three cheese
it's my split if my blood got all over
you and I was like sorry I have AIDS and
you were like no it's okay or if you're
like oh no Kyle has AIDS and I'm like no
it's fine because the AIDS is only in
this part of my blood the same thing
same thing remotely the same no it is
the same like this I only have AIDS my
feet only my the feet in my blood the
blood in my feet have AIDS but you know
the rest of it hasn't but I am making
perfect sense okay where did aids come
from though there was a metaphor about
three-cheese man it was a metaphor for
mac and cheese which was a metaphor for
the beer but he's gonna suffer the beer
is the AIDS which is also the mac and
cheese it's like the tricks the Holy
Trinity and and toboggan happy birthday
so happy birthday snow we love you okay
we move on so Thank You Nathan
