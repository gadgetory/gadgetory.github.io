hello everyone I've decided to do kind
of a quick impromptu vlog for today and
the reason for that is right over there
the reason it's not my Panasonic image
app for my lx100 even though that is
pretty sweet whoo crazy all right now
the reason is this this box right here
see this box this box came all the way
from Slovenia and inside is delicious
wonderful fantastical goodness from ek
but the problem is I really can't even
touch that today I can't because because
I have other things to do that's the
problem
by the way this video is brought to you
by the Pulsar Burnett pulsar Burnett the
doorway to the pulse hardware store
where you can buy shirts just like this
one anyway moving on the other reason I
might do a vlog is to show you a video
of nori say hi to the camera
no she's coy she's shy she's petulant
over here though I have yet another
project going I kind of started this off
last night although I still have much
more to do I have two systems I'm
working on the first one is a little
nook right there I'm gonna put that out
in the garage to help operate the
teleprompter and also to handle a couple
of the video screens out there other
than that I also have this system over
here this is formerly my wife's system
before the the system that she has right
now we handed this one down to her
father who has been using it it has a
Asus p5 nd motherboard and a Core 2 Duo
in there it's still very nice little
system and it was also running an SSD
which made it pretty decently fast the
thing about it though is that the point
of failure which yes was the SSD can you
guess which 100 cc vertex - still doing
damage to this day I probably shouldn't
have trusted it for as long as I did
anyway that's getting replaced with
another new SSD but I need to this is
dusty need to reinstall windows 7 on
that I got that going and
it up and then once those are finished I
also have this little guy to work on
which is the giveaway system the the
silent build I just need to do a refresh
of the operating system and a clean and
depending on when you watch this video
the the giveaway is either almost over
you might still be able to enter or it's
probably just about over so check my
Twitter I'm sure I'll be announcing the
winner but even all that is just
distraction know I have a larger duty to
take care of and what know that that
came out totally wrong so in here we've
got part of the solution to the problem
which I haven't told you what it is yet
this is a tp-link gigabit switch right
switches be trippin ok so there's a port
a port gigabit switch that's going to be
the center of my garage network or at
least my wired garage network and I've
got this awesome
length of a hundred feet of cat6 cable
this is from monoprice that was only
like 14 bucks 100 feet of it nice deal I
was gonna buy a spool but that was just
a good deal so I went for that anyway
the internet comes in over here and my
routers right here and I've been running
a cable all the way across the floor
here out to the garage and my wife's not
too keen on that but I do need wired
network in the garage I've decided so
I'm afraid for the next step though
because the only way to get it out to
the garage just go up into the attic I'm
gonna start from down here and good
stool this is good lord
oh hello the nearest hangman are and
zabrze heck's Illidan do you think we
ready for the cat 6 cable you are not
prepared hey here's my point of entry
I might need to widen that a little bit
by special widening scissors these are
approved for this type of work because
they were closer than going on to the
garage for a real tool it's just just
the tip all that it's almost oh oh you
get it right okay
Chris you gotta have a proper headgear
for this type of excursion I think do
you think the red
wish me luck nari she loves the camera
doesn't she all right so we got plenty
of cable lengths going on down here
lots of cat6 - all right latter time
that's like another world up here was
really it was really stupid of me
actually was it's it's like almost noon
now and I really should have done this
at about like 8:00 a.m. because it's
already getting really warm up here
ah as you can see the benefit of the
bright orange cable here very very easy
to spot so so I pull it up here and then
the garage is down there at the other
end then I got a I got dad just got a
poke it through never tried to navigate
the Attic with a camera before Oh lovely
cobwebs all right
they say that drywall there is the
garage
ah that's daylight I see daylight there
we go oh okay they have a little sway I
think I got the cable mostly good to go
it's coming through down there and then
comes down right out here I'm going to
run this back I end all this stuff and
it will plug into the router this is
also why it's nice to have different
colored ethernet cables tell what's
going where this router by the way is an
asus RT and five six you by the way
and yes the firmware is updated
meanwhile out in the garage
oh okay so here's the set and whatnot
and cluttered as usual but back here the
inside of the garage has finished
drywalled and insulated but I'm still
not totally clean as you can probably
see but I here's where the cable came
through and I could just run this across
the floor since I do that plenty
cable down here and they have more that
I pushed up into the attic but I think
what I'm gonna do is a temporary
solution to go across top of the wall
here
I think we are nearly finished with
today's or at least this little project
so I have the cable kind of looped up up
there and please ignore how I have my my
light mounted that's totally
professional and totally up to standards
oh oh hello EVGA x99 classified it's so
boisterous when it boots up I look
there's me and my mana price 4k monitor
it's very glossy okay but um on the show
cables coming down right here
got the switch all set up and and I
guess I can just start plugging things
in oh okay you know the lights so we
have a light that's good good sign and
then oh I have a little I got a little
shorty cable here to actually connect
the test bed and make sure that's
working all right we got lights going on
everywhere it looks like we have
internet no tada I don't know yes
connected doop to do hey we have
internet it is connected look there's my
channel alright now if I was uh if I had
nothing better to do I would totally go
and start unboxing that water clean
stuff but I should probably edit this
video and get it up so you guys can
actually see it in some sort of timely
fashion
I'm probably also gonna wrap reroute
that orange cable but stay tuned because
coming up next time on Paul's hardware
I'm going to be continuing on my epic
build right here which doesn't look much
different from last time you saw it but
I have that water cooling stuff so I'm
gonna go over the water cooling stuff
I'm actually gonna at least maybe drop
in those radiators and kind of see how
things are lining up to plan out the
tubing pathway and stuff my tempered
glass piece is on its way so there's
also going to be a mod project on the
side panel and lots of other exciting
things too so thank you for watching
today's random vlog video I hope you
enjoyed it and maybe learned a little
bit about climbing through your attic to
plug in cables and extend your network I
could have probably gone with like some
kind of power line solution but I I just
I can't I just totally prefer the wired
category five over now category six
solution but don't forget to like this
video don't forget to subscribe so you
can see all those videos I was mentioned
and head over to my website or my store
check that out I've got some t-shirts
there for sale you can buy those or you

video's description and you can buy
stuff through that and that also helps
