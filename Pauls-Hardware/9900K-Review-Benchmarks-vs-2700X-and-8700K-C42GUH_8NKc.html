description for more what's up guys
hello and welcome to my launch review
video on Intel's newest CPU the core
high 990 900k the CPU has been up for
presale for about a week and a half
already but aside from some dubious
numbers that were posted by principal
technologies independent reviews such as
mine today haven't been able to weigh in
TL DR though this cpu is clearly the
fastest one that you can buy for gaming
performance right now it is also no
slouch when it comes to compute
intensive tasks either and that is
thanks to it being the first eight core
16 thread CPU available on intel's
mainstream platform socket LGA 1151 and
of course we got these new motherboards
to go along with it with the zi 390
chipset I am sure this is going to
become the go-to CPU for the highest end
gaming systems that people put together
for the next few months at least but on
the flip side it is selling for five
hundred and thirty dollars and up and
AMD has a very compelling and much more
cost-effective option to the 99 hundred
K in their 2700 X which also sports
eight cores and sixteen threads and can
be purchased today with no waiting on
back orders or anything like that for
three hundred and five dollars at least
as of the prices I looked at earlier but
answering the most important questions
about the 99 hundred K is my goal today
so here's how I'm going to arrange
things first we got some benchmarks of
course where I will compare the eight
core eleven thread ninety-nine hundred K
to the six core twelve thread eighty
seven hundred K which costs three
hundred seventy dollars right now and is
also a coffee leak 14 nanometer + + +
base CPU it's just got one less + than
9900 K and then of course the best
mainstream CPU that AMD has to offer the
8 core 16 thread rise in 720 700 X which
is based on the 12 nanometers n +
architecture second I will be answering
the important question of which
processor is the fastest both for gaming
and for CPU compute work and finally I
will talk value because that is a very
important part of choosing B twist these
processors before anything else till I
ran all these benchmarks within the past
48 hours or so so let's take a look at
my test bed at configurations now the
graphics card is one of the important
parts here and I wanted to maintain
consistency across all testing platforms
so for the graphics card i have a gtx
1080 TI i didn't want to throw in the 20
80 or 20 80 TI quite yet this is the 11g
version though not the zero 11g of the
asus strix GTX 10 80 TI which is an
aftermarket design with a custom PCB
basically this is an overclock as much
as the O version so the frequencies are
1493 base clock 1607 boost 1895 for the
maximum frequency and then on average it
was hitting about 1820 for a CPU cooler
I have a 240 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cool that's the cooler master
master liquid ML 240 R and then for a
thermal paste in case you're wondering
I'm using the Arctic mx4 which is a very
popular paste my 8700 K is still running
on this little tiny motherboard which is
an asus strix Z 370 - I gaming it is a
mini ITX motherboard but I'm only
running the CPUs at stock frequencies
for my tests today so I wasn't too
concerned about power delivery for
memory for all the systems I'm using the
exact same kit which is a G scale flare
X kit just designed for AMD but also
works just fine for Intel ddr4 3200 cast
latency 14 and I'm using the XMP
settings for all of the configurations
for the 9900 K to max frequency is going
to be 5 gigahertz on a single core and
then it will ramp it down from that
depending on how many cores are being
used and the Maximus 11 hero was a nice
solid motherboard for the testing and
finally for our AMD testbed we have
another asus motherboard this is the
Asus crosshair 7 hero another rog board
that's got the x4 70 chipset same memory
kits and again just XMP settings other
than that everything's running at stock
and now let's check out some benchmarks
starting off with Cinebench this is the
multi thread test and remember of course
the eight core 16 thread CPUs are gonna
have an advantage in multi-threaded
tests the 9900 K scored over 2,000
points 24 T with a 2,700 X coming in
about 11 or 12 percent behind with score
of 1805 moving over to the single
threaded test and this is where the 8700
K previously and now the 9900 K have had
an advantage even more of a single core
advantage now for the 9900 K thanks to
that 5 gigahertz single core clock speed
8700 K is gonna max out at 4 points
gigahertz on a single core at stock and
then the 2700 X will go up to four point
two to four point three five gigahertz
on one or two cores with X at bar 2.0
ultimately though the 2,700 X is still
about 19% behind here for CPU mark
overall score for the 9900 K of 20,000
394 which beats out the 2,700 X by about
2500 points or about 14% and if we move
over to the single-threaded test we can
see the 9900 K breaking 3000 with a
score of 3000 24 and here coming in at a
little over 25 percent faster
single-threaded than the 2700 X next up
is blender this is the fishy cat render
and here the 8700 K in 2700 X pretty
much Thai with pretty much equivalent
scores and that puts them both about 23%
behind the 9900 K score of 23 points
remember lower is better here this is
time in seconds here's another blender
test the BMW 27 test which takes a bit
longer the 9900 case still had an
impressive score of 216 overall seconds
8700 K came in last year with the lower
core and thread count that eventually
will lead to lower scores so the 2,700 X
surpassed it it's still about 20% behind
the 9900 K whereas the 8700 K was about
30% behind
here's my final CPU compute test for
this round this is pov-ray which is a
simulated ray tracing software although
not a not available with RT X on yet and
here the 9900 K wins again with a time
of sixty point three seconds 2,700 X
comes in second with seventy one point
nine seconds or about 16% behind and
then the 8700 K trailing in last place
with 91 point eight seconds and that is
about 35% behind the 9900 K let's move
into some gaming tests although 3d mark
is kind of a hybrid test because we have
an overall score that combines multiple
tests graphics as well as physics so
physics score here is the CPU compute
performance graphics will show you how
well the graphics card is performing
when paired with the specific CPU and
remember there's all the same graphics
card we're seeing here here the graphics
tests are pretty much the same the 2700
X is trailing but it's really only by a
negligible amount but we do see a big
advantage for the 9900 K in the physics
test scoring just shy of 25,000 points
whereas the 2,700 X comes in with 20,000
681 and next we have 3d mark times pi
which is a DirectX
test here again the overall scores are
pretty much similar to each other
they're all within a couple percentage
points graphics score the 8700 K and
2,700 X actually did a little bit better
than the 9900 K although again just a
couple percentage points so that's
pretty much negligible CPU score was
well over 10,000 actually just shy of
11,000 for the 9900 K and 8880 for the
2700 X so it wins there yet again moving
on to an actual game this is rice at the
Tomb Raider directx12 mode and Here I am
testing at 1920 by 1080 I want to point
out that I'm running these game tests at
1920 by 1080 specifically because that
will actually take less of a strain off
of the GPU and put it onto the CPU that
will tease out differences between the
CPU but you should also bear in mind
that if you're using a 9900 Kay you're
probably not going to be gaming at 1080
maybe you will but most people are going
to be gaming at high resolutions in that
and it's very important to keep in mind
if you're just looking at the gaming
scenario and you're gonna be playing at
1440 or 4k you won't see differences in
your gaming performance like we're
seeing here that said though for as the
Tomb Raider though we can definitely see
performance improvement that is gained
by pairing the GPU with the 9900 K or
the 8700 K for that matter so in this
test specifically the single core
performance of both of those chips is
allowing the GPU to outperform what the
2,700 X is capable of we actually see a
much lower score of hundred and twenty
five point nine frames per second versus
the hundred and sixty frames per second
or so of the 8700 K and 9900 K that's
about a 20% drop off but again this is a
specific scenario that is teasing out
more of a difference between the
performance of the GPUs that we would
normally see at high resolutions as you
can see on our next game ashes of the
singularity escalation also at 1920 by
1080 the margin is much much slimmer
actually drops down to about 2.8 percent
I with 2,700 X scoring eighty two point
eight average frames per second than the
99 hundred K coming in with 85 points
ooh again here the 8700 K is actually
outperforming the 99 hundred K so this
makes a point of if you don't need the
extra cores for the 99 hundred K then
maybe even the 8700 K might be a nice
sort of split the difference between
what you get with the 2,700 X and the 99
hundred K when it comes to terms of
price one more game test here though and
that is GTA 5 this is also running at
1920 by 1080 and here the 9900 K does
the best with a score of hundred and
sixty-four we can even see
performing the 8700 k GTA 5 is a pretty
well optimized game 2700 X is also
scoring less here hundred and
thirty-five frames per second that
brings in at about seventeen point seven
percent slower than the 99 hundred K
still a decent drop-off here but again
this is a scenario that is specifically
designed to show differences in
performance when it comes to games and
if you're to play the same games high
resolutions you wouldn't see a
performance difference like this so now
let's move to the second question which
is basically going to be can we sum up
these performance tests and give a more
direct answer of which CPU is faster in
which situation first off the CPU
performance tests and here I'm taking
all of my CPU performance tests blender
and so forth as well as the physics
tests from 3dmark then I'm taking all
those numbers and doing math on them to
give you guys a summation of the
performance difference the 9900 K is the
fastest in these tests so that's
representing either percent of the
performance and the 2,700 X comes in
about 18.4% to slower than that's where
as the 8700 K comes in about twenty two
point seven percent slower than that so
you can see the gradual drop-off or
somewhat gradual drop off when it comes
to CPU compute performance if I take
just my gaming tests and again let me
point out this is worst-case scenario
gaming test because I'm mainly focusing
on 1080 performance even with that taken
into consideration we're about 11
percent behind the 9900 K with the 2,700
X 8700 K did much better here and here
we're only about 2.5 percent behind
so again if your main focus is gaming
the 8700 K might be a better or more
economical choice for you than the 9900
K of course if the CPU compute stuff
makes more difference to you if you're
gonna actually do some video editing or
something like that then the 9900 K
makes a little bit more sense but it's
not just about performance and the third
thing we got to figure out is value and
for that of course we got to check out
the prices of these I've already
mentioned them but just to reiterate the
9900 K currently pre sailing on Amazon
for five hundred and thirty bucks new he
has it for 580 bucks because they're
stupid I don't know why anyone would buy
it for $50 more when it's clearly
available at Amazon that said 8700 K
right now is 370 and the 2700 X can be
had for 305 that means that compared to
the 2700 X's price you're paying a 21%
more for the 87 order K for about five
or six percent less performance
it comes to the CPU side you're paying
seventy three point eight percent more
for about twenty two percent more
performance so that's pretty decent gap
there as well and then when it comes to
graphics performance you're paying again
seventy three point eight percent more
for the ninety nine hundred K for twelve
point three percent more performance or
twenty one percent more performance for
the 87 or DK for nine point five percent
more performance so to kind of sum
things up the ninety nine hundred K is a
monstrously powerful CPU for someone who
wants no compromises in a mixed use
system it's got the best gaming
performance you could want and it's got
a lot of CPU compute horsepower - that's
all in a ninety five watt TDP package
that can slot into teeny tiny mini ITX
boards which is also very nice
much like the recently launched RT X xx
atti though you must pay a price premium
for this level of performance and that
might not be justifiable given the very
viable 2700 X option it's also worth
noting that I can't currently speak to
the core i7 9700 K or Core i5 9600 K
performance and values yet as those are
six and eight core CPUs that are not
hyper threaded and they weren't sampled
to press yet as far as I know so we'll
have to wait and see on those but if
you've got the money and you want the
best and spending over $500 on a CPU
doesn't faze you I can safely recommend
the you 9900 K if you're on a budget at
all though you could not pay 70 percent
more for the 99 hundred K and instead
settle for about 20 percent less CPU
compute performance and at the very
worst about 10 percent fewer frames per
second in your games that's only if
you're playing 1080 and in that case the
2700 X is definitely gonna be the better
bet that's all for this video though
guys thank you so much for watching I
hope you enjoyed it hit the thumbs up
button if you did and of course leave me
comments in the comment section to let
me know if you're gonna buy the 99
hundred K or wait for next year wait for
Canon Laker now where the heck's 10
nanometre anyway I'm getting distracted
oh thanks for watching guys we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
