am doing a vlog today so I don't really
have like a specific topic today's video
is going to be a little bit random but
I'm kind of an in-between time I just
got back from Computex about a week and
a half ago
fortunately I'm mostly over the jetlag
so that's good
but as you might be able to see behind
me my house is pretty much in chaos that
is the results of being gone for a while
and also the influx of parts that
coincides with a new product launch so
intel is launching their X 299 LGA 2066
platform soon for so this bunch of new
motherboards to go along with the new
intel core x-series processors I am
testing one of those so far that
actually I got from gigabyte they sent
me a 77 40 X actually they handed that
off to me I was able to go and stop by
their offices and get that from them so
that's the only reason I'm actually up
and running right now I'm actually still
waiting for the sample to come in from
in sell which is going to be hopefully
at 7,900 X so I want to get some testing
done on that as well and I don't have
very much time so today I'm just going
to take you guys through my day I'll
pick up the camera from time to time and
show you what I'm up to
apart from continuing the benchmarks out
here it's really hot so that's why in
benchmarking out here because the garage
is going to give a lot warmer as the day
goes on but I'm also going to try to get
some stuff done out there then the board
I used to get up and running yesterday
it's the gigabytes
Oris X $2.99 horas gaming 7 which you
might have seen me cover briefly in my
Computex coverage but this is what you
got to do when you're in a rush to get a
test bed up and running and you just
take everything else that was on the
table push it to the side set up a
monitor and then just kind of get things
going so the motherboard of course down
at the bottom you might notice I have a
KB Lake X CPU in there so that's why the
memory is only populated on one side
they got a g.skill trade and some memory
kit right there still not sure what
speed I'm going to run that at for this
processor since it's sort of an odd one
that's the one that only has four cores
eight threads it's basically like a 7700
K that they poured it over to this
platform it's supposed to be a pretty
good overclocker though so I think I
might see what it can do to get that
overclocked
can't share any performance numbers with
you guys in this video but I will of
course have full coverage of this launch
when I am able to share that apart from
that I got an EVGA 750g 3G power supply
drop that in there that compared
everything I'm just rolling with 1080p
is for the GPUs at least for my initial
testing and everything so there's the
asus strix
1080p i doing a great job and then for
cooling right now I'm starting off with
air cooling but I'm probably gonna
switch to liquid coolers or some all in
ones as I move on and this is the enter
max ETS T 40 in black and I paired that
with my scythe gentle typhoon fan which
does a really good job at this point I
have Windows installed and up and
running and updated I still need to work
on getting some driver updates in there
and making sure that all is all good to
go
and then I'm also told by gigabyte they
have another new BIOS version since
those are coming pretty quick I also
have this X $2.99 motherboard from Asus
the prime X 299 luxe again another
motherboard that I took a brief look at
over and my copy text coverage cool to
have it in the retail box here again and
if my 7900 X comes in if I'm going to
drop it into this one and get that up
and running as well this MSI group is
actually the first one that arrived to
me this is their X 299 gaming Pro carbon
AC the sent me this kits of replacement
plates on it that have my poles Hardware
text on there which is pretty cool
however the motherboard they originally
said they had to recall and bring back
this is that too uncommon when it comes
to new product launches but they shipped
me this one that just arrived as well
and I think they had to ship it straight
from the factory this came from Taiwan
so I haven't opened that yet but maybe I
should that be fun
now out here in my garage as the thing
goes I have more chaos going on because
again I just say I constantly need to
clean everything but there is the
ultimate streaming and capture system at
leas previously the ultimate streaming
and capture system in public knew
launched happen to kinetic to DX in
there check out the video on that build
and the initial testing if you want to
but goals here for today are going to be
to take that system bring it over there
drop it into the corner maybe try to get
some of these cables cleaned up that
would be nice I be getting lots of flack
for my cable management situation like
up here and that's totally totally
warranted I'll tell this this is I was
doing some work on a change their shower
heads I don't know why these are even
here look here's your swagg that I get
from coputex I can share that with you
guys really quick there Bauer I got to
hang out with him and a little bit and
that was pretty cool he actually gave me
one of his deleting tools although it
came with an allen wrench and apparently
the allen wrench was too thick was too
large to get through TSA and they took
it away from me but I do have the
deleting tool in there this is for LGA
like 1150 CPUs 151 CPUs like 7700 K 6600
K that kind of thing so I definitely
want to try that out I really have not
done much deal living before and this
tool makes it a lot safer than it would
be otherwise so thanks to bar for
sending that over we did get a chance to
go by the Gwang ha digital Plaza which I
always like to stop by
got me some cr2025 full replacements
like bios batteries I'm I'm kind of
unreasonably excited about these I'm not
sure why but and then hey another thing
I sort of unreasonably excited about is
these two things right here okay so this
one here all it is is a short USB 3
extension why the heck would I be
excited about that I'm excited about
this because I have laptops that have
USB ports that are too close together I
also have like cases the double USB
ports are too close together I'm always
like man if I just had a short extension
I can make use of all the plugs so dad
this was about two bucks and I again got
unreasonably excited about it
this one though this one's a lot more
practical if you watch my video where I
kind of lost my HDMI out on my gh4 I now
have a gh 5 and this is going to be my
port saver it's just a really tiny USB
I'm sorry HDMI
cable extension and I'm going to
implement it right now just going to
plug the one side in okay it sit in
there pretty snugly but I got in there
so one side goes in here into the camera
and then I can take my other end here
and then plug in if I want to do HDMI
has to go over to the capture system or
whatever some unplugging and re-plugging
in this many times over and not wearing
out the actual plug on the camera itself
so really glad to have that and again
that was only like a couple bucks in
Taiwan that you can get those here too
and they're not terribly expensive and
have ones that like lock in better for
you and everything but this should do
just fine for me especially since the gh
5 also comes with this little little
cable walker thingy which I clearly
don't not easy sorry to any
cinematographers out there by the way
I'm using like all automatic settings
for this video but here's the final
thing that I came back with which I'm
also prettiest I've done this is just a
fan the USB fan just got clipped then
that's not the best clip but it can clip
on to things so you can attach it
wherever you might want to this also
apparently made by Lee Ann Lee then it's
USB powered so well usb on that end
route it over here to something like a
power bank and power bank has a to that
doubt I don't know what that's going to
do as running this off of a just
straight out of the USB front panel
connector on the on the streaming system
over there during the live stream if you
notice be portable you know get a power
bank or otherwise you could just plug it
into a laptop or something like that and
ever that on ooh it's possible that for
the rest of the awesome hardware live
shows for the summer I will just have
this pointed at my face active cooling
hello there big boy
say I'm trying to get work done and he
just kind of pokes his head in like this
it's a good boy he got a walk this
morning so he's in a good mood alright
so I did tweet about this too I really
just thought this was sort of a strange
issue and a weird thing since this is
pretty much a clean Windows installation
to happen and pop up probably not the
best experience for like the first time
user or something like that I'm very
aware like there's things I could have
done I mean
restarting killing it with task manager
that kind of thing but the most
interesting fix that I saw on Twitter
was just to go in and actually change
the the scaling so I change it was set
at 100% normal I switch to 125 and then
I switch back to 100 and that gave me
the full display
thank you for updating to the latest
version of Windows 10 and now I can
click exit
you
thinking I could probably use a shave
Mary's yearning out hold on Wow Wow X I
can plug this in dogs barking that dices
oh just give you your stuff today it's
Kyle
hey we're here definitely and you're
here to track your places like Walmart
yeah
are you cool if I shove a camera in your
face right when you're right I guess
that's the price of admission it is it
is for today totally forgot to mention
that my operating systems on an OC z rd
400 bit so Kylie you've also received a
CE o how can you cut me no likey you got
a CPU from gigabyte too right yes the
same as you I think somebody's Minds
delivered yeah why is yours deleted I
don't know at first I'm like should I be
excited or not about that and of course
what's your what's your opinion so far
of this platform are you excited
I don't know I feel like if I had a real
opinion I probably would have made like
a sketch comedy video about it or
something but that was where you had
your deal with your deleted sepia that
must have changed your opinions entirely
but I feel like after I go live with my
kV like expert view on Monday everyone's
just going to be like he got he doesn't
want to sell out you know there was a
sketch like bashing them being all
savage now he's like totally in Intel's
pocket cetera like I'm going on back to
Intel shell like just like that because
it did a video on it I got to do
something with all that money they make
from the game that's true it is a like
four four one three for twenty we're
going 8-4 with this focus not very
talented it is actually for 29th we
should probably go and do that when she
doesn't get okay because people seem to
think that we're like upset at each
other and that there's like bitterness
alright so I first off I think we just
want to point out that we in no way
are here to drum up controversy but if
you guys want to argue about that and
what we're here for in the comments
please feel free to go hahaha alright
guys Kyle and Heather just took off we
had a wonderful time guests appearing on
the wine show we argued our points when
it comes to us winning scrap yard words
versus Linus and Luke I think we had a
lot of people who sympathize with us but
I cannot help but be a little bit
disappointed I still do not have that
7900 X processor that Intel was supposed
to be sending my way so I don't know
what's going to happen fortunately I
have these 77 40 X that gigabyte
provided so I can at least do some work
on that
who knows maybe it will still show up
today or maybe even tomorrow but I would
be working on weekends testing this out
giving you guys some coverage on that
and of course hopefully if it doesn't
arrive in time for the embargo list I
will at least be able to give you some
more content coming up on that next week
but of course it's thumbs up button if
you enjoyed this video subscribe if
you're not already for more content from
my channel thank you so much for
watching guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
