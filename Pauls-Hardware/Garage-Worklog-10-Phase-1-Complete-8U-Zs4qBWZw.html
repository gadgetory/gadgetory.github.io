to the final garage work log of 2015 and
my goals for this whole project behind
me has just been to get a much better
sense of organization to set up a better
workflow for my progress or just for my
procedures for making videos so that
that's all kind of sorted out and also
to really make it easier to clean and
that's a pretty basic thing but just to
get stuff up off the ground too so I can
get back in behind stuff and clean it
out because I am in a garage and it does
get dusty out here and I need to I need
to keep it clean pretty often now if you
can't garage work vlog number 9 you know
that I have been painting if you can see
behind me right now you might notice
that I've already started to put up some
of those shelves I'm gonna be continuing
that today and hopefully getting to a
point where I'm like almost done I don't
think dad I'm never gonna really be done
but done with the stuff I wanted to get
done for this year and that's good cuz
here's just about over anyway let me
show you what I got going on for today's
video so two of the shelves in I've got
two more to go those are gonna go over
along this wall at pretty much the same
exact height that those two are the
brackets I used for these and actually I
got some comments in the video I did I
posted last week which was that I could
rotate them which I actually did for the
top one so that the top shelf is
actually a little bit closer to the wall
than the lower shelf and a lower shelf
is actually spaced out so sorry I'm
knocking things over
Laure shelf is actually spaced out a bit
so that I can do stuff like passing
wires back behind it if I need to and
also and I've kind of just set it up so
I could see what it looked like I have
some LEDs so I'm gonna do probably a
strip of LEDs behind this shelf just for
some accent lighting on the wall and
I'll probably go down this side as well
not going to do that for the top though
cuz I don't I think that might be
overkill and I don't think I have that
many LEDs either I do have some sound
dampening foam that I picked up and
these I'm actually gonna be putting in
right underneath this panel all along
here and then probably along this wall
as well that should put it roughly at
the same height as the mics so that it
should kill some of that mounts I am was
considering doing it above here as well
but I hopefully won't need to do that
once there's stuff on the shelves that
should hopefully kill
they know he's bounced as well I already
did my Home Depot trip this morning I
was in a rush so I didn't grab the
camera to vlog it but um I needed more
of these brackets I ran out of spray
paint yesterday here last night's so
this one isn't quite finished so I had
to get some more paint I also got some
standard paints so I can actually do
some touch-ups because even the paint
that I've applied properly with spray
paint is it's cheap it's chipping and
dinging pretty easily so I'm gonna need
to do some touch-ups I also want to
paint over the the screw caps and
everything so that it's all in even
color and I went to get more of those
white brackets but they didn't have them
so I got these which are kind of the I
don't know they're not black but they're
dark finish anyway hopefully it won't
look too different get some this lovely
3m general-purpose adhesive maybe you
can read and that's gonna be used for
installing these sound dampening foam
bits and those are all gonna go over
there as already mentioned anyway though
this is already probably way too much
exposition and introduction for this
video so let's just get to it and
hopefully when I come back I will be
saying look it is all completed let's
start off with last night and the
installation of those shelves right up
there
so these are gonna be my socket covers
this sides gonna face the wall these
four pieces I'm gonna drill on like here
and here so they'll face it up from the
wall and hopefully I'm just gonna hook
it on and hold it in place so I can
remove it and get behind there if
necessary and I hope this works because
they're just gonna made it up off the
top of my head
hey everyone and welcome back I'm here
with nori
who is very tired because it is now the
day after Christmas it's the 26th and we
actually had a ton of people over
yesterday we had about 30 people so yeah
first off I'm sorry if my work logged
thus far got a little bit cut off
because I ran into a little bit of a
time crunch and I pretty much had to
like wrap things up really quickly so I
didn't film a lot of the reorganisation
of moving stuff back in but let me show
you where I match because I'm pretty
much at the end of this phase the phase
1 or whatever I'm calling it for 2015
done for the year I stuff more stuff to
do next year of course but that's all
coming in the future but I wanted to
start off with actually what you're
hopefully able to see right now which is
look the living room oh my goodness it
is clean all that stuff is gone we had
like I said 30 people over here
yesterday and everything went went
swimmingly everything was fine everyone
said the tree was pretty and all that
good stuff
so yeah it's fabulous to have this area
open again my wife is also very happy so
that's really cool over here we have our
party gear that we just packed up last
night chairs and tables and that kind of
thing spent a ton of time making food
and all that good stuff I despite the
rush I was able to make some spritz
cookies which I'm gonna eat one up right
now cuz they're delicious I even made
some pie do that homemade apple pie
all from scratch sometimes there's
leftovers I'm not gonna complain them
anyway let's go into the garage I make
these spritz cookies every year like
butter Christmas cookies they're
absolutely delicious so this is my work
in filming area this is what I've been
working on so diligently in my garage
work logs and I'll go over kind of how
its laid out in just a second I did want
to show the rest of the garage because
it is full of stuff now like all that
stuff that was out in the dining room is
back out here but is so much better
organized than twas before so like this
is some temporary stuff that we just
stashed in here so these are empty bins
this is like this is my e-waste file
over there this is all stuff that is
like cables it is organized so like
there's different bins over there and
all this stuff is going to be put into
the
cupboard the cupboard is in use right
now but I'm it's not being used to its
maximum potential
so even over here where there's just
piles of stuff all the empty or not
empty boxes butts retail boxes and that
kind of thing
I can still walk through so look see I
can get through over here and my
workbench this area over here is also
clear and I know it's dark over here but
this stuff is actually up on my old desk
so um there's a few cases and stuff
underneath but most of the stuff is up
off the floor also over here I still
have shelf standards and shelf pieces of
wood so I need to put in some extra
shelves here so there's more storage to
be added and everything to get stuff
organized here's a look at my big tall
storage cabinet though which has a
temporary opener I did put a little
metal piece on there so it stays closed
and yeah definitely not being used to
its full potential I just I was in a
huge rush and I was just shoving stuff
in here so it's really just kind of
piled in there I haven't organized stuff
or added any smaller shelves so there's
lots of room still in there I guess this
is my point but here's the main event
alright so these are my shelves super
super happy with how these turned out
again the brackets are fairly expensive
these are like about 4 or 5 bucks from
Home Depot each I scrape in it or I
painted them all black it's not the best
finish on there but these are my wood
shelves that I went and did a little bit
of rounded edge on with my router and
that turned out really good it's right
now again this isn't like permanent
stuff that's gonna be back here it's
like these are my existing video cards
that I have out for testing and stuff
these are dead closed-loop CPU coolers
for the most part I've got my test bed
over than the corner not using much up
in there up over there and then I was
piling some stuff up here that isn't
quite as presentable to have on camera
but I got like CPUs and memory and the
storage stuff there and software up on
top and and all that good stuff it is
wonderful to have just places to put
things though and as you can see this
corner over here is where all the live
streaming stuff still is so that's up
right there this light I'm still
planning to mount to the ceiling at some
points this actually was very
precariously propped up up there before
but now it's back on the floor just for
the time being then down here I have my
little ghetto teleprompter that I can
easily set up right here with my camera
when I'm getting ready to film now I
know like I said there's still stuff I
have to do I think the one thing that's
sticking out to you the most is this
right here I was editing a video um
the video I did of the Christmas build
and I was like that is not straight I
need to fix that gonna fix that soon so
I'm gonna go reposition some of this
sound dampening film that I put in back
here just held on with some adhesive and
then I have my wood cable cable
organization panels that I've kind of
put in there as well and these aren't
currently I might put something to hold
secure these on but currently they're
not held on by anything they just kind
of stay there and that they go over that
and cover up the plugs and I think it
looks much nicer than the plugs as they
were before it's also let me route
cables like up to the top for example if
they end up putting like maybe a monitor
up there or something like that here's a
couple gifts I got for Christmas
look clamps so many clamps and like the
world's smallest planer which I'm
actually kind of stoked about the
Catania that little planer is so cute
anyway though guys that's gonna wrap it
up for this video the final garage work
log of 2015 I'm glad that you guys like
these because it's really like I either
make a video about the work I'm doing in
here or I don't make videos so I'm happy
that you guys have stuck with me through
them I'm still gonna be doing some of
these I think in 2016 although not as
frequently because I don't have a major
project like I've just been working on
that I had to like clear everything out
and do painting and all that speaking of
painting I still need to go in and paint
the entire underneath section down here
so that's still on the to-do list but we
can save that for next year thank you
guys so much for watching this video hit
the like button if you enjoyed it merry
belated Christmas and Happy New Year to
all of you
hope you have a wonderful and safe
holiday and we'll see you all very soon
with some more videos and then coming up
as well in the first week of January CES
2016 and for that I'll be doing just one
or two videos on my channel and then
I'll be reporting for tech syndicate
