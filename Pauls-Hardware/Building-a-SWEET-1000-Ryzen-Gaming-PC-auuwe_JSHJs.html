what's up guys and welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is going to be my
monthly build for April 2017 this is an
Andy rising build it's going to cost you
about a thousand and fifty dollars but
you can also get it down to a thousand
bucks or even a little bit less by
swapping this 1600 X CPU and cooler for
a 1600 CPU that comes with a built-in
cooler although you might not be able to
overclock quite as well beyond that all
the parts have already been chosen and
laid out in my monthly builds video at
the beginning of every month since every
month I plan out a build and then I
build the build and then I come back and
test the build and give you guys
feedback on the actual build process and
performance so without further ado let's
go over really quickly the parts I'm
going to be using today so let's begin a
rundown of our parts with our processor
of course the rise in 5 1600 X so the X
is going to be clocked a little bit
faster than the rise in 5 1600 however
does not come with a cooler there's
nothing in here besides the CPU itself
there's a 6 core cpu with SMT enabled so
you get 12 threads which is a very nice
sort of in-between between paying a
little bit more for the horizon 7 series
and also getting yourself more cores and
more threads versus like 1400 or 1500 X
now since it doesn't come with a cooler
we're going to be using the master air
pro 4 cooler and very mine's here this
is aimed for compatible but you do need
a name for bracket so double check when
you're purchasing to make sure that it
is actually listed as and for compatible
if not you can head up cooler master and
they will send you the and for brackets
to mount to this and they'll do that
free of charge if you've purchased it
without that for motherboard we have the
Asus Prime be 350 plus and I really like
this motherboard because it's very
inexpensive reasonably so it's only
about a hundred bucks got your an for
socket four dimm slots you got like m
dot to support in a good area right up
here and it's basically going to get
blood you plug in and connect every
thing that you need it's got a soos
builds quality and you know that they do
a really good job with their boards even
looks pretty cool with a black canary
color scheme and a little bit of LED
highlighting going down the side so I
think that's going to do a fine job for
us the shortcomings of the x-series
chipsets X 370 is mainly just the lack
of two-way SLI support but honestly for
this build we're probably not going to
need that anyway although we do have an
Nvidia graphics card the geforce gtx
1070 and i'm kind of comparing this
build to the one that i did about five
or six months ago which was a $1200
build this one's about 200 bucks less
and yet it still has a gtx 1070 i'm
going with the msi one here you can pick
your flavor depending on what color
scheme you like or which one you can
find on sale this is the gaming
extraversion from msi and i already know
it's got a nice cooler on it and again
sticking with the black and red color
scheme speaking of black and red color
scheme another sort of optional item
here is going to be your SSD I mean not
optional but you can sort of choose
which one you like best and which one
suits your build this is the sandy
sculpture to which you can get in 240
gig capacity this happens to be one
terabyte one but it'll look just the
same and it'll do just the same job as
before but find yourself an SSD that's
that's one of my main requirements for
computer builds these days makes
everything faster for memory we have a
Corsair Vengeance lpx kit this kit has
been used many times before it's very
popular but it is ddr4 3000 rated which
means we should be able to hit 29:33
without any problem with our 1600 X here
and you are going to get a nice boost in
performance by going with a bit faster
memory such as 29:33 over going with the
base speeds of like 2100 or 2400 or
something like that
and of course if you do decide in the
future they want to upgrade to even
faster memory than this small memory
upgrade it's a very simple thing to do
for the case I went with the NZXT s340
this is just a very solid case this
isn't the elite Edition or anything it
doesn't have tempered glass but it comes
in at a very reasonable price only about
60 or 70 bucks again depending where you
buy it and shipping and all that kind of
stuff but a very solid case really cool
design looks nice I built in it before
so shouldn't give us any shovels finally
for the power supply I did have an EVGA
power supply listed I'm going to be
using this coolermaster v6 50 instead
it's basically just what I have on hand
right now I don't have to the Eevee
a fire splitter let's it on hand this is
going to kind of do get to get the job
done in the same way it so that all
black cabling but again depending on
what you can find in pricing you might
want to stick with that EVGA model just
a you know double check your juice do
some reality checking and make sure you
get the prices will end up so there are
the parts and now it is time let's get
this thing put together
cue the music
so I got the motherboard all set up
installation of this CPU cooler is not
too terribly difficult especially if
you've ever installed a hyper 212 before
because it's really about the same
installation method for the master air
pro 4 you do have to remove a couple of
those a m4 at the top retention brackets
they come pre-installed on the
motherboard
you just pop those off and then you use
the existing and four backplate 2:30 on
there there's just four of these little
nuts that you put on top of that to hold
the bracket in place and then you mount
the CPU cooler on top of course after
putting a little bit of thermal paste on
there to provide a nice thermal
interface between the cooler and the
actual CPU itself beyond that just
popped in the memory and then you might
notice that this motherboard is not
quite as wide as typical ATX
motherboards it's kind of the yeah this
way because it's cool but narrow that
way so rather than the nine mounting
points that we would usually have fur
motherboard actually have six two on the
top two in the middle and two at the
bottom so next up is to make sure that
the case is prepped for that put the
stand up in the right place and then
we'll get everything dropped in there
and then of course we'll move on to the
power supply getting that installed and
getting all the power hooked up
now I've got the motherboard installed
now and I've actually come across a very
interesting issue perhaps something that
you might not encounter in a lot of
builds but I already mention the size of
this motherboard being a little bit
shorter than you would typically have
for a ATX motherboard and actually since
the case has standoffs pre-installed you
might notice them kind of sticking out
at the edge of the board these these
other three on the side so there and
there as well as one and the dark which
is up here in the corner now I was
tempted at first to leave those as is
but honestly it's never ever ever a good
thing that's just best practices for
building a computer never a good thing
to have a motherboard installed where
you don't actually have a proper
mounting point where the stand-up should
be like like it is over here with the
screw that's installed so I am going to
pull the motherboard out and get rid of
these extra three standoffs push it out
here at mdft for actually putting all of
the screws into individual baggies that
are labeled like the UNC 632 these are
m3 these are stand-ups and if you're
wondering how to get to stand up out of
the case another nice thing that nd xt
is included as an actual stand off nut
right there so you can use phillips head
on one side and then the other side is
just a little hex if you have a standard
little hex kit you should be able to use
this you should be able to use that as
well but this should work just fine
alright guys the build is pretty much
done at this point and before I get to
before I put the side panels back on and
do some final closing sexy shots that I
wanted to give it a once-over and a few
notes on the actual build process
everything went pretty smoothly and as
you could probably tell the three extra
standoffs I had to remove was probably
the most confusing part I guess but
color scheme wise everything blends in
great we got a nice black and red theme
for the motherboard the case graphics
card even the SSD down there in the
bottom looking pretty good cable
management was also very easy in this
case I like the the raised cable
management bar that they have in the
NZXT s340 s you can hide stuff back
there and it makes it easy to tuck stuff
back in a way I did this time opted to
reconfigure the fanny situation that
they have going on I think when they
ship this case they set it up so that
you can easily install like a water
cooler here in the front so they put an
exhaust at the back and an exhaust at
the top I removed at the top exhaust and
just moved it up here to the front
equalize the airflow a little bit more
so you've got an intake pushing some air
in this way and then of course fans are
going to push stuff through and then the
exhaust at the back and some air can
leak at the top too if it wants to this
dust filter also will get a little bit
more use in that case and hopefully keep
the case from being too much positive
and sorry too much negative pressure
moving around to the back for kill
management's as you can see cables are
managed I did tie a few of the extra
loops that came out from the top back
here just so that they wouldn't stick
out as much like I got a zip tie there
and I said tie they're just holding
extra loops of fan cables in place took
the CPU fan I CPU power and brought it
down here along the side everything else
as far as extra cables would just pretty
much shoved back there into the basement
and then I really did minimal cable
management here I mean I put a zip side
there to kind of hold the bulk of these
cables together in place once they're
where they're supposed to be and
everything else is just a matter of kind
of routing it writing it where it should
and getting the excess tucked out of the
way so there it is so I am now going to
put the side panels and front panel back
on and
fire this up I will get Windows loading
very soon so I can do the follow up
video with some testing of the system to
show some performance as well as some
temperatures and noise and I'm going to
leave you guys with some sexy finished
shots of this build I think it looks
pretty much equivalent to the one that I
did about six months ago still looks
very sexy and it's still very reasonably
priced for a system that is as powerful
with the six core 1600 X as well as a
gtx 1070 in there the guys thank you so
much for watching this video I really
hope you enjoyed it I'll be back with
more videos very soon
so if thumbs up button and subscribe to
my channel if you wanna see more videos
