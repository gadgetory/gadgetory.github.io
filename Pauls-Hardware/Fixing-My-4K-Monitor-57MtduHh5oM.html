not giving up on old hardware the enter
max liquid tech tr4 - all in one liquid
CPU cooler has a massive contact plate
made just for thread Ripper and is rated
for 500 watts of heat dissipation high
pressure pwm fans mount to rubber
channels on the radiator to absorb
vibration and the sexy logo and edge
lighting on the block is addressable for
syncing with your motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more I had almost given
up on this monitor here this is my first
4k monitor it's from honor price you
can't actually buy this this particular
model anymore but it served me well and
although I don't use it as a primary
monitor it's been a floater and recently
I got a really cool nude gigabyte r-tx
2080 TI and I went to test it out and I
realized that this monitor wasn't
working anymore the problem was that the
power input in the back and I had known
this was going out for a while because
when the plug would be plugged in and it
would wiggle it would sometimes turn off
and the power would be weird sometimes
and sometimes I have to unplug it and
plug it back in
I've had this monitor for four years so
over time this plug has worn out and
finally gave out on me just a few days
back that's the weekend after Black
Friday and I wasn't even planning on
making a video on this today I was
actually in the verge of buying a new 4k
monitor and then I was like wait no I
know where the point of failure is on
this monitor I should really give it a
shot and just take it apart and see what
can be done so I'm gonna walk you back
through that because I think I've
already fixed it but I can show you what
was wrong those I'm working with today
are my iFixit kits I'll put a link to
this in the description it's not
sponsored or anything that this is the
kit that I got during track you had
worse it's got many my screwdrivers of
course and then I did have to bust out
the soldering iron soldering wick and
some I'm using lead-free solder cuz
that's all I have
I'm not at all intending this to be a
tutorial or anything I just wanted to
show you guys what I did and again this
is a four year old monitor it's not
under warranty or anything so if it
wasn't gonna work I was just gonna have
to send it to a recycling place or
something like that so a couple sticking
plates to get passed and one was getting
the actual housing undone for that I had
to figure out where the screws are
there's three across here there's a few
smaller ones across here there's a
couple more on the corners that hold on
the plate that goes across the front
with the monoprice logo on it after
getting those all up I can sort of start
prying along the edge and get this side
up but the top is still very much stuck
in place so for that I used a few
sputters from my eye fix-it kits to sort
of work in along the edge push it slowly
and firmly along this edge here and that
would get the tabs that are holding the
top of the monitor back piece in place
to release of course once you get the
panel separated from the back piece you
want to be very careful because there's
gonna be several wires in there that are
connecting them so don't just go pulling
it off inspect which wires are in there
first and in particular there is a flat
ribbon cable that goes along with back
here that was taped down which I had to
untape as best I could so I took was
removing four screws to get the main
motherboard removed and I'm trying to
leave as many of these cables plugged in
as possible so I don't have to remember
where to plug stuff back in just
manipulate it around and get a better
look at what's going on so here's the
power plug and I have already fixed it
like I said but basically the problem
was it was wobbling back and forth it's
got a couple connections on the side
here and then there's a wire going down
there in the back that actually goes and
connects to the PCB itself and because a
solder point was the main thing that was
holding this on or whenever there's
pressure put on this plug eventually
over time it worked and broke so all I
had to do is get my soldering iron get a
bit of solder heat that up and resolder
that joint I'm not the best with the
soldering iron so I didn't record that
but you know blah blah blah like that
I actually ended up using a little bit
too much solder so I had to use my
solder wick to pull some of it off of
there but I ended up with a pretty good
connection there and this is much more
stable and with that Jerry solder it was
just a matter
putting everything back together as best
as I could remember and I also want to
point out that I already did sort of a
loose fitting together of everything so
that I could just get the power plug
back in to make sure that we have power
again now I'm going to be putting
everything all the way back together
one more quick test before I put the
stand back on no yeah I was all wobbly
before it's much more stable Matt yeah
we have a power led
one final test yay
so there you go guys this video has been
sort of cherdon off-the-cuff so I hope
you've enjoyed it and just a message
again if you have old electronics that
have stopped working maybe take them
apart first before you decide to throw
them in the recycling bin
and see if there's something you can do
to get them functional again because I
will definitely be getting more usage
out of this one last thing I wanted to
share and that is why why I am so in
need of a 4k monitor I mean testing a 20
atti of course it's a good reason for
that but don't I have other 4k monitors
kind of yeah but not out here in the
garage where I have the main streaming
and capture system this is a 2560 by
1440 that's a 2560 by 1440 that is a
1440 widescreen then here in the
computer room I have two 4k monitors but
they are both mounted to my desk so that
is very challenging to move I was gonna
have the only option of borrowing my
wife's 4k monitor but that's 43 inches
and it looks like she's using it so
that's not an option I think so for that
reason I'm very glad this fix was
successful because I didn't wanna have
to go out and buy another 4k monitor and
this one's a lot easier to bring in
there connect up to the 4k capture
system so I can test something like the
20 atti and get the on screen stats and
everything like that but one last thing
before I go I wanted to mention just to
be clear that my wife works for
monoprice this monitor isn't even for
sale anymore or anything like that so
I'm not trying to sell it or anything I
will post a link to the iFixit kit in
the video description down below and
maybe my soldering iron too because that
was pretty useful for this little
project that's all for this video though
guys thank you so much for watching hit
that thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
