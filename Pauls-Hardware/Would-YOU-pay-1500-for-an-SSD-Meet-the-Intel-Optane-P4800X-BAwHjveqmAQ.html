called the SSD DCP 4800 X it has a
whopping 375 gigabyte capacity and it
only costs one thousand five hundred and
twenty US dollars MSRP this is an
enterprise device made for data centers
and server arrays if the catchy name and
crazy high price didn't tip you off but
it's also the first commercially
available product to release featuring
Intel 3d crosspoint technology the new
method of storing and recalling bits of
data in a solid-state drive
Intel products with 3d crosspoint as
well as Intel controllers and software
will be part of a family of products
called octane so for those of you who
don't get really excited about new SSD
technology here's what I'm going to do
start off with some details on the
underlying technology 3d crosspoint then
some specifics about the DCP 4800 X
that's releasing today with wide
availability in the second half of 2017
and then I'll close with some discussion
about future possibilities for obtain
products especially if you're wondering
how this might affect you if you're a
home builder of desktop PCs for gaming
and other stuff that doesn't involve a
data center so 3d crosspoint has been in
the works for a long time eight plus
years because storage is slow even with
SSDs that are much much faster than
mechanical hard drives your permanent
non-volatile storage is still the
slowest part of your computer if you
consider a manned package for example
the little rectangles on your SSDs PCB
that actually store the data a 3d
crosspoint package would look roughly
the same and perform the same basic
function of remembering the ones and
zeros that make up your operating system
files or your mp3 collection 3d
crosspoint uses completely different
technology than manned internally though
and although intel won't tell us the
trade secrets like what metals are using
and why they went with a Green Bay
Packers color scheme you can get the
general idea that 3d means it's 3d
stackable and crosspoint means the
intersecting traces that you can see
here in gray can access the data cells
that are shown in yellow and green to
either store a bit or read a bit of data
from each cell this means that the data
stored where 3d crosspoint is accessible
at a granular level you can access or
store data down to the word or bit line
as opposed to accessing a byte at a time
like RAM does or typically four kilobyte
pages like
and flash does the upshot is that at the
3d crosspoint ship level performance
versus NAND is a thousand times faster
with a thousand times the endurance and
it's also about ten times denser than
DRAM unfortunately this raw performance
is somewhat hamstrung because these 3d
crosspoint chips still must integrate
seamlessly with existing computer
technology so we're limited by existing
standards bus speeds and the expectation
that the operating systems have when it
comes to how data storage will work so
for now obtain devices with 3d
crosspoint will still use byte level
access methods like randos this level of
granularity does mean that octane drives
can do away with the program erase
cycles that NAND based SSDs rely on
because man based SSDs must rewrite a
block at a time also that means no need
for trim or defrag messing with 3d
crosspoint as the data can be written in
place just update a cell state rather
than deleting it and rewriting it also
if you're wondering the 3d crosspoint
chips they're currently producing pack
128 gigabytes of storage per die and are
manufactured on 20 nanometer lithography
the SSD DCP 4800 X will debut as a 375
gigabyte SSD with a PCI Express gen3 by
4 interface and will still use the nvm
the interface specification so it can
drop into any system that supports those
specs yes even an AMD system although
Intel understandably won't be validating
risings compatibility 375 gig adding
card version shown here is available in
limited quantities as of today March
19th with broad availability in the
second half of this year at 1520 dollars
a 750 gig version else also coming in q2
and a 1.5 terabyte version launches in
the second half no word on pricing for
those yet Intel is also prepping a 2.5
inch you to drive the 375 gig version of
that one arrives in q2 750 gig and 1.5
terabyte versions are expected again in
the second half if you're using a V on
platform 4 1951 dollars you can get a
software and hardware bundle the P 4800
X with Intel memory drive technology
this is an example of a different
implementation of an op tain drive aside
from just using it as draw storage
memory drive technology is soft
it will function as a middleware layer
between the drive and your operating
system booting prior to the OS and
integrating the P 4800 x transparently
with system memory Intel says up to
eight times the amount of system memory
can be allocated via opt in drive so in
theory you could go from like 128 gigs
of system ram on a server up to like a
terabyte by pairing that with opting
which would be huge for handling large
data sets required by certain
applications such as transaction
processing simulations ai and even in
certain situations gaming early P 4800 X
units from Intel's early development
program will have a three year warranty
and wide launch products will have a
five year warranty so what does all this
actually mean to you
it doesn't mean you should run out and
grab a p40 800 X for your gaming rig
hopefully that is clear given the price
and how many times I've said data
centers in fact that DC and the name
stands for data center but this
technology will be coming to quiet
devices that's you know standard at home
users like you and me in the future and
hopefully they will also be more
affordable as a standalone drive the p40
hundred x excelled in responsiveness and
I ops performance input output
operations per second handling huge
amounts of requests for small chunks of
data at least according to intel's
benchmarks which show that even when
counting the drive was between one
hundred and seven hundred and fifty
megabytes per second a random writes the
latency still hovers around zero the p
4800 x in this chart is that orange line
down at the bottom right by zero by the
way low queue depth performances also
vastly improved most SSD synthetic tests
like i've run these myself artificially
load up the SSD to a queue depth of 32
or beyond which is a great way to show
what a drive can do but it's impractical
considering that most use case scenarios
will never go beyond a queue depth of
maybe four or five the p40 800 x can hit
a hundred thousand I offset queue depth
one and 300k a queue depth five Intel
was also using mixed tests with 70%
reads and thirty percent rates with
minimal latency reduction and crazy good
quality of service meaning that even the
slowest latency is recorded for each
transaction that the drivers performing
are still very fast which is sure to
catch the eye of the IT crowd out there
oh and also listed endurance is there
drive rates per day over the entire
capacity of the SSD within its warranty
which for SSD is absolutely insane and
Intel is usually pretty conservative
with like endurance numbers so that's
impressive too all things considered the
P 4800 X seems poised to revolutionize
data center storage whether you need all
those eye offs best-in-class quality of
service or your website's load faster or
crazy-good endurance but these use cases
again aren't as much use to most of you
who watch my channel also bear in mind
that these sequential reads and writes
that your standard NAND based SSDs like
to tout like 500 megabytes per second or
whatnot are not obtains Forte or at
least we assume that because Intel
didn't show sequential read and write
performance at all I look forward to the
consumer versions of these drives though
and I hope we'll have access to some
variant of the Intel memory drive
technology so we can trick our system
into thinking that the opt-in Drive is
system memory for video editing I could
imagine all my 4k footage sitting in
system memory for stutter free timeline
scrubbing for gaming I could imagine
massive open world simulations with
really high resolution textures and
pretty much zero draw distance
limitations remember most developers
design games to work across a variety of
PC configurations often assuming that
there's only going to be four or eight
gigs of system memory to work with and
even less vram I might also imagine
Intel partnering with a well-known game
studio to leverage obtained technology
and a highly anticipated upcoming title
but sometimes my imagination gets the
better of me that would be a pretty cool
way to show it off though anyway let me
know what you guys can come up with as
far as more ideas for how faster storage
with minimal latency could help out on
the desktop side of the PC space make
sure to hit that like button on your way
