probing Paul this is episode number 9
and this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video where I
answer questions asked by all of you
guys I usually do this towards the end
of the month but this month I'm more
towards middle of the month I don't know
last month I actually did this from the
Philippines so that was a little bit
different than that when I usually do it
but that's where I was on the map right
there and then of course in months past
I have started by showing you this
screen going all the way back down the
line to the original screen where we
talked about the original name for
probing Paul and where it all came about
it was a great mystery but now it's been
solved
anyway let's dive right into the
questions all these were taken from last
month's episode so they were all asked
in the comments section on YouTube and
thanks to all you guys who posted these
we'll start off with a question from
James Wood hey Paul loved the vids I
just bought a i7 5820k because I heard
the overclocked ability of it is much
better than the 6800 K and I got it for
$350 new but it worries me that I might
be missing out on nice features that
6800 K has did I make a mistake
that's a good question and especially
when it goes from one generation to the
next on something like an Intel lousiest
platform there's often very similar
specs from CPU to CPU so I think you are
okay because you got your 5820k for $350
that's a very good price for 5820k
however I will say that if the prices
were more comparable like right now it's
something like 75 $200 difference from a
5820k to a 6800 k if it's more like a 30
$40 difference then I would say just go
for the 6800 K what you're going to get
by going with the newer CPU the 6800 K
which is Broadwell instead of haswell-e
mainly as 128 gig memory support the
5820k only supports 64 gigs 6800 K
supports up 228 other than that
instructions per clock level 2 6800 K is
a little bit faster it also ships with a
slightly higher clock speed I think it's
3.8 gigahertz which is 3.6 gigahertz
however if you're overclocking the 5820k
a lot of the reports and it's tough to
say broadly generally speaking but from
what I have gathered online by reading a
few aggregate websites that take lots of
results from lots of different people
5820k does seem to overclock maybe just
a little bit more but it might be
because it's been out longer
which is this 1600 K which just fewer
people have or fewer people have pushed
more aggressively all that said if you
can overclock your 5820k better or to a
higher frequency than 6800 K it might
outperform it with some things so I
think you're fine as is but if you guys
are looking at this and thinking like
what should I buy right now again I'd
say 30 to 40 bucks if the if it's that
much more expensive just go ahead and
get to 6800 K if you're looking at 70 80
100 dollars difference then 5820k will
still do just fine for you and a good
question so thank you for asking
next question is from Vishnu Prasad what
do you think about those graphics card
boxes used to convert laptops into
gaming machines are they viable and I
believe what you're talking about is
something like this right here which is
a razor core they're certainly viable
and especially viable if you're a
particular type of person I would say
that particular type of person would be
someone who likes to have just one
computer because I will say there is
definitely some niceness about only
having a single computer which is off in
a laptop that you can take with you
wherever you go so you're always just
working on the same machine and you have
sort of the same nago whether you're at
home the razor core in my opinion is
very expensive it's $500 just for the
enclosure by itself not including the
graphics card you put in there 500 bucks
is pretty much the cost of a low-end
laptop or like a low low to mid-range
gaming machine so it's really the
investment there that that holds me back
from saying yes go for it apart from the
cost it is very nice to just have your
laptop take it plug in and suddenly have
much better graphics support and you can
even have that razor core or whatever
other external device that's not the
only one that's out there connect it up
to you know a monitor or something so
you don't worry about plugging in cables
and that so it is convenience it is nice
and it does benefit some people who
really like to have that single machine
experience for me I probably would go
for it because I like having other
systems for gaming that I use at home
but all-in-all yeah it depends on your
preference but I would say they seem
very pricey right now which which is sad
but anyway next question from all bub
I'm building my first PC and I think
know everything my question is how much
anti-static prep do I need to build do I
need to build it's if I get a mod mat on
a wrist strap it's another 50 bucks is
that required and thank you for thanking
me Bob and I'm glad that I've provided
some inspiration for you all right your
first mistake here is thinking that you
know everything about computers I
certainly do not and neither does anyone
else
maybe there's maybe Wendell Wendell
might know everything but back to your
actual question I would say no don't
bother and investing in a mod mat and a
wrist strap right now I rarely use
anti-static techniques when I'm doing
stuff like picking up a motherboard and
handling and stuff like that that said I
would recommend doing more anti-static
prevention if you live somewhere that's
very dry and very dusty are this very
windy you know if you live in I don't
know Arizona or some places in
California if you live in the desert and
you find that you constantly get static
shocks from like a door knob or
something like that then maybe consider
doing something a little bit more I mean
and you don't need the mod mat I mean
get a get a wrist strap those are very
inexpensive usually five bucks maybe ten
bucks and they're they're pretty easy to
come by so that's probably the best
preventative measure you need beyond
that if you don't invest anything just
get your case have your case out
somewhere and touch the case and that
will equalize the static build-up the
static electricity build-up between you
in the case it will not necessarily
ground you but it'll neutralize it
enough to not damage any components that
you happen to pick up with an electric
discharge
I have never to my knowledge damaged or
caused a piece of computer hardware to
not work anymore by a static discharge
or static shock so yeah that's that's
why I can I'm concerned about it less
that doesn't mean you should ignore it
be aware of it but it's usually not a
huge deal all right since my last
episode was from the Philippines I have
a couple questions that were
specifically about the Philippines to
answer really quickly these are kind of
connected Jason Louie and Adrian kabbadi
kabbadi sorry if I'm missing pronouncing
your last names Jason asks why are you
in the Philippines do you have relatives
there yes
my wife's family lives in the
Philippines we were there for her
grandmother's her Lola's birthday and
she turned 97 years old
yeah that's impressive Adrienne asked is
your wife Filipina and and I think I
just answered that yes yes she is a
couple more here
Gabriel Pasquale asks do you have any
comments on the slow Internet of our
country Stewart says hi
thank you hi Stuart gee bdx was
commenting that I am on an island and he
Gabriel just wants to know what I
consider fast and if the internet speeds
were fast there we had internet set up
at my wife's family's house specifically
for us to be there because my wife works
on the Internet just like I do and so we
needed to have connection we had about
five Meg's down and about 1 Meg up which
was perfectly adequate for us so it
wasn't bad that wasn't bad at all next
question from mark Himmler I already
have an msi gtx 1060 gaming X with 6
gigs of ram a serenade for me to upgrade
to a 1070 games are having higher video
demands
I'm afraid my 1016 won't be able to
handle it in a year or so also as an RX
480 crossfire then better than a single
1070 all right so that that second
question first yes and our X 480
crossfire is better than a single 1070
in situations where you can take
advantage of crossfire and that's not
Universal across the board so I
typically would recommend a faster
single card rather than a crossfire
configuration out of the gate but let me
let me answer your question more in
general here because basically what
you're saying is I have this graphics
card right now I'm worried about in the
future at not being able to keep up with
the games let's say I live in the now
for right now what are you using to game
on your monitor in particular if you're
gaming at 1080 you're 1066 gig is
totally fine for that and whatever games
you're playing right now run some sort
of monitoring utility whether it's fraps
or something like MSI Afterburner or
EVGA precision X or something like that
and just keep an eye on your frame rates
if you have a 60 Hertz 1080 monitor and
your graphics card is able to push 60 to
100 frames per second in most games that
you play and with you know even if you
have to turn some settings just slightly
down and that kind of thing and you're
happy with it then be happy with it for
now and wait until next year when you
actually get the next game and you
actually start to see like oh crap I'm
only doing 40 frames per sec now per
second 40 fps now in this new game and I
wasn't getting something like that
before and then consider upgrading
because those new games that you're
worried about aren't out yet
the new graphics cards and other new
computer hardware that's going to be out
at that time as well is not out yet
and you'll probably be able to get a
better deal on those or a better deal on
the stuff that's out right now at that
time in the future there's a few wait
things are always going to get less
expensive and new hardware is always
going to come out and you'll have more
and better options in the future thank
you for your question mark
Devon Johnson asks if you had to choose
whose PC would you smash with a hammer
Kyle's hotline are my arctic panther is
it that's a very tough question Devon
I'll do a follow-up question that's been
asked to me but I don't have an actual
screen shot up here which is where is
our Kick Panther because that's not our
kick fanta in the background any any
more arctic Panthers in the computer
room along with hotbox my wife's
computer and I do have a project coming
up probably next week I'm going to be
like kind of redoing that room and
reconfiguring the desks and and maybe
even making it so I can live stream from
in there that would be kind of cool so
yeah you'll be seeing it some more but I
moved it in there because I actually use
it for editing a lot more now than when
it was out here and I was mainly just
using it for gaming back to your main
question though whose PC would I smash
with a hammer if I had to choose I
probably take a really like pragmatic
approach to it and so be it would be
subjective to is the smash main
completely destroy everything or just
smash mean like get a couple good shots
of video of like hitting it with the
hammer and then like okay it's all good
because for me it comes down to like
investment of time and the value and
performance of the hardware that's
inside so for me investment of time is
that power supply I have never spent
more time on a single piece of computer
hardware than I did sleeving that power
supply so I don't want that to go
anywhere so if I have to destroy
everything I probably say I'll smash
Kyle's hot line PC because I wouldn't
have to kill my power supply which I
just want to keep forever simply because
I invested so much time in it however if
I can just like beat it up a little bit
and then like maybe salvage some parts
and maybe save the power supply then I'd
say arctic panther simply because it's
got two 980 s in it whereas the hot line
has two 980 TI s and it's just a more
powerful system
yeah anyway so there's there's my
pragmatic answer for you for that one
click one click one from Danson Dhoni
what are your thoughts on quantum
computing and how do you think it will
affect gaming and hardware enthusiasts
out there dan I am still trying to wrap
my mind around quantum computing I have
a vague concept of how it works and
probabilities and superpositions and all
that kind of stuff
I think the potential for it is
incredible it's like the next step for
humankind
type thing there's also a lot of
questions about it as far as
appropriateness when it we take it and
do machine learning with it and that
kind of thing you know the singularity
and computers becoming self-aware I mean
all this science fiction sort of stuff
starts to pop out of the woodwork I
don't think it will affect gaming and
hardware enthusiasts for some time I
mean I would say five to ten years but
that's just a number I'm pretty much
pulling out of my backside I'd like to
understand it better because it's
definitely messes with your mind just
trying to figure it out but um yeah I
mean it's definitely something to keep
an eye on but I don't think we're going
to see any quantum computers available
from Intel in the next five years or
anything like that
Alexander Radetzky says what's the best
processor you can throw on a mini ITX
board ideally with a maximum number of
cores well the answer is the motherboard
which is the asrock mini ITX x99 board
which is right here
ixnay 9x 99e ITX AC asrock is the only
motherboard manufacturer that has gone
so far as to put an x 99 chipset and an
LGA 2011 - v3 sockets on a mini ITX
board it does come with its limitations
though such as only to dim slots for
ddr4 memory it comes with this sort of
custom unique whatever designed
proprietary cooler and there in order to
actually fit something this big and a
mini ITX form factor and I mean it's
it's got its limitations so the answer
is a 69 50 X I don't know if this has Z
on support there might be a really high
core count Xeon you could drop into this
or something like that but if you're
looking at the consumer side 6950 x10
core 220 thread
beast of a processor but I really feel
like you would be
um hamstringing it by dropping it into
this board because not only are you
limited to two DIMM slots so you can't
take advantage of like 128 gigs of
memory support or anything like that
you've only got a single PCI Express PCI
Express expansion slot so your 40 PCIe
lanes on that processor are largely
going to go on use because the most
you're going to use out of that is like
16 by 16 of your PCIe lanes and then you
know you've got some other stuff
connected and that it's going to use up
a bit more but you can't expand and add
more and take advantage of it so 6 + 50
X is the answer I don't think that's
practical the best practical in my
opinion CPU to drop into a mini ITX PC
is the one that I did in my video my
monthly builds video for this month
where I tried to build the fastest mini
ITX gaming PC possible which would be a
6700 K for right now for core 8 thread
or when kb light comes out supposed to
be beginning of next year then probably
7700 k assuming that they continue the
same naming scheme for their processors
ok that's all for this video guys I hope
you've enjoyed it I hope
Hiro's snoring in the background hasn't
distracted you all very much
I'll be back very soon with more videos
hit the thumbs up button if you enjoyed
this and of course leave me comments in
the comment section for next month's
probing Paul thanks again for watching
and I'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
