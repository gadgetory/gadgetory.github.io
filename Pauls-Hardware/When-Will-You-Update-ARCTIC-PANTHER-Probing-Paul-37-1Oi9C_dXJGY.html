Paul this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video that I
do every month you ask questions I
answer them and all the questions I'm
answering this month are from last
month's video so if you have questions
for me that you want me to answer next
month leave them in the comment section
down below actually kind of already did
one this month but that was because I
skipped to May because it was busy in
May so this is kind of the second one
for June but you guys you guys don't
care right you get to have more answers
to your questions
speaking of Q&amp;amp;A and the past history of
probing Paul's take a look at my probing
Paul playlist if you want to see the old
probing Paul's many times have I been
probed and all of them were entertaining
and memorable so let's start off with
the first question this comes from Cody
Ward he says love your videos Paul any
plans to update arctic Panther and how
did you come up with that name so guys
don't know Arctic Panther is my epic
water-cooled system that is behind me
it's gone through a couple different
revisions already and if you want to
check it out I have a full playlist with
my Arctic Panther build over the various
months in different times most recently
was 2017 Wow but I did update it last
year for instance I removed the flow
indicator there if you guys are really
interested this often-overlooked video
is where I actually wrote my ode to
arctic panther and I had a bunch of fans
send in pictures where they took the
original Arctic Panther and and did
their own artistic rendition of it
beginning back to actually answering
your questions I think yes there is sort
of a concept for a new version of Arctic
Panther in the works I don't want to say
too much beyond that because I tend to
promise things and then people expect
that I'll actually do them like my HD PC
but the name Arctic Panther actually
came earlier on in this whole build
process before I even had the name I I
pinged you guys and I just asked for
suggestions so it was kind of like this
video in my Q&amp;amp;A series somebody
commented it and said hey you should
maybe call it Arctic Panther and I was
like I kind of like that name it sounds
like it's trying to be badass but it
actually sounds somewhat ridiculous and
that's why I went with it also arctic
panther just sort of gives you the
impression that it's like a dangerous
predator that will maul and destroy any
gaming tasks or her processing tasks
that it comes across No
you're doing good Joe oh I did that I
think that they're good and a lip pop
mm-hmm
next question though it's from Giovanni
Pia he said does or is your tesla
powerwall work like a UPS for your
computer setup or do you use a UPS on
top of your solar power systems UPS
system is proportionately cost way more
than battery systems for homes I haven't
done a cost comparison between those but
if you guys haven't seen it check out my
video series on my tesla powerwall and
solar installation i have a bunch of
time lapses and other stuffs actually I
promise you a one-year follow-up on this
that is also in the works so that will
be coming soon but I got a lot of really
positive feedback from that series to
answer your question though I still have
UPS's or on an uninterruptible power
supplies because although the power wall
and the solar gives me whole home
battery backup in case of a grid outage
it's not quite so good at dealing with
spikes surges and voltage drops from
turning stuff on and on throughout the
house so if I have a bunch of stuff on
the same circuit and you know the
condenser around the refrigerator goes
on or the a/c kicks in or there's some
other sudden power draw you can still
have a dip that might cause a computer
to have a weird glitch or even reset so
I have two UPS's one that's out here in
the garage and one back for my main
computer setup and that is just again to
make sure that even if there is an
outage on a single breaker that I still
have power going to the system so I can
shut it down or save work or whatever is
necessary there next question from the
villain he says hey Pawan will you do
those live PC builds again I really
enjoy watching you build a PC from start
to finish good thing to point out and
actually thank you for reminding me
because it's something that I haven't
done in a while I have enjoyed the live
PC builds that I've done in the past
because it's kind of fun to just turn
the cameras on sit there and work answer
some questions that come in and chat in
the meantime so yes I do plan to do more
PC builds kind of to that end I did some
recent updates on my streaming system
back here and actually installed triple
4k capture cards so I still need to test
streaming in 4k or even just higher
resolution than 1080 but I've got two
Elgato 4k 60 pros in there as well as a
mage well 4k loop through card and
they're really nice so that's been
working really well so far I just have
one test at the end of that stream where
I was gaming
Ultra wide 34 40 by 1440 and then I had
a couple 4k cameras going at the same
time on me and my hands but a more
practical use case of this for me would
be to actually do a stream with multiple
cameras that I can switch between that
are all higher resolutions so yes that
is one of the goals of that new setup
the thing I'm still figuring out is
whether I want to leave this system as
is with an X 99 platform and a 69 50 X
or whether I want to upgrade the core
system here because well it has been
mostly doing what I want there's still a
few quirks here and there and it's
getting to the point where I'm like
maybe I should just do a system overhaul
on it but I'll figure that out in the
future but yes
more light builds coming soon next
question from RS panther what brand of
test bench do you use I actually have
several test benches the one that is
probably most visible is the one that I
put together
- back in 2016 the Praxis wet bench
which you can kind of see the box for
right there is what I assembled I did it
in a live bill hey speak of the devil
this was a live build originally it was
it over a two-hour video the assembly
process for the Praxis web men took a
while but is it is a nice piece of gear
practice a primo chill the manufacturer
of it actually has an updated version of
it that I haven't checked out but that's
the one that you'll probably see more
often if you're looking at me with like
a really high-end testbed or something
like that like I've used in certain
videos as well as like if you look at my
sort of feeble attempts at Jenny and the
RIP J and rip G and benchmarking battles
that went on last year that's that's
what I had it set up on and it's a it's
a very nice set up but it's pretty
expensive it's much more like I think on
the visual side of things so if you're
looking for a test bench and you don't
want to spend a ton of money I still
recommend the Lian Li PCT 6 dB
it's available in black and I think
there's a gray finish - it's just a
simple test bench I feel like it used to
be a little bit less than this but still
maybe around $80 if you look on Newegg
it's got the basics it's all metal it's
got a power switch it's a pretty good
design it comes flat packed you assemble
it yourself it's got some spaces on the
bottom for drives and optical bays but
it's just a nice open test bench and it
has this bar going across the top which
you can remove if you need more access
to the hardware underneath but it
actually is a very nice just handle so
you can kind of pick up the whole thing
and move it around which is convenient
for test benches so if you want a test
bench to get yourself up and running and
you don't want to spend like 150
books like some of the nation ones cost
consider this one I'll put a link to it
no description next question from Soren
DP so Powell just typos what kind of
exercise do you do to get back in the
game and I believe this is follow up
some of the questions I was talking
about when I was talking about my
daughter being born and just mental
challenges and what do I do to kind of
kind of keep myself from getting too
bogged down and exercise is typically
the go-to for me if I'm feeling like I'm
really worn down and not feeling it like
if usually means that I'm not getting
enough exercise I don't want to at all
give the impression that I'm very good
at exercise that I have like a routine
that's down pat but typically it's just
dog walking about a two-mile loop that I
do with the dogs around here my
neighborhood or we also have a couple of
parks that we go up to I try to get
those in three to four times a week I
haven't been as good with that recently
but I do want to sort of get back into
that beyond that I have a simple routine
of sort of just body weight lifting
exercise that I also have not been doing
nearly as much as I'm supposed to not
just involves some push-ups and squats
and sort of a set of those that I go
through but I'm gonna use your comments
request here to reinvigorate my
commitment to doing that on a more
regular basis that means that I have to
go and do that now this afternoon I hope
you follow through with that but that's
basically what I do if I'm really being
serious about it I should probably
either get a gym membership or a
personal trainer or something like that
because I think the thing I'm mostly
missing out on is like some heavier
cardio workout I'd like to get my heart
rate up a little bit more and I guess I
just have to make a promise to you guys
that I'll do that more in the future
you guys should too everyone stay in
shape next question from ghosts 99 I
thought this one was interesting he got
a cyber PowerPC so a prebuilt in late
2016 only started using it in January
2017 until May then it's been in storage
for like a couple years since then when
he pulls it out and goes to reboot it
and use it again what things should he
consider so if you've got a system
that's been out of use for a couple
years
what should you worry about when booting
it up again well first off just that it
starts hopefully that is a case
computers that are in storage are
usually just fine computers usually only
get dusty when they're on and there's
fans are on that are pulling stuff
through there you can't have situations
with like thermal paste drying out
depending on your graphics card and CPU
installation so I would initially just
do sort of a reality check quick clean
make sure you get any dust bunnies that
are out of there that might be blocking
air flow and then second thing as
zooming that it boots up and starts okay
and gets into Windows run all your
windows updates ASAP you want to make
sure everything's patched up to as
current as you can possibly get it and
then I would definitely run a hardware
monitoring utility such as hardware in
four or HW monitor just to make sure
that your temperatures are looking okay
at idle you should be seeing something
like 30 to 50 degrees Celsius for your
CPU and GPU and then of course maybe
play a game test it to make sure that
while you're actually using it under
load things are getting too hot is that
be my biggest concern other than dust
buildup and make sure making sure your
software is up-to-date is making sure
that nothing has failed when it comes to
the contact points for the stuff that's
in your computer that's keeping stuff
cool heat sinks and thermal paste drying
out and becoming useless is the main
thing and if that is the case you know
you have hardware that is overheating
it's not too difficult to pull that out
do a remounts of a GPU cooler for
example with new thermal paste and you
can you should be able to get your
system back up and running
that's question from right Rob Siro hey
Paul who in the hell decided that wires
should be called cables just because
they're in a PC and why right trap zero
works with cars where he does wiring and
cars wiring versus cable management's
rat trap I did a quick search I found
this page on copper wire granulator comm
that is talking about the differences
between wires and cables there are two
terms that are used in electrical and
communications fields often confused but
they are actually different a wire is a
single conductor while cable is two or
more insulated wires wrapped in one
jacket so if you look at most of the
cables that are inside computers you'll
find twisted pairs in the case of
networking and other connections most of
the time you're not talking about just a
single wire going from point to point
that is not to say that it is universal
there are definitely some cables in
computers that should be called wires I
would say like the little grounding
wires that you have for some power
supplies that you're supposed to attach
to the case in certain situations but I
think the actual answer to your question
here would be that they are legitimately
called cables simply because they're
insulated multiple wires in a single
jacket
versus and that makes a cable versus a
single wire which is just a wire next
question here is from Xiao style aka Joe
the editor because he commented on last
month's video and said
here's a link to my youtube channel
because he's a shameless self-promoter
no he actually did that he's here I'm
making fun of he did that because I said
I would post the link to his channel in
the description last time and I did not
so now I'm doing that
here's Joe's channel everyone go
subscribe if you're not he he always has
really good hair in his videos but Jojo
like suppose videos from time to time so
if you're ever curious about some of the
behind the scenes stuff what else do you
post about editing a lot of the artwork
he does just just rants he just rants
about people he hates and lots of food
blogs - right Joe's embarrassed cuz I'm
promoting his channel but I just wanted
to follow up on last last last video
because I did say I would do that just a
couple more questions though from a
paper airplane paper airplane I get it
for probing Paul Jun where is the best
place to get wings in your town this is
a good question and I don't know if this
is gonna cause any controversy but our
go-to is wing stop you guys have wing
stop around you I just I like the
flavors they have and we used to live
like right across the street from one so
we go there probably a little too
frequently now there isn't one near us
so if we get wing stop it's more of like
a special treat or special occasion but
if you guys know of wings or a wing
place that does it better than wing
stuff let me know because I'm curious to
try them out because wings are damn good
Jody ever and actually it's just to add
to the controversy because Joe just
brought up Buffalo Wild Wings sucks I
hate Buffalo Wild Wings it's a terrible
place and I've never had a good time
there because I went there like alright
I can I don't understand like a sports
bar and you go in there and they're
playing the sports and it's loud and
everything I'm fine with that but you
call Buffalo a while with Wild Wings
your wings should be good the Wild Wings
I had at Buffalo Wild Wings were pissed
poor and I was very disappointed not
going back there and the final question
which is more of a comment is from a
dent
he said space trip you like synth wave
much yeah so this has been brought up a
few times but when I'm showing you guys
old videos and everything and it's got
my suggested feat over here there's a
lot of a lot of synth wave going on
there specifically aesthetic I feel like
I've been listening to a lot of but I
just whenever I'm trying to get work
done and I just want some background
music I found
these to be often very easy to listen to
and and satisfying in many different
ways and lucky posts new sets of music
well I guess not all the time to fairly
frequently anyway aesthetic there's a
lot of other since Wave artists out
there who have YouTube channels but I'll
post a link to that in the description
too if you want to listen to some of the
same music that I've been listening to
because Joe's super tired of it right
they're different tracks every time it's
different the synthesizers they have
different tones and different music that
they play but guys that's gonna wrap it
up for this episode or probing Paul
thank you all so much for the questions
I hope I have answered them to some
level of satisfaction and of course
leave me questions in the comment
section if you want me to answer them
for next month's I will be coming back
and doing another one of these in July
thanks again for watching we'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
