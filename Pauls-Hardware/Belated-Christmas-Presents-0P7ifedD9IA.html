liquid ml 360 our RGB clip the sponsor
link in the video's description what's
up guys it is the day after Christmas
also sometimes known as Boxing Day in
Canada in the UK I believe but leading
up to Christmas we all have a lot on our
to-do list and sometimes it gets so busy
that some things can fall through the
cracks
to that end Joe my editor asked me a few
weeks back if I might have something
that might work as a computing solution
for his mom she's using a very old
computer very out of dates and she just
needs something that will work for
internet browsing and maybe watching a
youtube video here and there also Joe
bought me a Christmas present so today
we're going to talk about one a low cost
low impact solution for his mom to use
as a internet browsing computer and then
I'm also gonna open Joe's present that
he brought for me here look at that it's
beautiful as you can see this gift is to
me from Joe is maybe something my wife
enhancing Hey
it is an overwatch bottle with the note
inside yeah tracer right there on the
front we have a very lovely note from
Joe water bottle because I keep spilling
stuff on my keyboard recently so this is
gonna be great next up well look at this
ooh
gingerbread pecan brittle that is
delicious
my wife loves brittle in all varieties
this is from Heather's confections
you can tell by the clacking noise it
makes
it's very high-quality brutal also this
is a consumable gift and if you're
trying to think of a gift for someone
something consumable eat consume and
then beautifully be done with yeah yeah
filled overwatch bottle with peanut
brittle dissolver almond brittle
Gingerbread pretty Conville and then of
course we have and infinite is this
infinity war oh look at that
Thanos did nothing wrong obviously
because he's on the top and that's where
the heroes of any story go we got Thanos
all of the Avengers in there most of
whom are dead now spoiler alert
and this is awesome Joe thank you and
the reason and this all has a it's not
like Joe just went and bought stuff
willy-nilly so just as hey dude err I
hope you like the gifts water bottles to
help you avoid any more accidents with
your clumsy ass spilling water over your
keyboards and I got the building if
you're able to you ad vanish half the
planet by snapping your fingers so I got
you the Thanos shirt share the candy
with Diana I definitely will and and
this shirt yeah I mean if I had the
glove just
good work thank you very much Joe you'll
be wearing that in a future video and
now let's move on to setting up this
Nook for Joe's mom so if you guys are
familiar with the Nook the next unit of
computing this actually launched back at
the beginning of 2013 so it's a about
five years old now but again we're
talking about an internet browsing and
maybe video watching machines so you
don't need a whole lot of power for that
and this was originally sold as a
bare-bones unit it's got an Intel Core
i3 in it specifically the i3 37 1 7u
which runs at 1.8 gigahertz it's a
dual-core CPU with hyper threading so
you get 4 threads and it's only got a 17
watt TDP so this is gonna draw a very
low amount of power also the Nook boxes
had this funny thing where he waiting
open them
it tried to make the Intel chime this
one appears to be broken though also
that's just a fact feature of the
packaging so not a huge deal Oh
unfortunately I have also included a
power cable for this because when you
originally bought it it came with the
power brick to supply power but not the
actual plug for this site other than
that you get instruction manual get the
Nook itself and then they include a base
amount because these are so small that
you could mount it to the back of a
monitor and then you have like a monitor
and PC all-in-one so it's nice little
accessory to have these are sold as
bare-bones units that they are available
in a very wide variety by the way guys
and they do have updated versions of
these so if you're looking for a simple
low-power solution for somebody who just
needs again basic computer usage these
are still a good choice this one of
course I already have so you don't need
to buy a new one let's take it apart
though and take a look at the inside so
again these are available in a wide
variety of flavors and this is a
bare-bones kit so it wouldn't include
that power adapter doesn't include a
wireless adapter but it does have an
antenna no mSATA or SSD so you need to
add storage and no memory I have already
kitted this one out I believe it's been
a little while since I opened it up but
hopefully all that stuff should already
be installed here because I did that in
the past
yeah I did sleeve goes around the
outside and here internally we can see a
couple som slots so again two of those
for memory expansion I've already
installed a patriot memory stick there
how much is this so we've already got 4
gigs installed and that should be plenty
for our needs and then for storage right
here we've got a 64 gig SSD this is
mSATA not MDOT to remember mSATA
before m2 became all the rage mSATA
looks huge now by the way but let's look
at the other side and I was trying to
pull the the motherboard out so he could
look at the other side but there's
actually several things that are kind of
taped in there I don't to mess up any of
those connections and I also realized
that the thing I was looking for is
right here anyway and has also already
been installed so again that is our
storage drive or SSD and beneath that we
have another slot there and that is a
mini PCI Express connection for a Wi-Fi
card so again if you had bought this
bare-bones you wouldn't have storage you
wouldn't have a Wi-Fi card but you'd
have the connection points here for the
antenna and you wouldn't have memory so
pop in those three things by accessing
from this side and then you have all of
the functional parts you need for a
computer the CPU which also includes the
graphics is mounted to the opposite side
of this PCB and it's passively cooled so
just read up these so beyond the
internals there we've got a USB 2.0 on
that side power and hard drive activity
buttons over here and then finally we
got an HDMI out for video a couple more
USBs there is an actual mini DisplayPort
there might be lightning compatible I
don't don't quote me on that and then
there's a Kensington lock since this is
very small if you are in a environment
where you feel it might be stole them
you can lock it down and then just a bit
of ventilation and of course the input
for the power unfortunately guys as it
turns out I have done some work with
this system I am not 100% sure when it
was but it's recent enough that the the
Wi-Fi is working which is good we have
Windows 10 installed which is also good
I'm gonna do an update and see how that
goes
he's an interesting update page your PC
is at risk I guess if you plug in and
old enough version of Windows 10 to the
Internet this is what you get I also
wanted to point out though that even
though we have a 64 gig SSD installed
Windows 10 is pretty slim so we still
got
46.5 gigs free it should be plenty you
to buy okay so it just got off the phone
with Microsoft's as a bonus in today's
video I am retesting kinguin Windows 10
licenses which I just purchased for a
little over $30 and activated on this
installation of Windows 10 just had to
call in a Microsoft to read them off the
activation ID and then they activated it
and read it back to me and now we're
good to go
so let's move on with some setup so
Windows activated it's just a matter of
running Windows Update we could have
done Windows Update without activating
windows but you know we hate that
watermark and we've proved that kinguin
still works as long as you're willing to
call in and do the voice activation
which you know it just takes a few
minutes no problem so I wanted to check
and just make sure everything is
functional with this system for further
use such as YouTube look here's a
youtube video on my channel there it is
playing back we can jump forward is
awesome nice clean play back wait let's
let's double check it if it's a 1080 can
it handle 1080 60 on YouTube yes yes it
can
so yeah we got 1080 60 playback going
just fine and this is with the windows
update running in the background so that
is cool just do a little web browsing
here we'll pull up Amazon loads nice and
quick you can do some shopping and then
the one other setup thing we're gonna do
here and this was requested by Joe and
we double checked and looked it up to
make sure it works because I've never
actually set this up before if you go to
Advanced Options with Windows Update you
can go to choose how and I'm sorry defer
upgrades is the checkbox we're gonna do
right here this will defer major updates
for a month or two so this system won't
get updated with a hasty Windows 10
update that might change some
functionality it'll wait and do the
updates only after they've been up for a
while and hopefully any bugs have been
fixed and we're gonna leave that on so
we have nothing to worry about when it
comes to Windows updates in the future
then the last thing I wanted to point
out is that there are modern nooks
available there's other small
form-factor pcs like ZOTAC makes a bunch
as well that are that are pretty nice
they all use very similar internal
hardware if you're talking about the
Intel based stuff but Intel now for
instance has Skull trail nooks that are
actually actually VR capable that have
Vega graphics integrated these do get a
bit more expensive though and they are
still bare-bones so you gotta kind of
weigh your options what benefit you're
getting from a really small computer and
lower power usage as well because you
compare this and the fact that they're
bare-bones and you have
and memory and storage to them and you
know maybe building just a full-size
computer for 800 or a thousand bucks
would be a better bet but there are of
course still lower end ones available
the compute stick also although in that
one I feel like it's a little bit more
an issue usage but you can get the basic
functionality of a computer for as
little as you know one hundred two
hundred to three hundred dollars add the
storage or the memory that you'd feel is
most useful for the system and then you
know you got a nice small low-power
computer that you can mount to the back
of a monitor or tuck away somewhere
oh I do want to say that this does
actually have an active cooling fan
under there although it's pretty quiet
so I said it was passive earlier it's it
is actively cooled because that's gonna
wrap it up for this video again I'll put
some links to the newer nukes that are
available down in the video's
description a belated Merry Christmas
and of course a Happy New Year to all of
you guys out there I hope you're
enjoying the end of 2018 and looking
forward to what's coming up in 2019
