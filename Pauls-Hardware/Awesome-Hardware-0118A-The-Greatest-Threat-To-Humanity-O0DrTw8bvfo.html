Twitter now for no I didn't I didn't
hello youtube hello everyone hello
anyone who's watching us live welcome to
awesome hardware give me give me just a
moment here to show this the show where
the hosts are ready we are always
prepared and ready to go at a moment's
notice
save alright it's cool anyway this is a
show we talk about technology usually
it's based on like computers mostly we
talk without computers we build
computers you do a lot and we're gonna
drink some beer occasionally we might
use some foul language so bear that in
mind we try to keep it you know
appropriate when we are we're only cust
about things we get we get upset about
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific we stream this live show both to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware if you
wanna watch on switch or if you want to
watch on our YouTube channels were
streaming to my channel right now Paul
somewhere and about an hour we'll switch
over to Cal's channel and stream the
second half to his we're on episode 118
right now so you're watching 118 - eh
today we're going to explore among other
things my continued use of the Las Vegas
lower thirds because I made it special
and I'm gonna bring as much life out of
it as possible also the greatest threat
to humanity will be covering that
command yeah and then we have some
random other stuff this this shows gonna
be gonna be casual we're gonna keep
things mellow super easy because
honestly there's not like a ton of tech
news going on right now a lot of the
launches that have happened recently
I've kind of started to die out there
building up to some new ones although
they get 56 didn't did just launched so
I guess I guess that's the thing yeah I
don't know I'm gonna try to get rid of
this hideous Claire on your body I kind
of like the glare it's like yeah
no it's that one there you go yeah just
do shadow puppets it's on Paul's chest
you know it's yeah see it's a tell a
story okay
okay totally blocking man I mean oh wow
that's really brain yeah it is it's
really hot in Southern California right
now we're going through a little bit of
a end of the summer heat wave time it's
about 105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and
it's it's been warm we should have our
conditioner in here for the next 20
minutes at which point we will start to
suffer immensely while Kyle is stacking
boxes it's literally the very top I know
of the window that is housing at chances
that that's gonna fall over zero totally
zero well there I'll tweet it and you
guys can fortunately we live in an area
that's not very earthquake prone okay so
cool if you guys watch our shows and you
like to help support us and buy some
merchandise check that out and do that
if you're interested by stores Paul's
armor down net I've got a bunch of
shirts and some decals we've got
stickers be nice meteors are gonna get
popular again as summer ends and winter
winter is upon us
winter is coming when winters here
should be here soon bigwig tech slash
stores Cal store he's got fitted
spinners some ball caps and also shirts
and and glasses and it's all real high
quality stuff if you buy stuff during
the show we will shout out your name at
the end of the show
it's a lovely tradition everyone enjoys
it
okay let's sort of
into the first part the first segment to
the show which is Las Vegas I've also
just realized that I haven't tweeted an
I should tweet that segment name always
throws me off even now lots of legas
anything to do it's it's it's Spanish
for the Vegas Vegas moly but relevant so
I think I've been using this mainly to
talk about AMD's Vegas stuff and it's
it's out now it's not as exciting as
some people were we're hoping it would
be the performance isn't quite as much
as people were hoping it would be
overpriced because of Bitcoin mining but
we're gonna continue to explore this and
there's a little bit more information to
come out over the past week so let's
talk about that let's say once I do this
tweet audio is super low again
apparently and cells calling this just
did it just take off and die I say or
maybe your sound board is just super low
again yeah that sound boards toast is
something something not right with it
okay is there any other way that I could
jack into the
I think setting up a new audio solution
right now is probably not gonna work but
yeah I mean you could just turn it up a
little bit more I'll put the headphones
back on listen okay all right thanks oh
thank you so our moderator cell everyone
he watches the stream until this of its
shitty which I mean it's a transit it's
a period of transition you've only been
moved to your new offices for what a
month never really did this much yeah
yeah I might have been something that
happened to me in the interim or
something like that all right
I realized that I have I have it all
right that's that's better yeah that's
fine let's let's keep going
Thank You Cal Cal just turned it back up
there's everyone who's saying it's fine
it's cuz Kyle just Rebecca I think her
big I assume all right now that we have
started the show off with our
traditional disabilities let's start off
with this story from tweak town from our
friend Anthony who has used his insider
information his poll in the industry to
discover some bit more information than
we have been able to get directly from
AMD about how many actual Vega cards are
out there
according to tweak town over 25,000 is
what they're saying here Anthony got
this information by speaking to an
industry source who doesn't want to be
named now I know how Anthony feels about
sources that don't want to be named but
this article is still there and 25,000
appears to be the number of Radeon rx
Vega graphics cards that AMD is sold in
the past two and a half weeks since
lunch which is
not a small amount but it's not quite
like a huge amount either you know
here's here's here's what I was
comparing this to which was we went to
an AMD Vega and thread Ripper events at
the very end of July about a month ago
now and I'm pretty sure I'm remembering
this correctly I was gonna double-check
with you but you remember them saying
these that that the number of high-end
graphics cards sold per quarter was
about a million yeah I do memory okay
that's that's four across that's nvidia
and AMD so right there talking high-end
graphics cards i didn't I didn't I don't
know what the price cut off they were
using but I'm guessing it's 400 bucks
since that's the price that they
originally said they were gonna sell
Vega 56 for but 25,000 in two and a half
weeks I was doing some math in my head
and I didn't get very far because math
in your head is confusing but there's
about 13 weeks per quarter two and a
half weeks is you know we'll say a
quarter of that amount so that seems
like they should have sold a lot more
like ten times more I mean you gotta you
got to take other things into account
though but in that time period in two
and a half weeks if you can assume that
the million cards per quarter number is
accurate then two and a half weeks would
be about two hundred and fifty thousand
at crank think right I I don't do math
in my head I I don't I don't I don't
 with Mathematica recorder is 13
weeks two and a half weeks is how long
the cards have been out and they sold
twenty five thousand and two and a half
weeks so if we can assume that it's two
hundred fifty thousand per two and a
half week period since that's a quarter
of a quarter and let's assume so does
ten times I was right let's and let's
assume that's the entire market which
includes Nvidia and we also know that
NVIDIA has a pretty substantial amount
of market share right now you can call
that 60 you can call that like 75
percent know that
looked at numbers there was maybe about
a hundred thousand units if we're
calling that hat
even if we're calling it they should be
selling a quarter of the number of the
cards that NVIDIA has been selling that
would be how much is that that'd be
sixty two thousand sixty two thousand
sixty two and a half thousand so it
seems like they're a little short on the
actual number of cards that they need to
produce if they actually want to hit
even a quarter of the amount of market
share that they talked about as far as
what's available at the high ends when
they're talking about selling cards
clearly of a shortage 400 or 500 bucks
yeah I should have that know some of
this math is okay a quarter is 18 weeks
I don't do I don't do math on your half
of the show I've seen weeks those do
matters 52 weeks in a year and 52
divided by four is thirteen true right
are you sure there's 52 weeks new year
yes okay cuz it four times twelve God
well 4 times 12 is 48 but there's more
than revenues every month is that's why
I went with how many weeks in a year not
how many months in a year divided by
it's not same oh it's about 51 weeks
what in a year
you touch yeah 365 days right 365
divided by 7 7 days in a week it's 52 I
don't know why I don't know to use a
calculator all right it's it's see it's
okay if you don't know how to math but
if you don't know how to use a
calculator either you're kind of screwed
yeah so - yes you're right / for a
quarter that is 13 weeks 13 weeks in a
course you're right I'm right about
sanity check all right divide 13 by 4
divide that by 4 you're talking about
three point two five weeks okay so
that's not exactly right there it hasn't
been out for quite a quarter of a
quarter but as we will find out more as
we continue on to our next story in Las
Vegas they're not expecting like tons
more anytime soon or at least according
to the rumor in this Texas net article
basically taiwan's digi times which is
the
periodical I don't was enough periodical
there's a website they cover the tech
news and that kind of thing they talked
to upstream supply chain sources and
upstream supply chain sources have told
them that due to technical difficulties
there's an insufficient amount of and
and sufficient couple that an
insufficient supply insufficient supply
as it's so difficult say the words of
components for AMD Radeon rx Vega GPUs
there's some perhaps it's not exactly
clear what specific components they talk
about or what specific issues are
talking about is what's maybe limiting
the supply here but some sources say
that it's the process of integrating the
high bandwidth memory the HBM to memory
and the GPU because it has significantly
raised difficulty of the related
packaging process and hence resulted in
low yield rates integrating the HBM into
the GPUs what it was what I should say
there others claim the shortages are due
to technical issues with advanced
semiconductor
Engineering's packaging technology
because these are all disparate
components that come together from
different locations to make each actual
Vega GPU which if you look at is the GPU
dye itself a couple HP m2 memory stacks
they're all installed on a substrate
material ace or advanced semiconductor
engineering receives radian rxt eiga
GPUs that are either that are
manufactured on globalfoundries 14
nanometer FinFET manufacturing process
as well as ATM to memory either from SK
Hynix or Samsung and then they package
them using SI P single inline package
technology and put it all together Andy
says that the current shortage should be
rectified with Vega product expected to
be pushed out in coming days that's not
very specific in coming days is
seemingly the term that they five years
from now yeah I mean the coming days it
leaves a wide range it seems like it's a
very short period of time but you could
say well the coming days six months and
from now is still the coming days from
now the supply chain sources that were
specifically referenced in the article
however say that the limited supply of
Vega GPUs could mean shortages until
October
which is at minimum a month from now
since it's August 29th hmm
I should say it minimum just over a
month from now but there you have it if
you were trying to get a hold of Vega if
you're wondering about the prices are so
high if you're wondering what AMD means
when they say like we have a difficulty
meeting demand it's because there's just
not enough of the Vega cards actually
out there and based on some of this
information it seems like yeah like very
obvious why there everything's
overpriced is because they can't even
get enough cards out there to sell them
to the people who are even willing to
buy them for 100 or 200 bucks more than
the MSRP that they told us it would be
when the reviewers did our reviews but
there it is I will say for those of you
like asking in chat like well why didn't
he just go with Gigi Gigi are 5 or 5 X
instead of HBM - there's a really great
article on gamers Nexus on Y AMD sort of
had to use HBM - I was going to talk
about on my half the show but I ran out
of time so I don't opportunity I don't
have time to actually talk about it but
you should go look at that article
because it looks really interesting and
everything they do is also so quick plug
for the show most gamers Nexus article
that we won't be talking about a cow's
position yep but ever go check that out
link for it exists I skimmed a little
bit and it seems it's very interesting
ok alright one final story on this brief
little segment this isn't specifically
as much about Vega but hey I make things
in segments so wait now that's the rum
story that's let's talk about this one
here so we've talked on this on the show
a lot about cryptocurrency mining how it
affects GPU prices and everything there
have been lots of theories about how
video card manufacturers might deal with
this here is one that has just recently
started happening which is a sticker
that NO 3d has been apparently putting
on at least some of their products some
of their GPUs that have been selling
it's specifically a message to warn
cryptocurrency coin miners that they are
possibly warning their warranty if they
use their graphics card for mining and
a big part in this reason is probably
because graphics cards typically aren't
designed to run 24/7
especially not 24/7 under full load but
that is what cryptocurrency miners are
doing they're setting up a mining rig
turning it on I'm letting it run is
there any way for a vendor to verify
this or to enforce this
that's a good question came with like
overclocking and stuff yeah I don't
think so I like I don't think there's
specifically some way that they can look
and be like this was used for
cryptocurrency so yeah guru 3d the
writer of the article specifically
wonders if our may return rates have
gone up as mining has become more
popular
I wanted to phrase that very
specifically because it's a bit of
speculation in the article and we don't
know that our may rates have gone up we
can maybe assume that and I'd be
interested if there's any other like
actual confirmation from a video card
manufacturer if there are may rates have
gotten worse as cryptocurrency and what
mining has become more popular be a cool
graph I'm having difficulty pronouncing
words today
you haven't drink enough that's why
that's a yeah apparently should drink
more but yeah like he'll said how would
I not really even know if the GPU had
been used to mine I theorized you know
how they might do that I mean if you can
if you sell a graphics card that you
know you've produced six months ago and
you sold to a distributor six months ago
and that was probably sold to a customer
five months ago and then they've had it
for five months and then you get it as a
return and it comes in and it's caked
with dust and it looks like you know
it's been through hell could you be like
this was obviously you overused more
than it beyond what its intended use was
probably not even in that situation
where you have like this time frame to
work with there's too many variables and
too many questions like oh maybe it was
just a very dusty environment they used
it in or something like that that's
probably not how this works
and that's probably not why they're
putting these stickers on the boxes
they're probably more specifically doing
this just to put it out there that
they've made a statement that they have
something in writing that says that they
have the rights to refuse your warranty
if you have been using your card for
cryptocurrency mining for most people if
you just bought a card and you're like
well I'm building a gaming rig but I do
mine sometimes because you know my
electricity is cheap or something like
that like am I gonna void my warranty by
mining on my card sometimes probably not
because they probably have no way to do
this or to track that what it's probably
more there for is to prevent large
establish mining operations from abusing
RMA policies and returning large numbers
of cards that they have bought at retail
of that kind of thing and I've
definitely seen this type of thing both
for manufacturers as well as like
retailers where you make a statement you
put something in writing it's not
necessarily something that you can
enforce or go after every single
instance of violation of but because
you've established that and put that in
mining if you have a customer who's like
yeah put that in because I what I sent
you said put it in mining I said in
writing I was just slurring my spell
okay sir trained it I'm slowing my
hearing right but yeah because you said
that then you do have the ability in
certain circumstances to possibly you
know tell a customer who's tried to arm
a three hundred cards in the past month
maybe these cards are being abused or
something like that
I don't know yeah um so yeah I wanted to
point this out just because we've been
kind of covering this topic I'm not
exactly sure how effective this might be
I don't know if this is something that
is gonna catch on and that more video
video card manufacturers are gonna start
doing in case you guys were wondering
this came from reddit and the user
bought an into 3d gtx 1066 gigabyte I
chill x3 v2 and then they got the card
saw the sticker on it posted it to
Reddit and that's how this was picked up
soo there you go it could also just be
more of like a preventative like a
pre-emptive measure right just to
discourage some people who might be sort
of paranoid or more cautious about it to
just right up front like okay I'm just
gonna go with a graphics card that
doesn't have that warning flat out yeah
just just for peace of mind right so I
mean I'm sure that's effective to some
degree and
not so effective to another degree but
you know they do what they can I guess
yeah
but it's at least nice to see some a bit
more direct effort by an onboard
manufacturer to instead of releasing a
BIOS catered for crypto miners yeah yeah
all right let's move on it's a sword
fight fight Cal and I can argue but I
have some pressing to do for today's
sword fight oh so this actually came out
just a little over a week ago but Elon
Musk and I wrote a letter they cam an
open letter him and 115 other experts in
artificial intelligence wrote an open
letter to the United Nations including
Elon Musk as well as like alphabets
artificial intelligence expert Mustafa
Suleiman warning that we should ban
killer robots and killer AI because
they're bad they're evil and as this
article specifically points out and they
did too in the letter that they feel
it's a bigger threat then North Korea
with nukes which I mean we're gonna
argue we're gonna figure this out right
now the article specifically quotes that
lethal autonomous weapons I'm sorry the
letter a quote from a letter lethal
autonomous weapons that's what we're
talking about a weapon that can kill you
and that can do it without any other
input from a person like that like if
the camera that we're looking at right
now could shoot bullets and decide to
kill us right now if the show sucked
maybe that's the future that's probably
that's a little far-fetched that's a
little far-fetched but freaking me out
man it doesn't mean that it's not
something we should discuss it all if
you guys want to be freaked out like
obviously you got to use Terminator 2
Rises the machines because that's what's
happening hopefully they don't look like
that
well they when it becomes you know when
it comes to your front door he doesn't
look like that well this was made by a
machine and they specifically designed
it to be intimidating so looks scary to
people I said hey that's why they
designed
in that death there's several articles
linked in this video's description if
you guys are at all interested in
reading up a little bit more on this but
for instance there are several arms
makers that have been working on
developing and demonstrating even
autonomous weapons the Russian arms
maker the coalition akov group is
developing a suite of fully automated
weapons turret based this one's a little
automated tank look how cute it is it
can look cute
yeah just like little tank rolls up to
you until it blows up your family time
is tank and then it like goes and
explodes your house because you didn't
because you were busy spoke negatively
about the government or something like
that remotely piloted drones that keys
you know drone then this guy this guy's
actually that's a killer robot no this
is professor professor Toby Walsh oh he
says that all militaries are developing
autonomous weapons so obviously this is
something this is an issue and it's been
described as the next leap in warfare
and weaponry so that's a little scary
there was a one a video you want one
which which one
probably this the scary Terminator one
that's it you know you want a t-1000 I
wanted t1000 that is just a guard that
is fiction so you're looking at a
combination here fictional things as
well as actual things that have been
created yes eventually it won't be
fictional eventually t1 thousands will
walk the earth probably probably get
built by that old on there's a video on
his tank he just showed us there's a
video on a probably his father um SGR
one there's a Sam samsung has a nice ad
for their security guard robot see if
you guys want to check this out real
quick the security guard robot is a
turret and it can it shoots web that
shoots bullets and things at people its
autonomous and they're there they're
selling it as a replacement for like
guard towers and stuff like that doesn't
have the limitations of like people with
their you know more
roles and judgment about whether or not
killing other people who's the right
thing or wrong thing why is Samsung
making this because there's a
ton of money and military what military
technology and weaponry
I guess joking how much money government
spend on this type of thing yeah but as
opposed to like are they trying to sink
this technology up with like the Galaxy
s8 or something like that probably like
ordering a strike from your smartphone
type of thing most likely I don't know I
don't know if there's this gry new with
Android or anything like that yes app so
obviously there's some scary stuff going
on such as Samsung's auto turret that's
being developed and but is this actually
the greatest threat to humanity that's
what we're gonna this argue and discuss
right now because it's obviously been
compared to North Korea so we got to
take that into account and we'll see
we'll see what this comes out to now as
threats to humanity go I've tried to
include all the major ones here and
obviously analysts this shirt is this
you know not going to be able to include
everything that's why I've included the
option number four which is that there
are no threats to humanity right now let
me post this in chat so people can go
ahead and vote on that thank yourself
for posting as well in twitch and
whatnot so what do you think what is the
greatest threat to humanity right now we
got killer robots that includes a I we
got North Korea as it does the options
hmm
bear in mind I didn't point this out I
didn't say this specifically a lot of
people already aware North Korea like
yesterday I don't know if it's yesterday
now it's a different time in North Korea
they just shot another ballistic missile
overshot Hokkaido which is the North
northernmost island in Japan
woke up a bunch of people at 6:00 a.m.
with air-raid sirens and warnings that
there is potentially going to be a
missile that might blow up part of their
city where they lived it's just rude
that's kind of that's kind of a dick
move North Korea I mean not yeah no
yeah but then in that case I would say
North Korea is the biggest greatest
threat to humanity
now because you know killer robots
they're getting so advanced these days
that eventually the AI will will reach a
point where the robots can can feel
emotions and they'll they'll acquire
things we've all seen the movies we're
like the stupid robot comes into the
home and starts developing feelings for
one of the characters one of the humans
and then they get attached and then they
try to do it but it doesn't work
anatomically because it's just weird but
that's besides the point the the robot
the killer robots will eventually get so
smart that they sort of become
vulnerable whereas North Koreans will
never have emotions and they will
forever be I'm digging myself North
Korea is gonna personally nuke me first
hey I took a turn not take a turn why
don't you just go all right as a casual
casual episode um I rest my case
all right so Kyle believes it's North
Korea I'm gonna say I have to say killer
robots obviously very scary we've we've
all seen we've all seen turmeric
Terminator and yeah I mean as as as
frivolous as our show is all the time
like and obviously I'm not gonna get too
deep here or anything like that but it
is pretty scary to think that there is
currently being developed machines that
whether it's artificial intelligence or
some sort of advanced algorithm or
something like that that potentially
have the ability to use scanning
technology use whatever ability they
have to look at what's in front of them
and make decisions that could
potentially be a life or death death
situation for a human that's pretty
freaky that's scary I mean obviously
when you come to like Elon Musk's take
on this and everything if you've read up
on any any stuff like that he's very
concerned about the fact that like AI
once it takes off once it starts
learning can go beyond what humans are
capable of doing and you
we've reached the singularity where the
AI intelligence surpasses humanity and
then suddenly you're in a situation
where you're pretty screwed because it's
taken over all the interconnected like
Internet of Things on the in the world
and that kind of thing there's lots of
doomsday scenarios and everything so all
your all the smart homes become death
homes yeah yeah I mean a smartlock you
got a smart lock on your home it'll lock
you inside or in a gas key or it just
shoots you you're smart you're smart the
possible you could shoot yeah I always
wondered why it had a chamber of bullets
inside of it anyway them for that patch
update um I do want to point out that I
that I do know where North Korea is on a
math joke that is as an American that's
something to be proud of okay let's look
at the results of our generalize
North Korea apparently everyone's
freaked out about North Korea Elon Musk
coming in second killer robots people
not a sweet that about I think it's cuz
you brought up having sex with them
people are really yep you really don't
want to condemn the killer robots until
you know for sure whether or not they
might have sex with you instead of
killing you a man having sex with robots
can be very dangerous can't blame anyone
for that I think sex with anything to be
dangerous I mean if you're doing it
right rubber up kids okay let's move on
to the final organized segments of my
half which is gonna be some news again
not a lot of tech stuff going on right
now right now
so here's an article since Tech so
here's an article from TechCrunch I know
this article does relate to us a little
bit because if are you familiar with
h3h3 if you watched any of their hehehe
productions Age 3
yeah I just call him he he I yes Ethan
and HeLa Klein they they they're very
popular youtubers and they have just
recently brought won a legal battle that
they were embroiled in they were sued by
Matt husbands knives Asda what a booth
in Matt house they were they were sued
by Matt Haas after they were posted a
react
video who's that mocking him what whose
madhouse I'm proud to say I have no idea
okay
so who cares about Matt Hoss but the
clients posted video mocking him I you
know maybe it was with good reason maybe
not okay so you're allowed to mock
people on the internet that's part of
the freedom of the internet and being a
person
the lawsuit however focused less on them
mocking him and more on actual copyright
infringement which is where this becomes
more of something that is a larger issue
for more more than just any dispute that
Ethan and HeLa might have had with
Matt's which is that Matt's lawsuit said
they used my video they used my
intellectual property and they
redisplayed it and therefore it's my
steps that they used so whatever as has
his channel done he looks just like some
guy who just does some weird videos okay
well anyway he sued them for copyright
infringement the clients defended for
fair use some other personalities on the
YouTube and Twitter space got involved
DeFranco helped them raise 170 thousand
dollars for their defense via a GoFundMe
campaign he said if they are bullied and
drained of funds because of this
ridiculous lawsuit and or they lose the
case and consider terrible precedent for
other Creators the ruling was somewhat
specific to this case so the judge did
point out some specifics of the case
because whenever there's a lawsuit that
was judgment like this he could
potentially establish precedent are you
watching his videos I I'm just sort of
gauging how he runs his channel and so
far I can see that he disables likes and
dislikes on all this videos ah well that
sucks which is a it might be as a result
of this thing I mean anytime you get
somebody in a situation where they have
a bunch of negative negativity coming at
them from the internet that might be a
challenge I got three years ago i videos
three years several years ago still or
like that okay well yeah I'm sure even
more so now so yeah it's a good ruling
because they said that under fair use
Ethan and Gila were able to make this
they they included commentary they did
not just play the video and sit there
and watch it there was actually
interaction and they added to it which
is what fair use is all about
they used existing material they added
and contributed to it which has made it
different and made it's not just a
recreation of the original material they
didn't replace the original material by
showing it at its entirety or anything
like that therefore the judge upheld
fair use and the judge even called their
method of criticism quintessential which
Ethan said is a huge win for us in the
YouTube community so yeah well this
doesn't necessarily establish precedent
to be a blanket defense for all reaction
videos which is which would be a good
thing we don't want reaction videos in
general to just be like anyone can do it
to anyone but it certainly shows that if
you're doing a reaction video there
needs to be some content added and
reaction videos where it's just someone
sitting there watching someone else's
stuff isn't necessarily going to be
protected by this I guess that's where
you draw the like that's where the line
gets or that's where like the area's
sort of gray right is how much content
needs to be produced around and what
qualifies as enough content because I've
seen reaction videos where the person
who's watching the original video is
literally just sitting there yeah
and that's what would not be fair use
and that well maybe like would be
chuckling good yeah that would be
infringing no you're not you're not
allowed to do that kind of thing good if
your reaction videos aren't all bad some
of them are cancer but yeah I mean
sometimes reaction videos are are well
done I've seen them they can be done
right and when they are done right and
they're contributing more than the
content that they might be using is
probably being used under fair use I'm
gonna do a reaction video to one of your
videos one day I'm feeling like fire up
for Paul's Hardware video and just fill
my self reacting to it to do that just
you dozing off no I'd be I'd be
enthralled okay absolutely captivated by
your charm so much blood where's that
that's unlisted alright
net neutrality we've discussed it
multiple times another trial he
currently is a thing the FCC is
currently considering making net
neutrality not a thing rolling it back
saying net neutrality sucks you have
until tomorrow to post your personal
individual unique to you comments to the
FCC to let them know what you think
about net neutrality you have until
midnight eastern time tomorrow night
that's Wednesday to comments about this
there have been twenty one point nine
million filings so far and this has not
been without controversy as well the FCC
for example has been accused of ignoring
or failing to investigate outages and
immediately following wide publicity of
net neutrality plans such as after John
Oliver first posted his net neutrality
video when the FCC was flooded with
comments and suddenly that website
didn't work anymore and they claimed it
was a DDoS attack or something like that
but did not investigate it provide any
records or any sort of actual evidence
that it was an actual lee das attack
which seems a little sketchy to me
there's also been apparently according
to a lot of people potential massive
abuse of the bulk comment submission
which is an API based function that the
FCC is set up so you can submit comments
in bulk but potentially has been misused
so there's lots of sort of shadiness
going on behind the scenes but that is
no reason at all to not go and make your
voice heard as well deadlines for
initial comments actually passed back in
July and July 17th
the deadline for replies to initial
comments was supposed to pass on August
16th but the FCC extended the deadline
by two weeks to the 30th tomorrow they
were being requested to extend it by
eight weeks but they decided two weeks
was enough Ajit Pi himself the
Commissioner of the FCC says that the
number of comments in favor or against
net neutrality rules is not as important
as the substantive comments that are in
the record which basically means to say
he's not going to just say here's all
the comments that say net neutrality is
good here's all the comments that say
net neutrality is bad one side or the
other wins he's saying it's actually
what the comments say that Matt
which basically means he can interpret
it however he damn well pleases to do
what he wants
since he is a former lawyer for Verizon
which might give him some sort of vested
interest in doing things that are better
for a Verizon and potentially not as
good for consumers anyway though
Ars Technica is a great resource for
this and I've posted the link to their
article in here they have tons of
articles on this topic in general
they're much more well-spoken than I am
so I encourage you to read up on it a
little bit if you want to and basically
the idea is that all of the information
transferred from point A to point B on
the Internet should be treated equally
by the Internet service providers if
you're paying them for a connection to
the Internet that's all you're paying
them for and that they have no right to
block throttle change the speed of
shutdown redirect or do anything like
that with your data packets and that's
the way they've been doing it for the
past couple years since 2015 and it's
been working just fine so they don't
need to change it the only reason
they're going to change it is to help
out Internet service providers which are
mostly really huge companies at least
the big ones are really huge companies
that are some of the worst rated
companies in the entire nation
everyone hates their internet service
providers it's because typically they
have a monopoly and so they don't give a
 about you or or your opinion of
here your internet or anything like that
yeah I've got enough about that let's
move on to another subject this is
something that I just wanted to briefly
touch on her hurricane former hurricane
Harvey now tropical storm Harvey I don't
want to talk about the weather too much
but Harvey is is causing some absolute
chaos in Texas and I don't have no idea
if any of you guys are watching here are
from Texas but guys we wish you the best
of luck I like since we're not there
with you and able to help I don't know
what all we can do but I will say if you
guys want to donate to the Red Cross
I've put a link in the description Red
Cross specific for donations it's a
hurricane Harvey but a crazy to do that
yeah more than 30,000 people in Houston
across the Gulf Coast are likely to seek
temporary shelter as Harvey continues to
drain drenched parts of Texas at
Louisiana parts of Harris County have
seen 30 inches of rain an additional 15
to 25 inches are still on the ray and
the way it's not like Matt super high
winds or anything like that there the
the damaging effects of Harvey it's that
it has soaked up all this moisture and
everything from the Gulf from the Gulf
and it's just parked itself over the
Houston area and it's just sitting there
dumping rain over and over again so
there's been an insane amount already
and there this map here on the right
shows in the next five days areas
towards the center of the SAR storm
especially right Houston are still
expected to see like 20 more inches so
it's absolutely crazy and if you guys
aren't following this at all
just just be aware that there's crazy
flooding flowing going out I haven't
seen any and if you cannot if you cannot
help yourself physically then donation
to the Red Cross is very helpful and
yeah it's crazy right now
because anyone died nine people have
died so far geez
13 million people from Houston to New
Orleans are under flood watches and
warnings and yeah Harvey has in many
ways turned South East Texas into an
inland lake the size of Lake Michigan so
it's pretty crazy
thank you to anyone who's helped so far
especially those who have opened their
homes to those in need
anyone who's fleeing the effects of
Harvey it's pretty crazy so I would they
give such a cute name to such a lethal
because there's a or they're going to
cycle they're alphabetical so all the
names all the names are predetermined
and it's just they go from H to so when
they get back to H will it be Harvey
again or will be like now they change
Hendricks okay
yeah and they change over time but yeah
oh and the puppies yeah there's tons of
issues with puppies with yeah yeah I
mean because people evacuate and you
know they're not sure if they can't even
take their pets so the pets are often
left behind so that sucks too it's
pretty crazy but yeah our hearts are
with you if you're in texas and
guys I encourage you to donate to the
Red Cross because they do really good
work yeah that's all I have for my half
of the show at least as far as planned
stuff we're gonna quickly answer some
questions that maybe have come in as we
have been talking here I have been
signed out that's odd
conspiracy refresh that well you can
pull up the questions on your oh yeah
it's that time again
let's talk about your donations thank
you guys so much for donating first off
yay we'll go ahead and read all the
comments you've attached to them
starting with Scott Dilbeck Scott you're
a regular contributor to the show thanks
so much for the twelve dollar donation
missed the live stream last week guy
Paul finished the htpc already and Kyle
if not going to put me up in my PC tell
me my rig is sweet Eureka sweet earring
sweet super sweet Scott El Jefe reviews
five dollars stuck at work 14-hour
shifts this week are brutal damn drink
of beer from you guys cheers from El
Jefe el jefe cheers to you sir his I
haven't get through the day man you can

see you at the end of the tunnel yep
kongu 1 2 3 $10 hey guys do you have a
preferred controller for the PC if any
lot of you guys looking forward to the
studio tour yes coming soon and arctic
panther respectively oh yeah cheers um
my xbox one controller yeah even an Xbox
360 controller yeah you if you're
looking for something that really gets
the job done just fine and won't cost
quite as much an Xbox 360 controller is
is a really good option works perfectly
with the with Windows mm-hmm Xbox one
controller is nice too I think it's a
little bit fancier but um you know you
can get away with a 60 controller too I
think
yep just fine and the wireless receivers
for them are pretty cool too if you if
you can set up a wireless situation yeah
they're especially great for HTTP sees
and my htpc I will be continued to work
on brazen oh yeah an arctic panther all
the EK stuff just came in recently so
you
pretty good - beautiful automatic motor
automatic met $5 some money towards
fixing the audio fund did I audio fixes
in air conditioning everyone thank you
very much automatic Matic AC is
definitely off now it's yep starting to
get warmer it's trying to get warmer um
I did just get a bunch of these nice LED
I get a bit like a big LED kit that's
like a three light LED kit okay I've
been using the same like cowboy studio
like kit that I got like I don't know me
two four or five years ago that's all
I've got
that's the same kit that I've been using
for the last four or five years I
finally got a huge lighting upgrade so
the nice thing about the LED kits is if
they don't heat up quite as much as the
tungsten lights do actually I need
really nice ladies pretty soon too and
I'm hopefully gonna get a fan bigger
than that one in here soon enough
hopefully bye I was expecting to be a
lot more prepared for this show
well the next time that you that we
wouldn't do the show here because you
guys had noticed we were actually here
twice in a row two weeks in a row
generally we switch off but I had Paul
throwing everything in decay had Paul
come to meet me today because I had to
like wait for a shipment from FedEx and
stuff but hopefully in two weeks from
now when we're back here it'll be at
least Paul and I will be more
comfortable and things we set up a bit
more and it'll prove to be a better show
but thank you very much automatic man
thanks man I appreciate it
geared Inc for the 10 bucks have some
beer on me I'm a baby tech youtuber
thanks for all you guys do and inspiring
me to do it my question is do you think
due to the fact mining is so lucrative
GPU shortages will last into 2018 I
think that's really just going to depend
on the crypto the crypto currency I
don't know market and really how the how
the values shift I mean if we see you
know another explosion where aetherium
goes back up to where it was like a
month or two ago a couple months ago
then we could easily be in another
continue the the GPU is isolation
there's like a balance between the price
of the cryptocurrency and how difficulty
how difficult it is to mine it with any
given
GPU and that's scaled pretty well with
aetherium difficulties suppose shred
continued to increase as as it is
continued to mine and as people continue
to mine it so if the price continues to
go up then yeah but yeah it's really
it's really difficult to say it's one of
those market things that is if you're
really good at predicting that you can
make lots of money I'm not alright Fred
rants ten dollar donation thank you very
much sir
funds for them to purchase a calculator
we have calculators apps we can use
later
yeah in the maths at the beginning of
episode was pretty pretty bad yep sorry
serpent XS f $5 thank you so much beer
and coming new places coming together
cap woo today this is it really I just
put a bunch of crap back well now that
you've got that stack of boxes blocking
the sunlight that's yeah it's really
it's made some improvements Joe Jenko
Joe $50 yeah holy bucks man you get you
get a purple you get a little a
highlight that's a cool waited a while
to get my double Johnson this is overdue
for all the times I wanted to send some
love for all the great content might try
that might try to send some local brews
from down here in Florida in the future
oh please do I think I'd love to try out
some new craft crews from Florida from
the floor idea thank you very much Joe
Thank You Luke Flippo ten dollar
donation just to tell us balls
well balls to you sir beautiful Tim
Brooks me to $7 building a thread Ripper
server do you know if I max out the RAM
if I have to if I have to use lower
speed memory if he maxes out the RAM I
can't speak from personal experience yes
because I have not attempted that on
thread Ripper but in the past yes using
larger quantities of memory using more
dims and that kind of thing usually does
mean you'll have a more difficult time
achieving a higher frequency so that's
why when like Rison first came out you
saw a lot of tests using like two eight
gig sticks running at 30 33
thirty two hundred or something like
that because for gig or for dim
configurations were a lot less stable at
the time as Mike recruit updates come
out and that kind of thing and BIOS
updates come out it can make it you
can't stabilize that but yeah I would
say I would say try to find someone
who's tested that directly rather than
taking our advice but I wouldn't expect
to be able to get the highest speed and
frequency out of memory if you're
stacking the server with and populating
every single dim slot yeah okay
I'm back Matt another five bucks five
bucks what if we want what if we find a
way to enhance humans by fusing our
minds with that of a is the sleeping
humanity forward and removing the risk
of killer a eyes that I would say that
would be a great solution that sounds
like the premise of a movie that starts
out where they show you this new
technique or procedure that they
developed that makes like the perfect
symbiotic human like AI feel like this
movies been cyborgs
you know perfect person but then
everything goes horribly wrong and and
they actually kill everyone's heads
Adnan that's so yeah so yeah I mean
maybe maybe that will happen Matt maybe
that maybe we will have a future with
that type of thing that sounds
terrifying but they might also kill us
all and then the only hurt and the only
people who will be able to stop the
killer a I will be North Korea exactly
maybe North Korea will save us all
that's what they've been developed
reasoning is a program for it yep thank
you very much automatic amends how
health be alpha be five dollars yeah no
comment
thank you out thank you very much sir
Hector Martinez dilatory five dollars
five for you and five dollars for the
Red Cross that's perfect nice I am going
to donate your five dollars that you've
done it to means back to the Red Cross
yeah check out ow
lol five dollars to Vega 64 in crossfire
greater than GT X 1080 should be in
situation
we're in scale yeah it depends on the
customer support and some gains at what
scale and it will be slightly less than
it's an ad mm-hmm and maybe you'll even
on some games that have negative scaling
mm-hmm because that happens sometimes
too yeah yeah Heather Hansen hey it's my
wife hey hey hi Paul hey you bucks for
coming to the office two weeks in a row
German beer any good love wife it is
quite tasty this is like August Finn
they're ronamoon moongeun what that's as
good as a pronunciation I could have
come up we're drinking right now it's
very Learman there's this there's like a
priest or monk I think yeah monks make
really good beer in my experience that's
true
dark beer brewed and bottled in Munich
Germany it's a German browning by August
inner brewery 7.5 percent alcohol by
volume it's it's super super important
I've never seen this beer in my life so
that's why I bought it it's actually
really good it's yes tasty wifey sauce
probably wouldn't enjoy it too much
because she's not a huge fan of like
Belgian style beers this I do I believe
this is sort of a Belgian Brown even
though it's a German beer Trappist the
Trappist monk beer liked it though yeah
I was really good exactly but cool wavy
sauce I hate you Richard you $5 a IO or
Evo 212 current evo o current evo 212 I
570 600 K 5.1 gigahertz 1.3 four volts
73 degrees C load worth the upgrade so
he has a 7600 K that is at five point
one gigahertz at one point three volts
that 73 C under load should he switch
from an Evo to 12 to an AI Oh first left
I am pretty good your amps you have a
very nice overclock 5.1 on a 7600 K is
very solid especially at one point three
volts yeah your temps are fine all that
switching to an AO is gonna do is add a
couple more points of failure or at
least one main one being the pump and
potential leaks which are minimal with
an AO just to be clear but
it is another point of failure and it's
gonna make things run a little bit
cooler but practically speaking it's not
you're probably not going to be over
they'll be able to overclock anymore so
I would say with your setup like you're
fine like just leave that as is for the
life of your 7600 Kay yeah 73c is still
well under t.j.maxx 476 hundred K so at
that point the there's really I mean
unless you unless you really just want
it for the aesthetic you prefer the look
of an arrow in your system you're tired
of looking at that that terrible Evo 212
which isn't even that terrible there's
really not much reason to to upgrade to
upgrade at the temperatures you're
getting Matt and and congrats on your
heavily Bend so how many 600 K yeah that
doesn't ever climb yeah Michael Anthony
$5 donation have you ever built a
hackintosh I can't say that I have no I
haven't either I haven't really had like
a reason to or like a need to yeah I
feel like I've always been sort of just
waiting for that one person who who like
needs the Apple OS or whatever but wants
and build their main reason to go to me
the main reason in my I mean for me
personally at least to do it would be to
try out Final Cut Pro you know but sorry
let's build pure Final Cut Pro hasn't
that I mean like it's this this I've
been curious but it's not been enough
for me to actually do that like I've
always looked at it like Apple makes
it's like challenging to build a
hackintosh you have to do it yep I mean
it's not like impossible or anything
like that it's something super difficult
but you have to jump through more hoops
than you do with just like building a
computer and installing Windows or
installing Linux or something like that
yeah they don't want you to build
hacking Tosh's so I've always been like
okay then I won't use your operating
system since I like to build computers
um but yeah problem with Windows it
wouldn't it would mean and we need the
proper motivation I think to get behind
to actually try it out a little bit more
seriously but I wouldn't rule it out you
see a couple cool hackintosh videos
recently that I saw Oh Dom yeah Dom did
one
dumbs was really good he is a b-roll
master yeah there was one other was so
much porn on that guy
okay Laboon the whale lemundo will I
know five bucks but natt is situ
realized it doesn't have a water block
available what should I do
retailer charges a fee for returns and
it's still unopened if it's unopened try
to contact the real er retailer directly
and say hey it's an opens it's still
sealed I'm returning it as new
can you waive the fee that you charge or
whatever if the retailer's Newegg they
will do that yeah at least in my used to
deny experience it I can't speak that
it's been several years but I'm yeah if
not I don't know I mean it's sealed you
might be able to sell it or whatever
also double check what um PCB that has
cuz 1080 is c2 does that have a custom
piece be made if it's not a custom PCB
it might just be the standard founders
edition in PCB and you might be able to
just use that so I would have a double
check that - yeah the EVGA in particular
has a pretty good array of water blocks
available - for their cards in my
experience okay few more donations
crits for calvary $5 donation nee howdy
neha do
Nihao nee howdy I get it that's like a
Chinese a Western Chinese tell you
should do two reaction videos to the
teaching wifey sauce well drunk video
one with a reaction and one with hers
that'd be kind of interesting to read to
revisit that's a that's a classic video
on your channel I think both of us in
the same room reacting to it at the same
time yeah and a funny you can do that
especially if like I was drunk again
yeah they're in the reaction video drunk
have been on that bottle of basil Hayden
yeah thanks Chris thank you very much
yeah one random person with 50 knocks I
have a 77 ok 4.7 Gege it's GT X 1080
would you go for 1440p 444 Hertz or 4k
60 40 40 yeah like the 14 1441
Hertz because 4k it's nice the
resolution is nice but some secrets is
kind of limiting yeah
when you guys 244 yeah I creep Aryan
those two directly have it up for the
slightly lower resolution but better
refresh rate yep
federal barn Hearst five bucks Kyle how
many weeks and a leap year highs thanks
for all the work to keep the Greek the
geek nation happy
well Greeks to that as I should
how many weeks in the leap year cap the
same same number right no yes it's the
same number it's a trick question it's a
stupid trick question it's just one more
day is one more day in Italy yeah so
it's the same number of weeks
I mean maybe like point it would be like
0.1 something weeks one it'd be 1/7 more
