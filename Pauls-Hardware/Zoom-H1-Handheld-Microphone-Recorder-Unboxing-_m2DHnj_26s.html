back to Pauls hardware please pay no
attention to the massive hardware you
see sitting just to my right it's just
there's a test to see how easily
distracted you are today's video is
actually going to be an unboxing and
overview of this zoom h1 handy recorder
now for starters I need to give proper
credit for this recommendation here
because it came from none other than
elric Faris guys probably know him from
his tech of tomorrow YouTube channel
apart from all of his knowledge about
computers and whatnot he also has done a
fair amount of audio creation and
recording in the past so he recommended
this this recorder for me to use as a
microphone it's one that he's is when
he's doing his videos and it's got
really good sound and it's pretty
versatile so I'm already liking it just
going over the features that I see on
the box and I should also mention since
he has joined our newegg TV team he's
there to supplement our team not to
replace anybody that seems to come up
quite frequently and he's not a place
than anyone he's also there with us and
no one's quitting anyway so let's start
off the closer look at the box here we
can see it's the h1 a handy recorder
brilliant stereo recording now in your
pocket this is version 2 point 0 it's
got a USB connection so you can actually
use it directly as a USB microphone so
in the same way that the blue snowball
mic that I got can simply plug in via
USB but this one has a lot of other
features as well there's a picture of
the recorder itself comes with free
bundled software you get wavelab le7 by
Steinberg so you get some linear audio
editing software there for windows 7 or
Mac that's pretty nice the lad on there
so the model number and UPC on the
bottom now let's take a look at the side
here the zoom h1 handy recorder XY Mike
design captures perfect stereo images
with remarkable depth and clarity you
can see right here it's got sort of
cross firing microphones so you get a
stereo audio signal records wave to
24-bit 96 kilohertz for high resolution
audio mp3 to 320 kilobits per second for
maximum time uses up to 32 gigabyte
micro s
HC cards for maximum recording time so
that's pretty cool future here I can
just drop in something like say this
right here Oh a 32gb microsdhc card and
then I reckon record all of the audio
that's ever existed moving right along
at it's a USB to point out connections
so I'm no need for ESP 3-pointer with an
audio device with sp2 pono should be
plenty fast broadcast wav format
compatible timestamp and track marker on
board reference speaker external mic and
line inputs low cut filter and auto
level setting features built-in mount
for joining to a tripod 10 hours of
continuous life continuous battery life
with one double a battery so pretty
impressive specs there it's on this side
I think it's the same thing on both
sides yes yes it is okay inside the box
we have and included two gigabyte micro
sdhc I'm sorry just micro SD card with
an adapter so you can start recording
right from the get-go pretty tip a
little two gig card right there with the
standard size SD adapter as well you'll
also get information on SD card usage
precautions never had precautions about
an SD card before here's the handy
recorder system software version history
so there's one point oh there's also
version 2 point 0 which has some updates
information about installing your
wavelab le7 software cool i guess it's
just included on the device maybe oh
yeah tickets already it actually ships
pre-installed all right and here's your
actual quick start guide there so
walkthrough of the functions so if this
is a little blown out guys but if we can
read a little bit setting the date and
time adjusting the input levels setting
the recording format play adding track
marks I like and stuff and we're into
information of course from zoom one year
alright so one year warranty also for
this device from samson
I didn't realize this was made by
Sampson does it say Sampson anywhere in
the box designed by zoom in Japan you're
their partner company apart from all
that you do get a battery she's just
really seriously in there okay that's it
for the packaging so battery included
yourself up and running just takes a
single double a and then the recorder
itself which is that's plastic alright
so there's the zoom h1 handy recorder so
if you're at the top you can see the two
microphones again stereo so they're both
firing in either direction we have some
we have a low cut filter auto levels
recording format between wav and mp3 so
just to switch right on there you can
switch it back and forth wave for better
quality mp3 for more recording time here
is the battery compartment down the back
pretty straightforward here's your micro
sdhc card slot right there so you can
drop in what I will be using is I'm not
sure if I actually use that 32 gig
because that's pretty overkill I think I
have a four gig lying around somewhere
alright so here's some of the cool
features i really like about this a
headphone line out so if you are using
this for to use non synchronous sound so
if i'm recording separately from what
i'm recording on the camera for example
i can plug in a headphone right there to
actually monitor that volume knob also
write their rocker i should say
available then over on this side we also
have a line in Jack you'll notice
they're gold-plated so I can take a
higher quality microphone for example or
handheld mic plug it in right there and
then use this for handheld recording
here's where you can adjust your input
levels here's playback stuff for play
and pause fast-forward and rewind also
trash to throw away audio clips and then
pretty standard power button right there
so slide that way to turn it on you can
put it on hold as well so you don't
actually change any settings while
you're recording then of course USB
compatibility so a USB plug right there
a little mini USB jack and you can use
that to plug in directly to your
computer to transfer files or
as previously mentioned you can simply
record directly to your computer using
this as a USB microphone caustic on the
front you got a nice large centralized
record button so easy to hit easy to
find and then also of course you got
your LED readout right there this will
also indicate whether you're recording
just so I've also indicate if you're
peeking if you have your gain your input
gain turned up too high it's also very
small very light so really easy to carry
around pretty versatile microphones so
great recommendation by all right let me
pop in the battery and it says hello all
right an immediate pops up so you can
see if you got your month day year so
you can actually record the times that
you're making your recordings very
useful for sorting if you're doing all
day or something like that and then it's
also telling me there's no card right
now so I need to pop in the card to
actually do anything and there you can
see it's actually got my levels popping
up right there on the left side as well
so you got active noise levels you can
tell how how loud your recordings are
and of course peak which maybe I can get
it to peak yet there you go so if you're
starting to close you get a little peek
blink right there that indicates hey
you're peeking in it's not going to
sound good and that's going to wrap it
up for this video guys once again this
has been my unboxing and overview of the
zoom h1 handy recorder stay tuned for a
future video well but where I'll be
doing an audio test and comparison
between the zoom h1 and the blue
snowball USB microphone thanks again for
watching this video if you'd like to
find more they're available on my pulse
