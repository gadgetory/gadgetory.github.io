weeks ago I had the opportunity to
travel to Germany and I extended that
trip to also visit Austria as well as
the Czech Republic so first off after
leaving Gamescom and you can check out
that blog if you're interested I
traveled and took the train and down to
Salzburg Austria Salzburg is renowned
for its Baroque architecture and it's a
unesco world heritage site was named so
in 1996 also the birthplace of wolfgang
amadeus mozart and the setting for the
musical play and where they filmed much
of The Sound of Music
this blog I just made my weight today
from Cologne Germany to Munich and then
down here to Salzburg I'm in Austria now
it's been a lovely day I took a short
nap and then I woke up to this
they're guys like the apocalypse nice
okay
so we're getting a bit of weather I
guess is what it's come down to first
meal in Austria I got a cheeseburger cuz
I'm gland but Diana got schnitzel so
also my wife's here now
yay animate it so fortunately the
weather got a little bit better from
there but our first major activity was
the sound of music tour where we go and
check out many of the places and
locations where the sound of music was
filmed
look it's the gazebo from I am sixteen
going on seventeen they moved it here in
1991 you can't go outside cuz people
were jumping up and down off of the
benches and injuring themselves no I
don't know why I'm running oh yeah just
where Maria runs along with her her
guitar and her suitcase and jumps up and
down and it's a very important part of
movie character developments among other
things I'm not gonna jump though don't
injured myself
I did States
we actually had a lot of fun on the
sound of music tour it was cool to see a
lot of those locations and Salzburg as
well as the surrounding area is just
incredibly picturesque so lots of fun
but we decided to end the day with some
dinner
accompanied by live musical
entertainment
right a fancy dinner is three courses
and Agatha Mozart for us Mozart was born
in Salisbury
this part here
I was a great action shot
look we got our main entree this is a
cape on which is a male chicken they
castrate and then they fatten it up and
imagine that makes it more delicious
good you should all castrate your
chickens dessert is this geometrically
shaped
semi-frozen birthday and you know what
that's some tartness going on there
the next stop on our tour was Vienna
which was an amazing place again
incredible architecture everywhere
there's just castles and statues
everywhere you might look this was the
seat of power during the height of the
austro-hungarian Empire and here thanks
to a really cool hotel room that was
very centrally located we were able to
wander around view much of the medieval
and Baroque architecture and here we
were promised quite a few fun activities
some Vienna sausages well we had a few
sausages here but there were also many
delicious pastries we checked out the
medieval and Baroque architecture
castles palaces churches are scattered
everywhere you might look West had a
chance to briefly visit the original
home of the world's first
psychotherapist Sigmund Freud which was
interesting because you could still see
like his hat and suitcase where he left
it when he fled the Nazis and we've just
arrived to our room after taking the
Train pretty much across the country
Austria is amazingly beautiful there
were green lush Hills everywhere and
sort of a pastoral landscape and every
once while you'd go by a church or like
a cornfield or something and like the
greenness it was so everything was so
alive and vibrant and everything but
finally got here it's raining a bit we
are expecting rain for today and
tomorrow it's gonna clear up after that
and our room here is just like this is
amazing look look how huge this is
we have so much space in here there's a
here we have a full couch bed of course
we got bathroom in there and then we
even have a balcony look Vienna
they were like pretty close to the
central city area we got a convenient
access to the Burger King down there we
decided since we're in Vienna Austria
that we should get Turkish food yeah
that's a good stuff
we're not going to the hospital is the
Hofburg were charged here in Vienna for
a very long time centuries the dates but
they have a palace which is what I would
do if I was in charge
what we're looking at is basically
cutlery flatware additions and stuffs
that were used by the old imperial thing
wait my white balance is terrible all of
a sudden somewhere up here chamber puffs
yeah that's where really powerful people
to use to do their business it's amazing
from Vienna we did a day trip where we
actually got to ride bicycles along the
Danube in an area that's very famous for
their wineries they specialize in white
wine here and that was also a very cool
day Thanks
this would be ven trusty steed for the
next 7 hours give or take as you can see
I got the shocks up here very high
quality no basket it's ok though
it's a little bit more mellow here than
it is in Vienna proper and I think we're
heading up this direction where there
are wineries for right now while we're
in the city I'm gonna get a ticket if I
do any video while we're riding our
bikes so we'll see in a minute
get the the standard 3 liter 6 liter 9
liter 12 Hey oh hello 15 later on uh
just go for the 18 later out it is it's
bolted to the wall well I just have to
go for one of these exploring finish
line this is it's a really cool town and
we're walking down to the river this is
the den u'b I'm sorry if I'm
mispronouncing that and apparently
shuttle us a lot of cool air out of this
valley which helps them grow good wine
it's awesome apparently when the river
becomes angry it's well sometimes rise
got up to like down here in the twenties
fifties 1897 most recently 2013 almost
matched the highest high-water mark in
2002 which has a special plaque
all right we're told we can eat some
grapes
Oh quick prints look a grape from a
vineyard I imagine this will be much
different than normal grapes very juicy
and there were seeds I wasn't expecting
other than that is very good get ice
cream we get the den you what could be
finer you're checking out of our hotel
in Vienna I want to show you guys this
place because the halls are huge and
then the the elevator is like awesome
it's actually opened a door to get into
it and you can see down elevator all the
way down there and it's it's I kind of
old and janky but we actually kind of
like it yeah Hotel trend Astoria there
it is as it comes up here then you can
open oh I just have to open the door
then we go Paula says this place reminds
him of the shiny it does it's very much
like the shiny and then the final leg of
our journey was to Prague which is in
the Czech Republic it's the historical
capital of Bohemia currently the capital
of the Czech Republic and just an
incredible amount of history here as
well it's often referred to as the Paris
of the east
due to its architecture and rich history
there are more than 10 major museums in
Prague along with numerous theaters
galleries cinemas and other historical
exhibits and we tried to hit as many of
them as we could we made it to our hotel
room and Prague despite trying to get
ripped off by a bunch of shady taxi
drivers charges 35 hero from the train
station it worked out that we actually
got a really cool driver who took us
here and he was very nice and friendly
and this is a room perhaps a bit fancier
and more stylish than what we were
dealing with back in Vienna that view of
the building next door yeah we're really
hungry cuz we haven't had lunch yet so
we're gonna do that now look cookie
Merton apparently you can also buy pot
there I didn't know that was the thing
but there is Lisa Simpson with a head
full a week we've decided to get lunch
here it's a little Moody in there let's
see if Otto can handle the light Jam
oh okay here's the inside adjusted for
the light a little bit better candlelit
and have a medieval theme
I got a skewer something delicious
looking this this is pork my mouth is
watering this smells really good okay
i'ma eat right now nice and full just
wandering Prague a little bit I think
that was my favorite meal I've had on
the trip so far so I really like the
typical I guess Czech dinner which is
meat dumplings cabbage look fancy cheese
honey grapes
it's marmalade set marmalade maybe
marmalade I'm excited about that and I
get up here I got this burger I already
kind of took it apart so it doesn't look
very pretty right now Dianna has prawns
for dessert we have chocolate fondant
fondant fun and this is like a pear
sorbet day and it's gonna do a taste
test
hmm good morning Prague
so Diana found a YouTube channel called
honest guides and she's been watching
them they're based I believe they're
based here in Prague but they do guides
if while going around and stuff in one
of their big recommendations is if you
want to go to the tourist arias to get
there early so it's about 7:00 a.m. and
we're headed to charles bridge it's kind
of number one destination
the only time I've ever seen stuff like
this is when it's been sort of
manufactured by Disney
one of the more sobering stops on our
trip was the Jewish Museum and the
Jewish quarter in Prague you might be
aware that there were a number of Czech
victims of the Holocaust in fact well
over seventy thousand and all of their
names are up on the walls in here it's
again a difficult thing but something I
think that's important to be aware of
and experience so that we can remember
the past
hopefully not repeat those mistakes
if you guys weren't aware franz kafka
was born in prague so there are several
statues to him including this massive
one of his head that sort of shifts
around from side to side it's it's
really cool looking and only vaguely
disturbing
big wet
what is this
what's going on here I'm a little little
freaked out to be honest I don't know
what any of this is what why why why is
it like that all right
we've stepped into black Mary universe I
think we should escape quickly here's an
area known as Lenin's wall where all the
hippies hang out and spray-paint things
usually they're very woke and socially
conscious but you should I should point
out here that Lenin has never actually
visited Prague
this is our hotel the vintage design
hotel sex actually right up the road
from the u.s. embassy where they have
lots of extra security for some reason
but we're tired
you've been out since early this morning
we're gonna take a break
dinner
even a pretty simple with the food here
we had some bread
about the cheese
hey Murphy
some hummus
dinner number two I got sausages and
potatoes then I got the Caesar salad
just keeping it up to date on our
gastronomical adventures and on our
final day in Prague just up the hill
from our hotel was the actual castle
it's the largest castle in the world and
it's still where the seat of power is in
Prague it's where the president lives
the castle itself is pretty cool-looking
and there's several museum exhibits that
lets you walk around and explore and in
the center of it is the st. Vitus
Cathedral which is absolutely insane
again just gothic monastery it's huge it
is an intricate and there are these
stained-glass windows inside and
everywhere that are just gorgeous to
look through what's really cool is from
the outside you can't really see much
but from the inside it's just a burst of
color so I spent quite a bit of time in
here just checking things out and
enjoying the ambience again a huge
benefit to just come in here first thing
in the morning it's like a little I
think it's like 7:30 right now there's
like no people yay we got in we did have
to wait in line there's the cathedral I
guess we got to go into another another
courtyard further in we're doing some
renovations over on this side of the
castle or the usual look look there's
like gargoyles lots of gargoyles
just Diana for scale
right now in old prague castle guessing
this was an exercise room lots of floor
space oh sorry
nope you need to have a license I need
devil I'm art photography sorry guys
right I'm probably risking being
arrested or something but I had to show
you guys they used to do indoor ghosting
here that's called the Knights staircase
over there sleeping Porsches in do
indoor justing that's really cool okay
so we're told this Hall is built
specifically around these walnut
bookcases which were rescued somewhere
else
southern Bohemia I think and we can't
walk in this room because people
breathing I was destroying the frescoes
on the wall so we stand here at a
respectful distance Isis really like
this boat Denis is it this is a cool
boat here and these are all dried
remains of sea creatures that they would
bring back and try to convince people if
they ever see monsters out there sharks
skates over here we have a narwhal tusks
that one in the middle it's just really
cool look and it's all spirally and
stuff but on either side these are whale
penises and I just if you guys got this
far in this video I'm really proud of
you for sticking with it so you can get
a look at the whale penis I had no idea
they were so long and skinny but I guess
they got to be versatile right that's
also dehydrated so who knows maybe maybe
in real life you know or maybe it's just
cold
it'd be cold in this room too I think
I've discovered the origin of meta here
these are called silo teca's and they're
books about foliage or trees but the
book is made out of a tree that the book
is about right so it's got like
clippings and other stuff like that
inside there and then the wood and and
everything and the
so we can actually look on the side and
see like the part of the tree
that the book is described and that's
amazing it's so much better than just
like describing it with words well Ben
is a low tech n that's the word of today
this is the straw Huff Library and this
is where we just were where we saw the
whale penis and everything good times
and one of the final stops on the tour
the alchemists museum where they
celebrate alchemy and all of the things
I thought alchemy was about trying to
make gold out of lesser metals but
apparently it's also about like trying
to big bring humans back from the dead
and growing mushrooms also explosive
glass shards that scatter everywhere
on our last night in Prague we had an
amazing dinner right down by the river
it was a wonderful view and I had wine
and beer and some steak and also the
dessert was this like chocolate cake
thing that was just oh so good
no apricot of apricot not caramel
delicious delicious I've been trick is
to get the ice cream in
most delicious thing I've had for
dessert after that we walked back up to
the hotel and I really enjoyed just
walking through the streets of Prague
late at nights the lighting was really
cool and just people talking and the
architecture very dramatic very romantic
and Joe Joe you're editing Scriven
through video yeah okay what's this this
is just what's outside the friends Kafka
museum pretty normal pretty standard
yeah these are just there's pan much
like the Franz Kafka head statue it
rotates Lua it's kind of does a little
dance
well dance back and forth and probably
the highlight of the trip so far I think
so Joe I recorded this just for you
and anyone watching this video so from
there we made our way back to the
airport's got back on the plane and the
long 11 and a half hour trip back to the
United States actually went by fairly
quickly thankfully and the last step on
any trip like this I got to pick up the
dogs they've been at Petsmart for the
last 10 days or so and they're of course
incredibly happy to see the guys that is
all for this video this has been my
travel vlog of visiting Austria as well
as the Czech Republic thank you so much
for watching I'll be back with normal
tech videos very soon so hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed this one and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
