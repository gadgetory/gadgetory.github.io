you hate those bulky USB 3 motherboard
adapter cables that your case came with
do you have one of those fancy new
motherboards it actually has the new USB
3.1 gen2 connector on it as your case
starting to seem a little bit out of
date now that it doesn't have that type
of plug on it well then you've come to
the right place because in today's video
I'm going to share a little bit more
about this new product or somewhat new
product from Leanne Lee it's a little
adapter cable everyone just can't stop
talking about that's right the name on
everyone's lips is the Lee MEP WIC zero
1 NH 45 the USB 3.1 type C adapter cable
or USB 3.1 gen2 10 gigabits per second
connection and you can add it to your
case maybe so if you happen to purchase
this product and I will put a link to it
in the description down below so check
that out it's pretty much comes with the
cable which is 45 centimeters long 450
millimeters that's where the 45 of the
name comes from but I believe they have
other links of this available as well
comes with a couple screws that will
screw into the metal brackets that is
pre attached to the actual type C side
of the cable and then you get a set of
instructions because this is actually
meant to be an upgrade kit for a Lian Li
case which will work with the PC
zero-one-one series so if you have that
case then you're in luck this is gonna
be super easy there's already a type C
port on it and I got to do is remove the
panel and follow these simple
instructions to basically screw it in
there and everything's already set up
for you use the included screws to mount
it you're good to go but what if you
don't have a Lian Li case because you
don't have a lot of money and they're
expensive or you're allergic to aluminum
er or when people say aluminum instead
of aluminium or that kind of thing what
do you do then then you might have to
sort of hack something together which is
I mean what I'm going to be doing today
I don't to call this to tutorial I am
going to be attempting to add at one of
these ports to my define higher 5 and
I've already started sort of scoping out
things and how it's going to work right
there
but if you don't have this case than I
what I would actually recommend you do
is try to get a piece of metal or
something like that you can actually
mount behind say a plastic a flat
plastic piece in your case so you can
screw through that I recommend about an
eighth inch bit for that you just screw
right through that metal right through
the case and then you can pretty much
use those included screws to mount there
and then you're just gonna have to do
what I'm gonna be doing which is to sort
of mill out your own oval space for the
USB type-c plug on there anyway if you
don't have a piece of metal or if you're
like me and you just want to do things
crazy maybe well here's what I've
decided to do I'm gonna do the wedge it
up in the corner method it's just like
the only place I've discovered that as
up here on the i/o and the definer five
because I just remove this piece right
here that's for the audio and the last
switch for the fan controller but I'm
gonna try to wedge this up here so
because of that I think there's actually
going to be enough support to keep it in
place even without going through metal
but I'll come back to that when I when I
get to be hopefully meeting me actually
getting this to work method but so if
you're gonna do that if Christian a lot
of screwdriver I'm sorry a drill if you
want to make things clean going through
metal I'd recommend a bit that is
specifically made for drilling through
metal which I have my metal bits I put
some blue tape on to distinguish them
I'm also gonna be using some exacto work
at least for the plastic to cut that
away a little bit at a time and try to
do it carefully I have a kit for that so
some nice sharp blades in there and then
I included a file here not because I'm
gonna use this file because it's not
small enough but if you happen to have
mini files or a mini file set then you
should probably go ahead and use that
that's gonna be your best bet I don't
have that so I'm just gonna kind of make
do and we're gonna see what happens now
taking a closer look at the cable itself
the actual type-c plug side we can see
the metal type C plug it's a very nice
and sturdy one note that it protrudes a
little bit beyond where the metal
mounting
Brackett would actually go so if you are
using that bear that in mind but that
does give a little space if you want it
to stick through say a millimeter or two
of plastic in order to be exposed on the
outside of your case the bracket is
attached with two screws and I'm going
to be removing that and actually
possibly shaving off a little bit of the
side here so I can sort of wedge it into
that space that I have them on my case
on the other side we have the actual
magical USB 3.1 gen2 motherboard
connector and this was the one that was
developed by some motherboard
manufacturers and some case
manufacturers I believe Asus was the one
who started this but we're seeing on
other motherboards too now if you look
closer at it it's actually not
symmetrical I thought that it was
flippable kind of like the USBC type the
type-c connector side is however that is
not the case there is one little corner
of it that's a little bit fatter so it
doesn't need to be positioned in one
specific way now bear in mind that this
is an L angled or like a ninety degree
angled connector then the way it comes
out of the plug which might mean you
need to sort of take that into
consideration when it comes to your
motherboard so here's the asus strix X
299 - a gaming for example and on this
motherboard the plug is positioned right
here and in this orientation and so if
I'm gonna plug it in it's actually going
up correctly and be going away from the
rest of the motherboard in the direction
I would kind of want it to go however I
have seen other implementations like for
instance this is the gaming m7 the MSI X
299 gaming and seven to be more specific
and this one also has the same connector
on it however this one's positioned
vertically and like I said I originally
thought it was it was flippable and I
was like oh then that'd be fine you can
kind of choose which way you wanted to
go but in this case it's gonna end up
going north
so it might potentially like probably
not but it might conflict with that USB
3.0 connector right there but I mean we
hate that one now anyway so so who
really cares about that but something to
bear in mind and I have seen just
vertical versions of these two rather
than just the 90 degree angled ones so
maybe maybe a lookout for one of those
if your motherboard orientation
it's a little bit more challenging so
here's my front panel and these are all
the front panel connectors this would be
at the top of the case and I'm actually
going to be attempting to add the USBC
plug right there so it won't exactly be
symmetrical with everything else on top
but it will be off here by itself and
it's in a position where I have access
to this actual part of the case now I'm
basically going to drill through this
side once I figure out where I want it
to be a small drill hole and then I will
widen it slowly until hopefully I can
get it to fit in there internally here
there's actually not a whole lot going
on but there is one of the posts here
and that's one of those this is actually
engages with the case when this entire
front panel goes back onto the case so
vertically it's actually going to be
kind of wedged it down against that so
that's why I'm pretty confident I can
set this up and I don't necessarily need
to go through metal I already measured
this inside here when I remove this
other front panel piece here but this is
too tall to fit right there and still
not conflict with the case when it goes
back in so I'm basically going to use my
old Dremel or my cutting tool to cut the
bottom half of this off so it can sink
down in there deeper and then I probably
can't trim too much this side so I might
actually need to go in here as well and
possibly trim off a little bit of the
side of this post that this screw goes
into and that will be delicate because
that's it I don't I don't want to mess
up that post that I think if I do things
right I can get it I can get it to go
down in there and it should be pretty
snug and then I'll probably just end up
securing it with with with hot with a
hot glue gun and yeah let's see how this
goes
all right I think I am I think I got it
um this took a lot of kind of finesse
and finagling but this is the Scout what
it's looking like right now I've only
just gotten it to actually poke through
the the USBC connector from the inside
right there popped into the little hole
and basically after lining it up at
first making a little mark poke through
with the drill I was using a 3/32 inch
bit in case you're wondering and sorry
that's Imperial that metric and then
beyond that I just I drilled about three
holes started to widen it by either
using the drill bit in there and just
sort of spinning it and avoiding it
further up and down I was using the
sharp little exacto knife bit in here to
kind of trim around the edges try to
make sure things were straight as
straight as I could along this line
right here and then I was also of course
using the Dremel pretty significantly
not the Dremel this is a black &amp;amp; decker
it's it's a rotary tool I guess is what
I should use should be saying because
the trimming down of this piece here was
kind of the most vital and let me see if
I can oh yeah sure that felt that nut
without too much difficulty right there
so this is what this ended up being and
yes it's it's a hack job but it was the
different areas that I needed to trim
down to kind of make sure that it would
wedge in there properly and eventually
everything everything worked and it
actually fits in there really snugly
actually but I meant to do was actually
tested a second ago but I'm gonna pop it
back in
okay so it does it definitely takes some
finagling to get it in there but once I
get it lined up I can push it up so
where it's almost flush with the edge
that I cut out right there
and overall looks fairly clean you know
it's not it's a it's it's almost
completely level as far as I can tell
and the of course actual litmus test is
taking a USB type-c plug Oh get in there
yeah back in yay all right now the last
thing is that this little nub sticking
out right here is almost flush but I
think that's actually gonna help because
that will push up against the case once
I put this back on so let's put this
back on and see how it looks with
everything actually attached to the case
and here's the completed project this by
the way is is my custom modded already
define r5 which is gonna has been used
in an Arctic Panther and is going to be
used in the refresh of that which I'm
working on next all the water cooling
parts are scattered around all over
there
but there is what it looks like finished
project products so there's your front I
oh and I know again we lose a little bit
of the symmetry but check it out just
just dominating the define s with not
only USB 2 and 3.0 but also the USB 3.1
gen2 right there with the type-c
connector I mean be fun to add one there
too but I guess there's not enough
connectors on the motherboard but yeah I
think that looks pretty clean I think
that turned out pretty nice actually
nicer than I was expecting I mean
there's a few scuff marks around there
but overall I got the size right I
believe and I it's like so snug in there
then I don't think I even need like any
glue or anything I think I can just
leave it as is all the other pieces in
there just kind of holding it so it
should be good for plenty of plugs and
unplugs without losing durability all
right hopefully but anyway though guys
that is gonna be all for this video this
has been a quick little demo mod
instructional slash just see what
happens video with the Lian leap ewic 0
1 NH 4 5 the
the builders choice for adding USB 3.1
gen2 type-c connectors to your case if
you have that connector on your
motherboard thanks again for watching it
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed
leave that Grayson with more we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
