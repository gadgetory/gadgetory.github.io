hardware this is a impromptu laptop
repair guide perhaps this is actually a
relative's laptop the screen has stopped
working it's a mid 2010 HP Pavillion and
I've never really worked with this
laptop I've disassembled a few before my
suspicion is that the ribbon cable
possibly connecting the screen to the
motherboard has possibly come loose or
maybe a power cable in there so I'm just
gonna dive in and disassemble this thing
and we'll see if I can get it working
and there you have it guys after all of
my hard work the laptop is exactly the
same as it used to be which is good
because I was able to put it back
together but bad because we still the
same issue there's no picture on the
screen I did find out in my research
that I started to do after I started the
teardown which helps me with the
teardown that there is an ATI graphics
chip the the GPU in there there's a
known fault with it and it does require
desoldering that chip from the
motherboard so that's probably what's
going on with this one however it's not
a total loss I did learn some stuff
about breaking down laptops I've only
done it a few times before and heats
laptops built a little differently it
also gave me a great appreciation for
working with a desktop computer because
swapping parts out or just even
diagnosing what the issue might be is is
a lot easier there I mean I what I was
hoping was that I'd be able to take the
the panel out and check the connection
without doing too much else but actually
in this model I had to completely
disassemble the body even to get at the
screw to remove this front section so
great design work there HP but that's
all for this video I hope you enjoyed it
even though it was ultimately fruitless
but anyway thanks for watching guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
