hardware today's video is called as a
trouble with RGB LEDs and if you think
the trouble with RGB LEDs is that they
exist at all then this video is probably
not for you because I'm not going to be
saying no one should have our GB LEDs in
fact I'm going to be advocating for them
to some degree but also advocating
having the right and proper amount of
control over them so for that purpose I
have some brief demos here to show you
I'm going to explain a little bit more
fundamentally how RGB LEDs actually work
how you can get the best a variety of
different colors out of them by using
motherboard software control or an
actual controller that might be included
within RGB LED kits and then finally a
feature that I believe to my knowledge
so far is exclusive to gigabyte boards
with this current round of G 270 stuff
that's come out which is the addition of
a fifth pin connection for the RGB LED
strips themselves which gives you the
ability to do not just RGB but RGB W
including a specific channel just for
white or RGB UV using that other
specific channel for UV light I'm not a
big fan of UV lighting but some people
are what I do like is being able to get
the actual pure white out of the RGB
LEDs because often when you try to take
motherboard or an RGB LED and set it to
White's you get more of a bluish tone
because what it's actually doing is
using the three diodes that's what LED
stands for is light emitting diode and
every RGB LED has three of them at least
if it's RGB one is red one is green one
is blue so for a more precise
explanation of how these RGB LEDs work
why don't I just plug this one in right
here basically you have a 12 volt
connection and LEDs can operate on
either 12 volts or 5 volts so double
check a lot of most of the motherboards
that have headers on them like this
gigabyte z170 X gaming 7 or or z170 X
gaming 7 actually has the pin outs on
the motherboard and 12 volt connection
some of the kits that you might buy off
of eBay or something like that might be
5 volts so do double check that
now each actual light that's on the
strip and they're spaced out fairly
evenly that's referred to as a 50/50 LED
specifically referring to the size which
is five millimeters by five millimeters
and then each light here actually has
three diodes within it each of those
diodes receives a signal coming down the
cable and that's why there's three other
plugs besides the actual 12-volt signal
coming through and then the three
connections provide data that tells each
little diode how bright to be so you
have actually 256 levels of brightness
from 0 to 255 and that is because the
way computers primarily works is
communicating via bytes a byte is eight
bits so if you've ever adjusted color
using a computer then you might have
been presented with something like the
color wheel the gigabyte has provided
here in the RGB fusion software now the
color wheel allows you to visually just
choose which color you want anything to
be but if you look at the RGB numbers
there you'll notice that there is a
number from 0 to 1 0 to 255 on each one
so again 256 different values that that
can be and by providing a different
level of brightness to the red the green
and the blue outputs those actual diodes
on the LED strip will be brighter or
darker combine those all together and
you will end up with the color so for
instance if we want it all blue we can
have something like that which is 0 0
255 if we want it all red kind of the
same thing as 255 0 0 all green 0 255 0
now you can actually do a little bit of
math here and figure out why these all
are as they should be because because
computers typically communicate in bytes
a byte is 8 bits and each bit can have
two states that it can be at a 0 or 1 so
if you take 2 to the 8th power
indicating each of those separate states
that each bit in a byte can be you end
up with 256 and if you've ever used
computers before you probably do this
number all the time because it is free
complete frequently used as a power of 2
so going back over to our RGB software
here each of those a single byte of data
can be can be transmitted to tell each
diode what color it should be and what
brightness I'm sorry not what color it
should be but what bright message should
be right now what you might be seeing if
you're at least looking at me and what
I'm holding up here is the LED strip
which is blue
and then the motherboard over here which
is actually green so here's just an
example of a little bit of a snafu that
you can get into when you're connecting
RGB LED strips which is it's not
standardized you have again our G and B
but those are sometimes switched
flip-flopped around it's not necessarily
going to cause a huge problem or fire
anything if they get switched
although the 12 volts is of course very
important make sure the 12 volt always
goes into the 12 volt plug but it just
means that the motherboard is trying to
say hey make it green but it's got green
and blue switched around so it ends up
being blue the way you can combat this
is actually via adapters such as this
one that ships with cable mod LEDs that
are made to work with ASUS motherboards
and this actually flips a couple of the
wire leads in there so that the
motherboards output corresponds with the
input that's being expected by the LED
strip now these new LED strips from
cable mod actually has five connection
points again one for the 12 volt that's
just providing power and an RGB and W
and that simply coming out there
controls the other LED and you actually
might notice here these are completely
different LEDs there's actually two 5050
LEDs on the strips that are side-by-side
one is our G B with three diodes in it
and one is just a single strong white
LED which only does white because you
may have noticed if you've ever done
anything with the RGB LED boards in the
past that when you try to represent all
whites which I will attempt to do here
very briefly like so you notice it's not
the same color in fact this has
potentially a little bit of a blue tint
or maybe even a little bit of a green
tint depending on how colorblind you may
or may not be and it just doesn't look
as clean or as bright as it should so
for that reason you can get these strips
which are RGB W and then the software
actually at least in the Advanced
section four gigabytes RGB fusion
software here allows you to go down here
and individually control just the header
that's coming out so one thing you can
do here is actually calibrated which is
pretty useful if you don't have that
little adapter you can tell it that no
the center one should be blue and this
one should be green so flip flop those
around if you're not getting the right
color out of your connected RGB strip
that the motherboard is trying to say
but then here you can also tell it to
enable the white LED as well
which I have turned on you can disable
the white LED so it's just only going to
use the RGB ones if you want more
consistent with consistency like for
example with our motherboard here also
has RGB LEDs on it but no white one so
if we wanted everything to match up
there a little bit more clearly we could
or you can so I'll just do the white or
UV only which is nice if you want have
the versatility is it turn off all the
RGB ones but keep the white ones on just
to have you know if you want a Christmas
time you know white Christmas theme or
something like that you have that
flexibility to be able to do that and
one other thing I noticed as I was
setting up for this is that you can
actually take an RGB LED strip here and
you can connect it up to just the four
pins on the end of this five pin RGB + W
strip and as long as I get that correct
you can actually extend that a little
bit now most RGB strips are going to
have a limitation on how many of these
you can actually baby chain activities I
believe the cable mod strips here are
limited to 3 meters in total so bear
that in mind you can't infinitely
connect these up but it does give you
that option however one caveat here that
I should point out is that again if you
have flipped values like right now it's
trying to be green but this one has the
green and the blue flip-flop so it's
blue instead so it's not always going to
work 100% but I did think that was kind
of fun that you can connect up vocally
stuff they're getting back to the main
point of this video what is the actual
trouble with LEDs that I'm talking about
well the main trouble with RGB LEDs in
my opinion is the fact that although you
can have a wide range of colors up to 16
million if you believe the marketing
hype and yet you can send a signal to
all the RGB LEDs to potentially
represent 16 million different colors or
sixteen point seven million but really
these subtle changes as you adjust face
one level level of brightness on one of
those diodes isn't really that
significant the main issue that I have
though is something that you might have
spotted in the system that I have set up
behind me which is also RGB but is set
to white is that white is never really
white as it should be there's always
sort of some other color bleeding into
it because these LEDs can't display just
like it's
a combination of red green and blue so
it always has kind of a bluish tinge of
potentially a greenish tint now I also
wanted to point out as I am giving some
phrase to gigabyte for including this
capability on their recent most recent
series of z2 70 motherboards I'm also
going to offer some heat because
consistency amongst your lighting in
your case it's probably going to be
important to you if you've at least
taken enough consideration to think I
want make a stability let's peel it up
so consistency with lighting is
important having this connection I think
it's useful in that particular respect
but also a critique where pieces do even
the LEDs on this motherboard itself
aren't necessarily all in uniform with
each other so there's a high light
appear across Oris logo for example
there's one down here by the sign for 3d
there's other LEDs that are scattered
throughout the board now the software if
you go over here to the Advanced section
you can go to the peripheral devices so
not just the main board and controlling
all the individual parts there as well
as the RGB header but also the
peripheral devices that can be connected
up and all synchronized and controlled
with this software so you might notice I
have a gigabytes extreme gaming graphics
card on here
VGA controls also available these are
grayed out because nothing's connected
but you can also have to control for DDR
memory there's RGB DDR memory coming out
CPU fan case keyboard mouse and headset
so you can really synchronize everything
up together the other thing that I
wanted to give them huge props for and
this is a shout out to those of you guys
who are like RGB LEDs suck look at that
single button turns everything off and
that's what I like about the new class
of RGB products that come out at least
in the PC market is you have the ability
to like on a day when you're feeling
happy and and joyful and and you want a
RGB rainbow going throughout your entire
computer you can do that or another days
when you're like you know and I just
need to get some done turn them all
off and you can give yourself a much
more subdued look or maybe just like
when you go to bed at night and every
computer in your room and you want
things to be a little bit darker and not
have a light show going on while you're
trying to sleep but anyway guys that is
going to wrap it up for this video it's
been a learning experience for me as
I've been testing out different
varieties of RGB LEDs my final goal a
little bit further down the line is to
get system setup with the Giga Byte
software the msi software
well as the asus software and get a
little bit more of a comparison but all
of them are being developed sort of on
the fly there's updates to lots of them
but it's nice to see it being a little
bit more featured full-featured a little
bit more fleshed out and yes but anyway
thanks again for watching this video
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it I got
more videos coming up too I'll put some
