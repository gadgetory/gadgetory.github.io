to youtube I believe in you
you should just about be lied to you too
Paul just do the whole intro without
hitting the button I did you just had a
baby you just say that all day every day
that excuse doesn't wear out that card
never perfect I should have been the
male hi everyone welcome to awesome
Hardware again again this is a live show
we talk about technology we stream to
twitch that TV / awesome hardware where
lots of people have been watching and if
you're watching on twitch you see the
whole show including the in-between
parts where I for example think that I'm
live to YouTube even though I'm not and
I do the first several minutes of the
show which I just recently did and now I
get to do it again trying to do the
short version this time alright point
number one seats made you more efficient
wife and I just had a baby
yeah a baby that's wonderful but I'm
also super tired haven't got a lot of
sleep so bear with me there
point number two this is the second half
of episode number hundred and
eighty-seven of awesome hardware so if
you missed the first half it's linked
out of the description that's over in
Cal's channel also we occasionally drink
beer which causes us to belch and also
use the thought language from time to
time okay it's it's our choice to use
the adult language I'm not blaming
blaming the alcohol I am boy mean though
if you don't like that kind of thing
then you should not watch this show
well said what stores stores oh yeah
fire shit if you would like to help
support our channels and you know my
child I mean if my child isn't huge
faculty to further your financial game
you you sick human being she needs new
bulk is free last time I checked well
you have to feed him I have to feed my
wife this is true many things available
on my store Paul sorry
save a life all very high-quality gear
and stuff like that and I hope you enjoy
it if you do buy stuff also Kyle's store
is bit with tech pay latch door hey he
also has many things there which are
also very nice including his brand-new
screw with confident shirt which you can
get and then you can screw with
confidence to stop screwing with
insecurity yeah pick up one of these
shirts today indeed that's exactly what
you should do alright lower thirds
Fiasco this episode I have a loosely
planned show we're also not doing an
after party today I like him loose
apologies for that but we will be doing
some of the stuff we usually do in the
after party during my half so that
should help I was gonna do what is this
again ask the audience there we go oh
yeah you know we we haven't as I was
going through on Cal's half of the show
I was going through some of the old
lower thirds that we have here in our
archives there's there's a really old
lower thirds called ask chat yeah yeah
we had a segment called ask chat and for
some reason we completely forgot about
and then made the segment ask the
audience so different point being
morally perfect but we're doing right
now okay well I have a few stories to
reference we should bring back a cup see
that video what I said we should bring
back ass chat yeah well I mean um I'm
getting sick of ask the audience ask the
audience sounds nicer because it has
more syllables okay make sense so first
off have you guys seen my phone oh look
at my phone this is my phone I have a
phone look at this look it's like the
phone cover for this it's all very it's
very well worn right yeah that's from
where my hand goes you know when I'm
holding it and stuff like that okay this
is an original pixel XL which is just
about three years old now so you have
that case really yes I've been using the
case as well which is still anyway this
is this phone is awesome and I still use
it and I see no real reason to replace
it
except it is getting like three years
old now so I guess that's my excuse for
talking about a phone right now waiting
for that to go somewhere you know it
went somewhere there's a point the 1
plus 7 Pro Kyle the 1 plus 7 you tur you
like phones I do the one one cuss phones
you're really happy with right you like
that I've never used one in my life but
sure you haven't no one plus they seem
cool they they have kind of you know
they give you default Android experience
okay so what Kevin Noah Android yeah and
they tend to be very powerful for for
the cost the prices have gone up they
used to be cheaper but the 1 plus 7 pro
this has a review from CNET they gave it
an eight point eight overall it's fast
it has a neat pop up camera and triple
rear cameras take taking fantastic
pictures and it's 80 bucks less than its
closest Samsung and iPhone rivals bad is
it's heavy it is not rated for water
resistance it does not have wireless
charging or a headphone jack I don't
like the lack of a headphone jack that's
one thing that I do like about my
original pixel no it still has a
headphone jack in there but one of the
things I was most interested in with
with the 1 + 7 which you can see here is
available in a variety of storage
options 256 gigs oh and the RAM changes
as you scale the storage - yes a
national ram and additional storage 1028
gig base model of $670 us or 650 British
pounds 700 bucks 750 bucks for the 256
gig 8 to 5068 storage + 8 gigs of ram in
total 56 gigs
+ 12 gigs of ram respectively mm as well
now one of the things you might notice
here given all the various phones that
have come out with displays look how
uniform this is no not all about no not
uniform quite thin bezel you know
not-not-not
is it curved I mean it doesn't not have
a bezel but
it looks like it's curved but I don't oh
I don't know
yeah kind of pops out so good there but
this thing right here the curve stop it
what's going on I feel like the curve
just makes it easier to accidentally tap
shit I have a galaxy s6 edge I think
with the curve and I just kind of forget
it's there like it doesn't bother me
doesn't anybody dream for me either okay
I'm trying to get to the pop-up camera
where the hell is the stupid picture
damnit damnit CNET it'll pop up
eventually there are 22 photos in this
album one of them is a solution for a
front-facing camera aka selfie cam
selfie cam this is what we're asking the
audience about today okay okay how do
you prefer your phone's front-facing
camera at the front we got a pop-up for
attractable unlike the 1 + 7 Pro notch
or cutout or hole any of those that
takes the screen and put some sort of
little loop thing in it the dirt where
the camera resides or in the bezel mine
I know Cheryl sure bezel at the top
right in there
yeah or of course we have option for for
for people who want it okay question of
course it's a good question yeah that's
why I'm asking people alright so
everyone feel free to respond to that
and we're gonna we're gonna guess your
answers in just a second I said I can't
put on the back dice of kenta-kun 13
because they're talking about a
front-facing camera this this phone has
cameras on the back two three of them in
fact here is triple threat you guys can
vote on that P thank yourself for
posting the link in chat alright so
let's move on and talk about the next
thing oh here I was upset about
something here what's wrong
poor boy what's wrong you big cry-baby
he's cuz everything's a little tilted
now
poor boy all right next door we're gonna
talk about here Amazon they're working
on this robot thing robot they've
testing robots to box up your orders
these machines have the potential to
replace at least 24 jobs at each
location a robot
yeah Wow yeah they can build 600 and 700
boxes per hour and they cut the boxes to
size for the product so like it scans a
product and then it puts it in the box
and stuff like that Wow
they've already installed a handful of
these machines in warehouses near
Seattle Frankfurt Milan Amsterdam and
Manchester
yeah so there's actually a Reuters TV
video on this as well that kind of shows
shows it in action which is which is
kind of interesting to watch
they're like playing real-life factorio
product goes in there building out a
crazy and I click how about I click
anywhere to remove the click anywhere oh
my god what a terrible player Reuters
writers writers um anyway so comparable
machines to you know these people who
are doing the jobs otherwise and there
it is
CMC is the company that actually makes
this system dynamite so yeah anyway so
point being further automation and you
take Amazon one of the you know the
largest retailer in the world now I
believe yeah right they're bigger than
Alibaba
I think so anyway yeah but yeah you know
they're gonna install these in all their
places and you got you got two sides to
this right on one hand you're talking
about menial tasks that can be automated
people doing these tasks can sometimes
suffer from repetitive stress injuries
and stuff like that if this is something
that you can take a machine and make the
machine do then maybe they should at the
same time exam as I'm going to be
replacing much of its warehouse staff
with these types of machines who knows
maybe
he's really do like automation so we'll
see how that goes I guess point being
though whenever I look at a story like
this thought always occurs to me
am I gonna be automated out of a job
soon so we're gonna ask people that
question
I hope so your job be automated soon
that'd be easy
yes possibly never or maybe that already
happened to you feeling lazy let the
bots do it pretty straightforward pretty
straightforward answers say okay we're
gonna roll on to the third question get
all these out there so people can
ruminate upon them this one's a little
bit more serious and relevant as
pertains to we PC users which is a new
intel security flaw which is affecting
cpus as far back as 2008 and which also
affects cpus as recent as the intel 9
set 9000 series
no researchers saying these new MDS
attacks are worse than spectre oh my god
which which is they exploit our IDL a
rogue in-flight data load I'm sorry
that's that's one of them that's one of
what they're called new series of
vulnerabilities our IDL rogue in flight
data load zombie load and fallout these
are all classified as MDS attacks which
is micro architectural data sampling
attacks which are exploiting the the
part like basically how the cpu
microarchitecture works so it's not
something that you can just sort of
patch the researchers recommended like
if you want to not be vulnerable to this
like turnoff hyper-threading which intel
apparently disputes that they say no but
you know that's also kind of a feature
that people tend to want to use with
Intel processors yeah you're paying for
that would kind of suck these have been
known for like a year or so and but
they've been trying to work on how to
fix it in the background how bad are
they are that they range in severity
from low to medium to relatively
significant which is apparently worse
than spec
Derr but not quite as bad as milk as
meltdown yeah so so so this kind of
sucks apparently when it comes to
individual users like at Hoani at home
users if you have a gaming system that's
built on an Intel processor are you or
are you vulnerable to this but chances
are probably yes
and Jared who wrote this Jared Walton
who wrote this article did go and submit
a couple of his systems to a website
that's linked in the article that sort
of tells you your vulnerability to
various attacks including these MDS
attacks and you probably are basically
if you're using an Intel processor that
was manufactured in the last ten years
including the 99 hundred K have there
been any reports of people actually
being affected by it or is it just a
known vulnerability I I the article does
not say that specifically and the fact
that they've been they've known about it
for a while is probably that they're you
know they're they're holding back on
public knowledge about it because once
the public knows there's a certain
amount of people a Bic oh there's an
exploit I I know how to take advantage
of that yeah some degree yeah so are
they gonna do anything about can I do it
it doesn't exactly seem like it and
there might be certain things you can do
to sort of reduce your vulnerability but
chances are this is something that's
more likely going to affect the
performance and servers cloud services
which the article states might see as
much of a 8 to 9 percent performance
drop and implementing the fixes that are
required yeah some data center workloads
can see performance drop 8 to 9 percent
when mitigations there's probably a lot
of money for some companies yes so read
the article if you want to read if you
have more it's linked in the video's
description
oh joy oh wait I'm supposed to ask you
guys a question yes how do you guys
respond to stuff like this
um first when I get beard okay like
anything I'm okay for now we have
reported on stuff like this multiple
times here on the show you probably read
them read about them elsewhere as well
oh one of the things from the story AMD
processors are not affected so there
there's there's your true your true
answer Kyle not by this by the
vulnerability because it's a it's an
attack specifically on the Intel mic
architecture and their vulnerability
within that another point for a team
team read yeah so how do you guys
respond when you hear about stuff like
this do you just sort of like hope you
know well maybe I'm vulnerable but
hopefully nobody's after me in that sort
of way
do you seek out patches or fixes that
are available do you upgrade your
hardware or or are you a black hat and
you take advantage of the
vulnerabilities yourself could be any of
those but anyway let's round this out
for ask the audience this riveting
riveting episode there segments have
passed the audience segments I'm excited
how do you guys prefer your phone's
front-facing camera Kyle what do you
think uh I'm gonna say notch cut out or
hole in the screen I feel like that's
the happy medium here if you put it on
the bezel you're sacrificing valuable
screen real estate if you have a pop-up
retractable one like the 1 + 7 Pro
you're introducing moving parts into
your phone which is more points of
failure the knotch especially the hole
punch which takes up a few just a small
portion of pixels really on the entire
screen it doesn't
bother me nearly as much as the other
two options there the other two real
options there so I'm gonna say hole
punch okay well punch
what's it it's a tough call between
these other two I'm gonna say put it on
the bezel-set I'm gonna say it's okay to
have a bezel only because you don't feel
like our audience is gonna gravitate
towards that all right let's see who's
right sure I'm right Oh barely but most
but I was wrong
apparently front-facing cameras are I
got one Wow Kyle screw the notch the
match has gotten much hate that's kind
of surprising you would choose that but
I mean but I won just because someone
gets a lot of hate doesn't mean it's bad
drink your beer as punishment I feel
like uh huh there have been bad choices
surrounding the notch and that's why the
knotch gets a bad rap but well not just
made some bad decisions - and you
separated notch from hole punch I would
have definitely picked hole punch and
not notch because I don't like the knife
very much thinking would would otherwise
be a uniform screen and and impacting it
in somewhat of a punch is literally like
three millimeter wide circle yeah and if
you wanted to watch full screen video or
you just gonna have a hole in the video
and just be like yeah that's fine no it
doesn't bother me I mean I've never done
it before but I can't imagine it would
bother me more than a full papa
whatever we living in the eighties a
little pop up me-mow robotic yeah gotta
wait for it till I get Bobby a piston
things like it smudges something on the
screen so they're getting a dead pixel
you get imagine that's not intentional
if it's by design it's different than
something that tells something that's
that happened I'm skating you're
otherwise clear view of the screen and
what's being displayed there and it's
you're wrong and stupid yeah I'm gonna
snoop it's a few pixels it's fun you
know as a father smack your father I
feel like how can I fully appreciate
photos of my nude up newborn daughter as
a father with this I can give you some
that's nice there intrusive hole-punch
I'm struck I'm just kidding my views all
about it's all about building character
its character building okay okay
next question
will your job be automated soon under
Yanis this is my least favorite of the
three questions I asked the address I
wrote it all up and I was like is that
it an interesting question and I was
like I was like fucking running at a
time this quick okay you first
possibly but not for a while mmhmm yeah
okay I'm gonna say yes definitely it
feels like it's automated already
everything feels automated after a while
there it my job is special and most
people feeling pretty pretty secure and
yeah yeah what they job security
nah not scared of robots I know
apparently not afraid of their robot
overlords just yet guys you're wrong
hate to break it to you
robots are coming today's your last all
of us alright last question how do you
guys respond to news about major cpu
vulnerabilities I'm usually so busy
these days and there's so many like if I
actually took action on every little
thing that comes out I would never have
time to do anything else all right we
just significantly impact my daily flow
so I feel like I just shake my head move
on hoping it won't impact me cuz most of
the time up until now it hasn't but you
never know I could be totally screwed
tomorrow I really yeah I should have
announcing on the never had trouble with
that is probably not at all doesn't
doesn't make me less vulnerable than
someone who freaks out about it now we
all know how Kyle is handling oh how do
you handle app all right as a father LS
well as a father I go about exploiting
the vulnerabilities
no um Darth Vader father I would say
option B here I mean that's the sensible
thing obviously not everyone's gonna go
and completely replace their their
hardware although apparently if you
believe
all this story you should be buying a MD
stuff I would say seek out patches and
fixes that are available you know do
what you can and mitigate the problem at
least put yourself in a situation that
you're less vulnerable than people who
have done nothing and then you're not as
easy of a target
let's see results are fair enough
Wow yeah lots of people who I appreciate
the honesty here yeah I do
you guys are pretty awesome these I can
tell a lot of people upgrading their
hardware they're not everyone has you
know 15 CPUs behind them we can just
plop into our systems so when you're
like hey usually need it you can get 20
more FPS in that video game that you
play all the time oh oh who for only
$1,200 let me just take my money sell my
firstborn child
okay by titannics hooray all right
that's do you made it through Paul that
made it through oh those just protect
myself that had some planning and yeah
well you know it's all what's up let's
all it tell for me that excuse me now we
get to move on to mail time mail time I
have a new peel box by the way oh you do
yeah I forget what it is it might be on
my youtube channel
I'll check it's a really funny it's kind
of a funny address that's the mail here
I'm gonna try to make sure I'm not
showing any nevermind it's not up yet
nevermind
carol has know if wifey sauce was in
chat she could tell you all right first
mail is from Josh G from dude from
Jersey New Jersey what a pretty pretty
card there it has some that stuff all
right josh says Callan Pole hello guys
we get a full letter here first I'd like
to say thank you thank you thank thank
to you both for your content I'm just
trying to read it read it verbatim here
you're very welcome
individually fan
stick better together you have helped
you have definitely helped me get a
better understanding of computers and
hardware
I'm the computer geek of the household
my parents really helped really need
help when it comes to tech sometimes I
need help too
I do have a few questions I've noticed
the Kyle tends to use stronger PS use
for builds and Paul uses PS use at the
more conservative end of the wattage
scale I know you have to calculate the
power consumption if your hardware to
figure out what why did your PSU should
for proper overhead can I assume that
the 650 gold plus would be alright for
beginners build using mid-range hardware
is there a way to easily figure out what
consumption would be Joshua to answer
your answer your first question I
usually go with 550 watt and 650 watt
power supplies cuz that's where you can
get the best deals and for like I don't
want to give a solid percentage here but
say that eighty ninety percent of people
if you're not dropping a twenty atti in
there or going for a two way graphics
card configuration a 550 watt or even as
more so a 650 watt power supply will
handle anything you throw at it
yeah up to a 500 700 $800 graphics card
and a pretty solid CPU and everything
it's only when you get into the really
high-end desktop stuff that you really
need those higher wattage power supplies
Kyle is on the take from the power
supply companies so he always uses the
higher wattage kind of versions so that
he can sell more it's not rake your
money that's that's that's what his deal
is all right sure yeah I mean it's
pretty but that's pretty much it like
650 watt power supply that you get right
now that's well built and 80 plus gold
or better rated you'll probably be able
to use for the next 5-10 years even as
you upgrade other components in your
build so don't skimp on the price why I
installed one but you don't necessarily
need a thousand watt plus I don't know
what he means because I don't I feel
like I don't use crazy overkill power
supplies all the time I feel like I
usually just use what's on hand which
you know most of my PSU is that I have
in inventory are in the five to seven
hundred dollar range occasionally if
it's a test bench or sometimes a 700
what yeah yeah five seven are expensive
power supplies ease even more even more
selling out China trying to pimp those
high high-dollar power supplies be
blessed adamantium
okay ready company yes for something I
use my tech for rendering rendering and
video editing Paul's recommended using
32 gigs of RAM for such a builds I don't
want to pinch pennies and lose
functionality are they good AMD
supporting motherboards and RAM to use
mid price range of support 32 gigs but
speed would you recommend for AMD any
motherboard that has four dimm slots
will support 32 gigs and I recommends
speed of three thousand three thousand
or faster ideally 3200 is what you want
to aim for specifically with Rison just
make sure it works with your motherboard
how do you feel about Wi-Fi motherboards
can they ever be as fast or and
efficient as wired motherboards Wi-Fi is
super nice Wi-Fi if you're just
connecting to your router and you're
concerned about internet connection is
totally fine
yeah because chances of it dropping are
relatively slim and your internet
connection is probably only gonna be
maximum you know let's say gigabit even
and Wi-Fi is it's perfectly capable
capable of handling that wired
connections faster wired connections
wait I said gigabit like 100 hundred
megabits everybody when I said that but
wired connections for computers in your
home are more useful for if you have a
network set up and you transfer data
between computers Wi-Fi is totally fine
them there's more questions here I may
be misunderstanding kind of
I just explained that do gpus have a
huge effect on rendering that depends on
the software you're using if you're
using software that is cuda enabled for
nvidia graphics cards or OpenCL PSU or
GPU do GPUs have an effect on reading I
thought you should PSU it versus that
depends on your software a lot of
software can take advantage of your GPU
and in that case yes definitely it does
finally what should I use to clean off
thermal paste from an old build with a
microfiber towel work yes it will but
you'll probably mess up that towel I
recommend using paper towels or just
fine
just make sure you clean off lint coffee
filters also a great choice for that
yeah I have a birder aka a person who
watches Birds for pleasure of sport not
hunting or just watching reason I bring
this up is because I would like to know
if you're Kyle know of any bird named or
bird-themed hardware hardware or
companies mythical creatures including
the Phoenix Rock and Thunderbird I'd
like to build a bird themed rig thank
you fall for your help phoenix fucking
grass and be a new foe thank you thank
you for that as well Josh hey data a
Dena has a bird he wants to know if
you're gonna do another mineral oil
build I've never done it but that's fine
you should do a mineral oil ooh can I
practically could be brothers yeah well
there's a pretty special ice I don't
know where you get parts for that though
alright Josh thank you for your letter I
hope we have answered your questions to
some degree oh that's why there's a bird
on the envelope see cuz he's a birder
hey soos tricks has a little owl
that's a raptor that's that's a fun name
for Burt a bird related name Raptor yeah
brand just the name Raptor his Raptor it
means greater prey was he asking for
bird names yes those are several of the
last sentences oh I wish that okay I
kind of trailed off when he said he was
looking for for manufacturer names that
involved birds more mail mail this is
from I from Oregon beautiful
beautiful I know this seems kind of
substantial here know what's going on
do we have yeah if we have questions
there by the way we can say it's wrong
yeah $85 neither cpu GP recommendation
for 1440p 144 Kurt's gaming um let's see
I would go with a well if you can find a
secondhand if you're okay with a
secondhand market a gtx 1070 is a great
choice or you can get an RT x 2060
definitely one of the more affordable
and reasonably priced no mention of
price range are TX 2060 or a tree at RT
x 2070 are 627 TS a lot more money
though yeah and then cpu I mean you can
go on the ride and step risin seven I
would say or if you are trying to get
144 hurts at 1440p then you might
consider going Intel look at Quarry 990
700 K or 9900 K now this is for you
so it's 9500 cable this is for Kyle from
any 600 K mean what forecast that's no
no it's probably a bomb its trip if it's
for me Caleb did you put anything else
in here for me
nope just Kyle that's fine this is mine
is yours Paul no oh come on tech info if
I have any questions
good to know let's see what juicy
contents this contains I wrote you a
letter you wrote me a letter letter K
since signed in blood yes open this on
camera trust me you won't be able to
fake the reaction again and your
reaction will probably be worth filming
ooh interesting you mentioned an idea
you had for hotline 2 which in turn K
mean and I an idea this is that idea I
hope you love it check out at CAF pcs on
instagram if you want to see a few
making of videos I shot and highlighted
as secret project using stories also
wifey sauce is cooler than you because
she's vegan peace
CAF pcs also shout out to Paul thanks
for keeping your p.o box open so Kyle
could still get deliveries that you pick
up and bring oh never mind who didn't
say any of that shit dear Paul sorry
PS congrats on the baby look now it's
not giving him the benefit of the doubt
you then realize there's a second piece
of paper let me know good showed me that
it says poor Paul on it I didn't see it
let me know if there's anything I can
make you I just make PC stuff out of
passion and as a way to express my
creativity okay not at all for profit I
don't expect anything I just love this I
love to support you for entertaining
educating inspiring
hey nice what a nice letter thank ya
feces and I'm sorry I initially said I
like to sleep I'm easily irritable this
is this is kind of a refreshing change
because usually when we get cool stuff a
lot of the time they say don't reveal
yeah so this actually says open on
camera and that he wrote very distinctly
on electrical tape which he just wants
to see his victims burn in a fiery hell
on a livestream I swear if this is like
some sort of bottle prank 2.0 I'll be
very upset see kind of like you did like
this own custom bit with logo on the box
it's very cool all right
you have me and Trina it's got a nice
eighties CAF pcs CAF pcs I'm check them
out on Instagram to see if Caleb
business name or Caleb alright here we
go opening on camera as in no CPU block
are like whoa that's it cover this looks
like an RGB block actually yeah yeah
there's LEDs on the underside but yeah
it's like hollow this is the cover
CPU goes her
okay what is going on case goes her what
is this
it has a battery in there it's a battery
panic to power it yeah lights up see
what this okay can I can i plug this in
on forget all you've to get out of there
any broke I didn't break anything like
it's fine cat feces put all this work in
she's very thoughtful he he sent
something for me too
and now you just got him broken his shit
alright I plugged it in it should be
working is the battery charged I
wouldn't think you don't know how long I
don't know how long it's been there that
you know these things can look there's a
power button here what this is like a
puzzle
I bet okay if it were disappointing him
so much he's like no you're enough to
know I mean do you see any other way
that this could go 60 X in there well oh
right ah I see yeah it's not gonna work
without the CPU so I guess this oh wow
and look it's even custom milled so that
the CPU would fit perfectly in there
uh-huh so this is actually just kind of
like it'd be like a showpiece for the 59
60 X the original hot line to are the
original hot line CPU because I did
mention in several videos that I was
trying to find a place for it whose I
was a decor piece in in that build this
is really nice thank you I I wish I
could light it up on camera for you but
I'll have to figure it out later
well I bet you could you just have to
nut plug it in right once here this guy
okay
this included one of these this is just
an extension what does this button do
it's a little confusing what is this
what are this for up did oh there's a
button there's a button on the thing I
pushed it I pushed it I found it first
I pushed it though there and that's an
RGB display this is crazy the CPU dude
okay I will try to find a place for in
ha line two for this I know it's in your
background for your background display
Oh for the background CPU out right it's
right CPU but it's a the videos I was
talking about mounting the CPU somewhere
in the in the build in in the case of
mine so mainly case that's why maybe
it's thing for that right Oh interesting
some of that to the case that powers of
two that's pretty cool that's super cool
I'll find some application for this
whether it's in hot line - or not thank
you very much sir
well done Caleb thanks Caleb this is one
of the more badet I love custom custom
gifts hey really like you know what I I
couldn't have bought that even if I
wanted it alright very cool two more
things this is from mr. Nix from
Wisconsin mr. Nick okay why is Wisconsin
right yeah I can't think of any other
states there have a WI and Michigan
double double check I I think you're
right what else is there
yeah it's a scam the curse is completely
confident North American Latino our
state's okay let me get this here more
Bell we're at right
mr. nix deer fall I've been a longtime
subscriber pulsar where my favorite
video was my cpu collection I'm an ICP
collection which was that's from
February 2016 and - at 5:29 you seem to
convey extreme regret and selling your
Intel Core i7 920 and therefore to
restore balance to the world I present
you my fully functioning i7 920 in honor
of you receiving it and achieving 1
million subscribers what I sent this
over a month ago that work has been
hectic recently he bought the CPU on
July 27th 2009 he used it with an EVGA
x58 classified motherboard that he did a
Westmere modification to enable the Xeon
59 690 on it oh he got a Xeon 56 94 for
90 bucks on eBay
he had 12 gigs of RAM ocz 3 by 2 gigs
wait that's I had two kits it must have
been two kits of that he had two XFX
Radeon HD 5770 graphics cards in their
corsair HX 1000 power supply and a cool
omastar v8 cpu cooler
I remember the v8 mr. peasley he says he
got nearly nine years three months of 28
days of use out of it and then he
finally built a rise in 27 X 6s 2700 X
system after OS patches for meltdown
inspector drove an incompatibility with
my Westmere mod so he's just giving you
some vulnerability hardware so he was
forced to upgrade because he had done
the Westmere mod in order to use a Xeon
on x58
but patching for meltdown inspector
disabled that worked his system and
that's what he upgraded but it's funny
that we were talking about that earlier
in the show he also says congrats on
becoming a father say hi to Joe hey
shout out to Joe - ought to tell him
that regards mr. Nix oh he says hey
alright cool
he says I can read this just withhold
personal details but I can't say mr. Nix
okay so I think I do get abided by that
that's awesome beautiful minds and
20 mansi's that's my first intel
high-end desktop that was just more
Sandy Bridge right yep
yeah Sandy Bridge was what made me feel
like my i7 920 system which was high-end
desktop was the first thing I looked at
that I was like Oh coz the power
efficiency for Sandy Bridge is really
good yeah and really well what else did
it have like native what else it
overclocked really well of course had
internal use 83 did it have it on
I don't think USB 3 was native at that
point maybe not native but at least
there was a couple other things on the
platform that were that we're real nice
oh x2 60h h.264 encoder right the
integrated graphics and everything yep
alright thank you mister I have one more
package here which I've been very
curious about cuz it says this side up
this is from Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt
all the way from Florida
there's my knife while you open that
j-rod squatters donated five bucks hey
bit what I sent you an email about
pimping my PC under Jared hopefully you
see this and get back George Jr j-rod um
if you want to enter pimp my PC
submissions are on Tuesdays when we are
actually doing that segment I'll put a
tweet out at my Twitter page at bit wit
Kyle if you want to follow me there that
way you don't miss any submission
opportunities but I hope is to follow a
two-hitter follow me on Twitter and
check your check my Twitter on Tuesday
usually around anywhere between you know
1 and 3 p.m. sometimes later from cotton
candy cotton candy hat it's a baby hat I
like it reminds me of lemonade hmm it
reminds me of lemonade this is very soft
pink lemonade
yeah I shouldn't get my dirty hands on
Sara make your baby sick wash your hands
I did but my gosh that is that looks
like some edible shit in a good way
looks like a hot let's a good pie or
something mini pie cherry no no it's a
candle oh it's like disappointed it's a
candle not really yes upside again my
candle though which smells very much
like shape like someone shipped you a
pious that that's ballsy that's pretty
awesome Wow if high candle I do I do
like candle look so lifelike you almost
and when they smell like like pie that's
even better and I got some of my fingers
or even messy like pie of course
dee dee candle calm when fully delicious
candle company
dee dee is any I don't see if there's
like a any written note or anything in
here oh wait yes it's right here okay
perhaps this will explain what do you
got hey Paul cow my name is Jacob I'm
from Orlando Orlando Florida I love your
videos I've watched them since you were
a new ATV back in 2012 old school it's
awesome Jacob Paul's had to build video
from 2012 was when I first built my
build my first gaming PC that was a few
months before cow but who built his
first PC with Sandy Bridge as we were
just mentioning so many callbacks in
this episode it was very very well
planned anyway I want to thank you and
the other youtubers on all the knowledge
and inspiration you've given us viewers
I sent along two candles for both of you
as a gifts because I figured it would
fit very well with awesome Hardware one
candle is a beer mug and the other is a
strawberry pie so here why don't you
once you open that up it's leaking the
pie is made of a hundred percent wax so
the entire thing should burn including
the crust that's pretty that's pretty
cool okay if I remember it the beer mug
lasts 20 hours and the pie lasts 40
hours I got the beer mug for Paul and
the strawberry pie for Kyle so that
actually mine you get four Calloway
pieces I go theme parks very often so I
got these at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay
from their Food and Wine Festival put a
card in the box in case your nurse and
who made them she owns her own candle
business and attends all the festivals
I've sold the candles don't withstand
heat very well so as long as it's kept
close to room temperature it should be
fine normal for the pie to be a little
sticky oh look at that
you could almost drink it that's so fun
so it's a glass in the outside yeah with
the candle your candle in the minute
that's awesome also Paul congrats on the
baby thank you very much for that mom
was making hats for newborn babies so
she gave me one nose mom made that
little baby that's cool I hope you guys
enjoy them and give up the good videos
Cheers Jacob thanks Jacob thank you so
much I appreciate it
Cheers right back at you I'm gonna the
beer itself mm-hmm I'm gonna like that
pie on fire as soon as I get home nice
all right that's all I got for meal cool
moving on to some more donations here
Brian Carlson $9.99 but one of you do a
dual system build sometime soon reasons
why to build one case is to build it in
or one for streamers also what case
would you recommend for a handheld
portable PC bill for starters I might
actually be doing a dual system build
sometime soon with some new hardware
that I can't really talk about too much
right now but yeah maybe maybe later in
2019 might be able to see that so I just
did a dual system build over the past
that's right
how many months now yeah I'll say year
close to the past year yes um but it was
in the Corsair 1000d case Riptide it's
called Riptide if you want to look it up
on my channel pretty long series of
various iterations of that I'm happy to
say that I'm using it like on a regular
basis as my main computer now and it has
a pretty powerful editing and gaming
system in the top and a freenas system
in the bottom on one case practically
speaking dual systems I don't know
I don't know yeah they're hard to
troubleshoot a media it's been working
great for me
I absolutely dread the day something
like I have any kind of hardware failure
in there something like a custom water
cooling it's it's a lot easier to work
with than a lot of custom water-cooled
cases like like like like Panther back
there because it's got rigid tubing
I put quick disconnects everywhere so I
could actually disconnect the tubing to
remove parts if I need to but if the
system and the bottom had issues I'd
have to do you know I'd have to take
part of the system in the top out in
order to get down to it and stuff so I'm
really happy with the build I do have a
sort of back in the back of my mind fear
of when when something might go wrong
with it how that's gonna play out but
right but yeah till that day comes
exactly cool and case we'd recommend for
handheld portable PC build handle um and
we just did the doctors aber century two
of them right there doctor zebra century
2.0 lean lean this way and then also
this dick sorry one of the way thing I
finally picked the names for my giveaway
too by the way that will be announced
tomorrow
nice yeah and then there's the one that
I use the Dan case a for SFX is like
that also very very slim it tend to be
on the expensive side though like
they're they do the well made is
specialty small form-factor systems yeah
cases they're all like 200 bucks or very
precious but they're just so well
designed very well built and you can't
really find alternatives that are that
small not high quality yeah all right
Matt Ragsdale $5 washing since the
Newegg days hey we got an OG of a nice
Matt ayo helped me on numerous build
since along with Linus on NCI xf4
first back respects now a father of two
year old myself wish you the best Paul
Thank You Man
I I will accept your wishes and use them
to great effect because yeah cuz I can
use some some mental fortitude at this
point
Shawn 6.65 $66.50 weeks video do you
think be 350 motherboards will ever get
rise in 3000 chipset one Rises 3,000
support yes yes yeah little will it
support all the rise in 3,000 CPUs that
come out including 12 and 16 core
variants crazy hard to say still
possible I wouldn't be surprised if the
answer there is no and I wouldn't even
be pissed about that yeah I'm happy
enough that they're supporting three
generations and see if you use on the
same motherboard right so so they go
we'll see though maybe they will maybe
they'll say hey if you're running stock
you know drop a 12 core rise in 3000
whatever they gonna call that right in
to be 350 motherboard that'd be cool but
we have to wait and see Oh Mike Mike NB
sixty-seven thirteen dollars and 37
cents cheers Kyle thanks Mike
thank you Mike preciate a man did a q10
Australian yes
Lyle 2020 have a beer on me boys is that
does that mean you want him to run for
president yes if so that is a terrible
idea any elected office clean up but I
will certainly have a beer on you thank
you very much did Q Paul's half Joseph
Tischer $5 for condoms $5 for condoms so
you can get some sleep in a few years
Congrats good idea very thoughtful good
planning this David SJ $20.19 the year
of Paul congratulations to you and Diana
Paul all the things
thank you David Paul the things Paul yes
just Paul the things very popular meme
right now it's trending bazinga x times
over Paul Steve watched your video and
said we may never see you again after
copy Tex
it was a great video left heart ah well
I'm not going to Computex Steve doesn't
know that yes yeah he doesn't I don't
know
well that why he said you people may
never see you you know as much as I
could so if there was anything there
might have been some further discussion
there are things posted that I didn't
catch you know cuz all the other stuff
going on right now but you know
bring it on Steve dude with your stupid
mod Matt just a fun video to make though
I like I like videos when I don't have
to be serious at all me too
Mike once again Mike dollars 37 cents
well here's for your caffeine fund
here's and Congrats mrs. Paul's heart we
do need to restock I'm gonna use that
for some more of the vanilla bean coffee
everyone just said like go you know 30
ounces of Monster Energy to DePaul's me
no I'm out mother just coffee toffee
spice I don't like this I don't like the
energy yeah the best for you Robert five
dollars can you do an in-depth a IO
cooler install video tutorial Robert if
you look at my how to build a computer
video series for 2019 that I did just a
couple months ago I do go into the
all-in-one cooler installation that's
that's part of it I tried to sort of be
inclusive there whatever type of a type
of system you might be putting together
so that would hopefully give you
something to go on there beyond that I
don't know a specific video just on
installing nao
that'd be a decent standalone video as a
tutorial I feel like if I did more
videos per week I ranch out and stuff
like that like little quick little
videos that a lot of our core viewers
know but could also help some new
builders both II okay Jordan Frank
jadon Canadia what's your favorite
implementation of ray-tracing so far I
have not really used rate racing at all
I've only seen demos of it I've reported
on its I've made videos on its but I
have not actually really gained with
rate racing enabled I mean the
battlefield 5 stuff is great it looks
really nice when you actually have when
you actually stop to smell the roses and
you're not trying to fight for your life
you're actually playing the game but
I would say no I would say Metro Exodus
just because I think it is a practical
implementation of ray tracing these ray
trace global illumination so they're not
trying to trace every single ray
everywhere it's bouncing off everything
they're using it for lighting so they
can do that enhance the lighting and
make it look more realistic but not do
like when in battlefield five when you
turn it on more suddenly your your frame
rate tanks horribly it does still affect
it a little bit but um I think that's
just a good example of like a practical
implementation of it right now where you
can see right you can see a benefit and
yeah I mean obviously if you're hanging
the launch of an entire product line
like RTA X on something like that you
know it's not gonna stick because you're
like oh well it's kind of underwhelming
in that respect but I think it shows how
moving forward
game developers kind of have a new tool
in their basket now that they can use
and we'll see more use of in the future
so and it's getting more optimized as
driver driver updates rollout and stuff
which is nice we know some do chief five
dollars you know Bible symbol cancels
out the bolt cancels out cap a therapist
unless your enemy has studied his
Agrippa Koopa which I can grab some
little one time for dead jokes is that
quote from something yes it's the
fencing scene from The Princess Bride uh
I was gonna say that this sounds very
much like a princess bride quote which I
remember that it's it's it's such a
great scene so quotable and I've I
rewrote it I included that scene in part
of a project I did like many years ago
so I wrote out all of the lines that
they say there because the whole because
the man in black right Wesley
right is is fencing against against
inigo montoya
right and their dialogue the whole time
is all about fencing right and if you
don't know what any of the stuff they're
talking about is it kind of goes over
your head
little bit right there sitting there and
and and and apparently like if you're
good at fencing and you watch that scene
like they actually did a ton of studying
for it as well right it's like it kind
of goes along with the whole thing so
he's like okay so as he's fed he's like
I using bananas defense against me yeah
it's like I thought it fitting
considering the rocky terrain and then
it's like it's like naturally you expect
you to attack with Kappa Farah it's like
the Tibble canceled out calves affair
unless your enemy his study he's a group
at which I have yeah so so they actually
do the research they did hone oh that's
nice Princess Bride such a such a good
movie I like that movie so many ways I
still unabashedly love Princess Bride
thank you Guido for catching that
reference I think you're the only one
who has amongst all of the comments and
stuffs that I've read from that video
nice who's Brendan's mom's 50 Norwegian
Crona congratulations but don't tame
your girl to sleep in complete silence
we can watch movies and do anything
while our girl is sleeping psht PC
floatplane good thank you for keeping it
somebody fake CPC and flow playing both
things that I need to do yes we are not
planning on maintaining silence we're
gonna try to keep things at a relative
who's vacuum yeah because apparently
that's thing you know if you're if you
always tiptoeing who do the baby sleep
in tiptoeing around and yes when
something a lot happens they'll wake up
that sure if you just go about business
as usual right and the baby will get
used to sleeping through some noise yeah
that's hopefully how it's gonna work out
for us of course it might not but we'll
see thank you for the they encouraged
with though good luck on that
bazinga X $5 who would you permit to
babysit Kyle
Lyle J Linus or Steve um is there an
option for none of the above
none of us seem like good option do they
all have Tdap vaccinations cuz that's
important that's important for me right
now just boils down to that um I think
Kyle gets it okay okay while I'll
probably not yeah no I don't I don't I
was tend to like try to sell the baby or
something we never babysitting for us J
I think J would be okay has kids yeah
honestly I think I trust any of them but
with Linus would drop it
Linus would drop the babe I mean that's
what he does and he's done that before
but Linus has kids and chattering so
chop them up a little funny if they turn
out a little funny we know why all right
so other than Royal Mellon among that
list Linus is the one who I'd be most
most sort of nervous about but in a
pinch you know I'd still be okay with it
Steve I think would I just well Steve we
try to benchmark your child yeah I don't
know how is this compared to the other
child back there most daughter baby's
not getting enough hair for really not
really underwhelming evolve right and
and that's also true
Yvonne if if if Linus was watching my
daughter Yvonne when I feel like would
have a hand in it sure and and you'd
have wifey sauce - yeah she she's much
better at that or a thing that I
everything all right good question Air
Force four six two seven zero $10 hi
Kyle would you recommend the antec
sleeved extensions or the aysia horse
ones I know you've used both and one to
know your thoughts trying to decide
which is better between the two I think
the Asian horse ones are great if you're
on a super tight budget but just for a
little bit more you get higher quality
sleeving with the Antec which I just
used for the first time for the the most
recent pin my rig episode and they were
pleasantly surprising they have no heat
shrink and none of the sleeving came out
of the connectors it was all very tight
and well formed either shape and overall
I would suggest the Antec if you can
spend you know 10 15 bucks more Matthew
Blankenship $5.00 Congrats Paul Kyle and
thanks measure he's build / unbuild
where one person builds a PC for a
specified time then another person
switches in to undo the work why would
they undo the work though yeah yeah you
need you need some motivation there hmm
what is the we undo the work this
inspired from Jay's how-to
unbuild a PC video so if you're looking
all right so let's let's let's big
picture this right mm-hmm
you've seen Jays new I didn't watch the
whole thing but he's got a new workspace
right that he's building out right much
larger and everything right yeah so
let's say you have unlimited resources
and access to people to come in and be
in the video and everything like that it
would be something like where you have
teams and you have to switch off
building and taking a part but like you
can't you can't break anything AB you
can build build and then just build the
computer first but at certain points
it's switching off and you're having
somebody from the other team come over
and like disassembling your system Oh as
a distraction as kind of like a I don't
know you have to build it out like a
like a like a game show or something and
have some trivia questions involved or
something right that you know I have
like a lightning round yes I have to
have a lightning round anyway I always
thought the idea we had when you were
shut up that was my idea and you don't
talk about that right now because it's
still my idea oh this is all happening I
don't know but I'm maintaining it I'm
maintaining my rights over it okay yeah
I will have Steve our friend Steve Steve
are come here and he will he'll beat the
shit out of you because he was he was so
stoked on that idea you know it's still
good don't give up hope you never know
that would be fun
as a father Brian
Farrah pure fear a German it's your name
you can't knock your name how much of a
price cut would there be would have to
be on a rise in five twenty six hundred
ex to forsake the next gen gonna be
doing meaning mostly hmm
what are those go on for now 2600 X 126
hundreds you could get for 160 165 2x
click around 199 174 175
175 b14 160 that's pretty good that's
that's such a tough call in there cuz
like this there's several little
variables that you have to kind of throw
around and gauge whether it's important
to you or not
like 2,600 comes with the Wraith stealth
2600 X comes with the raid spire so you
get a better cooler with it as well as
higher out of the box frequencies if you
you can save some money get a 2600 an
overclock it to be pretty much on par
with the 2600 X but you don't have as
good of a cooler so you probably needed
to spend more money on a cooler so if
you're gonna get an aftermarket cooler
maybe you should go to 2600 not the 2600
X but then you got this select that 1700
in there and that's got 8 cores and and
16 threads and maybe that's gonna be a
better option of course that's first gen
rise instead of second gen so you can't
get quite as much as high frequencies
out of that so single core performance
is what you're really going at it for
like I could I could I could talk in
circles about the CPU choices in the
like hundred unit 32 $200 range right
from for AMD and it's really hard to say
here's exactly what you should get right
that said 2600 X is probably going to
get you the best single core
out-of-the-box performance because you
have xfr 2.0 which does do a very good
job and can push a single or two cores
up to like 4.1 4.2 gigahertz if you have
adequate cooling and pv 2.0
yes yeah so yeah precision boosts is up
boost is also nice so that's a good CPU
anyway really hard question to just
answer definitive or you can spend 80
bucks for a rise in 1600 at micro Center
which you can also get right now 80 and
yeah
80 bucks oh my gosh it's awesome that's
that's worth exploring man damn but it's
great it's great to have that dilemma at
that yeah the game price ring good
problems to have and to be talking about
Oh 6 cores 12 threads or 8 cores 16
threads right before it was like oh
which four core or two core Intel
variant should I get yeah at that price
right
you know get your options laid out for
you twisted hardware $5.00 I'm late what
was so bad about the Intel security
breach should I switch to Rison hello
well sorry for the caps I don't feel
like rewriting all that um what was so
bad about the Intel security breach well
the fact that you're okay it's a
vulnerability so it could be yet you
know you still have to open yourself up
to it so maintain good internet browsing
practices like not downloading and
running random executables that you're
not familiar with from unknown websites
but the vulnerabilities are so bad that
for example running JavaScript on a
certain page could could compromise your
system you just don't use Java but I
mean there's there's other there's other
things about that so the way I look at
it is how important of a target are you
are that people who are after you
is there somebody who's like twisted
hardware if I can just get into his
computer there's all these glorious
benefits that will that will arise from
that if the answer there is no then you
probably will have less of a concern if
you constantly go around on random
forums and in the like pseudo darker
gray area of the web and insult hackers
and stuff like that then maybe you'd be
a little bit more concerned honestly at
this point it's it's mainly gonna be a
concern if you're an IT professional and
you're talking about data center usage
and how to protect yourself there
because that is where the people who
know what they're doing are going to be
looking because that's where you can get
the if you can compromise systems like
that you can you can get lots of
valuable information out of them
valuable data so yeah chances are you
okay for now yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't
fret too much that maybe you should just
buy an AMD system but maybe there's this
option who knows all right that's
probably the best answer we can give you
for now
we are going to close off this half of
the show for now though thank you guys
