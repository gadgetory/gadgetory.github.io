remodel video part 2 let's start off
with a quick recap of what happened in
part 1 so this is our master bath
ensuite attached to our master bedroom
and the main goals were to replace the
toilets replace the old large and
cumbersome vanity was that was right
there also replaced the mirror get rid
of the shower door and replace it with a
curtain and finally just generally get a
nice paint job in there and improve the
overall look and feel of our bathroom
the goal was to get it done in two days
the two days just prior to Christmas Eve
and unfortunately I failed and the last
day actually I'm Christmas Eve by
punching a hole through one of these
pipes with a baseboard finishing nail we
had a plumber come by to do a patch on
that but the puncture was so low that he
couldn't actually fix it at the time so
he's supposed to come back on Friday in
a couple days to cut a larger piece out
of our nicely repainted drywall so he
can get more access to the pipe and
actually patch it up properly after that
I can patch the drywall we can mount our
vanity we can hopefully install the
toilets but you might notice that our
floors in here are still the old
existing floor so this is what's been
added since we now have more time since
we are not on a time crunch to get this
done before Christmas anymore
we're now just on a time crunch to get
the floor may be redone before the
plumber comes back
alright so using nothing but my hammer
and the chisel of hatred here I have
removed my first tile there it is and I
have learned that the floor seems fairly
level beneath that and I'm not getting a
whole lot of leftover stuff here the
mortar and everything's coming off
pretty easily we already have an
undercut for the door coping here so I
can get a measurement for that before I
go to the hardware store and there also
appears to be some moisture over here
possibly I hope not but we're gonna have
to probably do moisture testing here as
well but I think at least I'm gonna be
able to learn enough here to head to
Home Depot alright here's my home depot
haul I got some quarter-round this is
synthetic and it's waterproof so that
would be good for the bathroom I got
some finishing nails here one and a
quarter inch like eighty percent less
likely to punch through a copper pipe
with those got some cleanup bags I got
buckets because I felt like you know
look it's a good to have floor chisel is
gonna be important for clearing off and
flattening that floor before we apply
the laminate flooring itself which is
right here this is called Peugeot
outlast plus it's vinyl
and we got the vintage pewter oak finish
I also got oh I have a big dog you like
the quarter rounds here Oh I got a
crowbar because it's good to have a
crowbar I got some plastic to put over
furniture because we're gonna make a
little nest I got a rubber mallet cuz I
don't want one of those I got a concrete
fitting so I'm hoping I can use this
with my hammer drill but I could totally
be wrong about that
I got a fancy canvas drop cloth because
I was jealous of my plumbers and I got a
dEWALT's cutting tool let's move on
you
so last night's I was able to tear out
the floor the tile it it all came out it
wasn't too terribly difficult - took me
hour and a half to two hours but today I
had a bunch of other stuff to do so it's
already getting dark outside as I come
back to this but I wanted to point out a
few things before I get back to work one
is that I totally had the wrong type of
flooring before I accidentally had a
laminate flooring oops we switched to
this lifeproof which is vinyl vinyl
which means it's waterproof like on the
top and the bottom because it's not made
of wood it also has the underlayment
pre-attached which is nice so all I
should really have to worry about in
here is a floor that is flat and level
unfortunately is pretty much level and
it's pretty much flat - the towel came
off pretty good for the most part except
over here in the corner where I believe
they might have used some leveling
compound or something like that but
before they install the last floor so I
need to try to get rid of the rest of
the mortar II ridges sticking up along
here which I can hopefully do with my
scraping tool and if I can do that and
get everything flat then the floor will
be ready to put in I don't think that'll
take too long
cuz it's just the tongue and groove
stuff that snaps in the sides and
measuring it won't be too difficult
since this room is pretty square and not
very big will mean about five and a half
by five point seven feet but beyond that
the place that was damp over here has
gotten very dry so I'm pretty sure that
it was the old floor that was causing
issues with leakage there I'm gonna have
the plumber double check that and make
sure it's all good and then of course I
need to leave this a little bit
unfinished over here so he can get it
what he needs to get at under there then
once he finishes that I can patch the
drywall not the vanity install the rest
of the floor and then hopefully by the
time we leave on Saturday which is our
next deadline is we're going out of town
for the weekend on Saturday we will have
a functional bathroom let's see
so here is the floor at least as far
along as I got with it last nights it
was pretty straightforward pretty simple
to install
snapping things in place using a mallet
where necessary to cinch down these
seams and then cutting out the piece
where the toilets passed through was the
most challenging part and for that I
just measured it and cut it out with my
jig saw and I did it twice I did it once
that it was off but then I used that cut
to measure how far off I was and then
the second time I did a lot better so
that's pretty good and pretty stable so
that should be good for mounting a
toilet which we're doing this morning
what's the plumber gets here and then of
course the final fix on the wall and the
leak back there patched that up and move
on with everything else the interest of
keeping things waterproof we're
switching from this filler wood based
molding to this stuff which is synthetic
so it's waterproof and it is a little
bit more expensive but since we don't
need a whole lot of it in the bathroom I
think it's gonna be a better job this is
the baseboard that got wet when I punch
through that pipe in part one you'll
note some slight warpage part of the
reason why I went with synthetic
so the warpage on that baseboard kind of
freaked me out and I've got some more
draw what I'm putting in as I've already
been showing so given this a quick sand
and then I just picked up some clear
polyurethane so hopefully have time to
do a couple coats of this to make sure
this is moisture resistant or moisture
it's a saturday now well guys we are
officially at the one weak point in this
project this two-day project the plumber
came yesterday but he arrived kind of
late because he had an earlier job that
took a lot of time so unfortunately
after he cut the wall away here he
decided he was probably going to need to
come back today so this morning let me
show you what's going on in wall here so
here's where I punched a hole and that's
what needs to be patched in the fact
that it's so low to the concrete here
meant that he needed to get some extra
space in order to work with the pipe in
order to get it fixed when he tore the
wall away though he found that there's a
manifold here and split off to go up to
the actual supply line over there and
then there's another one that goes back
down into something else under the
concrete
long story short though he needs to
replace this entire perch in order to
get that part to fix the hole that I
made which sucks but what I have this
done right our plumbers name is Enrique
and he does a really good job he's very
thorough and does things the right way I
have done a little bit of soldering but
I am not comfortable enough to work with
something like this I don't even have a
torch for it so when it comes to
something that's going to be in our wall
and that we're gonna be relying on for
plumbing we want to make sure it's done
right so and then everything else is
pretty much prepped to go so we can
hopefully just go bang bang bang install
everything and then we get to leave for
the weekend so cool new pipes installed
we're gonna leak tests now oh that's how
it was still I um plus say nothing's
leaking there we are moving on with the
toilet installation like that double
whacks we have a new toilet hooray it's
all still all everything's working we
gotta wait a few hours to sit on it cuz
okay wait for the seal at the bottom to
cure the day is also installed and I
wanted to point out something about this
toilet if you're shopping for a toilet
I made me consider the single piece one
we like that because there's no joint
there to get all messy and then the
second thing is being able to reach
under right here to get at the mounting
points for the actual toilet seat
because if you ever want to remove this
to install the day or to remove the
toilet seat to give it a full cleaning
you definitely don't want one like we
had before which you can only get out by
like reaching through the back and so
it's the toilets position of anywhere
where you can't do that then you have to
pull it off in order to do that and
that's that's really kind of a pain in
the butt let's move on though switching
to drywall mode now I'll ace head was
quarter sheets of drywall and this is
half inch thickness which is a little
bit thinner than existing drywall so I'm
going to need to leave this up a little
bit so I can get that flush
oh yeah before I close this up I'm going
to take some very important pictures and
that should be invaluable in the future
whether I'm trying to find exactly where
the studs are or trying to avoid this
stuff so looking about this piece and as
mentioned I need to space it off a
little bit from the stud here and I'm
gonna use this getter method
you're gonna need to cut these last two
pieces and in order to do that I
measured the wall actually first I
measured and I was gonna cut them all
the same length then I realize this wall
is not straight or at least it's not
90-degree parallel or perpendicular ever
it's it's not straight so I measured
width there and I'm got it there and
then I measured width here and I marked
it there also marked it on this one cuz
this is gonna be the last piece and then
I measured the final width there marked
it around there so I can cut these at a
slight angle with my jigsaw and then
they should fit
suddenly the vanity is installed exactly
we blocked it up mostly level we're just
getting a height test right now so we
make sure it's low enough cuz the other
one was way too high but we're not gonna
Center it under the lights it's only
issue is that outlet right here but
we're gonna put the mirror directly
above that at this point we've decided
if we're not happy with it we'll we'll
fix it in a couple of years or something
then I got a measure to cut a piece out
of the lower piece of wood to make room
for the wet works down there
we'll pull it off start mounting stuff a
rough sketch of the notch I need to cut
out will test fit here and I think we
barely barely have enough clearance with
the drawer pretty much all the way in
ooh look at that I think we can move on
just discovered my lovely wife
discovered fortunately early this well
relatively early this horrible conflict
which is at the back the sink has these
pieces right here which stick down
unfortunately conflict with this back
piece so I have outlined where I can cut
this let the sink will still go there
and here's a solution I've cut this wood
backer piece one more time
I made some notches along the side cut a
bit off the top and have resealed it
once again with three more layers of
polyurethane
there it is
my unique mounting method for the IKEA
God Morgon Benny I can put the top I and
get the plumbing
so everything is plumbed up down here I
have connected water lines and
everything pretty much straight up here
and your grass no leaks no media leaks
time to install this mirror so this
mirror is almost square it's a little
bit of a rectangle they want you to
mount it at six points they do not give
you screws they do give you these
mounting things - this one is for the
top this one's for the bottom
Aamir's 39 inches wide they want you to
put these in about two to four inches
and fortunately you have a 16 inch
separation between our stud there you
can put one two three four five six and
mount directly to the studs to do that
I'm going to be using some two and a
half inch construction screws again this
is wave overkill I put my first hole in
the center stud and then they use my
long level here to get some lines down
for the left one and the right one
so now that we got our bottom row we
just need to measure up the wall 36 and
8 sixteenths of an inch or a top row by
the way just a tip here IKEA 8/16 is a
half 36 and a half inches it's a tape on
my long level of 36 and a half inches
but I was trusting the IKEA instructions
that this would work once they're all
installed it was only after getting
these tough ones in that I actually
figured it out but stop in first and
then these fish up a little bit they're
spring-loaded
so then we can pop the bottom edge into
the bottom ones
all right guys this is getting really
really close as you can see we got the
mirror installed and then I was a pretty
late last night doing some caulking
around the baseboards after those were
all nailed in fortunately they were
nailed in without any further burst
pipes I am so happy about that my wife
has been doing some shopping for some
accessories to match things up and
really really make the color scheme pop
I suppose and then I also did a bead of
silicone along the base of the shower
tile here and just in case anything
flows out of there make sure you want to
keep that water tight so I'll throw that
for today it's a paint in the baseboards
they're white since the conk should be
dry now and I'm gonna mount a couple
towel racks on the wall right here
and lastly toilet paper holder it's
gonna go right there
alright guys it is now Saturday January
5th so officially two weeks since we
started working on this project I am now
ready to show you the after shots there
is the finished bathroom and I'm gonna
start out by pointing out some details
like for instance I put this stripped
down transition and stripped down and I
didn't film when I was installing this
but I did use a masonry bit to drill
them to the concrete and secure that
nice and solid so that it's not going
anywhere I also did some precision edge
trimming here to make sure it would but
up nicely against the existing doorframe
we've been using various elements of the
bathroom for the past few days and I can
confirm that everything is functional we
have no leaks
last night I finished painting the
baseboards as well as adding a little
bit more silicone caulking around the
outer area of the shower here to make
sure everything is nice and waterproof
also added the towel racks you can see
back here and then just this morning we
also added a how an hand towel rack if
there's anything missing that we're
still planning to add it's probably
gonna be a medicine cabinet on that wall
right there we do have one we're not a
hundred percent sure we're gonna go with
it so we decided to leave that out for
now we can live without it though
especially since we have plenty of
storage now via these drawers also last
night just edit the handles onto these
speaking of drawers here is one of the
jurors from our old vanity so first off
just like size difference that's pretty
awesome we have so much more storage
down here now also kind of a sad thing
but this old vanity is actually pretty
well made this is solid wood it's built
out of these are dovetail joints which
are like oh my gosh dovetail joints so I
think at least the frame of this whole
thing I am going to keep and it'll it'll
move into my workbench area or something
like that I did need to make an
adjustment or two to the plumbing back
here after we started right on the water
through it but fortunately everything is
all set now I wanted to point out that I
added a bead of silicone between this
rubber gasket here and the top of the
porcelain this is kind of unfinished
porcelain at that edge so that helped
this from a very slow leak that it was
happened happening with the drain then I
also added a bead of silicone around the
drain right there as well as around the
faucet finally over in this corner the
new toilets not too much to say about it
other than its clean functional new we
got a to flush option now depending on
how serious things are I've got the
bidet installed of course and it's a
much better seated on the very flat
floor now and that the plumber did it
silicone beat around that as well also
pro tip if your wife has an aversion to
changing the toilet paper roll get to
one of these slides right I've gotten
all the construction implements cleaned
up out of our bedroom now too so things
are looking pretty good
and one last thing I wanted to do before
I let you guys go is take a look at my
receipts to get an assessment of how
much this project actually cost so going
by store we took two trips to Ikea as
well as an online order and we spent
about seven hundred and forty dollars we
had four trips to Home Depot and spent
about nine hundred and fifty dollars we
had four trips to my local Ace Hardware
here and spent another close to $200 and
then of course there was the plumber who
charged six hundred and fifty seven so
the total was about two thousand five
hundred dollars for this project out of
pocket
however that does include some extra
stuff like a handcart tools that I will
be able to use in the future and in
going over those receipts we found that
Home Depot charges twice for the toilet
so I guess - about a hundred and seventy
dollars from that grand total look guys
that's gonna wrap it up for this video
thank you all so much for the feedback
on the part one of this and of course
leave me more feedback and let me know
what you think of the finished project
in the comments section down below I'm
definitely going to be doing some videos
on further home improvement projects I
have in the future of course those will
be here in there I'm still going to be
doing tech content as well thank you
guys again so much hit the thumbs up
button on your way out we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
