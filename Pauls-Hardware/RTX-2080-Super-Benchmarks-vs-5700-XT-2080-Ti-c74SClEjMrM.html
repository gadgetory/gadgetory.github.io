launch gauntlet which started with the
r-tx 20 60 and 20 70 supers which came
out back at the beginning of this month
followed very closely by the AMD Navi
Radeon rx 50 750 700 XT a scant 5 days
later now it is time to put the r-tx
2080
super to the test this time I have not
only the founders Edition straight from
Nvidia but also a third-party model from
ZOTAC the r-tx 2080 Super Edition should
you be super amped about this launch
stick around to find out and if you want
to check out my coverage of those other
launches I mentioned links are down in
the description the hydrotech series is
Corsairs new line of custom cooling
parts built for the world's most
powerful and stunning systems they've
gone all out with CPU and graphics card
water blocks pump reservoir combos
fittings tubing radiators and coolant
providing you with everything you need
to build a spectacular custom cooling
loop that lowers system temperatures and
improves performance complete with vivid
RGB light click the sponsor link in the
video description to learn more so first
off in video wasn't in as much of a rush
to launch the 2080 Super and that's
because it doesn't have as much
competition up in the $700 price range
where it now sits it's sort of confusing
to describe the pricing of these cards
in consumer friendly terms the original
art GX 2080 which was launched in
September 2018 was $700 but the founders
edition was $800 you could still find
$700 r-tx 2080s but they usually felt
very cut down in entry level for a $700
investment with bare minimum power
delivery and cheaper plastic shrouds the
new 2080 Super founders Edition starts
at $700 so you could maybe look at this
as a price drop if you felt the original
2080s price was fair of course I'll
leave that decision to your discretion
but the main point now is that if you're
looking for an Archie X 2080 Super you
really shouldn't be paying much more
than 700 bucks because that's what the
founders Edition costs and it is a quite
good card with a wraparound metal
backplate and an overall premium feel
and it maintains good clock speeds the
zotac amp edition of the RT x 2080 super
has a dual fan cooler as well but
features a custom PCB with an improved
16 plus for phase power delivery setup
as well as a modest overclock a boost
clock of 1845 megahertz versus the
founders editions 1815 the amp also
requires two 8-pin at PCIe power
connectors versus the founders editions
8
six both cards feature nice back plates
and the founders Edition sticks with the
green g-force r-tx lighting versus the
zotac amps RGB logo more on performance
in just a minute but back to the
question of competition is there any
from the AMD Radeon side the answer is
absolutely yes for the 2060 super and
2070 super which are pitted against the
rx 5700 which now goes for 350 bucks and
the 5700 XT which goes for 400 dollars
but there are no 5800 GPUs from the Navi
lineup at least not yet as far as I'm
aware so the art GX 2080 super must be
content to compete with the existing
r-tx 2080 and maybe the Radeon 7 from
team red but that card already struggles
against the RT X 2017 on super so we
shouldn't expect too much also those
rumors said it's going into life
ultimately Nvidia is competing with
themselves with this launch but
hopefully the upshot is that gamers who
are looking to spend about $700 on the
GPU can now get a bit more for their
money let's run down some specs before
we get to the testing though the big
boost for the 2080 Super is faster
memory the fastest GDD are 6 in the
world according to Nvidia running at
fifteen point five gigabits per second
which improves bandwidth up to 496
gigabytes per second beyond that the
coup de coeur count is boosted to 3072
versus 29:44 with the 2018 on super base
and boosts clocks are also juiced up to
1650 and 18 15 megahertz respectively
and total GPU power is increased to 250
Watts versus 215 watts for the non super
I gets you up to speed on the core specs
so let's get to my test numbers starting
with a look at clock speeds here we're
looking at listed base and boost clocks
for the cards as well as the peak clock
speed hit during testing and the most
important information the actual
sustained average clock speed compare if
you will the asus strix r-tx 20 atti
benchmark numbers if you want an example
of why base and boost clocks don't
always have a big impact it has the
lowest base in boost 1350 and 1650 but
the highest peak clock of 2010 but under
sustained load it drops down to a more
reasonable 1815 megahertz the 2080
supers both hit 1995 max but averaged at
1920 or 1935 with the zotac amp just
barely edging out the founders Edition
the power draw numbers looked pretty
good to me overall as well as expected
the 2080 supers drew more power
overall compared to the non-super 2080
by about 10 to 20 watts and this is
looking at total system power
consumption by the way the only thing
that makes the 20 80 supers look not as
good is the 20 80 TI which only drew
about 20 watts more while dominating the
benchmarks we'll be looking at in just a
second of course you have to pay over a
thousand dollars for the 2080 TI it's
very power efficient but not budget
efficient finally for temperatures the
r-tx 2080 supers did get warm peaking at
over 80 C for both the founders addition
and the zotac amp they were able to
maintain clock speeds at these
temperatures though so fortunately there
wasn't a big drop-off in frequency once
they went past 80 C now let's get into
some real benchmarks but first a quick
look at my test bed which is based on an
asrock Z 390 Taichi ultimate motherboard
and an Intel Core i $9.99 hundred K CPU
running at 4.8 gigahertz across all
cores it's cooled by the new Noctua Nhu
12 8-hour cooler the memory is a kid of
GCL royal RGB at 36 hundred megahertz
casa latency 16 and we're running
Windows 10 version 1903 which is
installed on a 512 gig Samsung 970 pro
m2 nvme SSD the system is powered by a
PC power and cooling 750 watt power
supply and we're using an open testbed
not a case just FYI for comparison I'm
including all of the Radeon benchmarks
from the Navi launch video and I've also
included NRT X 20 atti although it's not
the founders Edition it's the asus rog
Strix 2080 TI which is overclocked so
it's probably not fair but i don't care
this only cost $22 more than the
founders Edition on amazon right now so
deal with it and yes buy this over the
founders Edition if you have the
opportunity and you're spending 1200
bucks on a graphics card I'm getting
distracted all that said let's get into
the benchmarks let's start off the 3d
mark firestrike ultra this is running an
ultra 4k mode and it's a DirectX 11
synthetic tests for all of my percentage
comparisons I'm gonna make here I'm
using the founders Edition r-tx 2080
for my zero point so I'll tell you the
percentage difference from the 2080
so here the founders Edition 2080 super
is 3.8 percent faster and as otech 2080
super is 4.1 percent faster versus the
standard r-tx 2080 the 2080 ti meanwhile
is 28.3% faster and this is a trend
we're gonna see throughout my tests
we're looking at zero to five percent
improvement for the super cards compared
to the non super next up is 3d mark x by
extreme also at synthetic but this time
running with the DirectX 12 API here we
3.3% faster performance from the
founders edition 2080 super and 3.7
percent faster performance from the
zotac 2080 super again as compared to
the standard r-tx 2080 20 atti meanwhile
was 31.4% faster
my last synthetic is 3 mark vr mark blue
room which is a virtual reality based
test also by 3d mark here again the RTS
2080 super outperformed the standard
r-tx 2080 by about 5% whereas the so
tech amp r-tx 180 super came in just
behind at about 4.4 percent faster next
up we have ashes of the singularity
escalation running at 4k 3840 by 2160
this is again a DirectX 12 test and I'm
using the crazy preset at 4k the
founders edition 2080 super was about
1.2 percent faster than the founders
Edition r-tx 2080 meanwhile the zotac
r-tx 2080 super was about 0.4 percent
slower versus a standard r-tx 2080
fortunately this trend didn't continue
throughout the rest of the test this was
the only test where the zotac card was a
little bit slower here looking at 2560
by 1440 for ashes of the singularity
escalation again the founders edition
2080 super is faster about 1.7 percent
faster than a standard RT x 2080 the
zotac card once again it was 1.3 percent
slower in this test not performance I
would be extremely proud of but
fortunately as I moved on through the
rest of the tests the zotac card did
recover if we move on to 1920 by 1080
for ashes of the singularity the
founders edition 2080 super was 2.5
percent faster than the founders Edition
RT X 2080 and the zotac 2080 super was
about 0.6% faster so did recover at 1080
moving onto shadow of the Tomb Raider
next this is a DirectX 12 test running
at the high preset at 3840 by 2160 or 4k
the founders edition 2080 superhead 64.6
average frames per second that's about
6.4 percent faster than a Founders
Edition RT X 2080 meanwhile the zotac
had a huge recovery here was actually
7.1 percent faster than the standard RT
X 2080 with his average frame rate of 65
frames per second moving down to 2560 by
1440 resolution and shadow of the Tomb
Raider here the founders Edition 2080
super is 3.8 percent faster than the
standard RT X 2080 does otech RT X 2080
super is 4.4 percent faster so here the
zotac recovered once again and did beat
the founders edition finally at 1920 by
1080 it was a much tighter race
founders edition 2080 super is just 0.5%
faster than the standard r-tx 2080 while
the zotac was 1.3 percent faster with
its average frame rates of one hundred
and fifty point five
moving on to GTA 5 the old standby this
is still a DirectX 11 test at 4k 3840 by
2160 the founders edition 2080 super is
5.1 percent faster than the RT x 2080
standard meanwhile the zotac RT x 2080
super it was three point eight percent
faster and in this test did not manage
to beat out the founders edition if we
move over to 2560 by 1440 the founders
edition 2080 super is about three point
five percent faster than the standard RT
x 2080 with its average frame rate of a
hundred and forty seven FPS the zotac
was just a tick slower at a hundred and
forty six frames per second so about 3.7
percent faster than the RT x 2088
standard and finally in 1920 by 1080 and
GTA 5 the founders edition 2080 super
was 3.2 percent faster than the standard
RT x 2080
and the zotac amp RT x 2080 super was
2.5 percent faster than the standard RT
x 2080 with its average frame rate of
162 next up is battlefield 5 this is
running at Ultra settings and DirectX 11
mode here at 4k 3840 by 2160 the
founders edition 2080 super is 4.7
percent faster than the standard RT x
2080 with an average frame rate of 67
FPS the zotac again was just a tick
slower at 66 FPS so 3.1 percent faster
than a standard RT x 2080 meanwhile its
2560 by 1440 the founders edition 2080
super is about 4.6 percent faster than a
standard RT x 2080 and the zotac is
about 3.7 percent faster than an RT x
2080 again just to tick behind here
under than 12 FPS for the zotac versus
113 FPS for the founders edition finally
at 1920 by 1080 in battlefield 5 the
founders Edition 2080 super was 2.1
percent faster than a standard RT x 2080
and the zotac did get the win over the
founders edition although again just by
one frame 144 FPS versus hundred and
forty three let's take a look at our
overwatch numbers this is running on the
epic setting which is pretty overkill
for overwatch so if you are looking at
real frame rates here you can get better
frame rates by a dialing stuff back just
a little bit that said at 4k 3840 by
2160 founders edition 2080 super was 2
percent faster than a standard
2080 and the zotac was 1% faster than a
standard r-tx 2080 so not a huge
difference here and it's even closer
actually if we move over to 2560 by 1440
here the founders edition 2080 super was
pretty much exactly the same we had 196
frames per second on both the 2080 and
the 2080 super the zotac card was not to
be outdone though it came in at 198 FPS
so it's about 1% faster
finally at 1920 by 1080 once again the
founders Edition 2080 super exactly on
par with the founders Edition r-tx 2080
no difference between the two and again
the zotac comes in 1% faster with an
overall frame rate of 289 versus 286 and
our final game test here is also one of
my newest this is Metro Exodus running
in DirectX 12 mode at 4k 3840 by 2160
the founders edition 2080 super is just
1 percent faster than a standard r-tx
2080 with an average frame rate of forty
point six versus 40 point two the zotac
card did just a little bit better here
with an average frame rate of forty
point nine that puts it 1.7 percent
faster than the standard r-tx 2080 if we
move over to 2560 by 1440 the founders
edition 2080 super is 4.7 percent faster
than a standard r-tx 2080 and the zotac
is 5.9 percent faster here since it
managed to get 60 7.9 average frames per
second it is the winner unless of course
you've been looking at the 20 80 TI
numbers this whole time which scored 80
point 9 fps man the 2080 TI is it's a
very powerful card and finally at 1920
by 1080 the founders edition 2080 super
is 2 percent faster than the standard
r-tx 2080 with an average frame rate of
80 3.7 versus 82 meanwhile the zotac is
5.9 percent faster with an average frame
rate of 80 5.1 and of course everything
is behind the art 620 80 TI as it has
been in all of my tests which managed an
average frame rate of hundred and 2.7 in
this test once again I have a couple
cumulative slides here to give you guys
a more wholesome view of all of my tests
and the differences between the various
cards again I'm using the RT X 2080
standard founders Edition for my
baseline here with 100% of the score and
you can see the percentage differences
up and down the stack the RT x 2080
super founders edition actually
outperformed the zotac amp r-tx 2080
super the via very slim margin we were
at three percents better with the zotac
card three point four percent better
with the RT x 2080 super i think this
comes down
to ASIC quality between the two cards
because performance wise they were both
acting exactly the same as I was running
the test just minor variants between the
two of course again the r-tx 2080 TI is
going to dominate throughout 28.8%
faster here just shows you how far our
head that card is I'm not going to say
that means it's justified to charge as
much money as Nvidia actually charges
for it but yes there's still a lot of
headroom with their architecture and the
2080 Ti is what you have to get in order
to get that Headroom for now though at
least we are looking at better
performance with the super cards if you
look at 2560 by 1440 again we're looking
at just about a 3% bump in performance
for the 2080 Super cards whether you're
looking at the founders Edition or these
otech amp version again just a slight
edge by the 2080 Super founders Edition
here at 3.1 percent faster versus 2.8
percent faster for the zotac amp we had
about a 22 percent lead for the RT X 20
atti at 1440 and then you can see the
rest of the cards in the stack as they
line up one final slide here and this is
just taking those percentage differences
adding them to a chart so it's a bit
more visually digestible for you guys
and then I've also added the price of
each card so you can kind of get a
visual representation of those to sort
of cross examine and see alright do you
get more for your money with this card
or less for your money with this card
obviously the r-tx 2080 TI is the very
expensive card here which also has the
most performance it's going to be up to
you whether or not that performance is
worth the money I wasn't exactly sure
what to put for the pricing for the r-tx
2080 but for what it's worth I used the
founders Edition pricing which is what
is indicating that there is a price drop
for the 2080 superbeing 700 bucks versus
the standard r-tx 2080 being 800 bucks
all that said though hopefully this
chart is giving you a better idea of the
value that you're getting for your money
ok so let's draw some conclusions from
all of this is the RT X 2080 super a
good cart I would say yes although it's
a bit less exciting because it's 700
bucks which is expensive for a lot of
consumers out there and it's not
providing us with as much of a jump in
performance compared to the previous
version if you compare it to the 2060
super and 2070 super launches that said
if you were considering an RT X 2080 for
700 to 800 dollars last week you can now
get a 2080 Super that's a bit faster
this week and hopefully you won't need
to pay more than $700 maybe 730 or 750
bucks if it's a special third-party
design I actually don't know the price
of this ZOTAC amp 2080
super right now that's still being
decided one day before launch but I
wouldn't spend too much more than 700
bucks on it that's what I'm trying to
say third party designs aren't
necessarily going to net you a huge bump
in performance compared to the founders
edition so I just wouldn't recommend
spending more for some RGB lighting and
overbuilt power delivery that doesn't
ultimately equal more performance for
the same price then you're making more
of an aesthetic decision between the two
and yes then I'd probably lean more
towards the zotac because there's some
additional value in that proposition I
think the real mix-up in the high-end
space for GPUs will come if and when
Radeon launches cards that compete in
the 500 to $700 range but until then I
think PC gamers who are building systems
and say the 1,400 to $2,000 range for
the whole system will be happy with the
2080 Super if you can't afford the 20
atti of course and I think that's a good
spot to end this video hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it and let me know
in the comments section down below what
you think of the Archie x28 super who's
gonna buy one maybe a few of you will
thanks for watching this video though
guys and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
