Paul's hardware this is a build video
which I'm excited about because I
haven't done one in a little while I'm
here with my brother-in-law Jason how's
it going Jason good good thanks Jason is
my brother-in-law that's all you need to
know everything else about him is very
mysterious that we'll leave it at that
this build though is also the build that
you saw in my recent October builds
video so what I actually sort of
assembled there in theory is about 90%
of what you see here this build that
we're doing today is not going to
feature a graphics card so that's the
only thing we're really leaving out then
the other thing is that we swapped out
the case from that build with the case
that Jason actually already had which
was this Rose will what is this you to
legacy you three know like ICU three
right B yes you three B because it's the
B's for black anyway um so real quick
before we dive into the parts list here
Jason why do you need a new computer all
the old ones are breaking okay that's a
good reason what are you planning to use
this computer for a few different things
normal stuff like email and Netflix
watching movies and so forth my wife
also teaches your sister oh yeah that's
what my sisters has teaches online
courses from home so she uses Adobe
Connect okay and so she needs something
that will work well for that so as a
sort of web browsing and Netflix
watching and a little bit of work Adobe
Connect isn't terribly intensive but um
this is actually probably a little bit
overkill for that this is gonna have
more performances actually needed here
but we also allowed for an upgrade path
with this system so adding a video card
in the future can easily make this a
very capable gaming system and Jason has
promised me that he will do that very
soon mm-hmm definitely we're gonna keep
talking I think it's actually my sister
I need to talk into allowing
allowing Jason to gamer that's probably
a big contributing factor since there's
a baby on the way but let's go over the
parts I'm excited about about all the
components that we have here and let's
yeah let's get into it and start with
the parts let's start with the processor
this is the core i5 6400 this gives you
a quad core processor no hyper threading
here although it does have turbo boost
functionality it's also not
overclockable but it also comes in at a
lower price point and say 6600 K so
again quad core is a little bit overkill
for you know just a basic web browsing
system and that kind of thing but if
this were upgraded to a gaming system I
think this would have much better chops
at doing that kind of thing and also
it's a quad core which i think is more
of a standard these days than a dual
core so that is the processor we're
going to be using the stock heatsink fan
that comes along with that
the crucial BX 100 wanted to be next so
it jumped out here it is a SSD 250 gig
nice reasonably priced 250 gig SSD not
the fastest of the fast when it comes to
your SATA rev3 SSDs around the market
that does a really good job and it's the
only storage in this system
although Jason might be dropping in a
hard drive in the future but again
that's an easy upgrade so we'll leave
that to it the power supply is right
over here on our left this is the EVGA
550 watt what is what is the model so
this is it's a supernova GS 551 and I
chose this one not just because it's 550
watts an 80 plus gold which means gonna
save on the power bill but also all the
cabling it in here is very nice
it's all black there are no hideous
burst of color cables in there we also
have some Corsair memory of course this
is the Vengeance Series dr4 since we
need ddr4 to go along with our 6400
processor from Intel the skylake
processors use ddr4 this is 3000 speed
went for faster speed memory that was
available because faster speed memory is
going to improve the performance of the
integrated GPU that's part of the the
processor so that means it's going to
get a little bit more out of that and
it's a 2 by 4 gig kit 8 gigs solo which
is pretty much all you need you could
even get away with less than that but I
think 8 gigs is kind of a good standard
baseline to start off with motherboards
right here this is the gigabyte h1 70
and Wi-Fi
there it is in all of its glory this was
featured on the the awesome Hardware
just this past week so we're excited
about that I really like this as a mini
ITX board it's got tons and tons of
features as long as you don't need to
overclock the H 170 chipset does pretty
much everything you need
aside from overclocking and speaking of
upgrade paths it's got an MDOT 2 slot on
the back so if Jason ever wanted to drop
in like even faster SSD storage there
it's going to end up - with PCI Express
connection so you can deal with the
fastest of the fast new nvme SSDs which
is pretty cool but of course the case
right here again the rows will you three
legacy u3 this case isn't available
anymore so if you guys are clicking on
the second link that's in the
description for the build it'll actually
link to this build with another case
which was the rosal Neutron which is
like 40 bucks right now which is also a
pretty nice case this is the this is
cool and - it's got the window on it
it's got aluminum on the outside very
lightweight but that's enough that's
enough introduction we're gonna actually
build this thing I'm gonna walk you
through a few the steps I'm going to be
kind of guiding Jason through part of
this since he wanted to learn to build a
new system
you excited Jason I'm excited I'm
excited I'm thrilled see I finally found
someone to match my energy level me and
Jason we're gonna have a nice mellow
time building the system
guys Jason is now installing front panel
connectors for the first time ever while
sharing his pain
you
alright guys the system is put together
more or less there's not a lot of room
for cable management in this case but
that's cool everything actually came
together pretty well I think we're at
the moment of truth now we've plugged in
the power supply and Jason is going to
do the honors and see if this thing will
actually power run ok switch 1 now we
gotta push the power button on the front
Hey ooh
fans are spinning life is on lights on
everything looks beautiful
let's build the let's build one pretty
smoothly it was mainly a lot of just
kind of learning experience for Jason
this is his first system that he has
assembled so he did it mostly himself I
only I only helped once or twice right
right I was just kind of talking I was
talking most of the time I kept going
off on tangents but that's what I do
Systems pretty quiet so far - this is
going to be a top heavy build since the
power supplies at the top and we don't
have an SSD or graphics card or a hard
drive I should say down at the bottom
holding stuff down but all together I
think it's it's nice it's going to stay
nice and quiet and I think it's going to
get the job done what do you think Jason
I think so cool all right so guys thank
you so much for watching this video if
you enjoyed it and you think this is
nice build hit the thumbs up button
don't forget that I'll be back with more
videos very soon thanks again Jason for
bringing your system over here and
letting us put it together thanks for
your help all right
have a good one guys we'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
