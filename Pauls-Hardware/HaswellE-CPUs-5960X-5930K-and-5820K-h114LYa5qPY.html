platform
this means that haswell-e socket 2011 -
three CPUs x99 motherboards and ddr4
memory are now available to the public
this video is about the CPUs and I will
casually suggest that if you liked this
video or if you find it helpful you
should like it and also check out my
memory and motherboard videos for more
information about these new parts and
how they work in the desktop computer
and whether or not you should consider
buying them in the first place so what
is intel's enthusiast platform anyway it
is a halo platform it is meant to be the
top of the range the best of the best
and a duteous hardware from Intel always
gives you their most powerful CPUs
better than dual channel memory support
triple or quad the most expandability
it's also usually the most expensive of
their consumer options it is meant for
gaming it's meant for overclocking and
it's meant for content creation it does
a great job of all of these things but
if you're strictly looking for a gaming
system or simple web browsing enthusiast
is really way overkill so check out in
still intel's mainstream platform
instead which is currently based on
socket 1150 motherboards with these e97
chipset the best thing about intel's
enthusiast platform in my opinion is its
longevity whereas the mainstream Intel
platform is usually renewed every year
or year and a half enthusiasts can
actually last three or four years before
it's supplanted by newer Hardware
case-in-point folks who invested in an X
79 system back in 2011 still had
arguably the most powerful platform in
2014 at least up until yesterday
haswell-e
CPUs I guess we can call them Intel Core
i7 but I think that just confuses things
they're using the new 22 nanometer
Haswell architecture but it's a way way
bigger CPU die than mainstream has well
or the Haswell refresh LGA 2011 - 3 is
the socket and maintains the same at
2011 contacts but physically it is
incompatible with x79 socket 2011
motherboards the sockets CPU cooler
mounting system though remains the same
so it does still have that glorious
built-in backplate and at
you can carry over your favorite cooler
from your previous build the CPU is
having 140 watt TDP they're compatible
with x99 chipset motherboards and all
have support for quad-channel
ddr4 memory Intel standards like turbo
boost and hyper threading are also still
available three CPUs are available at
lunch as you can see here they're all K
parts which means they are multiplier
unlocked for your overclocking pleasure
the 5820k is the most affordable and it
comes in at a mere $400 feature six
cores 12 threads a 15 megabyte cache 3.3
gigahertz base clock and 3.6 gigahertz
turbo boost it has 28 PCI Express gen3
lanes and that's less than the other two
more expensive CPUs but that still means
it has more than the 16 lanes then a
mainstream 4790k would offer you for
example and still enough for most to
weigh in 3 Way GPU configurations the 59
30 K is the bang for your buck CPU at
five hundred and ninety dollars and
although it still features six cores 12
threads and a 15 megabyte cache it has a
bumped up base clock of 3.5 gigahertz
and a 3.7 gigahertz turbo also a full
complement of 40 PCI Express gen3 links
the 59 60 X is the Big Daddy the extreme
edition and also the costliest at 1050
dollars you got to pay to play this time
around because only the Extreme Edition
features 8 cores and 16 threads its
Intel's first Nanjiani octo-core you
also get a huge 20 megabyte cache and a
somewhat dialed down frequency of 3
gigahertz base and 3.5 gigahertz turbo
it is after all on 8 core but don't
worry it's an extreme edition so it is
overclockable and you still get 40 PCI
Express gen3 lanes so there it is new
and powerful CPUs that you can use to do
computer stuff I found Intel's decisions
about what to include and what not to
include in each processor at the entry
mid and high end of the spectrum to be
interesting it certainly makes the
Extreme Edition a much more compelling
option being the only 8 core but I've
also heard some grumbles about the only
28 PCI Express lanes on the 5820k but
honestly with 3-way support already
taking care of
is that really that much of an issue
what do you guys think let me know in
the comment section down below like and
share the video if you enjoyed it
check out my memory and motherboard
videos as well check out Kyle's channel
for a full extent and I'm build and as
always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
