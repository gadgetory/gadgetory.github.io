everybody welcome back to Pauls hardware
this is a sort of a vlog style video
because then I haven't been posting
quite as many videos recently as i have
before i'm trying to do like two week
they're never like keeping up with it
right now to watching TV you might know
why it's because i've been gone for a
couple weekends and usually on the
weekends is when I should videos so this
weekend I'm actually on a vacation with
my wife I'm in anza borrego which is as
you can see in California pretty cool
they're supposed to be some wild flowers
here but I just wanted to do a quick
follow-up video I want to say thank you
to all the new subscribers because they
keep coming in and it's been really
awesome just all of the positive
feedback also we're here in hands of
borrego to do a few different things
some sightseeing some hiking we were
gonna also do some wild flower looking
at and taking pictures of but we found
out that thanks to a fairly dry winter
there's really not a whole lot of
wildflowers going on so we're over here
at the slots and if you guys aren't into
like desert topography or like the
beauty of the desert it's kind of a
stark beauty not everyone's that into it
but there's lots of stuff here that you
might not expect so this is all caused
by erosion down here behind us we're
gonna go take a quick walk through
because it's pretty cool looking
we're now hanging out in Christmas
circle this is kind of the center
borrego springs it's where the big
roundabout is and it's where the locals
come to hang out and beat the heat in
the middle of the day as a shade grass
this is actually where I'm going to end
this video though so I want to say a big
thank you to all the guys for watching
this hopefully also make a decent stop
gap between last week when I ran into
videos and next week when I can make
some more I want to say a big thank you
to my wife who's holding the cam right
now because she's been very patient with
me shooting a video on our vacation and
also tell you guys again for watching I
just want to share a little bit more of
my life and what I do because apart from
playing with hardware building computers
playing video games I like to get out
and see the world and explore and stuff
and I encourage you all to do so as well
if you do happen to visit anza-borrego I
have a couple suggestions one would be
to get a four wheel drive car with with
lots of ground clearance because I'm in
a little Honda Accord which doesn't have
very much ground clearance it's two
wheel drive so it's a little bit harder
to get to some of the roads also be
careful if you do have a dog like our
puppy nore because a lot of the trails
around here once you get a bit further
out you can't bring dogs on so it does
limit you a little bit with where you
can go but we've still driven all around
the the basin floor here and we've hiked
up a few different places and it's been
really awesome so if you guys want to
see more videos of course you can find
them on my youtube channel and we'll see
you next week when I'll bring you more
homes hardware
