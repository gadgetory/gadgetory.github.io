Pauls hardware today I am packing up
this box right here which is full of
some corsair goodies and h 150 i pro and
MP 500 SSD and actually threw in a
couple of these Corsair lite loop 140
sets of RGB fans and alcohol inserts
there as well the point being this was a
giveaway actually that i ran a little
over a week ago and it ended actually
about 5 days ago and I have yet to draw
the winners so I'm gonna do that right
now but just being in the giveaway kind
of mood I thought why not give away more
stuff I actually just recently last week
hit 800,000 subscribers here on YouTube
so a huge thank you to all you guys who
have subscribed to my channel it is for
you that I make this content and I am
grateful to everyone who has subscribed
and I want to give a little bit back so
today I have sort of a poorly planned
out giveaway that's what I'm calling it
I have 8 items to give away for 800,000
subscribers
and I did not really coordinate directly
with any vendors to do this I just kind
of came out here this morning
selected some stuff from my stash of
goodies that I have here in my garage to
give away and I have arranged them for
you guys I'm gonna make it international
and I am gonna handle the shipping and
everything myself so this might not be
the best idea but I'm gonna go through
with it anyway
because it's been a little while since I
did a giveaway celebrating my subscriber
count six hundred and fifty five
thousand four hundred eighty two was the
big milestone that I celebrated just a
few months back but now with 800 K let's
go ahead and give some stuff away to you
guys I'm actually eight hundred and
three thousand subscribers right here
although it says eight hundred and two
thousand subscribers right here go home
YouTube you're drunk but before we run
over the prizes for today let's quickly
choose the winner from this giveaway
from last week and draw just under
15,000 entries for this one I didn't
really promote it that much so that's
why there weren't a whole lot of entries
but our winner is Chris so a big
congratulations to Chris I'm gonna tweet
this out right now and I will also be
sending Chris an email right now but if
Chris doesn't get back to me within 24
hours I'll be drawing a new winner so of
course follow me on twitter i'm paul
hardware on twitter and you can be
appraised if you entered this giveaway
to perhaps win this prize if chris isn't
on the ball and doesn't get back to me
soon but let's move on so here my eat
prize is for
800,000 subscriber giveaway and pretty
much all of this was provided by vendors
to me for other projects except for the
CPU the CPU actually purchased out of my
own pocket but not necessarily for this
giveaway directly a few of them have
been used very briefly but everything is
in great condition so let's just start
off over here on my left the master keys
MK 750 the top-end Cherry MX keyboard
from coolermaster is the prize number
one so maybe you can win that below that
we've got an X 299 or s gaming seven
motherboard from gigabyte so if you want
to get on Intel's high-end desktop
platform you'll have your motherboard
sorted at least I got a nice memory kit
here from G scale this is the flare X 16
gig kit its ddr4 3200 speed and the
flare X kits are made specifically to
work with Verizon so you're gonna get
Samsung B die chips on these memory
sticks and it means that if you want to
plug in a rise and cpu set XMP and not
worry about any memory compatibility
issues that's where you want to go for a
cooler I've got the cry Rig h7 quad
looming a very effective air cooler and
it's got RGB integrated there as well
for the CPU we've got the Intel Core i7
7800 X which is a six core 12 thread
processor and also a great way to get
yourself going on Intel's high-end
desktop platform for a storage drive
here this is actually an external drive
from Toshiba the XS 700 which is a 240
gig external SSD so great for on the go
or maybe setting up a steam games drive
on that and finally probably the biggest
prize I've got going today is the
geforce gtx 1080 right here from EVGA
this is the for the wind version comes
pre overclocked a very good performer
and then the last prize is actually
sitting back there behind me this is the
Liam Lee PC zero 11 dynamic design and
collaboration word up with their Bower
insanely good feedback and reviews on
this case from lots of different people
who have taken a look at it so there are
the prizes guys this is all
international except for the case I'm
sorry shipping on a case is really
expensive as is so the case isn't only
going to go to a u.s. winner other than
that everything else is up for grabs
