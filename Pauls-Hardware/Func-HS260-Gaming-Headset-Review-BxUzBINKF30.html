Pauls hardware today I'm going to be
doing a review of the funk HS 260 gaming
headset now this is folks first ever
gaming headset it has an eighty dollar
MSRP and I gotta say it's a very
competitive market in that price bracket
for instance you have the steelseries
siberia v2 razor time at and Kraken pro
corsair vengeance 1,400 1,500 astro 8 30
s that's just to name a few so my
question originally was what is going to
set the funk HS 260 apart from the rest
of the crowd and after reviewing I would
say it doesn't have any particular
standout feature but I would say the
funk is really delivered an extremely
solid and well-designed headset that
makes a lot of good choices when it
comes to feature implementation while
easily measuring up to headsets that
cost a hundred dollars or more the hs2
60s retail box is very clean it's white
and orange like their ms3 mouse
packaging and it's got a peekaboo flap
that gives you a first look at the
headset the back has a listing of
product features accessories include the
detachable microphone a three meter
black and orange braided cable and extra
set of leather ear pad cushions to go
along with the the lure cushions that
come installed on the headset add a
registration card and manual funk is
also providing buyers with a two-year
manufacturer's warranty for the HS 260
which is a very nice warranty here's a
look at the headset while I finish up
some tech specs so you get a 50
millimeter paired and tuned driver for
each year 32 ohm impedance rating and
the ear cups are a closed design so they
will block out a good amount of outside
noise and I want to consider this if you
need a headset that lets you stay more
aware of your environment but a closed
design does allow you to more easily
ignore friends and loved ones while
you're gaming I was happy immediately by
the weight of the headset itself and i
guess i should say lack of weight it's
very light the design is also pretty
understated with a black and grey /
silver color scheme which i prefer for
wearing in public or on an airplane
versus the gaudy look at me colors of
some other headphones out there you know
the ones also i really like the soft
touch rubberized finish on the earcups
construction is sturdy and rugged
overall which is nice considering the
weight the headband is very flexible
with some soft squishy padding
the top the only thing I could ask for
here would be some metal reinforcements
on the headband adjustment but that's
only because I had a traumatic
experience with a world of warcraft
headset many years ago volume control is
easily accessible on the bottom of the
left ear cup which I much prefer to an
inline cable attachment for volume
control you also have a mute slider
switch at the base of the boom mic which
makes sense to me speaking of the boom
mic I really like that it's detachable
as it makes the headset a bit more
flexible for use as just headphones if
you take them on a trip a really cool
feature is that you can plug the audio
cable into the bottom of either ear cup
as well as the boom mic so you can
switch them back and forth so if you
hate that almost every headset has the
mic and cable on the left this could be
the headset for you the HST 60 has a
frequency response of 20 to 20,000 Hertz
and here is the frequency response to
try to prove it if this makes no sense
to you I can subjectively tell you that
I was quite impressed with the sound
quality here I listened to some 320
kilobit per second mp3 tracks including
some CCR some Queens and Paul Simon
temple of the dog and some Dragonforce
and it can't quite keep up with the high
range clarity of my current headset that
i use it home d sennheiser pc 360s but
that's really an unfair comparison since
those costs like two to three times as
much as these the base on the HS 260 was
punchy but not muddled or overpowering
and the mids and highs were excellent
for this price range so in closing the
HS 260 was comfortable lightweight has
an excellent end useful feature set and
nothing really that I felt was
extraneous for unnecessary which is
definitely nice to have when it comes to
a head set also the sound out of the
drivers was great for the price again
it's not going to match up with a
two-hundred-dollar plus set of
headphones but it's definitely gonna put
some pressure on the 8200 dollar range
headset market because I really feel
like this is a strong offering in that
zone so definitely highly recommend it
for me a great value keep your eyes
peeled and i'll post a link in the video
description to a place where you can buy
these which is probably going to be
newegg.com but thanks for watching this
video if you enjoyed it leave me a like
or dislike and I'd love to hear comments
from you guys as far as how many of you
actually use headsets or how many you
guys actually speakers to use 1 DS the
other to use a comment
both specifically for gaming but if you
enjoyed this video again go ahead and
subscribe to my youtube channel go ahead
and head over there if you want to see
any of the other videos that I've
created I'll be bringing you more in
2014 we'll see you all next time
