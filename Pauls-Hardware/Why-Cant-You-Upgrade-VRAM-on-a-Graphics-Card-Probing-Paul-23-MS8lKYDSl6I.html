what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware this is probing Paul my monthly
Q&amp;amp;A series this is actually my probing
Paul episode for March of 2018 although
this might be post at the very beginning
of April so sorry about that
but you guys asked me questions these
questions are all taken from the comment
section of last month's video so last
month was episode 22 so if you guys want
to ask me questions for next month then
feel free to do so down in the comments
section of this video and so the cycle
continues
on and on into the future but let's just
jump right into it here and start ask
answering questions
most of these are questions some of them
are responses from me and about other
things but first off Marcus Palma says
great videos always do you do all your
editing yourself Thank You Marcus and
the answer is no I do not actually have
an editor who I work with his name is
Joe and if you're ever curious whether
Joe edited the video or I edited the
video you can go into any video that's
been uploaded by me and go to the
description and hit show more scroll
past all my links and stuff and down
here you can see I should almost always
say it's edited by Joe it's got a link
to his Facebook page and then down here
under editor you can actually go
straight to his YouTube channel if you
want to check that out everyone go
subscribe to Joe he does he does metal
metal videos and stuff like that
but yeah Jos channel he does just just
random little things that he pops up
from time to time he's done some editing
tutorials and that kind of thing which
is cool as well
but Jo is a great editor I've been
working with him for several years now
and he's much faster at it than I am
which is which is very good because I'm
very slow when I edit usually I will
record stuff here and then I'll take the
footage and I'll transcode it with my
editing PC here and then I send it to
him via BitTorrent sync or Brazilia sync
I guess it's called now and then he
edits and then he sends me back a
project file I take the project file I
loaded up and premiere attach all of my
uncompressed video footage and then I'll
do a final kind of run-through maybe
change a few things here and there and
then render it all out alternatively he
has actually been coming over to help me
make videos once a week or so and when
he does that he's able to just take the
raw footage himself which is which is
nice but Jo if you happen to watch this
thank you for all of your excellent work
you've done for me and anyone who's
watching go go follow Jo on Twitter too
he's also got a Twitter and tell him I
sent you a quick aside though you might
notice some background noise in this
video there's a train going by right now
and there's also a neighbor who's doing
some sort of strange construction work
so my apologies for that but let's move
on to the next question
this one's from solid state tech and he
asked why isn't vram upgradeable on GPUs
like regular DRAM is he says he thinks
he's seen some before but not for a long
time that's a good question and probably
something that lots of people would want
to do say buy gtx 1062 gig and then pop
an extra two gigs of VRAM onto there and
upgrade yourself in the future but video
cards typically when they're sold or all
self-contained the DRAM or the G DDR Ram
modules are soldered to the PCB which
makes it extremely difficult for an end
user to remove them and replace them or
anything like that also it's worth
pointing out that most GPUs have a fair
level of technical knowledge and
engineering that go into them and they
do try to pair the GPU as far as the
what it's capable of with a reasonable
amount of vram and they do that
sometimes to give the GPU the best
performance they can and then they also
do that sometimes to segments so for
instance that's why you have a gtx 1062
gig and a gtx 1064 gig and one is more
expensive than the other but there's
actually a little bit more to this
question and i want to hear point out
that a lot of times people go into
videos and put responses themselves so I
want to give a shout out to Brenda
Schwar who posted a reply to that
original comments and put a link to a
Korra giving us some back and forth on
that but also he linked to very
specifically the Dell matrix or a Dell
matrix eight Meg pci graphics card that
I wanted to show you guys this is
actually for sale over on Stuart
connections comm for $12 it's a Dell
matrix eight megabyte PCI video card and
there's other video cards I believe that
have had this capability as well but
what you got down here is an S Odom slot
so you can with this graphics card pop
pop in an Esso dim Ram upgrade and then
upgrade your video memory now you can't
do that with modern graphics cards for a
couple other reasons as well gddr5 gddr5
X memory runs hotter at least the
modules themselves can run hotter than
typical via Ram so usually there'll be
some sort of integrated cooling solution
that helps keep the vram modules cool
and then there's also the possibility of
degradation of performance typically if
you're looking at a VRAM pool for a
graphics card it's all going to be run
the same type of memory running at the
same speed in order for that graphics
card to operate efficiently and mixing
and matching different types of memory
is going to hurt or impact your
performance the best modern-day
comparison here that you can make is if
you're looking at something like an APU
like AMD's new Raven Ridge ap use they
use integrated system memory for their V
RAM memory buffer that allows you to go
in and flexibly change for example you
want 256 Meg's set-aside or 512 or a gig
or two gigs for the GPU specifically the
upshot is that the memory it's using is
system memory which is not tuned for
video tasks the same way that gddr5
memory is not to get too specific about
it
so if Nvidia did decide to make an
upgradable GTX 1080 or something like
that the amount of variation of
different types of memory that could go
in there the complexity of creating a
socketed form factor to where you can
slot something in or remove it would
just be too challenging and not make
sense when it comes to production costs
again this is the type of thing that
you've seen companies attempt in the
past and if they've attempted it in the
past and then now they've decided no
that's not a good way of doing it it
usually means either the product didn't
do well and it just wasn't making enough
money to be profitable so hopefully that
answers your question
question from Villa co3 says welcome
back Paul a long way to return if you
guys recall last month I was after I had
sort of been on hiatus for a while he
says I would love to see some 3d
printing videos from you and I did kind
of briefly mention this in the last
probing Paul but 3d printing yeah I find
it interesting and it's something that
I've wanted to dive into and I'd like to
just set up a 3d printer somewhere here
in the garage in the background I really
that's as far as I've gone with it I've
thought about it I've been giving it
some consideration and I thought oh like
I know Jerry
Barney Cleese nerdgasm and he could
probably help me out with that and you'd
be pointed in the right direction at
this point I don't have anything further
to add to that I haven't really made any
progress in that area but it is
something I'm still interested in so if
you guys have any suggestions for me
feel free to leave those in the comments
section and hopefully I'll pick up on
those because yeah I want to get that
set up pretty soon next question from
Mac gear says I'm looking forward to
building a system using one of the new
risin 2400 G ap use but I never eyes and
can be picky about what Ram it works
with what should I pay more attention to
any info I can find on the processors
compatibility or that for the
motherboard this is actually it's not
like a one or the other type thing it's
an A then B thing so if you already know
that you wants a Rison apu with 2200 G
or 2400 G those use and those slot into
the m4 socket so you want a m4 socket
motherboard from AMD and then second you
want to make sure that the motherboard
you buy is updated so it says it's Rison
Raven Ridge ready or rise in 2420 200g
Reddy difference advertisements have had
different stickers that go on there new
egg and some of the listings I've shown
has had a little bit of extra text that
says it's compatible just so you know
that the motherboard you're buying has
been updated to be compatible with these
new ap use what's that sorted then you
want to look at the memory and for that
I would say now that you've chosen your
motherboard based on the socket and
compatibility and probably maybe looks
and features and price of course also
goes into that decision well once you've
chosen your motherboard then you want to
go and look at your motherboard
manufacturers website like gigabyte or a
Susur asrock or that kind of thing go to
the qvl list
qualified vendor list I believe is what
that stands for there'll be a memory
compatibility chart and there you can
see specifically the memory modules that
that motherboard manufacture
has tested with that motherboard with a
rise in CPU to make sure that the memory
is compatible and that will give you the
best bet and making sure that that
memory can get will slot in you can plug
in the XMP settings and be off to the
races and yes
having decently fast memory now you go
for 29 33 or 3,000 speed or faster with
resin to give yourself the best
performance hopefully that helps you
the next question is not a question it
is a response and this was again from
last month when I was talking about
monitor calibration and I was talking
about monitor calibration from the
points of view of someone who produces
contents to post on the Internet's Jim
Cole here posted a lengthy response just
indicating you know that's not just
about me and what people like me happen
to do but he's actually very informative
and pointed out a few other things for
example calibrating a monitor to produce
print work is very important so consider
that as well as opposed to just viewing
stuff on the screen he actually pointed
out for example when he is doing print
work he might have different ambient
lighting in the room different ambient
lights changed the perceived color
effect on the screen so when he's doing
photo work he does a darkroom when he's
working with Illustrator InDesign he
does a brighter room so that the paper
the look on the paper after it's printed
will look more natural he also points
out that monitors change over time and
it's not necessarily a set and forget
type thing so it's very important if
you're doing professional work to go
back every three months he says every
one to three months it seems like a
reasonable timeframe to me to recheck
your monitor make sure none of the
colors have shifted and make sure that
whatever you're producing in a
professional environments is going to
print well and be represented well
wherever you happen to be sending your
digital artwork there were one or two
other comments about this last month one
of them specifically said why don't you
just rather than buying a monitor
calibration tool get your monitor and
look up other calibrations that because
people can take a calibration profile of
some monitors and upload it and you can
find someone else who has your exact
same monitor and just take their profile
there is a caveat to that as well though
because each panel is different if
mother if monitor manufacturers could
calibrate each panel I perfectly at the
factory then no one would ever need a
monitor calibration tool in order to
make sure that it's reproducing colors
properly just like with the CPU there's
slight variations that might affect your
overclocking performance with a monitor
there's slight variations in the
manufacturing process that might affect
the actual color reproduction of the
monitor itself so Jim thank you for
posting that and being informative and
letting me and a few other people know a
little bit more about that topic just I
wanted two more questions here to go
this one's from second to last get I he
says hey Paul have asked us to you and a
few other PC experts no one has given an
answer he's got a unique memory
configuration he has a two-by-four gig
2400 speed kits and a 1 by 8 gig
21:33 speed kits overclocked to 2400
he's also using a gtx 980ti
and an Intel skylake 6600 K he's
wondering about an upgrade to a 2 by 8
gig 3200 kits how beneficial would it be
and what it affects his performance with
4k and with VR now there's a slow
rolling train outside but I'm gonna
still proceed beyond the dual channel
for a single channel question you also
have a speed question you have 2400
speed memory and then you have an 8 gig
stick that you've overclocked a little
bit to also match 2400 typically your
memory is gonna run at the lowest common
denominator of speed so the fact that
we're able to overclock your eight gigs
gig stick that's good that meant that
you're able to run all of your memory at
2400 speed and your your changes if you
go for an upgrade are gonna be you're
gonna enable dual channel by going with
2 by 8 gig kit you're still gonna have
16 gigs overall so that won't change
your over our capacity and you should be
able to run it at 3200 speed with that
kit and with this processor so that
shouldn't be a problem either now the
things that you're gonna be logically
considering are the fact that single a
dual channel doesn't always give a big
performance boost the biggest
performance boost I've seen is when
you're pairing it with an AMD APU one of
the Raven Ridge ap is recently in which
case you definitely want dual channel
mode but since you're using an Intel
platform a skylight platform it's
probably not going to be that big of a
difference to you also the increase in
memory speed from 2400 to 3200 again
will improve performance but to what
degree and how much is going to change
based on what you're doing with it
now we're talking about 4k and VR here
so obviously you're trying to push
pretty high resolution and task your GPU
with some pretty important things so I
say you want all the speed you can get
if you're looking into this right now
memory is very expensive so I definitely
consider selling your two by four gig
kit and your one by eight gig kick and
replacing that complete with you with
your new two by eight gig kits and if
you can sell at high prices and buy back
at high prices and hopefully you won't
be losing too much money overall so yes
you might see just a marginal gain going
from what your current setup is to the
two by eight gig set up but I would go
for it anyway it's gonna be cleaner
setups you'll be better suited for those
high-end tasks that you want your
computer to be able to do and I yeah
it's it's really hard to say when it
comes to pricing whether you should buy
an hour weights but memory pricing sucks
I guess alright I have two more
questions actually this one's from we
toda Ora this actually wasn't posted on
the Q&amp;amp;A video last month it was posted
on the video I posted yesterday because
I was my house was dusty hold on let me
show you guys this is does your PC even
need a case I'll post a link to this in
the video description if you want to but
I tried to point out to people that I
very intentionally did not dust prior to
doing this video and we do dust out in
the living room at least once a week if
not once every couple weeks
I don't dust the computer itself like
the motherboard and everything but
around it unlike the console and the
shelves and everything like that I do
dust so I just want to point it out that
I spent a bunch of time cleaning
yesterday because I felt self-conscious
because everyone was giving me a hard
time about the dust and now it is much
cleaner and I just wanted to prove that
to you guys that I don't live in a in a
hovel with contaminants everywhere but
it's a constant battle especially with
the dogs alright one last question here
this one's from Sam Sam you he'll 70 82
he says have you ever given anyone the
Heimlich maneuver no pun intended and
this is of course a reference to my last
name which is Heimlich the German
spelling and I get this question asked a
lot when whenever I tell people my last
name I've never actually given it I've
never had to do the Heimlich maneuver on
someone I am familiar with how you do it
and stuff like that we used to have like
a chart and stuff when I was growing up
in our
and are in our pantry but I do want if
for any of you who looking for further
reading here here you go Henry Heimlich
is the inventor of the Heimlich maneuver
there's a picture he actually died just
a couple years ago in 2016 and and you
can read about him oh if you guys really
want to fun facts I am told that's my
family history my family tree goes all
the way back to Germany and that I am a
I am an actual Heimlich going way way
back to whenever my ancient German
family decided that should be the name
whereas Henry Heimlich the inventor of
the Heimlich maneuver actually assumed
the name but I'm not even hundred
percent sure about that that could just
be could all be made up but that's all
the time I have for today guys I hope
you've enjoyed watching probing Paul
I'll be back again next month which
probably isn't gonna be very long since
it's already April now with another one
so of course leave questions in the
comment section down below if you have
any for me and follow me on Twitter if
you want to ask me stuff in the meantime
I've got more videos coming up this week
so hit the thumbs up button on your way
out and as always thank you very much
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
