to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster guys I'm here at Tesoro and
they have a wide range of peripherals
we're going to talk about some gaming
chairs some mice some keyboards and a
pretty nice set of earbuds as well let's
start with the chairs so we're on the
right the red and white trimmed chairs
are the Tesoro zone series and these
have actually been around for a while
but tessaro's been working on updating
them and making them a little bit more
suited to the needs of the customers
based on a lot of feedback they've
gotten but they of course have typical
stuff you would expect from a gaming
chair - Sora told us directly they're
not trying to reinvent the wheel here or
the chair or anything like that they're
just trying to provide a nice quality
product that you can get and sit in for
many many hours at a time I like that
they have a nice wide seat rest right
there
and in fact they've even made it a
little bit more wide on the new version
I'm going to show you in just a second
but you got the head support lumbar
support and you also have an incredibly
deep adjustable back angle so you can
drop it all the way back clasp or gas
lift so depending on your weight you can
still raise or lower the seat here's the
new one and this is the zone evolution
so this one they've taken some feedback
from people who have used the existing
chairs and they have added memory foam
in the both lumbar support as well as
the pillow up at the top these have a
faux leather finish it's polyurethane so
no cows were harmed in the making of
these chairs so that's nice it's also
going to be nice and breathable and
again this one has all the adjustments
that I like in a chair which is that the
armrests can go up or down forward or
back and then of course you can lay it
all the way back as I'm hopefully
demonstrating right here don't worry I
was able to recover from this very
uncomfortable position finally they have
also increased the height of the gasket
down at the bottom so that you can
actually raise it up to a greater height
than you had before so if you're a
little bit taller then you do have
support for the length of your legs I
suppose here's the sort of mice we got
to ask along the shore and the seguida
sikita I know I'm trying to pronounce
all these correctly it's basically got
MSRP of sixty dollars forty dollars
seventy dollars it's agree to the
highest end on
one over here which features a 6400 dpi
sensor and hundred Hertz polling rate
got some additional buttons scattered
around so you can you can reassign the
buttons
I would imagine okay you can reassign
those to get a 32-bit ARM Cortex
processor inside as well as some onboard
memory so if you reprogram and stuff it
can save it to the mouse
they've also read done the finish on
this so this is a mouse it has been
available for a while but they gave it a
little bit more of a kind of the dry
touch finish as I like to call it on
there which is pretty nice that was a
switch over from the sharor over here
which has previously been available in
white and black although they've kind of
combined the white and black together so
you got kind of a kind of a piano
looking looking finish on here so glossy
finish on this one you do have some RGB
lights on there that you can adjust on
the scroll wheel up at the top a little
bit sasural logo at the back adjustable
up to 4000 dpi on the sensor here this
one again has a retail price of about 40
bucks and then moving down to the
seguida spectrum down here 5,000 dpi
sensor on this one this one has a nice
ergonomic feel forward and back button
on the left side again sort of that dry
touch finish on the top and a bit more
of a glossy piano finish on the sides
nice feel and scroll wheel though it's
rubberized feels feels pretty good and
then of course button on top which you
can assign for dpi switching
acceleration up to 30 grams and a and
microbial soft touch touch finish if you
want the official word I just called
your eye touch because it feels dry
doesn't feel wet and that's probably not
good marketing though but don't worry
about it alright let's talk about the
keyboards we got over here the durandal
spectrum right here this is this one
using this is a genuine Cherry MX
switches and the retail price on this
one is 129 so it's available in Cherry
MX blue switches and as you can see it
also in has an individual / key
backlighting again a 32-bit ARM Cortex
processor integrated in there all the
stuff you would expect from a high-end
keyboard this one retails for $129 by
the way so yeah you can customize
everything and one thing that I like the
tesora is done with a wide with most of
the keyboards that we're going to look
at today is they actually have pastors
so you got a USB pastor in the back as
well as mic and headphone and that is
controlled just by the single connection
cable you get coming from the top so
there's
at one move on down the line to the to
Zona spectrum again we have RGB
backlighting on this one this one's
going to use kale switches so the price
is a little bit less this one actually
comes with a separate numpad so you can
buy just the 10 keyless keyboard by
itself for $89 for an extra 40 bucks you
can get the numpad to drop on the end
and then that has a USB they can
actually swap to either side so if you
want to position the keypad on the right
side of the keyboard you can or if you
want to move it over to the left side of
the keyboard you can do that as well
next we've got the Graham spectrum and
this is another keyboard that is it's
been out for a little while
but this one has low profile key
switches on it so they are still
compatible I should mention that of
course the Cherry MX which is down there
are compatible with cherry MX key caps
that the Zona also has kale switches but
has the same post that you can use
standard cherry key caps with as well
and then the Graham spectrum does have
that capability but again that
low-profile key caps so you're going to
need a low profile key cap sets to do
that properly and it's got the Tesoro
agile mechanical switches so this is a
switches that tesora has actually been
developing themselves I've been testing
these out may actually actually feel
pretty nice they're available in a
couple options blue and red so whether
you want clicking it or non quick enos
these are the non clicky versions that
I'm looking at right now and then again
of course the customizable backlighting
16.8 million color RGB the gram spectrum
also is very small like it's very thin
so the profile from the side you can see
you know if you need to take this on the
go drop it in a backpack or something
like that it's a little easy to do so a
little bit more portable I guess you
might say on that one now here is the
new keyboard that Tesoro is currently
developing this is the Graham se
spectrum special edition this one
actually has unique new switches they're
actually optical switches so these
infrared to actually detect each
keystroke again of course 16.8 million
RGB per key customizable backlighting
and key rollover all that good stuff but
I really like the feel these you know
they're not they're not your traditional
cherry switches or whatever but they've
been working on the touch on these and
everything just to get them perfect and
you know I just want to write a novel
right now just
just typing on this alright I should
probably stop that both the the Graham
spectrum over here as well as the Graham
suspect spectrum se both have detachable
cables that's the mini USB cable on that
which is a little bit more durable than
the micro USB in my experience the grand
masti spectrum is going to be available
soon we're expecting this in about the
July timeframe do we ever do do we have
a price for it
1:19 so that's pretty nice deal for an
RGB backlit mechanical switch keyboard
very nice feel but this one over here
doesn't have a name but basically
they're going for something a little bit
more akin like it you would expect these
to be civil it's just looking at them
because they're so low profile but they
are actually quickie and mechanical
again like this is the second or third
keyboard on this trip that I've tried
out that I thought was just a little
scissor switch board but it's actually
mechanical switches and they don't that
this is developing they're expecting to
launch it about q4 timeframe so they
need a name for it so what do you guys
think nice thin keyboard RGB
backlighting mechanical low profile
switches it's going to be part of the
Graham series so guys in the comments
let's us or know what they should name
this keyboard and they said they'll pay
you 10% of the profits I just made that
lied about the prophets name and where's
Anthony going Anthony's here hi Anthony
okay let's move finally we have the
Tesoro tuned and either available right
now these are in ear pro audio solution
they're costing about thirty five
dollars and they have a couple just kind
of very sensible features for like
in-ear devices like this I mean not only
are they're very inexpensive but they've
designed them so that they have a very
they have a textured grip on the outside
so they easy to get a hold of they've
made sort of an intelligent design with
these little handles on the bottom so
when you pick them up you can just
intuitively feel which way is left and
which way is right and they put magnets
on the back so that you kind of pop
together so you're going to have at
least a little bit less possibility of
your cables getting all cluttered up and
then you can wind it all up and that
comes with a nice little two servo case
to put them all into so guys let's wrap
it up for my coverage here at
to soro booth or suite I don't know it's
a room it's base it's a cozy corner room
actually is what this room is called but
