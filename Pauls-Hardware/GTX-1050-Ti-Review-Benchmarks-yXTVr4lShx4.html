this situation before you're preparing
to go out of town and suddenly an Nvidia
package shows up on your door and you
have a new graphics card to review this
is the GeForce GTX 1050 Ti just launched
from Nvidia they sent over this MSI of
very inch right here so I guess I have
no choice
so I was going to say I will do a quick
look at the 1050 TI because that's all I
have time for but I suppose I'll also be
doing a cursory glance at the GTX 1050
since both are not out today the 1050
cost $109 MSRP US Dollars and the 1050
TI is coming in at 139 dollars MSRP
let's start out by looking at the specs
so both of these graphics cards are
based on GP 107 a new GPU in the Pascal
family from Nvidia and there's only a
slight variance between the 1050 and the
1050 Ti also very sturdy both of these
cards and only slightly prone to falling
over anyway though apart from being
based on GP 107 the 1050 Ti at least has
two graphics processing clusters and six
streaming multi processors that gives
you 768 cuda cores 48 texture units and
32 ROP units the base clock is 1290 and
the boost clock is 1392 megahertz
although as is the case often with cards
in this range manufacturers will often
ship them at higher frequencies than
when a video gives you for the bass and
boost clocks memory clock is 3500 4
megahertz and that gives you 7 gigabits
per second of total memory data rate and
lastly the biggest difference between
these 2 cards is going to be the 1050 Ti
has a 4 megabyte frame buffer and the
1050 has just a 2 megabyte frame buffer
so that's pretty cut down although both
of them are operating on 128-bit memory
interface 412 gigabytes per second of
memory bandwidth Pascal by the way is 40
nanometer manufacturing process 3.3
billion transistors on the GP 107 and
either case and then for display outs on
either one you also have the same
options of one DisplayPort one HDMI and
one dual link DVI which is a nice
variety I suppose for card of this
caliber now the benefits of the lower
power lower cost cards like this is
they're often easy to drop into an
existing system thanks to the fact that
these only draw 75 watts of power which
is the same amount of power that's
delivered natively through the PCI
Express bus neither of these has extra
supplemental power connectors so all you
got to do is plug in the like in the
card
hopefully not knock it over
I've been doing and it should just work
for you pursuing you have you know
compatible system and install the
drivers and everything like that which
is cool now there are like I said a
bunch of different variations of this
card these from MSI were sent to me
directly by Nvidia but I also have been
hit up by Asus gigabyte EVGA there's
lots of others available there's a ton
of even pictures of them out right now
and what you're basically going to be
seeing is short cards like these right
here which you're only going to run in
the maybe five to seven inches long
range easy to put into small form factor
computers and don't take much additional
power and then you're also gonna see
variants that have our bigger have
larger cooling solutions dual fans and
possibly also the addition of a PCI
Express power connector for additional
power which would theoretically give you
more overclocking Headroom I didn't have
time to overclock these cards but I did
run some benchmarks on the 1050 Ti
running at the out-of-the-box speeds and
I did test this in the system that's
right back here that I've recently used
in my how to build a computer series
rather than the 69 50 X based system up
there over there which just would be
quite overkill for these cards anyway
that system is running on a be 150 pro 4
V motherboard from asrock its micro ATX
system I did run all the tests with
everything enclosed and whatnot it's on
an i5 6500 quad core CPU from Intel 16
gigs of DDR 4 memory from Corsair and I
ran all these tests at 1920 by 1080
because for these cards that's really
what you should be looking at 1440 and
beyond you're probably going to be
looking at something a little bit more
powerful in order to handle that
resolution starting right at though with
3dmark firestrike extreme we hit 33 77
overall on the score 3600 on the
graphics
7050 on the physics and 1504 on the
combined score 3dmark times pi which is
a DirectX 12 test came in at 2379 for
the overall score 2272 for the graphics
and 3246 for the CPU grand theft auto 5
a very popular game I certainly enjoy
playing it myself using the built-in
benchmark it got 60 1.9 average frames
per second that's using my default
settings for the benchmark which
includes 2x msaa
and pretty
all of those extra stuff set to very
high when it comes to the extra
configuration stuff you can do with the
graphics since 60 1.9 in real world was
actually ended up being more like 50 to
60 frames per second I found out that
just by turning off 2x msaa I was
achieving more like 70 to 75 frames per
second so easily playable at over 60 FPS
with $140 graphics cards so that's
pretty nice with most of the eye candy
turned on to overwatch is not a very
challenging game to play but lots of
people are interested in playing this
game because it's very popular and also
playing it at higher frame rates if
you're interested in getting perhaps a
higher refresh rate monitor for example
happy to say that using ultra settings I
hit 100 and 2.8 average frames per
second and 83 minimum frames per second
so again very playable with this card
for the very popular game overwatch csgo
again a game I'm imagining lots of
people might be interested in this card
for again also looking for really high
frame rates if you're looking for 144
Hertz or beyond
fortunately with all the settings maxed
180 frames per second was in the low
range of what I was seeing average was
around 190 to 220 frames per second so
really high frame rates achievable and
you should have no problem playing csgo
with this card finally I did try out
doom using the Vulcan API again testing
at 1080 with ultra settings and I found
I was able to hit 60 to 80 frames per
second as you can see here in this
riveting live gameplay footage as I kill
demons and that sort of thing incredibly
fun so uh first things first what did I
notice about the benchmarks I noticed
that for gigs is good for 1080 - gigs
not that I've tested this card is not
enough at least for the games that I was
testing half of the games that I ran
used more than two gigs frame buffer in
fact I used two point six gigabytes in
times by 2.8 gigabytes in doom 3 point 3
gigabytes in GTA 5 which can often be a
memory hog as it's loading up your
environment it's all around you and that
kind of thing temperatures fortunately
we're very nice 63 degrees Celsius is
what I hit using this card again with
everything running at just at the
out-of-box speeds fan speed was going in
the 45 to 50% range to achieve those
temperatures and was not loud at all
that's just anecdotal side into sound
test officially for this one let's round
this video out with some conclusions for
the 1050 Ti again the 1050 just arrived
and I am not having time to benchmark it
so perhaps more on this coming in the
future but the 1050 Ti I thought was a
really nice performer at 1080 and if
you're looking to get into PC gaming
having an entry-level graphics card that
you can rely on to play games at 1080
and get really decent frame rates even
in the higher-end games like GTA 5 and
doom this card seems totally capable of
that it definitely seems again I didn't
do apples to apples comparison but it
seems like it's beating out the RX 460
from AMD on their side so given that the
RX 464 gig costs 140 bucks right now and
you might see that price perhaps drop
down a little bit to have it slot in a
little bit better against the 1050 Ti on
the con side though these are definitely
still very much budget video cards for
instance if you look at the coup de
coeur count 768 CUDA cores on the 1050
Ti and then 640 CUDA cores on the 1050
the 1050 has one less streaming multi
processor five instead of six so that's
why you get less cuda cores only 40
texture units although you do get a bit
higher clock speed with the 1050 13 54
is the based in 1455 is the boost clock
memory configuration is the same apart
from the actual amount of memory so
there you have it I definitely lean much
more towards recommending the 1050 Ti
just like having that additional memory
in there as well as just a little bit
more performance at the close to the
metal level with a few more cuda cores
but don't fool yourself into thinking
that these cards are like close to like
a gtx 1060 the next step up from Nvidia
where you're spending more in the range
of $250 they are definitely not the 1060
for example has 1280 CUDA cores not
quite double but close to double the
amount that this one has in it so you
are going to see a pretty huge jump in
performance if you're going for a 200 to
250 dollar card versus these which are
more in the 100 to 150 dollar range all
that said though I think it's nice you
can spend about 140 bucks and get
yourself really solid 1080
it's out of the 1058 TI i hope this
video has helped you guys out and give
you a little bit better idea of what to
expect if you are investing in this
graphics card so leave me a comment in
the comment section down below let me
know what you think about these GPUs
there also be links to these in the
video description you can also hit the
thumbs up button and let me know if you
enjoyed the video while you're down
there that helps me out a ton also a
link is down there for my store where
you can buy t-shirts like this one yes
I'm actually wearing one of my t-shirts
today so check that out help support the
cause thanks for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
