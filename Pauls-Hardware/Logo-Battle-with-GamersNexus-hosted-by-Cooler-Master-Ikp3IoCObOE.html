you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master all right guys I'm a
cooler master now at Palms place they
are a sponsor so big thank you to cooler
master for sponsoring my CES 2019
coverage they have a ton of stuff to
show so let's get right into it let's
start off over here with the Q 500
series which is being upgraded and
expanded with a new Q 500 case which
they have added a power supply bracket
to so you can mount the power supply at
the front of the case and that allowed
them to expand the motherboard
compatibility so it now allows a full
sized ATX motherboard in there not just
micro ATX this has been a very popular
case for Coolermaster largely due to its
flexibility as well as this very
reasonable price here's a look at the
white version of the case the power
supply Mouse would be up here now and
then you can see full sized ATX
motherboard support as indicated by the
brackets there at the back now these are
super flexible when it comes to what you
can do with them so original design had
airflow coming in the front lots of mesh
so there was tons of airflow basically
but if you're putting a power supply up
there that does limit the airflow a
little bit so they've redesigned so you
can have air flow in taking from the
bottom and then exhausting at the top by
the way this side panel is rotatable so
your i/o which is part of the side panel
can be moved so you can put it in the
front here or in the top or you can even
flip it over and put it on the back side
of the case if you're going with the
vertical orientation you'll probably
want to put some of these handles on and
that will allow it to sit up off of the
ground to allow air flow in taking at
the bottom and then we also have
accessories including handles so a
variety of those so you can find a
handle that meets your needs and then
here's a couple little accents that they
have been working with just to give the
case a little bit of pop distinction
person eyes ability and then those of
course these mesh panels which you can
add to the case and coolermaster
actually designed a special one of these
for me they put my logo line which is
pretty cool of course they also did it
for gamers Nexus which is you know
obviously their logo is vastly inferior
to mine so Steve and I got in a little
bit of a fight over whose logo should go
on the case I think I what other
accessories include swappable panels I
like this one that has sort of a fabric
overlay to it and that's mainly because
if you're having your airflow come at
the bottom of the case you can add these
panels to the Front's to again give it a
more distinct look we have a more
standard steel panel as well as a
aluminum panel as well next is the
control pad we actually talked about
this awesome hardware at the live show
this was a Kickstarter that Coolermaster
put together because they wanted to
gauge interest in a product like this
the control pad itself has a wrist rest
down at the bottom it is magnetic it's
got a couple scroll wheels at the top
and then it's got a set of keys so you
can use those for left-right up-down or
of course you can reprogram them however
you want because coolermaster
anticipates that there might be lots of
people interested in something like this
like my editor Joe to that end we also
have a bunch of different key caps that
you can put on there these are actually
etched with different logos on them for
different functions they're also talking
about other options that allow you to
swap out keys if you switch between
different control modes and that's all
real nice but the main thing about this
keypad is that it is analog or at least
it's accepts analog input so they're
also making a large one for people with
very big hands that's the demo they have
here that's not actually true this is
just a demo to show how it actually
works it's infrared so there's an
infrared sensor on the bottom and that
will determine how far down the key cap
is pressed and that gives you analog
control so it's not just an on/off it
registers pressure in between and to
demonstrate this they have super hot
going on and this is actually a very
good example of it because of super hot
you can just die immediately
because in super hot you can move very
very slowly because time only moves when
you move in super hot so pushing the
keys down just a tiny bit moves you just
a little tiny bit it definitely gives
you a lot more flexibility and control
more of a gamepad experience in some
ways I would say but you can see how
this would be useful for gaming as well
as lots of other stuff too with the
various key cap sets they have for
Illustrator Premiere Pro FPS gaming
what's this one Oh
Photoshop if you're not aware
Coolermaster makes a ton of products not
just for you the consumer at home but
also various OMS this is just a close-up
of some of the technology I wanted to
show real quick for instance keep pipe
design like they did but the original
hyper 212 flattening that and putting it
right up against the CPU so you can have
more efficient transfer I've also done a
lot of work with vapor chambers here
which is more horizontal flow then flow
along the form of a heat pipe this is a
3d vapor chamber and they've actually
taken the vapor change chamber and added
vertical heat pipe sort of give you a
hybrid design they've integrated this
into a bunch of products so I just
thought it was kind of fun that they had
these breakouts here where you could see
the internals and I wanted to show you
real quick let's move on though at this
demo we have a couple products the
master box and our 400 new cage
on the left and then the XG advanced
which is a power supply over on the left
that's the right that's low now
coolermaster has gotten a lot of
critiques on the airflow from that guy
right there hi Steve hi you you've made
coolermaster make better products that's
just really good timing
so the NR 400 over here features a new
version of mesh that allows air flow
through but also blocks dusts and of
course this will need to be
independently tested in the future but
what they're telling me is that when you
have this on the front of a case it's
going to act as your dust filter but
it's right on the front so it's actually
kind of presentation worthy to which was
because it's a very fine mesh it
actually looks pretty clean so if you're
using your system over time you'll
probably start to see dust buildup right
on the front and that's will be more of
a visual indicator that you should
probably clean that keep your system
clean give yourself better airflow so I
think that's a good solution of course
we'll need to test it other than that
this case also features a flush tempered
glass side panel over here and of course
a power supply basemaps oh and look a
cooler master local power button here's
that XG 750 power supply it has a logo
on the side it has LED lighting and this
one is 80 plus bold rated does a digital
power supply cool masters finally
getting ready to launch these and
they're actually anticipating them
coming out in like 550 and 650 watt
versions which will be much more
reasonable for people who are just
building a standard gaming PC here's the
big brother of that NR 400 this is the
NR 680 ex we also have that micro dust
filter going on on the front which is
also wrapped around the entire front
panel there which is pretty cool and it
actually kind of does an interesting RGB
effect the RGB fans behind it kind of
projects onto it and it gives you kind
of an interesting overlapping look with
that which was kind of here here is look
at those front panels only real
difference between these is that that
one has a cutout for an optical drive
because there is space for an optical
drive bay at the top of this case they
also have a unique implementation with
these three front fans just to simplify
things for connecting up front fans
especially if you have fans and RGB they
have wired all three of these fans up to
a single set of cables so two cables and
one is a four pin PWM so you can just
plug it in if you just want the fans to
spin and then the secondary one with
three pin addressable RGB so you can
plug that in if you want the offense to
light up to
pretty damn it Steve
so obviously take your pick of what
design or logo you wanted here
coolermaster custom printed these for us
they're not going to necessarily be
offering these to everyone out there but
they just wanted to show some of the
options that are available and of course
to butter us up by showing us our logos
on their products and yes there's the
gamers Nexus logo as well you know it's
missing here we don't have a bit wit
logo obviously that one didn't make the
cut was wasn't high-quality enough and
last thing I wanted to talk about here
is this fan fans are important for
cooling cooling is what Coolermaster
does they're doing their best to
reinvent the fan and do it in their own
special way so first off instead of a
rifle bearing this fan uses double ball
bearings this is a prototype by the way
there's no name for it yet or estimated
release date but I like how it looks
because it's sort of different it's got
some brushed metal accents on the
outside which does look pretty cool I
think the Coolermaster logo hexagon is
right there in the middle too they have
a swept fan blade design with a ring
around the outside that allows the fan
blades to get very very close to the
outer ring of the fan and then I think
one of the parts I maybe like the most
is that the actual cables on this are
detachable you can unplug it it does
still have separate cables for RGB and
just the fan which is also very nice but
that's gonna help with daisy-chaining
connecting up multiple fans together and
cable management in general so guys
that's gonna wrap it up for my coverage
here at the cooler master suite Palms
Place Las Vegas Nevada thank you so much
for watching a big thank you of person
my sponsors for this event Coolermaster
of course as well as enter max Corsair
and deep cool stay tuned for more
coverage coming at you real soon hit the
thumbs up button anyway out I will see
you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
