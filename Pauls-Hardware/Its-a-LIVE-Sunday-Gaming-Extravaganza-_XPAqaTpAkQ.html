dropped 600 frames YouTube has dropped
zero though so this should be live in
like two seconds
as long as for some reason it doesn't
want me to do the manual transition even
though I told it not to do manual
transition oh it's going stream status
is good I got I got good on my stream
status alright cool
hi everyone welcome to this Paul's
hardware YouTube video normally I do
videos that are like edited and stuff
but this video is just going to be
playing video games the reason that I am
doing this stream with Kyle who's right
there next to me
is because we've been sort of on sort of
vacation and we had Computex and we had
a few other things going on in between
and we haven't done our live show that
we do every tuesday awesome hardware in
like a while and we kept promising
people that we would and we felt bad
about that so we are doing a live show
on Tuesday great right Kyle yes in two
days are we doing it from are we doing
it from your place alright so awesome
hardware will be back on Tuesday but in
the meantime we're just gonna sit here
and play some games and hopefully have a
good time byun is to go for about an
hour on youtube so that it's not too
long but then we are also streaming to
our twitch channels my twitch channel is
twitch.tv slash paul's hardware just
like my youtube channel so you can watch
on either one twitch we're probably
going to do kind of an after party and
continue gaming there a little bit
longer but that's kind of how it's going
oh we have an echo echoes probably oh
yeah people seem to like my mic better
than than yours okay
that's why we're so close together
alright so if you guys want to watch
both some leaks to be going on chat for
multi-stream you all you're going to be
able to hear on this stream is me
talking in my game and Kyle's separate
we don't have any any wired where we're
trying to keep things relatively simple
for this one but we're gonna start out
with some fortnight because you know
that's a popular game people are like
like to play right now but we have like
at least three four other games lined up
that we can also jump into in place so
all that said you're not
how do I add you
I don't know
I think it's just Paul sorry
okay
and request
and of us there yet hey so what is yours
can tell you're just doing
properly
I invited you know
let's get started pen is wondering what
hardware I'm using I am using arctic
panther discreetly
today so it's a 78 20 X which is a core
16 thread memory 32 gigs of memory water
cooling to 1080 T is I didn't update my
graphics drivers it's probably
I'm sure everything will be fine
all right I should check out chat and
every this is the music too loud I can't
turn that down just a smidge you know
Asus really wanted you to use that setup
to know so much oh we're in us we're in
a squad you shoot us four squads down oh
good that way we will be maybe have
someone to carry us hey mr. wolf good to
see you too thank you thank you yeah
sorry the voice is a little low on mine
you guys for Academy's turn to have to
turn me up I am at max volume on my mic
right now well I could I could do boost
a little bit are you are you in did you
jump out
I see mirages
I'm going after Mirage where's he headed
we're all kind of in the same area this
is the teamwork brilliant
ah just barely missed getting up there
this it's not like a I don't know what I
just consumed but I'm sure it's your dad
let's change our teammates gonna be fun
Drake I love you too tuck and roll yeah
don't worry guys this will not be the
only game I'm getting a few unzips here
in there but not not too bad
I'm also playing on windowed mode
because otherwise it would be widescreen
1080 60
I don't know what to tell you
game volume down thank you for the
feedback guys I will do that
how do you want a cue
Tunnel bear gives you better streams we
are not streaming through VPN right now
everyone seems to hate fortnight at
least there's a few people who hate for
me
what keyboard am i using right now I am
using I was I did have a cooler master
one here and I actually switched to this
one this is also from the ROG set that
they sent a bunch over for so it's that
one ROG this is called just call the
game cap it's ROG keyboard it's kinda
our GP at it I switched it cuz it's
Blair cheese that's it
ROG Strix Flair yes that's correct
and it
we could do final fight five teams of
twenty
Oh already you already hit hit go okay
let's do one here and then we'll try
that and then we'll switch games since
there's at least a few people a few
people who are not enthused about for
tonight at all I'm gradually lowering my
game audio for the stream guys eight
eight thousand yeah that's why it's so
clean
all right so left click is to shoot the
guns
yeah this what I haven't gotten down as
the building stuff need to remap the
keys for that I think oh yeah I have
beer - oh all right I'm following red
following red red and blue over here
YouTube doesn't know what they're
talking about it's got to be something
in this farmhouse right oh there is
oh my gosh I got a good gun like right
off the bat maybe drink this potion of
shielding yeah I got a purple purple gun
hit some bricks and some wood and stuff
all right we're in good shape
nothing could stop us now I should try
out the HyperX RGB keyboard I have not
not mess with that one before just like
blowing up the
piles of hay oh the heck oh the tires
pop you in there
see I'm learning all sorts of things
like collecting lots of wood is super
important what is there find someone
trapped now we do need to head sort of
in a southerly south southeasterly
direction I'm gonna check out this other
farmhouse okay well dance party yeah you
have to hit the blue spots to mine
faster Thank You ace geek that is very
helpful reminder to anyone watching that
I'm probably not good at this game at
all that makes sense it's coming in
handy already
all right I got so much lumber now just
like a I don't know what to say about it
be cool so you could drive around the
tractor all right Kyle groups moving
away from you
we have pub G but it had like a 12 gig
update they didn't wanted us to download
and so you know that that sucked and we
didn't let it finish it was gonna take
too long click them on the head what
happens if you click them on the head
follow us follow the line oh you got a
Gatling gun
I'm out a hundred Hertz monitor turning
off motion blurring game settings will
help with aiming while turning fast
Thank You dad
yeah I'm on 100 Hertz monitor the Acer
predator X 34 just been my gaming
monitor for a little bit here
my being shot I am being shot somebody's
throwing gas at me oh whoops a tennis
that will close the game Kyle this is
very and I need I need to heal myself we
have the same thing pretty much oh wow I
could use a bandage trap I never use the
traps well that's not helpful at all
we're like right on the edge of town
here what are the what are the little
markers are the markers our teammates
trying to help us by telling us where
they're going around we're useful things
they're showing up no I mean yeah this
looks like they're actually setting down
and doing doing useful helpful things
that you learn how to do after you play
the game for a while
it can deposit stone to get something
out of a vending machine what you're
plugged in you're not connected to be a
Wi-Fi I don't think got the rj45 should
be a hundred both ways ish gunshots
shoot again ooh five eyes you're sniping
fools up here it's pretty
all right I'm just gonna try to shoot it
whoever he shoot I can't tell where that
person might be looks like we're gonna
head towards this other little town down
to the south
but I think he's trying to get this kill
first I'm gonna help totally gonna help
I didn't help I laid down suppressing
fire
good job teammates I did nothing to
assist what is this
porta fort rockets what's the porta fort
useful at all range so many fun weapons
in this game all right
we're like right at the edge so maybe we
should get back to safe territory soon
better be 32 I feel like a 1950 ex
without 32 gigs of RAM would be I don't
know what what would happen
there's no bandwidth allocation going on
we're streaming to the same through the
same router which has no like special
rules set up or anything for that the
game is set to golf with friends oh
that's that's that wasn't my intent I
should change that if I can't offer have
to change that in between to keep in
mind see if I got back to the game
streaming more often I'm sure a lot of
these little details that the try to
account for would come back to me but as
of now like just getting the basics
together to stream was
I believe this stream both of our
streams are being powered by sunlight
right now as far as I can tell I haven't
I haven't checked the app Oh No get off
me
I'm down and down look at all these guns
and stuff don't shoot me
eliminated
being terrible at the game oops now I'm
getting loopback of audio hold on being
terrible no it's not yeah so if you
click on sorts of squads it'll go to the
different modes there's a final fight
with five teams of twenty where we could
let even more people potentially carry
us seems reasonable I did update wait I
need to exit the match I did update my
stream settings on Twitch guys so I'm
streaming to the right game now alright
I'm ready if you are
left over from awesome hardware like a
month month and a half ago give or take
no this youbrought but after but after
we finished these two beers we'll be
moving on to fan fan set beer which is
fun reaper what's better for streaming
YouTube or twitch we like almost always
stream to both at the same time so it's
kind of hard to say specifically I've
had a reasonably good experience with
both I've also had difficulty and you
know times where I wanted to where I
wanted to you know gouge my eyes out
with both so you know depends on the
situation yeah
so are we on a team of four or a team of
20 I think
oh yeah but it's it's for its small
groups all right did you jump out yeah
so it's a four-man squad but then five
five squats cuz yeah I see yellow I see
turquoise people on the maps here we're
touching down in Anarchy acres which is
always a good decision
I still don't know how to do the traps
why can't I put this trap down what do I
need to do to lay the trap alright I
don't screw that yep it's gun alright at
least people my teammates are not it's
hard to tell sometimes if they have the
yellow I'm sorry if they have white over
their heads their teammates is that is
that correct the white arrow alright and
we can see where they are and stuff it's
always helpful
alright figuring this out
put on wall or place a baseboard floor
down oh you actually have to put it on
like a wood piece of wood cabbages
cabbages yum yum yum
alright so seems like we're just hanging
out here with a bunch of friends which
is which is awesome like yeah there's
not much left - that's fine it means
we're surrounded by a bunch of
heavily-armed teammates who will protect
us thank you so for the multi twitch
stream link if you guys want to actually
watch both of us at the same time feel
free to click that and you can actually
hear what both of us say perhaps what is
it I'm following you for no good reason
and I feel like you're running off by
yourself and I don't know what you're
running towards right now though
slurp juice what is this circus I'm just
gonna give me oh it is oh it gives me a
regenerating shield that's it's kind of
fun okay where did everyone go Kyle I'm
going back towards the team I don't know
I don't know what your plan is we've
completely taken over Anarchy acres oh
this guy's got a bush - is that an item
you pick up or can you like hack down
the bush and then put it on okay I'm
gonna follow this guy who's a bush and
hide behind him guys other games that we
have sort of that we've actually loaded
up and have ready to play for after
we're done with fortnight which would
being another game or two includes
overwatch we got we have old-school
quake we have quake 3 arena which we
might jump into briefly we got csgo
we got golf with friends and I forget
what else do a few others that's good
that's good Kyle
oops that was me you crouch I oh really
oh okay thank you
I tried see an X and Z all the normal
yeah me too
just funny there's these two bushes
following me around
I have two guns but they're both like
the crappy quality
hello Pegasus you thanks for saying hi
yeah what's YouTube talk about no no
just being shot at if one's rinse for
the tree
I like this gaming mode for staying
alive for a longer period of time we're
not actively accepting friend requests
and stuff just because there's a lot of
them in it's challenge yeah
or chyann I mean we typically know the
basics of like a shooter game you know
it's sort of fundamentals of like you
know hiding and rough ability to aim
sometimes
look iron see but even if you're not a
good shot there's you know there's some
basics to strategy that can be helpful
you're shooting the things taketake the
push-off
people shooting it way over there
nothing to have a very good shot from
all the way across the map here with
this trap again
hippie
I don't have enough ammunition to reload
that's never a good sign
yeah mowing them down this is this
praying for the splash damage RNG
but you are you still alive
shut your bush off now that was a thing
hey Geo 787 yes I've I've had this
twitch account for gaming for quite some
time we used to use it to do after
parties after the live stream on awesome
harbour but since we sort of stopped
doing that cuz it was it made it a very
long evening but we're looking for ways
always looking for ways to do things
better I think I might have hit that guy
a little bit I might have taken a slight
amount of damage off you're just showing
over here by this brick wall
exactly
hello I'm being struck oh no Kyle
revived me I'm right next to you thank
you thank you very much totally back in
this nope I totally got shot Kyle I'm
dead next to you again
let's save me okay extra karma for that
right lovely
now what I should do here kind of
trapped in loot Lake yeah they're over
in like a much better position damn it
it's just got shot again sorry and I can
crawl over by the wall a little bit more
I'm down in the water
no Rowdies Rarity's got me thanks rowdy
I don't know how I'm not drowning
I'm just crawling around under the wire
I'm just gonna build walls here to
protect me as I slowly retreat
no one shooting me yeah I know the walls
closing down there's no way and there's
no Emil let's do this
oh wow I didn't even realize that was
about to close down so bad yeah weird
we're dead we're toast
ghosts yeah all right so I guess the
storm the storm wall closes in a lot
more quickly in the 2320 match I'm
slowly crawling towards you maybe maybe
I'll make it through this it at least
provides you with like some you know
some cover
when you're down in the water all right
all right so what should be should we do
one more of these or should we match up
games okay yeah given that it's a game
that some people actually know how to
play hero is here demanding that I that
I pet him all right leave match so
what's next do you wanna try some
overwatch
now try overwatch sure clay core
let's try quake I kind of kind of just
cuz it's old it's from 2007 quick three
I should say I hear oh yes yes I'd love
to just pet you all the time yeah since
we've never really tried it much let's
let's go for that thanks Lyle you guys
for joining us if you've just stopped in
we're just doing a little live stream
gaming on this Sunday morning having a
beer on Sunday morning which is also fun
we're probably only gonna aim for about
an hour or so to stream to our YouTube
channels but we're gonna go on Twitch a
little bit longer we're streaming do
streaming both to twitch that TV slash
Paul's hardware my twitch channel as
well as YouTube youtube.com slash Paul's
hardware
alright so quake oh good I had I had to
do that in quit it did lock up on me at
least once
alright I'm gonna try you did I need to
double-check that this is capturing
really all so he can have no idea how to
actually join each other and multi-play
well i won't load

you try not to marina okay Kevin that we
haven't played or tested these at all
we'll see all right server is local I'm

need to start it refresh it again oh my
gosh quake 3 yeah probably
oh this is just local is it just gonna
be one on one
I can see them side-by-side yeah plasma
gun yeah there you go it's there
yeah probably more familiar with quake 2
Maps actually than this this is a pretty
small map for money

just this tiny little 2-3 room set up
here this mouth leads to shrink dur
whatever the heck that is
I get those armored shirts your talks
I'm tied for the lead

issues with that too so maybe we should

armor can go up to 200 but then it
slowly drops back down to 200
you're okay now

California and the temperatures not bad
not too bad at all actually
the AC is tied to the grid but when it
runs it does pull power from the power
wall I've had this one for quite some
time and I've found no need no reason or
need to change from it this was like a
$200 headset when it when it was
available this one that they don't sell
this one anymore yeah

just chaos

prevent the payload slowly moving it
backwards over here
nothing
