2017 coverage I am at Coursera I'm going
to start off talking about what Coursera
is most well known for at least what
they started off with I think in the PC
space which is memory what they've done
here is taking their vengeance memory
modules that have LEDs in them like
these over here and they've made them
RGB because as soon as it give people
the ability to have lights in their
memory people like we want those lights
to be able to be different colors so as
a vengence RG p RGB series we're
expecting it later this quarter so it's
not quite ready yet but they've been
working on developing the software so
that course Airlink which integrates
with that with them you can control each
LED individually you can control them as
a group you can assign different groups
with different profiles to them and then
you can go in here and adjust different
effects of course so you can change the
effect of how quickly the colors change
and make it faster or slower many of the
effects that you might expect when it
comes to like breathing and color change
and that kind of thing is already
integrated here even though they're
still using kind of a beta version of
the software so that's pretty cool
there's a challenge with integrating RGB
LEDs because they don't have any
external wires or anything like that
connected to it so it's all controlled
directly through the dim slot or the the
it's powered through the dim slot and
communicates with the motherboard
through the dim slot but it also has
actually the capability to store your
profile on the memory module itself so
if you haven't installed in the system
and configure stuff with the corsair
link software you can take the dims out
put it in a put them in a different
system and I'll keep doing the RGB cycle
or whatever
profile that you set up so that's kind
of cool I wanted to really quickly
mention this right here the fourth
series MP 500 it's been a while since
Corsair came out with the new SSD so
they decided to jump up to the newest
and fanciest type of SSD that you can do
which is an m2 SSD with nvme support
there's not a whole lot to say about it
other than that it's got a nice black
PCB so I'm just going to blend in with
your build pretty nicely but if yellow
accents on the label as far as what they
have here available in 120 240 and 480
gig capacities m2 2280 form factor and
they don't have the read and write
speeds listed here so I don't know what
they are but I think they're pretty good
I believe the reads are well over 2000
and the writes are in the 1 to 2
thousand range but don't quote me on
that
I'm planning on getting one of these and
a video on it so I'll bring you more
information on that when it's available
over here we have a new series of power
supplies and these are budget series
power supplies they've had the CM series
for quite a while you know those are the
power supplies that are very good and
get the job done but Kyle and I constant
help constantly tell people to upgrade
them when they have them in systems
because he got a pee off the label
because it was kind of a brighter green
color and then the cabling itself was
not quite as appealing as it could have
been that ketchup and mustard going on
so Coursera's replacing that with a TX
series right here they have a 556 57 50
and 850 watt versions they're partially
modular but the cables as you can maybe
see here are all black so budget power
supply course air quality no hideous
colors that might mismatch with your
build and and give ya get a new power
supply also the HX Series has been
updated removed basically they've
removed the I from it it's just the HX
whatever not like the 1200 I like they
have over there they gutted the Corsair
link capabilities from these power
supplies so they're more straightforward
power supplies but by doing that they
can reduce the price by they said about
$20 per unit and finally we have the
product that I think Corsair was most
excited about which is the newest
version of their K 95 keyboard which is
called the K 95 RGB platinum because
everything that's platinum is usually
the best that's possible but basically
the way Corsair has updated the previous
K 95 so I've added a light bar across
the top it's got 18 18 different LED
illumination areas and they're all very
smooth so you can't really tell where
the LEDs are so as its doing a nice
effect across there you don't like to
see oh there's an LED and there's an LED
it's just sort of a nice fluid motion of
course you're going to have the Corsair
software available for these which is
insanely powerful and what you can do is
when it comes to configurations and
stuff and they have community members
who have dropped in a profile so you can
load up and that kind of thing which is
really cool
they've taken the G keys over here the
macro keys and they've narrowed it down
to just a single row which is a little
bit simpler and those do have texture on
them so you can feel if you're touching
those or touching the keys next to them
this one is using cherry MX speeds which
is which Corsair recently
just this past year and I believe
they're going to have him in other
varieties as well but you know the speed
switches are unique to Corsair right now
from cherry so they're trying to push
those as much as possible it's got the
features that you already had and still
wants like your media controls in the
top right and it's got a nice feature
for the rest wrist rest which is this
little magnetic piece right here so if
you like a little bit more texture you
can flip it to one side feel like a
little bit more smooth flip it to the
other and a magnet just holds it in
place so you can easily change your
wrist rest up the final thing is that
it's got eight megabytes of internal
memory so of course any of the profiles
that you save you can save internally
even if they're more complex ones like
RGB profiles and then you have three
internal profiles you can switch between
using that button on the top left so you
don't need the Corsair software
installed if you take this keyboard and
use it on a different computer something
like that this keyboard is supposed to
come out in q1 I believe in that means
should be in the next month or two and
I'm supposed to get one and do a review
on it so you should be seeing a little
bit more coverage on this in the near
future but that's all we have here from
the Corsair suite except one last thing
I wanted to show you which is just some
soft shots of this pink system that they
built which is diva themed which made me
think I needed to steal it and give it
to my wife because she really likes to
play diva is a really cool build I mean
you don't see pink builds too often it's
water cooled inside everything is custom
doubt there's diva logos everywhere I
just thought it was pretty badass and
they ship this over from Taiwan so it
did get a little messed up during
shipping but fortunately it's still
working even though they had to clean up
the pink fluid inside the spill that's
all from Corsair guys so thanks again

more CES 2017 coverage coming from Las
Vegas Nevada we'll see you soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
