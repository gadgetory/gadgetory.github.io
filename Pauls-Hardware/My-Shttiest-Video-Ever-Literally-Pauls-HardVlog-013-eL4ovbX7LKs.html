that's a video I'm calling my worst
video ever because it's a vlog and it's
a video that I'm doing not because I
felt like it would be a good video but
because I feel like there's some stuff I
need to do and if I don't make a video
out of it then there's not going to be a
video so here it is so I want to call
this like a day in my life type video
because I definitely didn't start off
today intending to do that but I do want
to talk about three things and show you
three things that I tend to need to do
in my day to day life that doesn't
really associate with making videos but
there are things that take up a pretty
significant amount of my time and just
to practice I know I don't necessarily
have the busiest life or anything like
that like you're not only kids right now
or that kind of thing but yet somehow I
seem to constantly run out of time so
the three things I'm going to talk about
are one exercise that if you can't tell
actually just got back from a fairly
brisk walk not not not anything huge
anything like that just went like a
couple miles around my neighborhood here
I wouldn't normally bring the dogs along
on something like that but Kira decided
to get a little frisky before I left
okay know and he kind of pissed me off
and so I went without them so I feel bad
I was a bad I was a bad copy father for
that instance but but that does relate
to the second thing I'm talking about
which is of course the dogs again I
don't have any kids right now but I do
have two puppies and they do require a
bit of attention well a lot of attention
a lot of the time and then the third
thing is going to be my house here
because my wife and I are lucky enough
to have been able to purchase a home
about three years ago or at least get a
mortgage on a home but since it's our
home it requires lots of upkeep and
maintenance and since my wife works
full-time I tend to handle a lot of that
stuff the domestic work around here and
the main issue I'm doing today's video
the way I am is because of the backyard
but we'll get to that in just a second
so look clear with the help thing even
I'm showing you guys nori right now
health-wise I am
you know I'm not terribly out of shape
or anything like that but I could do
better and that is part of the reason
why I have this now this is a garmin
vivoactive HR I'm not big into wearables
or anything like that but this has a
heart rate monitor it does step tracking
and all that good stuff has some other
functions in there as well
brief pause well hero takes a drink the
things that I found out in particular
after getting this which I've had since
a little bit before Christmas wife my
wife got us each one of these because
she's actually been doing a great job
getting into shape as well is it does
step tracking and one thing I realized
from working at home for a couple years
now is that I don't get like nearly as
many steps as I did when I would go out
and about so if you see that blue bar it
goes across the top that's after doing a
couple miles walk this morning and I
still have a lot more steps that I will
hopefully get in today so this has made
me realized that I was really being just
way way too sedentary in my lifestyle
but hopefully that it's helping and it's
definitely been encouraging me to do the
walks a little bit more regularly I
would like to improve the exercise even
beyond that I'm not sure if I'm you know
considered doing something like eating a
bike like like Jays been doing he's been
doing really good with that or there's
other options too I might even join a
gym or that kind of thing who knows
that's them
I don't know if you guys have any ideas
feel free to leave those in the comments
link number two though is of course our
wonderful puppies right here so this is
hero
we've had hero for about a year now his
name is spelled h iro just in case
you're wondering he is a pitbull Mastiff
mix and he's actually a little bit older
he when we got him they said they
thought he was seven years old so he
came in as a senior and he is just a
wonderful dog he's super mellow most of
the time he's incredibly loving he just
wants you to pet him all the time so
that's that's very nice however as you
can tell you know he's got really
severely cropped ears and some other
stuff that made us think like whoever
his previous owners were I mean apart
from allowing him to go out on the
streets where he was for a few months
before we got him
not sure how good they were about like
training him for walks and stuff like
that so he can be a little tough to walk
he pulls a lot I've been working with
him to try to get him better at that but
it can be frustrating so although most
of the time he's very mellow and he just
wants to see if we can get him to go
over for belly rubs you got belly rubs
yeah we go yes he just loves getting his
belly scratched
that's pretty he'll just lie here
forever I'll let you do that
so anyway though he doesn't know how big
he is he's 95 pounds so he can only when
he gets excited and he only gets excited
in a couple different scenarios which is
if I come home after I've been out for a
while
or if he realizes that we're about to go
for a walk so when I was preparing to go
for a walk this morning and doing the
stuff like putting my running shoes on
he noticed and he got super excited and
then he when he gets excited
Noorie starts to get upset and she
starts to bark a little bit and then he
ended up jumping up at me and like kind
of swatting the side of my face and it
irritated me and I was like I don't want
to go on a walk and be irritated so I
just went without him so I'm sorry hero
and so you didn't go for your walk this
morning but um well we'll need to take
you out later today and no he's over
there like we you didn't take me either
I didn't do nothing no he's a good girl
we got an arrow and she's a puppy and so
um you know she kind of makes here look
bad sometimes when it comes to going for
walks because she's pretty good at it I
mean she's had the benefit of training
since she was quite young but we're
working with Hiro and he will get better
so here is my backyard and wow there's
there's honestly nothing special about
my backyard my backyard is not even
supposed to have anything growing in it
well you notice there's lots of greenery
right now and of course
nari is working to scare off cows the
cows that are up on the hill over there
but yeah my backyard is basically like a
big dirt lot most of the time but a
couple times a year it rains here in
Southern California and then the entire
thing just springs up into wildlife
greenery and vegetation which you know
might look very vibrant right now but
since about the beginning of January
when I was at CES it has been raining
like
very regularly so between the rain and
things being wet and dogs using it as
the restroom at here and me having zero
time to get out here to do anything
about it so I now have all this growth
out here and again as green and vibrant
as it might look there is dog guys
like every underneath all this in this
terrible situation so this is what it
comes down to for me for today I'm going
to just need to spend the next several
hours of the case in point wherever
there here here is doing a visual
demonstration why don't you just spend
the next few hours
just like weed whacking all this and
trying to pick my way in between the dog
 and it's not going to be fun so
that's why this is the worst video ever
and I'm making time less of this and
force you guys to watch it so wish me
luck ah this is not going to be fun here
goes doggies
well this third is done not only took
like a couple hours I realized that the
lawnmower here is doing a much better
job and that this is as an effective
tool the weed whacker here but
definitely takes a lot of time so I'm
sweet only all this still to go
okay the Sun is starting to go down so I
am calling it here because I need to
look into setting up some for dinner and
stuff here's as far as I got over here
and all the way over to like almost
there so I kind of caught it off that
cutoff there there's like a little bit
of a fade or something so I guess I'll
call this like something like two thirds
maybe maybe three quarters that I got
finished so to continue the shittiness
of this video I didn't even finish I
guess I got to make it a two-parter
right I'm just kidding I'm not going to
make it a two-parter but Wow I don't
even know what I look like right now I'm
probably pretty like sweaty and I have
grass and all over me and I'm
really thirsty I ran out of water a
while ago and I need to get more but
there's like stuff all over my feet so I
can't really go inside anyway so I'm
complaining a lot now what I should be
looking at is the idea that I spent the
day outside I did I did get my steps in
I'm I'm up I'm up to that so that is
something positive that we can finish
this video with anyway I hope you guys
have thought this video sucked because I
certainly didn't think much for myself
in fact I'm nice I would I would be
mature as I was doing this if I was
going to post it or not but now we'll
see we'll see how it actually turns out
when I'm all finished rendering time
lapses and stuff anyway guys I'll be
back soon with an actual video about
technology that's not me working my
backyard I hope you have a wonderful
rest of your day I'm going to go shower
because I really really need it see you
next time
