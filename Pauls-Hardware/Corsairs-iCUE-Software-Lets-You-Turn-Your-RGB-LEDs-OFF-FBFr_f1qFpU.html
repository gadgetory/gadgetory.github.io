to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake hey guys I'm at
Corsair the lighting in here is a little
weird so apologize for that but they
have really cool lighting but things
which is strange but anyway point being
I'm going to take a look at a couple
more cases as well as the IQ software
which Corsair has been developing to
give you the maximum amount of control
possible over your RGB LEDs it's like a
look let's start out right here the
vengeance RGV probes successor to the
vengeance LED kits that they came out
with last year these are pretty they've
basically redesigned the top beam they
have individual addressable LEDs so that
means they're compatible with the new IQ
software the developments
beyond this I mean it's it's
aesthetically different they are also
running these at higher speeds so they
did have a kit over here that's running
at a pretty high frequency 4700 speed
cache latency 19 so it was pretty
impressive they are expecting to
actually launch this kits
later this year so probably in another
few months so you might be able to
actually get it by its install the XMP
setting and get some fast memory up and
running next up is IQ that's I see Yui
also sounds like you're really smart too
this is the advancement of the software
and if you guys remember last year at
Computex I did a very specific video on
this or I covered it in great detail
because if that was really cool Mercer
is working to try to get all of the LEDs
working together on your systems with
supper you can still see all the
connected devices right now they have an
RGB Platinum k95 keyboard and RGB Mouse
wireless headsets a RGB headset stands a
mouse mats a h1 50 I Pro the power
supply the Vengeance RGB Pro memory in
there as well as a commander Pro that's
connecting
fans in the LED strips there's no way
I'm gonna be able to explain all the
different features of the software but
for one it has a full mode where you can
actually go in and individually select
different devices to control them if
you're controlling the vengence RGB Pro
memory for example you can individually
sect select the LEDs on it you can even
flip them or rearrange them since
different motherboards have different
layouts for the DIMM slots and some of
them have clips DIMM slots just so he
can make sure the LEDs are going in the
right direction
when it's in the full mode it's actually
going to use up some CPU resources so
they also have a slim mode where you can
pop it over to the side that will use
less resources if you're doing some
overclocking or system stress testing
your corsair IQ software will not be
eating up CPU cycles and also text it
away over the side so you can still
access all of the monitoring features
because there's tons of monitoring
features for system fan speeds
temperatures and you can rearrange those
you can take a specific temperature and
break it out so you can rearrange all
the boxes so it's very modular you can
basically set it up how you want it to
look another cool feature is just the
simple access for single color lighting
so if you're finding the controls to be
a little too complex for you you can
just go up there select the single color
and change your entire rig or your
entire set of our GPS to that single
color there's a whole range of lighting
effects in here too so they're taking
advantage of the switch over to
investable individual RGB LEDs they they
had a red white and blue theme that was
pretty cool some full color themes some
dual color themes I think they're all
quite pretty especially if you get the
entire RGB set up like Corsair has going
on here and then you can also attach the
software it's a specific application
logic so for example if you queue up a
movie you can have it set to
automatically turn all the fans off not
just the RGB Xin the fans but also the
fans themselves to keep the system
running nice and quiet that's doing a
fairly simple task of playback movie and
then you can watch your movie in silence
and without any lights from your RGB
LEDs and then switch back up and they
all become agreat back on oh and while
I'm here here's a look at the Obsidian
series 500d RGB spec
Editions the Obsidian 500 d has been out
for a little bit this one has been
updated it's going to come with some
individually addressable RGB LED fans
now the special edition is going to cost
about a hundred bucks more than the
standard 500 d but it does come with a
three pack of the individually
addressable 120 millimeter of course
there are GV LED fans that you can see
installed right here and also comes with
a commander pro so if you look at buying
those things retail you are getting a
bargain by getting this all together and
with this case and the slightly tinted
tempered glass windows the RGB LEDs do
look quite nice so I think it's a nice
option for anyone who wants to get the
package and get themselves started on
the road to RGB goodness and finally
here's the crystal series 280x and 280x
RGB the white version is the 280x
RGB this is a micro ATX case which is a
form factor that I really like and it's
cool to see more cases embrace this form
factor for motherboards not quite as
tiny as mini ITX but you still get some
expandability options there
so the - ATX RGB version will come with
a couple 120 millimeter ll series RGB
fans as well as a lighting note Pro so
again you can get yourself up and
running with RGB LEDs still has the same
features and layout of the other case so
you got tempered glass on the top the
front as well as the left side IO panel
has your basic couple USB 3.0 ports mic
headphone
power and reset button and they have put
some dust filters on the top front
intakes here's a look at the black
version without a system in it so you
can sort of get it a little bit better
idea of the layouts that's got the two
chamber design so it's a little bit
wider of a case but you can put the
power supply on the right side your
system goes in the left side and lastly
they do have a thousand be here that's
all decked out with of course there are
GB LEDs and IQ software but I don't need
to show you guys that because I've
already done two videos on 1000d and yes
I'm gonna be following at
on those videos with a water cooling
setup in there and I'll definitely be
trying out the IQ software too because
it's nice that that new version has come
out with a lot more functionality and
I'm definitely gonna get that system set
up so it's just beautiful with lots of
specialized RGB light effects so if
you're interested in that video
definitely hit the subscribe button down
there hit the thumbs up button on this
video if you enjoyed it I will be back
with more coverage from Computex 2018
very soon and of course a big thank you
to my sponsors gigabyte coolermaster
Thermaltake and team group thanks for
watching guys and we'll see in the next
one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
