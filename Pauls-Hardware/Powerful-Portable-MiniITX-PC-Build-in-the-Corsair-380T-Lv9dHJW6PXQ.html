excellent
what's up everybody if you watch my
channel you know that every month I like
to do a builds video I usually start the
month by doing a couple parts list
planning the video out and then I build
the computer which I'm doing in this
video right now and then I followed up
with some testing and benchmarking
numbers now I actually got a little bit
behind in November so we're doing
November's build right now but I'm kind
of overlapping it with December's build
and I have some plans for this system
coming up as well that have evolved over
the past few weeks so what I have here
is a build in the Corsair 3 ADT it's a
mini ITX system and although it's not
the best possible mini ITX system that I
could build like I planned out in
November it is a mini ITX system that I
can take on the road and use not just
for gaming but also for video editing
since I'm planning on taking this to CES
in Las Vegas in January this means that
in the description you'll find links to
all the parts that I'm using in this
system today I'll also put a PC part
picker list for something that I find to
be a reasonable in-between middle of the
road system in this case using many of
the same components but with a few
things swapped out here and there to
make it more reasonable if any of you
are actually looking into purchasing a
system like this lastly I had couple
products from Galax arrive just earlier
this week
galux formerly known as galaxy I haven't
worked with since I worked at Newegg a
few years ago you actually can't
purchase Galax products from anywhere in
the US unless you purchase them directly
to the Galax webstore so I'll post a
link to that down in the video's
description and I have their geforce gtx
1070 the XOC sniper version as well as
some of their hall-of-fame memory which
looks pretty nice it's the 16 gig kit
clocked at 3600 megahertz so there's a
couple pretty nice products from galaxy
I'm actually really looking forward to
seeing how well this card performs there
gtx 1070 so i'll be doing some
overclocking and testing benchmarking
performance on that in the next video
the follow-up to this one so that's the
graphics card in the memory the case I'm
going to be using today of course is the
Corsair 380 t it's a little large for a
mini ITX case and it's a little bit more
on the expensive side but I like that it
has a handle on top as well as plenty of
ventilation as well as plenty of space
in there for
not only the parts but also cable
management the motherboard is going to
be the z170 and Wi-Fi from gigabytes and
this was more of a board that I just had
on hand and I know it'll work I've
already tested this board with
overclocking with the 6700 K and it's
not as good of an overclocker although
it has the other features I want which
includes an m2 on the back as well as
Wi-Fi integrated I will have a link in
the description for the Asus board that
I ended up using for my wife's builds
that I think might be a better bet if
you're planning on doing some serious
overclocking but for my purposes this
one will work just fine the cpu of
course is the Intel Core i7 6700 K which
i think is going to be the best bet for
this size and form factor yes you could
go with like the enthusiast series
platform in an LGA 2011 - three option
but I think that's quite overkill from
any ITX and more suited for a micro ATX
or full sized ATX build to keep the CPU
cool I have the cry Rig h7 I've used
this before looks nice performs well is
very reasonably priced and then of
course I have power in the form of the
EVGA 650 GQ power supply a very solid 80
plus gold mostly modular power supply
some really good deals on this over the
Black Friday and Cyber Monday weekend by
the way and then rounding things out
with storage I have plenty of storage
all SSDs and three different
configurations first off for the
operating system I have a Plextor m6e
this is an MDOT to drive it's not nvme
so it's not going to be as fast as like
the new samsung 960 for example but it
will be faster than a typical SATA
ConnectedDrive 256 gig is just fine for
my operating system as well as some
applications for a really fast storage
array I have two SanDisk Extreme two
SSDs into both 240 gig so I'm going to
put these in raid 0 that will give me
about 480 gigs of usable space and it
will be much faster with the raid
configuration finally have a single
SanDisk Ultra SSD this is a one terabyte
or 960 at least and again this was one
that there was a really good deal on
just recently over the Black Friday and
Cyber Monday weekend I got another one
for a hundred and eighty dollars so
those are all the parts I'm using let us
move on to ye old build montage brought
to you by the power of editing
so there it is guys and I must say I am
very happy with how this build turned
out it is not light I would say but I
can lift it up for transportation and
then I like the look of it overall I
like how the LEDs on the galaxy graphics
card kind of peak through here the edge
lit LEDs around the edge of it as well
as the LEDs in the fans I got a white
LED on the fan on the front for the
intake as well that lights up so it
gives you sort of the illusion of like
some hidden power within the smoky glass
windows and and the dust filtration that
they have up here it's really quiet
right out of the you know with doing
nothing I've done nothing other than set
the fan controller to the lowest speed
and I also want to say it's a very nice
to have a fan controller built in there
since mini-itx boards often are really
slim on fan headers so the fan
controller allows you to do three speed
fan control for either PWM or three pin
voltage control fans also quite nice so
let's left now is to move on to some
testing I'm going to be loading Windows
10 under this doing some performance
metrics I'll do some games and I think
I'll do some video editing as well
if you guys have any comments or
suggestions for me for what you'd like
to see tested on this system leave them
in the comments section down below thank
you of course for watching this video as
always and don't forget that the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed it comments are
always welcome also down there is links
to my store where you can buy shirts
mugs and pint glasses so thanks again
for watching as always guys and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
