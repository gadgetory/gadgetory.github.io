Pauls hardware today's video is gonna be
some follow-up testing benchmarking QA
and all that good stuff about my july
build which is right here it's a $1200
build that's made for mid to high end PC
gaming it's also totally VR capable
it's also got a really nice black and
red color scheme and I was going for not
like the cheapest build I could get but
reasonable parts parts that I know you
can overclock I know that we're going to
perform well and are you gonna get a lot
of lifespan out of and ultimately I'm
really really happy with how the bill
turned out so starting off with what I
liked about this build is that
everything is pretty much off-the-shelf
there was no modding or customization
that was needed to be done with this
build I didn't even need to dig into my
own personal collection of like random
little PC components and cables and
connectors and stuff to put anything
together everything you see here was
used from all the stuffs that came in
the boxes with all the parts that I have
listed in the build list parts list down
in the description so check that out if
you're interested in any of these parts
individually or there's a PC perk picker
build list where you can see everything
all together with a price point still
right around $1,200 I also really like
everything turned out with the color
scheme since it shows the EVGA power
supply with the all black cables there's
nothing really that stood out as garish
or not fitting in with the rest of the
color scheme of this build so that was
nice to finally I like that it's all
air-cooled we got the cryo rig h7 cooler
up here and of course air-cooled
graphics card as well there's not gonna
be any worries here about a pump failing
in the future or leaks happening granted
liquid coolers are nice and I've done a
lot of liquid cooling in the past but
there's something to be said for just a
nice simple air-cooled system especially
when you're not paying 100 bucks plus
for a liquid cooler since the Kyrie gage
Civic h7 only cost about $35 on the
downside though there were a couple
things that were less than perfect and I
will start out with a bit of a mistake
or just an oversight on my part and that
is when it comes to the motherboard now
this is a very solid motherboard from
MSI the z1 78 gaming m3 and it's more
reasonably priced it's less than $150
most of the places that you look however
the Amazon listing for this motherboard
which is what I first checked out and
blindly accepted the thing down here
which is wait where did it go multi-gpu
supports this motherboard supports SLI
and crossfire it says
on the Amazon product page if you scroll
down a little bit further though it's
got a comparison of the m7 m5 and m3 and
you'll find that it's actually only
crossfire x2 way support the reason for
that is that the second by 16 PCIe slot
on this motherboard is only wired up 4
by 4 it's physically full-length but its
wired at 4 by 4 so rather than being
able to get by 8 and by 8 when you have
2 cards installed it actually will still
do by 8 and by 4 and by 4 is not enough
for official SLI support from Nvidia I
think that's probably a segmentation
thing that MSI did intentionally with
this motherboard and for most people
it's probably not going to be an issue
since most people don't end up doing SLI
configurations that's pretty rare but I
wanted to point that out here in case
any of you guys we're thinking I wanna
buy this build wait 3 4 6 months or
something and then grab another 10 70
definitely double check that motherboard
choice and to give you guys a little bit
better idea of just how minor the change
actually is if you can find a slightly
more reasonable reasonably priced 1070
like here's the 1070 gaming 8g it's not
the gaming X or whatever this one is
supposed to be 20 bucks or so cheaper
than the than the one that I chose here
it is on Newegg where it's actually
listed properly but hey look it's even
in stock right now really that's insane
anyway
440 bucks so you can save you know 10 or
20 bucks by getting not the gaming X
version of the GPU and then I went over
here and did another PC part picker list
where you can see dropping the price of
the GPU down a little bit
like down to 430 or something which I
did with the 1078 gig card which is not
black and red and one anyway I'm doing
this more for proof of concept but
anyway a slightly cheaper 1070 and a
slightly more expensive motherboard this
is the gaming m5 which has 170 bucks as
opposed 250 and the price is still
roughly the same 1212 dollars at least
stick your bike in the United States and
yes my sympathies are with any of you
guys in the comments who posted that
like wow this deal sure deal in the u.s.
here in my country it's exponentially
more or maybe not exponentially but it
feels that way one other thing I will
point out when it comes to negatives and
this one was really minor but a few
people did point out in the comments
that I did not take these power cables
and route them
straight down because there is a gap
here for the s340 that allows pretty
clean routing of those cables these are
actually two individual six pin or six
pin plus six pin peg connectors or at
least eight pin plus they both have two
plugs on the end with the daisy chain
thing on the end and I really hate how
that looks when it comes to this right
here so I routed them both up here and
I'll show you guys a closer look but
actually have a velcro strap here
holding back those extra two plugs that
come off of either one so from the front
here and from the look through the
window it looks pretty clean but there's
actually a bit of a bubble right here in
the middle of it so not ideal that's
just how the cabling came from EVGA you
could you could like mob the cables and
snip those off if you really wanted to
I've done that before but I didn't want
to do anything that would void a
warranty that kind of thing anyway let's
move on to some actual testing at an
overclocking temperature testing noise
testing first off overclocking all right
so my 6600 K got up to four point four
gigahertz with pretty much no problems
at all didn't even have to touch the
voltage motherboard automatically juiced
it up to about one point two seven five
volts which is perfectly reasonable
that's about what I would expect most
people could get out of a sixty six
hundred K without too much trouble I
could probably push it for five or four
six but again I wanted to keep things
reasonable for folks who are trying to
sort of replicate this build for
temperatures with the CPU at stock with
the ambient temperature around 26 to 28
degrees Celsius my CPU was idling at 26
to 29 Celsius and while I was gaming it
hit 52 degrees Celsius I then added in
the overclock 4.4 gigahertz again idling
jumped up a little bit but it was still
pretty minimal 29 to 32 degrees Celsius
was what I was monitoring at 68 C was
what it got up to while gaming and then
when I did it I 264 stress test it hit
82 C which is you know warmer than it
would run at stock but still well within
a range of what I would accept for a
gaming overclocked especially with
pretty simple and inexpensive air cooler
in there as far as GPU temps I didn't
overclock the GPU since I just used the
msi OC mode that it comes with or is
available with the msi software but the
GPU is idling at 55 C and that's what
the fans not spinning spinning it also
making no noise and then while gaming
the max I got up to with the side panel
on and after gaming
a long period of time with 72 degrees
Celsius also well within range very cool
for a gtx 1070 so this build overclocks
beautifully and temperatures are very
reasonable what about noise listen for
yourself
if you guys can hear the fans are
spinning but when I'm at a reasonable
distance it's you can't really hear
anything let's move on to some testing
we'll start off with 3d mark tests these
are of course candid benchmarks so that
runs them and I get a score firestrike
extreme hit eight thousand sixty-three
overall and nine thousand twenty eight
on the graphics switching up to fire
strike Ultra hit 4400 seven overall and
44:57 with the graphics then I through
time spy on there that's the new direct
x12 benchmark from 3d mark overall score
was 57 64 graphic score was six thousand
43 and the CPU score was 4570 again I'm
running all these tests with the
overclock enabled on the CPU and now
let's move on to some game testing I'm
going to be doing doom with Vulcan GTA 5
Metro last light and overwatch and I'm
running all these tests at 2560 by 1440
because I feel like that's probably the
resolution that would be the sweet spot
for this particular build
finally I did grab a couple questions
from the comments section on the video
the original build video of course this
one's from John Stewart well a five
hundred power supply be enough for this
build I created on PC part picker it
only needed 376 watts is wondering if I
went overkill
this is slight overkill but I always
like to go a little bit more than what
is expected for the power supply most
graphics cards where you look for your
minimum wattage requirement so usually
it's around 500 or 550 watts for most
modern GPUs sometimes as low as 450 or
even less if you're getting a lower end
one
I like having overhead though I like
having extra room in case I want to
expand of course I already mentioned the
potential SLI snafu with this build but
if you were going for instance dual four
80s for example or you did upgrade that
motherboard to the m5 version and he did
go SLI you would want a bit of extra
power available and then you wouldn't
have to swap out the entire PSU and all
that kind of thing that said just make
sure you get something quality make sure
you get something that's well reviewed
Johnny guru techpowerup really good
reviews for power supplies they need to
be well built because even if you're
looking at a PC part picker build and
it's saying oh you need this many watts
you also have to deal with potential
spikes often when you first power up a
computer for example it can spike and
draw a lot more wattage than sort of the
minimum or mean value that you would get
that's probably not the right usage of
that term but it can spike up a lot so
that's why you want to have a little bit
of extra Headroom that said 500 watts
you should still be fine with this build
as long as you're not going for SLI or
an extremely inexpensive power supply
next question from bass player why use
an air cooler on the CPU water is cheap
and better and quieter a good point
water cooling is definitely something
that's fun and can get you lower
temperatures and even some better
overclocking depending on the situation
but air cooling does have its benefits
as well so air cooling for example never
has the potential to have a pump fail if
you heard ever had a pump fail on all in
one liquid cooler it can be a pain in
the ass if the pump fails and you don't
find out about it your CPU can overheat
and just automatically shut down your
system and if you're in a situation like
I've been in the past and you're in the
middle of booting for example you can
like lose a raid array or that kind of
thing that has happened to me and few
other people I know also liquid coolers
do have the potential to leak granted
rare but that is something that's
possible air coolers can fail but if the
fan fails on an air cooler the fan just
stops working the air cooler heatsink
and everything still works so you won't
have quite as catastrophic failure as
you would if you had a pump failure on a
liquid cooler so that's one of the good
reasons to go with it I mean there's
benefits pros and cons to either side
but hey that's why we make videos on the
internet about building computers that
is all for this video though if you guys
enjoyed it of course hit the thumbs up
button let me know you enjoyed I'm going
to be doing this again next month so
just in a few more days it's going to be
August I'll be doing August builds very
soon so stay tuned to my Twitter and my
youtube channel for those and as always
