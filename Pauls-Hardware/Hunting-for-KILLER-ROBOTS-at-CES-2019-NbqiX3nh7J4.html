you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master
so guys I have made my way over to the
Las Vegas Convention Center this is
unprecedented I normally spend all my
time over in hotel suites and I never
get to come here and I'm really excited
because CES always has a bunch of robots
so that's gonna be the goal of this
video not just robots but robots that
are specifically designed to hunt the
most dangerous game that's great
killer robots I bet they have some in
here we're gonna find it Cobra del G we
have Chloe their most recent attempt at
a killer robots and as you can see it's
already mid-transition and cloning and
taking over human bodies that one right
there Chloe's a master of disguise has a
lifelike visual animations for the eyes
and everything can dress up like a
butler to seem innocuous and fool you so
that they can obviously build an entire
army of themselves to take over the
human race I do not trust these robots
at all I think they're very deceptive so
guys if you're being attacked by Chloe
remember that they have very slow
movement speed so run away and also
there are no arms so use that to your
advantage
that's a game
this is the UB Tech dream with robots
booth they have a couple robots on
display here this is the Walker Walker I
think because it has fully autonomous
capability to walk around walked close
up to you and then obviously unleash a
lethal attack of some variety there this
one obviously has hit its preset kill
limit killbots always have to kill limit
that's why you're in a tough spot you
can just throw a wave a wave of your own
men after them until they reach that
limit and shut down he's coming right
for us back away back away slowly
so it looks it looks
got all the people standing around
watching and thrilled completely
oblivious to the danger in front of them
okay oh it's it's firing up its main
weapon its firing up its main oh no it's
just dabbing it's just dabbing it's okay
it did a little dab they're much more
nefarious those would be the alpha mini
right over here they've shrunk down they
Walker into a portable petite size it
looks so cute dances around but if you
guys haven't watched Jurassic Park you
know those four camps of gannets those
are the ones that gets you those are the
ones that got John Hammonds in the
original book so these are obviously in
large groups these would be absolutely
lethal tonight could I ask you a
question
get off the robots yeah sure so how many
of these would it take to kill a man
we've located the omron booth you guys
probably know arm run because they make
switches in your mice you probably trust
them because of that and maybe you
should trust them a little bit more
because the theme of their booth is
harmony between humans and robots and
while I applaud their optimistic
position on this I'm a little bit more
cynical so behind me I think we have
what armed Iran has set up in order to
distract the potentially killer robots
because we have one robot on this side
you're doing a task taking little
tablets and putting the little thing
down and put the tablets over here and
then on the other side another robot
picks up the tablets and puts them back
in so obviously hit the robots against
each other and you have a much better
chance for survival they also got a
robot armor arm over here which is
pretty strong and powerful but Joe was
able to manipulate it and control it
with just the push of a button so we've
taking some court control over our
potential future robot overlords finally
there's a massive spider like looking
robot over in the corner which is
obviously made to create some massive
devastation currently they're using it
to play ping pong so if there's anything
more terrifying than robots that can
walk a robots that can play ping pong
it's robots stick and fly DJ has been
working on robots that can fly for quite
some time now and although they have
gained autonomous ability to think for
themselves and they're actually working
on building larger and larger drones
they do fortunately have a sort of mesh
cage like enclosure to protect the
public from the drones that they're
actually using which I've gained the
ability to recognize humans follow them
and track them around and chances are
there's probably one watching you
so when the robots come to take you away
this is what they'll strap you into so
this video is causing you concern at all
fear knots because over here we have a
police drone a police robot show this is
not controlled by a robot so in the
coming war between humans cyborgs robots
these will be used on the side of the
humans to maintain law and order and
fight the robot infestation now I know
what you guys are thinking at this point
you're not safe on land not safe in the
air next place to hide it's gonna be
underwater
unfortunately the robots have
infiltrated there as well subbu is
company behind me and they originally
developed underwater robots as well as
devices that propelled humans along
underwater there's a split in the
company robots gained sentience and now
they're obviously developing underwater
killbots those robots can go underwater
to a depth of 40 meters so subbu has
developed the SIBO which is for humans
you can hang on to it it's got our turbo
mode 45 minutes of battery life goes to
a depth of 40 meters and can go up to 14
miles per hour underwater which should
be enough to keep you away from the
underwater killer robots at least until
that battery life friends up 45 minutes
oh that should be enough time
hold on Joe
a strong
people do their laundry in the future so
they go okay
that's not good-looking
yes
run Joe it's chasing you Joe too fast
yeah alright that's good
of course not all robots here at CES are
lethal we assume that most of them are
but not all of them so behind me we have
the Robo Link booth and they have a
little tiny car it's made for kids
called zoomy it is AI controlled so if
you smile at it it'll come closer to you
if you frown it'll back away it's made
for kids and for kids to learn about AI
that little track and you can draw a
picture of a landmark like the Eiffel
Tower or something show it to the car
and then the car will run around the
track and find it so using that to teach
kids about AI and they seem pretty
innocuous I don't think I mean if there
were enough of them they might bite at
your ankles or something like that they
have a kick started going on right now
Robo linked comm /zu me so check it out
and then at the next booth which is
called verum we have a robot that's made
for dogs keep your dogs entertaining
while you're doing something else rolls
around spins around the small tricks
like little Donuts but you can attach a
little cat tail to the back hands its
app controlled remotely so you can like
be somewhere else and then tell it to
give a treat to your dog anything that
is made to make dogs a beer it can't be
bad so we give them a thumbs up - this
is the John Deere Soylent Green combine
robot sucks up the people on the right
processes them in the middle then spits
them out the back after separating them
from their useful stuff that they've
eaten in the past like corn and wheat
and that kind of thing well guys I
stroll over here by the avatar mine both
saw some more robots they all looked at
me kind of focus their gaze on me kind
of funny and not just thinking like
maybe robots aren't really that bad I
mean they seem friendly enough they have
little LED lights make them smile and
everything that seems nice so I think
I'll end this video and say forget
everything I've said about robots and
being dangerous and everything I think
as these robots behind me have reminded
me and maybe even force the thought into
my mind somehow that robots are ok so
guys don't be afraid robots are your
friends and of course thank you for
watching this video that thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it a big thank in
my sponsors for CES 2019 Coolermaster
Corsair enter max empty pool see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
