coverage from Las Vegas Nevada
look there's kaya she's hanging out I'm
being behind the camera for this time
but I of course want to start off by
thanking my sponsors for this event
gigabytes Toshiba ocz and D cool now I'm
Evy G right now so I'm gonna start off
by showing you this new case that they
have this is the D g7 it is sort of a
little brother to the BG 87 that they
came out with last year and it's sort of
a work in progress there are aiming to
launch this around the June timeframe so
right around Computex but it does have a
tempered glass side panel on one side
they have a assistant here that's fully
kitted out with an actual build in it
and then they also have an empty chassis
that we could take a closer look at and
now you have plenty of radiator support
you can actually do up to 360 on the
front on the top probably gonna be
limited to more like something like a
240 but of course this is still
development so we never know what they
might change around to that kind of
thing I really like to finish on it's
got sort of a gunmetal gray a slight bit
of texture on the paint job and then
there is a nice shroud down there at the
bottom that keeps everything enclosed
and I do like that it's got a little
EVGA logo punched out there as well I
thought that was a pretty good news
pretty good a little added bonus there
top I open standard USB 3.0 a reset
power all that good stuff
and then the front panel seems just
pretty pretty model with it pretty
standard there is like a dg7
sort of logo here on the side next to
the EVGA on the front as well as the dv7
logo that's kind of up on the top corner
near the i/o so we were kind of debating
whether or not that those like logos or
that just the model number like was it
whether it was appealing or not also the
tempered glass is fairly dark right now
and they did say that that possibly
wanted to lighten that up a bit just to
give you a bit better a look at what's
inside now the price point they're
aiming for here is about 150 US dollars
seems pretty reasonable for a high-end
case with the tempered glass side panel
they might even think about doing
something like putting tempered glass on
the opposite side
I don't know kind of on the fence about
myself of course like with all products
and development they are totally looking
for feedback from you guys so let them
know in the comments what do you think
of this case what do you think it looks
like compared to the DG 87 and any other
ideas for it
let EVGA know next up we have some z2 70
boards I have not looked at any of the
EVGA Z 270 boards but they have this
awesome new features which is that none
of them have RGB LEDs on them that's
right
no RGB LED lighting on any of these z2
70 motherboards from EVGA so maybe for
some of you guys that's really welcome
who knows
let's start at the bottom this is a z2
70 singer mini ITX they've done
everything I wanted them to do with a
new version of the stinger which is to
make everything all black just a couple
red accents on there they've included
Wi-Fi as well as a u dot 2 as well as oh
thank god and m dot 2 on the back that's
right so pretty much all those
connections that you would want and it
of course is going to support skylake
and kb like processors and i/o is pretty
decent as well
they got a USB type-c down there that is
a gen yeah 3.1 gen2 as well as plenty of
additional USB 3 and looks like a pretty
solid board overall I like the finish
next up we have 2 full size boards the Z
274 the weighted K is on the right that
one's going to cross 100 and as I'm
sorry 250 u.s. dollars so again the mini
ITX is 200 the full-size ATX for the
wind K is 250 and then the classified
which is the highest end over there on
the left is going to be 300 these have a
wide array of features of course tons of
em got to support the classified has
everything so it's got like a killer NIC
and an Intel neck as well as upgraded
audio the 70 to 74 the wind K is it just
a just slightly more cut down but I'm
still gonna give you plenty of our
clocking support not quite as beefy up
our deliveries you might notice up at
the top there just with an 8 pin and a
few less power faces but the classified
over here looks pretty beastly so if
you're looking for a really nice
overclocking board and I can pretty
confidently say just based on past
history that you're probably gonna get a
pretty good look at it out of this board
classified also features some of those
little bonus
stuff that EVGA vga does like the kind
of nicer power and reset surface-mounted
buttons their right angle 24 pin power
connector and a connected heatsink array
here between the chipset heatsink and
the erm heat sinks just to make sure you
get plenty of heat dissipation for your
overclocking needs over here we have a
wider range of products these are all
part of the QR family which I believe QR
stands for quick release and basically
EVGA has a set of products here whether
you're looking at radiators of different
sizes whether you're talking about a
single fan radiator like 120 or you want
to thick 120 or you want a 240 make sure
that I think that's 280 there or you
want a 360 or you want it to another 280
they have special EVGA fans on these
they're specially designed to reduce
turbulence as they are cooling over
those radiators especially design thin
blades as well as these sort of curves
down here that's kind of cupped cutouts
which we're told again helps reduce
turbulence and helps improve performance
so I don't know if that has been
scientifically tested or not but well
we'll take their word for it for now
now the pumps that are gonna be in these
units or well I should say all of this
all this Hardware my EVGA is working
with ace tech to put together so here's
for example a CPU block with a pump in
it that you can purchase and you buy
this kind of as its own little
individual units and then via the quick
Dannette disconnects these all come
prefilled by the way they all have the
fluid already in them and then the quick
disconnects you can just connect up like
a radiator you know and then you got a
CPU cooling loop or get yourself a qrg
hybrid graphics card that also has a
pump in it so if you're expanding the
loop for example the pumps are gonna be
in the CPU blocks and the graphics cards
and that will allow you to have enough
like fluid pressure in order to cycle
everything through the loop and they
said they haven't really had any issues
of adding stuff because every time you
have like another graphics card you get
another pump in the booth
then you just kick connected everything
up and then you have a water-cooled
graphics card and a full sort of almost
custom sort of semi custom loop that
you've arranged for yourself so that is
the QR family of products here from EVGA
lots of options here I think this is
going to be a pretty cool thing for
folks who want to get into water cooling
but maybe don't want to do a completely
custom loop and looking at may may
timeframe after the launch of the quick
release product so actually pretty soon
so keep an eye out for these it's a
retail store near you finally here is
the EVGA SC 17 this is a laptop that
they are developing right now it's
supposed to come out soon probably
around June timeframe so about the same
time as the case that we already showed
you it's a very small laptop very very
thin and svelte
and it's got a nice black finish on it
and everything lots of hardware
installed in here you got a 7700 HQ
processor we have a GTX 1060 full GPU
and Jacob has even told me that there
are some overclocking capabilities built
into this I mean of course you're
overclocking capabilities are always
slightly implemented by the thermal
envelope that you have with a laptop
form factor but that's still pretty cool
to be able to have you also might notice
that there's an RGB keyboard because
even though they didn't put RGB on their
motherboards they had to put it
somewhere otherwise they wouldn't let
them into CES the panel for this laptop
is a 15-inch of course that goes along
with the name SC 15 it's a 1080p display
but it's 120 Hertz IPs and it features
g-sync support so that's a pretty nice
package altogether I was asking about
like pricing and stuff like that for
this of course it still weighs off so
they don't know for sure but they said
they're gonna keep it competitive and
Jacob even mentioned maybe like less
than 2000 maybe even down towards 1500
but of course that's all really early to
say but cool laptop that's the SC 15
from EVGA so guys that's it for my
coverage here at the EVGA suites at CES
2017 big thanks to you guys for watching
of course hit that thumbs up button let
me know if you enjoyed this video and
I'll leave a comment down in the comment
section below for EVGA cuz again they
have quite a few products here that
they're working on but are not not yet
available and they want some feedback
from also of course a big thanks to my
sponsor spot stories gigabytes deep cool
as well as OC OC z8o Sheba company and
we'll be back soon with more coverage
from CES 2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
