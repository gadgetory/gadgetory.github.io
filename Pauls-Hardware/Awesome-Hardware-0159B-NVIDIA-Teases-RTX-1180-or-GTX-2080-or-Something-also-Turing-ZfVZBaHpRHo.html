be but I've never I haven't had cable or
any TV it's like high school
strange we'll get back to that in a
second we have the Internet ball for
right now though hello everyone and
welcome if you're watching us right now
then you're watching out some hardware
this is episode number 159 of awesome
hardware that's right it's a live show
about technology we discuss technology
we drink a few beers and have an amusing
the fun time like that's all we really
try to do we also occasionally use adult
language so this show is meant for
adults about language warning not like
all the time but you know I hope the
amount mostly um I also want to point
out that this is episode 150 159 B so
the show is split into two halves which
trim the entire thing every Tuesday
evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware but we
split the show in half on YouTube so the
first half 159 a has already been
streamed to Kyle's channel bit wins
second half's go to my channel right now
159 B if you're watching us live thanks
for being here thanks for joining us and
if you're watching in the future then
don't forget to leave feedback down in
the feedback area like thumbs ups and
comments and also tell us what the
future is like I don't know how we would
receive that information here and now
Kyle but it is a noble idea nonetheless
anyone I appreciate it okay sure
apparently this the description on
twitch still says we're on up to the 152
that's okay or so Chet is informing us
right now so guys seven if you like the
content that we produce on YouTube or
twitch or wherever and you want to help
support us then buy some merch awesome
mert Paul's Harbor net is my my website
shirts mugs Puentes all available there
go buy them except for this this gray
and black lightweight zipper you might
love that you can't get that suckers all
the other stuff you can't get though
okay no more metallic silver black
lightweight zipper who do you have it
alright it's all good it's all good
stuff we get constant positive feedback
from our merch stores you Cal stores
Bittman top tech slash store he also has
shirts thang glasses got some fidget
spinners on there there's also awesome
hardware merch on here that you'll find
from time to time such as this one
awesome harder a shirt if you buy
awesome hardware merch profits are split
between me and Kyle we appreciate your
patronage either way but you can buy
that stuff on either store and Hiro
annoyingly and hironori on that shirt
that which is cool I wanna I'm thinking
I might want to do the hero in nori
shirt you should as a normal shirt cuz I
have one there's the two of them yeah
that'd be fun it's been true Brian did
the design for these yeah he's he's
super town real good art alright he's an
artiste one quick announcement before we
get into the show proper Kyle and I are
gonna be traveling for the next two
weeks so there will not be awesome
Hardware live shows yeah sorry about
that
we'll be back three weeks from now which
will be the beginning of September sorry
to miss you guys we're doing work slash
vacation more information and that will
be provided to you guys via our Twitter
accounts and probably videos posted on
our YouTube channels too but let's get
right into the actual news hold on let's
roll then okay news let's get right into
the news after I scroll down news yes
alright so cigarette see see see graph
the graph is going on right now actually
in Vancouver quit have a cigarette stand
for again it's these super intelligent
graphics guys and grass craft people
guys and girls around a guy super
intelligent guys and girls around up
of average people pumping
super-intelligent guys and girls
Rattray okay yeah no super intelligent
guys and girls roundup of average people
hunting Thanks
why haven't we gone to this before oh I
don't know my god it sounds like an
amazing time it's not a fixed location
it moves around but right now the
cigarette is in Vancouver and from
August 12th to 14th at 12th to 16th so
it's going on for a couple more days
I bet - we'll be there humping but at
the beginning of this events Nvidia CEO
Jensen Wong Jensen unveiled some details
about the rumored next-generation GPU
architecture which is called touring
article where referencing is from PC PC
and all of these articles are linked in
the video description if you guys want
to check them out read them in more
detail so touring is actually the
successor to volta which so just to
clarify here pascal is what current
generation nvidia graphics cards based
on gtx ten series like 1080 1070 and so
on Volta has been out for a little bit
but it's only been available in like
some Quadro based cards so you can't
really get Volta architecture for like
in a gaming graphics card touring is a
follow up to that so if what is being
discussed about here is true then it
seems like maybe they have leapfrog
Volta when it comes to mainstream
graphics nerds and are going with turing
for that but it's like in totally
leapfrog to broad will yes you're right
very similar that but all we really have
from Nvidia right now is what they
talked about at SIGGRAPH which is that
Turing is a thing and it is coming out
in the form of some new Quadro RT RT x
graphics cards not GTX but RT X 5,000
6,000 at 8000 series straight Radeon
technology extreme
it's what exactly these are doing q4 of
2018 so fourth quarter of this year here
they hear the actual skews and
everything pretty impressive when it
comes to like specs and stats and
everything 16 gigs of memory on the
lowest n1 24 and 48 gigs VP you can add
to that MV link connected memory and
then they have some ray tracing specs
here but we'll come back to that in just
a minute these are so so Turing is based
on two engines they have RT cores which
is a new thing which are specific ray
tracing cores and then they have tensor
cores and these are kind of like the
engines that the power this machine of
what is touring that's separate from the
actual CUDA cores so the actual
as streaming multiprocessors are
separate from these two things so
there's a lot of questions floating
around right now about
I mean well obviously the performance of
Turing but these like the r18
ray-tracing and tensor cores and the
other steps that they're including here
what sort of strata of cards will be
available what which of these
technologies will be available at which
different steps when that comes out ends
are they gonna actually call graphics
cards RTX and not GTX anymore
but more than that in just a second
touring when it comes to the information
that in nvidia has actually come out
with is it has these arty cores which
are ray tracing cores and ray tracing
seems to be something that's are pushing
towards in the future which I'm a fan of
because ray tracing his purpose is is
traditionally not traditionally but ray
tracing is like the most effective way
of rendering an image you're taking a
light source you're tracking where the
actual beams of light from that like
each ray of light and how they were
where it's going soft how it's bouncing
off of different objects or materials
whether it's reflective or not
reflective so you're not just getting
the light source and how its lighting a
subject but how its bouncing on the ax a
genuine off with the wall and back onto
that subject and Ray Ray traced
simulations are just always the most
realistic and you you know they look
they look like real life a lot of that
time a lot of the lighting techniques
that are used when it comes to to
graphics engines and everything are kind
of faked to some extent sure so would it
be fair to say that like when you're
playing a game it's like okay you get
the graphics of the games like oh yeah
like the game that you're playing has a
certain level of graphical fidelity but
then like the game will cut to a
cutscene where the cutscene this looks
so much nicer yeah and more realistic
than the game you were just playing
would it be fair to say that that's one
of direct results of ray tracing what's
being rendered if the game you're
talking about is capable of that
of rendering then they might have used
ray tracing in a render that took you
know hours or days on a system in order
to output a scene right with that level
of detail versus the real-time rendered
scenes of like you know that yeah as
you're playing the game or something
like that it's like what I'm saying is
like that's the direction we're headed
with yes graphics like because of the
technologies like ray tracing and that's
like so the demos that they were showing
at SIGGRAPH were like oh here's this
demo you guys thought this was a
pre-rendered thing this is actually
being rendered live right now I'm
retracing in real time which I never
like oh my gosh so yeah
they're arty cores in these these
touring based GPUs can apparently are
according to Nvidia do rate calculations
at up to 10 Giga rays per second new
geekery I knew a new phrase or
measurement that I have not heard before
but Giga Ray's per second but according
to them it's 25 times the performance of
the current Pascal architecture so
that's cool
cheering also features an all-new design
for the traditional streaming multi
processor or SM GPU units and that is
what we are more traditionally familiar
with when it comes to kuduk or counts
and that kind of thing on graphics cards
changes include an integer execution
units executing in parallel with a
floating-point data path which I thought
was kind of interesting and the new
unified cache architecture with double
the bandwidth of the previous generation
so that's cool these new quad rail cars
can have up to four thousand six hundred
and eight CUDA cores for the highest-end
one the Quadro r-tx
8000 so if you combine the compute power
of the CUDA cores the RT cores the
tensor cores you get the total GPU
compute capability which is up to
sixteen teraflops again according to
Nvidia at this SIGGRAPH events and
sixteen trillion integer operations per
second which is
I'm pretty insane so again these are
quadrille cards so we're expecting these
to be more expensive they're designed
for production stuff and the type of
thing that gamers are usually less than
interested when it comes to the two
they're not a sec same two CPUs but
they're very sexy if you are doing game
development or something done they're
very if you can take if you can take
advantage of Quadro cards cards this is
a this is some pretty fun stuff and
touring the foundation of this these new
GPUs is a new architecture for graphics
cards which could very well be applied
towards other things which segues into
the next bit which is another video this
is a king or guru article but this is a
you know a teaser video that Nvidia also
played at the event and the it's called
before the game before the game which is
just kind of just like kind of like it's
not after the game it's before the game
and at first you're looking at this and
you're like wow this is just a little
kind of promotional video people
building computers and using graphics
cards and everything but no no my
friends not just a 57 second video but
rife with with hidden messages Easter
eggs and more so the video itself is
embedded in the article on cake guru but
oh what's that
Roy tag Roy Tex
RTX as the capital letters and that so
obviously there's someone named Roy in
Texas who knows who's really buff about
the Nvidia the upcoming Nvidia graphics
card these are just small clues small
clues you know peppered throughout the
video yep and we as discerning you know
end users can can watch this and perhaps
derive information from it but rather
than doing this yet ourselves
I'm gonna go and
totally co-opted Brian's so there's been
there have been rented articles on this
they've been full articles on this
videos posted on YouTube about this
because this is all stuff from like the
past 24 hours or so
sergeant ballistic no Brian are who
apparently has now also changed this
background to just all green Brian
you're drinking the kool-aid too much
but anyway so NVIDIA GeForce in this
video seems to have peppered in many
many references will Easter eggs Easter
eggs we don't we don't know for sure if
any of this is actually true but what is
he seeing here right yeah these are
coordinates these are coordinates right
here a key right a lot of t says here
here those coordinates point to Cologne
Germany which is where Gamescom is
taking place next week
sure all right all right follow that
here's some of the one screencap of some
of the texts we already saw Roy Tex
obviously what it's Texas how is Texas
involved so curious about that I didn't
know he says he says you getting on and
give me 20 give me 20 is the response so
this is something significant about 20
also the other text this is also screen
cap from the video Mack 20 is your is
having a conversation with 18 80/20
80/20 80/20 18 harassed and like r2d2 or
c-3po 2018 2018
obviously a new droid they're
referencing these are the droids right X
with another conversation with another
person not 11 not oh that seems a little
bit more specific no so yeah and then
and then apparent so Nvidia also tweeted
earlier today just this wait no this
just a big green
square called be for the game which is
using stenography which is a type to
steno graphically hide images inside the
lower bits of other images stamina
graphene systematic Ghana Ghana graphene
so you can look in that and you can find
that there's a hidden quote in the green
that says those who can imagine anything
can create the impossible by Allen
turning Allen turning Oh Turing loss
relative to Alan Turing oh that's just
the type of they know that but Brian
thank you for gathering all this quite a
few other people catch the at the very
end of that teaser
oh yeah the end of the teaser we should
we should play that yeah we're just
another where to go another clue so the
end of the teaser right at the where is
it the three fifty three seconds mark
here you might notice that's a seder of
which oh wait those numbers okay people
can't see anything right now all right
so these numbers here they're saying V
for the game cologne I mean that's a
little bit more specific than they
hidden coordinates I guess so these
numbers that pop up right here people
are looking at watch the order that they
pop in two zero eight zero that is the
order let's let's let's jump back yep
zoom in enhance two two zero eight zero
yep that's pretty straightforward yeah I
mean that's C I think that's the nail in
the coffin that's like it seems pretty
intentional and if you ask me yep so
obviously some indications of pointing
towards Cologne where SIGGRAPH except at
Masseria where where where Jamie's film
is happening next week references to the
number two zero eight zero not eleven
eleven yeah you know was there RTX
reference oh yeah the Roy Roy Tex yes
Roy Tex
all right with your would indicate or
somehow a mysterious connection with
Texas we're not sure what the Lone Star
State has to do with all of this
information here buttons
I'm sure I'll be revealed eventually as
time progresses there's nothing to be
with pollen eyes travel arrangements in
the next coming exactly oh yeah speaking
of games come we're going there for no
apparent no coincidence at all we just
happen to be but I guess Germany a
little getting into Germany thing
speaking of r-tx RTX 2080 the Turing GPU
as it is being called on this WCF tech
article apparently he has had some ashes
of the singularity benchmarks leaked out
WCF tech this is leaked information this
is obviously probably completely false
and fake and nobody should Baney any
heater attention to it but all that said
ashes of the singularity has a database
an online database and when you run the
tests if you so choose and your internet
connected you can upload the results of
your test to that database noise so a
dude on Twitter
his name is tomb APIs happy sack to UM
be sent to mapaseka must be sacked there
is there you go
way to go tomb he spotted this
information and it's picked up by w CCF
sec so they go over in the article
reasons why they think this information
is legitimate obviously we cannot
confirm or deny such information but the
profile the results were submitted under
is NV g TL test
0:09 there's another user test in the
same GPU with the name nvg TL test 0:07
so i don't know it's a sequential
testing names of the systems might
indicate some level of reliability here
the device ID as recognized in the test
results is very subtle and and
engineered for obscurity I couldn't even
see it and they screen caps they have
here but I think it's in one of the tabs
what they have under there
mmm here's a profile up there with the
nvidia envy GTL Tessio 51 FPS and crazy
settings at 5k is nuts
yes so this game family WCCO tech points
out that if you're submitting test
results to the ashes of the singularity
database it is not incredibly difficult
to fake a device ID but it is very
challenging to fake the results yeah and
the results that seem to be the
submitted are pretty impressive
including just shy of 79 frames per sec
I'm sorry this is the crazy 5k test
which came in at a 51.3 fps that's
pretty crazy and then there is the this
one which is the 4k crazy test which
came in at just shy of 79 frames per
second I believe there's a typo in the
article actually that's also a crazy the
article says 69 but I believe it's just
shy of 79 that's nuts
yeah he also seems to reference
different scores besides a little screen
caps here so I'm not completely sure of
the details but again feel free to read
the article if you guys want a little
bit more on that
even if this is true those are better
scores than what the Titan V gets but he
said and other iterations of the
sessions however the r-tx 20/80 falls
just behind the Titan V baseline
regardless if the next-gen graphics card
is performing on some equivalent level
with the Titan B that's cool yeah that's
you know for significantly less money
that way yeah well I mean hopefully if
they go by what they've done in the past
many years and they released not a TI
level not the highest end card but
something in the mid ring
we would hope it would be in the five to
six hundred dollar range yeah and we'll
see what actually comes out there but
all this talk about art TX and GTX has
been a little bit confusing so that's
that's like what I've been trying to
wrap my head around as far as the naming
what they're actually going with rumors
versus what's actually coming out are
they going to revise the GTX name or the
again as GTX now going to apply to the
lower end graphics cards and r-tx is
going to reference the higher end
graphics cards are they going to take
this new technology like the ray tracing
and the artificial intelligence stuff
that's built in Lord yeah is that gonna
be across the border is it gonna be like
something you paid for for the highest
end stuff sure it seems to me like as a
trip like so Nvidia has had like the
tank mobile cards and like the Titan V
stuff they've had these really high ends
not taken you know supposed to be not
geared towards gamers graphics cards but
they kind of ride the line between a
gaming graphics card and a workstation
graphics card so yeah if they are gonna
be calling their highest end gaming
graphics cards now RTX and they're gonna
sort of start to blur the line into that
like I'm it seems somewhat reasonable to
me
when it comes to naming of products like
this I think be very confusing a lot of
the time especially for getting into PC
gaming and you know you're just learning
it for the first time and there's so
many different names and SKUs and
numbers with letters arranged in
different ways I feel like having that
distinction might be helpful to some
degree and might also point out like oh
the art TX ones have ray tracing
capabilities right and if there are
games that now start becoming developed
because people can actually do real time
ray tracing to some degree then that
would be a distinction that would more
easily be able to tell you you can play
that game in that ray tracing mode that
looks super awesome right with this
graphics card but not with that graphics
card yeah I don't know
obviously all this stuff is fairly
information we're not sure it's probably
all lies and fake yeah but we share it
with you nonetheless here on awesome
hardware because Google's awesome hogs
it's fun it's not smarter okay a couple
more quick stories you want to go over
the twenty nine ninety WX launched just
yesterday short it available for sale
shipping to people and a bunch of
reviews went up reviews I feel like for
the threader per to stuff we're very
complimentary and positive about the
2950 X which did have some pretty
impressive games gains over the nineteen
fifty X yeah twenty nine ninety WX was
very makes a very mixed bag though
especially when you consider what you
might potentially expect from a 32 464
thread processor it's capable of right
and a lot of people who were testing
with Windows saw minimal gains depending
what they were testing in Windows 10
like there was a lot of law of
diminishing returns there yes so this
article again linked in the description
is the per onyx review of the twenty
nine ninety WX and it's comparing it
specifically using various software a
lot of it which I'm not familiar with so
I can't speak on these but it's testing
the software and if under different
operating system canary O's so Windows
10 clear Linux 24 200 bhutesu and tear
goes 18.7 and opens open SUSE SUSE an
Zeus alright get Zeus Zeus probably
showing different scores and so like
here you should Windows 10 obviously the
performance is a lot less than the other
operating systems here again more is
better so Windows 10 worst performance
comparatively frames per second more is
better Windows 10 performing worse so
the concept here and this has actually
also been confirmed by Microsoft
believe via Twitter and they've said
something publicly saying like hey this
$29.99 TWX and Windows 10 is not
performing how it should be right
there's a lot more untapped performance
that is being held back perhaps by
operating system low level stuff that
they could maybe fix with patches and
whatnot so they will again articles
linked in the description if you guys
want to check it out pretty drastic yeah
I mean some of these are really really
drastic and and a lot of the benchmarks
reflected this they were like they were
like the 1950 X from last year did
better than the 2990 WX Lucas you know
on paper is supposed to be so much more
at that supposed to have so much more
performance so kind of similar to when
risin lunch last year and they had to
have a special power profile for your
stuff you know the software oftentimes
needs to catch up right and when you
have such a massive jump in core counts
with CPU compute capabilities you know
then it's bound to run into some some
problems
Windows 10 being the underlying problem
is going to affect a lot of different
things so I guess give it some more time
yeah and maybe if you were kind of
disappointed by me 9 any W X numbers at
launch perhaps with some patches and
stuff we might see some of this
performance of proof so cool is it was
nice but it's more of a software issue
because that seems to be a bit more
feasible to fix to roll out diameter
pilots I would love to I would love to
see a direct response from Adobe in some
way because the Adobe Premiere rendering
is not usually not like is so not good
yeah what's comparison so I'd love to
see Adobe come out be like hey we saw
these new processors come out and people
are excited about them for using them
for our stuff so we worked with AMD to
leverage will make it work better
Oh Dobie do that yeah that'd be awesome
yeah one last story here to talk about
this is from Eurogamer but it's actually
about a Microsoft studio a new Microsoft
studio called the initiative and not a
whole lot of details here but just
something that maybe it is something to
keep an eye on for the opening studio
yes new Microsoft game developing studio
ok
and you could look at this from two ways
you could look at it from like oh it's
Microsoft and and they suck it's big
software company and no reason to get
excited or you could look at it from the
point of like it's Microsoft and they
made halo piece one of like the most
popular games of all time or at least
festivities like halo well yeah but I
mean Microsoft is just giving money cuz
in collaboration you're right there but
Microsoft has done some good stuff at
the gaming studios and if there is a new
cool good gaming studio in the works and
potentially creating cool games as a
results then maybe it's something keep
an eye on so that ahead of the studio
which is called the initiative is
Darrell Gallagher and he actually did a
post on LinkedIn I think he think that's
post on LinkedIn yeah talking about some
of the new talent that they had acquired
they since he took down the post
afterwards so I don't know if there's
any any skullduggery going on here or
whatever there's a reason they were
maybe this is an early announcement but
nonetheless that screen that post was
screencaps so we know what he said
they've hired a bunch of high-profile
people from high-profile studios
including Sony there's Sony's exclusive
Santa Monica studio and also Rockstar
and crystal dynamics so god of War's
lead producer Brian Westergaard
rockstars Christian and Kenta Meza
Daniel Neuberger from Crystal Dynamics
Microsoft senior senior director of
portfolio planning Blake Fisher any lor
who is an experienced recruiter who's
worked at riot respawn at EA also during
she's also drank with the ex Crystal
Dynamics Lindsey mcweenie who will be
the initiatives new HR and culture
manager so the article seam is fairly
positive about a lot of these hires good
talent from locations that have proven
themselves in the past so I guess maybe
keep an eye on the new micro stuffs
Microsoft studio the initiative
and maybe they'll be cool games coming
up hmm I'm down yeah all right let's
move up a sword fight all right what we
arguing today sir fights where can i
argue about stuff sounds good i can
always go for a good argument we shake
for it and we argue about nevermind it's
a super controversial topics usually
super controversial topics today we're
keeping it relatively simple because
we've talked a lot about the upcoming
and video stuff
GPUs mostly and we have used different
names at different times as we've
referred to them and now today we have
new information but we're still a half
percent sure it's still rumor
speculation so what do you guys think I
was just kind of curious about this if
you guys have been following along with
the potential upcoming names for Nvidia
graphics cards you can choose more than
one response here excuse me so I want to
know 1180 versus 2080 okay and GTX
versus RDX I see what's gonna win here
okay
combine the two winners together and you
have the name right of what in videos
new graphics card should be called short
alright okay I'm gonna say 2080 makes
sense because it's one fewer syllable
than 1180-1186
they'll add that will add up they will
probably save me like a full hour of my
life it's like the few pennies that you
shave off of the manufacturing process
for something that you know
they make a million units up or
something yeah right it's millions of
dollars right there so break those
triples now that makes it makes a huge
difference
2080 for sure and I'll play devil's
advocate here and say GTX all the way
because GTX is what I know it's what I'm
familiar with and how dare they change
anything so drastic that really matters
not at all to me I am a person on the
internet and I am fickle and I hate
change and even though it doesn't matter
what it's called I'm still pissed and
disgruntled and I can't believe I take
personal offense
this name change should be geez yes GTX
for life
see GTX 2080 would be my ideal name for
the next-gen graphics up from video so
obviously Kyle is wrong and the correct
answer here if you guys are following
along at home is RT X 1180 though it's
obvious it's straightforward but start
with the number the number first before
we talk about the letters the number
1180 historically this is this is all
based on history and obviously history
and we don't learn from history we are
doomed to repeat it if you look
historically at Nvidia's naming
conventions over the years they have
never made a jump from 10 to 20 they've
never made a 10 a jump by a factor of 10
has just never happened before yes we've
had jumps by factors of over a thousands
for instance when they regrets from the
9000 series down to the 200 series but
that was a sea change you know they're
obviously there was a lot of other
factors at the time going into that
point is Nvidia is a
their company that is established with
the long track record of stability and
regular progress and you know jumps to
the we've had jumps
we've had jumps in the to did digit
range for a while 200 series jumps to
400 series there was no 300 series we
had a 500 series we had a 600 series we
had seven or series there was no 800
series but we haven't even we have a 900
series I believe there was actually an
agent in series and more laptops but
I've never write about that point is
jumps of one or two digits is what in
video usually goes for a chump from 1000
it's why it's so ridiculous it's just it
makes me technically to jump from 1 to 2
stupid no obviously the 80 is separate
it's a jump from 10 to 20 1080 reach 10
to 11
1080 to 1180 is more of a change than
1080 to 28 how can you possibly even
back that with any sort of like logic
because it's the Internet and they'll
decide with whoever sounds the most
confident and they will look into the
facts just whatever whatever people feel
whatever people feel is right just go
with your family just go with your gut
all right several you're already proven
why 1180 is more obvious choice compared
to 2080 dumb now r-tx as we were talking
about on Cal's half of the show NVIDIA
has had reference design models for
quite some time that I've got a little
tired a little stale so how does GTX so
they need to upgrade it RTX makes sense
it's the obvious successor to GTX g2 are
goes hand-in-hand no I rest my case
anyone knows that buying a GTX 28 feels
way better than buying an r/t x28 come
on let's be honest people GTX is right
now because the r-tx 2080 doesn't exist
no is only the r-tx 1180 it's all an
illusion all right the only exists in
your mind let's see what you guys think
I'm right
check the results 2080 way and GTX GTX
21 I win both double look at it look how
close it is though it's very it's very
split all losers obviously this is the
result of you going first loser people
placing your boats there after they
heard you and then as I was talking you
know if you give it more time for people
to hear what oh yeah I'm sure that's
definitely this is gonna happen
never mind the 2080 just increased right
now a little bit never mind that at all
sorry max 1180 will win they just got to
give it gtx 28 for life with them right
that wins yep and forced to take a drink
of my beer damn right
Marco God fanboy how will I survive this
cruel punishing you a little of an AV
Club all right I think that's all I have
to talk about know we have Milton it's
Bob Melvin male Time Lord okay all right
I'm just gonna start unboxing
Beijing stuff because there's visualize
so much there's a lot of things
wait this is from this is from oh this
is like an Amazon purchase oh cool when
you guys send me stuff directly from
Amazon I don't know the same thing who
sends in there you get this this this
didn't they send me one of these too
yeah I think they send this to both of
us probably Oh
fans okay they're easy DIY fans do you
know why RGB fans yay thank you I will
find something to do with these I'm sure
so guys if you're not familiar with
mailtime Kyle and I both have pio boxes
and if you want to send us anything as
long as it's not like poisonous
dangerous or illegal go ahead and do
that through my PA boxes peel box for
three to five Diamond Bar California 9 1
7 6 5 a - 1449 la mirada something
houses p.o box
14:49 La Mirada California nine zero six
three seven nine zero six two seven nine
zero six two so good it's also in the
description of my videos so cal also
hasn't checked this box in a while which
is why he has many things - I have a lot
of things this is also from Amazon it is
a it's a what does this say it's a it's
a Kyle thing oh that's just a mattress
my shirt it's a Kyle thing you wouldn't
understand my shirt you just wouldn't
understand now everyone who sees me
wearing this place will know my name is
and that they wouldn't understand what
they wouldn't understand I don't know
but it's Kyle thing so it doesn't matter
you don't you got one - yeah of course
does your say it's a I'm awesome or
something like that
Oh what's it from the same person I'm
guessing so they're very similar but I
don't know where mine I thought it was
back there but I don't know well cool
sure it's on okay
Oh weird
we're credibly and fondly this is
something as an article or no a letter
from Edwin and mr. Edwin thank you so
much I won't read this to you or I won't
read this out loud on stream because you
probably don't want me to but thank you
very much for writing this says that
your it looks like you're looking for
some advice in your first PC and your
huge witcher 3 fan assassin's creed
Assassin's Creed fan and you want to get
into games like wow don't do it
don't get into wow it will destroy your
life he's also like to get into YouTube
and streaming yeah that's fun when they
came up with so far
cool well thank you ok oh you've gotten
so a list of specs here it's a micro ATX
bill gigabyte a d50 md v 3h that's a
motherboard a sama max cool white I've
never heard of that case a risin 320 200
G and a and a gigabyte rx 588 gigabyte I
don't know if I would go to a to you it
would I'd probably go with like a
Verizon 5 at least if you could save up
for a risin five six core that would be
pretty sweet I think that would serves
you well it's also possible given how
long it has been since you oh he's got a
video card in there he does a video
which is why I don't think he should go
to a Pew she's probably up for more
cores of yeah yeah so bill with horizon
5 6 core CPU with 12 threads I think
that would do justice for your rx 580
everything else seems pretty good though
16 gigs of DDR for 3,000 decent systemic
power supply B through 15 motherboard
gigabyte
yeah looks good just uh just up here
your CPU to rise in five you're good to
go
thanks Edwin I'll read the rest of this
later but I appreciate you writing it
Thank You Evan alright this was sent
from Seth H from Omaha and the breasts
yeah what it says Wow this computer
parts whoa
you got memory and in an SSD dude
several pages of kids is documentation
damn you got a 16 gig kit of LTX that's
pretty nice
wait and there's a USB USB stick in here
and we don't trust the USB sticks yeah
plug this into your this is deer pull
hardware and bit with he included what
is a standard or a stamp for return
address kind of sketchy send you all
several things the ddr4 2400 16 gig
that's 2400 kit yep corsair RAM and one
formatted new but won't fit build list
hundred 20 gig SSD what case design an
e-waste program item that I would like
Harold's help with along the side help
get it set up and his help getting
schools across the nation and major
companies to listen
all that I'm trying to I'm trying to
gather what he's but the goal is here
from Seth why do I have a paypal credit
letter I don't know
address to your address my address
that's your address although there's my
appeal bar he's detected that well yeah
but why how does PayPal how did they get
a hold of this doesn't make sense
hey pally Mila stop tracking me with
Google location history wait we
have we have something else here so what
else is he our are the parts just
because he had extras and he just felt
like you needed them when I know for a
fact you don't what's going on like what
does he want
does he want your soul I would have sent
ya there's a small box here this is from
I would have sent thunder you're all
channeled but the roommate shirt changed
me on his part of the rent money again
what a dick
this is from Quadra clicks Quadra clicks
in Alta Loma California
Quadra clicks sent me a mouse what are
beefy right above touch Quadra clicks
gaming LLC what is that this is the
weirdest looking Mouse I've ever seen
that's ridiculous
what the hell is happening why why does
it look like that okay I'm doing it test
right now I'm gonna play I'm not playing
in yeah that's my computer using your do
not plug that in Oh weird but the
buttons are not up here they activate
back here what why they only work here
up here they do not work they do not
click up here who does anyone use a
mouse like this yeah it's the fingertip
the Fang grip Fang grip Mangrum cuz your
fangs are read okay this is the weirdest
Mouse I've ever seen and I don't
understand it but I appreciate the gift
and thought that went behind it I'm sure
there's also a switch underneath it what
is this a mouse for ants okay I don't
understand this mouse stack it's gonna
castle punished
Oh what carpal tunnel mouse throat okay
I don't I don't get it I don't get it
but thank you thank you anyway
what just when I thought I had seen it
all
I hadn't fun slowly and slowly
comprehending what I got nutrition facts
so screw you oh good that's even more
confusing one serving size 140 rings per
container there's literally a lot of
fiber a dietary fiber everything is 0%
fine like cholesterol sodium trans fat
but dietary fiber is fifteen thousand
three hundred and sixty eight grams
that's a lot of fiber that's actually
fifty four thousand eight hundred and
eighty six percent of my daily fiber
zero protein though so I probably won't
eat it you probably eat the cardboard I
know I need some protein and fiber
anyway yo you might be asking what the
 is this piece of cardboard well he
said to you because we think you're hot
and successful school and because you're
so hot we let we'd let you in on the
next trendy diet to share with your
followers it's called the cardboard diet
that's right and it's about to change
your life after trying countless diet
foods that look good on the box we
finally just committed and ate the box I
mean if you're gonna eat food that
tastes like anyway you might as
well be eating cardboard am i right
cardboard is naturally gluten-free
dairy-free paleo and vegan cardboard
doesn't pretend to be someone that it's
not so what are you waiting for that
beach bod is only three malnourished
months away and closes your free sample
more free samples are available at your
local grocery store in the storage area
at your local u-haul who are we take the
red pill and find out
yo cardboard DICOM fine print
take off nutritional label before
consuming nutrition label is not edible
and neither is cardboard eating straight
cardboard is stupid this has
been the greatest gift that I've ever
received and I'm still playing these
cardboard His Majesty bit with it was
addressed to his majesty bit with you so
surprised that I can always appreciate a
good mean gift thank you very much sir I
so just I need to come back to this
sentence shipment because it's multiple
things set I think you were perhaps
figuring that we're capable of doing a
few more things than we're actually
actually capable of I barely have enough
time to like talk to my parents on a
week you know I kind of weekly basis so
so keep that in mind that said these two
things that he sent us the memory kit
and the SSD he wanted us to include and
a charity giveaway okay a charity
donation or Apple PC build-off for our
entire area okay no offense meant to set
but that is a significant amount of work
to coordinate that type of event maybe
we could donate to this to the gaming
one team that's a good idea
we're already late on that and the SSD
oh maybe we're late but we can stop so
we we do we do try to work out giveaways
charity stuff every so often but it is a
decent amount of work especially if
you're talking about raffling something
or selling something second up he these
are all designs he sent designs for a
case okay designs birthday the actual
loop like actual what layouts what of a
case will steal his idea the different
size millions sizes and everything
like that which I think he wants us to
give their power somebody so that we
can't they can share it was another case
builder he has a first viewer sponsored
case but if we do get this kids produce
we should name it after his four-legged
kid okay his dog Lucy fur baby so big
shout outs a little wolf fur baby um
alright so Seth thank you so much for
sending us nothing I am absolutely not
sure or confident that we could promise
you that we'll follow up on the stuff
that you've asked us to do simply
because there's a lot of time involved
but we do sure I know I and I think Kyle
does as well trying to keep sort of a
stash of stuff that we save for
giveaways and everything like that yeah
and we have done several events like
that in the past and we will definitely
add this to that and hopefully in the
future we can Arctic scent use done I
don't know if this is from Arctic
directly from Arctic from Arctic cooling
yes is directly from Arctic Wow
interesting
oh they sent me a box of stuff recently
too did they really yeah to your P o box
wasn't to the P o box cuz I had actually
talked to them directly
okay I've never spoken as far as I know
to anyone nice other no Computex I did
talk to someone from Arctic at Computex
like in passing like while I was from
one booth to another it was like a two
minute thing so in a similar fashion I
don't know how they tracked down my
shipping address but for you apparently
they shoulda checked on your PU box
which isn't hard because my PE box is in
the description of all my videos but we
have like one two three four five six
arctic Bionics f1 20s and this is an
entirely normal based no nothing paid to
me or anything like that this is a
really good throw place so Arctic yeah
yeah I've used Arctic for years
is there MX for stuff I've used this
before I you want something gave me like
30 of them No
got a big pile to know you got some
chance there's literally like 30 of them
in here so keep these on have so many
funniest available and this is not
cheap thermal paste is very expensive
considering how much you get inside
of one little plunger Thank You Arctic I
appreciate it
I just gave a very very good review of
your Arctic eSports one tr4 cooler that
should have you know did that do well it
did surprisingly well yes yeah
alright this is from Michigan that's
just an address I don't have a name
Michigan is this a peachy keen humble up
here I feel like this is maybe or
something no it's so soon a piece of
paper
yeah okay hotel this feels like it might
consume liquid oh really
maybe beer we have to gotten sent beer
at some point it's not super sure wait a
minute all right look piece of paper
alright
hello pollen cow greetings for my fan in
Michigan being from Michigan I thought
it would be sporting of me to send you

the others enjoy so much Randall laughs
thank you so much Randall why does some
packaging the chairman key dad's recipes
headphone you this waiting six pack you
get a six pack up stuff
I got a CPU cooler hey mujin midget
sighs it's a new game design Mugen -
really - where is it
I've never used this one it's gone all
that's cool why are they send me a
course I'm not sure is it because they
wanted you to appreciate seasons so hot
design of it and everything if we go
thank you thank you whoever sent this
this is a six pack of bells - heard a
tale from Randall

Gus are from Missouri thank you so much
guess so curious oh wait there's a
message in here the size offs of
hardware there aren't too many occasions
when beer and computers come together
when I spotted the brew situated at the
top of this package I instantly thought
of you guys
it has ties to the custom PC world well
sort of you might even say it's dynamic
I've included two bottles of this
special brew plus four more two other
Brewers each for you guys to drink on
the show thank you for making great
content my builds would be lost without
you both sorry for the extensive
packaging presser Chicago cheers guests
from Kansas City that's from Kansas City
Wow guys thank you oh my God thank you
for the good packaging to weave we have
had a few brews sent to us that were
unfortunately damaged on arrival but
these are totally in good shape and
they're all individually wrapped we have
six of them I'm guessing they're all the
same beer so let me just let me just
open one of these up so we can get a
closer look
good job guests each of these has its
own zip block I want to reuse all these
all these citizen boxes a large large
ziploc bag sir
there we go and they again this is

thanks Gus it's only set now for the
next couple weeks I think at least well
we'll probably be drinking these when we
get back so yeah early September
we'll come back to that in the meantime
though let us drown out my half of the
show wouldn't leave donation comments oh
yeah thanks so I guess who have sent in
some donations give them of the monies
studying with bazinga ex-ceo $20 thank
you man hey hey Paul how about the HTTP
see it's been like 10 years Oh hasn't
been 10 years hyper laser I have plans
for the HTTP see Jerry do you know I
move I move at a slow but the consistent
steady pace consistently slow and and
that's that's really what it comes down
to for me but yeah I know I do i do
intense like that like i've i've done
this many times before i've i've let
stuff sit for like well over a year
1 2 3 years even sometimes but I come
back to it I come back to it he do he
follow through
I bet true in my own time my own pace I
think actually what I want to do with
the HTPC although I did have some
recommendations for
from people for how to possibly get rid
of the wood beetles that appear to still
be nesting in there
is to take it back to the place that I
originally got it but also want to get a
little bit more wood there to make
shelves out of so I could have that as a
wall mount and also make shelves along
with it for a few of the other people
things that need shelves be cool so yeah
next time and hopefully in due time I'll
come back to that make dudes five dollar
donation no comment thank you Mike
dudes much much obliged thanks thanks
for that MB 67 mr. lenticular $13.13
three dollars and 37 cents the leap
donation says Cheers thank you hey shoes
way back at you how's that took after
Jekyll Stephen Hill $10 donation Stephen
he said leaving it leaving for Austin as
a 5 a.m. tomorrow if you guys ever head
out that way let me know cool did a
slower product cycle in the GPU and
force you to to get more creative in
making content take it easy I would say
for myself personally at least in the
past I don't know in the past year
beginning that maybe not so much the
beginning of this year but in the past
year I feel like I've always had stuff
to do like and I've tried to gear my
content less towards like trained to
have like a thorough coverage of the
tech world and more being like just what
I want to cover yeah and I always have
stuff to do so if there's new launches
or products coming up I have content to
produce on that if not I have a lot of
stuff around here in my house that I've
been working on and I'm trying to sort
of make content based around that as
well yeah and so I've always got stuff
to do I agree I think it's all about
perspective I don't think that you know
the fact that there hasn't been a new
GPU launch in years
has really restricted me or or forced me
to to be more creative but rather has
allowed me to be more creative because
with like a conventional graphics card
or CPU review there's really not a whole
lot you can do to be super creative with
how you deliver that information at the
end of the day it's about the data and
the results and comparisons to other
other hardware but when you're not just
constantly trying to chase every big
watch every big silicon launch that's
you know that's popping up it it lets
you it gives you room for for other
content that maybe you've been waiting
to do for for a long time that you just
haven't had the ability to or the
opportunity to so I think if anything
it's it's allowed us to be more creative
as opposed as opposed to that being
something that's forced upon us it's
it's it's nice we enjoy when it's not
just a constant barrage of launch after
launch after launch because there there
are creative projects that we we think
about and that we have in the chamber
that we want to deliver to you guys and
that allows us to do that and look I
look forward to the long periods of time
with nothing scheduled yeah that's yeah
that's the best yep
think of this even Michael's secrets $20
donation I'm looking at GPUs for a
gaming build is a gtx 1066 gig a viable
card or should i spend more for the 1070
TI card so really you're talking about a
hundred two hundred and fifty dollar
difference here that's that's kind of
the gap between a 1066 gig and like the
low $400 range when the ten 70s and 1070
TI's come into play so it's it's it's
significant of my money if you look at
hundred and fifty bucks and you're like
I can handle that you know in my
month-to-month you know 150 bucks I can
absorb that as an expense then ya get
the higher end graphics card for sure if
you're on a budget if you're worried
about feeding your family or other you
know vital expenses that you need to get
by with and the
1066 gig is a perfectly viable card
especially if you're playing at 1920 by
1080 yeah you'll you'll be totally just
fine with that
you know you might not be able to max
out all the settings and all the games
but it's it's a really good card for the
money and everything so yeah it depends
on your financial situation I guess
mm-hmm but I usually say you know if you
can afford it than the higher-end card
but also that said as we've already
talked about on the show there is
potentially new cards coming up pretty
soon yeah so it might be worth hanging
up for a couple weeks to see what
happens there and see if that affects
the pricing of the existing cards at all
yeah Mustangs by Matt with a $5 donation
Paul really like your tr2 videos thank
you thank you Matt I'm building a new
HTPC win are you gonna finish yours
god it's been ten degrees so it's not
ten years it's been just over one year
just hashtag ten years just over one
year you've started a new trend yes
thank you Matt I already answered the
HTPC question from bazinga X so
hopefully you listen good of that too I
do plan to get back to it I really do
Darrell may five dollar donation
thanks for all your work I've learned a
lot thank you Darrell sweet I'm glad
we've been able to help yet if if so
bazinga X with the five more dollar
donation
thanks a lot AMD now more Windows
updates we have to go through we'll
probably be the same amount of Windows
updates honestly it'll just slip a m--
the threaded / fix in one of them yeah
every time I live like a Windows Update
an inconvenient time I want to like
tweet about it because super nice
happens at the worst times awful and
really like it can like it like the
other day I was trying to shoot a video
and my lap the laptop you're using right
now which I just wanted to like open up
and use to power my teleprompter and
it's like Windows Update congratulations
now you're gonna sit here for ya and for
10 more minutes
can't user do the thing that you wanna
do but yeah feel the pain just install
Windows 95 on this bad boy
Thank You mrs. Inga but yeah the flip
side is like oh I'm so much more
protected against viruses and exploits
right except for Microsoft you blessin
763 $5 donation wins should upgrade my
1066 gig SC GPU run an i7 7700 also just
a thought shave Kyle's head for $100 on
the next episode but sounds like a
terrible idea at this no one wants to
see me bald no one no one one I'll say I
feel like you should charge more more
money for that guy I'll do it for ya $20
well you practice that's not fair what I
have I can't like luscious locks up sell
him too much hair obviously 100 is what
he wants to spend
you're losing literally nothing you know
anything about this your Eddie yearning
bulb I'm an expert in English you bald
asshole
as for the 1066 ESC GPU I would largely
base that on the resolution that you're
playing it if you're at 1080 I would say
stick with it if you're looking at 1440
or god forbid 4k then you probably could
do with an upgrade but if you're a 10
1080 I would stick with it like for now
or at least wait until the next gen
graphics card zoom out and see again see
how that affects stuff yeah see if you
can get an idea of the launch cadence
and you know how long they're gonna wait
like if they come out with a launch and
they're like here's the new graphics
card and at 600 bucks for the art TX 20
80 or whatever they're calling it yeah
everyone's like oh I'm super excited
about that for now how long after that
until they launch the $250 variants
because the $250 variant is that's that
that's the mass production variant
that's that's what most people are gonna
buy spend that amount of money on and
that's often like where you kind of get
the the best balance of price to
performance so
it's kind of worth sticking around for
that but that's what you have right now
is a 1066 gig which is so which is that
card so why upgrade until you have a
replacement for that guy true I guess
you can upgrade to the 400 R version and
Thank You Blair sin 7-6 is a great
matter grey matter 9 9999 no no comments
thank you grandma thanks Greg appreciate
your donation and the fact that you are
very smart
finally bazinga X $5 deal one hundred
and twenty dollars to shave Cal's head
no we didn't agree on $120 play it I
would I would accept 300 bet to a 10,000
we're totally gonna remember that
promise visiting X in the next awesome
hardware which is like three weeks from
now good luck no way we're gonna forget
it
yep in the meantime though if you guys
are watching live we are ending our show
so we know you're disappointed but we
want to at least give you somewhere else
to go where you can cry and commiserate
with everyone else about how sad you are
that I live show is over
yep if you want to do that good stop TV
slash spanks that's SP j and k KS
