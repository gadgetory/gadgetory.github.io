sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill fen techs guys fantex actually
has some very new and compelling and
interesting new products I'm going to
start off with this one right here and
make my way to the most interesting
thing but stay tuned for that this is
the n2 primo DS it's a dual system case
right now they kind of threw it together
system in here really quick it's using
some non rigid tubing liquid cooling
they've got their new fantex water block
on their GT X 1080 and they're more on
that in just a second but this is a mini
ITX and full sized ATX board case fits
all those and it also has RGB lighting
now integrated as well I'll leave the
extra details to a future review guys
Luke's here now just to point that out
so GPU and CPU blocks something we
haven't seen from fantex before they're
showing us that these newly designed
ones they have a really nice finish on
them it is it's like sandblasted it's a
sandblasted finish this sort of black
that you can see right there it's also
made of copper nickel plated I'm
assuming yes of course
gianna quarter fittings as you would
also figure I mean that's pretty much
industry standard for this type of thing
interesting thing about the GPU block
though comes with RGB LEDs integrated
and fantex is of course doing a lot of
RGB LED work in their cases so you can
actually connect RGB LEDs from the block
to the case make sure that your case in
your block all match and if we know
anything about Luke it's that he will
not do a custom article build especially
with RGB LEDs unless everything matches
right yes okay very good one other thing
about these blocks is they're using not
the see this green this little green
ring right there that ring sucks that's
the old silicon ring what they're using
here is these white rings these are made
by Viton or baton or something like we
can't figure out okay if I tone it by
tone I always have your vitamins that's
terrible that was a terrible thing I
just said I'm sorry they won't even tell
us what these are made of it's like some
new space-age material or something like
that but basically it resists binding up
and pinching as you're tightening down
fittings which as we all know if you've
done water cooling is sort of and you
know you don't want that to happen you
know when I leeks while you're doing
your leak testing so very nice I'm
interested to see when these are
available what are these available June
you're gonna be able to get these very
soon especially if you got a GTX 1080
you want a water cooler right look
you're gonna water cool your GTX 980
nope okay and finally we have the n2
elites this case that's right here
behind me which is obviously massive I
think if I kind of curled up into a ball
I could probably climb inside of it but
this is you despite its size this is a
single system case right now it's
outfitted with a PPG custom water
cooling using a lot of the new fantex
fittings as well as the blocks on the
CPU as well as the GPUs so you can see
here the RGB LED lighting shining
through and if you adjust that with the
adjuster thing on the front of the case
they all change together which is
freaking awesome the other nice thing is
that you can actually route the
connector down and plug it directly into
a motherboard that has an RGB LED header
and that will allow you to use the
motherboard so if you have like one of
the ASIS or MSI or we're hearing
gigabytes gonna have motherboards
available with that functionality as
well get all that control and change all
the RGB LEDs and your system all at the
same time also you know some features
that you might expect like you know you
got some really clean removable plates
at the top it's actually popping off but
you know there's a button you push
inside there it's got is this entire
tempered glass panel it's even got a
little accent right here with a bit of
ventilation on it as far as radiator
support it will accept any radiator that
has ever been designed as far as I can
tell that's not really true it will
accept pretty much any radiator that you
might assume has ever gone into a
water-cooled system though whether
you're talking about dual fan triple fan
quad fan radiators 240 or I'm sorry 120
or 140 or any variation thereof you can
even do radiators on the bottom on the
upper part as well as on the lower part
and there's just tons of available area
down there for additional cooling and
they also come with special pieces like
this that you can pop in so a bracket
for the back right there where you can
mount SSDs or you can actually adjust
this so you can do additional radiators
not just on the top front and bottom but
also on the back side right there where
those SSDs are right now and there's
even more features I'm sure but you know
this video is getting a little bit too
long as it is watch Kyle's videos on
this as well because he probably is
going to do this right after me he's
actually working the camera it's doing a
good job thanks Kyle
not Kai your hands in the way anyway
guys I'd like to say a quick thank you
once again to my sponsors MSI fractal as
well as g.skill stay tuned for more
coverage from Computex 2016 very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
