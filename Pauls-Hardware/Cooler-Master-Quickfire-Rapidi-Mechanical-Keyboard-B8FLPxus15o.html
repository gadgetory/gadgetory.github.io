storm quickfire rapid eye from
Coolermaster and yes this keyboard
actually launched last year so why the
heck am I making another video on it
well Coolermaster has updated this
version of their ten keyless mechanical
face Smasher
with genuine Cherry MX red switches none
of those kale imposters here and I also
have a broader perspective of this
little board now that I've actually been
using the Cherry MX brown version of it
for a good nine plus months now
red brown and blue switches are all
available in the quick fire rapid eye
and my brown switch version has been my
floater keyboard around my workspace
here which means it actually gets a lot
of use and it has reliably been there
being a keyboard every time that I ask
myself where is a keyboard I need a
keyboard right now happens quite
frequently but apart from failing to
spontaneously transmogrify itself into
something other than what it is what are
the features that make this keyboard in
my humble opinion good well let's start
with build quality which I think every
mechanical keyboard deserves if you're
investing in switches that are rated for
50 million P strokes it would be a shame
to house it all in housing that fell
apart after the first few times that you
slammed your fist into it in frustration
after losing to Kyle at face off again
just picking it up though it's
substantial and it actually gives me the
impression that it could like
potentially stop a bullet if necessary
although that might void your warranty
now this is a 10 keyless board the
advantage for that is Portability and
bringing your mouse hand closer to the
keyboard on the right side for better
ergonomics you do lose the number pad
though and just FYI
the keys themselves feel delicious as
Cherry MX Reds it should and the housing
itself has a light soft rubber finish
around edges that's after nine months of
regular usage on my MX Brown model has
not worn off or done that kind of nasty
sticky gummy thing that can happen with
cheaper rubber coatings so well done
Coolermaster on that one
included in the Box is a key cat puller
I like that because this allows you to
easily pull off the key Bob the key caps
to swap them out clean the board or
simply to admire the Cherry MX red
switches beneath also there's a nicely
braided one point eight metre micro USB
cable that's included now the newer
versions have this right angle
plug and that's to address the most
frequently complained about drawback to
this board in my experience and that is
that it uses a micro USB connector on
the board side that to be fair this plug
is smaller and more delicate and it can
break if mishandled now mine is still
doing just fine even with the original
non angled plug and on the plus side it
does make that cable replaceable and you
can even get an extended cord for it if
you wanted to just keep an eye on that
connector and unplug the cable if you're
stuffing it into a backpack or taking it
on the go apart from that though the
quick-fire RapidEye has a sleek minimal
look but it also has quite a few hidden
features let's start off with n key
rollover which used to be impossible via
USB but I guess it's not anymore that
means you can press as many keys as you
want all at the same time and they will
all register it's great for finishing
that term paper off right before the
deadline lighting and functionality are
handled by an onboard 32-bit ARM
processor and profiles are saved to the
keyboard that means there's no need to
install software on your system to
control it and even if you take the
keyboard and change it over to a new
system it's still going to remember all
of your settings so you can use the
function button I've done here to
control the white LED backlighting on
each key did I mention by the way that
there's white LED backlighting on each
key coolermaster calls it active lights
I'm guessing that you realized it was
there already and as LED lighting goes I
prefer white as a neutral color because
it will blend in with a lot of desktop
setups I think anyway though the
function button with the insert home and
delete buttons grouped up here on the
top right can be used for media playback
and volume control the Print Screen
button right here and the function
button can be used to disable or enable
the Windows key which is a pretty
crucial for a gaming keyboard in my
opinion the function button and f1
through F will allow you to turn the
lighting on or off or set the LED light
lighting intensity with f2 and f3
function f4 will cycle through five
different lighting modes so you've got
all on the classic breathing mode of
course gaming mode which will light up
your WASD and arrow keys as well as to
reactive typing modes that light up each
key as you type there's one that doesn't
instant on when you each key is pressed
and the other has a fading effect which
is my favorite personally because I just
think it looks
cool I already mentioned that your
settings are saved in the keyboard and
function + f9 through f12 allows you to
save for profiles so you can light up
only the keys you want on the board to
activate this use function + the pause
record button on the top right then
choose which slot you want to use m1
through m4 then you tap the buttons that
you want to light up and then you hit
the same button and button again to save
that profile it's pretty easy once
you're shown how and I really like
there's no software and the profiles
again that you set up are safe
internally finally there's repeat rate
modes hidden in f5 through f8 + the
function button of course these are just
the repeat rate of the keys when they're
held down so it's kind of like the turbo
button on an old Nintendo controller now
before I close I wanted to address a
couple things firstly as I was
researching this video I perused the
review section at Newegg and found some
negative feedback on this keyboard
specifically regarding LEDs going out
after a period of time so I asked
Coolermaster about this and they did
confirm that worse there were some early
issues with the version with the MX
brown switches that have been addressed
in more recent manufacturing runs now I
never had a problem with my MX brown
version here all the LEDs still work but
that's anecdotal now new keyboards
should not have this problem and if you
do have an older board and you have a
failed LED or any other problem of
course you can get the board replaced as
it does come with a 2-year warranty for
service you can go to the fanzone
service center at account Coolermaster
calm secondly I wanted to mention the
competition for this motherboard
specifically RGB backlit mechanical
keyboards I think the CM Storm RapidEye
has just about all the features you
could want in this type of keyboard
apart from RGB backlighting if that's
your thing but if you want RGB lights in
a 10 keyless you're limited to the
Roseville RGB 80 right now which is
considerably less expensive than this
one but it uses kale switches instead of
actual cherry switches then you have the
corsair k 60 v RGB that is at Best Buy
exclusive and it relies on Corsairs
robust but fairly complex software suite
for lighting control I think the
RapidEye is distinct enough to stand on
its own by comparison but you're also
looking at a significant upfront
investment as this keyboard is selling
for about a hundred and thirty two
hundred and fifty dollars as of the
filming of this video that's a premium
price but you also get a very well-built
keyboard with a ton of action
reusable features and it should last a
very long time I want to know what you
think though so let me know in the
comments if you're using a mechanical
keyboard right now if it's 10 keyless or
full-sized and if you have lighting RGB
or otherwise also don't forget to hit
the like button on this video check the
description for links to my t-shirt
store as well as my Amazon affiliate
code and of course a link to this
keyboard if you're interested and as
always thanks for watching
oh yeah and the eye and rapid I stands
for illumination and intelligent and
Indig ignatius ignoble iota better okay
