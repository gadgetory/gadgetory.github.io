guys and welcome to a new pals hardware
build video that's right I'm building my
entry-level x99 build from my July
builds video and if entry-level x99
sounds like kind of an oxymoron to you
that's because it really is x99 or has
any haswell-e processors that go along
with it our Intel's highest level most
highest performing but also most
expensive processors motherboards and
the hardware that goes with it but if
you've decided that you want to go for
x99 whether you're using it for video
editing or higher-end gaming and
streaming or whether you just want to
build a beastly system how can you
actually claw your way onto that
platform without spending 2500 bucks on
the system my answer is this build right
here it's actually about $1500 that's
200 bucks down from what I actually put
it together my July builds video thanks
to the fact that I've not included a
hard drive this time and also there's
been some price drops on some of this
hardware my mo for this build is to set
everything up as an expensive Lea as
possible and if the first thing you're
thinking then is like well Paul I could
build a cheaper x99 based system than
this my secondary goal was to not really
truncate it too badly so I didn't want
to like only get a single stick of ddr4
for example or only spend a hundred
bucks on the graphics card I wanted
parts that were at least somewhat in
line with the austerity of Intel's x99
enthusiast platform so that's how we
ended up with the build you see here I'm
going to assemble it for you right now
but first let's take a look at each
individual parts and a quick sentence or
two about why I chose it the core of any
build is going to be the CPU the
motherboard and the memory in my
personal opinion and if you're on x99
and you want to get in cheap well the
5820k is going to be your best bet for
entry-level it's the most expensive even
though it's around $400
but it still has six cores 28 PCI
Express Lanes
and a host of other really cool features
it's a beastly CPU and it will even
outpace the new skylake processors
especially if you're using
multi-threaded applications skylake
processors can be just to touch faster
in certain areas but for the most part
you're still going to be faster with
5820k now I also need a cooler wait
where'd the cooler go oh it's over here
the 5820k and all the other enthusiasts
high-level processors don't ship with
CPU coolers so I didn't want to spend a
hundred bucks on a closed-loop cooler or
something like that but I also didn't
want to spend 20 or 30 bucks on
something that didn't look very nice so
that's my in-between the enter maxi TST
40 really nice cooler I've used it
before it looks nice and it performs
well so I'm I'm happy with that choice
back to the motherboard that's the x99s
sli this is already dropped in price I
think it's about 215 or 220 dollars
right now very full-featured motherboard
for x99 it's got everything you'd want
including eight DIMM slots so that's why
I chose that finally for the trifecta of
beginning parts we have the memory if
you click link in the description to
check out the build on PC part picker I
believe I'm using the reptiles for these
are the rs5 they're the new ones from
g.skill so I'm just using these as a
stand in a little bit more expensive so
go for the cheaper ones if price is a
concern but I do recommend getting a 4x4
kit at minimum because that will allow
you to set up for quad-channel
you can't get by with two I'll say that
at least get to them get a good dual
Channel at least for the video card we
have the MSI r9 390x gaming 8g this
one's a little over $400 about 430 bucks
the GTX 970 would also be a great option
here if you want to spend about a
hundred bucks less and make this one
even cheaper this one just seemed like a
good fit because you got eight gigs of
gddr5 memory you can use this for video
editing acceleration and that kind of
good stuff so that's why I kind of felt
it was a good choice there's a ton of
other GPUs of course you could drop in
here so let me know in the comments what
you think you would add storages next
this is the 850 Pro I I know I have a 50
Evo and the actual build on PC part
picker this is a standin because I don't
have an 850 Evo 500 gig this is the 500
Ryo 512 K persian of a 50 pro this one a
little bit faster but also cost more so
yeah again if you're going for the
budget option get the 850 Evo this one's
this one's beastly fast though so that's
why I'm using it and finally for power
delivery we have the thermal take deep
ESG 750 watt this is also a stand-in as
compared to the one I have
the actual build on PC part picker
because this is the one I have on hand
to build with that one is still 80 plus
gold and 750 watts though so it's still
equivalent though this one just has a
few more features like full modularity
and everything and actually I also think
hopefully it might tie everything
together because it's got little bit of
red like the graphics card a little bit
of like goldish yellow it could be
motherboard who knows this this build
actually might not turn out to be the
most aesthetically pleasing but hey
we're going for performance here right
yeah performance and the case I'll be
using is the enthu pro from fantex and
I'm excited to build in this case
because I've heard many positive things
about it but I haven't actually built in
it myself so I'm looking forward to it
and this has plenty of room to fit
everything that should be an easy
building experience and it's also got
plenty of upgrade space for the future
so don't let the plain box fool you
there's a beastly case hiding inside
there's a look at all dem parts though
again the link is in the description if
you guys want to check this out on PC
part picker and has all the pricing and
where you can buy them and everything
and other than that why don't I go ahead
and hit the turbo button get this thing
put together
alright guys there it is it's all put
together and I gotta say first thought
is it came together better than I was
expecting I was kind of expecting this
to be a little bit more of a mishmash of
parts as far as the colors go and stuff
but it actually it blends decently well
although there's definitely improvements
that can be made so remembering that my
goal here is to build a entry level
haswell-e system at x99 for as little
money as possible and you can get this
for pretty cheap say fifteen hundred
bucks maybe even fourteen hundred or
thirteen hundred if you were to do a
couple things like maybe swap that SSD
out for a 256 gig or maybe go for a gtx
970 or and r9 390 or maybe even like in
or get a secondhand r9 290x or 290 those
are all decent options in there but I'd
say at 390 maybe 390x I go at that over
at 290 or 290x just for the video memory
if you're planning using this as a
workstation at all anyway I got to say
working with the fantex in through pro
case for the first time was pretty
fantastic as well I'm going to start
with my single gripe about the case
which is that the the thickness of some
of the side panels and the build quality
is not quite as up to standards as some
of the other things but if you can live
with that everything else in this case
is absolutely fantastic in the feature
list is just awesome so you can kind of
tell here like this I would put a little
bit of I put a damper on there or
something because it's not not closing
quite as well as it should let me get
that side panel off there real quick and
I'll show you the interior ok so there
she is
we have a power supply cover down at the
bottom so we can't see our thermal take
some 150 watt power supply but that's
okay I think that actually looks decent
without it now there's a bit of red and
a bit of gold in this build and I think
since those are the only main colors it
kind of blends in ok I will say could do
with some LED maybe lighting on the
interior here or something but again the
idea here was to kind of get off the
ground so little bells and whistles like
that I wanted to leave out and leave up
to you the white fan actually doesn't
blend in as well as it should neither so
does the one on the front of the case so
those I don't know I might swap out in
the future or something
swap out a scythe gentle typhoon fan
instead of the one that comes with the
enter max here because that has a blue
LED and that would have made it
everything even more mishmash
so that's gray so I don't know black
fans might might blend in a little bit
better I would also maybe turn off the
track lighting on the Gigabyte x99s sli
motherboard because it's a lot a lot
more yellow and it doesn't it adds
another cone there that doesn't really
match the white on the MSI I don't mind
too much but anyway that's all talking
about aesthetic stuff though what this
is really going to do is it's going to
perform like an absolute beast since
you've got the six core processor in
there and you've got 16 gigs of memory
and you've got a really decent graphics
card for gaming or for what you should
really be using this for if you're going
for an x 99 build content creation or
just higher level stuff you know you got
to be doing AutoCAD or something that
really crunches numbers to get the most
out of that CPU that is all for this
video though guys so I really hope you
have enjoyed it don't forget I've got
one more build coming up really soon as
well as some PAX Prime stuff so don't
forget to hit the subscribe button on my
channel if you want to stay tuned for
those don't forget to like this video
too if you enjoyed it and you want to
see more videos like this kind of see me
do more of my monthly builds and
actually put them together that would be
fantastic
anyway guys thanks again for watching
and we'll see you in the next video
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
