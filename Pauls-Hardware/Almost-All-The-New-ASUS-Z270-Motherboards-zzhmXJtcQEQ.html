Paul's hardware it is a brand new launch
of a new series of both CPUs as well as
motherboards from Intel well the CPUs
are from Intel the motherboards from our
Intel's partners such as Asus and as
I've been doing kind of a tradition now
I've been bringing JJ over to take a
look at as many of their new
motherboards as we can so that's what
we're doing today we have a wide range
of a suzi 270 motherboards here they all
support the new KB Lake processors that
should be out now we're out very soon
from Intel and they've all got z2 some
of these chip chipsets and there's
actually four different product lines so
let's start out with that JJ what are
the four different product lines in
which segments of the market are they
sort of aimed at so first up we're going
to have the traditional series that kind
of we've been I think most known for so
this is historically covered boards like
that deluxe the pro are the - a which
has been really popular and these are
all now designated underneath what we
call our prime series of motherboards
that easiest way that you'll probably be
able to see them is that they're going
to be the board that are essentially
white so if you see essentia board
that's got that kind of bum black PCB
and then that white design aesthetic
that's going to be that series and in
terms of generally who we're trying to
target I would say that the prime series
is really kind of the foundation from
Asus you're getting you know
best-in-class design so you're going to
get improvements in pretty much every
key category that you would want whether
it's audio networking fan controllers
UEFI all that really great stuff build
qualities can be elevated but it's
really kind of designed for really
anybody whether you're a gamer whether
you're looking to be able to build a
hybrid system so content creation
advanced productivity maybe a little bit
mixing of all of those things it's going
to make a really great foundation for
all of them cool next up we have the
Tough Series I've been a longtime fan of
the Tough Series are there any changes
to this is this kind of maintaining
where it's been pretty much it's going
to be pretty close to it probably the
biggest change is that people when
they're looking for the board they might
be thinking that they're going to put
like saber-tooth historically the board
zombies that we've generally messaged
because we did have some variance in the
such as like the griffon um there's no
more Sabretooth so everything falls
under the tuff so it's going to be the
tough 270 and there's going to be a mark
1 and then there's going to be a mark 2
and that's just gonna be like previous
generations and we'll go into some of
those differences in general but yeah
both of them here in terms of kind of
your target demographic really first and
foremost I would say this is really for
advanced productivity for content
creation enthusiasts for prosumers and
professionals that are looking for
validation with specialized equipment
especially stuff like Quadro cards Tesla
Xeon Phi things along those lines and
definitely I'd say any type of cooling
and water cooling enthusiast anybody
it's really interested in fans and a lot
of control and monitoring these cards
are purpose-built for them we've also
updated a little bit of some of the
overclocking functionalities so
definitely still enthusiast gamers can
find this as a foundation as well
beautiful and more on that when we cover
the boards Strix of course I was sort of
introduced as a sub brand of ROG is that
a fair assessment of that uh somewhat so
uh so so in the previous generation we
had what we called our pro gaming line
so that existed for a little berry
adduct I'm but now essentially we've
folded everything underneath the Strix
banner so Strix along with ROG pretty
much make up the dedicated gamer segment
series of motherboards have you produce
no like we said the prime and the tough
can definitely be gaming oriented boards
but when you talk about Strix rrg
they're purpose-built so everything from
the features the functionality and the
software stack that all goes in there is
going to be designed for gamers first
and foremost so with Strix you're going
to predominately be it a little bit more
focus that's a entry and
high-performance mid-range series of
motherboards in terms of the price band
okay um and it's going to be kind of
like a trickle-down effect where a lot
of the cutting-edge features and
functions that we saw in the
highest-energy boards start to kind of
get incorporated into those strict
series so if you're building a system
for gaming first Strix is probably where
you're going to want to go oh that's not
again not to say that any of these other
boards can't do gaming and then of
course the rog series the cream of the
crop basically whatever you guys can
think of that you want to throw into
high-end boards that's where the ROG
goes but you've expanded the line too
there's there's there's both the more
expensive feature-rich ones but also the
sort of more affordable ones as well now
correct so for ROG you know we
now have a very expensive product line
and when you tie in Strix there's a lot
of boys that you're going to be able to
pick one but from specifically the
launch boards you're going to have the
hero you're going to have the code and
you're going to have the formula if Coke
is new yes code is brand new and so
these are going to definitely sit at the
higher end of the spectrum so for users
that I think really want to focus first
and foremost on aesthetics extremely
specialized features and functions
advanced audio design really robust
overclocking and really looking for
attention to detail I think a lot all
aspects of the board for an enthusiast
already built a course you're going to
want to gravitate towards RG okay and we
have the hero and the formula today so
I'm going to put links down in the
description to shortcuts if you want to
jump straight to the overviews any of
these sports we're going to be doing a
little bit more detail on each one
before we do that what would you say are
kind of the non-negotiables that you
have that sort of cover all the boards
from sort of a certain point up the
features that you were like every board
has to have this and so every board does
yeah so historically with the way we've
always tried to frame this as usually
kind of from our perspective would call
non-negotiables of design right and so
these are really kind of the foundation
and making sure that if you go about
building a system you're going to get
this kind of guaranteed level of
experience so I think the first one is
aesthetics aesthetics has increasingly
become really important when you go
about building your system even when we
talk about quote unquote budget real
builds like if you're building like a
$750 system doesn't mean it has to look
bad it's not a match that yours can
match you still want it to look good you
still want to be able to have I think a
consistent ID and a specialized look and
feel so I think regardless of any of
these boards you look at you're going to
see that they've got a really strong and
specialized design aesthetic and we've
tried to also make sure that they
complement I think that the targeted
kind of themes that we see in terms of
color builds that are popular in the
communities of course with the prime you
get that white so there's a lot of
different types of white chassis that
are on the market and of course white
components like a dual series of
graphics cards and a number of other
types of peripherals and products that
are out there and I also like white
purposely for contrast perspective too
so I like sometimes throwing it in black
or silver builds oh yeah just to be able
to add contrast it doesn't always have
to be white on white I'm so I think
that's interesting so like just that
there's no real strong like color theme
with any of these I mean maybe a little
bit more some of the military theme with
the with the tough boards but even
that's very
subtle so if you wanted to have like oh
I want a purple build or a yellow build
or something like that any of these
should pretty much match up with that of
course with the right touches but that's
a that's kind of the beauty of making
your onion system make it make it work
for you and you make a perfect point
there and that's probably the ending
point I think on the aesthetics is is
that we consciously made an effort
especially with the gaming series of
boards where we know that there's going
to be probably more of a focus when it
comes to RGB lighting and having a lot
of secondary colors whether it's only
components or accessories whether it's a
C's or cables or fans or whatever might
be to make sure that those boards are
essentially monochromatic right so that
you're looking at kind of silver gray
and black tones so that that's always
going to complement any color color
scheme that you want to go with so any
other non-negotiables that across the
for sure so that's actually the next one
is I would say that a big focus for this
generation is going to be RGB lighting
so right now just a little bit before
the launch of this is e2 somebody's
chipset we had just finalized what we
called our era or a sync initiative so
this was essentially the ability to have
all a seuss components be synchronized
in terms of how you can control the RGB
lighting experience so that went from
the motherboard to the graphics card to
LED strips to compatible chassis x' to
our Claymore keyboard to our spot the
mouse and now even DRAM modules so
across the board it's really the first
time that you can have a consistent
lighting experience that can be uniquely
controlled and so for this generation of
course all the boards have been phased
and to be able to offer this type of
synchronization which i think is
fantastic and we've upped the ante by
pretty much the majority of them you're
going to see are going to have to RGB
headers that are built on nice and we've
also strategically placed them so
generally when you find that there's
going to be the two headers one is going
to be placed at the top of the board and
then another one at the bottom of the
board so that works out really well when
you have to kind of run the LED strip
maybe on the top end and you want to
have it kind of hidden in the internal
cavity for the top of the chassis or
maybe you're running out to an LED strip
that's built into the chassis or
something along those lines so I think
that's really awesome and a question
that you had asked as well is that we
have also incorporate even more
granularity and control so you're going
to be able to have the ability to
customize things like sequencing where
you want the LED chain to start off and
then you can also go ahead and
independent control for each one of the
connected devices under the Auris office
what are you talking about other devices
that are connected individual zones on
the board itself as well as the
individual RGB leads that come off of
there
wonderful for everyone except for the
few people who are just totally sick of
the RGB trend but you know what you can
just turn the lights off too I mean
that's always that's always an option
yeah and you don't know and I think you
know one touch little point there too is
that you don't always have to focus on
making it flashy like a lot of times
what I tend to do is that end up having
just a synchronized kind of more ambient
light and I think that when you execute
it like that even we have all the
devices it can look really clean and
just it adds a little bit of pop to the
system but it's not necessarily like
you're trying to have everything just be
lit up like a Christmas journey so tons
of flexibility there sorry for the train
rolling by but we're going to press on
other non-negotiables
so next one way I think would be the
audio design so we've really been kind
of an industry leader at trying to
incorporate specialized audio design and
we've pretty much seen now that every
competitor out in the marketplace has
adopted what we originally innovated and
implemented our tissues motherboards
which was the isolated audio design
right and that's pretty much par for the
course all these boards of course all
have an isolated audio design they have
an operational amplifier built on board
they have a deep pop filter they've got
a lot of really great stuff but what's
really special is that we code work with
real tech so this is the first time in
quite a number of years that we have a
new real tech codec that's being
implemented so this is the s12 20 and
this is a really special audio codec and
you're going to pretty much find this on
every board with the exception of the
mark 2 okay that we have here so all of
these now feature this very very
high-end audio codec and one of the
really special aspects about is is that
as significantly improved dynamic range
which is really important in terms of it
capturing you know your your lows and
then your maximum highs and then also
the signal noise ratio on both input and
output has been significantly improved
and the reason why that's really
important is that if you're doing
anything like streaming are you doing
any tape recording and you're using both
your line in and your lying out if
don't want to necessarily make the
investment in like a prosumer like DAC
or something like that to be able to
really be able to get a high quality
level you can now feel really
comfortable to the line level input
quality is very good on the board next
and of course for some of our higher-end
boards I like the rog series they take
it even to the next level where we've
evolved the work that we did the
foundation with on working with Sabre
and we've incorporated even a more
advanced ESS 9023 Sabre DAC on there so
we'll talk a little bit more about some
of that cool stuff but I think audio for
this generation is really awesome so
music movies games videos whatever you
can be doing you can get a really great
audio experience wonderful alright uh
any other any any fan controls hand
controls of course you know you know me
I'm a stickler for when it comes to fan
controls I think they're always super
interesting and super important I think
about making sure that your system is
not only efficiently cooled but it's
also quiet right I mean I could having a
system that's loud and I want to be able
to really manage how everything works so
all of these boards they feature our fan
expert technology so that means that
brasstacks when you get either into the
UFO or into the operating system you're
going to be able to go ahead and have
unique control over every single header
3 pin or 4 pin a new addition for this
generation is that for all the chassis
fan headers we can automatically detect
whether they're a DC or PWM based fan
before you had to manually go in there
and select whether it was a PWM or DC
fan but we can now of course do all the
previous stuff that we were able to do
so we can calibrate every single fan
figure out its minimum and its maximum
also another very important point that a
lot of people forget about is that
there's temperature input mapping on all
the boards oh nice so that means that
historically your CPU fan and any of the
fans you have connected only respond to
the CPU temperature but course with our
boards
you can have the fans respond to
different temperature input sources so
for this generation we've even phased in
the GPU for them so if you want to have
a let's say your front intake fans and a
chassis respond to the GPU as opposed to
the CPU you can do that and that
actually makes a lot more sense a lot of
times when you're playing game the CPU
is very well cooled and it might be
sitting like at 50 60 degrees but your
GPU could be getting into 75 80 degrees
so it makes more sense to actually have
the ramping or intake airflow respond to
the GPU and not to the CPU because and
most gaming
situate scenarios the CPU is actually
going to be running cooler than the
graphics card exilim so great to have
that option yeah
and there's definitely even a lot more
that's packed in in terms of the fan
controls will touch a little bit when we
kind of talk about the formula in some
of the add-on functions okay but
definitely three users they don't want
to forget the granularity and control of
also being able to assign the output
signal for the fan headers which is
pretty cool so while we're going to talk
about maybe number of fan headers people
forget that if I can set any fan header
to a PWM output that means I can buy
cheap just PWM splitter cable mm-hmm and
then power that but from the power
supply but have all my fans actually
controlled by the motherboard so that's
great like a chassis where you might
have like three friend intake fans mhm
just connect those to one single header
because they can be grouped and
controlled by one single one so even
though the board might have six which
maybe you're in your chassis or your
build you're going to use twelve you
could actually cover that easily by one
single board because we have the ability
to do that output control nice save
money on fan controllers yes okay uh so
shall we start in on the prime board
sure all right guys so this is the z2 78
- a yep so part of the prime series
black and white aesthetic of course like
all the boards cable across sister's as
well as support for ddr4 and this board
has a lot going on I mean considering
that it is what you would kind of
consider your main stream offering yeah
what we consider our entry level type
entry level entry level board so it's
going to be sitting around that how
about $150 price point but you're not
really missing anything you got our full
digital power delivery controller design
so of course you're going to get a great
management experience for being able to
course overclock it or tune for
efficiency you've got USB 3.0 you got
USB 3.1 speaking of that also of course
we have our new specialized USB 3.1
internal header oh yeah which is great
because for the latest generation of
classes that are coming to the market
from companies like in when the anvi
there's a header that's going to allow
you to go ahead and have flexibility
that you can just run that straight into
it and be able to maximize the
throughput
updates from some of the previous
generations are also going to be that
we've incorporated the safe slot design
there too so while really most users
don't necessarily need to worry about
that legitimately in terms
having their piece I saw break or
anything if you do move your system from
place to place or you just want to
switch you have confidence in there it's
nice in terms of an addition to have on
the board it's also important to note
that every bore that we're going to talk
about fully supports Intel obtained okay
CH is going to be a requirement if you
want to run Intel opting in conjunction
with your hard drive whether it's a
mechanical hard driver and SSD it has to
be a Z 270 chipset it has to be using a
KB Lake series CPU okay so and we are of
course a valid a partner with Intel in
that respect if you're looking for other
cutting-edge IO tech - just like in
previous generations all the boards
including this one they can support
Thunderbolt VR just our Thunderbolt 3
adding card ok so you don't have to pay
the immediate cost of having that built
on board one of the nice thing to also
say on this board is that it like all
our other boards is it we talked about
that all these boards have a high number
of fan headers but some unique things
that in addition is you got the fan
extension card which is a great little
add-on 20 bucks gives you three more
additional headers or four views it like
a splitter so you can even have more
connected fans you've got a dedicated
all-in-one water pump header which is
nice especially for all the users using
those type of things and you've got a
high amperage header so the high bridge
header a lot of people kind of wonder
well what is that really all about and
it can really be used in a couple
scenarios of course you could just use
it to power fan but it could also be
useful in situations where you want to
power actually a higher performing a
water cooling pump so you usually see
those broken down in terms of white here
so you can see that we've got one that
says a i/o and then the other one says
high amp that's pretty straightforward
and then in terms of all the standard
stuff that you would expect you know a
course have on you know an Intel NIC and
you know both type a and type C
connectors for USB 3.1 and you know
great build for all of you throughout so
this is a yes for got m dot 2 down here
as well yeah so you got do Linda - so
you got one right at the top and then we
have another one down here like it is
we've tried to maximize a thermal
isolation so in most situations let's
say if you're initially going for one
use the bottom of course because this is
going to generally get the best airflow
from the front and you're minimizing ah
hot hot air from the GPU and from the
CPU section you're going to be running
too then of course you've got to go in
that configuration that says many u dot
2 connectors this time rather than
any reason behind that I think it's just
because you're seeing there's not as
many drives and the additional drives
that have come out to the market outside
of the Intel 750 series their focus a
little bit more towards the
professionals here segmentation of the
market okay so it is still awesome
though and it definitely if you're
looking for big capacity drives keep in
mind that you can now get you to and
over 4 terabytes and so pretty awesome
that was nice
that's why it's a little bit more common
on let's say like our x99 series and if
you really do need it you can use the
hyper get to exactly add that on with an
MDOT 2 slot alright moving over to the
Tough Series and we'll start off with
this one this is the mark 2 tough Z 270
and this board a little bit more
lightweight a little bit smaller the
slightly reduced ATX size so it's not
quite as wide so it should fit in
slightly smaller cases depending on your
situation
but this is a much more affordable Tough
Series board than we've seen before yeah
well it it's pretty similar to the mark
2 right now in terms of being a price
aggressive board so it's very similar to
the price ban that you're going to see
for the dash a and really kind of some
people with a wonder what's the big
difference between like the dashing and
the Tough Series is really it's in the
heart of the software so with dashingly
give you the full complete auto tuning
technology so for dynamic real-time auto
overclocking which is really awesome
right CPU specific cooling specific all
that great stuff Tough Series doesn't
have that but for this generation we
have updated the Thermal radar software
to include performance tuning so it
doesn't have the same level of
customization for a complete dynamic
real-time auto overclocking that the
prime series does but you can still get
one-click optimization really where the
differentiation is going to come in for
tough is going to be in the validation
for specialized items so things like I
said like Xeon Phi quad row cards Tesla
cards things along those lines also the
componentry all the componentry gentling
is a very high level in terms of its
specification so we've got like 10k
rated capacitors versus like 5k rated
caps you're going to find on the prime
series of boards the ESD connections a
lot of people forget about this but the
most common point of failure I'm pretty
much on always on motherboards unless
it's like end-user induced is going to
be electrostatic discharge sometimes
from like plugging in flash drives
removal of different devices or shorting
on metal metal contact and so all the
i/o
throughout the entire port not only on
the
back but also for your front connectors
have much much higher performing what
are called contact and air discharge ESD
diodes okay so that allows the board to
essentially be much more durable in the
long term so if you really really really
care about having the most durable type
of board it's a great choice
also for cooling purposes most of the
basic boards like prime only have a few
temperature input sources and so outside
of the CPU with the tough series you're
always going to have a huge amount of
thermal input sources generally a
minimum of at least 10 so you can really
manage your fans to respond to exactly
the different type of temperature points
it's like you've got your top PCIe zone
and your lower PCIe zone yeah but you
there's lots of zones I also noticed you
still have two M two slots on this board
which is also freaking awesome a lower
profile seems like in this area over
here is there any particular reason for
that
no it's just it just says it's just a
cost factor in terms of trying to
maintain it but we still do a lot of
intelligent design aspects so these are
all still right angle to allow for easy
connections right and you still have a
total of six ports on here so there's
nothing really compromised about really
the only thing that's I'd say clear drop
down would be the audio it's still a
very good quality real tech I think 8087
audio codec
still has isolation operational
amplifier and not as nice as that update
that's on the the primate okay and there
are a couple mount points here for the
3d printed stuff that you guys started
with last generation they're actually a
couple of those on the prime board as
well just on over on the side and that
will allow you to mount 3d printed
things that can do things we've got a if
you check out the community page that
will I'm sure we've linked in the
description you can get pretty much all
types of things like name plates fan
holders cable combs on all kinds of
different items that we've produced to
allow you to go ahead and customize the
board's awesome alright let's move on to
the mark wait this is the mark to know
mark mark I'm sorry I got them backwards
I kept doing that before as well alright
so this is kind of the full fat version
of the board not only do you have the
full thermal armor covering the entire
thing which I've always really enjoyed
just because it gives a really cool look
to the board and this one in particular
I was mentioning to JJ earlier just a
lot of a little design element details
kind of scattered through here just some
texture stuff going
on in here I mean it's a little bit of
like a digi camo look with some
something different texture I don't know
it's it's a weird aesthetic like
attention to detail that you normally
wouldn't expect to see on something like
a motherboard but I feel like it works
really well it's actually inspired by
modern advanced warfare kind of concepts
okay so like in the latest generation
you know like Call of Duty where you
have like machinery built into the
soldier right and it's the same type of
concept so that's kind of what our ID
team kind of went for it's just kind of
infusing this kind of digital camo but
that has also a little bit of kind of
like an armature perspective to it
awesome um but really the areas that you
get the improvement on here is that this
one gets the bumped up audio codec
compared to the entry board we've got
the far more advanced thermal armor
design which not only looks cool but has
all the channeling technology like
previous generations you can drop in the
assist fan there and there will you go
off the variants exactly you've got the
flow technology so you can channel the
different air
you've got leb RGB LED lighting zones on
here as well so you can go ahead and
control them these can customize the
colors on there you've got the RGB
singing that's been incorporated you
also have the dust offenders like always
too so that if you want to kind of go
for a more blacked-out level of look
there's also a subtle difference in
terms of the fan control technology this
one still uses the more advanced what's
called tough ice processor which is an
independent processor that does all the
load balancing and all the pull
monitoring on a low level so that CPU
doesn't do it this allows for a faster
response and more accurate monitoring
information so once again if you're
really looking for the board that's kind
of kind of have this insane level of
cooling and monitoring control this is
really going to be a cup before that
you're going to want to take a look at
there are ten four pin fan headers on
this board there's four here there's two
more right where'd they go there's four
here there's two more here and there's
four more along the top and then keep in
mind this one can still use the veneks
then you can stem extension cart you can
still add more yeah tough for a fire
metal backplate as well I also really
like that both for building and the look
and just keeping things durable so yeah
good job on this board yeah that's a
cool
all right let's move on oh wait we
forgot I don't know just a one update
some people also wonder about a recent
update that we did on tough syriza's
most of now fulfill on having dual NICs
Oh
previously in previous generations you
didn't have ones that had just so this
one has two gigabit Intel Ethernet ports
if that's something that you can you can
leverage oh and I also was going to
mention also 2 m dot 2 slots one that's
covered up by here by this little
protective piece as well as a vertical
one because they ran out of space but
vertical still works yep well it's also
about thermal isolation I placed in a
different place but we also want to try
to make sure that we're always taking
thermals in consideration there's always
at least two reasons for everything all
right we're moving over to the Strix
series we have a single board from that
series this is the z2 70e gaming and JJ
told me that there's actually going to
be a pretty wide variety of boards in
the strict series since that's kind of
the main gaming series so if this wasn't
doesn't line up to your expectations or
if you wanted something that's a little
bit less or a little bit more there are
probably other options as well yeah if
you generally want more you're probably
going to start stepping into the ROG
territory okay but definitely if you're
looking for a little bit more price
aggressive but you still want a lot of
the core Strix features you could drop
down so this is the - II so if you want
to drop down take for instance you go to
the - F but I really love the look at
this board I think that it's got an
absolutely really clean monochromatic
design it's got this laser etched PC
edge design which I think looks really
interesting there's a distinctive if
it's polygons on it yeah it's got a 2
zone RGB lighting of course you have the
aura sync a connectivity you got the
slave slot updates of course have the
improved audio design and one really
interesting thing too for this
generation 2 is their dual operational
amplifiers now historically on most
boards when you have an operational
amplifier it's only designed for the
front headphone connection but now for
the line level out so depending on how
you had your setup connected right you
might not essentially get the benefits
of that isolated design in that respect
just when I was one for you yeah so here
you have it for both so that's another
nice area in terms of the improvement
and also for some people that maybe if
they're upgrading from older platforms
so like you know z68 P 60 70 77 X 58 any
of that era and they were familiar with
our G boards our G boards never had the
opportunity technology
only until the last generation they
formally incorporated it in so it's
really cool that I think that first
Strix and for the ROG they all feature
that Auto tuning technology that fanox
for technology so all the great stuff
that you might have seen and wanted in
the prime Series in the past is now
available on these boards that's what I
hope there's also a very big update to
the sonic studio software and well we're
going to get into the ROG boards this
kind of does cover something that is
consistent on both of them so some of
the really cool things that we do have
is that you can have assignable audio
assignment per application and all the
customization for audio profiling can be
done per application acetate for
instance that if you want to go ahead
and assign your game to output through
HDMI and then maybe something else to
output through the line double output
and then something else that output
through your headphones you could have
each individual application have
different audio sources set for that you
could then uniquely set in a previous
generation we had our advanced profiles
that we were developing for music movies
and games but they were blanket audio
profiles now we can actually apply the
profiles per each application so if you
want to actually purposely have game for
let's say you know your game that you're
jumping into so you're jumping to grand
theft auto or evolve or whatever it
might be then you jump back into chrome
and you're you know you're listen to
Spotify you're watching YouTube you can
have a different audio preset so the
level of granularity and control that I
think that we're offering to gamers and
enthusiasts for this generation is
something that's really awesome and once
you kind of really get used to being
able to have this subtle level of
control it's going to become addictive
you're really going to go I can't go
backwards that's kind of effect that's
gonna be really beneficial for streamers
yeah totally like yeah that's 100% where
we really got a lot of the inspiration
and focus is for heavy multitasking so
what we find is people they're jumping
in applications and then for streamers
that want the ability to kind of
customize and this also will work with
our perfect voice technology so our
perfect voice technologies and it has
advanced post-processing
for not only incoming but outgoing audio
and you can also now set this up
specifically to that so if you want to
have just the perfect voice set to be
processing let's say your incoming game
audio but you don't want to active on
anything else you can do that so a lot
of really cool advanced little
controlling all the stuff that we'd
expect like we've already talked about
um two USB 3.0
one to them tattooed yeah all that stuff
is going to be I love having to him that
two slits also this one has the RGB
headers both the top and the bottom and
what else oh and Wi-Fi yeah so that's
another kind of think call-out is that
for the previous generation to
programming or it didn't have Wi-Fi so
this is a two by two eight eleven AC
that's extremely fast you know for
people are wanting for a reference
benchmark on average with a good AC
router you're talking about three to
four times the speed of a 10100 Ethernet
cable so very very good throughput very
good range and you get bluetooth on
there too so glorious the z2 7te gaming
I think that is a wonderful all around
gaming board from the Strix line but
let's kick it up a notch
yeah with the are oh geez we're going to
start off with this one here which is
the hero named after my dog hero not not
exactly but in close enough he's right
over there snoring so if we have will
honor him at least so this the hero was
it was the hero first started last
generation was that to now it's actually
been now multiple generations there you
can go back for more yeah Wow time slips
by so quickly
yeah so the hero was very welcomed by a
lot of people because ROG boards were
typically a little out of reach but the
hero kind of kind of entry yeah brought
a dance it to being much more enriched I
know I think Steve got one of the first
hero boards right when it first launched
so we have metal heatsinks which look
really cool and just want to point that
out until that fresh metal that's
actually a good point and so that some
people might wonder overclocking
capabilities and pretty much all these
boards are going to be identical in
terms of having a great reliable solid
OC experience whether you're talking
about 4.6 4.7 we're winning plus
gigahertz it's not going to be an issue
what you're going to find a difference
is is that in the vrm components and in
the heatsink designs are going to get
more advanced on the higher imports you
go with really the main benefit there is
you're just talking about thermal
efficiency and across the entirety of
the vrm and how it dissipates
temperatures so generally if you can
keep the vrm even cooler and you can
distribute it more efficiently you're
going to maybe get a little bit better
stability under heavy loads and under
aggressive overclocking so it's not a
question that you're necessarily going
to guarantee better overclocking
experience but you can help to ensure
that the
overall that our long-term reliability
under heavy consistent load okay
so especially if you're a gamer that's
going under really demanding workloads
or you're simultaneously doing stuff
maybe streaming and gaming it may be a
little bit better option if you know
you're consistently going to be
hammering the system but other areas
that are course going to be different of
course is the id design it's got a far
more specialized id design and the audio
is going to be even further kicked up in
comparison to what we had on the Strix
pre-selects you get all the great stuff
that we already talked about on the
Strix and all the previous generations
so you know pre input power regulator
we've got the D pop filter the audio
grade capacitors the isolation that S
audio codec right but this one
incorporates the ESS zebra DAC so we get
some serious high-quality DAC processing
that's on here and you tie that in and
with everything that we've done in terms
of the sonic studio suite that we talked
about plus some really new cool things
that we've done in sonic radar sonic
Raider it's got an overhaul that we've
been working on for the last two years
it's an entirely brand new algorithm it
has a new type of display mapping that
works a really really really granular in
terms of showing you I'd say a the
result but with a varying level of
brightness on the actual radar feel so
before all sounds wait essentially be
prioritized at the same time and so that
can be difficult in the line of fire
figuring out which one is the one that
you want to focus on but now there's a
lot more granular control on how it's
displayed and for users that don't
necessarily want to focus on a specific
audio type that we haven't processed in
you can now select specific frequencies
that you want dialing to so if you want
to have like more so if you really
subtly pick up things like bass tones or
treble tones in certain types of maps or
game engines you can have it display
those so a lot of really cool
customization the chav on there but one
other really cool thing that you're
going to have on the RG series ports is
also a commitment to people that want to
have high performance real water-cooling
configurations and so what we have down
here on the board is going to be water
temperature sensor connections so for
input and output so usually depending on
how you set up your radiator and
everything along those lines if you
really want to be critical and monitor
everything you can go ahead and
can make connections for your fittings
that have those sensors and you can
monitor that information and if you also
want to monitor a flow rate you can also
go ahead and connect that there as well
so when you talk about the level of fan
control flexibility the ability to run
and control your pwm pumps and add to
that I mean the water cooling level
control and connectivity is just
absolutely awesome wonderful and I also
want to point out dual MDOT - once again
this one also has of course that USB 3.1
header debug LED and surface mounted
jazz nice nice solid start button
they're dead to kick things off and on
the headers - some people might always
wonder we're still also actively
supporting the OC panel in the ROG front
bases accessories so for users that want
to be able to have that really high
quality audio connection all the way
from the board all the way to the front
of the chassis those accessories are
fully supportive on this one again has
the RGB outs at the top and bottom for
RGB LED strips I've been waiting so long
all right um this is the m9f Maximus 9
formula and it is it's wonderful I've I
did some some footage of it earlier
hopefully that's playing right now and
it looks it looks wonderful so you have
but so it's not called ROG or to the
thermal armor when it's a it's ROG armor
it's ours on here yeah but it's
essentially performing the same tasks I
it's a little bit on on the tough series
it's actually functional I was ok
because it actually has channeling and
venting really on the ROG board we it's
really first and foremost anesthetic ok
yeah because I don't have the same type
of assist fans or
shunting or flow rate that control that
you can have them ok well I stand
corrected this does have of course water
cooling support in the vrm so vrm our
cooling updated for this generation
aidid and already designed from ek for
this we actually developed an entirely
new cinch micro channel design buckle so
we even get better performance in the
previous generation it's a it's copper
it's absolutely awesome
of course it's fully hybrid though so
you want to run it entirely pass it just
like this you're still going to get a
great experience but if you want to drop
in water your band you're good to go
still do that they ditch the g1 quarter
fittings up and I'm just kidding they
still do and quarter
but other than that I mean like
everything I feel like you could want
just about what are you guys going to do
with the extreme I don't know just gonna
have to wait we'll have to wait and see
what the extreme does alright so SLI
support that I mean a lot of these are
pretty much thing is optimized for
two-way cuz you're not going to do
anything more than that on this platform
but RGB different RGB zones I'm guessing
yeah multiple multiple RGB zones so you
got a the PCIe you got down here for the
PCH you also have it here and then even
actually for this generation we've gone
back and customized this ah in the past
it's been a little small point but
people are kind of like I I just want
that much more I said that's okay yeah
that was actually one one thing that I
pointed out with the last version so
nice to update that as well the i/o back
here has a fixed IO shield yeah so this
was actually brought over from the
absolute highest end board that we've
pretty much ever made with our rampage v
extreme anniversary edition board so is
this fully integrated IO shield so for
anybody that's ever forgotten to put an
ayah shield they will absolutely love
this so it makes things even easier
there's actually also additional
durability benefits because of the
direct proximity that we can make with
all the actual contact headers for all
the IO ports it significantly improves
the air discharge and direct contact
discharge nice so on that same thing
that we talked about like I'm tough
boards where we get superior protection
our G boards already get upgraded ESD
answer diodes but that's also put in
place so this board really is absolutely
just packed to the gills you know one of
the little thing that we didn't really
touch up it's hard to see is the
software package it's been updated
across the board so there's new versions
of RAM cache and RAM disk software
they've also been updated - Felisa for
nvme day solutions so you can get some
really nice healthy performance gains
from trying that stuff out and that's
one of those things that definitely you
want to spend a little bit more time to
find out about if you are interested rog
don't sell the software short because
some of the software that gets included
really takes things to that next level
whether we're talking about from a
gaming perspective and packet priority
software audio customization or some of
those other pieces in terms of
performance oriented software fabulous
and of course still has the ROG armor
yeah ROG backplate
yeah the RG backplate on the back that
is all metal as well and it's just heavy
I don't know I like when a board is
heavy is if it's a premium board is
seriously if you're looking for a really
high-end build where you want to be able
to control I think the aesthetic it
looks fantastic and I think when you
incorporate also the customized 3d
pieces if you look to get some of those
produce we have some really really nice
ones like we have specialized ROG I
cable holders to allow you to kind of
right angle all your cables that really
complement the look and feel the board
so some really really cool stuff that
we've got there and if I didn't mention
it don't lend out to again one is a
protected by the panel back down here in
one is vertical at the bottom yep
there's dual MDOT two everywhere edges
it's makes me so so happy um but that's
all the motherboards that we have to
talk about today guys I'm kind of sad
that we're at the end but it's been
wonderful JJ thank you so much for
coming by today as always it's been
awesome to be here and thanks all you
guys for watching of course leave
comments in the comment section down
below let us know what you think let us
know which of these boards is your
favorite because I know I can't decide
but I'm sure I'll think about it a lot
more maybe I'll come up with something
leave me a thumbs up if you want to and
subscribe to the channel for more
content come at you very soon thanks for
watching and we'll see you guys next
