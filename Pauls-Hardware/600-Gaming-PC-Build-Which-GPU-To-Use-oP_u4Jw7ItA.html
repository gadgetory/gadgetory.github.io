video bares a little bit of explanation
right here at the top because I'm doing
a couple things at the same time first
off you guys may have seen me build this
system which is the about one thousand
one hundred and fifty dollar build in
the cooler master master box q 500l
which I did just a week or two ago this
was my monthly build for April but I've
decided to sort of reconfigure it
because we now have a new graphics card
that has just launched the nvidia
geforce gtx 1650 which is a 150 dollar
graphics card but nvidia didn't actually
post drivers for the press to use so on
launch day for this card there are no
actual benchmarks that you guys can look
at to say is that a good card or is it a
bad card by the time you watch this
video there will be some more benchmarks
out on this but all this is to say i
have decided to do a couple things for
today's video one is i'm going to be
reconfiguring this system in the master
box acute 300l which is a $40 version of
the case versus the q 500 l also it's
micro ATX which was the original intent
for this system also I'm going to be
answering the question in a follow-up
video where I do testing of which
graphics card you should pair with a
$600 build like this because the new
system is gonna retail for about $600
for all the parts inside the 1650 is
$150 but we also have the radiant rx 570
which has been out for a while but you
can now also get for about 150 dollars
which one is faster which one should you
drop into a system if your budget is
around $600 today we're gonna put the
system together or sort of rebuild the
system and then like I said I'll follow
up and do some testing so let me do sort
of an awkward rundown of parts here
first off graphics card of course is
going to be this ZOTAC GeForce GTX 16 50
this is the gaming version and I believe
this does not require supplemental power
that's one of the selling points of the
1650 is it's a pretty low power
requirement it can run off of the 75
Watts provided by the PCI Express bus I
might be swapping this rx 570 this is
just the only one I have on hand here
it's a 4 gig version there are 8 gig
versions of the rx 570 so if I can find
one for 150 bucks I'll drop that in
instead the rest of the parts are
already installed in the Q 500 L I'm
gonna be disassembling that to drop it
into the Q 300 L so that's a savings of
$20 versus the Q 500 and of course it
will actually be micro ATX
that'll work with our B 450 and steel
legend motherboard from asrock the
graphics card we used originally as an
RT X 2070 that's $500 and it's a $600
build so obviously we can't use that
anymore
the processor is arisin seven 2700 which
is going to cost over $200 it's a good
eight core 16 thread CPU and it does use
the more refined manufacturing process
12 nanometer that the second gen rise
and stuff uses however we're gonna be
taking advantage of the low low prices
currently available for first gen rising
stuff every rise in seven 1,700 here
which we're going to be using for today
but in the parts list I have the rise in
seven 1600 which is 6 cores 12 threads
and you can get for about 115 dollars
right now which is an insanely good deal
you can get really good deals on the
1700 as well so if you need the extra
cores and threads consider dropping that
in for a few more dollars but that is
where some more of our price savings is
going to come in and by and large the
rest of the stuff we're gonna use is the
same so we've got the same Coolermaster
MWe gold 650 watt power supply which you
can get for about 55 dollars after
mail-in rebate we've got the same memory
kits you want 16 gigs or 2 by 8 gigs of
3,200 speed rising compatible memory and
our Flex kit is doing the job there I'm
gonna leave the Intel 6 series SSD in
there which is about $65 if you go for
the 512 gig of it right now
you can save another 15 dollars by going
with a standard SATA SSD and that will
not affect your gaming performance and
then of course at the back the queues
300l just the $20 cheaper version of the
Q 500 l here and part of my reason going
for this decision too is that this was
originally in 1150 dollar system after I
built this I checked out the gamers
nexus review on the Q 500 l which I will
link down in the description if you guys
want to check it out the airflow on this
case is not the best so as a result it's
going to be better suited for a lower
power system like a $600 issue rig like
I'm setting up today rather than trying
to wedge more power into it with like an
8 core 16 thread processor and an RT X
27 T so I'm thinking the $600
configuration will work better and now
I'm going to put it all together
the initial build has been disassembled
so now we have the real parts list for
today which I've already kind of gone
over everything so I'm not going to go
over it again but since the motherboard
is already pretty much assembled and
pretty much gonna be removing the
existing RGB heat sink fan I think I'm
gonna keep using this because you can't
get a race fire that will have
effectively the same performance with at
least a 1,700 like I'm using I went to
all that trouble of rotating this so I
kind of want to leave it and it looks
nice when it's lit up - that's a Doh
time to get back to work on the rebuild
so other than swapping in the different
CPU at this point it's been pretty much
a transplant out of the queue 500l and
into the queue 300l the cases are really
really similar in most respects a couple
things to point out the input outputs at
the back here on the queue 300l are
these temporary ones that snap off I'd
recommend snapping those off before you
install the motherboard just a minor
thing but also this case only ships with
one fan just like the q500 so gonna be
adding another 140 millimeter fan at the
front the front intake on this case is
kind of blocked off by these
perforations here this is what gamers
Nexus discovered it's not a whole lot of
room for airflow here but we at least
want to have something active up against
there pulling in some fresh air and who
knows maybe people who get this case in
the future can figure out some decent
mods there to open up the airflow a
little bit I don't think that'd be too
hard to do at this point though just
have a couple steps left to do gonna
install the fan at the French and then
install the graphics card and get
everything wired up and plugged in
front intake fan is installed this is a
hundred and forty millimeter fan and
this is kind of making me lean a little
bit more towards maybe doing a follow-up
mod on this case when I test it to just
cut out a big hole right here and allow
plenty of room for airflow I'll think
about it let me know in the comments if
you guys think I should do that
this build being sort of a rebuild has
come together pretty quickly and I'm now
just ready to install the graphics card
which again is the zotac gaming version
of the GT x16 50 and 60 and 50 I think
is gonna have a decent amount of
discussion on it in the next few days
and probably weeks because for a lot of
people who are gonna go with a discrete
graphics card about a hundred and fifty
dollars is kind of the entry-level price
I think for people who are doing a more
healthy budget maybe 700 to 900 dollars
total for the whole system you're
definitely gonna want to look at
something a higher end for a graphics
card sixteen sixty and sixteen sixty TI
have proven to be very good values for
the money that you pay for them can't
100% say that for this card quite yet
also there's gonna be a few variants of
this card this one for example is a more
entry-level version so it's got a
plastic shroud single fan on top it's
only about a hundred and sixty one
millimeters long measured from the
bracket when it comes to the PCB the
plastic shroud extends a little bit
beyond that so maybe 165 but this should
fit in really really small form-factor
systems also a benefit for a small
form-factor and lower power systems is
going to be the fact that there's no
supplemental power requirement for this
it gets all the power via the 75 Watts
deliver B the via the PCI Express bus
which is this shorty part of it right
there by the way that's where the power
comes from there will also be higher-end
versions of this card to those some that
do have supplemental power and those
will probably be able to run at higher
clock speeds I'll be testing this so
I'll report on the clock speeds but some
of the things that we have question
marks about when it comes to the 1650
are going to be the coup de coeur count
you get 896 CUDA cores with the 16 50
and that is about thirty percent less
than the sixteen sixty which where you
have one thousand four hundred and eight
also the quorum boosts clocks are 1485
and 1665 respectively and that is again
about a hundred megahertz slower than
with the 1660s so you might be able to
get a 1650 that performs a little bit
better and overclocks a little bit
better if you get one that has that
supplemental power for us though it at
least simplify
is the installation because all I have
to do is drop it into the slot here and
there's no extra power required so I got
the graphics card installed the back of
this case is one of these external
mounting plates so you actually want to
screw through the mounting plate in
order to get everything in there but
once it's all in there it's actually
pretty secure there and now that
everything is installed here this case
is feeling pretty solid as well even
though it's a $40.00 case and as I've
mentioned before you know the steel is
not exactly super thick in certain areas
when it's all together because it's
compact and because they've got enrolled
portions around the edges here it
actually stays together really well and
very flexible as I already mentioned you
know you can take this i/o panel and
move it to the top or the bottom or the
side if you want to rotate the side
panel window along with it I feel much
better about this build as a $600 builds
than the one I did in the Q 500 l which
is a 11 $1,150 builds maybe I'll come
back to that one and do an updated
version of that with a different case
that I feel is a little bit more
suitable this one though I'm happy with
and I've even got you know a decent job
going on the cable management here on
the other side as well
I haven't tucked everything back in
there once the side panel goes on it
will do that and I've added this
supplemental PCI Express power connector
so that if I test the 60 and 50 versus
an rx 570 we can gets comparison and the
RX 5 somebody does require extra power
that's one of the trade-offs there it's
going to use more power it's not going
to be as efficient as the 1650 but I
will talk about that in a follow-up
video all right everything's put
together let's hit the power button
damn might be hitting something I'll fix
that
actually conflicting with the front of
the case so happy news the fan up at the
front was just over Titan so it can
press the rubber standoffs and actually
had it conflicting with the front of the
case but I loosened that up and now it's
just fine
spinning providing some airflow to the
rest of the components in the system so
guys that's pretty much gonna wrap it up
for this build I am much happier I think
with this configuration and what the
configuration I recently did and the 500
series version of this case and it's
mainly because I feel like this is more
practical again you could put together
roughly this same system for about $600
and I've put a parts list for that down
in the video description if you guys
want to check it out I was comparing
this to the $500 builds that I was doing
maybe a year ago or two years ago those
had to rely on integrated graphics or
they had to rely on older Intel
processors that were like dual core for
thread now we've managed to fit a six
core 12 thread processor in here we've
got $150 graphics card that is hopefully
faster than the hundred and fifty dollar
graphics cards of two years ago and we
have a ton of expansion room because of
course with this socket you can upgrade
to an 8 core 16 thread AMD Rison 7
processor they also have a ton of room
for a larger or more powerful graphics
card in here which would also be
supported by this power supply which is
a 650 watt power supply you can get away
with a 550 watt but in this bill by the
way you got support for m2 nvme drives
you've got expandability for adding some
additional drives to the system too so I
think this is a system that gets my seal
of approval at least but I shouldn't do
that before I've actually tested it
fully so stay tuned for a follow up
video well test the system with the 1650
in it compare the RX 570 hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed this video and
subscribe if you want to see that video
when it comes out as well as all the
other videos on my youtube channel
thanks again for watching guys we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
