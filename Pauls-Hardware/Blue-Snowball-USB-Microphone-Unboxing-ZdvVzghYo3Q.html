pulsar where today I'm going to be doing
an unboxing of this USB microphone this
is the blue snowball even though it's
actually black alright guys let's take a
closer look at the blue snowball now in
case you're wondering why I bought this
mic it was a bit of an impulse buy I
will admit I'm kind of continuously
looking for different ways to improve
the quality of my videos if I can and I
think audio is one thing that I
definitely don't have an end-all
solution for yet in case you're
wondering what I'm using right now to
record myself
it's a rode videomic pro and it's
actually a really nice mic but right now
I have it positioned way too close to my
face and I'm just looking for something
a little bit more versatile possibly or
I don't know am I just end up using that
one I might just get some more
accessories for the video mic Pro - let
me use it in different configurations
but anyway looking at the outside of the
box here we have some specifications
this is a USB mic so features
plug-and-play design it's compatible
with both Mac and PC no complicated
drivers required it works automatically
with Windows XP Vista and Mac should
work just fine with Windows 7 or Windows
8 as well
dual condenser capsules offer unrivaled
CD quality audio
includes an adjustable adjustable mic
stand as well as the USB cable and it's
good for recording vocals instrumentals
podcasting voice over IP voice
recognition software multimedia hey I am
Yahoo etc etc there's some pictures of
people using the mic doing different
things okay let's look at some of the
features and specs on the back here
alright so cool features which I'm
always looking for cool features dual
capsule cd-quality microphone for
superior sound multiple mic patterns USB
cable rugged adjustable mic stand
there's different languages down here
some extra accessory is available from
blue and then I will note that this is
the gloss black version it's also
available in textured white gloss white
as well as brushed aluminum there's the
other side of the box and next
I'm going to open up the box and take
this mic out first off we have a
snowball you connect our USB guide
picture of its introduction position
applications one two three little
response frequency layout there it's a
couple different modes for this you can
you can do a unidirectional as well as
omnidirectional there's a shock mount
you can get for it software lots of
different languages here look maybe I
should have been looking at the English
version ah that's much better okay okay
so here's a look at the English side of
the manual Tech Specs condenser
microphone three positions so first
position as exploits the cardioid
capsule for speech vocals and podcasting
second position activates cardio capsule
with a -10 decibel pad so if you want to
record louder something that's louder
you use that and that way you won't peek
probably like I've been doing this whole
time since my mic is currently
positioned way too close to my my face
third position is third position is the
Omni capsule that's for recording audio
in all directions so for conferences
interviews or environmental recording
little frequency response guide right
there how to set up the snowball system
requirements setup procedure suggested
application it's okay I'm not going to
walk through the entire manual even
right in those two pictures now here the
accessories there's the mic a little
finish on that so included USB cable
this is kind of your pretty standard USB
a 2 B type cable like you probably see
with a lot of printers kind of silver
color
and here is the included stand which i
think is a nice add-on you can see it's
got the blue logo right there on it
through the legs so tripod Oh sits on
the table like so that you threaded
threaded mount therefore the mic itself
and then it does feature some adjustment
in here by loosening this Center thing
you can raise or lower it by a few
inches at least gives you a little bit
of flexibility and lock that down and
take a closer look at the snowball all
right so here's the glass black version
of the snowball you can see the chrome
blue logo right there on the front
indicator light and tell you that it's
on you can see the Blue Microphones D
snowball and on the side design by blue
assembled in China here's the three
position setting so one two and three as
indicated in the manual finally over
here we have the USB connector so that's
where usually connected via USB to
connect to your computer and finally
here at the bottom is the actual stand
mount which I will I will note really
quickly that's actually got a little bit
of a rocker adjustment as well I'm
totally spinning the wrong part of this
alright
that's all good enough for now so as you
can see stands on the desk and it does
have a little bit of tilt so you can
sort of tilted angle different ways so
depending where you are sitting if you
want to angle it up if it's down below
your if you position it above your ankle
it down it is directional so you do want
to speak into this side of the mic when
it's actually on and that pretty much
wraps it up for this unboxing and that's
going to wrap it up for this video guys
once again this has been my unboxing and
overview of the blue snowball USB
microphone again I will be doing a
comparison of this microphone along with
at least one more maybe a few more in an
additional upcoming video as I try to
determine my best options for getting
good high quality sound here in my
little room where I do my videos but
again if you'd like to see more tech
videos unboxings and other types of
tutorial videos you can find those on my
Paul's Hardware youtube channel don't
forget to subscribe send me a like if
you liked the video
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
