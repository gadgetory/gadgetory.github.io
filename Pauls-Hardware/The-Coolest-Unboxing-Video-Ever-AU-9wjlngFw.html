Oh oh hi there sorry I didn't see you at
first you know there comes a point in
every tech youtubers life when there's
just too many boxes they keep arriving
and eventually they must be unboxed so
that is what this video is all about
I've got a bunch of stuff to take out of
the boxes today and I realized as I was
looking through a few of these things
that there's a little bit of a theme so
today on one of the hottest days in
Southern California so far this summer
I'm going to be doing the coolest
unboxing ever thought I thought I'd
sharpen my knife to get ready not very
good at knife sharpening now I have
boxes here from Thermaltake Corsair
noctua alpha cool and Arctic cooling and
I have decided to start out with the
Corsair boxes that's partially because I
actually already opened at least one of
these so all three of these are from
Corsair starting out with this long one
here and inside we have an H 150 I Pro
they're still using the same fans that
came with the old old version of the H
150 I so these do a good job they can be
a little on the loud side but they are
very performance effective and there is
the actual cooler itself during sixty
millimeter radiator it's got a silver
accents around the pump unit here this
is a sixth generation ASA tech pump
block combo everything you expect from a
solid Corsair third and sixty millimeter
radiator for those who can spit it in
their case it does a very good job
keeping your CPU cool but that's not all
we got a couple more boxes here from
Corsair and these are the ones I'm a
little bit more excited about because
they all have to do with cooling I am
also working on providing more cooling
for the Riptide build and that is what
all these are for actually I already had
some of these fans for the original
build but since I'm doing a 420
millimeter radiator in the top that's 3
by 140 I want to do push pull to take up
a lot of that blank space in the top of
the case and I of course got to stick
with the same fans I'm going everywhere
within the case which is the light loop
series from Corsair they're very
colorful very RGB ish and
I'm embracing that for this build so
there is that should give you enough for
the push-pull and then one more little
guy and here the MP 500 I already have a
968 version of this for the bills but
the MP 500 which is Corsairs
M that to nvme SSD which is a very good
performer 3000 megabytes per second
reads 2400 megabytes per second writes
up to of course now I'm doing a NASPA
freenas build in the bottom of the 1000
d case because it's got space for a mini
ITX case down there
I needed a very specific configuration
of stuff to connect to it because I need
a bunch of hard drives
I need SSDs and I'm running free nests
and FreeNAS you can run off of like an 8
gig USB Drive so I realized that I kind
of need to run that off of the m dot 2
but installing like a 480 gig or 960 gig
to run FreeNAS off of what people would
go crazy for that and give me a really
hard time so I specifically asked for
120 gig version which is still way
overkill for free and asks for a booting
drive but that's what I'm gonna go with
and this will work just fine for that
next up I have another set of packages
from Corsair and for today I had a good
idea of what most of the stuff was that
was gonna arrive but I wasn't sure about
everything so I'm actually not her
percent sure let's see in these boxes so
we shall have to open them to find out
and inside it's another H 150 I prefer
um you know I've already got one of
these course a but now I have two of
them ok that kind of gives me a bit of a
suspicious feeling about what's in these
other two boxes mystery box number two
contains or where RGB ll series fans a
total of six and I guess now that means
I'd be very surprised if this is
anything other than an mp5 M hey look
it's an MP 500 and now I have duplicates
of all that stuff back there alright so
thank you Corsair for sending me two of
everything that I that I asked for but I
actually don't have use for all of this
stuff
I think here's what I'm gonna do if you
guys want to post a comment in this
video I'm gonna do an impromptu giveaway
screw it let's make it international I'm
going to pay myself to ship the H 150 I
Pro and the MP 500 120 gig and I'm not
sure if I'm gonna need these fans or not
it depends on how everything goes with
the configuration but I'll throw in
probably one or two of these boxes of
fans as well so just leave a comment and
I'll give it like a week and then I'll
pick a winner from the comment section
and thanks for watching this video I'm
not gonna advertise this giveaway beyond
this so you might have a pretty decent
chance of winning don't bother posting
multiple comments because I'm gonna use
a thing that'll only give one entry per
person so good luck to any of you guys
who might happen to win this extra stuff
that Corsair sent me a void where
prohibited by law and you know follow
your local laws in your area and
everything of course to our next package
is from Arctic cooling and I ran into
them at Computex they were like hey can
we send you some cooling stuff and I was
like sure and then they've emailed me
since then and I don't think I've done a
very good job of following up with them
but they sent this to me nonetheless and
let's see what's inside oh yeah sorry
Arctic mx4 I have lots of these looks
like they have also included the freezer
33 eSports Edition which looks like an
all black air cooler which I don't my as
a fan of and then we got a couple
biotics f1 25th is air quarter though
it's like we got direct copper heat pipe
contacts which is always the most
effective way for these coolers and it
looks like it's got a nice matte black
finish on the top there with push-pull
120 millimeter fans that come along with
it so I can't speak as to the actual
performance of this cooler off the top
of my head but I will say aesthetically
it looks quite nice and it looks like
it's available in a few different colors
yellow green red and white and it's
about 46 47 dollars at Newegg or about
$50 at Amazon so not quite the
inexpensive price I was hoping for but
hopefully that means it's also a good
cooler since it cost a few more bucks
than your typical 30 ish dollar tower
style air coolers next package here is
from thermal teak I asked for just like
3 or 4 fans
and this was what they sent we got ring
plus fans 20 millimeter 20 centimeter
200 millimeter fans that's actually
actually pretty fun we have a thermal
take sync controller I didn't have one
of these on hand so this is if you want
to connect up multiple thermal take
products all together you can use that
sync controller to control them we got
the ring plus 14 so a hundred and forty
millimeter ring plus fans it looks like
they are five five pins included in this
box thanks is the ring plus 12 so 120
millimeter fans pretty much the same
thing as 140 all are GB they're all
addressable single LEDs they're all PWM
fans as well and it's got ring plus RGB
software it control that you can use to
control them all finally we got a couple
Thermaltake pure plus 12 120 millimeter
fans here just find out the main
difference these are designed more for
radiators and they have the LEDs on the
central hub whereas the ring plus has
the LEDs around the ring is a three fan
kits the blades are not clear they're
sort of their sort of frosty frosted
blades and that's to allow the LED
illumination to shine through them other
than that got some rubber mounting on
the side sort of clean look and design
for fans and I think the RGB is really
the standout feature here but anyway
thank you
thermaltake I now have way more fans
than I had before you guys even notice
these boxes in the back these are these
are the really exciting ones so the guys
can't tell this is from nock to up so in
here we have noctua goodies nf a 12 X 25
6 six of them that's awesome
we also have these phantom adapters
since these fans are hundred and twenty
millimeter the naktu is like they're
really so good they can also opt for 440
millimeter fans they sent a couple of
these which allows you to easily mount
the 120 130 millimeter bracket and then
we've also got a couple CPU coolers here
the NHL 12s which is a horizontal style
air cooler and the NH L 9a a m4 which is
specifically designed for a m4 and this
is a low-profile cooler I really like
not to his packaging just
everything's laid out here and they got
you a nice thing a thermal paste and
they've got the little inline own low
noise adapter so if your fans making too
much noise and you can't control it
effectively with your motherboard or a
fan controller put that in line and
it'll slow down the fan speed and then
the coolers themselves are just like
this is this feels so heavy and dense
and like just premium I really like it
so it's got a am4 bracket on there since
this is a low profile cooler made for a
m4 it's got a little I believe it's a 92
millimeter fan on top and that's pretty
much all there is to it so I will need
to find a good home for that one perhaps
a mini ITX build or something that this
would be a good suitable solution for
then we got the NHL 12s and I think I
already know what I'm gonna be using
this for although I'm going to do
something with it
that I don't think noctua will like and
we'll see how you guys feel about it too
so this is intended to be a low profile
cooler but it's got a bit more thermal
mass a bit more size than the extremely
low profile and hl9
a that's right there comes the slim fan
that you can fit underneath the cooler
but you can't actually move that around
to the top if you want to depending on
how much vertical clearance you have as
well as potentially RAM clearance
configurations it just depends on your
motherboard layout so I think what I'm
actually gonna do is take this fan off
here and this is an NFA 12 X 15 that
they have on here just 15 millimeters
thick but I'm gonna ditch that and on a
stick one of my hundred and twenty
millimeter Corsair ll series RGB fans on
top and that's because these systems
thus cooling is gonna be the mini ITX
build that's for free Ness it's not
gonna get all that hot I don't need that
much cooling for it and I do want to
maintain the RGB aesthetic of the entire
build so that fan on top can be plugged
into the a m4 motherboard to run the fan
and then the LEDs on it I will route
over to the main system so that when the
main system is on all the lights will
turn on and everything but when the mini
system is just on by itself it doesn't
need any lights the fan will spin but
the lights won't go on that's gonna be
my air cooler or the mini ITX build on
the bottom of your tight oh yeah I got
all these eight 12 X 20 fives like best
best fan in the world
and now the moment you've all been
waiting for
or I've been waiting for at least I have
two of these boxes these are from alpha
cool and this is all the water cooling
parts for Riptide since there's two I'm
gonna start with just this one I think
these came all the way from Germany
there might be mystery things in here
all right is packed it's packed with
stuff in here Wow
I'm not not really sure where to begin
this let's start with something simple
this is named port bracket for alpha
cools existing CPU block I am using the
helix reservoir so we have a few inserts
for that which gives that sort of helix
interior view which looks pretty cool
I've decided there's so much stuff here
that I really just need to get it all
out of the box and then I'll try to at
least go down and point out what each
thing is that I'm aware of
this is CKC Cape Kelvin catcher which is
anti-corrosion fluid this appears to be
the same thing as far as I can tell
just making sure I've got plenty of it
to fill the loop alright I have two of
these this is the ice Bakker helix
reservoir black caps and a white helix
in the middle this is just a reservoir
and as mentioned I've got the blue
insert that I can pop in there if I
decide that blue will match our phone
into one white or one blue I have two of
these as well these are my GPU blocks
for the gtx 980ti listed as gtx 1080 on
here but this is the nexus GP x from
alpha cool and these are specifically
made for the asus strix version of the
card so there's the instruction manual
right there but the double check make
sure everything is as it should be here
but actually ethical said they they do
have new blocks that they just came out
with that are the more like acid ol
plexi that you can see through it
everything that are a little bit more
flashy but I actually kind of want to
embrace the the sort of industrial feel
for this build again I'm trying to make
it functional not just crazy high-end
water cooling but this quick look at the
block you can see there's big old heat
fins along the whole thing to provide
some Eden heat dissipation the
Loup therefore the actual GPU contact
partners also contact for the memory and
vrm so I'm excited about that
next are the radiators that I've got
three of them to 480 rads for four by
120 millimeter fans those are going to
go in the Front's where all of the fan
mounts already are and I did mount those
up with fans already I'm only going to
pull one of these out this is the
quarter that's 20 millimeter radiator
this is three by 140 and jeez it's just
that's incredibly beefy copper fins in
the middle of course so there's gonna be
an insane amount of cooling on this
which basically means I don't be able to
run the run the fans like almost off
June quarter connectors down there in
the ends for your fittings or whatever
else you're gonna connect up there to
complete the loop and a black finish we
have a bunch of fittings extensions
extenders these are all different
varieties different sizes so not going
to go through them all I have two pumps
since I'm doing two loops these are D
five pumps and these are separate from
the reservoir that I showed you earlier
but as you can see nice blacks leaving
on the back there and then various in
and out points depending on how I
actually want to configure the loop I
will need to figure out some proper
mounting brackets for this although
there is a kits that comes in the box
itself to help you out with that next we
have fittings and that's what's in this
white box is a bunch of these sets of
fittings here and there's more sets of
fittings in there I'm gonna need quite a
few fittings because I need fittings for
any point where a block needs a
connection points for example connection
points for all of these quick
disconnects that I've got here but these
are compression fittings I'm using soft
tubing and there's a quick look there
nice clean finish on them I like it you
can even choose what color or ring you
want we got red red turquoise and yellow
it's kind of an interesting add on there
I wonder if these have different
properties somehow I already mentioned
quick disconnects but I have a set of
eight of them here and again this is to
set it up so that my CPU can be removed
just the block itself I can use these to
easily disconnect from the loop and
these things are these things are pretty
pretty sturdy and they're also sort of
spring-loaded here so when you pop them
in and remove them they kind of pop out
like that which is which is fun but this
is
I'm actually probably most sighted
excited about these because these are
very highly praised and sought-after
quick disconnects from alpha cool people
use them a lot of different systems and
I think just practically speaking
especially if you guys watched the
Arctic Panther video where I had to
disassemble the whole thing and clean
out the blocks and everything
maintenance wise or any upgrades I want
to do or just getting into connect to
get at stuff that might be otherwise
blocked by hardline tubing I think I'm
gonna have a better long-term solution
here going with the soft tubing and the
quick disconnects this is sort of an
interesting product I wasn't expecting
to find it off a pool but I did and it's
something I need for the mini ITX build
at the bottom I have an interesting the
situation where I actually have two
about two slots but I can't use both of
them because of the CPU I'm using which
is going to be the 2400 G so I'm going
to need to use a single PCIe by 16 slot
on the mini ATX board to put an MDOT two
riser enough cool actually makes one
this one here and even comes with some
passive cooling to go on top of that too
this is our CPU block the ice block xpx
cpu and I do want to point out for
anyone who's going to bring this up in
the comments this is not the ideal block
to use for thread Ripper simply because
it's not designed specifically for
thread Ripper it'll get the job done
it'll cool it just fine and that is
again why I have this adapter kit for
tr4 it I might acid am for earlier this
is a thread Ripper adapter so you can
use the ice block xpx on a tr4 cpu mount
but there's a decent chance that I might
swap this out in the future again thanks
to the quick disconnects I can do that
without needing to completely
disassemble the loop so this will work
for now and of course
gotta have that adapter to make sure I
can mount it on my cpu but guys that's
gonna do it for this video so of course
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you enjoyed it and subscribe because
I've got the riptides builds coming and
I'm gonna get to work on that like as
soon as possible also if you're
interested I have merchandise shirts
like this one as well as mugs pint
glasses bottle openers and you can find
those on my store down in the video's
description
and of course if you have any friends
who are into PC building or liquid
cooling and you want to share my channel
or this video with them as well that
would be much appreciated
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
