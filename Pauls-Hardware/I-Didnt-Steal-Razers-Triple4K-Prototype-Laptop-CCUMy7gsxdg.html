keverage first big thanks to my sponsors
for this event gigabytes ocz a Toshiba
company as well as deep cool but right
Razer right now and you guys maybe have
already seen this it's project Valery
and this is razor's concept project for
a pretty cool game and laptop with a lot
of high-end hardware in it and three 4k
monitors that are all connected up to it
at the same time the monitors themselves
actually are motorized or they will be
motorized in the final version so all
you have to do is probably press a
button somewhere and they'll expand and
slide out they don't fold it or anything
they actually slide out from the sides
that gives you the benefit of course of
having tons and tons of screen real
estate in a portable package but it also
gives you the benefit of having them
slide out evenly and being properly
spaced so you don't have to do any
adjustments or configuration to that
kind of thing which is very common unit
setting up like a 3 monitor desktop
display as far as hardware right now it
is based on the razor blade Pro model so
we can assume it's got a high-end mobile
sixth or seventh generation intel core
processor the graphics card it's running
on right now is a GTX 1080 and this
model we're looking at right here is
actually a functional prototype but out
in the front they're showing off one
that's kitted out with a bit more the
finishing touches that they wanted to
put on there so for example it has RGB
lighting that goes along under each of
the monitors that come out on the side
just a little bit of down firing
lighting because you know RGB everything
it's still popular people still like it
it's also got some vents on the back
that open up to prevent some some hot
air I'm not sure whether that's for the
monitors themselves or for the hardware
inside but again they're still working
on this and they're probably a ways off
from actually bringing anything to
market so they're asking the fans at
home to give some feedback the feedback
so far has been incredibly positive and
there's tons of options for this in the
future so for example right now it's on
a 1080 a 1080 pushing 3 4k displays
probably not going to be quite enough
power so you know maybe they'll do a
dual GPU version in the future maybe if
a 1080 Ti ever launches or an 1100
series card for example comes out they
might integrate something like that to
give yourself a little bit more
our they could also take this concept
though and integrate it into a different
product so for example you have a razor
blade a smaller like a 14-inch laptop
you could take maybe a single screen and
pop it on there and just have one slide
out to the side for something like
productivity for people who like to do
twitch streaming for example and take a
gaming laptop on the go and have a
secondary screen that's available so you
can have your twitch chat and all that
good stuff up on their incredibly
convenience and transporting a monitor
can be a pain in the ass we've had
several break on us and the little
portable ones there convenience but it's
not going to line itself up properly for
gaming or that kind of thing anyway I
think this is a really cool product
again it's a project Valkyrie and not
Valkyrie project Valerie and we have no
idea when it's coming out or anything
like that a couple or one last thing to
note this entire thing when collapsed
you can still use a single 4k display so
that's an option and altogether right
now with the different models of it that
they've been working on it's only coming
in about 10 to 12 pounds which is a
little on the heavy side for like an
ultra portable but when you compare it
to like a full-size desktop replacement
laptop that's about how much they weigh
and this one has two extra 4k screens so
I'm pretty impressed let me know if you
guys are impressed too I hit the thumbs
up on this video of course if you
enjoyed it and big thanks again to my
sponsors Toshiba deep cool as well as
gigabyte thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
