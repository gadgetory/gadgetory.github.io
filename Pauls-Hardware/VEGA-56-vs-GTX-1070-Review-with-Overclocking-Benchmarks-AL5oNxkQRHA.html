welcome to my first ever radeon RX vega
review AMD's new GPU line it launches
today with the Vegas 64 and the soon to
be available they get 56 I'm going to be
focusing on the Vega 56 today which is
retailing for $399 and is intended to
compete with nvidia gtx 1070 under the
vega 64 as well which is going to retail
for $499 for the standard version at
least it looks like this what i have
here is actually the brushed metal
finished limited edition version that
you can get if you purchase a Radeon
pack but I will put links to the Radeon
packs as well as the individual cards in
the description once they become
available and another day or two I'm
going to be coming back with a video
follow-up on the Vegas 64 benchmarking
numbers for today that I'm going to be
focusing on the Vegas 56 versus the
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770 so let's get
right into the testing set up my test
bench is composed of an Intel Core i7
7700 cave cpu running at 4.8 gigahertz
the motherboard is a gigabyte z 270
horas gaming 5 the water cooler is a
corsair h1 sent to under an 18
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
for memory I have a 2 by 8 gig kit 16
gig solo of Kingston HyperX predator
ddr4 running at 3200 speed cast latency
16 in dual channel mode for storage I'm
a Windows 10 operating system on an
Intel 600 P 512 gigabyte nvme SSD games
of video files are on an external san
difficult or to one terabyte data SSD
connected to a USB 3.0 not only for
power I've of course are HX 1000 I 1000
watt 80 plus platinum power supply and
it's all on an open testbed so for
comparison I have the galaxy gtx 1070
EXO c sniper and this is a manufacturer
overclocked third-party reference design
version of the gtx 1070 this is the
ultimate benchmarking question when you
have a new graphics card like the vega
56 what should i compare it to Andy of
course would prefer that I compare it to
the gtx 1070 founders edition but that's
running at stock frequencies and stock
GP runs at about 18 50 megahertz peak 17
50 megahertz stable under gaming load
but just seems a little bit slow given
how well the 1070 actually overclocks
and how many third-party designs are on
the market that you can buy that already
come pre overclocked so I chose the
Galax gtx 1070 xoc sniper for this
reason it has a healthy manufacturer
overclock it takes just shy of 2,000 and
was running at about 1962 megahertz
under load given that the 1070 is out
for over a year already I think this
modest concession to the third-party
versions that are available is fair but
feel free to use the comment section
down below to tell me if you disagree as
always the GPU driver I'm using is the
latest from video version three eight
four nine four and I have pressed
provided drivers for the Vega cards I'm
using hardware info 64 and the AMD
Radeon settings utility to monitor
statistics ambi also delivered a new
driver and software build on Saturday
with some updates for overclocking
supports and although we weren't
supposed to use that build for
comparison testing actually got some
pretty solid results with it so I have
included them too now with early
hardware and software monitoring can be
touchy so here's how I overclocked with
Radeon setting using the wot man utility
under global settings manually entering
the frequency just wasn't working it
also used the percentage slider I
started with a 10 percent overclock that
I eventually dialed back to 9 percent to
due to some instability I maxed out the
voltage where possible I bumped up the
eight gigs of HP into memory from 800 to
900 megahertz frequency I set a much
more aggressive fan curve maxing out at
4500 rpm and I set the power limits plus
50 percent I'm not completely sure what
frequency I was hitting again due to
quirks with early software and numbers
showing up that pretty positive weren't
actually accurate but I think the GPU is
operating in the 1662 1680 megahertz
range topping out at just over 1700 I
did encounter some instability as well
while I was going through these
benchmark numbers but I've still decided
to include them because they did improve
my performance by about five to ten
percent when it was working and I wanted
to give at least a starting out idea for
how performance might improve with Vegas
56 when third-party cards with better
cooling options arrived with all that
said here are my benchmarks
so guys I know I didn't talk you through
the benchmarks this time but I think I
will do that for the next video when I
cover Vegas 64 honestly though these
were some of the closest numbers I've
seen with two similarly priced graphics
cards generally speaking the 1078 kind
of shoots the gap between a stock and an
overclocked Vega 56 which would make
them very competitive at the same price
there's a bit more to the story though
starting out with Tower draw now I
measure power draw at the wall I got an
average while gaming with 3d mark and I
also did the peak power draw across all
the testing that I did Vega at 56
overclocked got pretty power-hungry
hitting as much as 487 Watts max power
draw that is while overclocked though
now Vega is a higher TDP graphics card
though with two eight pin PCI Express
power connectors and varying board power
settings depending on whether or not
it's water-cooled what power profile
you're using and if you switch to the
secondary v bios which is tuned
specifically for lower power usage I ran
my Vega 56 with the main v bios and the
turbo profile because I'm more
interested in performance and efficiency
right now that means I'm using 190 watt
power profile but all of these values
kind of go out the window when you start
overclocking as you can see from my
average in peak power draw numbers the
ramp up is pretty significant when you
overclock
I haven't tested these lower power
settings but my impression was that Vega
can be very power efficient as a GPU
just not while running it to frequencies
that also produce good benchmark results
when you compare it to Nvidia as for
temperatures both of these cards got
pretty warm hitting 80 degrees or more
on the GPU while benchmarking the
temperature increase while overclocking
the Vega 56 might seem minimal here but
remember that I was also running the
fans at close to max meaning that they
were also pretty loud at the same time
speaking of loud though unfortunately I
didn't have time to run official sound
meter testing for this video but
anecdotally I can tell you that with the
base
turbo setting the fan noise for the
Vegas 56 was just fine not quiet but
well within acceptable noise levels for
gaming
when overclocking however well a blower
of style fan running at 4500 rpm might
as well be a small vacuum let's just put
that way
that's for frequencies again there was
some weirdness with the monitoring
software but my card was able to hit the
same frequency from what I could tell as
the Vega 64 liquid-cooled
when overclocking which is supposed to
be about 16 77 megahertz but my card was
at least up in that range when not
overclocked it was pretty stable as far
as I could tell at 1590 which is the
reference speed so overall now that Vega
is finally here is it's living up to the
hype I would say not really but that's
mostly because there was too much hype
and it was drawn out over way too long a
period of time it's also totally fair to
point out that AMD is competing with
Nvidia cards from last year the GTX 1080
and 1070 launched at May 27th and June
10th 2016 respectively and these cards
watching 15 months later are competitive
when it comes to performance and pricing
but not quite so much when you also
consider power draw and launch timing I
also noted that the 1% and 0.1% lows
weren't looking quite as good for Vega
in my testing it did improve when
overclocked but hopefully those numbers
will also smooth out as we see some
driver updates as the drivers we can
also assume are pretty early at this
point on the plus side though it is very
good at least to show that the Vega 56
is very competitive with the gtx 1070 at
all resolutions so if power draw is less
of a concern for you and it's a very
viable option even more so when you look
at the complete picture which includes
not just your GPU and your computer but
also monitors as freesync monitors are
just way more affordable than in videos
g-sync alternatives often buy one
hundred four hundred dollars or more if
you're buying a GPU and a variable
refresh rate monitor the precinct option
what they get is just a much better
price to performance choice if we're
really looking at the whole picture
though we have to also include
cryptocurrency mining and that could
very well destroy any hope that the
common gamer has for getting one of
these GPUs at the actual retail price
there's still a lot more to be said and
question when it comes to this Vega
launch I'm sure in the next few days and
weeks but for now I'm going to cut this
one off and continue my work in the Vega
64 benchmarks if you guys have any
comments or suggestions for that
coverage please leave those in the

my channel and don't forget to turn on
those notifications too if you don't
want to miss when I post in the next
