click the link in the description for
more information what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware this is arctic
panther build longer forbore and if
everything goes according to plan this
is gonna be the final build log in this
series of course I might do more with
the system down the line and I'm gonna
do another follow-up video with some
actual testing and performance and
temperature numbers but for today I just
have a short list but an important list
of final things to take care of with
this build before I can do the final
fill and give you guys hopefully some
sweet sweet b-roll porn well I actually
fill up this unit with this primo chill
view opaque fluid with the magic inside
that makes it look all squishy and gives
it some fancy texture beyond filling of
course though I have a couple other
major important things to take care of
one of course it's going to be the cable
training which I've done a tad bit of
right now with some twist ties I don't
have any proper cable combs so I'm gonna
be using some at home ghetto methods I
have some twist ties on there right now
with just the initial shape that they
should be in I might actually do some
fishing line method on that as well but
we'll see how things go cuz I'm limited
on space finally one major problem is
that as I filled up my reservoir I
realized at the top of it which I'm not
able to tighten down all the way and
still have my outlets pointing back
which is where they need to be to get my
fill port lined up it's leaking a little
bit so for that just gonna add some PTFE
tape and hopefully that will seal the
leak let's get started I actually had
quite a few people ask me how I'm
planning to drain this with the drain
here at the bottom middle of the case
well since I know I'm going to have the
system over in the corner my plan the
entire time has been to sort of position
it right here on the edge of the desk so
that I can just drain it straight down
so I get a bucket in there my dilemma
right now is that this is the same fill
drain part on the bottom as the
filtering port on the top I discovered
in the previous video that that is
actually not
gee 1/4 that's a much wider gap right
there I believe that it might be like a
half inch or something like that not
entirely sure but I am going to use an
old piece of tubing I'm just going to
take the cap off and kind of fit it on
under there so it can drain out and then
get this water out of here yeah that's
that's pretty good oh but I barely got
it threaded on there so it's there and
now top open to a lot air in should be
I'll just turn the knob and we should
just get a dream we have definite
success for the main reservoir over here
beyond that lots of spray but we're
actually getting a siphon effect for the
rest of the loop here and it's even
pulling it was pulling some water up and
through the radiator and out through the
loop so we're not getting a full drain I
wasn't expecting that but we did get
most of the main chamber out of there
it's mainly a few areas of the loop that
have some water stuck in them it doesn't
want to come out our flow indicator here
of course being a major issue as well as
the kind of bump behind that radiator up
here I've got most of the liquid out of
the graphics cards as far as I can tell
but yeah introducing an air inlet up in
this upper length here is really what's
what probably solved most of this but
also require a pretty major redesign of
the loop so for now we will do our best
to get as much of it out of there as we
can so our flow indicator here is is
where we have most of the fluid it's
really not that much it's very small not
this trap right there but that's
probably where and I could get it out of
there but I really should move on at
this point and I don't think it's going
to be a huge deal
and attempting to use the fishing line I
point out that there are proper ways of
doing this and I have no idea what I'm
doing right now this needle might
actually work for me it's a it's a
leather working needle so the tip is
pretty blunt so I shouldn't have to
worry about poking through wires or
anything I just needed a better way to
actually manipulate my fishing line here
and possibly give myself a shot at
threading these cables
so I have given up I made a brief
attempt at the cable threading thing I
might attack that again with a power
supply that I have full access to the
cables too but since these cables
already halfway installed go the old
school get our method of cable training
which is basically to use twist ties
because they are flexible and somewhat
rigid because there's a wire inside you
can wrap them around kind of position
the cables where you want them to be and
all I'm really caring about is the part
of the cable that's poking out there and
the front that's visible so that's all
I'm training up right here everything
else as far as excess cable stuff that's
not as long as it should be
dummy wires it's gonna be pushed back
here and hopefully can leave these twist
ties on for a few days maybe a week
we'll see how long pull them off and the
cable should stay where they where I
told them to be stay stay
it's another issue of me attempting to
overcome some of the aesthetic fails of
the original arctic panther builds and
this group of cables here was always a
challenge for me that we're all I'm a it
always made it really tough to get the
reverse side panel on and everything so
I don't I don't think I can make this
functional but I'm hoping I can do a
little bit more of cinching down and
stuff to at least be able to put that
side panel on without too much trouble I
can't forget the LED strip I have a
single RGB strip here I'm gonna go it's
gonna kind of curve up the edge here and
I've already brought the showed that in
the last video how I brought the lead
for it over here just gonna go around
the bottom I'm gonna fix it with some
glue gun glue with my super ghetto glue
gun this does have some adhesive on the
bottom that the adhesive the 3m adhesive
that comes on LED strips like this is
notoriously unreliable so we're gonna
switch that out so make sure I'm
plugging this end in correctly
all right I'm gonna go without the glue
gun done because honestly I might need
to I might want to reposition this a
little bit let's we light it up and see
how it looks it's also a chance that I
might add an extension to this LED and
bring it up over here as well right now
that is connected to the RGB logo here
on the sli bridge and then that strip
across the bottom I'm pretty sure I
could add the top one as well because
I'm out of our GB headers on the
motherboard now we're gonna fill it
again
main main issue for me right now is
making sure there's nothing coming out
around the edge of this which we appear
to be okay with thank God for that
PT GT I guess moving on to a very
important moment which is actually
powering on the system with the loop
with its own power supply I've been
running the pump off of an external
power supply um out just to make sure if
there's a leak we don't lose any
components in there so yeah I got the
cap on with the ptg wrap on there it
does appear to be holding water no leaks
come in there
so let's let's go oh wait oh look we
have standby power so SLI bridge and the
RGB strip down here are plugged in the
same but the colors aren't the same the
SLI bridge here and the RGB strip aren't
syncing up that means two of them are
probably swapped ASIS or actually I
think this comes with cable mod LED
strips a little adapter and this will
allow me to theoretically switch over
all right so it's flip flop the G in R
the R and the B or whatever was flipped
now we're getting the same color here as
we are an RGB strip down at the bottom
so that's pretty cool
rest of the RGB LEDs are gonna be
controlled by the software and I need to
get that installed and up and running of
course but for now I think work to the
point where we can actually do the fill
with this stuff from primo chill the
view coolant and actually pretty excited
to get this installed and see how it all
looks
that's really cool
so guys my fluid has turned blue that's
right view is now blue and I have to
point out here that I'm using some parts
that were used in the previous arc
Panther build and that this stuff that
primo Jill sent me is not ready for
public consumption yet this is not the
stuff that they're going to be selling
when it's finally done
and I imagine white might be a little
bit tougher to handle than maybe some of
the other pastel colors that they might
go with however chemicals being
difficult to handle when you're dealing
with the loop inside a computer with
different temperatures and all that I am
not at all surprised that there was some
color shift although it did happen
fairly quickly overnight we have now a
sort of nice ice blue color in there
although if you can tell compared to the
original fluid which is still fairly
white since I do have some leftovers but
I do think it is about time to call it
quits for arctic panther build block
number four and although there are some
aesthetic quibbles still left to be
worked out the actual build is complete
and functionally everything is working
even if aesthetically it's not all quite
exactly where I want it to be I have
started to remove some of the ties that
I used for the cable training over here
and they're mostly staying where they
should I'll probably remove some more of
those after a few more days have gone by
and I do some finishing touches shifting
stuff into place there's a couple other
things I might still do but I think for
now I'm gonna leave you guys with the
montage of the system as is because
since I do have our GB LEDs in there and
I have gotten the operating system
installed and the AC source software up
and running I've also done at least some
BIOS adjustments for the fing speed and
that kind of thing everything's working
really good so so that's good I might
figure out something to do with the
fluid at a later date if you guys have
any suggestions for me leave those in
the comments as you can tell it just got
nice and quiet since the fans and stuff
kicked into gear and I am getting some
nice texture out of that view
fluid so I will say that even running
overnight it's still staying nice and
and texture II and soapy or whatever you
want to call it in there so that's cool
it is getting the job done when it comes
to the looks department just wish it was
all white because then I would have a
little bit more flexibility when it
comes to the lights in here the lights
are looking pretty good when I have like
blue and pink in but I'm talking too
much already so guys don't forget that
the thumbs up button on your way out if
you enjoyed this video share it with
your friends if you think they might
enjoy it too and subscribe to my channel
because I got more stuff coming on this
although the build part is complete for
now here is a montage of the final
Arctic Panther probably
