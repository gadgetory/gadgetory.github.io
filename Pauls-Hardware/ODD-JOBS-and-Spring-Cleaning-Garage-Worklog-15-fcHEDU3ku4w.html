more hey guys I'm welcome to paul's
hardware it is spring time and of course
spring time is that magical time of the
year when young man's fancy turns to
luck but I'm married so instead I'm
going to clean so just so you guys know
it fronts just going to be doing some
hard work today and some cleaning at
some other projects too so I'll take you
along for the ride I hope you enjoy and
to make sure that things are even more
effectively done yep Jo Jo is gonna help
me clean
are you excited Jo tell me there was
gonna be pie Oh we'll get pilot
continuing my Odyssey of unboxings and
stuff of lighting equipments add two
more LED lights these are Dre cast LEDs
and we're going to get them out of the
box and installed on to the RC stands
bag pouch
Olek more barn doors it has it has a gel
in there just a diffusion gel right now
and these are just little stoppers on
the side you can pop up and say keep the
junk from sliding out they're very light
slightly well you could put batteries
here yes it's got this adapter so you
can use these 7.2 volt batteries it's
it's a standard type of battery and that
just it's just so you can make them
portable I'm mostly gonna be using and
plugged in because it's got AC power to
what happen pop you know it's fun
because these lightbulbs
these are fluorescents these came with
the lighting kit and I have like none of
them these don't these haven't really
burned up these have done a really good
job and not burned up and the first
thing I did
removing one here is just dropped it on
the granite top I feel horrible another
day with honor
hey at least the dogs are at the vet
sure they good timing for the dogs to be
at the vet this is the original cowboy
studio lighting kit that I got when I
first started doing YouTube videos on my
channel from my apartment many years ago
and it is just disintegrating this parts
of it that is still perfectly fine like
this is fine the actual base unit for
all the light bulbs is fine but this is
the diffusion thing it's just
disintegrating this wasn't exactly high
quality fabric or anything like that
tables looking much cleaner already we
are proceeding with disassembling the
CES 2020 18 built this is the build that
we brought to CES to Joe edited on and
we're done with it
gonna take it apart we've now come to
the most interesting part of the day Joe
is proceeding with the arrangements and
sorting of the screws yes I have lots of
screws and now they're sorted thank you
Joe actually I still have to sort these
small project to you to take led mount
it up here in the corner so we can use
it kind of as a hair light and I wanted
to back here that way I can angle it
down so this area where we're sitting
when we what I'm saying it's the best
can do it stuff but else is so I can
turn it to angle it down towards the
main work table over here so hey I
discovered this like I don't know how
long ago I bought these I went and I
bought several of these things and these
are these can be used to mount this too
and then have a bunch of adapters here
so four quarter inch or 8 inch screws
which are kind of the standard mounting
screws that you have with photography
equipment and that kind of thing and I
have several adapters of this so you
should be able to take this combine it
with either like a ball head so I can
mount that to that and just have it
mounted on the ball head so you can
loosen that and angle it around or I've
got this little magic arm here and that
could also be used in the same way so
we'll see what which works best
field trip time we are headed over to
Lowe's we were thinking about Home Depot
but Lowe's is straight over here and I
have a list of things that we need to
get there including a grubbing hoe if
you guys don't know what a grubbing hoe
is just stay tuned
then we gave high pop our game
probably the most important thing on my
list make sure you have a working carbon
monoxide alarm in your home but Joe over
here has been handling the screws so got
3/8 inch screws we're going for ones
that will hopefully be able to thread
through a 2x4 and then still give us
some threading on the outside so we got
a 2-inch a few two-inch ones and we got
some two and a half inch ones there too
and we brought along my ball head here
so I should double-check and make sure
the threading was appropriate for that
and it is also some nuts because you
gotta have nuts and washers Jesus Christ
Stonebreaker no ha found his hope this
is a spike on the end
we're investigating wheelbarrows we need
a wheelbarrow to go along with the
grubbing hoe down there wheelbarrows are
now DIY build your own wheelbarrow you
get to choose from your selection of
wheelbarrow tubs and then you get a the
handles and you get the box of gear and
that goes along with it so which tub
which tub looks best Joe the red the red
tub
that's the trooper six cubic feet
straight loop handle wood that's this
one here there's a trooper ergo yeah
that sounds good on second thought we're
not gonna get the red one we're getting
the green one thirty bucks cheaper worry
Joe I got this I'm telling this off you
got it cool
yeah I guess that's why people invest in
the ezf because this this is a not easy
up this is a hard up I think
damn you nature damn you
so part of criteria working with paws
and only next construction work perfect
45-degree cut awesome it's 46 provides
46 degrees
getting sawdust on the raisin box yeah
it's okay
something to make your life easier creel
pre-drill the holes and I have like the
point sticking out like that
that way when you're like trying to like
find a hole can't lie got yourself is
like get stuck in the way then like
there you go
since we couldn't like have much of a
clearance up here you had to do this
thing that way that's more attaching
secured so it'll be easier to move if I
ever have to as well yeah so now I got
to do this gap here and we're good to go
put your dust all over your expensive
stuff sorry we covered it and put a
towel down man there you go
impact feel that's the best that's
secure it's redwood to Redwood not too
tight boy there you go there's pretty
secure
cool nice spin it rotate it beautiful
next time I'm pulsar we're all cable
manages all this mess up here it's kind
of guys it's coming soon but not yet
new extra-long powerstrips this is gonna
go over here placing all of my cables on
the ground in amounts it's underneath
gosh that looks horrible
this is a rare angle that we shoot here
it pulls hard anyone's wondering about
the hole in the drywall over there that
was the one time that hero got locked in
the garage
alright guys the Sun is going down on
Sunday and I've been working this
weekend Joe is here of course on Friday
but I've gotten more stuff done so let's
take stock real quick before I end
today's video I got the EZ up up this
isn't really an easy up but I actually
completely forgot this was a screened-in
thing but it's good to have out here now
that we've got some shade so it can work
since it's been getting hotter
look I built a wheelbarrow very excited
that I built a wheelbarrow I didn't know
they came in DIY kits these days but it
wasn't too difficult to put together and
now I can dig stuff and put it in it and
cart it around yay
moving into the garage though I have to
first point out this big pile of boxes
this is what I'm gonna finish doing this
evening I still have work to do these
are all boxes that are left over from
stuff that's arrived recently so I'm
going to finish the video by Darren
tearing all those down so I can put them
out with the recycling look my main work
table is all cleared off got the mob mat
set up there I have vacuumed sort of
cleaned the floor so I've gotten a lot
of the dog care and stuff off of that
which is really nice tables pretty clean
but look at the lack of cable clutter
that's on the ground down here now with
the under mounted power strip right
there I can just plug stuff in as needed
and not need to have that's power strip
down there I rarely show this corner of
the garage because it's really not very
tidy and it's not finished up here and
there's still lots of work to be done
but I didn't want to at least point out
that I wall-mounted the power strip that
was also hanging out down here that had
a bunch of stuff attached to it that was
also a tripping hazard and sucked to
have there so this corner is not exactly
where I wanted it I wanted to wall mount
this thing too it didn't quite get there
but I'll do that in the future
and look at that all the boxes are
cleaned broken down I even got them up
for the recycling and it's now Monday
and look at that we got more work to do
Joe's back so we're gonna have to work
