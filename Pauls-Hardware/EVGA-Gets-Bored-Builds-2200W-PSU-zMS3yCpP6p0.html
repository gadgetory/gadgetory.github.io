Nevada is brought to you by coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool hi
guys I'm over at EVGA now and they have
their board I'll be honest they're bored
they don't have a new graphics cards so
let's see what they come up with all
right let's start out with this device
right below me this is the SC 15 which
is a laptop you probably have seen
before
because it's already an existing EVGA
product however look at that max Q max Q
is of course certification that you get
from Nvidia that says your gaming laptop
is super awesome which means that it can
be within within a certain amount of
noise generation threshold a certain
size and a certain level of power so you
gotta have a gtx 1070 or 1080 in there
for that and for the SC 15 it hasn't
have been updated with a gtx 1070 other
than that it's pretty much the same
design aluminum chassis very powerful
system that they have going on in there
and they're just in a little Wolfenstein
demo with that it's also got the nice
brushed aluminum top cover there as well
it's a really nice laptop so if anyone's
looking for a thin portable and actually
good to game on laptop check out the SSC
50 max cubes now when I said EVGA is
board this is this is kind of what I
meant look look what they've come up
with here in the interim between that
graphics cards watch launches for Nvidia
they have this color coded sets of
plastic pieces which are plastic and
basically you can use these with a
closed loop cooler since EVGA does make
those and you can use it to cable manage
your tubes so there's an example of a
few of these installed and just allows
you to more precision route your tubing
to you know leave more open space or
perhaps just give yourself a more
colorful looking interior of your case
since obviously they are available in a
wide variety of colors we're expecting
these to launch in the second quarter of
2018 so fairly soon no word on pricing
and they don't actually have an official
name for these yet either so you guys
have any good ideas for what EVGA should
call these little things then leave a
comment in the comment section down
below and let them know what you think
they can be used individually one at a
time they're 90 degree bends or you can
use this little
piece in the middle to sort of snap a
couple of them together so if you have
two tubes that's would naturally be next
to each other you can you can pair them
up make them a couple for later here's
the EVGA z10 which is a mechanical
gaming keyboard it's got Cherry MX brown
switches and it looks familiar that's
because we first talked about this one
year ago at CES 2017 and we also showed
it at Computex 2017 but now it's
actually just about the finalized
version ready for launch so it comes
with a detachable wrist rest which
slides on via the front just just like I
did I have look I even did that with one
hand that's always impressive beyond
that you've got a full 10 key full
keyboard layouts there's a couple of
macro keys over on the left side that
you can assign it does have a button up
there for gaming that will disable the
windows button so you don't actually hit
that while you're playing speaking of
which the windows buttons on the right
side not over here they got a function
button over there so you can access some
additional function controls in there on
the top right I've got some media
controls there's a volume and a dimmer
slider at the top great and the top left
respectively and then right there at the
dead centre is a little display LED
readout display and this will actually
allow you to display stuff from a VGA is
precision X utilities so if you're
playing a video game
and you don't necessarily want to use
the on-screen overlay in order to main
monitor stuff like your GPU temperature
or your frame rate or that kind of thing
you can just set up via precision X and
display that information down on a
screen and get more info about how your
system is performing as you're playing
games there's also a EVGA utility a bit
of software that they have been
developing for this and that will allow
you to configure macros as well as
actually switch around some keystrokes
and that kind of thing you can add it
repeat delay and setup the on-screen
display to be one way or another as well
as configuring the dimmer and volume
sliders so you can manipulate those as
well finally a really a feature that I
really like about this keyboard is it
has passed through USB ports in fact two
of them one on the left side and one on
the right side
and that's just that's just a feature
that I really like to have on a keyboard
so here it is the z10 and in case you're
wondering this is actually going to
launch this year in q1 so within the
next couple months we should expect it
and I asked for a price it's not
finalized so it might change but we're
looking at probably in the hundreds 120
dollar range I just to point out EVGA
does have some graphics cards here the
kingpin hydro copper the kingpin 1080 TI
really nice graphics cards but let's be
honest even out for a website you guys
have probably already familiar with
those they do have a couple new power
supply as though more practically
speaking here's the 1000 P Q this is an
80 plus Platinum rated power supply 1000
watts and it's going to be a little bit
more affordable than their existing
platinum series of power supplies that
is mainly due to the fact that they've
gone with the partially modular designs
that does have a couple six cables in
here 24 pin motherboard power connector
and that allows them to keep the price
down a little bit not a hundred percent
sure what the price is going to be on
this one but should be coming in the
first half of 2018
now here's the big boy and this was the
thing that kind of stood out to me the
most when when I was getting the tour
here this is the EVGA supernova 2200 p2
2200 means this is a 2200 watt power
supply now this means that if you're
located in the United States you cannot
plug this virus plot in to a normal
outlet it doesn't even have the normal
type of plug there at the bottom because
it needs to be able to support a higher
amount of power higher amperage actually
running through that in fact this power
supply is laid out with a single 12 volt
rail power chart on the side shows 180
3.3 amps on the 12 volt rail on this
unit it is 80 plus platinum rated and it
can deliver 2200 watts of power now if
you're wondering who's going to be
interested in this let's be honest
probably people who are using it for GPU
mining because practically speaking for
your typical single or 2 card graphics
star configuration this is way way way
overkill but EVGA did see some increased
interest over the past year and really a
high wattage power supply so they've
decided to work on the 2200 p2 again no
launch date available for this one
crisis also
up in the air but I'm expecting it to be
over $500 which it's just that's just so
much you got to pay for a power supply
it has this much power available I'm not
sure what the length is but it looks
like it's probably around 300
millimeters so you're probably gonna
need to make sure you have a case that's
large enough to fit this if you're
bothering to use a case at all let's
face it that GPU miners don't always
bother with cases but it's got a large
hundred and forty millimeter fan on
there and it is of course fully modular
a big big fat on/off switch that just
just feels really nice and so there's a
quick look at the modular plugs you can
you can you can attach many many
graphics cards to this thing and it
probably wouldn't even break a sweat
what will break a sweat is probably the
plug that you plug it into because if
you're in the u.s. you're going to need
to plug this into a 220 connection to
your circuit breakers such as the type
of plug that you would need for maybe an
oven or an air conditioner this will
draw too much power to plug into a
standard 120 volt plug so do bear that
in mind if you're planning on actually
purchasing this power supply but guys
that's gonna wrap it up for my coverage
here at the EVGA suite at the Bellagio
it's a lovely place and I got a nice
view actually of the Bellagio fountain
going up a little while ago which I
thought was super nice other guys if you
enjoyed the video hit the thumbs up
button at first and a big thank you
again to my sponsors for CES 2018 deep
cool enter match Coolermaster and those
cheesy sushi but thanks again for
watching guys hit the thumbs-up button
on your way out
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
