don't think anyone's that bad I mean
look I'm even going to turn it off right
now so I can talk to you guys and the
sounds will be a little bit better
the trick is you got to get a fan gotta
have a fan blowing and then you got to
have like sandals to go to wear sandals
and it helps to just like lounge around
them on the couch all the time - right
here
it feels legging
I'll see it turned off AC and now
there's a train rolling by but hey guys
and welcome to false hardware this is my
video for a hot summer weekend because I
am spending the entire weekend
benchmarking and it's hot that's why I'm
in the dining room yet again and I
promised my wife that once the Red River
benchmarking is all done with I will be
relinquishes the dining room table back
to her so we can use it for normal stuff
again like making home lead of booties
the Red River benchmarking is ongoing
though and that's pretty much all I can
tell you that's my system right there
monitors off because I can't share any
benchmarks quite yet but to go along
with the benchmarking through dripper I
thought hey I should probably compare it
and I think I should compare it against
the 7900 X so this is going to be
project one of two hopefully for this
videos
setting up the second testbed to compare
against the Red River and then also I'm
hopefully going to be installing if my
wife comes home with them some sit-stand
desks in our main computer room this
system by the way is a system that I
built in my accidental computer build
and I've been using this is my main
editing system in the computer room so
all my pulse Arbour videos that you guys
have been watching over the past few
weeks are all rendered on this system
and I built it because I wanted to use
that 7900 X and I wanted to because I
just wanted to use it like I hate when I
get things in and I don't use them so
it's been being used it's doing a good
job seven nine hundred X it's a thousand
dollar processor that's ten cores and
twenty threads and I just had to running
it stock but it's been staying cool
enough with my master air maker for
right here it's only been hidden maybe
the mid to low 80s when I'm rendering so
so not too bad although again haven't
really done any overclocking with it so
we'll see what happens once I move on to
that but I need to get that 70 100 X out
of here because I can't really use this
system this system has too much stuff
going on with it to test against thread
Ripper I need a more clean system and
for that I will be using this system
right here this system has the MSI X to
99 gaming m7 ack has a very clean
Windows installation on it and it has
the exact same memory kits that I have
on the threader per system over there
g.skill 4 by 8 gig kit so VR for 3200
cast latency 14 so mission one is pretty
straightforward here
just going to get on with it and swap
out these CPUs like nothing ever
happened
so going to postpone a computer room
upgrade project assist and desks we'll
get back to that at a later date today
we're going to go get some wood because
here's a coma htpc project is still sort
of in the works it is functional but
it's still just sitting kind of on top
of the subwoofer in the third music you
guys are called HTPC though it's still
just kind of sitting on top of the
subwoofer in the living room so I want
to wall mount that and I have an idea of
how to do that so we're going to place
called tool peak lumber may might be
totally pica I will figure it out how to
pronounce it when we get there and we're
going to see what kind of live-edge wood
slabs they have and then I also brought
the dogs because we didn't want to leave
them at home and my wife here too
so much wood there's this is the most
what I've ever seen anyway weird too
because we're like out in the kind of
desert in California so like it's not a
lot of actual trees or anything
I'm going to ask your fitness of no let
it slip it's on the heavy side okay yeah
it's this is an engineered cookie this
is an engineered cooking is it empty
inside
like an airplane wing and these are the
vine trimmings from a vineyard this is
what they would normally throw away and
we reproduce it as a serving trick
really cleaned it up it weighs a pound
Wow serve drinks on this yeah it's one
of a kind people think you're really
buff UK and the drinks and this big old
flood of wood it's rolling this tool -
Lee - Lee Valley lumber it timber timber
boom - Mike timber wolf
timber so - Lee peak tendr√° was an
absolutely fascinating place at first
we're driving there it's like where are
they going to get wood from we're kind
of driving through the California desert
but when we got there we met Rob he was
the owner operator as well as his
awesome boxer dog who's named with Lily
and he showed us around the place
basically they give reclaimed wood from
all over California all over the place
he said any time that they're digging up
trees or anything like that
he will reach out and try to get a hold
of whatever it is that they're pulling
out of the ground have a transporter to
him and they has a bunch of specialized
machinery set up he showed us for
instance a computer-controlled
contraption for basically milling wood I
don't know I'm sure I'm missing a lot of
the details here but a really
fascinating operation that they had up
there as well as a really wide range of
live edge slabs which is what I was
looking for when we went there so he
showed us a bunch of those he advised
that we get kiln dried ones to make sure
that any bugs or critters that might be
inside them are dead so we did find a
piece of wood
so mission was successful overall we
found a piece of wood and it was a
really cool thing actually to go and see
so I don't know if you happen to be in
this mech EULA area it's only about 20
to 30 minute drive out of outside of
Temecula and it's cool to just go up and
check out you do need to get in touch
them first and make an appointment but I
will put a link in the description to
their website if you guys are at all
interested but after that we came here
to where I am right now which is the
Bailey vineyard here in Temecula and
we've been enjoying a lovely lunch here
actually they it's dog friendly we're
able to bring those dogs along and they
came out with us that could even got
them burger the BAL burger
we got the bow-wow burger for the dogs
because they have a pet menu and they
devoured it here it does have the size
of a red lorry though so I guess I guess
he's just throwing its weight around a
little bit but we had a lovely meal here
for lunch and whatever what are we doing
that are we going home we are one we're
in addition wine tasting mix so with
this one
I wasn't ready to film it's okay though
we're at the different winery now part
winery the pinot gris you know reach now
he's choking on something also when we
got the dogs out of the car Nuria had
blood on her snout we don't know where
it's from because that happens with kids
a lot so I've made it back home and we
got wood I guess that is the final like
that's the resolution of this video
we got witness the piece of shows this
is walnut I'm like 95% sure it is walnut
and it's it's very hard and you guys
probably saw hopefully that it's got a
really nice flare right there in the
middle that hopefully will come out once
it has been properly sanded and finished
we got the finishing stuff over there as
well this stuff is called
unearth and it's supposed to be really
nice least if rob rob was telling the
truth which seemed like it was pretty
straightforward guy I don't see why he
would he would lead us astray there so I
can't exactly tell you guys how the next
steps are going to be with this but I'm
going to sand it we get a real nice
finish on it try to bring out any of the
natural beauty there in the wood itself
and then I'm going to map a bunch of
computer parts to it then I'm going to
stick it on the wall but I can't really
do any of that stuff yet because of
course I got thread Ripper right here to
continue work on and that's a little bit
more time-sensitive so I'm going to
continue working on that but I hope you
guys have enjoyed this sort of
in-between vlog of me taking care of a
few things around the house and of
course making a big next step with my
htpc build and I I'm not sure how that's
going to go I've had my fair share of
second thoughts today as far as how
that's actually going to work with it
wall mounted and everything so none of
you guys have a slightly better idea of
what I'm planning on doing with that let
me know what you think about it down in
the comments section of course it sums
up fund if you enjoy the video like
always subscribe if you want to see more
tech videos coming very soon especially
this threader for stuff it's looking
pretty good so far I can't really say
anything beyond that anyway guys thanks
again for watching this video and we'll
see you next n</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
