hey everyone welcome to Paul's Harbor
today I'm going to be doing unboxing and
overview of this thermal take water 2.0
extreme 240 millimeter closed-loop CPU
cooler alright guys here's a look and I
hope you can hear me okay I've kind of
repositioned the microphone and I have
no idea how well it's gonna work but
then you can't hear me I apologize
anyway here's the retail box of course
let me just give a quick once-over this
one we have top-line liquid cooler
equipped with power and performance no
refill refills needed this being a
closed loop cooler of course 240
millimeter radiator doubles your cooling
surface and universal socket
compatibility including LGA 2011 which I
will be using it for in my other video
of course we have the cooler here we've
got the block and the pump we got the
tubes connecting them white fan accents
etc let's see what else here's a chart
on the side telling you what kind of
performance you can expect so look
here's an Intel the the stock cooler
that comes with the Intel so it's kind
of comparing this one to a free cooler
or effectively free this is a core i7
975 at 4 gigahertz under hundred percent
load running at 94 degrees Celsius and
then they install this and it runs 20
degrees cooler 74 degrees Celsius lower
temperatures are better which I think
most of you guys already know let me run
down the specifications here sorry it's
a little bit crooked but we have the
waterblock which is made of copper we
have motor speed of 28 hundred rpms
rated voltage of 12 volts and the
current of 220 milliamps also the fan or
2 fans I should say the fans that are
included have a fan dimension of 120 by
120 by 25 millimeters fan speed between
1,200 and 2,000 rpms noise level of 27.3
6 decibels that's maximum voltage again
12 volts current 2.5 amps maximum
airflow 81.32 cubic feet per minute a
four pin pwm connector which is another
reason why I like the fans that are
included here they are PWM of course and
then for the radiator
here dimensions of 270 by 120 by 38.3 it
is a thicker radiator radiator than you
might find for example on the H 100 made
of aluminum its luminance not quite as
good as copper for the actual radiator
material however most of the closed-loop
solutions that you find out there and
now are made of aluminum also tubing
length of 326 millimeters
tubing material is made of rubber total
weight of 1150 grams
tomorrow fell here on the back of the
box we have a powerful cooling fans of
course two of them included fan control
software also the high performance water
block with a copper base high
reliability pump high efficiency
radiator and then some extra info here
on the features I'm not going to read
over all of those but I will talk about
the socket support LGA 2011 1366 1156
1155 775 and then that's for Intel for
AMD we have FM one am3+ a.m. 3 a.m. to +
+ a.m. - and since it's FM one it will
also fit on FM - although let's be
honest case if anyone's dropping
something like this onto a an FM one or
FM 2 socket processor that's not really
going to be the best use of it I'll just
be honest I mean maybe if you're
overclocking the bejesus out of a like
in the internal GPU or something like
that I guess maybe but I would recommend
this more for your high end overclock
you know eight core AMD's or the higher
end Intel overclocked processors because
you're really only gonna be making use
of this radiator if you're actually
overclocking other than that you I mean
you could have it run really really low
rpms and really quiet but there's other
cheaper solutions that would allow you
to do that otherwise anyway let's say I
get into the box
all right now I'm actually already sorry
I just stepped on a squeaky to it I've
actually already taken this out and I've
done a little messing around with it
just to sort of give myself some
familiarity with it before I got into
the video so sorry if this is a rienne
boxing I here's the user's manual lots
of different languages including English
of course but they're gonna walk you
through the installation steps it's
pretty pretty straightforward and it's
also pretty blasted out right now so I'm
not sure if you guys can you read it
anyway there's your users manual here is
the radiator and pump all in one unit
now one thing I find to be pretty kind
of funny I would say about these
all-in-one loops is really there's like
two companies that make them there's
actually maybe a third now because I
believe Coolermaster started actually
manufacturing these themselves but up
till now just about every single one of
these that you will see it's made either
by ACE tech or by cool it and they're
just rebranded by other companies so
this one is actually manufactured by H
Tech rebranded by Thermaltake but they
do provide the support for it they do
also handle the software they're gonna
be your go-to for the manufacturer if
you need any you know if you need to
return it or anything like that
so Thermaltake is standing behind this
product of course and they have done you
know requested eight east tech to do
some specialization with it to their
specifications so not all closed-loop
coolers are alike even if they may be
made by the same company anyway again
here nice thicker radiator this is a
thirty eight millimeter radiator
radiator as opposed to the I believe 25
millimeters is a bit more than standard
so I like that more more surface area
more cooling better overclocks more
stability nice long tubing length here
I like the flexible rubber tubing that
they have here I find it to be a little
bit more attractive than the kind of
corrugated look that you see on some of
them
nice solid water block again this is a
mounting solution I've seen in quite a
few other a stick coolers it's pretty
straight forward it's not like super
easy but I mean the mounting CPU coolers
has has always been kind of the biggest
pain in the butt of any CPU installation
or computer build process but here's a
look at this you have a USB lead coming
off of here and that's to connect to
your motherboard so that you can control
this via the software you also have a
three pin connector there that's going
to go to your CPU power it's going to
provide power to the pump you also have
two PWM four pin connectors coming off
of that and that's a plug in the two
fans so pretty straightforward as far as
assembly and get getting all your
connectors connected goes let's look at
the
rest of the components get two of these
fans as far as fans goes I'm usually the
ones that they provide with the
closed-loop coolers are decent enough
usually they provide enough static
pressure to move area over the over the
cooler often by upgrading the fans you
can actually significantly upgrade the
performance of the cooler itself I'm
gonna start off using these they're
black and white and they're actually
gonna match perfectly with the black in
my case or it's mostly a black case with
some white highlights the fractal design
r4 so I'm going to start off with these
to see how they go and then I might end
up switching them out I'm not sure again
for pin connector which I always like
PWM is superior to three pin connectors
in most respects here's your second
friend because of course there are two
and last of all of course you have all
your mounting hardware and stuff so
longer screws there to go through and
mount the fans to the case or my fans to
the radiator depending what the case may
be you have some longer adapters here
I'm pretty sure these are the socket
2011-1 so I will be needing to use those
and then here's a look at the actual
retention sort of socket so this this is
this is actually setup for a standard
intel socket right now like an 1155 and
11:56 you put these little plastic bits
here together you pop those through and
then those mount straight through to the
backplate
backplate which is right here attorney
has the adhesive strips on it again I
kind of went halfway through the the
installation process with this so you
can see the adhesive strips there these
actually make it really easy to line
that up these are different holes
depending on what socket you're using
for 1155 or 1366 all right believe 775
yeah so 775 1155 or LM 56 and 1366
they're all labeled on there stick that
on the back and then when you feed the
little plunger guys down through from
the socket they simply make contact with
those and then you bolt it in secure
everything nice and tight and these
actually I'd like I do like the design
on these because you can hand tighten
them but really to get them down
securely I would recommend grabbing a
Phillips head screwdriver and actually
mount
that in there because I found in quite a
few situations you it can feel like it's
hand tightened but actually if you get a
screwdriver and continue to tighten it
it will drop down by another probably a
couple of a couple millimeters and that
is important because this will be
putting the pressure on the actual block
right there and the pressure with that
against the actual CPU heat spreader is
what gives you good contact there and
good cooling performance so there's the
mounting hardware what else do we have
in here Audio 2.0 extreme software
included on disk
I imagine you can also download that
from the Thermaltake website I believe
that's warranty information and then
here's your AMD mounting hardware which
again it's pretty much the same as Intel
just you get the sort of rectangular set
up there so you will need to remove the
backplate for an AMD motherboard and
replace it with that and then apart from
that your actual mounting mechanism is
pretty much the same it's also easy to
drop nuts to wrap it up for this video
guys once again this has been the
thermal take water 2.0 extreme 240
millimeter closed-loop CPU cooler just
FYI I will be installing this in a build
that will be featured in an upcoming
build video here on my Paul's hardware
YouTube channel I'm installing it a
fractal r4 fractal define r4 computer
case I'm hoping that the kind of black
and white theme here will match up with
the existing black and white theme of
that computer case I'm also hoping that
the thickness of the radiator and the
fans that it will be able to fit in
there up above my motherboard I'm pretty
sure it will but who knows we'll find
out in the future that's all for this
one and if you'd like to find more tech
videos you can find them on my pulse

forget to subscribe while you're there
we'll see you all in the next video
