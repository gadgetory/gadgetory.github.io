welcome back to Pauls hardware this is
probing Paul episode number 27 this is
my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video and I didn't do it
last month so technically this is mine
for August although it is September 2nd
now and I just got back from a two-week
trip through the European Union visited
Germany as well as Austria and the Czech
Republic it was pretty cool I brought
back some spoils of my travels like I
got some Czech crowns here and I got
some euro dollars which were which are
very fun but even though I just got home
and like I haven't even unpacked one of
the first things I knew I had to do was
get my probing Paul on so thanks to you
guys who have submitted questions which
were from last month's probing poll
which it goes pretty far back there
these days supposed to comment on this
video if you want me to potentially
answer in next month's probing Paul but
let's get right to it with question
number one from Johnny t last chalasis a
eternal question here looks versus
performance with the PC he wants my
opinion on that especially with RGB
still going crazy not obvious stuff like
spend more money on bling but about
details so he has a rise in 1600 at 3.9
gigahertz 75 degrees on I 264 but he
doesn't want to give up his Wraith spire
LED because it's got that RGB ring on it
which is which is a pretty nice little
cooler especially for something that
comes relatively stuck with like an 1800
X thank you for your comment Johnny and
I'm gonna answer this two ways first for
you specifically you have a rise in 1600
at 3.9 gigahertz 75 degrees on I 264
that's a stress test so you're not going
to really be using your CPU that much in
day-to-day performance I'd be curious to
see what types of temperatures you get
when you're just gaming for example or
maybe rendering video or doing
transcoding or something like that I
think you're at a pretty good situation
so you're probably just fine sticking
with that race fire LED especially if
you like the LED if you do what I
upgrade there are sort of blinging
colorful options like maybe a cryo rig
h7 quod lumi for example that you could
upgrade to that would give you some
better performance while still giving
you that RGB goodness but more to the
general question of looks versus
performance because I have dealt with
this for a very long time and if I go
back to my old school days when I was
first building computers like in the 90s
and 2000's I would always say
performance is king always go for
performance and anything that you're
doing to make your PC pretty is
basically vanity and you should ignore
it and you should take that money and
spend it on more performance and I still
generally feel that way but I feel like
building pcs has changed somewhat used
to be more of a value proposition build
your own computer and you'll save maybe
300 bucks versus buying a prebuilt from
Gateway or whoever was building
computers back then now you don't save
as much money building your own computer
but it does make it a personal thing and
especially for PC gamers who might spend
a lot of time on it building something
that you like the looks of I think does
have some value so don't throw those
aesthetics out the window but still
generally gear yourself towards buying
stuff that's first and foremost
performance oriented and then maybe add
the blingy RGB stuff on later and even
if you're trying to build like an
all-black or just a single color PC that
still can be challenging and you still
might spend a little bit more money than
you would otherwise but making it
personal I think is important so take
that into consideration
next question from gu 38 I wanted to
know your thoughts on multiple audio
jacks featured on most motherboards do
many speakers FET setups require so many
3.5 inch jacks for multi-channel audio
and most home theater setups when an
HDMI out to make more sense if you're
using an AV receiver higher quality more
features such as Dolby and DTS streaming
compatibility and a reference there
comparing the smartphone industry which
recently removed the 3.5 inch jack so
I'm gonna use my little mini portable
benchmarking PC that I took on my trip
but I did not actually use actually
thankfully it would have been a little
challenging to do that on the road but
audio jacks right here at the back
they're multicolored so you got the
inputs your pink as the mic input blue
is a line in which I've never used for
anything before green is your standard
left and right out the orange is
subwoofer and center Channel and then
the black and sometimes gray will be
your side and your rear channels now the
reason I think so many motherboards
still
have these is legacy supports and if you
talk to motherboard manufacturers it's
always something that they're concerned
about is making a new motherboard but
let's go some older features that pisses
people off because they have some epic
7.1 channel surround sound system that
they really wanted to use those analog
outputs for but more to the fundamentals
here what you're talking about is the
difference between analog and digital
and where that conversion from a digital
audio signal to an animal analog signal
that then gets put out over your
speakers takes place if you're plugging
into the motherboards analog outputs
here then you're using the motherboards
sound hardware in order to do that DAC
work digital to analog conversion but as
you mentioned in most cases it's
actually much more sensible to do a
digital output so you can get a digital
5.1 or 7.1 output via your HDMI you can
also use the Toslink here s/pdif
connection and that will also give you
digital and you can connect that up to a
home theater
so most people I think now are not using
those analog outputs unless you're just
using the standard green jack for left
and right if you're just plugging in
headphones or something like that so it
does seem like something that we might
see go the way of the is a slot in the
future but I wouldn't expect it anytime
soon I don't think it's necessarily a
premium and space savings right there
and the motherboard i/o there's
generally a decent amount of room there
still and from other manufacturers that
put a lot of effort into the sound
circuitry like asus calls their supreme
effects and there's different variants
of that if you're not using those analog
outputs then you're not using that
componentry that's built into the
motherboard so that kind of gets wasted
next question from Clarion Hitachi hey
Paul I only have a 500 gig SSD I want to
expand my storage though I do video
editing and gaming mostly gaming and I
don't know what it should buy an SSD or
hard drive SSDs are getting really
pricey here your hard drive is really
cheap one terabyte could be useful as
since these actually have been coming
down in price so I'm just taking a quick
look at PC part picker here and I'm
sorting SSDs by price per gigabyte 13 or
14 cents price per gigabyte and look at
the capacities that you're getting the
best deals on right now it's actually
the 500 gig range SSDs even the one in
terabyte ones gotta go down here to this
inland 240 gig to get a 16 cent per gig
$40 to
forty gig SSD which is still a good
price I'm not sure about this particular
model but the point is you can get
larger capacity SSDs for cheaper these
days and 500 gig SSDs you should be able
to get for around 70 to 90 dollars now
of course if we compare that to standard
hard drives we're looking at two cents
per gig two to three cents per gig if
you're looking down here at the these
three and four terabyte models again it
depends on the capacity price per gig to
give you your total price but a three
terabyte drive for $60 or a four
terabyte drive for $85 some pretty good
deals there on capacity so my
recommendation to you would be to get
both but that's actually more because of
your use case you talked about video
editing if you're editing video it
really makes sense to have multiple
drives the best-case scenario is to have
a single Drive preferably an SSD for
your operating system and your software
another drive to have your raw video on
that your editing and then even better
to have a third drive also probably
hopefully an SSD for a cache drive but
that's getting a little bit more
advanced but the mass raw storage is
also something that you'll want
especially if you're editing video
you're gonna fill up your SSDs pretty
fast so I would recommend look into
another 500 gig SSD first because that's
where your performance will come from
but follow it up pretty quickly with a
mass storage drive again you can get a 2
or 3 terabyte hard drive for very
inexpensive these days so it's nice that
storage prices have continued to fall
and I hope that helps you next question
here from prathamesh pest Conte and this
is a similar question at least still
storage related how do I know if the
m-dot 2 slot in a laptop can accommodate
MDOT 2 SATA SSDs as well and he means as
well as nvme SSDs I am guessing so here
is an example I have two SSDs both width
and two connectors MDOT two physically
is the physical connector so you got the
connector on the SS DISA and then he has
a slot and the motherboard itself but
there are two standards to interface
standards that these can also be
compatible with so you might have a SATA
MDOT - SSD or you might have an nvme m2
SSD nvme is newer and faster and better
but sometimes you can get less expensive
SATA SSDs which are still perfectly fast
and adequate and decent enough basically
it's the same amount of
with you would get if you're connecting
to a SATA rev3 connection like a
standard SATA plug
the short answer is you need to ask your
laptop manufacturer by either
referencing the manual or going to their
website and finding specifically if your
laptop can open up and has slots in
there for MDOT two drives that you can
expand with it should be clearly listed
whether it is nvme compatible or SATA
compatible or both and sometimes if it's
both it might oughta detect or you might
need to go into your laptop's bios to
switch it until it I want nvme mode or I
want SATA mode next question here from
Kevin boggy hey Paul and many of your
budget oriented PC builds you and other
tech user youtubers really seems to be
recommendation of a SATA 3 SSD and a
SATA 3 hard drive each usually costing
50 to 60 bucks based on us pricing at
that cost why do you not recommend a
pair of raid 0 hard drives for optimal
comfortable load times both the
operating system and games he's talking
about hard drives but I'm going to
switch this in and then pretend you're
asking about raid 0 a couple of SSDs the
main reason I don't recommend hard
drives at all for operating system
drives is response time SSDs are much
much faster with response time and that
is a primary thing that makes it feel so
much faster when you're loading into
your operating system or loading out the
program that's the SSD boost that you
get now back to your question why
wouldn't you then recommend maybe to
SSDs that were less expensive and you
can rate a couple SSDs together in raid
zero and then you would get better
performance out of them and you would
combine the capacity of both the reason
there is complexity as well as failsafe
and I don't like to recommend a solution
to people that has the potential for
disaster
one of the ways we like to describe raid
zero is that you have zero fall backs if
you actually have a drive fail so two
points of failure and if either of those
dies your data is gone there's also a
little bit more complexity to setting up
raid 0
you gotta usually go into the
motherboards BIOS to turn on raid mode
and then you got to create the raid or
array and then sometimes when you're
loading windows you need to get an extra
driver in there so that windows can
recognize the raid array in order to
load onto it it's not that complex but
it's usually another step or two that a
first-time user wouldn't be as familiar
with so for that reason I usually
recommend a simpler solution of a single
SSD for your operating system and
frequently use programs and
a long-term mass storage hard drive that
you know have your backups on actually
two hard drives in raid one would be
what I really want for your long-term
storage that way you can have a little
bit of redundancy built in there that
way if you have all your you're
irreplaceable pictures personal files
and one of the drives fails you still
have a backup solution but perhaps I'll
do a more advanced like storage simple
storage solutions video in the future
that'd be a reasonable idea thank you
for your question though Kevin next up
is wd-40 with an interesting question
here why doesn't somebody make a
graphics card that literally plugs into
two PCI Express slots I mean as long as
you have a motherboard that supports 16
lines by two that would give a lot more
Headroom and more bandwidth to deliver
more power and it must although it must
be a pain in the ass k PCIe Lane
synchronized it would also allow a
massive cooler to have plenty of support
and to combat GPU sec now the first part
of your question I think it's somewhat
answered by the existence of two-way SLI
configurations like with Nvidia and they
just use an sli bridge to connect those
two cards together there is also not
really an issue of band width when it
comes to a by 16 PCI Express gen3 slot
you have some I think 32 gigabytes per
second bi-directional there so a single
graphics card even your highest then
like gtx 980ti is not going to be able
to saturate that Nvidia for example only
requires a buy eight connection in order
to support SLI configurations but the
second part of your question I think is
kind of interesting the idea that GPU
sag is a problem in a lot of situations
and there are triple slot cooler designs
would it be possible to make an
extension or an add-on to the cooler or
something that just slots into that
third PCI Express slot to provide more
support a dummy slot that doesn't
actually make connection with any of the
gold contact points I could maybe see
that happening it would hurt potentially
the compatibility of the card but what
if there was a cooler that had like a
bracket you could snap on to it and then
that would slot into the third one so
you could remove it if you didn't
necessarily have that slot right there
where it was supposed to be that's a
very interesting idea I think and I'd be
curious to know if any of my GPU
manufacturer friends have already
potentially thought of that or at least
considered it because they have lots of
ideas that don't all necessarily come to
fruition so maybe I'll ask about them
we follow-up in a future video just a
couple more quick questions here from
stop pre-ordering video games it's a
very good name does anyone know which
mouse wrist rest Paul uses the great one
and my capture PC that's that's this one
right here this is made by hand stands
and I found it's just on Amazon and I
will link this in the description I
actually tend to link this in the
description of most of my Q&amp;amp;A videos
just as a random link that goes in there
because this question actually gets
asked quite a bit this one does have
some nori fur on it but I like it
because it's got the microbeads in it
and I wanted one that's not attached to
a mousepad because I have lots of
different mouse pads and I tend to move
it around a lot from PC to PC and one of
the tricks with this that I read about
in the description is if it's a little
too full for you if you want it to be a
little bit flatter you can sort of undo
the threading here a little bit and
squeeze out some of the microbeads
and make it a little flatter for you but
I like to use a wrist rest because
economically speaking if you're using a
mouse you should try to keep the plane
of your wrist as flat as possible and I
just I'm in the habit of using your
stress and I like this one and the last
question from Patrick Stewart I'm
honored sir
how many probes can Paul take before
it's too much it's a good question
probably as eternal a question as the
first question in this video about looks
versus performance but I think many more
many many more probings are still to
come so guys thank you so much for
watching this video I hope you maybe
have learned a few things or maybe just
enjoyed hanging out with me if you know
the conversion rate for Czech koruna
then let me know how much this is
actually worth this is this is 70 I have
70 Czech crowns right here ready to
ready to spend next time I'm in the
Czech Republic Prague was beautiful but
guys leave questions in the comment
section down below if you want me to
answer them in next month's probing Paul
which will probably just be in a few
months since it's already September
thank you so much for watching this
video once again and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
