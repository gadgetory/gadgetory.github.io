monthly builds video as well as a couple
other random build videos that I've done
in the past say month or two I have
gotten a repeated question and that is
hey Paul you mentioned this website
kinguin or something like that and you
mentioned getting Windows 10 on the
cheap so I decided to make a video
specifically about that I'm gonna walk
you through my process of actually
purchasing a Windows 10 license from
King wind net that's ki ng u I n so like
penguin with a king its costs about
nineteen or twenty dollars u.s. from
there I'm going to go through the
process of installing it on this the
little computer that I built for my
parents just recently and and hopefully
you guys will learn a little bit of
something and maybe find a new source
for getting yourself a Windows license
because lord knows every time I put a
new computer together I don't
necessarily want to drop another hundred
bucks on getting Windows for it but
windows in a lot of situations is just
kind of required if you build your own
computer Linux and all that stuff yes we
could get into our argument that's not
what this video is about anyway apart
from a built computer without an
operating system on it you will need a
USB Drive I'm using an eight gig one but
you need for gigs minimum and I do
recommend going with a USB 2.0 go little
old-school with this one don't get the
newer USB three or 3.1 drives just for
compatibility sake stick with USB two
and I'll show you how to get that
installed in just a second now I should
give full disclosure here about my
association with kinguin net there is
none I I don't know anyone there
apart from following them on Twitter
recently this is not paid or anything
like that I was originally introduced to
kinguin net through the website called
fast to play fast number to play which
is a website I was introduced to by my
friend Steve who likes to buy video
games on the cheap
anyway fast to play was purchased or
acquired or merged with kinguin net so
as I was going too fast to play to like
buy cheap games I was redirected here
and I've discovered that they also have
Windows licenses so if you just go and
search for Windows you can find us well
they'll have varying licenses available
I'm sure they have stock
that comes and goes and all that kind of
thing but look at look here Windows 10
Professional OEM key this is the one I'm
going to be getting it's $19 right now
if you are shopping here
bear in mind some of these things like
worldwide you will want to pay attention
to the where the software is eligible so
definitely make sure it's got that
worldwide worldwide indicator
unfortunately all these Windows licenses
do and also hey if you don't want
Windows 10 they've also got Windows 7
Windows 8 Windows 8.1 and if you do get
seven or eight or 8.1 you will be able
to you'll almost be forced to upgrade to
Windows 10 eventually but that is a way
if you want to start off with something
that you're a bit more familiar with in
the upgrade to Windows 10 in the future
you can do that I do want to point out
here a significant difference here
between what and om key is and what a
retail key is not that I can click and
drag these or anything like that but om
is Original Equipment Manufacturer
basically if you buy an OEM key you are
saying that I and the manufacturer of
this of this computer which I am
comfortable doing if you guys are a
little bit worried or if it's your first
time or if you just want to make sure
that if something happens in the future
you might consider paying that extra 20
bucks or so to get yourself a retail key
the main difference that I found between
the OEM and retail key is going to be in
the future if you ever make a hardware
change or an update or something like
that if you have an OEM key and you try
to contact Microsoft for assistance with
activation they will probably not help
you they'll say go to your system
manufacturer and you'd be like I am the
system manufacturing then they'd be like
well you should be able to solve your
own problem in if you ever have had a
situation with a Windows license
deactivating or something like that
calling in or using the automated lines
for activation is not that difficult but
it is much more much more effective with
retail key have any real try it with an
OEM key now if you're super nervous
about buying a Windows license for $20
you know like this can't this just can't
be legit drop an extra dollar and nine
cents on the King Wynn buyer protection
and that will allow you to you know if
you try to activate it and it says don't
work then you know kinguin will will
support you and give you a refund
hopefully something like that anyway oh
look add-on items that's pretty common
in websites moving right along to our
checkout anyway
we go through checkout guys I'll be
right back so I was able to checkout
with PayPal my total was like twenty
dollars and eighty-eight cents and then
after the transaction goes through you
get an email letting you know it's okay
you can go to the kinguin website then
you go to your games and then you click
on show the key and I have the key
already over here I'm not going to show
you guys the keys my key but then you
can also either go straight to the
Microsoft website or if you go to the
activation instructions on kinguin it
will redirect you over here to actually
download Windows 10 I don't want to
upgrade now I want to create a USB DVD
or ISO so we want to what what do we do
here read all this information to make
sure you have what you need and then
you're going to download a tool and that
will help you to create your media the
media creation tool exe I'm just going
to go ahead and open that and oh god
okay that's fine everything's fine and
then this will pop you into this Windows
10 setup thing and again I'm not going
to show you guys all the gritty details
for this but basically take your USB
Drive and plug it into a USB port okay
so will definitely accept these license
terms
did I mention at the beginning when I
was telling you guys what you needed for
this that you do need another computer a
separate working computer to make this
yeah I probably should have mentioned
that but hopefully it goes without
saying anyway create installation media
for another PC language Edition
architecture sure yeah we definitely
want 64-bit don't go 32 go 64 use
recommended options ok share you I
recommended options that's fine we're
doing it on a USB flash drive so I'll
hit next we will select the flash drive
it's the only one connected hit next
again and then it's going to go through
the procedures for making the Windows 10
installation media I'll let this go and
I'll be right back alright we've hit 100
percent USB flash drive is ready it took
maybe 15 to 20 minutes all told that was
to download and set up the USB Drive and
that's going to depend based on your
downloads they're very based on your
download speeds I'm just going to hit
finish and lastly well not lastly but
next I'm going to switch over here so I
can start capturing what's going on in
the system so I'll be right back I'm
also going to well I can
this grab the actual USB drive and plug
it into this system into a USB 2.0 port
not a USB 3.0 again USB 2.0 in my
experience with windows installations
leads to less complications I don't know
if that's the fact if that's the same
with Windows 10 or not but I'm just
going to do it I lost audio while I was
recording this next part but here's how
things happened I was able to boot up
the system without having to go into the
BIOS and change the boot device which
was nice and went straight through the
USB and then went to the Windows 10
installer the Windows 10 installer will
ask for that product key right up front
fortunately my new key worked just fine
to move on with the installation process
on this next menu I will always choose
custom installation and I like to delete
any existing partitions off of the drive
that I'm installing too now another 10
to 15-minute wait while files copy over
and then an automatic reboot after that
you go through the Windows 10 setup
procedures
fortunately the system rebooted itself
um I went and booted straight off of the
SSD as it should have I did go into the
advanced setup procedures to pretty much
turn off as much tracking stuff as I
possibly could and here's a big big
shout-out to my friend Jerry aka
barnacle ease if you guys really wants
to dig into the Windows 10 settings and
get rid of a lot of the windows 10
spying stuff or just activity tracking
and monitoring and then that kind of
thing I will link his video in the
description as well so you can check
that out and get Windows 10 set up a
little bit more precisely that's it to
root out some of those Windows is
watching you type features anyway though
after another minute or two of final
setup stuff just like that Windows 10 is
installed since my main question here is
whether or not this key will activate
I'm going to pull up the activation
settings right away and only now will I
actually plug in the Internet to this
new computer windows will automatically
activate if there is an internet
connection so without me doing anything
the message updated that Windows had
activated as soon as the internet
connection appeared it looks like my
kinguin om key is legit the moment of
truth that was the like will this work I
wanted that's this computer with that
key I just purchased connecting to the
Windows servers and Windows server is
saying hey you're good to go with your
Windows 10 Pro om key
many bucks so hey I'm happy with that it
seems to have worked right off the bat
even though I got cables running in
front of me let me mention a couple
closing thoughts here before I finish
out this video um one is I learned that
kinguin net is based in Hong Kong I
don't know if that's important or not
two would be an alternative cheap
windows purchasing solution that I have
used in the past is reddit's the
subreddit micro set Microsoft software
swap where you can also get very
inexpensive just just installation keys
for not just Windows but also like
Microsoft's Office suite and that kind
of thing I've used that before it worked
good for me for office however I had two
systems that I got Windows Keys for one
Windows 7 and one Windows 8 that
deactivated like months later so I went
through this it activated it said it was
fine and then months later suddenly I
got a message hey your keys invalid I
did contact the guy on Microsoft
software sawed the swap that I got it
from it was just it was a person rather
than a company like kinguin net so
anyway that's why I've gone this route
rather than that route all of that route
is is also viable I guess but I feel a
little bit safer doing this and also
doing that little you know $1 for a
buyer protection as well so that if this
did have a problem you can go right back
to kinguin net the final thing I checked
out just looking a little bit closer at
the kinguin net website is actually
these keys are sold by third parties so
kinguin is kind of acting like an Amazon
Marketplace seller and these sellers are
selling the keys through it so there's
actually a bunch of sellers of these
keys who had them listed for 20 bucks
each which means that you know you're
getting them from different locations
but Qinglin seems to be standing behind
them and again you know pay a dollar for
that buyer protection and I think you'll
be all set to go anyway guys I hope
you've learned a little bit from this
video whether it's about the general
procedure for installing Windows 10 or
maybe just a much less expensive means
of getting Windows 10 versus paying the
80 200 bucks
buying it at retail again consider those
retail keys that are available say 40
ish or 40 to $50 if you do want a little
bit more back-end support from Microsoft
but I think om in this case is going to
do just fine anyway thanks a lot for
watching this video
you appreciate it it hit the like button
if you enjoyed it check out my store if
you want to buy pulse hardware shirts
mugs ooh glasses and we'll see you next
time thanks for watching guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
