guys guys oh my gosh oh my gosh Wow
okay Wow so guys it has finally happened
I am ecstatic right now because if you
can see right here six hundred and fifty
five thousand four hundred and eighty
two subscribers I never thought I would
get to this point I started out making
YouTube videos years and years ago I I
appreciate all of your support over the
years and now that I've achieved this
landmark subscriber number though I have
something really huge planned for you
guys I was waiting I was waiting as a
lot of you probably already suspected
was waiting for this key moment in time
so that I can celebrate along with you
guys and say a big thank you to all my
subscribers so today I have a massive
giveaway it's been put together in
coordination with main gear and
basically this system let's let's get
this fired up so first let me address
that my setup here is completely a
chaotic mess because I have several
projects that are ongoing here's the
system I'm gonna be giving away this is
the main gear razor r1 special edition
system that I did a video on called how
to cheat at building computers so check
that out if you want a much better full
look at the system I'm going to fire it
up real quick because it looks pretty
cool it's been in the background of my
set for quite some time and I have to
say I'm very embarrassed but I have not
used this system nearly as much mainly
it's because I haven't had a chance to
do much gaming recently and this is
usually where I would sit down to play
some video games but there it is and
I'll come back to that in just a second
so part of the reason I need to sort of
clear some space out is because I am on
I'm continuing work on arctic panther
car and that still has a lot of work to
be done on it
but in the meantime I'm gonna put it
over here once it's finished but this
system could really use a better home
and someone who will actually get a lot
more out of it than I have been getting
I am blessed with having access to way
too many computers so this one I just
haven't been using that much
and besides like I said I'm building
arctic panther RR and that's gonna
replace this one so what is gonna happen
is one of you lucky viewers it's gonna
benefit and it's gonna get this to take
home just pop up the side panel window
really quick and there she is so what I
did was I hit up main gear and I said
hey main gear you guys sent me this
system over it's freaking awesome I
haven't been neglecting it so let's find
something better to do with this and I
asked them hey if I give this system
away to one of the fans who subscribes
to my channel
will you guys extend warranty coverage
to them and help out with shipping
because shipping something like this is
fairly expensive they were like yes no
problem Paul we got you covered so main
here is going to be extending warranty
support which is awesome they do an
amazing job giving support to users
after they've purchased systems from
them so you'll get the main gear support
you'll get the system with suite which
features an AMD 1800 X and D Rison 1800
X processor the eight core in their full
liquid cooling loop as you can probably
see it's all custom done they've got
some quick disconnects placed in
strategic areas and that kind of thing
it's got a really cool sort of lime
green fluid going through everything
these are two gtx 1080s that are of
course also custom water-cooled with
main gear back plates reflective nickel
coated back plates from EK tons of
fittings and everything in here from I
believe ek coolants and bits power it's
got a samsung 960 pro nvme SSD it's got
an additional mechanical hard drive in
there for storage it has two three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiators
at the front and at the top and I have
much better footage and some testing on
the system on the video so I strongly
encourage you guys to check that out
it's in the NZXT hph 440 razor Edition
right there so whoever wins this is
going to be set for gaming for streaming
for multitasking anything you want to do
with this the system can handle it for
sure
and guys I think that pretty much covers
it I'm gonna finish off this video by
showing a quick montage of the work I'm
gonna do for the next hour which is
gonna be to pack the system back up I
did save all the packing materials and a
couple huge boxes for this that's part
of the reason it's also taking up so
much space here so main gear also does a
really good job of packing their systems
so I'm confident that this is gonna get
to whoever wins it safely and securely
because I saved all that fecking stuff
and I do want to point out that this
giveaway is open to North American
subscribers only that's US and Canada
I'm really sorry to international
subscribers I love to do giveaways that
includes you guys as well but the fact
is that shipping for something like this
as well as extending warranty service
internationally which is too much of a
challenge to work out so I do have some
plans for an international giveaway to
come up very soon though I'm thinking
around maybe the seven hundred and
twelve thousand two hundred and sixty
two mark I think that's probably the
next big milestone that I'm gonna hit
for that one so anyway I've already
gained I've already gained six more
subscribers while I've been doing this
video I'm up to 655 489 now 49 so thanks
to any of you guys who have been
subscribing I'm gonna get this packed up
oh also on how to enter there is a gleam
I'll link in this video's description
just click on that there's four ways to
enter we just need your email address
and make sure you check your email
address this is going to be open for two
weeks and then a couple days after that
I will be announcing the winner on
Twitter there's four ways to enter
subscribe to my channel of course you're
probably already done that but that's
just going to ask you to verify that
follow me on Twitter and then subscribe

believe is Twitter but I'll confirm that
soon anyway guys thank you so much for
