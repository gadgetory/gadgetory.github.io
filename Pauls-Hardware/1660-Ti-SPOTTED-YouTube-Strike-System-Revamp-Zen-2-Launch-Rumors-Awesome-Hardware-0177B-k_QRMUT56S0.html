okay wait now I'm clicking the wrong
thing there damn it
hi everyone welcome welcome hello I hope
you guys are having well great welcome
great and fantastic day I'm just pasting
that there so I can actually make sure
that this is functional yes it should be
it is hi everyone welcome to awesome
hardware this is a live show Kyle and I
do we talk about technology computers
computer parts as well as just any
random stuff that happens to pop into
our heads that we think might be
interesting extreme every Tuesday
evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time we stream
to twitch TV / awesome hardware
the whole show unedited and unfettered
unfettered like I was which one's mine
either one is fine your pink and we also
stream to our YouTube channels we
already finished the first half of this
show episode 177 a which is on Kyle's
channel that's linked to the description
so if you missed it you can go watch
that talked about many interesting
things and we we critiqued many
computers we did pimp my PC hardcore big
ass - my PC we did quick warning we
drink alcohol in the show you know in
moderation feel free to join us it man
juice you can do so legally and
responsibly of course nectar of the gods
and we occasionally use adult language
so taxes be forewarned of that property
debts we owe motors insurance no to
offend me but Kyle's just moved into a
new house can you go
around me so there adds a lot to it I
feel your pain now alright so before we
get too far oh my god let's go literally
just like my elbow here I don't know if
it's hard to believe but I don't have my
elbow licked randomly often what happens
it gives me a jump it's it's it's it's
shocking at first and then pleasant it's
like a it's like a Sour Patch Kid yeah
first it's sour and then it's sweet and
he has a very big tongue that it's it's
soft yeah right and it almost feel it
feels very OH
whether you can cold wet I used to
everyone say that he rolled out he's the
mascot to foster Park truly if you'd
like to help by Hiro some dog food
because you know it does trickle down
that way that helps feel free to shop on
my store
Paul's Arbor net for my store you can
buy shirts mugs pint glasses other
paraphernalia is they're all real
high-quality and you get stuffs
emergency help support the channel it's
a good it's a good thing Cal stores bit
with tech slash store he also has
merchandise if you're perusing the
awesome hardware merch a lot of these
designs were submitted by fans by the
way hey-oh JTED did this one if you
might have some harder emerg the
proceeds are split between us so feel
free to order from either of our stores
and we of course thank you very much Lee
thank you for having much support us in
that way and we will shout out your name
and Johnson towards the end of this half
of the show but we will give a big
thanks to people who bought stuff while
we are live we're of course you can buy
stuff whenever but if you happen to buy
Our Lives then you get a special thanks
from us and whoa whoa whoa God why is
this playing right now that's weird
because your volumes
nope it's gone forever one last quick
note before we dive into some tech news
Steve our friend from gamers Nexus has
been promoting donations if you donate
and you tweet about it tweet something
positive we've been challenged to you
know
money where our mouth is I guess to some
degree Steve's donation went to Eden
products I'm sorry
Eden projects org Kyle and I have also
made a donation there they plant trees
around the world and and it's it's a
great great charity to donate to of
course Steve is encouraging people to
donate to any charity that you might
happen to feel like donating to as long
as it's a good one
only good charities go into all the bad
charities out there yes and I was gonna
say tonight it's gonna try to pull up
Steve sting but I'm I'm behind the times
here where's there's a game
you
okay sorry sorry about that guys in an
attempt to get our audio back up to
snuff on our show I've switched back to
the overhead mics but those also pick up
the dogs a lot when they happen to freak
out
sorry about that ser about that it's
been fixed now point being small text
Claire yes point being gamers Nexus
Steve I don't know go follow them on
Twitter twitter.com slash game uses
YouTube - yes so yeah we are we all
donated well I remember I was gonna say
he was telling me how many how many
trees we we we are gonna play it now he
said it costs this organization anywhere
from 10 cents to 35 cents to plant a
tree so with the amount that we donated
which I do any a thousand you donated 1
3 3 7 which is yeah supers is elite it
was a school leet speak reference which
means most people don't don't know what
that means which means we donated doubt
like did thousands of trees we
contributed to thousands of trees being
planted in which means thousands of jobs
Eden reforestation project has a total
cost per tree of 10 cents to 35 cents
depending on the region alright that
counts the salaries and administration
fees and everything for the trees that
are planted but not not just the trees
the cost of the treats planting with the
people who are planting them and
everything for us there's an
infrastructure there so for that puts me
at 1,300 I'm sorry 13,000 337 trees
planted or if if they're doing mangroves
which they do in Madagascar
3300 mangroves so sexist as so many
mangroves
I think the sjw's are triggered right
now why aren't they women groves or they
groves mangroves are awesome they
provide they provide a bunch of like a
very important there trees that usually
there along shorelines like right off
shore ok and they grow up out of the
water so you can kind of see their their
roots going down down into the water so
a lot of
cool I don't know I don't want to say
tropical subtropical I don't wanna say
anything but here is your bench trees
but yeah but waves that come in like the
the the waves are kind of baffled by
them so it calms that down so it
prevents erosion of this of the
shoreline so they're really important
for everyone in a lot of places very
helpful okay
nature yes I have a super cool spider
spider fan by the way shout out the
spider fan modern and chat thanks for
being here today man you know as well as
of course cell processing our longtime
moderator I have I have like a little
bit of tree knowledge but my older
sister she's actually like oh yeah she
jumped she knows trees yeah which is all
about the trees she's all about the
trees yeah she anyway I was gonna tell
you like what her job is and stuff but I
never ever I haven't talked to her about
that and I have no idea if she wants me
shame that I she has a really cool job
that's related to trees and it's not
weed related for anyone who's done that
right now you oh really
well now I'm very curious as to why it
wouldn't be you know what her job is
don't if I did maybe I did I forgot by I
have no idea
I know it's just you're talking about it
Sam I'll talk about it later okay sure
it's cool alright let's talk about some
tech news we actually do have a bit of
that today the msi gtx 660ti gaming X
had an unboxing video appear on YouTube
for it yes
earlier today the actual see the video
as you can maybe tell has been removed
but the source of the video
PC gamer oh it's PC gamer that wasn't PC
gamer it's PC gamer from a different
region wait wait PC world PC world my
best PC world
Oh Bulgaria distinction there PC world
Bulgaria uploaded an unboxing video of
MSI's gtx 660ti gaming x graphics card
to the youtube channel word now for the
record we've talked about the past
existence of a 16-6 TTI on our show cuz
there have been some rumors bouncing
around speculation as to what the name
may or may not be if you believe that
this is true not that you could watch
the video anymore but there are some
screen caps from this article on
overclocked 3d net which is linked in
the description by the way of said
graphics card now that right there that
couldn't be anything else and then a
16-6 ETA irrefutable proof there's the
back plate evidence right I mean that
does look like a back way Paul 1660s
here I can confirm no realistically
speaking though the actual video has a
bunch of other stuff like turning the
graphics card over taking it out of the
box itself appears very convincing then
there is a 16 60 TI that exists what do
you think do you think it's fake let's
let's let's hold off on that before we
say whether or not we think it's fake
mmm let's let's talk about no there's no
certify where you I mean that would have
been a great that would have been a
great pitch for a later sword fight but
we're not doing certify sorry but next
week maybe
hey everyone subscribed alright so what
can be derived from this video what can
we learn about the graphics card from
what was shown assuming of course it is
true one
it's a gtx card not an r TX card which
seems to no ridges validate the rumors
that they're gonna go with a gtx or go
back to the gtx nomenclature for their
lower end graphics cards also the box
that they showed does not show any r-tx
features listed for the graphics card so
ray tracing as well as dl SS for deep
learning super sampling which is the
artificial intelligence enhanced dl SS
thing which according to recent reviews
of the update to battlefield 5 that has
that enabled and aren't not there aren't
blowing people away so far but instead
the
referenced Turing shaders so the
assumption there is that there are no RT
cores or tensor cores in here you just
got the Turing shooter so you've got the
updates of the Turing GPU architecture
which are good but you know but you
don't have those little extra things
that they added on with the Archie
x-series which is fun which it may be it
may be you're happy about because you
don't care about any of those things
because there really haven't been very
many compelling actual examples of those
put to put to good use are we closer to
confirming what kind of performance so
we can get this card what car is is
closest to where is it position um
that's that's tailed if it remains
difficult to say Cal's cuz cuz really
the video itself was just an unboxing
video there were there were no
performance numbers or anything we're
still mainly relying on rumors and early
information about that so who knows if
it's if they're calling it a sixteen
sixty Ti and the 2060 has already
launched for 350 bucks I would expect it
to be something like tens GTX 1060
replacement because that's all that's
really left if you go below the 1070
which has been replaced by the 2060 and
in that case it would probably cost two
hundred to three hundred dollars because
that's what the 2060 that's what the
1060 is has cost it's it is it just me
isn't this like the weirdest naming
scheme though if it is a sixteen sixty
you're getting a getting ahead getting
at tops right Jeb stuck with the name
again just sec chip other information
about the car that can be derived from
these pictures supposedly there's an
8-pin graphics power connector I mean
that that there's some significance
there the display outputs are also shown
not in these pictures here but they were
shown in the video there's three
DisplayPort 1.4 outputs and one HDMI 2.0
B output which means no support for
virtual links so it doesn't have that
little type-c connector for that also no
DVID connectors although an HDMI to DVI
adapter will work just fine for anyone
who needs DVID connectivity or just the
DVI cable to HDMI cable from your
monitor but damn I mean sometimes that's
a consideration for more budget graphics
cards and people who are using older
monitors other than that though it's got
GTX instead of r-tx branding on the box
its twin froze or seven cooler the
design looks exactly the same as the MSI
r-tx 2060 gaming X as you mentioned no
Kyle
sixteen sixty TI who are they trying to
fool here my opinion mm-hmm this is a
plant this is obviously a hoax
AMD probably put this all together
usually that's where the stuffs
originates I'm listening yeah you know
AMD they're probably they mocked up the
card you know threw it out there they're
trying to throw shade to conflict with
Nvidia let's make them look bad in GA
versus Nvidia uh nice to me cuz AMD has
the rx 590 which is which is a very
probably I'm probably way better than
whatever this is not that this is a
thing because it's probably fake and and
even made a fake this so you're saying
is AMD has no cards good enough to rival
any equivalent Nvidia cards so they
created an inferior Nvidia cards so that
they would have this seemingly have a
superior response to it you hit the nail
on the head there Kyle it's exactly
under sounds legit yeah I think it
checks out of course you could also
follow that up with the fact that
there's some ZOTAC GeForce GTX 16 TI amp
Edition Oh
with twin fan named DS really on it
they're playing it up
so obviously Wow yeah you know they've
been very thorough here these are not
real pictures though these are I gotta
say Paul I can tell from these pictures
they these are just renders the fact
that they're having multiple Adam board
partners in on this makes it seem like
this is a coordinated harassment
campaign it does that does kind of
strike me as potentially a coordinated
her asking harassment campaign harasser
harassment harassment there's those
video outs though they're the
DisplayPort maybe
one point force in the HDMI 2.0 be with
no type see you can tell it to be
because of the because of all that
there's a there's also the non amp
version which is which sucks why would
you buy that when there's the amp
version who doesn't want to be gang up
you stupid consumer Jesus okay Jesus
there it is though the Emma the 1660 ti
obviously not a thing
moving on double press the button here
we go here's a WCC F Tech article about
AMD's rise in 3000 CPUs not just that
though also Radeon Navi GPUs x5 70
motherboards with PCI Express 4.0 we got
a launch date oh yeah we know when these
are launching now maybe maybe this is a
rumor this is a rumor we should specify
that it's a domestic there's Lisa sue
this is obviously a render of Lisa sue
yeah she's a hologram no point being
though puts on a great show so so here's
the AMD very proud of their seven
nanometer technology which which they
should be I feel like and part of the
reason they named the Radeon seven the
Radeon seven was to specifically hey
guys seven nanometer texture yeah seven
native and seven enemy in a
manufacturing process I should say even
though it's still Vega architecture
didn't even though the performance was
kinda like yeah is right but 7 nanometre
GPU that they have now launched even
though it's sold out everywhere point
being they have new 7 nanometre stuff
coming out really soon
we got resin 3000 series those are those
are CPUs there's going to be different
variants of them made for for mobile
systems but the desktop ones are what we
are excited about these were shown and
teased at CES this year and they're
based on 790 meter manufacturing process
use a little chip 'lets yeah very cute
they cute little little 8 cores
chip --let's potentially could put two
of monsters put two of them on one of
those little substrate packages that
they show it off for us baby so up to 16
cores
per single CPU on the mainstream
platform that's pretty badass
but seven nanometer for that also the
new Navi architecture which is seven
nanometer but not just like Vega shrunk
down to seven nanometer which was the
Radeon seven was but actually designed
specifically for seven animator it's
like a completely new new architecture
so you know potentially to not be
disappointing like like like Vega and
and Radeon seven were right so seven
right seven seven seven seven so what's
the best time to launch something very 7
based seven seven
Oh on the seventh month of the year of
them seventh day yes exactly July 7th is
when this WCC F Tech article speculates
that the launch will be of this and this
is all based on rumors from a read
gaming tech article which is linked
linked in this article if you guys want
to read both of them to better son who
said that the information came from a
very reliable source so if you trust
read gaming tech and they're very
reliable source then maybe aim DS
awesome new stuff will be launching on
July 7th reasons I mean if you're
looking at object and looking at it
objectively that's there's there's some
reasonable you know it's it's not out of
the realm of possibility so it does seem
like a viable rumor right
for instance when rising to launched
last year they announced it at Computex
in June and then it actually launched
about two months two months later in
August so then potentially announcing
rise in three or rise in 3000 series was
then two and then launching it may be
about a month later in July also it
doesn't seem too crazy or outside the
realm of possibility sure there is sort
of a maybe possibly timeline linked in
the article to this was actually put
together by planet 3d now that de but
here you can see in q1 we've got the
rise in 3000 stuff on APU APU is coming
up from the mobile
for mobile space and then in q2 we have
the 3000 series for desktop coming up
Picasso which I am actually I would
actually be somewhat excited about to
see what they're doing when it comes to
the graphics integrated there sorry
about that
no my wife my wife is home and then in
June we got epic too so that might be
what they actually show at Computex on
those and a server space and then July
rise in 3000 August thread Ripper 3000
mmm all very exciting things following
up to that the navi side of it the GPU
side you know it would be really cool if
they were able to launch both of those
at the same time but there have also
been recent rumors about na'vi being
delayed possibly until october since
these are all rumors you have to say is
one rumor more accurate than the other
rumor and we can't really confirm or
deny that for you guys but there it is
there maybe you have the fact maybe
things will be happening yeah and any
set and at any event I'm pretty sure we
will be getting Sampson we will samples
hopefully but we will be getting Zen too
this year mid-year so yeah so cool hey
yeah all right let's move on
ee times here has an article about bad
photoresists which are costing TSMC 550
million dollars that's a lot
TSM see if you guys aren't familiar is
at Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Corporation they they have fabs I have
multiple fabs superfan and they actually
are the ones who like action to
manufacture chips like graphics chips
GPUs they do CPUs they do a bunch of
different stuff
this article is about them them stating
that they're reducing their forecasts
for q1 of 2019 based on this photo
resist problem what's what's that
so photo resist is a it's it's a photo
reactive layer it responds to light I
don't want to try to explain it further
than that because I probably get it
wrong but it's used in various
manufacturing processes okay
yeah the TSM see itself scrapped a bunch
of wafers after using substandard
photoresist at one of the largest babs
which is 14 B in tanana
which is in southern Taiwan this
affected their production of 12 and 16
nanometer wafers where they make chips
for customers which include mediatek
high silicon and nvidia it's the main
reason I'm bringing this up I mean as
far as it associates to us as a result
they cut 550 million dollars or about 7%
from their previous forecast of seven
point four billion dollars for revenue
for the first quarter of 2019 this is
TSMC second disruption along these lines
in less than six months back in less
than six months back in august of 2018
they spent three days doing nothing
after newly installed equipment was
infected with the wanna cry a virus so
that's sort of unrelated but you know
just associated and the effect that it
prevented them from continued continuing
to produce wafers with integrated
circuits on them this particular delay
is estimated to have caused them to have
scrapped as many as 30,000 wafers which
is quite a few but the report said that
however given that Nvidia downgraded
November to January sales guidance on
the 28th of January and demand for
Chinese smartphones has been weak since
November wafer inventories are high
which should cover the shortfall
basically the saying that this happened
at a good time because Nvidia is already
over stocked and you know they're
they've been taking some losses they
they haven't been performing as well as
they expected there's a lot some other
factors in China so there you go
although they did specifically talk
about in video there TSMC did not name
affected customers so we can't
specifically say you know this is
affected in videos you know fabrication
of NVIDIA GPU don't even those 30,000
wafers were allocated for NVIDIA we
don't know and we can't say for sure and
it may be that it was maybe that it
wasn't all we know is that they're
affected customers they have worked out
replacement and delivery schedules with
each of their affected customers do we
know how many chips are in a wafer on
average it depends on the size of the
wafer itself because those have
different sizes and then actual
depending on the architecture of the
chip that's being designed that has a
specific effect specific size as well
based on that it's really good general
range they're taking hundreds or
thousands I don't know I couldn't say
off the top of my head I'd be cool if I
couldn't know I feel I feel I feel very
special if I could do that if you guys
are curious when it comes to 12
nanometer 16 nanometer TSMC
manufacturing process the nvidia gtx 10
series GPUs are 60 nanometers MC that
includes the 10 60 on up to the 10 80 TI
as well as the Titan X and Titan xp for
12 nanometer that's the Archie X 20
series so basically all the RT X cards
that are out right now which may have
been affected by this
I would I would speculate a lesser
chance that the 10 series was affected
because I believe they stopped producing
those but there is a possibility I would
think maybe that the RT X series was
affected but as the article mentions and
as we've kind of talked about the r-tx
series hasn't hasn't been selling that
well they haven't been doing that great
so great when it comes to something that
might affect cost or whatever I would
speculate maybe it wouldn't simply
because they've already got inventory
out there that's not really selling you
know it's selling but not super fast so
there you go anyway
but we're not YouTube has completely
changed their revamp their strike system
all because of Kyle this is Kyle's fault
he did it they I spawned him any
influencer all right so to be clear if
you guys have been following any of the
tech YouTube drama over the past week
chances are that did not affect this at
all this is most likely something that
has been in the works and speculating
here but maybe due to the upcoming
potential changes in the EU
all that said YouTube is revamping it
strike system and if you're not familiar
with what it's strike system is YouTube
allows anyone to upload videos to the
internet YouTube is under some
obligation to make sure that their
service isn't hosting copyrighted or
offensive material when it comes to
copyrighted material in particular if
something is uploaded that a copyright
holder feels is egregious or steps over
the line when in terms of preventing the
copyright holder for I don't know
there's there's legal terms around this
it all goes back to the DMCA Digital
Digital Millennium Copyright Act and
what's called the takedown notice this
is what happened to Kyle just in the
past week the verge did it that's why
the sounds all familiar to him now Kyle
fortunately had his strike lifted the
verge did do that credit to them for
that I shouldn't have done the strike in
the first place but we should clarify
here that a strike or a DMCA takedown as
different from
what is known as a Content ID a
copyright claim claims so YouTube has an
automated system that will look at
videos and be like alright this this
matches with you know a song we have or
something like it so automated Content
ID and then that might do a claim on a
video and a claim on a video just means
that the revenue from that video gets
real reality re rerouted to the claim
holder anyway
wait being here just like we're talking
about the strike system it's more
serious they've changed it what's
different and others a there's a YouTube
page about this their actual
announcement on YouTube on their creator
blog alright so you now get a one-time
warning you get a firm talking-to and
yes shake of the hand so Kyle if if so
if what happened to you was in a month
or two in the future yeah other than
having a strike issued on your channel
you would have gotten a one-time warning
with the video in question would have
been taken down but I'm you know what
strike immediate you wouldn't have had
immediately gotten the strike but right
it's a one-time warning which means that
after that one thing had happened even
though fuckery it's been pretty well
demonstrated at this point that you were
in the right and that that was not a
legitimate strike right and here's a
good question yeah it was they they
withdrew it so do a reset a warning yet
would the warning reset yeah now to be
clear here it's good that a creator a
content creator somebody posting content
to YouTube would have the opportunity to
get a warning about something that
they're posting because as the creator
blog posts themselves says like 98% of
you like hourly right you're totally
fine with this and never violate stuff
um so yeah
one-time warning I guess it's nice that
it's there whereas it wasn't before but
again it's a one-time warning so it just
feels like something that could be burnt
up spurious ly potentially right and
then you go to
the new strike system yeah all right
new strike system for the first strike
you get you there is an immediate
one-week freeze on your ability to
upload any new content to YouTube that
includes live-streaming that includes
videos that includes stories and that
includes posts as far as I know that is
everything all YouTube active you don't
have YouTube for a week you're banned
from YouTube for a week one week freeze
including live-streaming and other
channel activities the second strike in
a 90-day period so you would have to do
repeated stuff with the same time frame
would be a two-week freeze on the
ability to upload or post any new
content yeah and then the third strike
is channel termination as it has been in
the past so first strike prior to now
has caused the channel to not be able to
livestream mm-hmm
that was one of the complaints I guess
they got was like well if somebody's
posting videos right and they get a
strike you're penalizing their ability
to livestream it's kind of not
necessarily associated right but
whatever this this so this doesn't seem
like a great solution to me because I
feel like what should what should really
happen is the Creator who is being you
know like potentially striked or having
their content flagged they should have
the right to dispute it or request a
retraction of proposed strike before the
warning is ever issued for example you
don't issue a warning unless there's
something to be warned of so there's a
lot of questions here with with the new
with the new system exactly how liberal
are they gonna be with issuing these
warnings you know do we have a chance to
defend ourselves before a warning is
ever issued out or as or as a warning
just another like pre strike that we we
don't have a chance to defend ourselves
with before it's carried out because
otherwise it's just it's just prolonging
the inevitable which is the current
system that it already is so I think I
think at the end of the day there needs
to be more communication between YouTube
between the plaintiffs and the Creator
who created the work there needs to be
more communication initially before any
action is taken whether that action be a
strike or a warning because now like a
warning is kind of like the new strike
in a way yeah it doesn't take any away
any privileges but I can easily see
creators now getting warnings when they
shouldn't do you mean like think so like
make it a open for me I think the I
think we need more clarification on
whether the warning can actually be
reset in any and in whatever
circumstance right because a warning a
warning is a good it's a good thing you
should bet and that's what a lot of
people have said give me a warning first
let me know that something has been done
that's outside of what should have been
done give me the chance to fix it or
whatever so if if that warning can be
rolled back if you dispute it is in the
same way that you would dispute a strike
mm-hm and then that warning can be reset
so it goes back to normal right then I
think that's a that's a reasonable
improvement right over the existing
system yes if that warning can be
spurious ly burnt up by somebody who's
like yeah an amazing I think the stuff
that you said about my may chant my
website right strike yeah made legal
team go after you yeah and then you're
like hey this is a bunch of BS and
YouTube's like you're right it's BS
right easier warning still gone that's
that's that's the core question this new
policy is this new change still subject
to abuse is this new does this cure the
abuse or is it still subject to the same
abuse that we've been experiencing
because because that that that you get a
warning buffer once it's burning once
it's burned up exposes you to what is
now a more harsh penalty system than
what existed before yeah
so hopefully YouTube will clarify that
I'd like there to be some
meant for people who issue fraudulent
strikes against channels and that is
equally if not more so punishable that
is the thing that a lot of us have been
saying come would happen is if somebody
uses the DMCA takedown procedure
erroneously as a history RP double
typing if they're if they're abusing
that then they should have some sort of
penalty you know you know they shouldn't
be able to do it anymore or something
like that and we'll see if that actually
ever happens who knows but anyway well
the other thing to mention here is that
they said they will also now be more
clear about communicating what caused
the strike so if you got your email that
was like you have a strike on your
channel now there be more information
they're not it's not specific what
additional information you'll be
provided but I'm sure we'll find that I
look forward to the next strike against
associated struck to find out yes
hey one more story to talk about here
this one's brief it's just a new product
which has a high watch it's a power
supply so high wattage Paris play better
max those are essential the max rivo
1800 watt that a lot of wattage look at
all the modular connectors on the back
of that mask wattage max rebo 1800 is an
1800 watt power supply with peak power
up to 1900 watts yeah housing depth is
only 180 millimetres 80 plus diamond
these pictures are super small it's
actually only 80 plus gold that was one
thing that I kind was like what I read
have expected a super high in power
supply there's like this to be platinum
then maybe there's a thing worth like
you go to this water just it's
impossible okay that probably has
something it's probably a trade-off with
the size of the housing because that's
one of the things they specifically said
was like yeah there's other high wattage
power supplies like this but none of
them that have 180 millimeter housing
they're usually like 220 or 230 or so
out of that gotcha so maybe it features
a high performance transformer a high
density PCB and fmq topology not that I
know what that means
fmq
it's for the muckin for your mother
father mucking quilts yes six powerful
12-volt rails 12 PCIe connectors there's
a turbo switch with a 3100 rpm max fan
and it's 80 plus gold rated not just all
the 80 plus cooperated but also 80 plus
230 volt EU gold rated so for a Europe
because honestly if you actually want to
get 1800 or 1900 watts out of this power
supply you certainly won't be using it
in the United States where we have a 115
volt power delivery system for normal
power you need 230 volt power delivery
for your 1800 watt connection if you're
in the US and you connect this power
supply up to 115 volt outlet you'll get
1600 watts out of it so there you go
it's got a 10 year warranty it's
available in late February 2019 and no
price has been listed so probably I
don't know three hundred bucks usually
like three hundred bucks what they
charge for something like this yeah
we'll see we'll see that's a lot of
money alright uh so much power that's
all we got for the tech news today we're
gonna we're gonna round out this half of
the show with some q and a's so we're
gonna answer some questions alright and
also gives some johnson shoutouts and in
just a few brief moments i can start
with the donations on my yeah let's do
this
alright so anyone who do any on my half
thank you very much we'll start with
Michael Ferrari Ferrari that's your last
name it's badass and you should be
driving a Ferrari with that last name
super badass mr. Ferrari your Prius is
ready for 99 great show great name and
donation thank you very much mr. Ferrari
I was just referred to you as mr. Frye's
no.1 robert f $6 66 cents rock on
brother
welcome back Kyle so glad you're back
and how level-headed you you have
handled the whole thing the whole strike
thing thanks Robert
you know I feel like you know you can
blow up the situation at times I was
blowing up internally but you know it
does matter how you present yourself
when you have an audience and
going out for the world to see I think
the main point was just spreading
awareness and trying to ensure that this
doesn't happen again
to my fellow friends and creators anyone
else who abides by fair use so thank you
very much
bazinga X $5 welcome back Kyle need to
get used to seeing you without glasses
you should sue the verge after all you
did not do the video Lyle did that is
true
my brother has gotten me in a lot of
trouble lately and it should be
addressed
perhaps in a future video maybe Kyle and
Lyle will finally meet in a single
solitary scene for you old witness who
knows who knows maybe maybe that that
joining of of two Mad Men will will
eventually break screen if you're lucky
enough I'd be cool i watch that you guys
actually like touch things like this it
was like a Dragonball Z thing or
something some energy a finger lotion or
something we can we turn Super Saiyan or
something exactly that's our super
racist Daryl made $10 hey guys what do
you guys think about the lightest thing
with carry any thoughts I think he might
be referring to the carry holzman
debacle that I briefly caught I don't
think that's what they're talking about
no copyright the the claims that he got
on his videos right I saw that video
from - Oh was it carried specifically
yes well that's what people in the
comments are speculating probably not
why I watched his video where he talked
about addressing the drama this one yes
someone linked a video to carry
Holtzman's video was that Carrie
Holtzman's video yes that Carrie
Holtzman apparently got seven different
like copy Content ID
copyright ID claims on his videos that
were all from when his tech tips oh I
didn't know is Carrie it was Carrie
Holtzman
okay I watched his livestream and
everything okay but apparently those
were automated from YouTube yeah and so
I think the live stream from Carrie was
kind of like a burden piece online it's
like how
could he do like he was he was
definitely pretty harsh on - when in
reality it seemed like this was all just
YouTube's broken automated system that
we've heard countless times of being
just really shitty so so it was a big
miscommunication that also put Linus
under a lot of heat that he addressed in
that video you just pointed out cleared
up a lot of things Linus is always very
good to like never mention any names
which kind of made it a little bit more
confusing at first but I eventually saw
the Carey holzman video and okay this is
probably what he was talking about
apparently there were some other people
involved other creators involved who had
gotten striked by YouTube in regards to
like copywriting Linus tech tips videos
that LTTE had no hand in according to
Linus so that's what Linus was dressing
so okay cuz I know it was something
about Unigine heaven benchmark footage
from a Linus video oh that had been
content aidid Wow into other videos so
as anyone who's running the Unigine
Heaven benchmark suddenly suddenly the
YouTube Content ID system thought that
belongs to Linus and was flagging other
videos says a lot about how the
algorithm thinks so based on what you're
saying and hopefully this is accurate
but Carey from his perspective getting
you know getting copyright claim
someone like Linus yeah but
understandably it be upset sure this
would probably have been a good
situation though going back to like hey
you should have contacted them first
right right he mean well he maybe could
have done something like that I don't
know what avenue of communication he has
opened with Linus because yeah you know
not everyone can just be like hey Linus
and get a response
Linus but yeah but Linus at the same
time you know if this is all automated
stuff that's happening in the background
probably had no idea that any of this
was going on until it was brought to it
his attention by this scandal video or
whatever so anyway yeah it's just this
all there's a lot of lessons to be
learned here
ask first you know less less just less
response and more communication I think
when you put a video out there for the
world to see it it just sends off this
whole like we live in a weird world a
weird world now where like you just make
a video you can post from your phone
whatever while you're in your car and
like the world sees it and it can it
just just fucking you know explodes like
just reach out to people first
you know like think about what you're
posting and how it could affect someone
like Linus employs 20-something people
you know you could have that was
actually the one of the one of the funny
things about it because at least from
the the Linus video that I watched was
he has multiple channels he was getting
content claims on tech quickie from his
Linus from Lion effectives yeah the you
learn is that the YouTube system is
broken and if you see something that you
know your copyright aidid or a Content
Aidid for from a different channel like
it might not be from that channel it
might just be YouTube screwing up
because YouTube is overwhelmed with
content that they just they can't
manually review everything at the moment
and so they try to automate everything
and we're not quite there yet automation
fucks everything up and people blame
other people for it when the autumn when
it's really just you know automation and
it just causes all this madness so you
know think twice before you upload
anything ask people talk communicate
communication communication hashtag
communication is just communication no
one's communicating everyone's just
doing acting and also it's like and and
the other fucked up thing is that like
YouTube also kind of glamorizes like the
drama you know YouTube really glamorizes
drama like you see drama videos like on
top 10 trending all the time and like I
feel like that's just become part of the
YouTube culture it's not about content
it's about like the most shock and awe
it's like you know like oh wow I could
create this Byrne piece on this big
content creator it's notable figure this
VIP and get like views at the same time
it's like a two-fold and I get all the
support
from my followers and whatever it's like
you know it's it's really crazy it's
weird when you think about it like
YouTube's kind of created this own
culture that also kind of burns itself
you know and and people are falling into
it without really thinking first they're
just like views views and ad revenue and
I don't know anyway yes all right uh
let's see
Anthony five dollars I'm sitting in the
hospital with pneumonia watching to my
favorites live glad all this bird stuff
is blowing you over keep keep up the
great work Thank You Anthony exam glad
it's all blown over too

was maybe a tweet someone was like first
I saw someone driving an Audi and I was
a kid like oh I'm sorry
I saw someone in my rearview mirror
behind me and I was like that looks like
Calif it way it wouldn't be funny if he
was driving an Audi and I pulled up
further and I was like it isn't Audi is
that Kyle from bit wit oh my god that's
come from it way it was which is really
funny I didn't I mean I didn't notice or
see anything I didn't see anyone like
waved to me or anything I've never had
anyone waved to me or stop me in a car
while driving like hey I'm a fan so
that's that's kind of funny but yeah

new member welcome cell processing what
does that mean I don't know what that
means so think so thank you very much
for being a new member yourself you know
you've really worked your way up the
ladder from being a new member as of ten

cooler master box pro 5 I think that has
yeah water cooling outside yeah you can
probably do it to 40 in there Azamat
that's a 5 light right there oh yeah the
5 light there's a building that I think
for pimp my rig actually yeah case ok

airflow there got some good static
pressure fans good for the rats good for
the fin stacks Jonah's $50 Wow Jonas
that's very generous of you thank you
stay awesome Kyle and please give Lyle
more screen
time hashtag rib stroke hashtag it's
wrong it's Jonas not Joanna's I would
not have mistaken that for we live in
America where the we have a group of
celebrities called the Jonas Brothers
people will yell at you if you don't
know how to pronounce their they're
doing a reunion they are oh well we're
going duh
and it's it's an American trying to
decide whether I should be embarrassed
by the fact that I knew that you should
be America Twitter or something right
there's somebody tweeted about it follow
on Twitter then it's just friends it was
just trends just shut up I it was
nothing to do about it
damn it yeah and khloe kardashian broke
up with her boyfriend
today you know I allegedly ting oh yeah
suspicions yes yeah and I only know that
because of Twitter trending it's like
even even is ending as isolated as I'd
like to be in our little it probably
Jordan right there toward in Chloe Chloe
Chloe she interested interest in Tom
Jordan split up over cheating
allegations says TMZ damn she should
have covered that in our news segment oh
like it could be only human could have
planned just like all the ladies all the
top tweets are about this that's just
welcome to society disappointing very
sad very sad let's hear about these
vapid people's relationships let's move
on to the next donation bazinga acts
twenty dollars thank you very much I
hate you Paul I hate you Paul J Greg and
Steve y'all motivated me to work on a
project this year
Oh Roger Skynet estimated to be 15 gray
I really send with love for y'all I will
tweet pictures will be done in six
phases Wow alright 15 grand
six phase PC I we need the pictures or
two the day bazinga
yeah we need pictures submit it to pay
my PC maybe yeah you send us pictures
you know assuming the six phases
conveniently line up with six awesome
Hardware episodes you know we could
probably do updates along the way or
something like
indeed for a 15 mm RPC I fact that be
worth it people want to see people want
to know what's what's gonna happen oh
yeah
Porter take it bazinga VMI's king
griffey $20.00 kind of get some help I
have an ACS r-tx 2018 it's not running
the way it should on rocket League I get
40 FPS all the game settings are set my
monitor is 240 Hertz I know nothing
about PCs this is my first build oh
you're getting really low performance on
your in broccoli rock that's a strange
that's very strange because you're
talking about 40 fps yes it's like if
you said 60 FPS available ceasing Sun
right 40 fps are you using integrated
graphics month are you using maybe art
is perhaps that could be Kyle
I would I would double check to see I
don't know if there's a setting in in
rocket League or maybe even just in your
well know if he's if he if he physically
plugged if he's if he knows nothing
about computers if it's an Intel build
this particular forty out and he just
plugged his video out into the
motherboard instead of the graphics card
you could possibly have defaulted to
that as a video out so plug your video
cable into your graphics card that's I
hope that's the answer because I'd be
really easy that was that would explain
the difference there yeah and everything
beyond that you you would maybe want to
download the latest Nvidia driver and do
a clean installation of it you know if
your drivers somehow got messed up when
they're installing for the first time
you could you could download download
ddu or display driver uninstaller you
need to restart in a safe mode with your
computer to clean your drivers and then
do a fresh install so that might help
out but it's not I think I think Kyle's
explanation there is Prout sounds like
the most reasonable for what you're what
you're getting there because 40 FPS you
should be getting way way way more than
that with the treatment in our GX 2080
yeah and that build quick quick and easy
fix I think though yeah good luck king
Nathan Sam's five Canadians no comment
just the money's thanks Nate's how we
like it
I'm just
appreciate bullshit your patronage give
me that money thanks Nathan
Karl Bennett $5 what is the best time to
submit hashtag pin my PC tweets
do you accept submissions before the
tweet goes out for pin my PC like the
day before I usually don't because I
usually get a lot of submissions so I'll
usually only look at the ones that are
submitted from the time that I tweet out
that the submissions are now open to the
time we start the show so your best bet
to get on pip my PC mm-hmm is to follow
Kyle on Twitter and keep an eye on it on
Tuesday
bit week out because it's because we
usually don't do show planning prior to
Tuesday correct it can happen as early
as 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning yeah
sometimes later in the day and you just
have to watch for Kyle because when he's
doing put my PC he'll be like hey guys
I'm doing put my PC and I'll tweet it
out yeah and then you'll just be one of
the people you'll want to be one of the
people to respond and if I may give
further advice like something should be
wrong with your computer yes if you've
got a bangin system I won't pick it if
your systems like hey everything is
immaculate like there's not much Nick
Regine what are we what are we going to
Cuttino material now that said now that
I've I've said this information publicly
like are we gonna have a rash of people
going in and like messing up their
computers so they can specifically get
em pepino so I can tell sometimes when
things don't sabotage your sabotage your
rig but it won't be as satisfying for
you anyway but but yeah generally
speaking I would say after 3:00 p.m. is
when I usually send out the tweet that
on Tuesdays Tuesday's after 3 p.m.
Pacific time is when I send out the
tweet hey tweet me pictures of your rig
because I don't because if I said it any
earlier than that then I have too many
submissions to sort through mm-hmm so
better than mine ok all right
and Phobos is my last donation here $10
thank you very much sir or ma'am missed
this hashtag can I see PC tweet but no
any a RGB or addressable RGB splitters
or hubs that'll work for me I have four
LED strips PC is in the desk but rog
maximus 10 hero only has one header
all of them through or sync okay the
question is there so one thing that I
know when it comes to addressable RGB
LEDs is that it will actually determine
the amount of addressable our jeebies
based on how many you have plugged in
and you can usually plug in multiple
strips especially if they're daisy
chained together yeah that will usually
work beyond that if you want a splitter
or hub that you will specifically know
will work with your aura sync because
you're gonna that's the thing with RGB
is like you can get a bunch of different
RGB stuff but if it's all sort of
handled by a different software right it
can be difficult to get it all to sync
up properly of different applications
since you've already invested in the
Asus Ora system then you probably want
their ASIS or RGB controller right which
I recently I recently yes they have one
I recently used it in my and my build
did it just come all the cart I hold on
I bet I can find it well then you're
really close to a million subscribers by
the way I know I'm close so close
everyone go subscribe to follow yes the
giveaway here it is never mind you have
eight that was a really cool bill but
there you put together yeah I mean I was
I felt kind of like matchy match you
with everything but at all at all turned
it all came together
mm-hm real nice where is it Swift I
thought I had it in here tylium Leith or
the Swift monitor wired mouse Flair
headset alright never mind it's nothing
yeah this is the giveaway video maybe
it's in the pre
why didn't that link the original build
video in the giveaway video because you
suck I know you're a terrible youtuber
here what are you looking for you are
looking for the are you looking for like
an asus horror sync controller hold on
I'm gonna find it I'm gonna find it
because I know it's there one of these a
ROG or a terminal oh right
there it is yes how does that work I
didn't use it RGB is such a pain in the
ass I didn't I didn't need it okay so
you were able to connect all the RGB
devices natively to the motherboard
without having to use that controller
yes how many how many RGB devices you
have other than the use all the headers
on the motherboard no no I mean I used
the headers on the motherboard but I was
able to use that headers on the
motherboard and I didn't need anything
else okay so this is probably three
maybe four headers webcam or a terminal
so there it is it actually looks pretty
nice - yeah looks clean it's got some
brushed metal on the outside and yeah so
you've got you've got five volt headers
in there alright so you can connect
multiple devices up yeah it's compatible
with the but the the asus rog
that's all I showed of it like I didn't
need it for the build like I had enough
headers on the motherboard and
everything to connect everything up
right so I just I just didn't need it
yeah that's really what it came down to
yeah but if you needed to add more stuff
and wanted it to be compatible at the
asus or a software that's what you
should get I guess the point of all that
sorry say what we're gonna look I got on
a tangent trying to find that so I think
we're on your donations now okay Gulf
City truckin bear with the five dollar
donation says I was wondering what do
you think I can do to bring my AMD
Athlon 2 x4 635 and my Asus m4 888 TD
dash V Evo USB 3 back from the dead and
gaming once more there's a lot you do
but it wouldn't be worth it yeah gold
city's checking barriers joy or you're
at a buying run an impasse there with
rising Hardware gets to a certain point
where it just can't keep up anymore and
you know where as I'm sure an Athlon 2x4
635 would be perfectly adequate for
certain stuff like web browsing and
probably video playback and stuff like
that if you want to get into gaming you
just need a CPU that can keep up with a
graphics card and you're gonna need a
reasonable graphics card to play modern
games something within the past three
four years x4 635 is I don't when when
did that come out Athlon and English 30
wait X 1 F on 2x4 630 508 paste in
search we have a pass mark mm-hmm seedy
world
January 25th 2010 was when I watched so
you're looking at a almost 10 years CPU
and not necessarily a high-end one when
it did launch it was only a hundred and
twenty bucks when it launched so yeah
spend 120 bucks on a CPU right now and
you can probably game with it but you'll
need updated memory and a motherboard as
well yeah sorry sorry we can't give you
too much more advice than that that's
that's so yeah great and there's some
games you could play on that they say I
mean if you wanna play older games or 2d
games or stuff it's not 3d rendered I
mean you're still fine but if you want
to do anything modern if you're gonna
play any of the battle royale game games
or whatever gonna need
upgrade yeah so processing why are you
doing $85 so we tell you that's no no he
said five dogs and he says hi Paul I
sell
thanks for yeah he's very lazy to pay
five dollars to tell me do you really
don't don't donate does he look like an
expensive just say she bazinga X $25
donation
he says congrats on soon-to-be dad thank
you visiting X I kind of announced that
in my recent Hawaii video if you guys
didn't watch that all the way through to
the end that was the announcement again
yeah that was our babymoon my wife is
very pregnant we're due in late April
super pregnant thank you very much for
the donation he says your thoughts on
the rampage six extreme Omega
motherboard it's a really high-end asus
motherboard for high end Intel platform
yeah but that's the one I'm using for
know our you know cuz your do you know
anything 394 yeah thinking I haven't
looked at too many of the details of
that but you know Asus usually goes all
out although now you can compare it to
their Dominus extreme which is
apparently 1600 or 1800 dollars so now
nothing is crazy overpriced even 400 or
$500 motherboards cuz it's not the
Dominus extreme right it's all all a
matter of you know you don't need it
Carl Hall with the $10 Canadian donation
I was too lazy to donate on cows half
and he plans on adding floatplane
swimming for awesome hardware very
classy not immediately I would like to
get on a float plane at some point here
you've been saying that for years
but it's that's all me it's all up to me
it's me it's been delaying that have you
you'll get there live stream flow plane
yeah works I haven't done it in a couple
months but it's I was talking to Lou
King says it's supposed to be even
better now is it integrated with with
xsplit I don't know about that okay they
need to get that worked at one day thank
you though Carl we
Sal duchi with $5 donation
congratulations on the pregnancy thank
you very very much Guido he says I'd
like to point out that Guido is a very
fine name for a child it has a long
history in my family
well Guido since we've already told a
few people I guess we can reveal this
here as well it's a girl
so I don't we don't I don't know if
Guido would wait even better would quite
line up you just call her we have each
we have gotten many many suggestions
numerous all duchi yeah so dude hey
Bobo's with the $10 donation
hey guys sending another super chat I'm
Paul's half cause loving both him want
to support equal thank you very much
Phobos heyo
we very much appreciate that and the
super shots are always super there
including that one right space guy with
a $5 donation do you guys think the
performance increase from using a
Samsung QV o 4 terabyte would be worth
using and raid over a WD black 4
terabyte I mean if you're talking about
a Samsung Evo like an SSD yes that would
be way way faster than a WD black for a
terabyte SSD yeah if you're talking
about a WD black nvme SSD the Samsung's
a little bit faster then than Western
Digital but the big question there is
whether you're talking about a WD black
hard drive or a WD black sounds like
hard drive
it sounds like hard drive because of the
capacities he's talking about now don't
even think they make a WD black yea SSD
but hopefully that helps yeah Mike again
been b67 13 dollars and 37 cent donation
he says Paul congrats to you and mrs.
Paul Harbor thank you very much I will
convey that to her as well
also I enjoyed seeing your Hawaii travel
blog it makes me kind of miss living in
Hawaii Cheers I did not know you lived
in Hawaii that's pretty great Mike lives
in in San Diego right now which is not
too shabby at all no he if you follow
him on Twitter he posts pictures of the
sunset over
the ocean and it's often quite beautiful
I'm gonna crash your pad one of these
days Mike that's a good idea so you know
it's good our San Diego trips can get
out of hand though so just just
forewarned before 1:00 but come for you
rotten Cairo with the $10 donation says
congratulations pop of Paul thank you
very much one Papapa I am I am
absolutely Dani Paul I am it's
completely scared I'm so afraid you will
help raise your child
Oh Greco Gaming $10 donation is it worth
it to buy rise in 2000 CPU series right
now or wait for the rise in 3000 series
I'm gonna Oh grok oh yes go ahead that's
that's tough to say chances are we've
got at least four months before the 3000
series comes out oh that's beautiful
so if you need a computer right now then
go for the rise in 2000 series if you
feel you can wait then until you know
June or July then wait I hope that helps
Chris W $5 donation says long live Lyle
I don't think Lyle is going anywhere
anytime soon so Lyle shall live on trust
me
Steven Bolton $5 donation hey guys I
have to 2080s in Envy link it doesn't
look like Nvidia is going to optimize it
for games
should I sell them for it's won a atti
if you want more graphics performance
yes yeah just
like in certain situations to 2080s in
an optimized game would probably
outperform a 28 ETA but how many
optimized games are you gonna find for
two-way SLI even not very many so yeah
you'd be you'd be in a better situation
with a single 28 ETA even with the
ridiculous price of it versus 228 es des
Jones with a $10 donation here's some
green for you guys Cal I got your back
pray get your justice I think Kyle has
been has had a good amount of justice so
far things have fortunately gotten
fairly positively since the initial
disappointment of the of the strike and
everything so thank you des Jones and
we'll we'll keep things positive
Gabriel Greer with the $5 donation
debating getting a 28 ETI or a 2080 I
have a 1080 right now 1440p 144 Hertz
monitor found a used 2084 700 bucks
which seems like a good deal is it worth
it can you get new 2080s for 700 bucks
that seems I thought that was the case I
mean that's 180 TI is such a big bump in
price you're talking another 300 to 500
dollars depending on what 2080 are
looking at so I'd say yeah 2080 would be
a more reasonable upgrade for you I mean
looking at the 2080 TI is always
tantalizing but you know especially
since you're upgrading from a 1080 what
I feel bad about is the people who are
considering upgrading from a 1080 Ti to
a 2080 because then you're going from 11
gigs of memory down to 8 gigs which I
know which which kind of sucks but you
shouldn't that's a sight great anyway
Gabriel I hope that helps Gerald with a
$50 donation Thank You gerald hey yo Cal
sadly your store is out of stock of XL
heavy sweatshirts and oh I missed your
half of the show off to restock those so
here's the money I'm giving to Paul to
give to you
Gerald thank you for the money I'm not
giving it to Kyle I know how it works
I appreciate you guys
ass work you put in do what you do
cheers fellas jail I'm gonna do this
slowly so path employers beer cheers
right back at you
what are you can't cheers on a cup that
empty okay and I'm driving so you have
told me no thank you
cheers Cheers Thank You job
thanks for giving up all my money
appreciate it James Brule
with the $10 donation I have a gtx 1066
gig and wanting to upgrade can you give
me a recommendation for a budget
I was thinking a 2060 alright James a
2060 will cost you three hundred and
fifty dollars and if you're gonna spend
$350 in a graphics card that's what you
should get yeah good call
I would agree that's benefits there's
there's not a whole lot of debate in
that area right now it's like the new
seven it's it's it's gonna significantly
up significantly is a relative term but
it's gonna outperform in like in an RX
590 or the best you can get on the AMD
side oh yeah
it's oh yeah for the money you're not
gonna beat it with them with the Vega 56
or 64 and you're cooked for like 1440p
gaming yeah so that's how you should go
for if you're gonna do anything James
maybe wait for like just assigned a few
days for a few days just I mean you know
something we don't Paul no I'm not I
don't know anything else is completely
arbitrary and not associated with
anything but James if you're gonna do
anything when it comes to assess the
assessing your your your purchase right
now maybe just Jamie just think on it
for a few days
oddly suspicious of you right now I
think we all are and even after a few
days there's a very good chance it will
come to the same conclusion I'm just
saying a you know a few days and maybe
more and more shit will come to light no
comment
cuz that's all I'm saying Oscar a with a
$5 donation Eli the computer guy makes
it a point for content creators to move
away from YouTube as a platform how do
you feel about creating your own
platform Oscar the closest to that we
have is float plane right now Kyle's
currently involved with that I am in
favor of there being alternatives to
YouTube because I don't think there
should be a single source of video
contents
I don't think Amazon should be the
single source of buying stuff online
monopoly it's not gonna know there needs
to be diversity in that it needs to be
to be competition so I am all in favor
of that I don't have any plans or in the
future immediate future to completely
abandon YouTube no I would be okay to
diversify and post content on multiple
platforms why not both alternatives are
good but I completely although I don't
know all the details I sympathize and
understand the Eli's stance on deciding
he doesn't want to deal with YouTube
anymore because when you're burned by a
platform it's hard to regain that trust
yeah and you know and when the Lyle Virg
video got taken down it was still up on
float plane there you go
you can still watch it if you were a
float plane can subscriber hope that's
where they're clear as day want freedom
fucking freedom nice be there slogan to
dividend for Wolff --mess with the $25
donation Kyle you had to build a PC
video was the main inspiration for me
ever building a PC as bad as it turned
out lol just replied to me with it is
that is that my fault that it turned out
thank you no I said lol sorry thank you
for all you're doing Congrats on the new
home thank you very much I can't wait to
share with you guys in a future vlog
actually several vlogs I'm curious I
want to yeah well it's weird the end
wait in there you know I get to stop by
next week okay let me know we'll be
streaming from not too far as did you
come here from there today no I went to
my grandparents place for okay I had to
pick up some stuff but sorry I can't
tell you I can tell you on the way home
alright tonight how long it takes me to
get there yeah to figure that out
Daniel g13 dot 37 cents with the leap
don't
nation I'd super check more but just
send a hundred dollars to the e FF for
something positive that's another really
really solid charity donation EF f it's
good it's good Thank You Daniel Beth and
I'm very glad that you had 1337 left
over after your hundred dollar donation
good on you though sir I hope you also
tweeted that out to to gamers Nexus with
D something positive
hashtag hell yeah I fly by you with five
dollar donation front mount or top mount
360 M one and a fractal are six which
would be more efficient front houses
friends I say front callouses front
front I've done the testing if you test
if you put it in front you will have a
cooler CPU and a warmer GPU if you put
it in top you'll probably have a cooler
GPU and a warmer CPU but you'll have a
more you'll have a hotter CPU if you
mount to the top because your GPU will
exhaust unless you have an enclosed
shroud GPU it'll exhaust more hot air
into your cases but a CPU radiator will
that's why in hey it's what I just said
I said if you put it in top of your CPU
will be warmer right but I'm saying the
degree of how much warmer it will be
will be greater with hot air ejected
from your GPU
than hot air ejected from your CPUs AO
radiator therefore men on you to the
front I don't I don't know that you can
that that can be stated universally I
think if you have an equivalent an
equivalent amount of heat being
generated by your CPU and your GPU and
both situations the question would be
how much is the higher running
temperature going to affect your CPU
versus your GPU and I think in some
situations granted it's gonna depend on
the case depending on the game you're
playing and depend on the test that
you're running depending on your air
flow ambient temperature lots of
different factors but I think that a
higher temperature on your GPU would
cause it to throttle
more versus a higher temperature on your
CPU because higher CPUs tend to be able
to maintain their frequency at
temperatures going up to like 90 degrees
it again depends on the situation so
well the example you just said is you
said assuming that CPU and GPU were
pumping out the same amount of heat in
that case yeah not the same amount of
heat but a fixed amount of heat I've
just found that your GPU radiates a lot
more heat in your case then then what I
felt coming off of like an overclocked
8700 K off of a 240 millimeter radiator
where there's a significantly more
amount of heat that your GPU is putting
out on like a semi and like a semi open
shroud card then then your CPU radiator
is your CPUs a i/o radiator that's just
my experience though so what I would say
for a flyby you you're asking about
efficiency I don't think that three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator is
any more efficient installed in the
front are installed in the top it's a
matter of how it affects the ambient
temperature and the temperature of the
other components in your computer and
how it affects their performance as
you're doing what you want to do which
is why I have said because I answered a
very similar question to this in my Q&amp;amp;A
video last month that the only way you
can actually determine is to test it for
yourself in your own specific
environment doing what you're doing with
it that never hurts yeah sometimes you
might have a better setup in the front
sometimes you might have a better setup
in the top ok I'm only speaking from
personal experience not like Universal
this is how it is I'm just saying from
the testing I've done it makes more
sense to put it the ready your CPUs area
radiator at the front but that's that's
not a blanket statement so like Paul
said test it for yourself every system
is different ok zero chance was to $20
donation thank you very much good to see
you guys back have some beer or whatever
you want on me thanks and thanks for
answering my previous super Jets you're
very welcome
JD was a $10 donation what fellas yeah
you're right Kyle sorry you went through
that shit but it's sort of funny Paul
had your back too funny it was I've
never seen Paul mad but in his video he
was upset what a pal what it all ended
well yeah I could get I can get more
angry but you know oh yeah so those
pretty pretty easy tame Paul standard uh
you haven't seen him like I've seen it
you knew me back when I worked at nerd
and there I just get mad on a regular
basis cuz you worked for a corporation
it worked at a regular like nine-to-five
job gives you worked for like a Virg
tech company yeah exactly
but anyway Thank You JD and bad old days
I was I was happy to see people yeah
getting cows back there helped quite a
few people who who posted about it so
that's awesome
Jay Bell with the $10 donation my wife
broke my new mug I bought from Kyle that
I use every day no that's so sad
no they just ordered me a new one oh
that's good we should start offering mug
insurance our wife insurance on our
stores it's a good idea wife insurances
wanted to thank her and ask if you can
thank her for her support of the channel
she's the real MVP Oh Oh his wife but
she all right so his wife broke the mug
and then she ordered him a new one a new
one so the Jays wife well done you are
the MVP thank you for replacing Jays mug
that you broke I'm sure it wasn't
intentional
and you should get one for yourself as
well yes yes everyone should JD was
another $10 donation need to upgrade my
s340 elite case and want more air flow
was looking at the lane cool one the
mesh if I see and the NZXT age 700 grats
on the bball oh right what will arrive
first your baby is HTPC Jake a
much-loved JD I will have an update
video on the HTPC before the baby but I
cannot promise that the htpc will be
finished before the baby
which one will be birthed first the
labeling debate I mean what what it's
the phrasing is difficult to the parts
thing you know thank you though JB and
