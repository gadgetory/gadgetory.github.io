welcome back to probing Paul my monthly
Q&amp;amp;A video that I do this is episode
number 15 and I'm going to be answering
your questions that were primarily asked
in last month's video probing call
number 14 as you can see right here I'll
link that down in the video's
description if you want to go back into
the history of questions that have been
asked of me and you know figure out what
my answers to them work so without
further ado let's just jump right into
it for today again mostly these were
taken from last month's video I thought
at least one other besides that first
question is from Nicolas reef who asked
this wasn't a question
this was a follow-up to last month which
the title was how to get rid of or sell
old PT parts and I neglected to mention
the subreddit Hardware swap and Nicolas
pointed this out and quite a few people
actually uploaded his comments so thanks
plenty of guys who did that basically on
that reddit Hardware saw Hardware swaps
subreddit you can go on people post up
there selling depending on the location
you're at and that kind of thing
I actually haven't bought anything
directly off of here although I have
browsed it before but it's a great way
to find some good deals
bear in mind that's apparently according
to some of the other commenters if
you're selling stuff there there's a
tendency for people to try to lowball
you with the prices that they're
offering and everything but made a
little bit more direct method of finding
some hardware that's available in your
area without having to go through
something like eBay or you might have to
pay extra fees or deal with the shady
return policies or that kind of thing
the next question was actually asked in
the last night's awesome hardware and I
saw this in chat and I'm sorry I didn't
get a chance to screencap it or see who
actually asked it but I've been asked
this before as well but it's where do
you get your Lord of the Rings t-shirts
I'm wearing I'm wearing one of these
right now this is my n smooch maple
Meade shirt basically I have like three
of these shirts my wife got them for me
basically they're they're all like Lord
of the Rings themed beers and kind of
shirts with that which which thought
felt pretty appropriate for me but
they'll come from tee fury so if you go
to tee fury and search for Lord of the
Rings you can find this page where they
have lots of Lord of the Rings themed
t-shirts two of the three that I have
aren't available anymore I have this
green dragon logger one right here and
then I also have the
ministerios whitetail I believe and then
of course my maple Mead there's also a
Mirkwood merlot apparently but that's
not beer I mean there's nothing wrong
with wine but just not beer but that's
where I got them again they might not
also be available for for sale but if
you guys want to check it out maybe
they'll bring them back at some point
next question is from Ellis frost what
are the best ways to get into working
with pcs I've applied to a few stores
but haven't been accepted I'd love to be
a system builder or somehow get a job
doing benchmarks rather than as a Sales
Advisor any suggestions this is a very
good question and I get asked quite a
bit because lots of people kind of want
to do the type of thing that I do
because it's a it's a really cool job as
I'm not going to deny that I really like
making YouTube videos about technology
it's a difficult market to break into my
recommendations for you would be first
off make sure you have a solid
foundation of knowledge of what you're
talking about when it comes to the PC
hardware if that's what you're focused
on several responses to this question
last month also point out that getting
some certifications could be a way to
get yourself up getting A+ certified or
getting Network or security
certification I like the real world
experience though the hands-on stuff so
definitely spend as much time as you can
just doing what you do is a hobby
try to get your hands on as much
computer parts as possible will help out
people building systems because the more
you work with it the more familiar you
will be with it but more realistically
if you're looking at something
entry-level I would look at companies
that are already established that work
in this market I started at Newegg doing
something completely unrelated to what I
eventually did there doing the YouTube
channel but because I was interested in
computers I was able to kind of work my
way through up to a couple couple
different positions to end up doing what
I what I ended up doing I definitely say
check out the review sites that are out
there because there's lots of review
sites of varying sizes that will often
hire out third parties as independent
contractors to write stories for them
and I'll often be able to send you apart
or something to take and do a review on
or something like that that could be a
good way to kind of get your foot in the
door start to get yourself noticed and
then of course start to learn the
industry a little bit more because it's
really not that huge of an industry when
it comes to technology and computers in
general but hopefully those are a few
sort of starting out tips that could
help you along on your way overall I
would say definitely make sure you have
a good grasp of communication skills
because that's very important whether
you're talking or whether you're
writing you need to be able to use the
proper words to get your point across as
far as what you're saying and there's
really no solution for that and I feel
like as I talked about being able to
speak well I should use better words to
describe that but that's that's okay
let's move on
you're our proxy your proxy says I have
a rise in seven 1700 is it a bad idea to
buy a GTX 1074 1440p 75 Hertz gaming I'm
assuming I would say no it's not at all
a bad decision in fact the GTX 970 is
considered by many to be the absolute
ideal sweet spot GPU for 1440 they're
also 75 Hertz so you're not gonna have
to worry about hitting a really high
frame rates but um 1070 should easily
get you by and I would even say like I
mean obviously if you go for a 1080 but
I wouldn't even bother 1070 is perfect
and I've recommended it many many times
for 1440 gaming again especially at the
refresh rate that you're looking at next
up is radioactive Phoenix with Acer and
Asus having upcoming monitors that are
4k HDR and 144 hurts what GPU do you
think would be required to achieve those
specs I imagine to push a game at 4k
resolution 144 frames per second average
or minimum ideally what a gtx 980ti be
enough so just to show you guys what
radioactive phoenix is talking about
here Acer just recently announced the
predator X 27 a 4k HDR hundred forty
four grits g-sync monitor the ultimate
gaming monitor Asus has a monitor and
the works as well with these very
similar specs we're anticipating is
probably based on the same panel now I'm
sort of giving a broad answer here
because I'm not saying here are the
benchmarks that show this or that a 1080
TI will be adequate is what I would say
obviously it's going to greatly depend
on what game you're playing if all you
want to do is play csgo at 4k 144 Hertz
you're probably going to be just fine
even with less than a 1080 Ti but you
got to play the newest triple-a titles
with max the you know eye candy and all
the special effects turned on at full
resolution with 144 frames per second
1080i even it's probably not going to
cut it depending again on the situation
in the game that's being played you
would probably be looking at a two-way
1080 TI solution for something like this
if you really wanted to maximize the
game performance but realistically it's
probably going to be the type of thing
that you just don't use to its full
potential until another generation of
GPS come out that can handle that
high-resolution a little bit more easily
because 4k even though it's been around
for a few years now it's still very
difficult to push a game at 4k
especially if it is a high-end game
but thank you so much for that question
radioactive phoenix simple question here
from max fox ultra wide or 4k for gaming
a simple answer ultra wide is what i
would say right now reasons being 4k I
think is a little bit better for
productivity 4k is harder to push as
we've already discussed there's more
pixels in 4k even then in an ultra wide
like the h3 predator x34 I have back
here 34 40 by 1440 you get more more
pixels than they would with 1080 or even
1440 you get a wide screen which is I
think a bit more immersive and fantastic
for gaming and again you don't need
quite as much GPU horsepower to push it
so that's what I'd go for even the 2560
by 1080 ultra wives I think are a great
solution for getting into that market in
that way of gaming without having to
spend a ton of money lmf Gauri asks hey
Paul I have a pretty old motherboard and
an 8300 and SX 8300 should upgrade to
the rise inside for 1080p gaming only
lms go and as Gauri I say yes right now
is the time to upgrade your FX based
system the FX series launched in like
2011 so they're like 6 and the
architecture used in them is even older
than that six or seven years old so yeah
I demonstrated in my Rison seven launch
video that when you're playing on even
an overclocked 8350 it really hurts
performance even at 1080 so you're going
to get a nice boost especially if you're
pairing it with a decent graphics card
and the Rison 5 lineup is is really nice
right now and you get a lot of bang for
your buck I'd say go for the rise in 5
1600 ad overclock it's that's that's my
suggestion swap swap no chip odd ask
what happened to your giveaway I'm not
going to win but still I've gotten this
question quite a bit over the last month
so I wanted to address it here very
briefly my giveaway ended there here's
my tweets back at the beginning of April
average I first picked the u.s. $1000
USD cash winner
went to Peter from Vienna
Austria he claimed that really quickly
set that over to him I picked the
domestic winner
his name was Logan and he didn't follow
up he didn't respond to me in time so I
ended up picking a new winner who wait
where you go new winner is Matt he's
from Scottsdale Arizona he claimed it
right quick and actually if you guys are
curious Logan did get back to me
eventually and I'm going to be sending
him a sweatshirt from my store one of my
hoodies just as a consolation prize
because he was disappointed obviously
but he was also very reasonable about it
Matt who did win actually since I
donated on awesome Hardware last night
and gave us an immature link which I
neglected the show on the show but I
wanted to show here here is the RGB
build in its new home he's actually done
some building and reconfiguration he's
upgraded it's got like seven terabytes
of storage in it now he moved the liquid
cooler from the front to the top but as
you can see he's got a really cool
looking kind of flame looks like fiery
color scheme going on right now and
there's his full setup that he sent a
picture of too so very glad that it went
to Matt because he was super cool
actually I didn't even send him all the
pieces that for the case I missed out on
some of the accessories he got in touch
with fan techs and they replaced those
for him so that was very cool fan text
as well so that was a really cool
giveaway and I'm glad the Matt when it
and of course apologies to any of you
guys who didn't win but at the Memphis
final question from Jordan asks he says
I love you Paul would you like to spoon
with a 35 year old 65 to 70 pound
italian-american man Manoah big guy but
I would be gentle Jordan I'm intrigued
obviously I'm married so I got to take
that into account but you know what
there's nothing mentioned here besides
spooning that could be purely platonic
and you know it just it feels like it
would be warm and and it would like it
would feel safe so I'm not going to say
no I'll leave it at that but guys that's
all for this video this episode of
probing follow thanks so much for all
the questions that have been submitted
I'll be doing this again next month so
if you have any more questions as to
leave them in the comment section down
below of course if you're down there and
you want to take a gander at the
description I've got some links to some
of the stuff I've talked about today as
well as the thumbs up button if you want
to like the video as always appreciate
it helps me out a lot thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see
