last night I had a chance to attend a
press conference held by AMD where they
discussed some further details about Zen
their brand new CPU microarchitectures
that is much anticipated they've been
working on it for quite some time and
according to the CEO Lisa Hsu and the
CTO mark paper Master Zen is a brand new
of course completely built from the
ground up and they are focusing on a few
different things
re-establishing themselves in the gaming
market which they've already done a
pretty big push recently with Radeon
Side immersive platforms such as VR as
well as reestablishing themselves in the
data center now md had some very
specific goals was then they wanted to
be able to design high-performance
desktop CPUs as well as mobile CPUs for
laptops notebooks they also included
better branch prediction in the
architecture micro-operation cache
instruction level parallelism 75% more
scheduling capacity and 50% more
scheduling with and execution resources
all this information of course is
provided directly by AMD we haven't been
able to do any independent testing
ourselves so grain of salt but what they
have shown is pretty impressive they've
added an 8 megabyte l3 cache they've
given five times the improvement in
cache capacity and bandwidth they've
introduced SMT simultaneous
multi-threading which simply put is
basically Intel hyper-threading but done
by AMD this will allow the CPUs to take
advantage of downtime and unused clock
cycles by allowing the operating system
to identify to actual threads for each
individual core it's based on 14
nanometer FinFET design and they are
touting 50% higher frequency using the
same power at least at the ideal point
on the frequency power curve efficiency
they say was a goal from the ground up
and according to what they're telling us
it's pretty damn impressive
40% performance gain versus excavator
which is their last iteration of their
previous architecture using the same
energy per cycle guys that is a really
impressive performance game and
efficiency is incredibly important
whether you're talking about notebooks
or data center use so that is a really
nice spec the actual CPU that they're
showing off is codenamed summit ridge
this is an 8 core 16 thread CPU based on
am 4 platform which is the new platform
for these CPUs ddr4 PCI Express gen3 and
next gen io which were not exactly sure
what it is but probably Thunderbolts and
nvme support for example they didn't
just tell aspects though they actually
showed us a side-by-side performance
demonstration using blender to render a
scene versus Broadwell II so this is
what we can assume as the 6900 K which
is also an 8 core 16 thread chip both
CPUs were clocked at 3 gigahertz so they
had the same amount of cores and the
same frequency and basically they're
showing us that with the same clocks and
the same number of threads the summit
ridge chip actually outperformed
Broadwell lead just by a hair maybe a
second or two margin but again really
impressive if Xen is on par on an
instructions per clock level with
Broadwell II that is impressive
now we're told that the actual frequency
for summit ridge cpus is expected to be
higher than 3 gigahertz but good to know
it can at least do that hopefully
preferably more and then the TDP was the
final question that is still unknown
we're told it's very competitive but
they're not giving specifics yet now
there's a new chipset for summit ridge
we don't know too many details about it
other than that next gen IO comments but
they actually had machines up and
running so even though these are really
really early samples that are pretty
much mocked up just to do demonstrations
and testing green PCBs all that stuff it
was cool to finally see an a.m. for
motherboard in person they also
introduced Naples which is their server
platform they had a motherboard
demonstrating that look kind of like an
ATI motherboard for some reason but two
processors on that so we should expect
to see some nice performance hopefully
on the server side as well and then they
had some demos going on so they were
showing Zen plus a VR using an RX 480
they had a gaming demo they were playing
Dave's x-man kind of divided at 4k using
Zen with a fury X workstation demo with
a Radeon Pro duo that was just kind of
there to see it they didn't really do
anything with it and then of course that
to processor server which just it's it's
cool-looking
I know it's a server system but I
thought it was pretty cool looking
anyway they're expecting to roll out
these chips at least the summit ridge
that they teased at the end of 2016
possibly a small launch at the end of
2016 but they're promising us them by q1
of 2017 at the latest we should expect
Zen notebooks by the second quarter of
2017 and we should expect the Naples
platform to start rolling out in the
second quarter of 2017 there's still
some questions rolling around TDP of
course is a big one we need to know
much power these CPUs are actually
drawing and that still remains to be
seen though and then I asked if they
were planning to have any m4 mini ITX
motherboards because that's something
we've been missing from the mainstream
platform for AMD for a while they said
most likely I don't know probably they
said we'll have them available in a wide
variety of form factors which I took to
mean probably but they don't want to
absolutely confirm that yet anyway guys
I hope you've enjoyed this video if you
did hit the thumbs up button thanks for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
