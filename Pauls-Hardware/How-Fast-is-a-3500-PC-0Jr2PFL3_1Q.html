Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be all about testing and benchmarking
this $3500 PC that I built just a couple
weeks ago in my August builds video now
every month I do some builds at the
beginning of the month and then I build
the system and then I test it and
although this system came in a little
bit late because I was waiting around to
get a hold of this corsair air 740 case
i have gone through all of the motions
to get some benchmarks run some
temperature testing some overclocking of
course and don't worry if you're looking
forward to the slightly less expensive
build that I'm doing for September that
will be coming in about a week or so
have lots of builds going on in
September actually but this is the
$3,500 over-the-top sli 2-way 1080s it's
got a 68 50k processor in there Asus x99
deluxe 2 motherboard 2 EVGA GTX 1080 for
the win cards in SLI and then I actually
left out the hard drives for this build
so if you look at the parts list in the
description it adds up to about three
thousand three hundred fifty dollars
right now if you buy it in the US of
course apologies to those of you who are
paying higher prices outside of the US
but this is for high-end gaming
productivity as well you shouldn't do
something like this if you're just going
to be gaming on it because it's
definitely overkill you should go with
something more along the lines of the
$1200 system that I built last month so
check that out - link is in the
description let's start off with what I
liked about this build and of course
what I've been trying to do with these
builds that I do every month is make
them all off-the-shelf unless I'm doing
something that's more specifically for
modding everything that you see here
came in the boxes with all of the
hardware that I installed I also like
that the color scheme came together
black and white of course is fairly
simple but everything blends nicely it's
not too gaudy over the top got the LEDs
from the fans sort of illuminating
everything and then there are GB options
of course with the graphics card and
motherboard as well I have air-cooled
GPUs which is a little bit simpler than
going with liquid cooling I do have
liquid cooling on the CPU had pretty
good overclocking with the system
especially in the CPU the GPUs we're
decent but again they're air-cooled and
there's two of them so there's a lot
more heat generated by both of those and
then of course there's just the pure raw
power of this build with two-way 1080s
in the 1668 50 X 668 50k
it's pretty beastly when it comes to
performance and I'll show you that of
course in just a moment and what I
didn't like about this build first off
was the RGB LED lighting control
software situation now granted this is a
little bit my fault because I'm dealing
with the Corsair software the software
for the EVGA graphics cards was
controlled through precision XO c and
then the asus software which has the AI
suite for overclocking and stuff but
also the aura suite or the aura software
which is specifically for control and
RGB LEDs now when I reviewed the Asus
x99 deluxe - just about a month ago I
did comments on the updated version of
the software and how they add integer to
introduce some more features however I
encountered some stability problems this
time around which was a little
frustrating getting the software even to
load became a problem and in fact I
would have to turn the system off and
turn the power to the system off and
wait for something in the memory to
clear out of the capacitors to flush
their power just to get the aura
software to load again so if you're
having that same issue turning your
system off and turning the power off can
get it to happen or to fix but downside
to that is that when you turn the power
off you actually lose your RGB profiles
that you might have set up so that's
kind of a pain in the butt - there are
some default LEDs that are on the
motherboard that stay on all the time so
if you were to for instance set the
system up and priests in like a dorm
room and you're you know in your room
where you sleep and you wanted to have
all the LEDs off at night you'd have to
turn the power switch off then you lose
your profiles and it's just not quite
ideal so I think aura software needs a
little bit more work a little bit more
tweaking and tuning the EVGA precision X
software as well gets the job done
there's just not a lot of different
lighting options that are available and
you have to individually select each GPU
before you go into the LED software
control so you can't sync them and
control them both at the same time for
that reason even getting the pulsating
color-changing stuff with the EVGA cards
was a little bit more difficult to get
synched up although you could sync it up
by timing it or just setting it that way
and then restarting the computer and
then everything would be kind of synced
up after that point being that if you
really want that full RGB LED control
either a make sure you're not mixing up
your brands so maybe go with the Asus
GTX 10
the EVGA so you can use the same
software for everything or just maybe
not be so worried about the RGB LEDs or
just give it a little bit more time
because obviously there's still a little
bit of a work in progress on all sides
speaking of software though one of the
first things I did was load up the Asus
AI Suite software which will allow you
to do the 5 way optimization the
one-click
automatic overclocking fan tuning
especially the fans I wanted to get
tuned right out of the gates and
overclocking I also wanted to check out
but had a little bit of a weird
situation with the auto overclocking it
was shall we say aggressive
five foot two
though no
my fur Byford
why not six six point one we're done
unite folks shutting her down so the
Asus AI Suites tried to overclock my 68
50 K 2 / 6 gigahertz which was a little
aggressive even though the corsair h 100
i v2 is a very well performing
closed-loop cpu cooler that's just a
little bit more than anyone should find
reasonable unless you're using liquid
nitrogen or something like that so i had
to go back into the bios and reload
optimized defaults and then i went in
and did the old-school manual method did
a simple multiply overclock got myself
to 4.4 gigahertz was running at one
point to nine volts and i find that to
be a lot more reasonable than 6.1
gigahertz i will say that the fan expert
software did work admirably though and
it automatically set up the fan profile
a it reaches out to all the fans sees
their minimax feed set up some automatic
profiles for them and then it gives you
a little widget that you can click to do
a silence or a standard or a performance
fan curve and I was going with silent
most of the time which is what you're
hearing right now or maybe not hearing
it's very quiet although I did jump up
to performance when I was doing the full
bore GPU testing speaking of though
let's move on to that overclocking
temperatures of noise which I kind of
already teased with my CPU overclock
again 4.4 gigahertz 1.2 9 volts
overclocked both of the GPUs using the
EVGA precision XOC utility I will say
that if you're overclocking a graphics
card and you then go for a 2-way set up
you might notice that you're not going
to get quite the same overhead with one
or with two cards that you might expect
with one so I only was able to tack on a
plus 45 GPU offset and a plus 200 memory
offset that's offset from the already
overclocked specs from the EVGA geforce
of course and that got me to 1766 base
clock 19:05 boost when I was actually
gaming after spiking up to in the mid
2000 Range I was getting about 2025
megahertz and then did throttle back
down to about 1995 so right around the 2
gigahertz range for both GPUs which is
perfectly acceptable for something like
this CPU temperatures while overclocked
at idle worth 29 to 32 degrees Celsius
about 71 degrees Celsius while gaming on
the CPU and 84 degrees Celsius when I
actually ran the stress test and of
course
as overclocked 4.4 gigahertz GPU
temperatures at alar 50 degrees Celsius
and that was with the fan off mode
that's by default with the EVGA cards 86
degrees C was what I hit max on the top
GPU that was under a full unit in heaven
benchmark gaming load and that was the
most I ever saw when I was actually
doing most of the games is hovering more
around 79 degrees Celsius for the top
card so the hottest card while gaming
under a more moderate gaming load so
definitely some very decent overclocking
however the alternative to the higher
speeds and frequencies and performance
you get with overclocking is more noise
right now I have Unigine Heaven running
full speed and everything is overclocked
and it is not the quietest experience
I've ever had with a computer it's not
too bad considering we have overclocked
hardware and a couple 10 80s in there
side panel does block a decent amount of
the noise
let's move into some testing first off
3dmark fire strike extreme I got 16,000
331 overall and 19,000 852 for the
graphics core fire strike ultra score
was nine thousand thirty two overall and
nine thousand five hundred and ninety
two on the graphics and for 3d mark time
spy the DirectX 12 test eleven thousand
ninety five overall score twelve
thousand six hundred and eleven on the
graphics and six thousand 601 on the CPU
ashes of the singularity is next at 4k
and DirectX 12 mode 70 point seven
Everage frames per second which are
three a new test in my benchmarks also
running at 4k 60.1 average frames per
second that's with everything running at
ultra of course moving on the Metro last
site at 4k 90.5 average frames per
second gta5 at 4k 100.8 average frames
per second then I also threw GTA 5 and
running an ultra-wide mode at 34 40 by
1440 got up to 124 average frames per
second so a great option for those of
you rockin a Predator X 34 X 35 and
finally through overwatch in there it's
not too difficult to the title to run as
you can see at 4k I hit 233 point for
average frames per second so in
conclusion this is a crazy powerful
system to a 1080 seems to be a great
option for anyone who's really looking
for that actual 60 plus frames per
second 4k experience also for anyone
who's looking to do 21 by nine-thirty
440 by 1440 especially at a higher frame
rate like one hundred hundred and twenty
eight hundred and forty-four Hertz this
also seems to be a good option for that
definitely overkill if you're just going
to be gaming if you're not going to be
doing anything like content creation or
video editing or just some more heavy
lifting then don't go for this system go
for something more like the 1200 build
that $1200 build that I did last month
of course the trade-off is that with all
the hardware wedged in here you can have
higher temperatures and you can have a
little bit more fan noise because the
fans are going to have to run higher
speeds to get all of that warm air out
of there perhaps maybe this is kind of
the point where you start transitioning
over to where like I feel like a custom
water cooling loop would be a good
solution for something like this because
then you can have the power and the
the reduced noise and better air flow
and all that kind of stuff of course
you're probably going to be spending
another thousand to fifteen hundred
dollars to outfit this system with a
water cooling loop if not more than that
one last thing I wanted to point out is
that if you check out my 1070 SLI video
which I'll link via a card up there the
numbers I got today we're not that much
better than 1070 SLI of course that's a
completely other argument to 2-way cards
versus a better faster single at card
and SLI isn't always going to scale and
all that good stuff but we'll save that
for another video anyway guys if you
enjoyed this one definitely hit the
thumbs up button down there and check
out the description for links to all the
parts for links to voting where you can
vote on what builds I'm going to be
building next month and also links to my
store where you can buy shirts and mugs
and PEG glasses and all that good stuff
thank you guys so much for watching as
always and we'll see you in the next
