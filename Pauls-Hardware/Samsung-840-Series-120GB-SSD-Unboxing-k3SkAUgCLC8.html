today I'm going to be doing a quick
unboxing of this Samsung 840 series 120
gigabyte SSD let's take a closer look at
the box here first off some info this is
a 120 gig SSD made by Samsung a few
things about it it uses TLC memory
that's triple-layer cell or three bits
per cell NAND flash memory runs on a
seder revision3 6 gigabits per second
best so make sure you plug it into one
of those higher-end serial ata
connectors just look at the different
sides of the box and let's take a look
at the back here as well so you can get
some info on the specs SATA 6 gigabits
per second compatible 3 gigabits per
second so you can run it on an older
SATA Rev 2 connector but bear in mind
you will be limiting the speed you have
a three core mdx controller special made
by samsung toggle DDR 2.0 NAND flash
memory it also has a SDRAM cache of low
power ddr2 cache it sports AES 256-bit
encryption so if you're gonna be using
it using this for office or something
that really needs some serious data
protection there you have it
magician software data my gosh data
migration software and the three-year
limited warranty
comes in 120 250 and 500 gig capacities
reads and writes up to 530 and 130
megabytes per second respectively for
this particular drive the hundred 20 gig
of course if you go 240 gig or 500 gig
you can get higher performance but uh
since this is going in a home use system
that should be plenty and I will go
ahead and open it up that's assuming of
course that I could find haha
all right so that's all it comes in the
box here you have your Samsung SSD
manual and software on a disk so that's
going to include those software
utilities that it mentioned on the
outside of the box warranty statements
three-year warranty from Samsung
beautiful it looks stickers case bed
stickers in case you like to put those
on the outside of your case people can
know that you got a samsung SSD inside
we have the driver and installation
guide so if you're not familiar oh yeah
see cuz this is pretty popular for use
in a laptop it's just gonna kind of walk
you through installing in a laptop very
minor using a little USB adapter right
there which isn't included but you can
use that for the data migration software
and it's handy to have one of those
around anyway
and finally the SSD itself in a plastic
tray so I like the look of these Samsung
drives they started this look
prior to this at the eight thirty series
very clean finish
samsung's SSD on the front kind of a
black and orange color scheme going on
there eight forty hundred twenty gig all
the drive info connectors right here
SATA revision three there's your data
connector there's your power connector
nice and thin seven millimeter thickness
and that's especially for use in for
instance a laptop because laptops even
though they can support the 2.5 inch
form factor these drives don't always
have enough vertical clearance so
especially if you're going with a laptop
it's a great choice mounting holes on
the sides as well as the bottom you can
use either of those and that pretty much
does it so thanks for watching my
unboxing once again this has been the
Samsung 840 series SSD I'm looking at
the 120 gig version if you'd like to see
