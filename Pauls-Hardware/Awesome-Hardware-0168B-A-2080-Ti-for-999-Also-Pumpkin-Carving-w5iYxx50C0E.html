efficient but it's it's a holiday
special show so you know new you know
alright so we should be just about live
now so hi everyone
Hey hello and welcome this is awesome
hardware and I am still opening some
links which is why I'm not paying
completely full attention
but awesome hardware yes awesome
partners a live show we stream every
Tuesday evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware we
usually go for about two hours first
half of the show weirdest dreams -
Kyle's channel bit wit we're on episode
hundred and sixty-eight sucide a is
linked in the description if you didn't
watch it
maybe check it out we talked about
things we drank some beer it was it was
good times
you're watching site B now of episode
168 and we will be doing an after-party
at the end where we go over donation
comments and shout out Johnson's to
people about stuff quickly we'll also be
doing pin my PC so and who submitted
earlier we'll be reading off some of
your guys's entries during that exactly
a quick announcement and we forgot to
mention this on Kyle's half of the show
but we're not gonna be doing a show next
week is next week November 6 no show no
show sorry about that
we have no reasons or excuses or
anything just we're not gonna do show
we're confident that you'll survive
everyone will be ok but keep that in
mind we're probably tweeting reminder
that - in the meantime though if you
guys do enjoy our content the shows we
do and all that good stuff and if you
want us to shout Johnson that's you
during the after-party just then check
out our stores and buy some stuff Paul
Cybernet is my store sure it's mugs
social glasses hoodies
it's all super super nice and good and
if you buy it too will able profit us
greatly but yeah it's a great way to
help support our stuff and get yourself
some merch at the same time Kyle's store
is bit wit tech slash store he also has
merchandise it is also very nice yeah
eyes got a sale on a hoodie
buy a hoodie or a shirt to cover your
chesticles yep buy and buy a glass or so
or a mug today we have mugs to help your
mouth whole proceeds like we said go to
us if you buy an awesome hardware
from either of our stores its split
between us so don't worry about which
store you buy from just just by just by
that's all that matters bye-bye now on
to my actual show and I need to start
out by saying I'm very very not prepared
normally I do a pretty good job of
preparing for shows but today was not
didn't proceed as smoothly perhaps as I
expected so why not oh well I will tell
you Cal that's what I'm gonna do right
now is explain to you why I'm not
exactly ready see I have a streaming
system over here you do which I built a
while ago it's got a 69 50 X in it it's
a nice system it's been pretty solid but
it's also been in use for quite some
time
I decided earlier this week that I
wanted to do some 4k capture on it I
forgot that the 4k capture card that I
currently rely on in the system is
functional for capturing from my camera
and that's actually what you guys are
watching right now we're capturing on my
black magic 4k 4k mini capture
Blackmagic mini recorder 4k something
like that with the cards called yeah so
that's functional but what I wanted to
use it for was to capture like a game
you're like a competitive computer
plugged into it and trying to get that
to work I updated the software updating
the software for black magic for some
reason caused the the razor saw software
to glitch out or maybe not the way it
raised your software but at least
capturing with my razor which this this
one ranking razor grip saw so this is a
USB 3 capture device it's external and
this has been working for you no problem
until you updated the Blackmagic drivers
yeah yeah and then all of a sudden this
wasn't working and then suddenly the
capture signal on for this like I'd get
a weird glitch out on like the bottom
third of the screen and then eventually
it would it would usually freeze up with
whatever software I was attempting to
use to do the capturing now I was
suspicious that this device itself might
be failing I've used it pretty
extensively I've tossed it in bags to
take on trips and
thing but I plugged into my laptop and
it worked just fine I recorded parts of
stuff I need it for a video yesterday
doing that probably because it doesn't
have a shitty Blackmagic driver
installed on yeah this is everything's
falling apart over there it's fine and
this took you a span of many many hours
to sort of troubleshoot all this stuff
and go through all these different steps
I spent some time on it yesterday and
then today I was just trying to get and
clear all the Blackmagic software out
there out of there and reload the razor
software and update that and it's just
it was still doing it so I was I was
trying to get a different computer setup
last minute to stream which is fraught
with with issues because it's over there
the noise no the power that you were
building oh what's that noise oh it's my
laptop it's under load yeah so setting
up another computer to do the stream
which would have been interesting
because there's lots of shortcuts and
things that are set up on this system
that aren't otherwise but anyway point
being as sad as it was that the
Blackmagic software update seemed to
have been the initial cause of the
capture function not working I reinstall
the black magic software and I got the
fork a recorder card working so at least
have one of my two Blackmagic capture
cards functional so that you guys can
watch this video that you're watching
right now and then and then also for
some reason my Christian keyboard just
stuff objects Corsair K you think it's a
k95 it's the one with the because the
maximal one got a 10 key on there and
everything yeah and I was like I was
here yeah I'm trying to to make the
thumbnail for the show and literally
like change the thumbnail text from 166
to 168 and like they just pressing 8 and
8 doesn't work like way super bizarre
because his escape with other buttons of
the keyboard were fellows were
but none of the letter keys or the arrow
keys were working at all so there wasn't
Photoshop because he plugged into this
cooler master keyboard it was flawless
so something weird that yeah so that was
odd thank you um but I swapped out the
keyboard
SX that's the one benefit I do have is I
have I have backup hardware for most
stuff so so point being the three news
stories that we're about to go over I
did read so I can talk about with some
level of um of knowledge I just didn't
have notes on them this articles from
Digital Trends and it's been reported a
few places but I believe this is the
original source or at least the original
published article on it and this is
about the Nvidia Archie X xx ATI
graphics cards
I believe specifically the founders
edition graphics cards potentially dying
in alarming numbers now dying in
alarming numbers as the words of Digital
Trends is using please take this with a
grain of salt because we're talking
about information that is being derived
from reddit's as well as in Vidya forums
some period where people are talking
about their RT X xx atti cards that they
have had for not that long I mean they
haven't even been out that long yeah go
and crash a month or so black screen
blue screen of death issues artifacts
cards a fill to work entirely this is
the actual and video for us is just with
the TI founders edition cards isn't
right yeah I mean that's what people are
reporting here so in termina pixelation
kind of like that after this surfaced
because i'm planning to put 228 e TI
founders editions in hotline 2.0 oh yeah
and now I'm like well do I really want
to do that I like the waterless the
first water block already arrived I
don't know why they didn't set it all
together but okay okay no I have to yeah
take one I don't know if I want to now
maybe I'll switch him out for you know
some aftermarket well and so so I want
to clarify this is this is one of those
stories that pops up it's been reported
picked up and are pre reported by a few
different locations
I specifically can't
affecteds nvidia today just to ask if
they wanted to comment on this brand
Dell Rizzo who's our PR rep who is also
quoted in the article specifically in
reference to our mas because I guess
some people were complaining about
Nvidia trying to tell them that they had
to pay for return shipping for their
faulty graphics cards brian says all our
mas are sent a prepaid shipping labels
that's a global process and has been the
case for as long as I can remember so if
you do have an issue you know there's
that Nvidia is gonna replace your card
or whatever you think that can happen do
you think they would do it for reviewers
like me yeah if you had a card Phil I'm
sure they would replace it it wasn't
like a retail Santa specially if it was
a known issue that the RMA rate or the
failure rate was higher than what's to
be expected and that's really the
question that comes down to when it
comes to an article like this we do not
know what percentage of cards are
failing you're talking about a very
expensive graphics card that cost $100
or more and people who buy it are
probably a little bit more and people
who buy it are probably a little bit
more tech savvy probably also use the
internet with some level of proficiency
and are probably a little bit more
likely this is my assumption to go on
and post something or you know on a
public forum rather than just applying
for an Ironman returning it also the
fact is that expensive card so people
are gonna be more likely to complain
when you spend that much on something
you expect it to work so we have no
further information about this being
widespread or even even a higher failure
rate than would be expected with the
normal graphics card launch it's enough
the Digital Trends picked up on some of
the posts on the Nvidia forums and on
reddit in order to put this article
together who knows if it's going to be
something that continues to the point
where NVIDIA has to make any public
statement my response from Nvidia today
was that they are assisting people who
are having issues in a standard fashion
to replace their graphics cards if
they're not functioning properly and
pretty much nothing beyond that which to
me says that at this point they haven't
seen enough returns or enough complaints
about them
do anything outside of what's normal
right so hopefully that's kind of a look
at both sides of the issue obviously if
any of you guys have a 2080 eye
something that I would keep an eye out
for any potential failures because other
people's definitely have experienced
that and batch yeah I mean I'm gonna
just be a bad batch that you know it
happens maybe it's not nothing it has
nothing to do with the actual card
itself maybe just some of the wafers
that got screwed up and you know some
people got those wafers hey I mean if
you do something that that is that has
happened before where like dyes all cut
from the same wafer all have the same
defect right
potentially I mean that's completely
that not that would be speculation
applied to all twenty atti yeah on our
part but you know we'll keep an eye on
that and hopefully it's not terribly
widespread cuz yeah twenty atti
if you got the money for it is a very
nice card
speaking of if you got the money for a
twenty atti you might need a little bit
less money now thanks to EVGA because
they have launched a $1,000 twenty
eighty I know yes well yes the fabled
unicorn twenty atti that's many of us
when they originally launched into
twenty atti founders Edition twelve
hundred dollars in fuel double price one
thousand and all of us were like sure a
thousand yeah sure that's gonna happen
but now and like it might come true yeah
and at lunch like the cheapest one you
could find was eleven fifty I think but
so but this is a black edition from EVGA
they already have a black edition 27 27
t as well as a 28 which are also
supposed to sell for the base level
price so you don't get any RG RGB
fanciness or anything like that on this
card but you know a lot of people don't
care about that what you do get is an
aftermarket design cooler from EVGA
which looks like the same cooler as
their like their XC yeah I wouldn't try
I would expect this to be terribly
different
who knows internally maybe there's one
fewer heat pipes or someone is that for
instance
maybe not factory overclocked or yeah
probably not factories the clock if it's
if it's anything like the 2080 and 2070
and videos actually issuing specifically
stamped dyes for the entry-level price
points that they're not able to sell for
more than $1,000 or overclocked beyond
the base frequencies right but this is
already an auto notify yeah I guess I
guess that's that's the main point here
is that for everyone who was like I want
to buy one it's already out I don't
notify Wow and yeah so so I don't know I
like as I'm so torn about this
I appreciate the fact that they came out
with this card and said this card is a
is a $1,000 card that is the MSRP and
that's what they're selling it for but
like how many of the how many of these
are they is it really just really
popular are lots of people buying these
and they have bunch of them and they all
just sold through them or did they have
like 20 of them yeah and and and like in
a month off 20 more like it can't be
making a ton of profit off of that price
yeah like margins are way slimmer on
GPUs then I initially thought when I was
hearing some of these numbers from like
like straight from from guys like EVGA
like what you only make that much per
card
and so like $8.99 they might be taking a
loss but maybe they can sell more units
for that price I mean they're probably
gonna sell out easily I don't think they
would be taking a loss I don't think cuz
Nvidia knows that their board partners
like they can't be board partners if
they're not able to sell a product at a
profit yeah okay I guess I guess that's
that's a poor game but but they're gonna
be making significantly less yeah and
the people who are selling their cards
for 1,250 because even the twelve
hundred and fifty dollar cards are
selling out for twenty eight yeah and if
they have more of an of a vested
interest or just an interest in selling
the cards that are more expensive then
yeah but that's why the whole two
different GPUs like the - a GPUs versus
the not -
shei GPUs for the 2080 and 2070 you
might potentially look at as a good
thing depending on how well or like how
crappy of an overclocker the base level
ones are if they're doing that
specifically to allocate a certain
amount of product a certain amount of
GPUs that have to be sold sold that
entry-level price and they're doing that
as a response to people complaining in
the past that you never can buy the
cards at the price that they said you
could drive them for for that
entry-level price I think that
ultimately would be a good thing yeah I
mean it's probably the same like GP it's
the a SKU that's that can't be
overclocked right yeah actually no the
Mayans no no - the - a was the
higher-end okay so maybe the non-ac it
so they're probably using an on a skew
chip probably the same ones that are fan
on like the like the the the close
shroud turbo cards stuff like that but
there's it seems like they're slapping
on a much higher and cooler so that
you're gonna get lower noise better
thermals which I mean I feel like a 20
80 TI is still just running stock is
still blazing fast so for you know I
can't imagine that it's worth 200 extra
dollars just to have it factory
overclocked and and maybe overclock it
be able to push the ceiling a little bit
higher on an - a chip yeah and again
it's gonna depend on on the the
manufacturer clock skew skew chips
versus than the base level ones you know
why are the base level ones really just
horrible overclockers can you really
only overclock a base level one to the
overclock speed that the nicer one ship
at and the nicer ones haven't rested yet
like I not not really I tested one card
because that's all I have with the 70s
all right I that'd be interesting I
haven't I haven't gone out and
spearheaded like a group effort to do
more than that yeah but I'm sure more
people are gonna test more cards as time
goes on so right hopefully that
information
become more clear over time all right
one more little story here in my new
segment and that's about the pixel 3xl
which has an interesting bug here Cal
you have you have a pixel 3xl right I
have a pixel to pixel teutonic so you
have a notch is there not yours
there's no notch in the pickle dodge
nope pixel 3xl a notch software has this
funny glitch which is giving another
notch it's it's adding a second notch
this is a joke no it's not a joke this
is an actual glitch that's happening to
multiple people that's part of the
screen right that pixel threes that's
not like this is this is your average
consumer you know this this happened to
him so this is the saw is a software
issue and I believe it's got something
to do with the gyroscopes in there and
rotating the phone because when you
rotate the phone sideways it's got to
determine where the notch is to put the
notch in the display so the knotch lines
up with where the display is actually
blacked out whereas here you know it's
trying to put the notch up here as if
this was the top of the phone so this is
something that that is is is going to be
up then you know fixed with a software
update so they're gonna fix it and
everything but just just given given all
the notch issues that have happens
double notch double funny that you know
you get to add one more in there and
pixel 3xl I I'm still totally happy it's
my pixel Excel right yeah my 0.02 years
old now and I'm just I'm just keeping an
eye out looking for some phone to be
like yeah that's worth dropping five
hundred to a thousand dollars on and
upgrading yeah I had any family I have
absolutely nothing yeah that makes me
want to upgrade method like the only
thing I've seen functionally it's like
this selfie mode like the area I like
the portrait mode the selfie selfie
portrait mode which honestly I think is
a largely a software thing or something
or maybe that's something to do with the
camera what about that feature that
something that was introduced with the
pixel 200k and I feel like the the
iPhone has and now it's like used my
selfie my portrait mode selfie with the
pixel versus the iPhone and what's
what's the difference there that it's
just like quality or that it's like a
white it's it's like I think it's I
think it's mainly a software thing but
it's it's a portrait mode that's
supposed to provide a sharp image of the
face but it also knows that you're
taking a picture of a face so like it
finds the edge of edges of it and does
like a diffusion or a like a bokeh
effect on the background I see and just
better way better artistic and if that's
if that's literally the only thing that
these other phones can do that my phone
currently cannot you can live with that
I don't even care about but yeah that's
the only thing that's popped up where
I'm like yeah that's yeah they need they
need something else as a grabber for me
and you still have a headphone jack
don't you and I have a headphone jack
which I use frequently
I ran into that issue that the problem
this weekend we went up to Big Bear and
I couldn't I brought my Amazon Alexa
thinking that it could be used as a
regular Bluetooth speaker which it could
not FYI what because we didn't have
Wi-Fi in the cabin that we were at and I
was like I have this Amazon let's
echo I should say couldn't use it and I
was like wait cow my brother-in-law's
name is also Cal we call him Kyle 2.0
like grab the auxilary cable from your
car okay he like goes all the way down
and comes back with it I grabbed the
cable I'm like alright we're who's gonna
play this into dongle and forgot
that I did not have a headphone jack on
the phone because the first phone I've
ever had that didn't have a headphone
jack it was really the first time I ever
tried to plug something in to my phone
with a headphone jack that's a shame
it was it was a very sobering moment
that felt dog ashamed at least you don't
have a notch though I do not have a
notch it's true Silver Lining
okay I'm going to start the sponsor spot
yeah can I request that you go grab
here's a zoo very well I was like an
arrogant I already know the dead the
rogue dead guy sure the dead guy you all
right
sponsor spot hey guys today's episode of
awesome hardware is brought to you by
Toshiba hey I have some of their
products every game
that's right Toshiba if you guys check
out the video's description you can find
some links to some Toshiba products
these are all storage drives subha
they're all based on BICS flash memory
which Toshiba is able to manufacture
this fast memory but it's also not crazy
expensive so you can get these for a
very reasonable price so sure folks
looking at like the price 2 gigabyte
ratio for something like a 2.5 inch
drive low czt are 200 very very solid
solid state drive and I recommend it for
any very small in Seoul and China the
RFC 100 is a super teeny tiny nvme SSD
over 1000 I think it's like twelve
hundred megabytes per second reads and
like a thousand or eleven hundred
megabytes per second writes on this guy
and it's super training that's pcie 3.0
by to correct this is nvme this is an
MDOT to drive is it two lanes or four uh
that's a good question I believe it's a
by 2
I think it's two gen 3 by 2 so yes
that's actually kind of cool if you're
looking to utilize your pc aliens
elsewhere it doesn't take up all four if
you're having them got to slot that you
can specifically tell only gives us two
lanes yes yes which it depends on the
slot and the motherboard but yes it's
only isn't two of your PCIe it should be
that way we've also got the XS 700 here
which is an external drive still 2.5
inch form factor but USB 3 it's got type
C port on it it is USB 3.1 gen2
compatible every is it Type C on both
ends its type a on the it has type C on
the right on the drive it's a sign that
comes with two cables

wines brewing deadpan Pilsner dead pan
jazz skulls on it let's keep our theme
alright so we have a pumpkin to carve oh
yes and we have a pumpkin pie ooh
to eat how do we do this what's the UM
its procedure here I think we should
probably work on the pumpkin first sure
it seems more time-intensive and then
maybe you can start on that maybe we can
get that started and then we can switch
to the after-party where yeah all this
debauchery will be more acceptable okay
so let's see are we just gonna carve the
pumpkin you don't have costumes I'm
sorry what leeway are we just gonna
carve a right here on the table yeah
yeah when you lay down any sort of
protective no Hillary why why would we
bother all right all right we're just
gonna
all right maybe we should do that you
cut this table it's a scrap condition
that's hero newspaper would be good
preferably one with interesting articles
on it so we can read and learn things so
I'll be carved yes yes even though you
can just go ham massacre this pumpkin
yeah yeah give me a pumpkin okay cool I
got a bowl bowl for the and I got some
knives if you injure yourself or
anything like that
oh geez hardware sorry goaded liability
company traditional does anyone in chat
have a suggestion for like a design or
anything like that I'll start carving
out the head back away yes actually
she's anyway really yeah it's that sharp
enough for you like I just feel like
it's small it's like a small knife do
you want a bigger knife do you have a
big knife like a big ass fu night good
like a Michael Myers nice
you got a bread knife I feel like you
got to attack this thing if like you
know like a serial killer knife or
something this is big ass the big-ass
pumpkin dude
well danger is my middle name
that I gave myself five seconds ago
screw you
oh yeah oh yeah there we go let's let's
go with this guy see this is more like
it so I can work with this as long as I
go kill myself this is the guy is coming
from the guy who couldn't even walk away
from a bottle unscathed
I've got a giant kitchen knife it's good
thing we're streaming all these
activities that we do
I said I couldn't I couldn't walk away
from a bottle unscathed and I've got a
giant kitchen knife on the stream I'm a
little nervous to use this cuz this I
feel like people this is pumpkin
serrated knife okay the officer rated
this honestly this one's probably the
best this is you think this is a steak
knife okay it is writ you've done so
little like I know that I only have like
the judges what's the cut count three
inches you know what the good things
take time in oh I I loosened it for you
well is this a very tough pumpkin it
really is I feel like it's thick it's
super thick like the see Wow yeah all
right I feel like it's at least like an
inch thick which is worried about here
oh oh yeah you want to freak out oh no I
didn't cut myself I pinched my skin
between the the handle of the knife and
the pumpkin
when I went down really quickly this is
not good let's just let's just drink a
bunch of beer and then use a bunch of
big sharp knives to carve a really hard
pumpkin but we'll make sure to
livestream it so the world can see just
how steel
we are thinking jump pumpkin Kirby
oh no that's this is very everyone this
is a this is a bread knife
oh wait what's my life saying what if he
sauce is is yes appear to rise to the
doctor
remember to cut away from your buddy
here killing me like these sauce is
dying because she's like she's super
good at this kind of things my wife
might be home oh really
that looks like a good shirt this is a
sharp knife uh-huh this is such a good
idea
pie yeah we could just see huh should we
do this bean
I mean we've spent about given that we
haven't even gotten the cut top of the
picked it off you're right
it's been about 10 minutes already and
we have maybe maybe 6 inches 6 or 7
inches of cut thugs are worried too
yes sir just chaos because we put down
newspapers just as hard to cut just
somehow hardest the hardest thing all
right I'm gonna put this
control under control is do you use this
to cut the pie - you can alright this is
much easier to cut them the pumpkin
sorry about the volume I turned it down
because the dogs are working okay
walking up a storm chat don't tend to
volume down later ah do you want to cut
it in like eights or
yeah that sounds reasonable okay
it's or sixteenth sir thirty seconds 123
Mike sighs boys always portions mmm
looking forward to that all right yeah
yeah of things I'm looking forward to
the after party the after-party is a
long revered tradition here at awesome
hardware we've been doing it for like a
month now and that's where we get to do
things where we don't we don't have to
keep things as structured or as
professional as on the normal show
because we receive microfiche my great
family that said given the time and the
fact that I have gone through everything
