back to Pauls hardware if you have been
following my channel then you might have
noticed that I've had a bit of a hard
time getting any videos posted in the
past couple weeks so my apologies for
that I have been crazy busy lately this
last weekend I went on a backpacking
trip I was really exciting but it
involved a lot of preparation to make
sure that we didn't die or anything like
that but what's also coming up is
computex I'm actually leaving in just a
few days for that so I've really not
gotten as far as I would have liked on
my how to build my computer video it is
coming along but it's not ready yet and
I don't want I don't want to rush it and
I just know that for the next couple
weeks I'm not really going to have any
time to do much of anything I'm going to
be gone and I want so I thought of AG
idea which is to distract everyone from
the lack of videos on my channel by
doing a giveaway so that's what this
video is but I should probably have
something to give away so let me take a
look at what I've got available we'll
see what's we'll see what's lying around
here you know funny thing is most of
these boxes back here actually empty
excellent it is decided so what I have
here are a couple of the coolers that I
used in my video where I tested a bunch
of coolers against each other so what
I'm going to do is give the winner of
this giveaway the option to choose
whichever of these they would like to
have both of them perform very well
there within a few points of each other
so not a whole lot of difference
performance wise but the iceberg 240l
prestige from coolermaster is a bit
thicker but it's 2 240 and the h110 here
from corsair is a little bit thinner but
it's a 280 so whatever one will best
suit your needs if you are the winner
then that's which one I will send to you
post a comment on this video letting me
know what you think I'm doing in Taiwan
that'll be kind of fun also I'll put the
dates of when this is going to start and
when it's going to end which I haven't
written done yet but I'm sure I'll have
that all done by the time I post this
video this is going to be an
international giveaway so yeah leave me
a comment hopefully you learn one of
these awesome things I'll be back from
computex in a couple weeks so i'll be
posting some more content i'm going to
try to do a bit of vlogging while i'm
there as well so hopefully i'll be
bringing you something in the interim as
well aside from this big distraction
giveaway so everyone don't pay attention
to the fact that paul hasn't posted any
videos and enter to win one of these
awesome fantastic prizes both of these
have been lightly used but tested and
verified that they work very well thank
you guys so much for your continued
support of my channel and do it all for
you and your your support and your your
feedback and all the comments I've
gotten have been just amazing so thank
you thank you all so much for watching
and I have more stuff planned coming for
the summer so stay tuned don't forget to

see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
