first look at this new LG Ultra Gear
ultra wide gaming monitor LG's ultra
gear series is monitors that are made
for gaming and this monitor features a
trifecta of things that in my opinion
make PC gaming special and different and
separate from say console gaming those
things include refresh rate which for
this monitor goes all the way up to 144
Hertz as well as introducing adaptive
sync in the form of free sync to support
resolution both in the aspect ratio
being ultra wide 21 by nine as well as a
higher resolution 34 40 by 1440 which is
significantly more pixels than a 1920 by
1080 panel and color depth since this is
an IPS nano cell display with HDR
support this is the LG 3 4 GK 950 F
let's get it out of the box
cooler masters sk series mechanical
keyboards help you keep a low profile
with ultra flat double Schottky caps and
a slim minimalist design available in
full size trim as the sk 650 or the even
more portable 10 keyless sk 630 these
keyboards feel great thanks to genuine
Cherry MX low profile mechanical
switches they've also got a durable
brushed aluminum top plate and a
detachable and braided USB type-c cable
so click the sponsor link in the
description for more on the coolermaster
sk 630 and sk 650
so they have some pretty simple
instructions here right as you open the
box and one thing I actually kind of
like here is they do a little foam
insert that is curved so you can set the
monitor down on that since it's a curved
monitor that will allow you to set
things up when it comes to mounting the
stand without worrying about the front
of the monitor itself so I thought that
was a nice little touch this is the back
of the monitor though and I really
quickly wanted to show you the
connections and everything before I
actually mount the stand the stand by
the way attaches to this mount right
here which is a standard 100 millimeter
vaso mount and then for connectivity
back here we have a 2 port USB 3.0 hub a
DisplayPort in dual HDMI inputs a
headphone jack for pass-through if
you're getting audio from the
DisplayPort or HDMI then of course an AC
power plug then on the bottom you have
the single love you can push in or you
can go up down left and right with and
that is your sole means of control for
the on-screen displays which I'll show
you in just a moment I do really like
LG's vaison mount here it's got a little
latch so that's actually to detach it
and then you just got to pop it in an
angle like that snaps into place now
that's on and if I wanted to remove it
just hold that down you can lift it back
off super easy
meanwhile the rest of the base just
attaches with a little slot screw which
you can just attach my hand in fact
that's what they recommend doing no need
to over tighten this
accessories are included here this does
have a fairly sizable external power
brick which is unfortunate I do like the
power brick to be integrated into the
monitors so it's possible but you know
what can you do it does help to keep the
monitors chassis itself a little bit
slimmer when you don't have to include
that they have included a USB 3.0 type B
cable so you can connect up that USB hub
this is a little bracket to help with
cable management at the back and we have
a display port cable an HDMI cable as
well as power cable to plug into the AC
adapter we have this mysterious
accessory which is listed in the manual
but I have no idea what it's actually
for it looks like a cable retention clip
or something like that and finally we
have of course that manual some warranty
information and I like to see that LG is
showing as much disdain for like actual
printed CDs as we typically do these
days it's not even in a sleeve that's
find though you can probably download
all this stuff from the LG website just
getting stuff plugged in back here gonna
use HDMI for now and wanted to show you
the old clip here for cable management
it looks like it fits on just like this
oh yes okay head upside down it that
snaps in much more firmly when it's
vertical like this so there's your cable
management you just pass those down so
you won't see much from the front and
it's it's probably not important but
this little piece has just been baffling
me as far as where it goes the only
place I can figure out that where it
might fit is there is a Kensington lock
on the bottom here so you can lock this
down if it's in a insecure environment
and I was able to kind of pop it in
there said oh no now you could write
your headphone cable through that or
something maybe your your mouse but
there it is time to power on for the
first time that button at the bottom
gives a little beep when it starts
letting you know it's there it's
friendly so we've actually got something
on-screen now which is nice but I'm
going to ignore that briefly to talk
about the stand so here's our stand as
you can see it's got some red accents on
it there are little bright but you know
that's fine red and black that works for
me the stand has height tilts and swivel
but not pivot which is fine so we don't
have too much swivel like that just a
little bit back and forth on the stand
Heights can go about that low or up to
about that high and then tilts we get a
little bit of vertical and a little bit
of negative tilt that way as well so not
a huge range of
but it is a larger monitor so those can
be a little bit more cumbersome it is
sturdy though so it's not giving too
much wobble as it moves around maybe
maybe just slightly we're setting up to
do some game testing but before that a
quick run-through of the on screen
displays again accessible just via this
little nub at the bottom you press it
once and it pops up a display in the
middle of the screen you can press it
again to exits or you can press up to go
to power off which I just did I didn't
mean to do that that's okay it powers
back on pretty quickly oh look you can
even do left and right for volume press
the hold menu up and down for brightness
that's good to know so if we go to the
left we can do input select that gives
you a very simple on-screen display HDMI
one HDMI 2 or DisplayPort that is pretty
straightforward if we go down since this
is a gaming monitor we can access some
gaming presets so these will list the
different things that they're affecting
such as a refresh rate whether or not
free sync is on or off whether or not
the one millisecond motion blur
reduction is on or off
black stabilizer and response time we
can do some presets for gamer one or
game or two there's also an FPS mode and
RTS mode and then it goes back to gamer
one again so you can change or assign
these depending on your preference but
in order to do that we need to go to
settings which you hit right in order to
do and that pops up over on the right
side of the screen settings menu appears
here on the right side of the screen so
here we can also go in and select game
modes we also have access to vivid
reader HDR effect and srgb over here and
once we've selected which of them we
want to adjust we can adjust it here so
for example I want to turn extended
freesync on absolutely black stabilizer
is an option that's gonna mess with the
contrast ratio a bit response time we
want as fast as possible oh look we have
a cheating crosshair reticule we can
also apply in the center of the screen
so that's useful you know if you want to
cheat depending on whether the game
you're playing offers you your reticule
or not and we can also reset game
settings here I'm not sure why it's not
letting me do the one millisecond motion
blur reduction beyond that we have some
picture adjustment functions such as
brightness contrast sharpness gamma
color temperature RGB black level and
the FC input select menu and then
finally of course general where you can
choose language turn on or off smart
energy saving mode power LED can be on
and off and that just lights up a little
nub that I'm pushing to control this
right now
we'll light up red if you turn that on
you can tell it to automatically stand
by after a certain period of time and we
also have a buzzer which is just a
little beep that beeps when you turn the
it on or off you can disable that -
finally OSD lock so you can move this
display around the screen if you want to
so Joe and I we're both able to get some
test time in some playtime with Apex
legends and the Acer predator X 34 just
so we have fresh in our minds a point of
comparison the last thing I also wanted
to point out when it comes to comparison
there is response time for milliseconds
on the Acer predator x 34 down to 1
millisecond on this lg monitor
immediately upon swapping them out
getting this one over and just plugging
it in with all the same settings I think
we have a more vivid and brighter
display I think this is actually my
first experience with a nano cell
technology display which adds extra
cells which is supposed to increase the
color depth and everything but upon
first look it does seem pretty nice
alright so just making sure everything
set up the same way as the predator X 34
was we're still at 34 40 by 1440 and I
bumped the refresh rate from 100 Hertz
up to 144 Hertz so that should be good
SLI mode is turned on in case you're
wondering we're using two gtx ten ATT is
in this system for our tests and then
i'm just going up to the settings mode
here and into our game settings to make
sure that free sync is turned on because
that's one of the big things with this
display now that Nvidia has enabled free
sync monitors to use G sync we should
hopefully be able to take advantage of
that so just switched free sync to
extended mode response time is set to
faster and I'm not using the motion blur
because turning that on turns off free
sync that is a motion blur reduction
which it uses the back light in order to
do that so we're just gonna work without
that for now everything else is as is
I'm using Nvidia driver version 4-1 9.35
but you should be able to do this with
version 417 or later once I turned the
adaptive sync on or the free sync on in
the monitors display it enabled this set
up G sync function right here and do you
think it's enabled look it did
automatically cool alright guys we've
now done a bit of play testing with the
LG g3 4gk 950 F here and I think it was
an absolutely fantastic experience now
if you're comparing this to a very
similar monitor and the Acer predator x3
for when it comes to the gameplay itself
you may or may not distinguish the
difference between a 100 Hertz refresh
rate and a 144 Hertz refresh rate I do I
think but it's only because I've played
through them multiple times it's kind of
like jumping from sixty to a hundred and
then one hundred two hundred and forty
four it's not quite as noticeable but it
is definitely still there also the
response time on this monitor seems
really nice as we're looking through
very action heavy shots there doesn't
seem to be a whole lot of ghosting going
on or images that stay on screen for
more than they should so that's really
nice especially for gaming and then I
asked Joe to give some feedback on his
sort of A to B comparison while he was
playing the game itself he did he said
he didn't notice that much difference
between the two monitors when it comes
to the actual smoothness and fluidity
but when I was playing he said he
noticed a lot more detail coming out
just when it comes to sharpness and
crispness and then I think lastly that
color range just the really bright
vibrant colors of this monitor look very
nice especially when compared to an LG
x34 which granted I've been using for
over three years so colors tend to fade
a little bit over time anyway but I
think for anyone who's looking for sort
of that next generation gaming
experience and you really need the
monitor to pair with the gaming PC in
order to do that you're gonna have a
really nice time with this monitor
because you don't need a crazy high-end
system to push 3440 by 1440 it is fewer
pixels than 4k the fact that you can
turn G sync on is just absolutely
amazing now I'm so glad and Vidya
finally did that because it sucked that
they kept it blocked off for so long but
now this means that anyone who's
purchased like you know a gtx 1070
system based system you got a couple
years ago can easily get this monitor
plug it in and use that variable refresh
rate which is another of the really
really nice features of PC gaming if I
have any complaints about this monitor I
think they're actually all external for
the most part and this also might be
because I'm comparing it to the Acer
predator X 34 which has a very nice
housing and sort of a finished look and
everything this monitor just doesn't
feel quite as premium when it comes to
the housing outside its plastic and
everything it gets the job done but it
just doesn't feel quite as premium as
x34 I also really like the handle the
carrying handle on the back of the x34
stand that's very convenient that this
monitor doesn't have so might be a
little bit more cumbersome to move
around finally it would be nice if it
didn't have this pretty substantial
power brick to plug in but I will say
that while it's in use it doesn't get
terribly hot so at least
two plus one last thing to point out and
this is more of an FYI than anything
else this monitor does not have built-in
speakers I'm not listing that as a
negative because built-in monitor
speakers are almost always awful but if
you actually wanted to get sounds out of
the monitor you would have to plug in
headphones so just something to keep in
mind so I think that's gonna wrap it for
this video guys this monitor retails for
$1,000 what I want to know is how much
your monitor costs right now the one
that you are using what did you pay for
it leave me that info in the comment
section down below because for $1000 I
think this represents a really high
points of PC gaming right now as far as
the features that you can access and the
games that you can play but at $1000 I
want to know how cost prohibitive that's
gonna be prices for PC components have
been going up I'm not sure if a thousand
bucks is reasonable right now or if
that's something that's still out of the
price range of most people let me know
that in the comment section down below
leave a thumbs up on this button if you
enjoyed the video we're gonna play some
more apex legends I think thanks for
watching guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
