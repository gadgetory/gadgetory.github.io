are like three days away from Christmas
so that seems like a great time to
engage on a complete bathroom renovation
right the thermal take view 71 snow
Edition shows off your building style
with a frosty white paint job and four
tempered glass side panels you also get
two pre-installed hundred and forty
millimeter ringed white LED fans a
vertical GPU mount with bracket and
3-way radiator support for water cooling
so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more so that's
right guys this video is a bathroom
remodel we're doing I'm gonna say like a
2/3 remodel on this bathroom not a
complete remodel a quick disclaimer
before we get started though I am by no
means an expert at this so you know take
everything I say with a grain of salt
we're planning this as we go and I'm
figuring stuff out based on other
YouTube videos which by the way I will
link down in the video's description we
have two days to complete this project
we're gonna start by pulling stuff out
and doing a paint job today and then
tomorrow we're gonna be replacing the
vanity hopefully also the mirror up
there swapping out a new toilet and
lastly a quick fix for our shower door
we're just gonna remove it and replace
it with a curtain because this current
one is very difficult to clean we're
gonna leave the tile up in here and
we're also not doing anything about the
floor for now because we might be
replacing our floors in the future
current floors aren't much to look at
but fortunately the vanity we're
installing is a floating one so if we
need to get at that in the future we can
replace the floors without having to
move that although we will have to pull
the toilet again probably but here is
what we're replacing them with for the
sink top we have the rat of ikan which
I'm not gonna try to oh okay here you go
there you go
happy ok he's happy now we've got the
dull scar faucet there for hot and colds
just a single post for that and then
finally we've got the God DeMorgan
actual vanity with two drawers in it God
Morgan of course IKEA is reference to
the very popular movie Bruce Almighty
starring Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman
who plays God so I'm going to attempt to
document this as best I can with a
time-lapse and I'll interjects what I
think it's necessary when things are
going right or going wrong the first
steps are going to be to move this
existing vanity so I can get a better
look at the plumbing behind there
and then we're also going to pull the
toilet out and then we're gonna go
shopping so we can get some paint and we
still need to get two replacement mirror
so I've cleared stuff out and in case
you're wondering the main reasons why we
wanted to do this little projects one
this mirror is large and bulky and it's
also quite high my life is a little bit
shorter so I wanna get something that we
can lower down a little bit and then
this vanity is really just I mean it's
wood and it's kind of ornate but it's
really just a lot more than we want it
gets really dusty down in the bottom and
it's very hard to clean underneath and
it's got this copper ball in it which my
wife just hates it's very very difficult
to keep clean she like scoured this with
a brillo pad like last week and it's
already like very messy so getting rid
of that this is also not level so that
that would be nice to have this level
and that's kind of the inspiration and
then the toilets just old and I'm not
even to show you guys that again the
floor we are planning to replace in the
future but not quite ambitious enough to
do that now but I think we're at the
point where we can pull this away from
the wall check out what's going on
behind it so I got the p-trap pulled out
and I'm sparing you guys the more
horrific parts of this job but I've also
disconnected these two which are the
feets for the hot and cold water and I'm
gonna have to replace this it's still
dripping very slowly this won't actually
just recently replaced that's what kind
of gave me the courage to do this job
was that I replaced that one without too
much difficulty the other day and didn't
have to call plumber for it this one I
noted didn't have the PTFE wrap on it so
for installation job there from the
get-go
but it's leaking too so I'm gonna have
to turn off the main water and replace
that in the meantime though this drain
is what I'm my main concern is as you
can see they did a very thorough
painting job when this was initially
installed also don't look down there
don't look down there it's horrible so I
wasn't gonna show this because it's
somewhat horrible but I wanted to show
some of the ways this old vanity failed
for instance this vertical piece here is
supposed to be sealed on the other side
like with some silicone they never did
that so every time that water was
pulling up again because it wasn't level
it was leaking through back here and
dripping down and causing all this rust
and decay furthermore you can see the
kind of half-assed paint job you were to
think they would have painted here
before they installed all this but they
obviously tried to paint back behind
certain areas as indicated by the paint
on the back of the vanity itself the
baseboard likewise was only painted up
to
and then back here we have a really
gross area where there was obviously in
the past some cockroaches going on now
we don't typically have cockroach issues
here in our home thankfully this is old
but it's still gross so I'm not going to
show you how to clean that up but they
didn't even continue the baseboard all
the way along here they just used some
small pieces to kind of finish it out
there in the corner so I'm gonna need to
replace that entire baseboard although
fortunately I think there isn't much in
the way of water damage down there at
the bottom that appears to be just wet
because of these connections I have just
disconnected unfortunately I had a cap
to put on that one right there so that
it wouldn't keep dripping it's a very
very slow drip now so at this point I'm
just trying to get us field trip ready
this is all the assembly for the
drainage underneath the sink
and this is specifically the piece that
needs to go right here so the right side
of this needs to join up with this drain
piece right here this is PVC and I was
actually kind of scared that this was
going to be copper and there's different
ways to join the copper to the PVC here
but since it is PVC I'm gonna cut this
off because I need to shorten this
anyway then I can use a standard PVC
adapter to get down to this width and
just glue it up as I cut it out
well you made it to Home Depot item
number one was found this is actually
really hard to find cuz they were out of
them but I discovered it and we found a
toilet we wanted to get a single piece
toilet not one of these split piece ones
and there's honestly only one right here
so that's what we're going with the
Glacier Bay and many different options
for white well this is more cream I
guess I raffia cream they both look good
not as yellow as cream we're getting
there almost ready to head back and
start working and added a handcart we
got our paints got some sponges more
painting stuff things looking good I
have no idea how much this is all gonna
cost
so we had a lovely in and out lunch and
diana has actually been in here wiping
the walls down which was nice fun to
make sure those are free of dust and
detritus so that the paint will adhere
to it meanwhile I got to figure out the
plumbing situation back there and if I
didn't already mention it I capped this
guy off because it was leaking I was
gonna get a replacement for this one
this is the lower one that I already
replaced and then I discovered that's
our new IKEA faucet does not have the
same size connectors as our old faucet
now my kid has very good directions for
international because they ship
worldwide depending on your location so
if we're here in North America our
connectors should be 9/16 that's a go
home IKEA you're drunk because that is
absolutely not 9/16 right there this is
actually 3/8 so I guess we got the
European version but that is fine
because instead of getting one
replacements quarter-turn shutoff valve
I got two of them with the proper
connection up on top so I got about
these down there then we can move on
with clearing all this stuff out of here
so we can paint yes I already shut the
water off in case you were wondering
got both of them off
I've made some progress as you can see
we have removed the vanity we have
removed the toilets we have cleaned up
most of the stuff down there although we
still need to do maybe a little bit
sanding in the rough spots so everything
is pretty clear in here we are
definitely thinking like while we
probably should replace this tile
because it's not the best tile in a
bathroom and big surprise this is taking
longer than expected so it's dark now
but we should hopefully be able to get
at least one paint coat of paint on
still this evening welcome to day two so
here's where we left off last night I
got to bed at about 1 a.m. and we did
get our initial first coat of paint on
we have been expecting to do two coats
with this paints of areas you can see
that don't have full coverage should get
better coverage and I did try to remove
all the panels and everything to paint
behind stuff so we have no more splotchy
areas the only thing I didn't remove was
the events here for the air conditioner
and heating and that was so I could
leave the time lapse attached to that so
I did that for you guys after the next
coat of paint though I need to redress
one of my ball valves down here which is
very very very slowly leaking if they
can need to take that off and reattach
it so here is my plumbing problem and
it's one that I'm hoping doesn't force
me to call plumber this is about as far
as I am comfortable going with the
plumbing because I don't know how to do
welding and stuff like that but I have
an existing fitting on here and then
there's a sleeve that goes on it right
there and then that connects to your
ball valve and I think it's a great
compression in there to make it
watertight now my problem is these are
pretty much fused on here I think these
are original and the cap that means the
cap here I can't get off unfortunately
with this top one it worked and I just
used the existing cap and put it on and
everything's fine they're nice and
watertight with this lower one when I
try to compress it there's a leak out
the back so what I'm gonna try to do is
push this cap back I'm gonna
hack use my hack side and just chop this
off right behind that ring I may need to
say in the pipe down a little bit and
then I got a replace a hair replacement
set right here
with the rake the cap and the sleeve
so that's about how much I cut off and
that turned out pretty clean I think so
Thanks cutting tool hey RTX it just
works I don't want to celebrate too soon
or anything here but for the time being
the water back on
it looks like it's not leaking anymore
that is very nice okay time to paint
coat number two
just finish the second coat of paint and
I get to peel this stuff
it is now day three of this two-day
project so yes that means it's Christmas
Eve now Merry Christmas everyone
unfortunately we don't have too much
going on for Christmas here we have some
family coming over tomorrow so we're
trying to get things wrapped up to a
point where the bathroom is usable again
let me take you through what we finished
off last night we removed the old glass
shower door that was really kind of
janky the way it was mounted here they
had actually used wooden shims along
with side which is really not the best
I'm talking about a damp environment so
there was some Christmas going on there
so we've just replaced it with a simple
shower curtain just to keep things easy
for now that's all in there we're doing
a rough set up for the vanity and trying
to figure out where my studs are my
studs are like here here and here and
the vanities a little bit wider than
that so what I'm gonna be doing is
moving these mounts a little bit out
then I'm gonna put an extra piece of
wood back in here to reinforce it then
I'm gonna mount that wood straight back
to the studs and that should get things
nice and stable and sturdy before any of
that that we're gonna put our trim in
but we're just gonna put it in
temporarily because one of the things we
haven't done in this project is replace
the floor we've decided we do want to do
that relatively soon so in the interest
of keeping things simple for that
project in another month or two we're
going to just sort of lay in the trim
around the edges I'll try to cut it to
size and then beyond that we're not
gonna paint it or anything so that would
make it easier get the toilet in get
this mounted and then hopefully we'll be
done with this project for the time
being we're still not 100% set on our
mirror or the cupboard we're gonna put
over here yet so that stuff still
remains to be seen but functionally we
need a toilet and a sink and a shower
and hopefully we can get that all set
today
these are just roughed in for now but
given that I have never done molding
before in my life I'd say this turned
out okay
sad news friends we have run into a
major problem it was my fault I'll that
didn't see it coming I was nailing in
the baseboard down there at the bottom
with some finishing screws in perfectly
innocuous and safe locations somehow I
found one of the copper supply lines I
believe and I punched a hole right
through it
there's the offending nail there was
immediate water pressure release and
spray behind the wall that I could hear
so I went and shut off my water again
and now we are breaking down and having
our plumber come by hopefully it doesn't
cost too much extra on Christmas Eve but
he can at least help me out with like
the very very very very slow leak still
happening with this and maybe mounting
the toilet to that be convenient while
we wait for the plumber some Mexican
food and on the way back from lunch we
get some drywall tape we got some grout
and we got a quarter sheet of drywall
Tonio worked in while we wait for the
plumber and mounting this vanity is
still gonna be a challenge I'm going to
mount an extra piece of wood to the back
so I can mount the wood to the wall and
then bolts the vanity to the wood but
the wood piece I have is a little too
thick so it was actually sticking out
here at the back so rather than get a
thinner piece of wood because I do want
some thickness this is just a piece of
pine I decided to use my router and just
sort of mill out the ends here so I'm
trying to get the depth right on this
and then I can go ahead and do the other
side there as well
and now here we are this this is the end
of the video where I reveal that I have
failed and everything everything went
wrong
technically not everything but I did
have major point of failure when I put a
finishing nail through the baseboard
right into a copper pipe and immediately
had a bunch of water spring behind the
drywall and I knew that I had caused a
major major problem so it's pre up the
comments yes I am an idiot and I should
have known better I know that you're not
supposed to just nail or screw things
into wall without checking what's behind
there but I've never actually had a
major fail like this before so I'm gonna
be much more careful in the future and
for the time being right now there is a
space cut out on the wall right there so
let me show you where we're at so as you
can see we've got a drain right there
and then we've got two copper pipes and
these are these supply lines and that
pipe there is the one that I punched
through and that is the temporary patch
that the plumber put on there because I
managed to do it at such a low point
here in the wall that it's really
challenging to get enough copper pipe to
work with to actually patch it properly
so he did a temporary fix on Christmas
Eve and then he's gonna come back on
Friday so if you can cut further up the
wall and try to bend that pipe out a
little bit to get a little bit more play
a little bit more room to work with and
then hopefully he can patch that
properly and professionally and won't
have to jackhammer into the concrete but
we will see how that goes if you're
wondering this is about a $500 mistake
that I made yeah in the means I know
since we didn't hit our deadline of
getting this project done before
Christmas we now have more time since
it's after Christmas and the deadline
isn't as much of a big deal anymore so
now that we have more time available I'm
thinking like maybe I should tear up the
floor since obviously the floor is not
the best in here and it would be good to
do that before we get the toilet mounted
and stuff so I now may be adding to this
project so hopefully the part 2 video
where I come back and show you guys
everything finished and clean and done
will be interesting as well thank you
guys so much for watching this video
though and by the way I have more home
renovation projects planned in the
future for 2019 so let me know in the
comments below if you want to see more
like this and then lastly there have
been several and YouTube channels that
have been insanely helpful for me in
this
so I'm gonna take links to the videos
that I thought were most helpful and put
those in the description too so check
them out down there if you're interested
in people who know more about what
they're doing than me doing projects
like this thanks again guys hit the
thumbs up button on your way out we'll
