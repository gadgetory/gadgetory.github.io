to today's video every one based on all
of your excellent feedback I am doing
another edition of the first five this
time covering the first five things I
consider when I'm buying a new
motherboard as always your feedback is
appreciated via your comments likes or
dislikes and just like last time I want
to know if you agree or disagree with my
first five choices the motherboard is a
delicate creature though like this
gigabyte z97 X SOC for example often
overlooked often seen is simply a
go-between between or CPU memory storage
and video card and even worse very often
blamed for computer problems that arise
simply due to its central location but
I've had a long and sordid love affair
with motherboards and with the help of
this video you can too since you're all
viewers of my channel I am once again
going to make the astute assumption that
prior to considering your motherboard
you've already chosen a CPU maybe even a
few other choice components for your
build as well but where to go from there
especially when confronted with the
milieu of matriarchal mainboards on any
given PC retail website well the first
thing I would want to do is narrow down
my choices to match the motherboard
socket type with the socket type of my
chosen CPU this one is pretty
straightforward for AMD there is am3+
for CPUs and FM 2 plus for AP use on the
intel side you have LGA 1150 for
mainstream processors as well as LGA
2011 - 3 for high-end enthusiast chips
take this one step further by checking
the motherboard manufacturers website
where CPU compatibility charts will be
available to confirm that your CPU will
work with your chosen motherboard just
remember sometimes a BIOS or UEFI update
might be necessary the second thing is
another compatibility check this time
the motherboards size or form factor
this will make sure it will actually fit
in your case ATX is the standard size
where you'll find the most widest
selection of motherboards and compatible
cases larger sizes like EA TX are a bit
less common they're usually used for
high
and boards they'll need a larger case to
fit them smaller sizes are becoming more
and more popular micro ATX is one step
down from ATX gives you a smaller size
while still retaining some expansion
slots and many I TX is the smallest of
the mainstream form factors suitable for
tiny systems we're minimizing space is
more important than expandability the
third thing I'd look at is the chipset
that's a chip on the board that among
other things helps shuttle data to and
from your CPU from other parts of the
system like your storage SSDs or your
hard drives the chipset can have a big
impact on the board's feature support so
for example on the Intel side you need
an X or Z Series chipset like the X 99
or Z 97 in order to enable overclocking
on your K series CPU like a 49 70 K for
example there are cut-down chipsets that
can be found on budget motherboards but
for my money I always like to go for the
best chipset available that currently
means Z 97 or x99 chipset for Intel
boards or a 88 X or 990 FX chipsets on
the AMD side the fourth thing I consider
is expansion potential building your
computer is all about upgrading at every
chance you get in the future right this
means looking at storage support are
there a bare minimum of SATA connectors
or has the manufacturer added more are
they all say to revision 3 to handle
fast SSDs have they included
next-generation storage like m2 support
or SATA Express also there's the PCI
Express slots you'll need at least one
for your graphics card but are there
more for capture audio or raid cards or
can you add another GPU in the future
with crossfire or SLI support are the
lower pci express slots routed directly
to the cpu or through the chipset which
can limit their performance also I might
like to add memory as a future upgrade
so the DIMM slots are also very
important I consider for to be the
minimum for mainstream systems like Z 97
and I'd like to have eight available for
enthusiast or workstation boards on
Intel's X 99 platform the fifth thing
that I consider much as I hate to admit
it is the board's aesthetics look here
at this gigabyte z97 X SOC board how
beautifully orange-and-black it is say I
was raised by a maximum PC and Gordon
owned to focus on performance with PCs
but as DIY computer building has evolved
I can't help but emphasize
is making a system that is uniquely your
own and aesthetic choices simply play a
huge role in that I chose this board for
example not just because gigabyte is a
manufacturer that I trust and it has all
the features I need but also very much
because I am setting up a build in the
be quiet silent base 800 case which is
black with orange trim and this board
just matches perfectly I make no
apologies for this but honestly if you
go back 10 years or so there was nowhere
near this level of visual choice when it
comes to motherboards with black PCBs
and stylish accents and badass angular
heat designs but that is all of my five
things but there are other things that
you might consider to well motherboard
shopping so I want to know what your
first five things are what features are
designed choices make or break a
