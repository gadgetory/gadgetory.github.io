because it is time for part two of my
2019 how to build a computer video
series and I'm going all out for this
one if you missed part one I talked
about sort of theory about building a
computer what all the parts are and what
they do and how to best choose parts
that will meet your budget and your
needs for building a computer now today
I actually have two systems but even
kind of three systems I'm going to be
putting together to show you the
differences between an intel build and
an AMD build a mini ITX build and a
full-size ATX build as well as three
different price points about a $500
entry-level build about a $900 upgrade
to that build and then a high-end $1,500
system over here on my right today's
video is brought to you by Squarespace
go to squarespace.com slash paul's
hardware for 10% off your first order or
hang around to the end of the video to
find out more so the parts for these
builds were all picked out and my
monthly build series which I do
typically at the beginning of every
month so the February builds actually
did three and again we're looking at an
Andy entry-level build you can get for
about 480 bucks or you can swap out for
the 2600 and a graphics card I've chosen
the GeForce r-tx 2060 right here that
brings the price up to about $900 you
can go with the less expensive graphics
card to shave some money off of that but
of course all that's covered in the
first video where I talk about picking
your parts and saving money here or
spending more money there on my right
side we have all the parts for an
intel-based system
and with the 8700 k for this build
because you get six cores with
hyper-threading so 12 threads total it's
a really good processor for gaming and
it's a little bit more expensive but you
get more performance along with it so
this system over here is gonna cost you
about fifteen hundred dollars let me
quickly go over the parts for both
systems so starting with our sub $500
build and I want to point out that the
cases that I'm using today were both
picked up by Joe he just went to a micro
Center and picked him out so cuz I
wanted some organic like normal cases so
masterbox light five is what reason for
this you can usually get this for about
sixty to sixty-five dollars Joe got the
RGB one because that's what they had
there but you can save five bucks by
going with the non RGB version for a 500
dollar budget I'd recommend spending
about a hundred dollars on the case and
the power supply so about sixty bucks
for the case and then you're gonna look
for a 550 watt 80 plus bronze rated
power supply for about forty dollars
which I have linked in the video's
description
I'm using a stand-in for today so
apologies for that this is a v6 50 from
coolermaster which actually isn't really
available anymore but
like the 550 watt Corsair unit I have
linked in the description this is at
least modular this one's fully modular
but that one's partially modular and
it's got all black cables another
stand-in for today is our SSD I'm just
recommending a 500 gig class SSD which
you should be able to find for about 50
or 55 dollars again I have a good one
link to the description for today's
build I'm using the SanDisk SSD SanDisk
makes solid SSDs so if you can find one
of theirs go for it for both systems I
have a 16 gig memory kit that's 2 8 gig
sticks and I'm going for ddr4 3000 or
3200 speed go for a faster memory if you
can find it but don't spend too much
more 3,000 3200 is where you get the
most bang for your buck this trip draws
5 kit is ddr4 3200 and specifically
plays nicely with Rison that's why I
picked it out so definitely make sure if
you're choosing Rison memory that it is
compatible and will work with Rison at
its rated speed 115 dollars you can get
this kit for right now the kid I'm using
for the Intel build is a little bit
fancier but it's roughly the same when
it comes to specs still 16 gigs still
3200 speed but this kit costs 15 bucks
more right now it's 130 dollars and
that's because it's got fancy RGB
lighting which is completely optional
completely ascetic and completely up to
you whether you want to go for it or not
but I've got both of them so I can show
you guys both options for our CPU we
have the AMD risin 320 200 G this is a
CPU with graphics integrated so it's got
all that in the chip so you don't need a
graphics card with this build this will
be perfectly adequate for 1080 gaming it
will have some limitations when it comes
to graphics capabilities but for less
than $100 a quad core CPU and graphics
gets you up and running and this entire
system can be upgraded to a $900 system
which I'll show you in just a second
before that though our motherboard is
the MSI B 450 tomahawk about 110 hundred
and fifteen dollars for this board B 450
chips that still allows overclocking and
it's got solid power delivery so if you
upgrade to a higher-end processor you
could still overclock it even the eight
cores on this platform so if you go with
these six components you can get in for
less than $500 but you can also of
course upgrade so if you swap in the
horizon 520 600 you now have a 6 core 12
thread CPU but no graphics integrated
this is about 165 dollars so that's
going to add about 70 75 dollars to the
price and then of course you're going to
need a graphics card since we no longer
have integrated Vega graphics in this
CPU so I am recommending the r-tx 2060
right now you can get them for about 350
and this is the MSI gaming Z Twin Frozr
seven version of that but by swapping
out just those two components you're
gonna raise the overall price of the
system to around $900 but you're gonna
get insanely more performance both with
the extra cores and threads on the CPU
as well as a huge jump up going from the
apu to a discrete graphics card with the
RT x 2060 and now for our intel buildin
this one was actually designed around a
$1,500 price because every month on my
monthly builds video I asked you guys
for feedback and everyone wanted to see
a $1,500 build so this is what I would
spend fifteen hundred bucks on if I was
going for a higher-end gaming PC with an
Intel processor processor I've chosen is
the i7 8700 K which is a six quarts well
thread processor Intel did some kind of
weird stuff with their current
generation of 9000 series CPUs the 9700
K is an 8 core processor but it does not
have hyper threading so you actually get
more threads with this CPU but it costs
about 30 or 40 bucks less it is also
unlocked for overclocking but all of the
K series CPUs from Intel that are
unlocked for overclocking do not come
with a CPU cooler so we're gonna need
the master liquid ml 240 our RGB for
cooling this is about $100 all in one
liquid cooler and I'm not going to go
into comparing and contrasting different
all-in-one liquid coolers but 100 bucks
is a pretty reasonable price for a 240
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler and
I know this one is a good performer
going back to the Rison system if you're
wondering how these CPUs would be cooled
they actually come with heatsink fans in
the Box known as the Wraith stealth and
the Wraith spire these are not the best
air coolers by any stretch but
considering that they come essentially
free in the Box you can go ahead and use
them and they will work for you just
fine and then maybe in the future you
can consider upgrading now one thing I
want to point out is if you're spending
say 100 or 200 dollars on a CPU don't
spend $100 on an all-in-one liquid
cooler spend like 30 or 40 bucks on
something like an aftermarket
air cooler like the hyper 212 black
you'd be using your money much more
effectively upgrading this Rison 520 600
to say a risin 720 700 or 2700 X versus
going with a fancy almond liquid cooler
but I digress as Jay likes to say let's
move on our motherboard for the Intel
build as the RG Strix III 90 - I gaming
this motherboard is going to cost you
close to $200 it comes with fancier
features but most importantly it's mini
ITX so it's going to fit in our case and
give us a nice tiny more compact build
since we are putting the system in the
NZXT h2
I this is a mini ITX case but it's still
slightly on the larger side so it's
still a vertical tower with a basement
at the bottom for your power supply
still supports a full size power supply
so we're just going to be dropping in an
EVGA 650 G Q here which is a 650 watt 80
plus gold rated power supply with
partially modular cables on the back as
well as all black cabling for memory we
have the aforementioned
team T force Nighthawk RGB kit which is
a little bit fancier and blingy with its
RGB then I have a couple choices here
for an SSD I wanted a single nvme m2
Drive like this one and you can actually
get this type of SSD for around 70 to 80
dollars for a 500 gig class Drive at
this point which is a really good deal
but I was trying to come in under the
$1,500 price so I opted to drop this one
in here just because I was looking at
500 gig SATA SSDs that are 2.5 inch
drives like this one as well as SATA
rather than that m2 interface and I
found you could get a t force Delta RGB
one like this for about 55 or 60 dollars
which is about 20 or 30 bucks savings
over something like this Drive and
lastly for a graphics card I have this
r-tx 20 80 here which you can get for
$700 if you go for an aftermarket
version but that would make this build
cost about $1,700 total actually meant
to use a $500 RTX 2070 but fortunately
for the purposes of this tutorial they
both install in exactly the same way so
those are the parts I'm working with
today I'm primarily gonna be using a
Phillips head screwdriver to assemble
everything but I'll point out to you
guys if I use anything else let's get
started with a tutorial we're gonna
start off with some glorious motherboard
unboxings but my workspace here is open
its non-conductive I'm working on a wood
surface and if you want to be extra safe
then maybe consider something like a
mouse mat or something rubber or
something soft that you can work with
the components on so you don't damage
anything I currently have the
motherboards for both builds and I've
also got the memory and the CPUs and
then from a fancy build here I've also
gotten my MDOT - SSD for accessories
apart from the motherboard there's gonna
be a bunch of other stuff in the Box
like this is a Wi-Fi antenna they can
set most this stuff aside and worry
about it later you might want to grab a
SATA cable if you have a SATA SSD that
you need to plug in so now I've got both
boards out just so I can show you what I
would pull out if I'm doing a build for
the first time the motherboard manual
for each one of course SATA cables if
you need them we actually don't for this
build so I've just got one for our AMD
build over here I did pull out these
very small
screws that we're gonna be using to
mounts are a little MDOT to nvme drive
and then the motherboard IO shields
something you'll definitely want to get
out so you don't forget to install it
that goes over the motherboards inputs
and outputs over on this side like that
but a fancy new thing that some of other
boards are doing and this is I guess one
of the benefits you get for paying more
for a motherboard is that the Asus board
here has a fixed IO shield which
actually is very convenient I like that
this Rison v 2600 is actually brand new
so I'm going to use this to show you
guys kind of a brand new unboxing and
installation experience inside we've got
the CPU itself and we have the Wraith
cooler that it ships with and an
important thing to note with the cooler
the stock heatsink fan it comes with is
that it will have pre applied thermal
paste right there so you don't want to
touch that or mess with it at all until
you're ready to install it and you
certainly don't want to add any more
than what's already there because you've
got plenty this is a wraith stealth so
I'm gonna set that aside now here I also
want to point out that physically the
2200 G and the 2600 look exactly the
same and they have the exact same number
of pins on the bottom when it comes to
installation there's no difference
between the two of these just make sure
you know if you've got the right CPU it
should be labeled on the top there are
some slight differences if you're
looking at an Intel processor versus an
AMD processor the main will be that
there are flat contacts or LGA on the
bottom of the Intel vs. pins that are on
the bottom of the AMD CPU pins are very
delicate you should definitely be
careful not to bend them or break them
and also try not to touch any of the
gold contacts on either the CPUs
thankfully though one thing that's
Universal is the triangle there's a gold
triangle on the corner of both of those
CPUs and you're gonna use that to
determine the orientation to install
into the respective socket on your
motherboard let's do the rise in CPU
first if you look where the gold
triangle is on the corner of the CPU
there's also a triangle edged into one
corner of the CPU socket we're gonna
gently lift up our little retention arm
which will open up the sockets line up
that triangle with the proper triangle
in the socket itself and then the
processor should just drop down into the
socket this is a zip or zero insertion
force socket so you shouldn't have to
press down on it at all if it's not
dropping in then lift it up and try to
reseat it or double check that you don't
have any bent pins on the bottom of your
processor once it's dropped in though
all you got to do is lower that little
arm and you're set for our Intel CPU the
pins are on the socket itself so those
are very delicate and that's why there's
a plastic cover over the top
we're gonna take our attention arm here
again push it out to the side and lift
it up and that will open the suck it up
you could pop this cover off right now
but I do want to point out that the
triangle is actually on the edge of that
cover if you pop it off there's a little
triangle on the edge of the retention
bracket as well but I recommend just
leaving it on reference which corner
that little triangles on take your CP
you line it up at the socket there's a
couple notches on either side of the CPU
as well that will line up with notches
in the socket drop it straight down I
give it just the slightest little jiggle
to make sure it's seated in there and
then we can lower the top make sure it's
under the little nut right there lower
the retention arm and as you push that
down which requires a little bit of
pressure but not too much the plastic
cover should pop off and now your CPU is
installed it's a good idea to get your
motherboard set up as much as possible
before you install it in your case
there's a few things that I can also do
besides the CPU installation here memory
I can install them both of these for my
smaller system here since I have one of
these little MDOT two SSDs I can install
that there as well and then I'm also
going to be thinking about my cooling
solution so I will be installing my
cooler onto this one here since this
smaller system is using an all-in-one
liquid cooler I'll definitely want to
get the backplate installed on that so
let's start out with this little SSD
though this is an MDOT two SSD MDOT 2
refers to the connector here at the end
and it is a 2280
SSD which means it's 22 millimeters wide
and 80 millimeters long is actually some
shorter and longer SSDs that also
conform to this form factor and then
your motherboard may or may not have a
heatsink for your little MDOT to drive
he thinks not necessary it can run
without it but if you've got it you
might as well go ahead and use it on
this motherboard there's two little
screws that hold the heatsink on and
then under the heatsink there's a
thermal pad with a protective piece of
plastic on it we'll get back to that you
want to fish around in your motherboard
accessories and find these two tiny tiny
little screws
what is it nuts and what is an actual
screw the nut we're gonna put on the
longer of the two points here on the
actual MDOT two mounting area I'm just
gonna hand tighten this on there but you
could tighten it down with a socket if
you wanted to or if you had one
available I also want to point out here
that this is a small motherboard and so
that's a little bit more cramped to work
with there but I got that on also I have
another screwdriver it's still Phillips
head but it's a smaller one to handle
these tiny little screws we can now
install the SSD there's a notch here
that'll line up with the notch and the
end up to slot and if you're concerned
about how
this label on here most of the m-dot to
nvme drives that i've worked with the
labels are actually thermally conductive
so you can still leave that on but just
slot the SSD in at an angle lower it
down and then secure it with your tiny
little screw next I'm removing the
protective plastic from the heatsink
putting the heatsink back on top there
and then securing it back down put the
two screws that hold it in place don't
forget that too next up is memory
installations so I'm just gonna take my
two dem slots here open up the one side
here some dim slots have little latches
on both sides some do not have them on
one side that's totally fine both ways
work but the memory there's a notch
that's slightly off-center on the edge
connector there at the bottom so you
just want to make sure that's lined up
with the notch in the dim slot on the
motherboard lower it down and then just
give firm pressure from the top both
sides it gives a really satisfying click
into place and the little latch on the
side will also close up and you'll know
that it is secure also get both of them
installed there and then you can kind of
reality check that they're both the same
level that means they're both installed
properly moving back to the AMD system
we have four dimm slots and two sticks
of memory so which slot should we
install them to the short answer the
easy answer is probably going to be
every other slots and the slots that are
further from the CPU usually to start
with if you want to double-check a
reality check
bust out your motherboard manual to make
sure that those are the right slots
usually they'll say populate these slots
first and then these slots next beyond
that installation is just the same as it
was on our install board line up that
notch in the bottom put the stick into
the slots firm pressure down on top of
it and it will click into place now
let's talk about CPU coolers because
there's a bunch of different mounting
methods for those depending on whether
you're using AMD or Intel and whether
using the stock heatsink fan or not now
AMD's mounting solution for these stock
heatsink fans actually like because AMD
motherboards at least am for socket
motherboards come with this metal back
plates on the back of the motherboard
and then on the top it's got a couple
little plastic notches there are some
coolers that use these notches but for
AMD's race series of coolers all you
have to do is remove this top piece and
again I'm shooting with a new tool still
a Phillips head screwdriver it's just
motorized this time so I've just pulled
those off and I would recommend saving
these just put them in a ziplock and
keep them in your motherboard box
because if you do upgrade your cooler in
the future there's a chance that we'll
need these bear in mind with that
removed your back plate will now
stay put so if you do want to keep that
in mind but all we're gonna do is take
our Wraith stealth cooler by the way
this is a race stealth at the 2600 comes
with we're just gonna line up those four
screws with the four screws on the
Wraith and lower it down when you're
installing any CPU cooler you should
keep this method in mind which is that
you want to get the corners threaded so
there I just got all four corners
threaded but just barely so you don't
want to cinch down one corner before you
have the others going it's the basic
idea and then from there we can go and
just give a couple twists on opposite
corners and we'll slowly tighten the
whole thing down so that we get good
contact between the base of this heat
sink fan and the CPU itself now that
thermal paste squishes in between to
fill in any gaps make sure we have good
thermal conductivity once that's
tightened down it's actually sturdy
enough that you can hold the entire
motherboard up by it so keep that in
mind it might be convenient while you're
installing and then you want to make
sure that you go ahead and plug in your
CPU fan you should have a single
probably a four pin plug for your CPU
fan that comes with and then your
motherboard should have a four pin
header that is labeled CPU fan that's
somewhere close in relation to the CPU
socket and just plug that in there for
our Intel build I'm busting out the
closed-loop cooler that we're gonna use
master liquid ml 240 our RGB because
it's very helpful to get this back plate
set up now our intel board does not come
with a backplate that's standard for the
mainstream intel stuff but our CPU
cooler does for better contacts now CPU
coolers aftermarket ones install in a
whole variety of different ways so I
highly recommend if you get one
reference the manual for it for the
proper installation procedures but the
back plates has some adjustments back
here that you can line up for the
different sockets once you have that it
pushes through like that and then this
one at least has these little plastic
caps I can fit over the top that'll
kinda hold it in place so it won't fall
off as I do the actual installation with
this installed I can kind of leave it
for now move ahead with the rest of the
builds and then when I come back to
actually installing the closer cooler
thing on here it'll be ready to go with
those mounting points if you purchased a
locked Intel CPU or not one of the
unlocked case cues that are capable of
overclocking it will ship with a stock
heatsink fan that will look somewhat
similar to this these do not require a
back
on the back of the motherboard they just
mount from the top they also have
thermal paste to pre-install just like
this and this just uses a plug system so
the arrows on top are actually to unlock
so you want to actually turn those
against the direction they're pointing
and then you can position it over the
top and then push down on opposite
corners on each one of those to get it
installed and now here's how you unbox a
computer case first you'll want to slit
the tape across the top flaps next we
open side flaps and then we flip the
whole thing upside down key point to
separate the noobs from the experience
PC builders these little hand flaps down
here pull them out then lift off the box
warning you're about to get a static
shock I recommend using your elbow and
finally we can remove the styrofoam put
that back in the box as well as the
plastic and get our first look at our
brand-new case maybe not just like same
procedure for the Mini ITX case here are
our two cases and even though this case
is significantly more expensive in this
case it is smaller mini ITX
full-size ATX also commonly called a ATX
mid tower and they have the same layout
which I'm kind of happy with because
it's a pretty standard layout front
intake at the front for both of them
there is a power supply area at the
bottom and then exhaust at the top and
the back I find with most cases if
you've never worked with it before it's
a good idea just to spend a little bit
of time with it take it apart take the
side panels off figure out how things
work and especially if you've got
tempered glass side panel windows like
this or acrylic ones leave this plastic
sheeting on it while you work with it
that way you won't have to worry about
fingerprints or scratches and then you
can peel it off and you've got the build
all finished for most cases side panels
are held on with a couple thumb screws
in the back sometimes they're capped at
thumb screws so they stay with it and
make it easier or harder to lose them
which we always appreciate then in most
cases you get a small box of accessories
and other things to help you work with
the case screws are often in here so
here's a good time to grab a metal tray
like this one or if you don't have that
just a cup or something so that as
you're taking screws up you can put them
all in the location where you won't lose
them and also at this point is a good
time to start sort of reality checking
where things are where they're going to
go where cables need to be routed in
particular and where your fans are
located this case from Coolermaster
actually comes with four fans
which is pretty nice it's got three
intakes in the front was 120 millimeter
and it's got one exhaust here at the
back that's a perfectly good
configuration to go with so we leave
those bands as is and then just kind of
look at where stuff's gonna go the
motherboard sits at the back on the
motherboard tray motherboard trays very
often have this big cutout and that's so
you can get at the back of the
motherboard if you need to install one
of those backplate so I was talking
about earlier while we're back here you
notice a bunch of these little knockouts
these are for cable tie downs so as
you're routing cables back here you can
cinch them down and get them as tidy as
possible power supply mount is down here
at the bottom and that does have a
little basement area so it's kind of
covered so if your power supply doesn't
look very pretty it'll still look okay
and then as far as actually plugging
stuff into the computer once it's all
put together that'll all be back here
for the most part your motherboard IO
panel will go right here once its
installed
and then these expansion slots down here
at the bottom are for stuff like
graphics cards or other cards you can
add on there like audio cards or capture
cards but the way I like to do things is
get that motherboard set up like we've
already done and get the case out and
take a look at it and we're going to
install our power supply on the case
power supply on the case I feel like are
very closely tied together then we can
install the motherboard at that point
I'll show you where everything actually
plugs in on the back of the power supply
is where your power plug is for your AC
power cable that plugs into the wall so
that wants to face back and then power
supplies will pretty much always have a
fan that you usually want to point that
down because most cases down here where
the power supply goes are gonna have an
intake area right there and they might
even have a bit of a dust filter this is
a budget case so it doesn't have a very
good dust filter but it's still better
than nothing and also in this case at
least in other cases too if I pointed it
up it's really blocked right there so
you don't want to obstruct the intake of
this fan right there if it's open inside
the case it's okay to have the fan
pointing up just as a general rule I
tend to face it down oh also as power
supply mounts from the back so this
bracket removes with a couple thumb
screws you actually attach it here with
the regular power supply screws and then
put the whole thing in I also want to
point out I'm going to talk about
plugging in cables in just a second but
I've already pre plugged in the modular
plugs to this power supply that I know
I'm gonna need that will almost always
include the 24 pin cable as well as
supplemental CPU power which is going to
be either a 4 pin or an 8 pin plug if
you're not sure about that though just
jump ahead a little bit and I'll talk
about which plugs you will need
depending on hardware you're installing
fortunately for our intel build the
power supply installation is pretty much
exactly the same we have a fan we want
to point that down we've got this it's
going to point backwards there's a
bracket pre-installed on this case
that's for sfx power supplies which are
smaller but since we have a full sized
one we're just gonna remove that and
install it there and again I've already
got the plugs plugged into the power
supply that I wants which is 24 pin for
the motherboard power eight pin or a 4 +
4 pin for the motherboard supplemental
CPU power I've got some SATA power plugs
here and that is so I can plug in the
SSD this case has a little hug right
here which can control fans as well as
LEDs and it has an extra plug that comes
down here so that's going to need some
SATA power and then finally the graphics
card has PCI Express graphics power
these usually labeled as VGA or PCI
Express graphics this one needs an 8 pin
and a 6 pin so I've got both of those
set aside and you should be very careful
not to confuse these 8 pin supplemental
graphics power connectors which are
going to be a 6 pin block plus a 2 pin
block that's optional with the
supplemental CPU power connector because
that's also a pin that this separates
into two blocks of 4
so at this point I'm ready to install
everything else in the case but the big
questions are going to be what plugs
into what because plugging things in is
what most of the rest of the build is
about and since everything plugs into
the motherboard I thought I'd give a
once-over of all the plugs on the
motherboard and what is required to plug
into them for this project first power
from the power supply that's gonna plug
in at the top right here they have an 8
pin sometimes you'll see a 4 pin here
sometimes you'll even see an 8 + other
supplemental connectors usually all you
need is that main 8 pin connector plug
in unless you're doing crazy high-end
overclocking also the 24 pin connector
which is down here along the edge of the
board
beyond that you might find RGB LED
headers more on those in just a second
system fan headers are very important
they're usually labeled like system fan
3 or pump fan these are often just
suggestions as far as what you plug into
what but they'll usually be labeled in
the system UEFI or BIOS as to what is
what more on that in the third video but
generally any fan you can plug in as
long as it's a 3 or 4 pin standard fan
header
these are SATA ports you'll notice
they're kind of l-shaped and kind of
narrower these will be for plugging in
SSDs hard drives like 3.5 inch
mechanical hard drives you can also plug
in optical drives to these but usually
you'll find four or maybe six on a
motherboard like this there's two more
here and then finally along the bottom
edge of the board you have a bunch of
smaller pin outs these can be a little
annoying to plug in but they're all
necessary to some degree this right here
is a USB 3.0 header so USB 3 will
require that these are USB 2.0 headers
we will not be needing these today since
our case doesn't have USB 2.0 on the
front panel sometimes you can plug other
devices into this though like RGB
control boxes and all-in-one liquid
cooler pumps right here you have front
panel connectors they're labeled jfp one
on this motherboard but this is
something you want to double check your
motherboard manual about they often put
a tiny little chart above it pointing
out to which connectors are which we're
gonna get back to this in just a second
it's a pain in the butt but necessary if
you want your power and reset buttons to
work
finally a comm header you can ignore
another RGB header which more on that in
just a second audio front panel header
is right there so if you want your front
panel mic and headphone jack to work
you'll need to plug in your HDL though
honestly front panel making headphone
jacks are usually not that great quality
but it's there if you have it and here's
the same kind of once-over real quick
with the mini ITX board so 24 pin
power and 8-pin power from the power
supply go there three fan headers here
across the top these are RGB headers on
the right is a three pin one that's a 5
volt addressable header on the left is a
four pin one that is a 12 volt non
addressable header actually think that
RGB LED headers are some of the worst
connectors on a motherboard simply
because you can accidentally plug into
the wrong one just keep in mind they're
not compatible know whether you have
addressable or non addressable RGB LEDs
and don't try to daisy chain these
together or especially don't try to plug
in your 4 pin header into the 3 pin out
which you can do it's harder to plug the
3 pin into the 4 pin they do have SATA
ports on here to our right here and 2 or
over there on the other side of the
memory and then we've got front panel
USB once again so that is the USB 3.0
there on the left this right here is the
newest USB 3.1 gen2 connector so if you
have a fancy new case that has that on
it you probably want to get a fancy
newer motherboard that has that
connector on it as well we won't be
using this one today because the H 200 I
does not have that connector but wanted
to point out that it's there we have a
single full-length PCI Express by 16
slot right there that is where your
graphics card is going to plug in and
then that means everything else on this
board when it comes to front panel
header is USB and HD audio is all right
in there in that little spot so again
there's going to be a real pain to get
to but will suffer through it and now
for motherboard installation we have
four mounting points for a mini ITX
motherboard like this one one on each
corner pretty much and we have standoffs
that are pre-installed in the case
standoffs are absolutely required for
any computer being installed onto a
motherboard tray like this since they're
pre-installed we don't need to worry
about them but definitely double check
that they are there and then we can just
go ahead and drop this in I would
normally install the i/o shield first
but it is pre-installed on this
motherboard so we can just sort of angle
it into place line it up with those
standoffs and you want to go into your
accessory box fish out some screws
double check that the screws will thread
into the standoffs properly I've already
done that and then we can screw the
motherboard in and the rule of thumb
here for these motherboard stand us is
that you want the screws to be snug but
not too tight now our AMD build here is
a little bit more traditional we only
have one or two standoffs pre-installed
so we're going to need to make sure we
figure out where the other ones go
fortunately this motherboard is a very
standard ATX motherboard so there are
nine standoff point locations one
two and three across the top four five
and six here in the middle seven eight
and nine across the bottom we just need
to make sure that all nine of those
points which we'll label on the case
with an A a four standard ATX the M is
for micro ATX and then a couple
suggestions for these standoffs
themselves one is that you'll often get
a little standoff tightening that
definitely use this don't be afraid to
tighten these standoffs down pretty good
into the case don't over tighten and
strip them but you can tighten them
pretty good you don't want them to back
off if you ever have to uninstall your
motherboard the other thing is to make
sure which stand off screws you want to
use so you'll find those in your case
accessory box and just go ahead and
thread those in and make sure that they
actually fit properly before you go
ahead and install those I've got all
nine standoffs installed got to make
sure to install the iOS shields make
sure this is oriented vertically usually
the sound IO is at the bottom going to
install that and this will knock it
right here if you have any difficulty
getting the corners of this to pop in
feel free to use the butt end of a
screwdriver to kind of pop it in place
and do be careful these can sometimes
cut you now for the motherboard
installation pay attention to your rear
i/o cuz that needs to pop through that
i/o shield that was just installed so
you kind of angle that in now the two
standoffs that were pre-installed in
this case actually have a little ridges
that pop out on top of them so once I
get it sitting on those it should kind
of stay in place right there so that
just happened
now it should mostly stay there while I
can get my screws and finish securing it
to the case
now we get to plug everything in I'm
gonna use this rear fan plugging in
right here is sort of an example of a
few things one fan headers a lot of fan
headers are three pin like this one
that's just fine even if you have a four
pin header you can still plug it in just
bear in mind there's a little plastic
notch on one side that needs to line up
with the three prong portion next up
cable management like you don't want to
just leave this hang in there loosely
we'll we'll give you a hard time on our
live show if you send in a picture of
your computer and you do that but don't
kill yourself over it either that is an
extremely basic job I just looped the
cable around and wrapped some twist tie
around it and then sort of wrap that up
to keep it somewhat tidy if I was doing
this and I wanted to be more
presentation worthy I probably would
have looped it around and tried to tuck
it in back here and just have the cable
come out to plug in there but I just
want to point out guys
cable management is important it helps
keep clear airflow through the case and
also help keep helps keeping things from
getting dusty all the time but it also
doesn't need to be an immaculate job
with no cables visible anywhere
especially if it's your first time
building for our AMD build here are the
rest of the cables sticking out the
opposite side of the case so here at the
front there's three fans and they're RGB
fans since this is the RGB version of
this case there's three three pin fan
plugs so I could just plug these in if I
wanted just the fans to spin up and I
didn't want the fans to light up and
then there's a separate plug here for
the RGB LEDs so I can actually go ahead
and plug this directly into the RGB
header on the motherboard it's a four
pin 12 volt by the way and that way the
front fans will light up to be on that
we've got front panel stuff in this
group USB 3.0 these are standard front
panel headers often the most hated part
of a PC builds because they're very
small but those are gonna go into the
front panel header
there's our HD audio and then from the
power supply power SATA PCI Express and
supplemental CPU now there's no set
order for plugging in all these cables
so I'm just gonna start with the front
panel ones cuz I hate those the most so
get it out of the way
I am unplugging this little fan splitter
these are for the three front panel fans
it just connected it over to a molex
plug I would have to plug a molex plug
into my power supply to plug this in and
when you have a molex plug just direct
connection from your power supply to
your fans they just run at full speed I
want to have fan speed control from my
motherboard for these fans so I'm gonna
plug these directly into the motherboard
itself so since I'm passing cables from
this side of the case through to this
side of the case to plug them in it's
good to have like a nice angle on it so
you
come at it from the back and you can
sort of reach both sides a nice kind of
reach around action I I had a small
problem plugging the fans in which is
that these fan cables need to reach up
to these three headers on the
motherboard and this one just just
barely doesn't quite reach it's not the
option of getting like a little splitter
or a small extension but that's not
included with any of the parts so I
didn't want to add that so instead I've
just unmounted this fan I'm gonna rotate
it 90 degrees so that the cables go from
being down at the bottom it's a little
bit higher up and that should give me
enough cable length for these connectors
from the power supply just bear in mind
they all have a clasp on one side and
that should line up with a little Ridge
or catch on the plug itself and
sometimes you need to kind of wobble
these back and forth or work them in but
usually just some firm pressure should
get it to snap in place and you're good
to go supplemental CPU power is up in
the top corner of the motherboard and
there's the smallest little pass-through
gap right there for it so I'm just gonna
feed these through I'm not sure how
visible this is gonna be but just
wrapping these around plugging them in
the same way as I did the 24 pin now the
horrible front panel connectors they're
all plugging into this little block
right here and there's a chart for it
here and this should also be reflected
in the manual bear in mind that the LEDs
are labeled with plus and minus so you
might notice the hard drive LED has plus
and minus there the power LED also has
plus and minus and those you need to
plug in properly in order for them to
work right the power switch and reset
switch you can plug in either way and
it'll work so don't worry about those
Hey and there's front panel you notice I
already plugged in the USB 3 as well
that's just got a notch on one side for
orientation and now our front panels are
connected actually the last thing I
forgot was our RGB header that's feeding
over to the three front fans I wasn't
gonna dwell too much on RGB for this
video but it is something that can add a
lot of complexity to build especially if
you're doing the addressable stuff
fortunately this is simple 12 volt 4 pin
connector there's a little arrow on one
side that should line up with the 12
volts which is the highlighted left pin
here so all you got to do is plug that
in and now our fan should light up
pretty pretty RGB colors we're almost
done with the less expensive version of
this build the SSD I'm gonna mount right
up here because there's a
little SSD mounts there are also some
drive caddies down here in the bottom of
the system where I could mount a 2.5
inch or 3.5 inch drive but since I got
an SSD and black it red it'll match go
ahead and install it up here just four
small Phillips head screws at the bottom
those were also included with the case
accessories and now we can use the
single thumb screw to install this up
here I already showed you an m2 Drive
installation but if you're using one of
these 2.5 inch or 3.5 inch drives this
is a mechanical Drive this is an SSD
they both have two plugs on the back or
the bottom however you look at it both
these plugs on the back have an L shape
to them so they can only be plugged in
one way there's a longer connector on
the left that's for power and there's a
shorter connector on the right that is
for data so the left is going to need a
plug from your power supply and the
right is going to need a SATA cable that
routes from that plug over to your
motherboard
I'm afraid I never showed you guys how I
got this front panel piece off but for
most cases it's a standard method which
is just to grab the bottom underneath
right here and give it a tug and it
should pop off and then it just snaps
back on kind of in the same way but I'm
happy to say the build one of three
would be done right now if we were
building that sub $500 build because if
we had installed the 2200 G here instead
of the 2600 we'd essentially be set to
go our motherboards installed power
supplies connected up to everything we
have our SSD installed for our operating
system we could turn it on we use the
video outs on the motherboard back here
to connect up our monitor and then we
could get the system up and running and
start loading windows or whatever we
wanted to do if we then wanted to get
this system a massive upgrade it would
simply be a matter of uninstalling the
CPU heatsink fan which you guys should
be familiar with now removing the 2200 G
getting your 2600 or 2600 X or 2700 or
2700 X for that matter installing it
reinstalling your cooling solution on it
and then of course adding a graphic
skirt so that's what we're going to do
next
for graphics card we have a long edge
connector right there that is going to
slot into the top PCI Express slot at
the back we have IO that's gonna line up
with the i/o brackets at the back and
then we've got a couple supplemental
power connector plugs that we need to
plug in as well so if you line it up
right here you can get an idea of which
of the two rear brackets you're going to
need to remove to provide space for the
rear video outs then we're going to take
our edge connector line it up with that
PCI Express slot and we will go ahead
and push it back once it goes in all the
way there should be a bracket here back
on the PCIe slot that sort of engages
and holds the card in place then you can
take those screws you just removed and
replace them to hold it even more
securely and finally those PCI Express
graphics power cables that I had set
aside earlier just feeding through from
the back and we're gonna go ahead and
plug in again latches on the bottom
there so one and this is a six pin so
the two pin here just isn't going to be
used and - if your cables are bulging on
your cable management side here's the
pro way of reinstalling your side panel
tada and now we have gone from a 500 ish
dollar kind of entry level gaming still
powerful but good gaming PC for 1080 or
so - like a crazy nice system that you
could game and stream on at the same
time this graphics card could easily
handle 1440 or even some 4k titles
depending on the resolution you're
playing at and everything and you've got
a really nice system so that's what I
really like about this platform from AMD
the upgrade path you can start out with
something simple you can upgrade to
something much nicer so getting back to
the Intel build we essentially have to
do the same stuff that we just did with
the AMD builds the main difference with
this system is that we now have an
all-in-one liquid cooler to deal with
and this fortunately isn't that much
more complex than what we did with the
original build it's mainly a question of
this radiator that we have we need to
position somewhere in the case this pump
and block unit we need to connect up to
the CPU so it's got good contact and
it's cooling stuff and we need to make
sure that everything's plugged in
because I got a couple fans that are
gonna go on the radiator and of course
we have to make sure that everything's
plugged in for the pump side as well
guys I'm gonna mostly ignore the RGB
features of this cooler to focus on the
functional parts of it and practically
speaking installation for right now so
this is going to go in the front of the
case about like so and we're gonna have
a couple fans connected to it they're
gonna be moving air we need to make sure
these are moving air in the right
direction
pretty much all fans the side that
doesn't have a bracket is going to be
where the air goes in and the side that
does have the bracket on the back is
where the air is going to come out but
the point being is that when this is on
the front we want air to be drawn in
through this so we're going to want
those exhausts parts to be pointed back
like that so that's how we're going to
mount them all so we can think about how
we want the cables to go I want them to
be fed towards the back of the case so
I'm going to rotate these around so that
those are in a better location to be fed
towards the back
here's another pointer we can make about
things you spend a little bit more money
on and features that you don't get with
lower end cases is a removable radiator
brackets
that's actually a pretty useful feature
if you install you an all-in-one liquid
cooler with four thumb screws here at
the Front's I can remove this whole
bracket now we can mount the radiator to
the bracket and then mount the bracket
back to the case and feeling like we're
in the homestretch here but again
plugging in cables and we have pretty
much the same array of cables that we
have with a larger case 24 pin we have
some SATA plugs because I don't want to
plug in this little NZXT hub
supplemental CPU PCI Express power we've
got a USB 3 we've got a USB 2 cuz that
also goes over to this little hub they
have front panel which is in a block
thank you thank you NZXT for making
these in a single block so you can just
plug them all in at once and HD audio is
also right there we've also got some fan
headers potentially and then just the
single SATA power also for that little
NZXT hub so might as well plug that in
right now and I decided to do the plug
in before I actually install the CPU
block pump just to give us a little bit
more room to work with inside I'm also
abandoning most of the RGB in this build
I'm just gonna have some basic
functional RGB setup because we have
like three different potential RGB
systems we have NZXT T's we have cooler
masters we've got the asus stuff on the
motherboard there's not a whole lot of
room to work with in this case
especially along that top edge but
fortunately I have all the important
things plugged in where they're supposed
to be plugged in and now I can move back
to the CPU installation I did route the
CPU pump plug up to the pump header up
there to to make sure that's plugged in
before I install this because it'll be a
lot harder to get at once this is
installed there's a separate bracket
that I need to install here to line up
with the Intel socket and then I will
just mount it to the backplate to piece
that I installed towards the beginning
of this video but before I do the final
installation I will need to add some
thermal paste this CPU cooler has been
used before so it needs thermal paste
between the copper contact plates and
the CPU heat spreader itself if you got
an all-in-one liquid cooler chances are
it will come with a small tube of
thermal paste which you can usually get
a few uses out of at least but the basic
idea is to put about a pea-sized or
maybe slightly smaller than a pea
maybe between a grain of rice and a
pea-sized blob of thermal paste right in
the dead center of the CPU I'm not just
gonna twist the CPU pump block around so
I can mount it on the back plate that I
set up before get it to fed over those
threads try to get nice even pressure
down on that thermal paste that I just
installed and then I will take my little
cap screws and start screwing down again
here we're gonna use the four corners
method just get each of the four corners
threaded on there and then tighten them
down a little bit at a time going in a
circuitous sort of fashion last thing to
install is the graphics card and this
has sort of a two-tier external
retention system for this case just
because it's a mini ATX case so it's
smaller so the mounting hardware is here
on the outside but I'm just gonna remove
these first little bracket pops off and
then you can get at the screws behind it
and now our last potential conflicts our
front panel connectors HD audio and
everything are kind of covering the PCIe
slot but definitely something that you
want to plug in first I'm gonna need to
push those over to the side then they're
gonna kind of feed through this little
gap that's right there between the
bracket and the PCIe slot so guys I now
have two computers that I have built
today and hopefully you guys now know
how to build these computers to the fact
that they are both spinning up and
seemingly working is a very good sign
and of course the next step is going to
be installation of Windows and a bunch
of other stuff that's all coming in the
video part 3 where we get to that we now
have the fun part
before I move on though I'd like to

and thank you to Squarespace for
sponsoring this video so I think this is
the first time that I've built two
systems in a single tutorial video and
that caused me to get confused and in
fact you probably already are aware of
this but I've realized that I put the
wrong graphics card in the wrong system
this system was supposed to have an RT X
2060 which I put in here this system was
supposed to have an RT X 2070 and I
instead installed the RT X 2080 in here
so this system was supposed to be about
a $900 build with an RT X 2060 in it and
this system was supposed to be about a
$1500 build with an RT X 2070 and it's
fortunately when it comes to building
the systems that doesn't really matter
the graphics cards are essentially the
same except for the power connectors
that plug in so when it comes to you
building your own system all the
instructions you saw today we're
accurate I'm just probably gonna swap
these before I move on to the third
video especially if I'm going to do any
testing with these systems the other
thing I might recommend that not
everyone does but you can do if you're
worried about getting your whole system
built and then finding a defective
product is doing an outside-of-the-box
build before you put everything together
I didn't do that today but I'll post a
link in the description to one of my
earlier how to build a PC videos where I
did do that it's pretty simple it's just
like assembling the system but without
the case and then you power
to make sure everything works and then
you're like okay good and then you can
go through with the installation all of
my hardware seems to be working properly
so that's good
knock on wood of course and we can move
on to stage three stay tuned for that
video of course and thank you so much
for watching this one hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoy it and I'll post
links to lots of relevant stuff down in
the video description down below don't
forget to subscribe if you're not
already thank you guys so much again and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
