ticks at Memory speed that's kind of the
focus of this video but if you don't
believe me check out the text power up
article that I have referenced right
here this is actually revealed about a
month ago by Robert Halleck over at AMD
and among the different potential
culprits for explaining some of Ryan's
lack of performance in very specific at
CPU limited situations with gaming this
has become one of the prime suspects so
there's other things that might have
affected it and I want to address those
really quickly for instance game support
in general and that was just proven for
instance with the ashes of the
singularity update which provided about
a 30% improvement with a rise in CPU in
certain situations we've also had
potentials for Windows updates that
might cause some improvements as well
but in my opinion when you look at
overall improving the performance of
Verizon across the board it seems like
memory speed is actually one of the
things that's a pretty significant
factor so to that end we have a new kit
of memory here from g.skill this is the
flare X and it's designed very
specifically for AMD Rison platforms
this is a 3200 speed kit kats latency is
14 14 14 14 34 to be specific and it's a
1.3 5 volts kit now before I dive into
actually installing this on my testbed
and doing some testing I did do a bit of
research so I wanted to reference that
and of course links to all the stuff is
down in the description below first off
of course just the revelation that
Infinity fabric does take at memory
speed Infinity fabrics put simply is the
interconnect the communication layer
that's in between the different parts of
a Rison processor specifically it
handles the interchange of information
between the two CCX unix units that
exist in say arise in 17 arise in 1800 X
processor the theory is that latency
between those those CCX units and arisin
processor is what is causing some of the
slowdown specifically again in cpu
limited gaming situations like gaming at
1080 but there has been a lot of testing
and updates and stuff like that in the
interim so I have a couple legit reviews
articles listed here these are posted by
name
then he actually went over what is the
best ddr4 clock speed for a m4 and to
sum up his article 3200 was kind of
where he found the sweet spot was you're
not going to pay as much as you do for a
3200 kit as you would paying for like a
premium kit like a 4000 speed which are
still a lot more rare so you can get a
good amount of price to performance and
you do get according to him something in
the range of a 60% performance boost in
1080p gaming and about a 50% in
performance improvement in memory
bandwidth tests which are more
synthetics but you can see that there is
a pretty significant difference he also
did a more recent article discussing
single rank versus dual rank ddr4 memory
performance and this is another reason
why you might consider getting a kit
like this clerics kit from G CL is that
single rank and and dual rank memory
configurations hasn't been a thing
that's been discussed for quite some
time it just hasn't really had an effect
but with Rison which seems to be a bit
more particular about the memory speeds
and even more specifically the memory
modules that are on each memory stick it
does seem like single rank is the way to
go and that is what you I believe will
be guaranteed to get with the G steal
kit they're not saying specifically but
I feel like if they're if they're doing
what they know how to do as G skill
they're probably giving you Samsung ICS
which are have been shown to be more
stable with Rison and also single rank
kits as far as we can tell again all we
know from the packaging is that this is
ddr4 3200 cache latency of course
supports teen and then they specifically
say it uses high performance integrated
circuits screen specifically for the AMD
platform so I have to assume that means
it's going to be Samsung single rank
stuff and again jumping back to Nathan's
article here he found that especially
when overclocking going a single rank to
dim configuration is going to get you
much higher speeds that are possible as
well as a better performance overall
also bear in mind that again a two kits
configuration is probably going to be a
little bit more stable at this point in
time we're waiting on additional
motherboard BIOS updates more validation
from the memory manufacturers themselves
but right out of the gate that seems to
be a good option
looking for a bit of a boost in
performance with their writing setups as
well as hopefully improved gaming
performance here is another video that
has actually kind of taken off just
recently this is from mind blank tech
has got about 8,000 subscribers on
YouTube right now but a very well-done
video where he actually got a 1700 X up
and running at 3600 speed so eighteen oh
three point nine or so the x 2.is that
would actually equal the memory speed he
is also running at about four gigahertz
and he found through a bunch of tests
and again I'll link this in the
description so you guys can check them
all out I also like his over his
overlays he found some significant
performance improvements depending on
the game that you're playing and even in
some situations like here at mafia 3 the
1700 X actually jumps ahead of the 7700
K of course there's lots of other
specifics when it comes to his testing
configurations that are pointed out in
the video so again I encourage you guys
to check that out if you want to and
then finally I found xB NPC a fairly
small YouTube channel but there's lots
of videos on horizon recently and he
actually has this specific kit of RAM
and he was able to do BC okay overclock
and run it at 3400 I believe was what he
was actually running it trying to get at
or 3466 or so was what he had so he also
goes through very specifically all of
his configurations and the BIOS and
everything like that I don't think I'm
going to be going specifically for the
3467 setup that he had with a base clock
of 118 point 2 if nothing else I'm going
to go for the straight out of the box
3200 speed settings that most people
dial and pretty quickly
and then I'll be testing that against my
existing 29:33 benchmarks or I need to
redo my 29:33 settings benchmarks with
the 1070 and the 1700 X and this is of
course all leading up to further
preparation for my rise in the 5 video
which should be coming out the rise and
fives on top which should be coming out
very very soon like really soon can't
tell you exactly when but rise in 5
launches on April 11th so that's maybe a
little bit of a hint for you guys my
touch stud over here though is basically
the same system that I was using for my
rising
seven overclocking video is Asus
crosshair six hero and I go to use them
the latest bios version that's available
from them
I had a Corsair H 100 IV 2 for the CCU
cooler 1700 Verizon 7 1700 is a CPU
that's in there i have a gtx 1070 from
Galax here i also be running over clocks
the operating system and games are on a
patriot hellfire m2 480 gig SSD which is
an nvm s nvme SSDs it's very fast
everything is powered by course our HX
1000 high power supply and then of
course the memory is going to be my
flare x kit here from g CL 3200 speed
memory I'm going to get this installed
I'm going to kind of go through and do
some testing whatever I'll come back and
tell you guys what I've settled on as
far as my testing goes and then we'll do
some benchmarks and some closing
thoughts so I actually decided pretty
quickly that I was not gonna do the
expanded memory overclock I was going to
settle with 3200 speed vs. 29:33 speeds
so I remember 29:33 is already a bit of
an overclock out of the box for rise in
memory and not everyone has been able to
hit it
so I'm not doing the wider gaps of
comparisons that you would see with like
a 2133 speed ddr4 memory kit versus
something like 3200 but I started by
getting the latest version of the rise
and master utility as well as my other
monitoring utilities like CPU Z and then
I updated the crosshair 6 hero
motherboard to the latest version of the
bios which was released just march 24th
it's version 1002
microcode updates for the rise in CPU in
there as well which is of course the
1700 I did also install the balanced
power plan that's optimized for AMD
Rison processors this was just recently
published on the AMD Rison community
website which has a specific power plan
tailored for rides and CPUs it's not
available in Windows 10 when you first
load it up so you do need to do an extra
step to get this but I'm trying to give
this setup the best possible chance at
getting some good scores so I decided to
go with that as well from there I moved
on into overclocking and this is
actually pretty much the same overclock
I had on my 1700
when I did my overclocking video a few
weeks back but it's a 3.9 gigahertz
turning about 1.3 5 volts and that's via
a plus point zero seven five volt offset
using the Asus UEFI configuration and
then for the baseline test the memory is
running at de r4 2933 with casa latency
of 1616 1639 which is not the tightest
timings but it is what it runs that out
of the box if you just plug in 29 33 and
again it's just for the baseline
now after that I've ran some tests of
course and I'll come back to that in a
minute but then I overclocked the memory
just using the UEFI I was able to just
basically plug in the same cast latency
values and frequency that are listed on
the flower x kit so 3200 speed 14 14 14
34 was the timings fortunately
everything was pretty much rock-solid
after I dialed that in and from there I
was able to do some benchmark tests I
started out with the asus rog real bench
which is sort of a real-world test runs
through multiple tests my baseline test
score 145,000 850 and with the memory
overclocked I got up to 148 thousand 672
next up I did the Ida 64 memory
bandwidth test this is definitely a
synthetic test it's purely testing raw
memory bandwidth bandwidth speed
read/write copy and latency and since
there's some very specific numbers here
I'm just going to show these to you guys
right side by side don't pay too much
attention to the cache because that
won't be affected by my memory overclock
that top line for the memory is what you
want to look at and definitely a nice
improvement in latency as well as the
overall scores next up I did some gaming
benchmarks I started with GTA 5 which is
where I saw some definite disparity
between KB Lake and rise in when I did
my initial test running at 1080 here I
got 122 frames per second average with
the memory at 29 33 Buffy the memory a
memory up to 3200 got me up to 125
frames per second average seems fairly
minor but that is an improvement and it
was repeatable so we're definitely
seeing at least a percentage increase
with the higher memory speed here next I
went for for honor and I really ran the
steps because it's a new one and it's
got a nice can benchmark and so I just
threw it in there before actually
double-checking some other people's
results before honor is one of those
games that's really just not showing
much
between Rison and kb lakes so as a
results improving my memory speed really
got me the same it results overall and
that just goes to show that the 1080
performance deficits that you're seeing
in some situations with horizon it's not
across the board you have to be CPU
limited for honor it's not a game that
CPU limited even at 1080 so the results
were pretty much the same
finally I popped in ashes of the
singularity it had a recent update so I
wanted to test it I'm not testing
against the old version of ashes but I
am testing in DirectX 12 mode at 1080
with the extreme profile and here I got
67.7 average frames per second with the
memory overclock that's compared to 60
3.1 average frames per second that I got
without that memory overclocked so that
was a pretty significant improvement and
definitely the most pronounced of all
the tests that I ran so just to wrap
things up and run down the results and
remember here I'm testing 29:33 versus
3200 not 2133 versus 3280
actual memory speed but in real bet real
bench I saw 2 percent overall score
improvement it's pretty small but
definitely something I guess 64 saw 8.3
percent faster reads 9.1 percent faster
writes 10% faster copy score and 16
percent reduced latency and I think that
reduced latency is a pretty key factor
when it comes to performance
improvements particularly with gaming in
GTA 5 had a 1.6 percent better overall
frame rate so again pretty minor but
definitely measurable and for honor
again there was no change so not really
much to speak of there and then ashes of
the singularity I had a 7.3 percent
better average frame rate and a 7.5
percent better average CPU frame rate so
there again very pronounced improved
scores and I would love to see how this
could do going even beyond that like
pushing it up to like 3400 or 3500 or
something like that unfortunately I'm
running out of time very quickly because
the Rison 5 launch is right around the
corner so I'm going to have to cut these
tests off here and hopefully come back
to this in the future there you go guys
pretty clear evidence in my opinion that
memory speed is a significant factor
when it comes to the overall performance
of your Rison based system that is not
to say this is the end-all be-all of
course
then plenty of tests already at lower
memory speeds that have shown rise in
performing very well it just depends
what you're doing in CPU limited gaming
situations though which is kind of the
point of contention for most people
right now when it comes to Rison
especially if you're talking about Rison
versus intel kb lake or something like
that memory speed matters and it's
definitely very nice to have the
availability of the G scale Flair X kit
so that you know you have a validated
and tested kit that can run at those
higher speeds that will pretty much out
of the box work with your Rison setup
but that's all for this video because I
have a lot more testing still to do
because risin 5 again it's just right
around the corner so guys if you're
interested in my risin 5 testing which I
have lots of plans for definitely hit
