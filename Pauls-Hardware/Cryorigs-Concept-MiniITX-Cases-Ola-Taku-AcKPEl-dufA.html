g.skill I'm not cry Rig guys have you
heard of Prayer rig they make these
things behind us right here look CPU
coolers but believe it or not I'm
actually not going to talk about any of
these actually have cry rigs h7 back at
home it's become very popular tell me
about $35 seems like a very nice say
hyper 212 kind of replacement looks a
little bit cleaner and I'm going to be
testing that out very soon but uh let's
you know let's not even talk about these
because cry rig has some new chassis so
this case is called the Ola just like in
Spanish hello so this one is currently
sporting kind of a wood finish on the
fronts they're making this to fit into a
home theater environment and they were
inspired a little bit by the Mac Pro now
say what you will about the Mac Pro and
Mac in general they did some pretty damn
good design work so it would be nice if
you could say build your own custom PC
and something similar to that that's
kind of a cry we had in mind so they've
made this chassis this is kind of the
open version of its so you can see in
the front it's a mini mini ITX
motherboard at the top it has some
ventilation there's 140 millimeter fan
that will exhaust the air at the top
very much in the similar way the Mac Pro
does below that we have space for a 3.5
inch as well as a 2.5 inch drive and
then below that or behind that you have
a standard SFX power supply so will
accept those around on the back there's
your full-size graphics card it's
currently sporting a GTX 1080 so it
should be able to support just about any
GPU up to about 10.5 11 inches which is
very nice they've even taken some
special considerations for say cable
management for instance your IO is going
to be at the top right here they've put
some special little hooks going down the
side so you can wrap those at the bottom
and give yourself a very clean
experience especially we're going to
have this in a home theater environment
they say and this could work as a home
theater I think that would work I think
as a desktop to it looked pretty nice
it's got a fairly small footprint being
cylindrical of course and the nice thing
is it's going to do it in a couple
different finishes at least for starters
it's still sort of in the design phases
this probably is going to be coming out
so maybe q1 or q2 next year 2017 so guys
leave some comments in the comment
section
let them know if you think this is a
cool chassis and maybe if you have an
ideas for them them that way maybe
they'll
at them since it's still under
development there's one more over here
and next it's otaku which made me think
of taco which made me this Mexican food
since I'm in Taiwan Taiwan has delicious
food but Mexican food is not really
their Forte anyway I'm getting off topic
here the taco is meant to be a desktop
computer and it's also means desk in
Japanese taku so it looks like a little
desk it has room to fit a full-size
keyboard underneath and it could even
pop a monitor up on top too which is
pretty convenient power buttons right up
front they're also going to be adding
some IO of course since you are going to
need some IO plenty of ventilation up at
top and you can also sort of push it on
this thing it'll pop out like a little
drawer and whereas this one is wired up
so I can't pull it out too far you can
sort of bring that all the way up so you
can work on your system up here they
have sort of an open one so you can see
how it's laid out inside so again mini
ITX form-factor they've got a riser card
here for a graphics card right now I
believe that's a nano in there but it
looks like you got a decent amount of
length for longer graphics cards as well
over here you have a mount for 3.5 inch
and a 2.5 inch drive again small or SFX
power supply compatibility and again a
very sort of Mac looking look I repeated
myself but I think it's pretty clean
overall and for anyone who's looking for
that really clean desk setup I know how
do you get there into that this seems
like a very viable option so the taku
they're looking to possibly release by
the end of this year
or possibly q1 next year in 2017 but
again let them know what you guys think
but and in the comments below because
they're still looking for feedback on
this one again this has been the Ola and
otaku from cryo rig thanks for watching
this video guys one last shout out to my
sponsors fractal design g.skill and MSI
we'll see you guys in the next video
