the description to learn more what's up
guys welcome back to pulsar where
today's video is like the Empire Strikes
Back of the riptides build Riptide is
the new system I'm putting together just
recently assembled part 1 in the corsair
1000d case which is a very large full
tower case that supports up to 2 systems
a full-size ATX sized system up here as
well as a amount for a smaller mini ITX
system down at the bottom I'm building
this system to be a functional system
that I'm going to use for the
foreseeable future to edit videos as
well as operate as a free nest so
FreeNAS is gonna be the mini ITX build
on the bottom bunch of hard drives then
up here we've got a dual 1080 Ti is
third or four 1950 X this is an all AMD
system 2 by the way and then arisin 520
400 G APU powered system down at the
bottom if you watched part 1 of this
build you'll notice that I got
everything together and functional but
there's a lot missing now let's begin
the middle video on the build I have a
bunch of small tasks that I need to take
care of things I needed to figure out
that I couldn't quite figure out until I
had the system put together and then of
course the big question of all of these
RGB LED fans as well as RGB LEDs how do
you actually connect all these up get
them functional and looking good in a
case like this so I'm gonna focus a
decent amount of time today on the RGB
setup because it is fairly complex I got
these Corsair LLC 120 millimeter as well
some hundred and forty millimeter fans
up at the top there those are controlled
by the Corsair commander Pro and you get
one of these pre-installed in the system
and you can also add more because they
can daisy chain together via USB so can
I go over some of the more specifics of
how you actually connect the fans up to
this to control both the fan speed as
well as the RGB LEDs and then I have
other things here like you might have
noticed I never installed an SLI bridge
that's dead of a minor thing have a heat
sink fan for the APU system
the bottom and install some of the SSDs
gonna install this 10 gigabit NIC that
comes with the Asus enos extreme
motherboard that's at the center of this
entire build 10 gigabit NIC is probably
something I'm gonna need you to add on
to my home network to actually be
capable of supporting but it's good to
have that as well finally there are some
logistical concerns for the FreeNAS
system down at the bottom I need to
figure out how to get my drive set up
for that an operating system SSD and a
cache drive I was considering using the
annex 500 but I think I'm actually going
to go with a riser card and then one of
the MDOT two slots on the board more on
that when we get to it beyond that got
to get measurements done for the cable
sleeving and then I think that will be
all for today but there's also this one
last thing this is an asus rog lootcrate
showed up a few days ago and i'm going
to be using some of these peripherals in
here on the system once it's actually
fully put together now if you want to
see a full unboxing of all the stuff in
here check out Kyle's channel he already
did that but I for my part I'm going to
take this out of loot crate right now so
one of the dilemmas I encountered with
this build since it is co-sponsored by
Asus and Corsair was that both companies
make peripherals so I was like alright
asus or corsair whichever of you can
send me like a loot crate made of wood
and put your peripherals in that and
that's whose peripherals i will use so
here from asus we've got the RG Strix
fusion 500 this is an RGB 7.1 gaming
headsets Wireless I don't use wireless
headsets that often so I will have to
give this a shot try it out
next up the RG Gladius 2 origin this is
a gaming mouse it's got a detachable
cable 12,000 dpi optical sensor and of
course illuminated RGB logo and
everything of course compatible with the
asus or a sync software we've also got
this guy right here of course also from
the ROG line this is the RG RG Strix
flare gaming mechanical RGB keyboard
this one has a pretty cool effect in
that it's got some lighting effects
along the edges that lights a desk
underneath the keyboard give yourself
some of that desk lighting that everyone
is so after so that should be
interesting to give a shot as well
Cherry MX red switches on
since it is of course mechanical then
finally we've got the RG scabbard which
is a mousepad
it's gaming it's a gaming mouse pad so
guys I'm probably gonna take a closer
look at this stuff once I actually get
the system set up back in the computer
room but for now if you guys do want a
little bit better look at these products
check out Kyle's video he did an
unboxing of this loot crate because ASA
set these loot crate's - quite a few of
us youtubers out there and you know see
what he thought of it look this even
includes a rubber texture of the bottom
I feel bad for not getting the nx500 out
of the box in part 1 of this video it is
a very pretty and substantially serious
looking SSD and this does scale and
capacity up to I believe 2 terabytes or
at least one terabyte though this is a
400 gig version for the time being I am
going to pull one of the attend eights
yes and that's basically because these
are effectively three slot 1080 T eyes
due to the cooling solution on top we
have dual spacing so we have four
full-length PCI Express 6 by 16 slots
it's a double space so with these cards
in the top and third full-length slots
they're blocking the second and fourth
full-length slots which means our
expansion cards cannot be installed and
since I want to install the operating
system on this I'm gonna get that in
there now fortunately once we switch
these to water cooling they're going to
be a lot thinner so we will have access
to these slots once again and of course
adding this graphics card back in and
setting up SLI won't be much of a
challenge but getting this drive in to
get the operating system set up is more
important right now
I mentioned this a little bit in the
first video but this power supply shroud
is also the mount for your mini ATX
motherboards so if you need to get at
the power supply you need to pull this
shroud up which isn't that difficult to
get out there's only two thumb screws
that hold it in but if your mini ITX
system is all set up so that might be
slightly more of a challenge so what I'm
gonna do right now is take any cables
that I think I maybe might need in the
future including my USB adapter here for
Corsair link because all my peripheral
cable plugs they're trapped in there and
be really difficult to get at once the
system's all put together this is
important not just for future expansion
possibilities but also just to make sure
I can plug in everything I'm going to
need to plug in because all these
commander pros have their own individual
SATA connector that needs to say to
power and that so it can distribute
additional power to all the fans of
stuff connected to it and even these
little breakout units there's two that
come with each three fan 120 millimeter
ll kits and these all have their own
separate SATA power connector as well so
I need to make absolutely sure I've got
plenty of SATA power connectors not just
for all that stuff and I'm gonna be
adding four mechanical hard drives each
will need a SATA adapter and then SSDs
as well so need lots of SATA power
this little added piece decided on this
actually just this morning so ideally
for the NASS we're gonna have all the
drives connected for big storage and
then there's going to be one SSD for the
bsd freebsd to run off of and that's
what FreeNAS runs on and then having a
cache drive is also very useful and just
recently obtained has been available and
obtained is actually pretty functional
as a cache drive for free Ness at least
what I've been reading this morning so
for now I'm gonna install this and this
is just to get it installed and then I
still don't have my main operating
system SSD for this yet so we'll wait
for that to arrive but this will at
least be ready to go also have not
confirmed the ECC memory I'm going to
use with this board yet so for now just
using this Corsair 3000 speed kits this
is a very good kit to use with Rison
very compatible works which has worked
with every Rison system I have put
together so far and runs at 3,000 speed
which is a very good speed to run for a
rising system
also I cut myself so I've bled for this
system the PC building gods have been
appeased
we're on another field trip that's
tradition for the riptides build series
we're headed to new egg
we'll call pickup right now to get my 8
terabyte mechanical hard drives four of
them thirty two terabytes total
it's about $1,300 after tax
money for storage but
I got a shoot in 4k you know
we've made it to the new a hybrid Center
and the way that you know your
professional new leg shopper if you come
to will call is that the ready for will
call pickup email came in while we were
on the way
and they get improved their hard drive
packaging the BT rids WT Reds look a lot
whiter than they used to for some reason
these are red pros which means that 7200
rpm and 8 terabytes each so back here on
the business end of the $1,000 that hide
the cable management area and I didn't
show the cable management area very much
at the end of the first build for good
reason look it's complete chaos back
here there's a good amount of space
width wise but you actually kind of
limited in that you don't have any cable
management area at the top or on the
front right up here okay fortunately
these French doors can lift up enough
this one was kind of stuck but I tried
the rear one before and that one was a
lot easier so there you go
so if you are doing a lot of work back
here you don't need to worry about those
swinging out and open also removing the
tempered glass piece itself is very very
helpful for it working back here now
right now what you're seeing is all the
cabling for that original builds I did
attach these extra cables from the
modular power supply so they'll be ready
for when they are needed but there's
more stuff that needs to go back here
we're going to add one more commander
Pro and that should be able to stick on
somewhere around there and then there's
also these little breakout units that
came with the ll series 120 millimeter
fans these come with the three fan kits
there's actually a couple of them so you
can plug this one if you're not going to
be using a commander or some other form
of control for the LEDs this will
control themselves and you can beezie
chain off of it this doesn't need its
own SATA connector but we're not going
to be using this piece we're just using
this and this can control LEDs for up to
six fans at once and then it will feed
over and connect up to the commander Pro
now the commander Pro you can connect up
to six PWM fans to you could use a like
a two fan splitter off of each of these
to connect up to twelve fans for example
but then you also have two LED control
connection points there and you can use
those to break out into those control
units that I already showed you up there
you have four temperature sensor
connection points so you can use us with
the included temp sensors and position
them wherever you want in your case and
then you get a couple USB 2.0 pass
throughs since USB 2.0 headers on
motherboards are becoming less and less
common in fact I believe my Zenith
Xtreme only has
one you can connect one up to the
commander Pro and then use this breakout
to connect other USB 2.0 control
necessary devices and that includes more
commander pros if you want to
daisy-chain them or you can also connect
up like the USB lead from the X 1600 eye
power supply for example so here's a
quick walkthrough of how you would
connect one of these Corsair ll series
fans if you want it to work first off
just like any normal fan for pin pwn
plug so you can plug that into your
motherboard or to one of the fan headers
on the commander Pro if you want the
Corsair link sufferer to be able to
command control and since the rotational
speed of your fans so that's the main
functional bits for the LEDs you have
this additional four pin header coming
off of the fan and then you have this
device known as the lighting node Pro
and this will come with that 3-pack of
fans that I have four of now it should
be noted that the commander over here
and the lighting node Pro have duplicate
functionality so if you have a commander
you don't necessarily need to use
letting node grow this is what confused
me first off because this is what you
actually get some power for and then you
also have a USB connector for that so
you can plug it in again to one of your
USB 2.0 headers on your motherboard but
if you look at the pin outs here there
are three pin headers whereas the fan
has a four pin header for your RGB
connection this is where I might start
to get a little confusing to set up all
your RGB because you've all got all
these different individual breakout
pieces but if I can try to explain this
simply once this has power and once it's
connected to your motherboard the RGB
header on here will help control one of
these and this has connection points for
up to six fans you should also pay
attention to the fact that these are
numbered and that numbering is actually
important because if you're doing fans
that are right next to each other and
you want them to all sort of blend
together and look like they're putting
on a fancy light show you need to tell
this controller which fan you are
connecting to which header now as
mentioned our commander Pro here has two
LED connection points so we can
basically ditch this breakout piece and
that is a little bit convenient for
making things slightly simpler so all
that is to say that there is a lot of
wiring and cable management that still
needs to go on back here not just for
the RGB LED fans but remember all these
hard drives and as
these that I also need to connect up to
so I've got some work ahead of me
fortunately the current version of this
build before all the water cooling stuff
goes in I have 12 RGB fans I'm going to
add eight total to the front so you guys
can get the full look of the front three
in the top and one in the back so that's
that equals twelve right yeah 12 and
what that means is I can use two
commander pros to connect six fans to
each one and then I also only need two
of these little breakout pieces to
connect up all the RGB LEDs to so I'm
going to go dive into my strategic zip
tie and velcro Reserve and then I'm
gonna attack this mess wish me luck
attempting to work smarter here rather
than harder I am labeling all of these
cables for the RGB LEDs so that
hopefully once this whole rack is
installed on the front of the case I'll
be able to plug these into the proper
connection points on the control box
 that's right I'm not sure
if you can tell whether or not I've made
any progress here Joe's help to mainly
everything was my idea now all the fans
of the front are mounted and I've gone
through and labeled all of the fan
headers the RGB ones with the proper
order they're supposed to be in one
three eight in the front up to 11 at the
top and then number twelve at the back
I'm also trying to separate this stuff
out right now so got my RGB LED cabling
off to the side over here power cabling
at the center and this will allow me to
hopefully get the power cabling routed
where I want it and kind of cinch it
down and out of the way
and then provide me a little bit more
room for mounting the LED stuff now
because there's another phase for this
build where I'm going to go ahead and
add the water cooling stuff I'm probably
not going to actually be able to mount
this up here like for instance I would
want to mount this other commander Pro
towards the front of the case so I'd
have easy connection for all these RGB
connection points but that would cover
where I need to get at to mount probably
double reservoir in the future so
probably just gonna have it hanging in
there but I'll at least have stuff
tidied to the point where it's at least
hanging out where it shouldn't be
I discovered a minor complaint with this
case here which is that the far right
power supply tray
really sticks in there I think it's
because when you pull it out it flexes a
little bit Bowl then it makes it bulge
out at the bottom and it's right up
against the flat metal plate and so it
just makes it more challenging to remove
so because I'm probably gonna need to
move my front commander Pro here I'm
trying a temporary mount solution Joe
suggested this was his idea just using
some velcro and I wrapped another strip
around the commander Pro just so I can
stick it there kind of hold it in place
it's not bad
all right so all i need's happened now
fans to plug into the hubs and then fan
leds to plug into these controller guys
alright guys I think we're at a point
where we can try out the fans that we've
connected up and give you guys a better
look at this case fully kitted out with
all of the ll series fans from Corsair
the cable management area here is much
improved I will note that there's a big
area here at the top that I haven't
tried to tie down again that's because I
need to come back in here when we
install the water cooling stuff and get
at some of the stuff so I didn't want to
tape everything down the way it should
be but all the fans are properly labeled
plugged into the LEDs in the proper
order so hopefully once the software
gets loaded up I can go and tell it what
order to do all the fancy RGB stuff in
gots to commander pros installed and
then I have this big grip of extra
cables down at the bottom tied away so
that when we add more stuff more SSDs
when I plug in these SSDs in the back
for example I've got the cables ready to
go for that now I did want to point out
that my intent today was to also get the
SFX power supply installed in there and
connect it up but I ordered it from
Amazon with one-day shipping and it's
supposed to get here today by like 8:00
p.m. so I'm probably going to need to
save that for the third video and the
third video is going to include include
the custom water cooling and I'm looking
forward to that but I still have to do
some measurements to get the cables and
also of course get all the water cooling
stuff on order and I can get all the
radiators pumps GPU blocks and maybe
even an upgraded CPU block for the
threader Brune 1850 x2 I think to close
out this video though we should probably
turn this system back on so you see what
those fans look like Joe can you assist
should show them our technique for
lifting it okay it's a two-man lift this
is Joe's idea it has hard drives in it
now - yeah
ooh let there be light
oh look they're in order so you can see
the color that this one turns becomes
the color on this one becomes the color
on this one in it it cycles alright
there's a train going by right now but I
will say it's always nice when you set
up a new system turn it on and the fans
automatically adjusts themselves back
down it's like really quiet right now in
this alright guys that is Riptide phase
2 now complete feels much more filled
out with all those fans in there
this being an extremely large case
really requires a lot of hardware to be
installed so the fans being one and I
still feel like there's a lot of empty
space up in the top but that will be
filled in once we get the water cooling
stuff in there so stay tuned for part 2
