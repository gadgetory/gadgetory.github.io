excellent hello everyone and welcome to
Paul's hardware this is a fairly
impromptu video because I just received
this this package in the mail from EVGA
and what this actually is is my back
plate for my GTX 970 so I'm going to do
what I hope is going to be a tutorial on
how to install this thing but honestly
if you can't already tell I have not
opened this I've actually not I can't
say I've never installed a back plate on
a video card before but definitely not
this particular model or anything like
that so let's see what comes in the box
nicely packaged all you have to do if
you so I did this for free because I
bought the 970 so I just had to register
that on EVGA website and then they they
have a temporary free upgrade plan going
on right now for the 970 but apart from
that you get to very very easily easily
laid out two color instructions here
remove the five circled screws indicated
below okay it's cool and this is
specific to the 972 so a nice nice
attention to detail here alright so the
screws are actually already there one
two three four five and then there's
some protective covering on the back
plates and you get a line the screws and
then you screw in the screws alright so
maybe this type of thing does not need a
tutorial perhaps this is so easy that
all I am doing is is talking at the
camera for your few minutes while I do
what is actually a fairly simple
installation but you know what I'm going
to press on if nothing else I'm going to
give you guys a look at this once its
installed
I like the backplate so far looks pretty
cool all right so this protective
covering on here it says to remove it
but you know what the screws are
actually the screws are not covered up
so I'm going to leave that on while I
install here's a protip right leave that
on while you do the installation I use a
Phillips head screw that's pro tip
number two oh yeah I'm gonna leave that
on while I do this installation maybe
that will help to to keep me from
getting it all fingerprinted up
um apart from this I did I had to
frantically well not frantically but
this package arrived and I was like ooh
I want to install this but maybe I
should do a video out of it but I just
had to go over there and pull this out
of the htpc everyone was excited that I
that I went and used the 970 in the HTPC
well they were either excited or they
were pissed off because it was crazy
overkill but um I did anyway and like I
predicted I was going to have to pull it
out very soon although I didn't pull it
out to run benchmarks I pulled it out to
install this backplate this screw
doesn't want to come out oh this one has
a nut a nut one second oh you know this
is attention to detail the mounting hole
closest at the top will need the
included net to secure the screw hold
the nut centered over the hole and
thread the screw through the nut this
will keep it in place so let's see they
even pointed that out to me I just
didn't read the instructions thoroughly
enough okay this is recommended type of
pliers for this activity there we go
just trying to keep things pretty okay
so screws have been removed there's this
they do have a bit of a bit of thermal
padding in there for contact with some
of the heat sinks or another heat sink
so that the pads will actually go over
some of the memory modules on there so
that's cool that provides ostensibly a
bit more functionality by maybe
providing a little bit more cooling for
those memory model maybe I can now
overclock my memory even more that'd be
sweet okay so got lined up there and now
we will just replace those five screws
this has been a riveting tutorial so far
right guys if anyone needs any special
tips on screws screwing in screws the
proper methods of doing so let me know
in the comment section because a how to
screw tutorial I think could be
something that I might I might decide to
put together some
at some point definitely has it been
requested but who knows maybe it was
just something that people didn't know I
was even considering doing maybe now
that I've mentioned its it will be the
most requested thing a screwing tutorial
okay one more this is the tricky one
with the nut again going to go with my
patented technique here folding the nut
with large oversized angle tipped pliers
and then like it's always easier to hand
thread a screw like this than it is to
just go right out with the screwdriver I
mean if you can get it you can get just
like a turn of two threaded and you know
it doesn't want to do it oh I am going
to need to use a screwdriver hold on
hold on haha success alright and there
we go back plate installed massive
upgrade and now the reveal of the EVGA
GeForce GTX 970 superclocked Edition
back plate there we go that's pretty
that's so pretty
so the EVGA it's got to cut out right
there GeForce GTX 970 on it sort of a
varied size of the holes there which
gives kind of a cool effect they're kind
of larger towards the center and they
get smaller towards the outside there
you can see the the backplate area
around the GPU itself that's very nice
and then they continue the design over
on that side so the look you're going to
get at your card now from the side
you're going to be seeing that that
goodness so provides extra protection I
think it looks a heck of a lot nicer
than just going with the bare PCB
besides that it's got this really really
great brushed metal finish black brushed
aluminum and again this was a hastily
set up video so I apologize if this
quality isn't fantastic but there is at
least a closer look at this EVGA back
plates so I will put a link in the
video's description guys if you're
interested in where I went on the EVGA
sights to get to this card or to get
this backplate I should say feel free to
sign up for one for yourself
I do think they improve the look of the
card and especially if you have a
visible graphics card like a side panel
or something like that very nice to have
but thank you all so much for watching
this video really appreciate it don't
forget to click all those links down in
the description they lead to useful
places for helpful things I don't forget
to hit the like button if you enjoyed
this video and we'll see you all very
very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
