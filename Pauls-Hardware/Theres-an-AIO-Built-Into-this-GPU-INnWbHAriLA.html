you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
coolermaster if you can't tell by the
massive RG logo I am now at the Asus
suite I'm gonna start off by showing you
guys this massive wall of sort of
disassembled laptops this is the rog
mothership GZ 700 and this is actually a
crazy new gaming laptop that asus has
been working on for quite some time and
I wanted to show you the parts of it
first because it's made of a CNC milled
piece of aluminum this is the monitor
actually itself and then there's a
keyboard piece so it opens up like no
laptop you've ever seen before the it's
got a little kickstand that pops out the
back and then you pull the keyboard off
the front and you could lay the keyboard
down in front and then you can also
detach the keyboard and fold it half and
half and use it as a wireless keyboard
so over there you have the front of the
mothership over here you have the back
of the mothership you can see the
massive cooling array they've done with
the heat pipes feeding over to the CPU
and GPU they created especially I see
it's better for the SSD and overall this
is just sort of a unique laptop that
I've never really seen anything like it
before so apart from the flexible setup
with the moveable keyboard wireless
factor and everything of course you can
also plug in your own keyboard like with
any laptop this is gonna have an eighth
generation Intel Core i 9 processor in
it it's not specified which one and a
geforce r-tx 2080 the display itself is
a 17.3 inch 144 hertz Full HD or 1080
display it's listed as IPS level which I
imagine means it's got pretty decent
color depth and it covers 80% of the DCI
p3 color gamut as for memory you can
have up to 64 gigs of DDR 4 you have up
to 3 PCI Express storage devices 512
geeks
each and they've done some crazy work
with Intel to make sure that two of
those have direct connect connectivity
to the CPU and the third goes through
the PCH that means you're actually
getting crazy read and write speeds on
your raid array here too
next up we have Joe for scale this is
the RG Strix XG 4 3 8q Asus always has
very catchy names for their monitors but
it's a 43 inch gaming monitor that
they've been working on 3840 by 2160 so
4k resolution as well as 120 Hertz
refresh rate so in sports AMD freesync -
it's actually compliant with the display
HDR 600 standard and features asus sonic
master technology delivers incredible
audio fidelity through - built in 10
watt speaker
to connect that you have DisplayPort
HDMI and USB 3.0 as well as a headphone
jack
it's a massive monitor and we don't know
when it's gonna launch they said they're
aiming for q2 we also have no idea how
much this is gonna cost you Austin Evans
us can you come over here okay wait
we're doing our first this is the first
official CES hog Evans guys everyone go
subscribe to Austin's YouTube channel
why would you do that that's a bad idea
I don't know stay right here keep it
locked for all the hottest latest the
greatest this is a sizzle reel right
here I don't even know I'm just guys
just awkwardly stay at the camera and
just until you know it gets weird kind
of hungry I am too actually yeah dinner
yet smash cut to knock here's another
laptop this is actually an Asus car as
far as the body goes so that's been out
for a while the thing we're actually
looking at here is the display and the
display is just showing the display
settings panel so it's not all that
exciting to look at the point is it's a
240 Hertz display on a laptop 1920 by
1080 so it's a resolution that you could
actually push a higher frame rate at and
Asus just wanted to let us know they
have this they're integrating it into
laptops and they're probably going to be
integrating it into more laptops they're
planning to do a few different tiers 240
Hertz as well as 180 Hertz so you have a
range depending on your preference and
I'm imagining also price difference but
there you go if you're excited about
high frame rate gaming on a laptop Asus
is probably gonna have you covered
pretty soon we've moved over to the
components side where it's actually not
set up yet we're here pretty early but I
wanted to actually pick this motherboard
out for the first time this is the ROG
Dominus extreme this is the new
motherboard for Intel's LGA 3647 3647
socket Intel's got the 28 core 56 thread
CPU that supposedly exists it actually
exists now could I buy it could I buy it
at retail right now probably not anyway
there's supposed to be crazy high-end
CPU from Intel that goes in here and
which they launched at the end of 2018
but this is the motherboard for it so
Intel supplying the CPU aside this
motherboard that's absolutely insane and
I have seen it before a couple times I
want to actually pick it up because it
probably weighs a good 20 pounds I'm
gonna say but Nick fortunately was able
to give us a quick rundown on what this
thing's actually sporting alright
this is our new ROG Dominus extreme
motherboard for LGA 36:47 socket you can
see it's a really heavy construction
it's got some really serious heat sinks
it's got a true 16 phase power design
you can see the three different CPU
power inputs at the top here on the
outside of the RAM slots we have
additional space for nvme SSDs through
the dim dot two sockets so that's a card
that we provide that you can add in two
more MB an nvme SSDs per slot and they
do get cooled if the heat sinks we have
the four-way spacing on the PCIe slots
supporting SLI and crossfire as well as
all of the other goodies that you would
expect including a screen on the top of
the i/o shield cover here which we call
our live dash panel which is
customizable o-o LED screen and then you
get your 10g internet you got a regular
cell 1g Nick and basically all the USB
connectivity that you want on top of
that ever all the user so I get very
excited about crazy overbuilt stuff like
this we still have no word on when this
will be available to like just go and
buy I did ask how much this would cost
when it's available and the answer
unofficially is more than you could ever
imagine
a motherboard costing but that it would
definitely be worth it so I'll need at
least three of these and lastly over
here in the corner is the best twenty
atti that asus is planning on making
this is the matrix it's currently lit up
nice and pretty right now I'm just going
to raw dog it and pull out of the slot
so here it is triple slot card
they are binning the GPUs that are going
in here so top five percents in terms of
performance and overclocked ability when
it comes to the GTX 220 atti GPU that
goes in there they got a nice saw
backplate on here they have RGB lighting
of course and then this has hybrid
cooling in fact everything is integrated
beneath this shroud here it's air-cooled
and there is an all-in-one liquid cooler
in here in fact the radiator you can
kind of see if you look at it from the
side extends along this cooling unit
right here you can look at it and see
some of the tubing for the pumps so the
pumps right there has copper contact
with the GPU itself you can kind of see
up along here and according to Asus this
is going to perform in the same ballpark
range it's like an all-in-one 240
millimeter cooler attached to your
graphics card but it's all here in one
unit with the triple slot card so that's
really cool design overall it's got gray
going on it's got some reflective areas
there too and then of course it does
light up when you actually have it
plugged in oh and this mirror part at
the top has the ROG logo with kind of a
3d effect so you can look down into it
almost forever but guys that is gonna
wrap it up for my first video here
actually in Las Vegas for CES 2019 I of
course want to say a big thank you to my
sponsors coolermaster Corsair deep cool
and inter max stay tuned because I have
a ton more coverage coming at you guys
so hit the thumbs up subscribe all that
good stuff I will make a playlist too
and link that in the description thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
