what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware today by popular demand I'm
going to be doing a review of this new
motherboard from Asus this is the asus
rog strict x 370 - f gaming and i've
actually been asked quite a few times to
review this motherboard I think there's
a couple reasons why I'll be doing an
unboxing going of the features and then
doing a setup and demonstration but
before we get into all that let's talk
about position in the marketplace
because when it comes to rise in people
investing they import platform I think a
lot of the draw for that is that it has
a very good price to performance ratio
and this board costing about a hundred
and ninety dollars as at retail as of
the filming of this video is not the
most expensive X 370 motherboard on the
market but it's definitely not the
cheapest either when it comes to
investing in rice and you've got the
super budget range which is about 75 to
100 bucks for a motherboard and that
will get you a micro ATX maybe be 350
motherboard and I'm only looking at be
350 and X 370 by the way because I think
you should stick with an overclocking a
bit a capable motherboard if you go with
Rison 5 horizon 7 and then the X 370
stuff which I think you should be
investing about 150 to 200 dollars in so
this is towards the high end of that but
again I think the reason why there's
been so much interest in this board is
because of the existence of this board
the crossfire 6 hero which has been used
for a ton of demonstrations overclocking
this was the initially introduced at
launch motherboard that was high-end
from Asus for Rison so you probably saw
a lot of coverage of this however this
one cost about 250 bucks so well it's
going to be the difference from the
quark crosshair 6 hero going to the X
370 - F gaming besides about $60 less
price so here's a look at everything
that comes in the retail box that's the
box that's the motherboard everything
else includes of course the manual and
user's guide you get a driver disk which
they still do these I guess I guess they
do you get a set of stickers so these
just some started blinking stickers with
RG Strix logos on them you know love
them or hate them they're there these a
little bit more useful rog cable labels
you can actually stick these on SATA
cables and that will allow you to more
easily tell from their point of origin
to drive they're connected to which is
which actually kind of like these hey
you can get 20% off of the cable mugear
if you want to get some RGB LEDs to go
along with your motherboard then over
here you get the more useful stuff so
for serial ATA cables in all black
that's nice to have you do get an
extension for your LEDs here it's only
one but it's fairly long so at least one
of your LED strips you could position a
little bit better in your case of course
have an i/o shield and I would say this
is a good one because it's got a nice
flat black finish on the back and
instead of being the cheapo version with
a little metal prongs stick out
everywhere that are annoying it's got
the nice squishy EMI protection there in
the backs that's nice to have a couple
tiny screws here the one I'm left there
is just going to be for your MDOT to
drive since you've only got one of those
on the board and then a couple more
small ones here these are for the 3d
printing mounting points that the ACS is
ready to put on some of their boards so
you got a couple of those for mounting
and then they've also included a high
bandwidth SLI bridge so HB SLI for
two-way SLI configurations and you know
it's not the prettiest one but it is
rigid PCB and if you are doing a two-way
SLI set that will get you up and running
oh and they've included some zip ties
too that's nice to have next let's run
down the board features I'm going to
start off by pointing out all the fan
headers so you get a total of seven on
the board and they're all four pin PWM
capable starting up with three right up
here in the top right two of them are
CPU main and CPU optional
you also have an a i/o pump option
that's right there moving all the way
down to the bottom right you got a
couple more down here one of these is
for a water pump and one of them is a
main even the ones that are labeled
water pump you can still connect fans up
to so don't worry about that but they
are also set up a little bit more so
they're suitable for AO pumps or if
you're doing a water-cooled build one
more chassis fan header down here in the
lower left and then one more chassis fan
header right here for an exhaust at the
rear so it gives you total set of seven
and you can access those via the fan
controls that are in the UEFI BIOS as
well as using the AC software as for
power delivery on the board here in the
left we can see there's two fairly
substantial heat sinks over the main
power delivery areas it's actually an
eight plus two power delivery
configuration the ACS has gone with
eight main phases for the CPU two more
phases for the SOC functions on the CPU
and then a pretty nice clean design
overall there's also an accent light
right here on the rear i/o and there's
actually multiple LEDs within that it
can change different colors to give you
a nice sort of contrasting look as its
switching between stuff or rainbow or
sort of the it works with a lot of
different effects features that are
available in the ACS or a software of
course you in the top right you have
your four ddr4 dimm slots for dual
channel ddr3 standard for any be 350 or
X 370 motherboard here's a 24-pin main
power connector for the motherboard
there is a USB 3.1 header right there
and that's actually coming straight from
the chipset so that's a native connector
and it is the new style connector that
Asus worked with it's we've seen it
implemented on a few more motherboards
lately but there are some case
manufacturers out there who are working
to get that header implemented on cases
as well and definitely a huge upgrade
over the standard USB 3 connector the
chipset heatsink is right here it's got
a nice clean look to it note that there
is no LED lighting on the chipset
heatsink that's actually one of the big
differences between this motherboard the
X 370 - F gaming and the be 350 gaming
so the X 370 has the accent light up
here the V 350 - F gaming has the accent
light on here and it can get blocked by
by graphics cards if you have dual slot
graphics cards in there so it's up to
you whether you think one is better than
the other but I do want to point out
that that'd be 350 - F gaming from Asus
costs only about 130 or 140 dollars MSRP
and even as of this morning I saw a new
egg for 109 plus a $15 million rebate
although it wasn't in stock so bear that
in mind if whether or not you can
actually find it now all rising CPUs are
going to give you 24 PCI Express gen3
lanes and here's basically how they're
configured four of them go directly to
the chipset to provide chipset functions
8 go to this top slot here actually can
do 8 or 16 all to the top slot here if
you're using a two-way configuration it
will be by
and in the top by eight and this one
here if you're counting up that's four
plus eight plus eight that makes twenty
gives you four left over and this four
left over ones are going to the m dot
two slot right here so you get a full
pci express gen3
by four connection four and m dot two
nvme drives down there and asus has
actually got all the way up to the one
ten lengths here so 2280 is going to be
pretty standard right there but even if
you have a longer n dot to drive you can
fit it so that's kind of cool
it is the only m dot two slot on the
board but that is pretty common with
these rides and setups simply because
there's not enough PCIe lanes without
using a splitter or something like that
but for most people a single m dot 2 m
vm e slot is all you're going to need
that's probably where your main SSD will
go with your operating system on it and
if you do decide that one isn't quite
enough for you you can get a riser card
and put it in the second expansion slot
here and that would work now as for the
PCIe lanes go into the chipset the chips
that has a bit of a splitter going in
there to break off certain stuff like
connection for SATA ports as well as USB
ports however it does also control these
two by one PCI Express gen 2 slots here
as well as the by 4 slot at the bottom
and bear in mind you can't use all those
at the same time so you can use this
slot and not use both of those or you
can use both of those and not that slot
the top slot fortunately has its own
connection so that doesn't conflict with
anything and then finally down here on
the bottom edge you have of course your
front panel connectors
previously-mentioned chassis fan headers
a couple USB 3.0 connectors so that's
nice if you have case it doesn't support
that USB 3.1 connector only a single USB
to head around here so bear that in mind
if you need a couple of these you might
want to get splitter from NZXT or
something like that there is a LED I'm
sorry not an LED but a temperature
header right here where you can connect
a diode and position that wherever you
want to new case to monitor some temps
and then of course you have the RGB LED
header there's actually two of these on
the board one of them is down here on
the bottom edge and then there's one up
here on the top edge as well so you get
the RGB accents on the i/o then you got
to RGB headers where you can add
additional RGB LED strips to your case
do
of course make sure you get a compatible
one from someone like cable mod or
fantex or something like that then
finally Hana bottom-left you get your
audio front panel header as well as some
of the supreme effects on your hardware
their audio great capacitors this is the
supreme effects s12 28 channel High
Definition codec in there has 120
decibel signal-to-noise playback and I
having 13 decibels signal to noise ratio
recording and then of course you can see
the connectors for that for a channel
out as well as an optical Toslink out as
well as the mic and of course rounding
things out here in the rear i/o you got
a couple USB 2.0 ports DisplayPort and
HDMI out if you happen to install an APU
on this those aren't available yet
they're going to be rising 3 APs
I'll talk about those when they come out
6 USB 3.0 ports that are natively
controlled by the chipset and Intel
Gigabit LAN a USB 3.1 connectors
actually two of them a full-sized type-a
as well as a Type C those are controlled
by an adze media add-on ship and then of
course the aforementioned audio
connections so here's a quick
side-by-side with the hero on the left
and the X 370 dash F on the right this
is by no means exhaustive but I really
quickly wanted to point out some of the
differences between the boards as well
as the similarities you might notice
that the layout is going to be extremely
similar between the two of these
especially if you look at the layout of
the PCI Express expansion slots over
here they both work the same way they
both have the same m dot to support
right down here the big difference is
with the crosshair 6 here are going to
be you have a bit more connectivity and
points down here for doing stuff like
engaging L into slow mode compatibility
with the RG extender for example and you
do get a bit more connectivity on the
i/o this is the crosshair up on top so
you get a couple more USB 3.0 ports a
couple more USB 2.0 ports you don't get
the video outs but I don't think that's
a big deal since we're not too worried
about the are three processes right now
same connection points as far as
Ethernet and USB 3.1 but on a crosshair
you do get a rear-mounted bios reset
button as well as I believe this is for
a memo Kay function which you can
activate as well and that's actually
pretty helpful
of course you're also going to get a
better power delivery configuration on
the crosshair and the X 370 dash F
gaming
is missing a few other key useful
features you can get by without these
but I do like to have them
there's no LED post indicator up here in
the top there's no surface mount of
power reset button this down here at the
bottom and holy crap I almost forgot to
mention this but another similarity that
this board shares with the crosshair six
hero and especially when it comes to
board layout is it has support for am-3
mounts so right now that's careers lined
up at the am for mount you notice that
hole right there that lines up with a m3
so if you have an older heat sink fan or
something like that that only has a m3
and not a m4 yet you can mount it to
this motherboard although do bear in
mind that when you're going at that up
with that route often you will need to
maintain the a m4 back plate or an three
back plate a lot of the CPU coolers
actually use this one that come comes
with the motherboard so you might need
an am three back plate for this board if
you go with an m3 cooling solution so
after putting in a bit of elbow grease I
have managed to get my test system all
put together so I can demonstrate some
of the lighting as well as some of the
functionality of this motherboard and
now the components i'm using are the
fantex
and through pro old-school case has had
this one for a while so it was just on
hand and easy to use
enter max cooler that is the 80s T 40 no
RGB on that one so it's just they're
kind of getting the job done keep things
cool incidentally I did use the a and
three mount for that so taking advantage
of the m3 mounting holes on this
motherboard for memory I have the G
scale credenzie kit that's one of their
RGB kits this is actually a 4 by 8 gig
kit but I only installed two of the 8
gig Stix is rated for 3200 speed caps
latency 14 and I was able to plug those
values in then get the memory to work
just fine so hopefully that is a
testament to increased memory support
and compatibility I did also update to
the latest bios version a zero eight
zero eight which is available on the
Asus website for storage I just have the
Patriot Hellfire 480 gig nvme SSD and
then to sort of flesh out the RGB
features on the system I have installed
an Asus GTX 1080i which also has RGB
lighting and then I did add a cable mod
RGB LED strip which I have just sort of
we placed along the bottom of the case
just to show the connectivity there as
well
once everything is plugged in and up and
running it's just a matter of getting
into Windows 10 and loading up the asus
or a software and depending on the
hardware you have connected the asus or
a software may or may not be able to
address it i haven't use all hardware
that's compatible so it can control the
g.skill trend and the RGB memory as well
as the asus graphics card of course the
LEDs on the motherboard and the LEDs on
the RGB strips that edit at the bottom
of the case i've already gone over the
software before but asus has continued
to update it and develop it so this is
definitely a great option for anyone who
is looking to build not just a nice
high-end gaming pc but also to customize
a little bit with the beauty and majesty
of RGB LED lighting and I think this
configuration is pretty nice because you
could also as I always like to say turn
them all off - if you decided that you
got sick of them
or you just wanted to get some shut-eye
so with all that said let's wrap up this
video with some pros and cons the pros
for the X 370 - F gaming are going to be
that at 60 bucks less than the crosshair
6 hero while providing you with most of
the functionality you get with that
motherboard second I really like that
it's got that USB 3.1 front panel
connector it's also got excellent BIOS
support asus has already done three
different BIOS versions of this board
just in the past few weeks and you do
get a nice SSD secure race function in
the BIOS this one of those little added
extras that I like memory support at
higher frequencies is also very
important with Rison and we're seeing
great support from Asus with this board
as well and then finally RGB
implementation you know I've seen
blinging your boards when it comes to
RGB but I like what they've done with
the accent up here having to RGB headers
is great and for anyone who is looking
to get an awesome gaming computer as
well as getting that RGB functionality
in as well I think you'll be pretty
happy with this board as well as the
coordination that you can get if you get
an Asus graphics card as well as for
comms though I do have a few of them and
the first is going to be the price it's
190 bucks and that's still a decent
twenty to forty bucks cheaper than you
can get other comparable X 370
motherboards for also if you go back to
my top five favorite motherboard
features video that I did just a couple
weeks ago you'll notice that actually
four of the five of those features
aren't included on this board no surface
mounted power and
buttons no debug LED no rear CMOS clear
button that's easily accessible right
there either and no USB bios flashback
which is just one of my favorite Asus
features I don't know why they're not
including it on these AMD boards so far
but you do have at least a USB BIOS
recovery option that you can get into if
your BIOS gets corrupted it's just not
the same function where you don't need a
CPU and memory as USB BIOS flashback and
how that works so guys that is my review
of the X 370 - F gaming definitely an
excellent motherboard to add to a
Seuss's lineup on the AMD side and I
think great to have a lot of these
options and the look and feel of the ROG
motherboards without having to pay that
premium that you had to pay for the
crossfire cigs hero I think this would
be a great motherboard for something
like a rise in seven CPU stepped a
little bit more higher-end that's not
necessarily to say you couldn't put an
r5 in here either just bear in mind that
if you are looking for the best bang for
your buck this might not be exactly the
board you're looking for this one's a
little bit more blingy a little bit more
higher high-end but if you wanted an RGB
build and you want something a little
bit fancier I think this would be a
great choice for you thanks for watching
this video guys of course hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed it
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
