inch 21 by 9 ultra wide screen IPS
curved monitor with g-sync variable
refresh rate technology from Nvidia
built into it it can also be overclocked
up to 100 Hertz refresh rate many people
myself included have been waiting for
this confluence of features in a display
but is the $1,300 MSRP too much to ask
for what Linus has already called the
best gaming experience you could put on
your desk
granite II says a lot but let's find out
mass drop has a drop going on right now
for the Ergo tech freedom arm it's a
desk mounted articulating monitor arm
that supports up to 27 inch displays
allowing you full control over your
monitors position while using almost no
desk space as long as you got a hundred
by hundred or 75 by 75 bays amount click
the sponsor link in the video's
description down below or go to dr o PS
slash paul's hardware to find out more
I'm also going to link Dimitri's ergo
tech freedom arm review video on
hardware connects down there because he
did a really great job reviewing it once
again that's dr o dot PS / paul's
hardware and a big thank you to mass
drop for supporting my channel back to
the Acer predator x 34 tho which has
actually been available in limited
quantities for about a month or so now
although I have been told that there
will be a wider release with more retail
units available around December 12th
this afforded me the opportunity to go
over some of the other reviews that are
out there before I did my review
including Linus's on - tech tips as well
as J's - cents and joker productions as
they all managed to get their hands on a
Predator X 30 for links to all three of
those videos are also down in the
description and while you're down in
that area don't neglect to that like
button it gets so lonesome sometimes one
final note before we get into the meat
of this video and the interest of full
disclosure is that this monitor was
provided to me by Nvidia for this review
I am of course extremely thankful to
them for that but at the same time I
promise all of you that this fact will
not affect my opinions or how closely I
scrutinize the predator X 34 at first
glance the x 34 definitely has that edgy
look that manufacturers seem to
associate with PC gaming which I guess
must work because they keep doing it
Acer keeps things pretty tasteful though
in my opinion with a couple dark red
color accents on the logo and the stand
being the blingiest thing on there
at second glance though you will find
that there is also this under glow light
when you turn it on which is also blingy
but also pretty cool it can do five
different colors red green blue a yellow
orange or goldish color and white it's
very nice again but I would love to see
full RGB support added maybe in a future
firmware update the stand itself is made
of metal steel actually and it has a
very helpful handle up at the top cable
management hold down at the bottom with
the red exit and very wide twenty feet
that do take up a lot of desk space but
it makes up for that by being a very
solid stand with a good amount of height
control as well as tilts to swivel you
simply lift and move the whole stand
which is works but it's not very
convenient and for the first time ever
I'm able to say when I'm looking at a
monitor stand that you don't need pivot
it's just not needed setting this thing
up vertically would pretty much be
pretty silly anyway the back of this
monitor is black glossy plastic which
should never be used on anything but at
least I don't have to look at it since
it's going to be the part that faces the
wall a 100 by 100 base amount is back
there good work acer on that and for the
pluggy area there's your AC power plug
Kensington lock headphone jack which is
not really conveniently located but it
does give you an option for audio aside
from the built-in speakers which are
seven watts and ok for monitor speakers
if that means anything there's a 4 port
USB 3.0 hub back here too which is nice
to have I guess again it's not really
conveniently located some of you might
like it for routing a keyboard and mouse
through but given the choice between
that USB 3.0 hub and a lower price on
the monitor I would have gone for the
lower price for sure finally for inputs
there is a familiar and comforting
full-size DisplayPort 1.2 connector and
an HDMI port which I just assumed would
be HDMI 2.0 but I was actually kind of
disappointed to learn as only one point
4 you can still get the full resolution
with HDMI 1.4 but you're limited to 50
Hertz refresh rate or 60 Hertz if you
overclock it a little bit it's nice to
have that as a second input but I just
would not use it for gaming the screen
is 34 inches diagonal with a matte
finish 21 by 9 aspect ratio and 34 40 by
1440 resolution that's four point nine
five million pixels for those of you who
doing math so you're gonna need a $500
plus graphics card to get reasonable
frame rates while gaming on this monitor
presumably if you're willing to spend
1,300 on this monitor then you're going
to be ok with that but it is still a bit
less taxing than 4k fortunately which is
about 8.3 million pixels for comparison
I would also have to assume that you'd
be getting or already have an Nvidia
graphics card like a nine eighty or
ninety Ti to go with this because this
monitor has g-sync which is mat matches
the FPS output of your graphics card
with the monitors refresh rate makes
everything really smooth and it only
works with NVIDIA GPUs if you're going
for an AMD card well there is the Acer
XR 3 4 1 CK which is nearly identical to
the predator X 34 except it doesn't have
a cool predator name it tops out at 75
Hertz instead of a hundred and it
features free sync support instead of
g-sync so it works with AMD it can be
found for less money though about $1,100
as of the filming of this video
200 bucks more for this one maybe for
maybe they've been the panels and the
hundred Hertz panels you know they value
more I don't know if that's my guess now
I'm not going to argue the finer points
of free sync versus G sync in this video
but I will say that in either case once
your eyes have tasted the sweet nectar
of variable refresh rate technology no
other drink will ever save their thirst
the bezel is very thin but the display
is inset just a bit I'm actually pretty
used to this with monitors by now
they've been doing it for several years
with all brands it seems it is shown
pretty clearly in a search product
photos where the screen actually ends in
the bezel begins but just an FYI for
anyone who is really expecting an
edge-to-edge screen on this one it's
it's not that finally you've got the
curve it is less curved than some other
monitors I've seen out there but
actually I think it's pretty ideal and
this is coming from someone who really
doesn't like curved televisions
depending on how close you sit to them
the far corners of ultra wide monitors
in particular can start to taper away at
the edges of your field of view more
significantly than a 16 by 9 screen like
a 1080 or 4k the x34 s-curve compensates
for that tapering without being
noticeable when you're sitting at a
comfortable distance and I just liked it
I thought it worked well it wasn't a
distraction for me and lastly there is a
blue light
action mode that you can enable called a
sir I protect that is all for these
specs and features of the predator x34
though let's actually put it through
some tests and real-world usage so the
first thing I wanted to do was go ahead
and enable that hundred Hertz mode the
monitor actually ships at sixty Hertz
and overclocking it to 100 Hertz is
something that you do via the on-screen
display you enable that mode the monitor
does a quick reset and then you can go
into your Windows display settings and
turn up the hundred Hertz mode using the
blur Busters website you can go ahead
and check and make sure that you're
actually achieving hundred Hertz
fortunately my monitor was able to hit
that just fine and I have had no issues
running at this refresh rate ever since
I enabled it next up I wanted to look at
the color range as well as banding and
backlight bleed this is a little bit
subjective because I don't necessarily
have the color calibration tools to go
on top of the monitor to get proper
readings but I can tell you that this
will achieve 100% of the srgb gama which
is very nice that's thanks to it being
an IPS monitor with excellent color
depth fortunately i also had no color
banding across mine which is another
issue that came up on some of the forums
the transition between colors appeared
nice and smooth to me i do have a bit of
black backlight bleed and inconsistency
though it's along the top right and the
top left of the monitor when i'm looking
directly at a black screen and this is
an issue that's been reported with quite
a few different monitors i've definitely
seen worse but i've definitely seen
better when it comes to backlight bleed
as well and this being a very expensive
monitor i was a little bit disappointed
with that fortunately it's really not
noticeable except when you're looking at
a very black screen and as i was playing
through games and not concentrating and
looking for that it never came up with
something that was strongly noticeable i
had to play some games of course this is
where the monitor really shines it is a
gaming monitor with gsync and especially
especially if the game actually supports
21 by 9 but not all games do grand theft
auto 5 is one that i've probably spent
the most amount of time playing on the
smarter just because it supports it
pretty natively i didn't really have any
issues the UI is shrunk down a little
bit in still in sixteen by nine mode
mode but it was just fine
another game that I got recently that is
really excited about a Starcraft for PvP
purposes that's limited to 16 by 9 so
you are going to be hit and miss as
you're looking for games to play some
games that are sixteen by nine
still going to run but you're just going
to be looking at black bars on either
edge of the screen or you're going to
have to go in and fiddle with some ini
settings or something like that to get
it to actually run at 21 by 9 when 21 by
9 is supported combining that with
g-sync as well as the IPS colored apps
here leads to just an amazing fabulous
and wonderful gaming experience that
point I would like to drive home because
I know I've been trying to like show you
guys all of the potential negatives with
this monitor for anyone who's really
considering dropping that 13 Hendo on it
but I got to come back to that over and
over again the gaming experience on this
when everything's working right is
absolutely amazing I also had the chance
to use this monitor for some streaming
so gaming and streaming at the same time
one thing that I will say is that when
you're gaming at 21 by 9 I used OBS to
just capture the 60 M by 9 portion of
the screen for streaming that worked
just fine that was using a secondary
monitor if I was using just a single
monitor and I was stuck with a 16 by 9
game but I would actually do is play it
in windowed mode so you still have some
screen real estate on either side and my
idea was to pull up maybe your twitch
chat or maybe like your twitch or your
youtube UI have that off to the side so
you can kind of keep an eye on on the
same screen while you're gaming it's a
good use of the space when you can't use
it otherwise for non gaming scenarios
such as photo and video editing the
color depth is also fabulous to have
don't roll out movie watching as well
though the ultra wide screen is much
more akin to the letterbox aspect ratio
that you get when you're watching films
in the theater just bear in mind that
most movies that you can get via blu-ray
or DVD are 16 by 9 aspect ratio so
you're going to need to look for your
own source material and you're probably
going to need to look for a software
playback player such as VLC that can
handle removing black bars cropping and
adjusting aspect ratio and finally I
tried to get some actual work done by
firing up Adobe Premiere and checking
out video editing on this monitor this
is a serious contender for ultra wide
vs. say if you're using two or three
monitors in a multi monitor
configuration right now which is really
great for productivity I personally
still like multi monitor but J for
example has ditched his three monitor
maybe even four monitors set up just for
this single display yeah it's kind of up
to your preference but I will say that
being able to put stuff side-by-side on
here to look at you know webpage on one
side while doing something else on the
other whatever you want to do for your
multitasking is fantastic and it is a
serious contender and an option for
those of you who have been working with
multiple monitors now before I move into
the conclusion parts I need to make note
of what seems to be some ongoing quality
control issues with the Acer predator X
34 I only experience these when it comes
to the backlight bleed which was again a
little bit disappointing but not a game
breaker for me others have had not as
good of experiences though and I found
this via a review posted on new egg like
literally yesterday ongoing complaints
on the Acer forums as well as some of
the other review sites that I looked up
that I don't recall right now but those
are linked in the description down below
if you want to check them out
I found a range of issues that had been
reported some of them were minor some of
them were really issues that I
personally would not live with if I had
just dropped $1300 on a monitor
fortunately acer is very active on their
own forums and for people who are
experiencing game-breaking issues they
are reaching out to them to work with
the replacements and that kind of thing
under the monitors warranty which is
three years from Acer so by that in mind
some folks were having issues with color
banding across the monitor especially
when they're watching looking at some of
those gradients there were some issues
with some of the build quality as far as
the construction down here along the
edges I also saw some people complaining
of electrical noise or coil whine
although I have experienced none of that
here again the backlight bleed issue was
the only thing that really popped up is
something that I was a less than happy
with bearing all that in mind though
let's move to the conclusion I'm gonna
do a cons list and a pros list and let's
I'd like to remove the band-aid first
let's start off with cons and the first
obvious con is oh my god the price there
are definitely other cost-effective 21
by 9 options out there other than the
ACR predator ex 34 not all of them have
the exact list of features that this one
has so I think that's why a sir feels
like they can price it at the price
point that they have and just to point
this out these are sold out everywhere
so clearly people are buying them even
at that price so we'll leave it at that
next up was the overclock speed I didn't
quite understand why they didn't just
ship it at 100 Hertz rather than
starting it at 60 and having you
overclock it yourself maybe that
has something to do with warranty issues
or anything Jay mentioned this one as
well but I already kind of noted my
theory that they're bending the panels
and they're using the ones that don't
overclock as much for the freesync
version and the better overclocking ones
for this one just a theory but wanted to
throw it out there 21 by 9 game support
is definitely a con just in that not all
games support it and some games are just
stuck other games you have to go through
some leaping through some hoops in order
to get that to work I would say it would
be nice to have the HDMI 2.0 on there to
have that versatility and flexibility
for multiple display connections Jerry I
know you've been having some issues with
those two display connection options
recently although not with this
particular monitor the on screen display
menu is pretty bad and just confusing
it's hard to navigate around once you
figure it out it's it's usable but it's
still pretty bad the black glossy
plastic on the black back I don't like
it I'm glad I don't have to look at it I
would love to see more colors on the
under glow light and then the
aforementioned quality control issues
which again are hit and miss let's move
on to pros though because there's
definitely some really big pros even
though I think the actual list is
shorter so first off just 34 inch 21 by
9 34 40 by 1440 is pretty fricking
amazing it's just a beautiful balance
between the size of the display and the
resolution even simple things like the
icons being like the reasonable size and
that kind of thing 100 Hertz g-sync is
also pretty amazing combined with those
first things that I mentioned I have not
done extensive side-by-side testing of
like 100 Hertz versus 144 or something
like that but just subjectively I do not
notice much of a difference when you're
especially with G sync between 100 and
144 and I would say that I will take a
hundred Hertz IPS over 144 Hertz TN any
day but that's because I like color
depth also the curve I think they did a
really good job with it's a pretty ideal
level of curvature without being
overdone it is definitely more
appropriate to curve a 21 by 9 monitor
than a 16 by 9 the matte finish is
beautiful I would have hated a glossy
finish on this it's still somewhat
glossy but it's mostly matte and then of
course you got that IPS color gamut
hundred-percent srgb wide viewing angles
which is also nice for a curved monitor
and and yeah that's that's a pretty good
list of pros I think and let's finish
off with some final closing thoughts
first off the price yes it is very high
but I will point out that there is a
market for these because they're sold
out everywhere I don't know take that
for what it is quality control issues
definitely suck and it was disappointing
to read some of those as I was doing
research for my review on this monitor
fortunately I didn't hit those too bad
but I would definitely recommend if
you're gonna buy this buy from somewhere
that has a good return policy if they
charge a restocking fee when you return
it you might want to reconsider because
that's a 15% of 1300 is pretty expensive
some places like Newegg you can call in
and like talk them into waiving it
anyway I'll leave that in your hands
finally you probably want to know if I
would buy this myself for $1,300 since
Aaron mentioned that this came over from
Nvidia I would say no but I'm not their
target market I don't typically spend
this much money on a display for example
last display I bought that was a big
investment for me was the 700 ish
dollars that I spent on my yarmulke see
leonidas which was two and a half years
ago but if you're seriously thinking
about this monitor and you have the
money and the cons don't deter you
you're in for an amazing amazing gaming
experience I have to keep referencing
that and hopefully now you will know
what to expect when it comes to the pros
and the cons anyway guys if you enjoyed
