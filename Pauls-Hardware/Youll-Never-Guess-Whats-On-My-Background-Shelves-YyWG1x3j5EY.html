learn more what's up guys how's it going
- welcome to pauls hardware for today's
video I'm going to be talking about all
the stuff on my shelves in the
background and if you're wondering why
I'm doing this video it's a couple of
reasons first off I'm actually leaving
relatively soon to go over the Pacific
Ocean to Asia I'm actually gonna be
spending a little bit of time in Japan
and then heading on to Taipei Taiwan for
Computex
and I have quite a bit of work to do
before I leave so today I'm gonna cover
a couple quick updates on projects that
I have that are ongoing and then I also
tweeted out a poll earlier today asking
what you wanted the content to be for
today's video since I needed something I
could put together relatively quickly
the tie was between what's in the
background or what I have in my shelves
here and I've been asked this several
times by multiple people on well I'd
shown otherwise and then the other
option was a cable management video and
I wasn't actually talking about cable
management in a computer I was talking
about cable management for a desk and
like under the desk and getting a nice
clean set up and that kind of thing I'm
not going to be doing that video today
but I will do it in the future since
people were interested in it I had to be
the tiebreaker since there was 40% vote
for either choice but let's start off
with an update about this big old system
behind me so this is Riptide if you
didn't already see the videos on Riptide
there's a couple already in my recent
videos list so check those out I was
waiting on this power supply to arrive
this is the SF 600 power supply that I
needed in order to power the secondary
system in here a little mini ITX system
that's gonna be a FreeNAS setup and the
reason I needed this was so I could do
measurements for my cables and the
cables are gonna be done by woz mods and
he's already got the measurements that I
gave him I did so by taking a length of
sleeving that I already had measuring
from wherever the cable needed to go
down to the plug on the power supply
either under here or back over here this
is where the secondary power supply sits
for the mini system and once I got both
of those
in I was able to measure and get the
measurements for the two eight pins up
here the 24 pin to eight pins on either
of the graphics cards yes I will be
doing another graphics card in here once
they're water cooled I'll be able to fit
all the stuff in there as well as 24 pin
and eight pin for this little system
down here I've also confirmed that alpha
cool is gonna be doing the water cooling
stuff inside there so I have actually
been delaying on following up with them
and giving them the actual list of stuff
I need long story short this probably
isn't gonna be finished until after I
get back from Computex so apologies for
that
but onto this little guy this is
originally my $500 build I recently
updated it to make it a $900 build I
recently spent our hour-and-a-half
streaming from this system with this
current setup for about nine hundred
dollars and I have one final video on
this system coming up with some
benchmarks and some testing both
streaming and not streaming so stay
tuned for that video should be up in
just a couple days so that is a pretty
long intro but let's move on to the
actual meet of this video what do I have
up on my shelves here I built these
shelves I built most of the stuff that's
out here featured in garage work logs
like these are IKEA table tops and some
stands down there I'll link to my garage
work logs video if you guys want any
more information on the stuff that's
behind this like my big cupboard over
there and the roof rack up above I also
painted the walls at least behind here I
didn't do everywhere you'll notice the
older uglier gray color up to there if I
actually ever point the camera that
direction added the foam sound-dampening
here on the edges just to provide a
little bit less echo in here and of
course added the LED backlighting behind
the shelves to give it a bit of pop so I
think to keep things organized here make
sure I don't forget anything I'm gonna
move from right to left across the
shelves I'm gonna start on the bottom
and then I'll move up and up and then up
one more time so on the very bottom down
here
Rison box as well as an Nvidia box and
these were actually both sent by vendors
AMD for this one and NVIDIA for the one
down there this was to promote the
thread Ripper launch so the thread
Ripper CPUs came in that and it was
supposed to light up when you opened it
and everything but it's also like a
actual really nice Pelican case I have
not repurposed this for anything yet I
might start storing all my camera gear
and stuff in there eventually and then
there's a smaller one from Nvidia this
is from the order of 10 and this was
that when the 10
series of GPUs launched two years ago
and actually have been using that one
I put camera gear in it whenever I need
to take it on a trip and I need to put
camera gear in a checked bag I put it in
there and it stays much safer it's
pretty much all there is to talk about
for the bottom down here there is a UPS
over there over here you have keyboards
mice sound board this is all stuff that
I use on a fairly regular basis which is
why it's all out and scattered about
right now so I'm not going to spend too
much time on this but I will say that
over here these are mostly CPUs over
here we've got a few random pieces of
camera gear my zoom h6 for audio my
lx100 which I'm using less and less now
that I got my rx100 microfiber which I'm
using to record this actual video and
then of course arctic panther here in a
corner getting the job done here's one
of my mouse Matt's just just some
shameless product placement here I guess
I should also grab that look also bottle
openers cool and then some graphics
cards the Vega 56 this is the 1080 TI
Strix from Asus that is temporarily
removed from Riptide and then this is my
horas 1080 TI that died
oh no so sad about that and then finally
my praxis wet bench from primo chill
I've had this for quite some time you
can order these in a bunch of different
colors I have the whites with gray
accents and this is a cool piece of kit
I mean if you do a lot of outside of the
box testing not only is it pretty
functional for getting a water cooling
setup going and you can remove these
panels and you can remove the panel here
for example I recently just pulled the
water cooling loop off of this because I
installed it in Riptide also I
apparently I forgot to clean off my 1920
X it's just let's just take care of that
right now
that's much prettier now okay I feel
better moving up from there though we
have my data as Sherlock Holmes picture
actually I had one of these that I got
directly from brent Spiner at a Star
Trek convention that I went to with my
wife and then this was replaced with a
signed version and I have to issue a
huge apology here because this came at a
fan meetup as well as Deadpool over
there and the fan meetup was just so
whirlwind that I don't remember exactly
who come here the signed version of this
so I apologize for that but I do really
like my data as Sherlock Holmes signed a
picture right there
moving up here and
this is kind of tucked away I feel like
I should find a better spot for this but
this is my 100,000 subscriber YouTube
black hopefully maybe in another year
ish gonna get the 1 million subscriber
version of that the middle shelf op
actually has a bunch of awesome stuff
the scrapyard wars season 5 loser trophy
very very proud of that one even though
technically we won but we're still
waiting for the courts to appeal that
this is a little cooler master dude that
I got Computex a couple years ago this
little box was sent by tech syndicate
the Tek syndicate forums so thanks
thanks to tech Tek syndicate forums
behind all these we have some older
motherboards so this is just an old p5
and D motherboard which I just had there
because I used that board and quite a
few builds back in the day it was a
really solid one this is a classic
though this is a dfi LAN party NF for
the in for support chipsets socket 939
back when AMD was kicking ass in the
mid-2000s around I think around 2006 was
when this board came out they did this
is actually when they started to be like
hey we should make products specifically
for gamers and they made it like it's UV
reactive and stuff this is just an old
random heatsink that's strapped to that
for some reason and on this board which
doesn't really have any particular claim
to fame other than that it's an m2 plus
m3 board that handles some older CPUs
and also has a built-in graphics so I
was using that to rehabilitate some old
CPUs and somehow it ended up up on this
shelf below that stock heatsink fans
gotta have a collection of those
including like an LGA 2011 one and
remember when Intel stock heatsink fans
had a copper block this size on the
bottom of it Wow
yeah that was before precious metals
started to cost more money
oh wait I'm getting these confused this
is the LGA 2011 one right here there it
is that's a that's a classic and then
the old-school AMD one just because it's
fun look I've got my lightsaber here
it's the force effects one so it makes
noise when you wave it around and you
know that kind of thing got this for my
Halloween costume this year which was a
massive hit here's my ukulele I should
play this more often this is an Idlewild
ukulele it's made by monoprice and my
wife got it for me my wife works at mana
price in case you're wondering and I
like it I can play it
a little bit although I haven't very
often this is a breast implant yes my
friends you heard me right this is an
old-school saline prefilled breast
implant and back when I used to work at
Newegg many many years ago I feel like
in the 2006 was about this was shipped
there and we couldn't figure out where
it shipped from or who it came from they
only sent us one not two we discovered
it's indestructible and somehow I ended
up with it over time so I'm gonna keep
this forever and you know if nothing
else that works as a great glorified
stress ball next up is Deadpool in the
grey outfit I believe this is by Funko
and this was a fan gift at the fan
meetup last year and I again apologize
for not knowing the name and realizing
that when I get gifts I need to like
write the name down if who gave it to me
so I can offer my proper thanks but
thank you nonetheless for the great
Deadpool he's he's doing a great job
here in the background next to that is
this plastic balloon animal somebody
discovered that I have the capability to
twist balloon animals and sent this we
opened it on mail time during awesome
hardware it's got the bones and
internals of a balloon animal dog which
I thought was pretty cool so I actually
finally put that together there is an
axe up here this is a foam axe and this
was actually from Blizzard at Blizzcon
that one of the first ones I went to
which I feel like was back in 2008 maybe
2009 and this is actually from the
Nvidia booth I should say so it wasn't
technically a blizzard it was Nvidia at
Blizzcon it's actually pretty nice
quality although it is starting to flake
and deteriorate a little bit on some
parts because it's getting a little bit
old but I thought I would include that
with my armory up here next to that is
my machete and I've had that since high
school and I used to use it to like
grill with and stuff like that so now
it's just my machete in the background
we've gotten back over to computer
hardware so I'm not gonna dwell too much
on this more CPUs storage m2 drives
right here more SSDs SSDs these boxes
have CPU slot covers USB drives and SLI
bridges and memory I've labeled them so
I know what's what 3.5 inch drives more
memory 2.5 inch drives and SSDs and
Intel look for some reason old laptop
and tablet that I should really figure
out something better to do with oh look
we got an NZT NZXT pucker
there these are all stock heatsink fans
that are still in their boxes of various
different types look old optical storage
old CDs burnable CDs I even have some
actual music CDs up here clam shells
that kind of thing old hard drives 3.5
inch and older ite drives optical drives
more CPUs and stuff also the Devourer D
lighting kit for LGA 1155 class Intel
CPUs 1150 1151 I actually kind of made
use of this I have a video on the back
burner that I should probably follow up
with about that more random stuff
webcams controllers these are my risin 5
and 7 2600 X and 2700 X boxes that is
the builds that we won a scrapyard war
Season 5 with or that we should have won
scrapyard war season 5 with Linus took
all the useful stuff out of it like the
CPU and stuff but I still got the
motherboard and the and the power supply
and of course the case itself the Cal
did such a great job decorating with all
of the various multi colored electrical
tape this I had to take down because I
get so many random questions about it
from time to time this is Castle
Grayskull
original Castle Grayskull from when I
was probably eight years old or
something like that it still has a lot
of the original stuff inside although
not everything including the throne it's
even got the whole rope on the elevator
thing you can pull that and bring the
elevator up I always thought this part
was cool too it's got a trapdoor so you
like you turn the it's like you're
sitting in the throne and your subject
is here in front of you so you just turn
the throne and then get dropped down to
I guess one one-story lower or whatever
but one of the toys from my childhood so
many memories and now we're in the
homestretch these are all graphics cards
people have noticed these many times in
the past and this is usually where I get
the comments of like what are you doing
with all those graphics cards in the
background you should give them to me
they're useful that is kind of true but
this is mostly a GPU graveyard f cards
here that I'm either never going to use
again that I'm keeping for nostalgic
purposes or that are just straight-up
debt so on the far left the original
GPUs the two gtx 980 s from the original
arctic panther next to that a couple
rx4 60s they were used in SOI I believe
those still work but the rx 460 is not a
very power efficient or useful card
anymore this is an EVGA GTX 260 that I
actually used for quite some time played
lots of WoW on that one a couple of
these twin frozer two GPUs from MSI and
I have these because this is when I
thought I'm excited it was doing a
really good job with that coolers for
one thing these are also our x4 60s and
one of these works and one of them
doesn't and since they're actually the
same card I thought why not keep them as
a pair I had to double-check these but
this is a sapphire vapor x2 ATX and AMD
- ATX but it's bad this is an ice q I'm
sorry this is an H is a cqx - Radeon HD
7870 that is also bad this is a ZOTAC
gtx 550 ti this is functional but it's
older and it's not as useful anymore
this is the last thing that I love
should still be functional this is the
last thing that I bought the GTX 970 at
nuoc with my new AG employee discount
which is was that 10% and actually I
never got sampled any GTX 970 s so this
is my only gtx 970 and it's still
functional and i keep it up here in case
i need gtx 970 on hand if i need to test
something that requires 3.5 gigs of iran
for example haha so yeah there's those
otech already showed you that and then
finally an old-school original RX 4 80
so this this is actually probably worth
something but it's it's an engineering
sample sent to me directly from AMD and
i have a very strict rule about not
selling or otherwise disposing of
engineering samples i keep them forever
for myself because you're not supposed
to do that and finally right up there in
the corner is the rest of the AMD stuff
so this is the risin box that they sent
with the rise and launch which is made
of maple this is the only one that i've
kept of the different rise in boxes that
they've sent and actually that inside of
it has a bunch of empty retail boxes for
other cpus that i broke down and smashed
down so i could still have them but they
wouldn't be stacked everywhere
collecting dust also my thread ripper my
to thread Ripper boxes are up there
as well as oh yeah I believe the the AP
use the Raven Ridge AP boxes up there
too so guys that's pretty much gonna
wrap it up for this video I know it's
been a little off-the-cuff but I get
quite a few questions about what all
this stuff I have arrayed in my
background is all of it came from
somewhere and has some meaning so
hopefully now you guys are a little bit
more familiar with that and all of
course continue to add to this as I get
random stuff that I feel like oh I
should keep that for a keepsake or
whatever if you enjoy this video they'll
hit the thumbs up button thank you guys
so much again for watching and don't
forget to subscribe for more tech videos
coming very soon including that's
testing video of the $900 gaming and
streaming PC should be up in just a day
or two thanks again guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
