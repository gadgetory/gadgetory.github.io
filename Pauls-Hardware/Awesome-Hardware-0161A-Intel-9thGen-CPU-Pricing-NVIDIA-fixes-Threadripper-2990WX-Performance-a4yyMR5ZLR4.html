because it deserved it
okay where is people are asking where
your gold-plated button is oh did did
they hear us talking I'm not sure I
don't think we were actually
broadcasting on that part that's weird
but we should be broadcasting now so
hello everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware awesome hardware's a live show
we discuss technology so today we have
some some technology topics we're gonna
run down them for you today they're
exciting we've been doing the show for
160 shows now and this is the hundred
and sixty first show and this show is
gonna be just ever so slightly different
than shows we've done in the past I'm
not gonna explain it now you guys can
maybe figure it out
not too different so don't get worried
or anything quick warning at the
beginning of the show we drink some beer
thanks for joining us drink responsibly
also we occasionally use adult language
so hide your wife hide your kids we
might use curse words not excessively or
anything and if you'd like to help
support us then you can shop at our
stores Paul Cybernet is my store my
shirts mugs pint glasses it's all real
nice so if you do bias things when you
will shout out your name much later in
the show we're going to do that in the
after party segment this time and
there's Kyle's store bit wait tech slash
store so so buy some stuff won't ya
it'll help us out yep all that said with
these beautiful glasses Cheers oh yeah
just like these glasses or these shirts
or my shirt it also calls a trader I'm
wearing a horrible gamer's nexus shirt
today it'll treat her just only because
Steve paid me for this advertising spot
let's dive into the news though look at
that look at that we're getting right to
it we're not we're not messing around
here agency so first news segment is
actually from reddit from the Saarland
the hardware subreddit Pamela said this
Hardware I'll bread it I've read it and
this is about a Singaporean retailer
called biz gram and they list a PDF they
send a PDF out to advertise their prices
and stuff you can buy on their store and
they have included ninth generation
Intel pricing on this list you sure this
isn't new egg some new eggs eggs gram
this gram here so you can you can jump
in here
and see that did I show you this that's
the reddit page so it's all linked in
the description by the way if you guys
want to check out the stories themselves
well here's their prices yes it's a bit
of a just big old whirlwind of Yaddo
chart but if you scroll down here and
look over to the right until ninth gen
CPU coming soon is what they have listed
here so we got the 9900 k the 9700 K in
the 9600 K and the 9350 case there's a
four core for thread and all the prices
are listed here and the kind of person
over on reddit did some calculation
because this is a Singapore and
Singaporean retailer who is listing
Singaporean dollars I don't know what
their actual currency is called there
but they use a dollar sign from from
what I can tell but they did the
currency conversion as well as removing
the tax that would be automatically
included in the price and converted that
to get us some may be potential prices
now of course grain of salt these are
there's only rumored products not sure
if this is true or not but 452 dollars
is the price they come up with for the
9900 K just the flagship 8 core 16
thread processor which is rumored to
ship with a 5 gigahertz clock speed the
8 core 8 thread 9700 k $352 which sounds
reasonable for an intel 8 core yeah
3,350 bucks i mean if if that's gonna
get you most of the gaming or pretty
much all the gaming performance of the
9900 k then 350 bucks for the processor
that you would want for the best gaming
performance which i mean based on
historical performance of intel
processors is what I'm assuming might be
the case here yeah so yeah and then for
the 9600 K 6 cores and 6 threads $251
which again it's not horrible yeah since
they've upped their core and thread
counts yeah that's gen I mean he's an
you stuff this sort of get your head
around me like it's an i7 but it doesn't
have hyper threading right with the 9700
K
everything but yeah again assuming these
prices are so much I mean a big based on
the fact that these prices are somewhat
reasonable compared to what we currently
have and they would seem somewhat
competitive of course we don't know
anything about performance or anything
yet I guess that seems okay I mean it
could always be cheaper it could always
be cheaper right 352 for the for the i7
9700 k that's about 30 bucks more than
what the 2700 X is going for right now
they have the same core count now
granted you get 16 cores and yet SMT
with the AMD and threads 16 thread sorry
which which you're not getting hyper
threading here as you mentioned with the
9700 K but these until chips tend to
have slightly higher IPC than their AMD
counterparts so yeah there's kind of a
trade-off there and I think the price
you know if the performance is there
pretty fair and they're still selling
their current gen 8000 series CPUs I
mean they can't keep them in stock they
might potentially have some some
manufacturing delays going on with those
but don't want to get too much off topic
but if you're excited about the new
Intel processors maybe you are maybe
even wait waiting to upgrade for quite a
while that should maybe give you again
grain of salt but that maybe gives you a
little bit better idea of what the
prices will be when they actually come
out
next up though NVIDIA has fixed
performance for the thread Ripper 2990
WX I repeat that Nvidia through their
driver has made some pretty impressive
performance updates oh geez what's going
on in chat I don't know that kinds about
to be banned from he's gone but any most
quick self good Jim Nvidia through their
performance through through a driver
update has basically given some big
performance jumps with gaming on there
twenty nine ninety WX which is a 32 core
sixty-four thread processor that
launched back in August and fizzled out
it feels like an excitement about it
fizzled out pretty quickly and I think
part of the reason for that was that a
lot of the gaming performance that was
shown for it was actually pretty bad
like a lot worse than with a 1950 X or a
2950 X for example and certainly a lot
less than you would get with a lot of
the mainstream Intel processors right
now so it made it a much harder sell for
like oh this is a you can buy this as a
multi-purpose processor and if you
actually have some software that will
use that many cores and threads then you
can still also use it for gaming but if
the gaming sucks on it then selling that
as a multi-purpose system is yourself
but this update has apparently fixed a
bug and there's of course discussion in
the comments about whether or not like
this was somehow the timing of this with
Nvidia and the performance on AMD and
everything but all that aside this new
driver update is 3:9 9.2 4 it was just
released today and apart from some
updated support for new games like
shadow Tomb Raider call of duty blobs 4
and black call of duty black ops for
black out beta and a set of course a
competition me all of those have a
pretty good pronunciation okay I can
tell also this bugs bug fix addressing
the differences between the two
processors so here on the PC perspective
charts and again article linked in the
description if you want to check it out
we can see the 2990 WX originally tested
in gaming mode and then the 2950 X which
is the 16 core the updated 16 core
variants so here you can see updated
driver and then they also tested the
2990 WX in one quarter mode which
basically gave you it's basically
accusing a single eight core there's one
cc X right yeah uses one not one cc X or
not one of the risin course so you get
eight cores instead of 32 right but you
get much more similar performance so
here we can see from the just 2990 WX
with 40 5.2 fps and Grand Theft Auto 5
now jumped up to 70 3.2 which granted is
still a pretty decent way short of the
88.2 frames per seconds that you might
get with the 29 50 X or like you know an
8700 K which is giving you
118 frames per second this is testing
with the 1080 TI by the way it's it's an
improvement so and they go down multiple
games like that so um used to be 50%
less performance with GTA 5 now it's
more like 20% less performance so better
but not ideal Assassin's Creed origins
went from about 43% behind to about 13%
behind till the war where I'm r2 was one
of the worst performers just handled the
threat core and thread-count of the 2990
FX absolutely horrendous horrendously
you can see the these low numbers here
it improved it like ever so slightly
from 13 to 18 point 4 but still just
abysmal so obviously this hasn't fixed
every single game f1 2017
also jumps to 78% so big old jump there
to within 7% so from 79 FPS to 141
Middle Earth shadow of war jumped from
87 to 113 so now it's pretty much on
poor on par with what you would get with
a 1950 X for example Far Cry 5 wouldn't
even run with this 32 a core processor
before but how it does it still sucks
but at least runs it went from will not
run into 49 frames per second which is
still like half the performance to get
otherwise but I'm just understand when
you're starting from zero anything is an
improvement there's got to be a meme for
this like 2990 WX will it one will it
run cry 5 it's so disappointing when
ethos like this processor should be the
most epic consumer processor you can
possibly buy yeah 32 cores and
everything and then it's like and it
plays games it's way way worse than a
200-dollar processor but yeah this is a
step in the right direction hopefully
we're gonna see more stuff like software
updates to handle even for the price
even with these fixes for the price that
you're paying for that chip like if
you're gonna do any amount of gaming or
just a decent amount of gaming and
workstation stuff I would just go for
the 29 50 X to be fair AMD repeated many
many times this is not intended to be a
gaming product of course
you buy for gaming yeah but it does hurt
the people who are like I really could
make use of all those cores but I want a
gaming system - exactly I guess then you
have to build two computers or something
if you really want that but right maybe
we'll see further updates and it's also
good it's also gonna sting a little bit
that their competitor fixed their issue
yeah that's gotta sting a little bit
from just uh it was like in video
sabotage you know yeah I won't speculate
either way it's not great let us let us
proceed Seagate has a 14 terabyte hard
drive and this is not like a enterprise
hard drive that only enterprise people
can use the cost way more money than you
do I spend this is actually a hard drive
that maybe you guys at home might what
if you can stomach the launch price of
580 dollars a problem which is a lot for
storage but again 14 terabytes is what
you get with the Barracuda Pro here
that's actually pretty good
yeah price per gig is 4.1 4 cents per
gigabyte yeah
compare that to SSD prices these days
which are very good have come down a lot
but are still at about 20 20 cents per
gigabyte so that's still maintaining
some relevance for these big high
terabyte counts I was actually expecting
this drive when I was hearing all the
news about initially to be a lot more
expensive yeah well it's pretty damaged
so yeah and endow Seagate there's some
some cool specs going on with it too
it's got a multi segmented DRAM cache of
256 megabytes that sure as I'm sure the
article explains more about why that's
good it's got eight platters 1077
gigabits per square inch of areal
density on the on those eight platters
it's a helium-filled enclosure and the
main difference compared to the 12 tired
by a terabyte version of this drive
which launched in the fourth quarter of
2017 last year is the use of
two-dimensional magnetic recording heads
and again if you're really interested go
to the last page of the article and
there's an actual diagram of it if you
guys want a little bit more information
on that
if you're really into mechanical heart
spinning hard drive technology I'm I'm
vaguely fascinated but I couldn't tell
you off the top of my head the
difference there typically only draws
about 6.9 Watson oh so very power
efficient and this is one of my favorite
features it's meant for 24/7 usage
that's awesome so 300 terabytes per year
workload reading and a five year
warranty 24/7 you should usage though
rating from the manufacturer means it
could drop into mass units yeah which it
the circular solution which might be run
in your drives lot and so yeah yeah and
then the cool thing about you know the
3.5 inch drives it's more terabytes in
them as you can have a smaller enclosure
with fewer drives that uses less power
overall but still have lots of storage
so now you're for drive 14 terabyte
array is gonna have wait what is that 40
plus 16 it's gonna have 56 terabytes
mmm-hmm 56 terabytes of storage on four
drives which it's pretty epic and of
course you know you could have more than
four drives too so you can do the math
for those they're targeting creative
professionals with high performance
desktops home service and/or
direct-attached storage units so there
you go
if you were interested I'm gonna swap
out all my all my 8 terabyte Toshiba
drives for ya in the in the disk shelf
but 20 bay disk shelf CK therefore these
CK if you're watching I will do that too
the article also includes some
performance testing I'm not gonna go
into that because it's pretty much the
same as all the other 3 point 5
terabytes 3.5 inch mechanical 7200 RPM
hard drives out there alright Samsung
and SK Hynix who are the first and third
biggest semiconductor companies
manufacturing companies in the world
with fabs according to digit times and
this article is actually from PC games
and are slimming down their expansion
plans for DRAM and NAND chip production
in the coming months
which is kind of lame which which kind
of sucks this is not necessarily the
biggest news again original articles on
digitized but depending on what browser
you look at it with digit times might
tell you that you should log in or not
so that's why we're looking at this
article over here but the G Times is
very reputable so this is this is well
sourced they're citing a global
oversupply which has got a stay slump in
demand and low prices Laureus ly low
prices if you're looking and shopping
for SSDs right now gosh you can get 240
gig solid SSDs for 40 to 50 bucks you
can get 480 gig 512 kick drives for like
80 to 100 bucks like nice ones we can
get a really fast nvme MDOT 2 500 gig
drive for like a samsung 960 Evo for 150
bucks so they like reasonable drives
they're not just like oh that like
bottom of them crazy high-end perform
like money you'd spend on a drive that's
is gonna get you much performance like
it's actually a reasonable choice to
slot into a computer so that's really
cool for all of us and consumers of
course these people who actually
manufacture the NAND flash chips and
everything like wait we're not making
nearly as much money as we were like a
year ago when all the prices were
overinflated which caused Chinese the
Chinese government to initiate a
price-fixing lawsuit with my micron
Samsung and SK Hynix that's still
ongoing by the way for price fixing
between 2016 and 2017 but now they're
both talking publicly about just like
cutting back the plans that they were
that they had because they they were
public with some of these plans for what
they were gonna do in order to combat
the especially on the DRAM side because
the ramp side the prices still haven't
come down they're still pretty bad but
even with that they're like no we're
gonna like we're gonna cut back on this
stuff on the manufacturing plans we had
we're gonna manufacture less so that
demands many supply demand price goes up
they make more money so that's kind of
that kind of sucks I mean this is this
is not good news this is maybe something
you should keep in mind if you have been
watching like SSD prices go up and down
I certainly like I bought an a 1
terabyte SSD like two years ago
I feel like it was about two years ago
for the prices that they are right now
and like six months later I was like wow
I'm glad I bought that SSD when I did
because you know there was a sale was it
was a one terabyte sandwich it was a one
terabyte SanDisk for like a hundred and
seven hundred and sixty or hundred and
seventy bucks good so still even by
today's standards but still still pretty
good price and they had dropped that low
two years ago so if in your head the
progress of technology everything should
get cheaper over time but you know
there's also these economies of scale
and right supplying of the actual chips
but cutting back on their production
will cause prices to go up
they're blaming this on lackadaisical
notebook and smartphone sales so if you
guys had bought Moore's notebooks and
smart phones they wouldn't have to go
and cut back their production and like
not bringing their fabs online Samsung
had promised there to bring the new fabs
that they're working on online sometime
in the first half of 2019 no they had
promised it late 2018 but now they're
not going to bring them online until the
first half of 2019 also the article says
that they're putting a stop to plans to
enhance the RAM fabs in Hawaii song and
young young tech young tech it's at the
name of a city yes this is this is o
Korea when you said I was thinking te CH
I was like there's a city county um
Chang know young tech sounds reasonable
Kim tech yep uh yeah so if there's
Samsung Femmes were also originally
intended to produce 30 thousand extra
DRAM wafers in the third quarter of 2018
but now they're just like we're not
going to do that because you didn't buy
enough bones or no flakes I don't know
it's your fault it seems like strange
activity to be doing while you're have
an ongoing a lawsuit with the Chinese
government for price fixing but I guess
you guys do you if there is any good
news
sensible in this story it is that micron
that numbers the second of those top
three NAND and flash manufacturers
doesn't seem to be there at least hasn't
publicly stated that they're taking this
route and China has been well China's
been working to do more homegrown
technology manufacturing themselves for
quite some time which includes
DRAM fabs so we might expect some
Chinese based fabs to come online and
ramp up production soon and that might
provide more competition so love to see
how that goes
and microns not part of the velocity
right yes they are oh they are yeah
all three are part of the lottery my
current micron Samsung and SK Hynix re
micron seems they're the only one that's
somewhat scared of the Chinese
government matter they just haven't come
out publicly and been like yeah we're
gonna gonna ramp back and play
production ACK yeah what you guys want
more DRAM suck it all right let's move
on to Stegman number 2 which is a very
straightforward title this is yes no it
sounds complicated and there is a
strawpoll it's not linked in the video
description I don't think but I will
post it in chat right now and I'll
hopefully Jawa I'll hopefully update the
video description at some point to there
are four different things for you to
vote yes or no on on the straw poll so
I'm sending it out early but that is
purely for efficiency reasons you should
wait you should wait until we go over
these things but multiple votes on that
strap hole so go ahead and do your thing
but we're gonna we're gonna talk yes or
no on the headphone jack the www being
killed off by chrome blue boxes and the
Facebook AI so starting off with the
headphone jack and this is an article
from PC world by Gordon Mong and I liked
it so everyone go read it but Apple of
course started by killing the headphone
jack and we've seen that repeated by
many different cell phone manufacturers
Kyle
exhibit a your pixel two has no
headphones two is neutered
the neutered of a headphone jack now you
can get around this lack of headphone
jack by plugging in a USB C to 3.5
millimeter adapter so you can plug in
you know if you've got some analog
headphones if you don't want to use the
Bluetooth you can plug in the adapter
now Gordon tested a bunch of these
adapters and he discovered a horrifying
truth which is that the DAC the digital
analog converter doesn't exist in the
same place in all different phones so
some phones ship a dongle that has a DAC
built into it and that is the case with
the pixel 2 XL it's got basically just a
USB device with the digital analog
converter in it and then it spits out an
analog signal audio signal on the other
side a lot of these other phones though
the DAC is actually built into the phone
and the converter this type seats analog
converter you get is basically a
glorified adapter so it's using what
would be those digital connections in
there and sending an analogue connection
over it and using the converter to
basically pass that analog signal
through the DAC lives in the phone not
in the Dumble what this means is that if
you try to take one of those adapters
one of those dongles and plug it into a
phone that doesn't have the capability
to pass the analog signal through the
USBC port then it doesn't work so that's
obviously a situation that not a lot of
people are going to run into because
this would have to be like oh my wife
and I both got two different phones and
I want to use her dongle and I found
that my wife's dongle just doesn't work
for me you know it's just just a sad
situation when it comes to that but more
to the point it's sort of a messy
situation when it comes to just the
simple usability of plugging in
headphones so and it brings back the
age-old argument dongle or no dongle or
more I guess more improve on Jack should
it really be gone or is it one of those
things
it's uh you know having it removed it's
gonna be a fad and eventually in the
future people realize you know it it's
just something that should be there and
people should use it now Bluetooth of
course is the other argument and Kyle
has told me before that Bluetooth you
know is the future if you switch to
Bluetooth devices that once you go bt
you never go B stands for back but
Bluetooth could be can also be accused
of limiting your audio quality my
following ways around this get over it
but if you're used to listening to very
high quality audio from the very high
quality sources with high quality decks
and headphones and Kalla went what have
funds to usually use your day today's
here yeah biodynamic dat pros a pretty
nice aren't they not they're their
entry-level audiophile grade if they're
still still pretty nice 250 bucks you're
not in anything fancy but they're
they're they're slightly above the
mainstream so if you're using bluetooth
though than the blue the sound quality
of the Bluetooth is also going to be
heavily dependent on the decks that are
in the Bluetooth headphones that you're
using and those are not always gonna be
the same so in a lot of ways it gets you
get what you pay for but that's sort of
the premise we're not going to say yes
or no right now we're gonna go down
these rapid fire with no and we'll give
we'll give our opinions on these let's
move on to the next one though which is
Google with the most recent version of
chrome and chromium which is version 69
AO has fancy things like a revamped UI
it's got a new password manager and
they've removed what they're calling
trivial subdomains trivial trivial
subdomains from the URL bar this
articles from phosphites calm and so
that trivial subdomains according to the
chrome developers is the www at the
beginning of a website URL or perhaps
the M that might indicate a mobile
specific URL
and this article goes over that and why
it may or may not be a good thing
there's a chromium blog thread that's
linked here with many people strongly
criticizing Google over this move for a
lot of people it's like for some people
seems more of a principled stance
they're saying like the chrome
developers just decided this was the
right way to do it so they just
implemented it that way and sort of it
was sort of this mentality that you know
we think that's what's best so we're
just gonna do that and everyone's just
going to sort of adapt to it like they
own the internet or something now if you
don't like it of course Firefox does not
do this and there are other options when
it comes to your internet browsing
software that you choose to use hold on
do we know why they thought it was an
issue in the first place to have the WWE
it's not clearly described to me by
reading the articles I'm sure maybe they
have put it more eloquently or something
but I don't see it's one of those
simplification things and like
everything should be simpler and more
easily easy to look at and the complex
formatting of a typical website URL with
the HTTP and like what does that mean at
hyper hypertext like I'm not even
excited right now
and like the WW whatever else is going
on there it's the same thing with like
Windows removing filename extensions
like dot exe and dot that's useful
though yeah that's useful shit well
that's super useful to be able to see
them and know what kind of file you're
looking at they were they were like no
that's gonna confuse people who don't
know what a dot exe is stupid so we're
just gonna hide it so you can't see what
it is but comparatively I've never found
the WW in my url bar to be particularly
useful like oh thank god that www is
there everything's working and a lot of
times if you just type in a website
versus typing WWF site it's good it's
the same thing but that's not always the
case and as many people stated in that
chromium blog thread there's lots of
instances where two sites with similar
your URL schemes can cause confusion it
can also open the open the door to
phishing attacks because if you don't
have a situation where the WW is going
to resolve to the site that doesn't have
the www
you might have somebody who can create a
phishing email or something like that
that has a website that looks like where
it should go but it actually doesn't so
again something that people are debating
and discussing whether or not it was a
good thing that Google did or the chrome
team I guess specifically did or not and
will will will say whether or not it's a
good thing in just a second let's move
on
Brussels rustles you were in Brussels
recently no I was no no sorry not
Brussels you're near Brussels Bruges
you're in Bruges freaking Bruges hello
waffles you were in you were in Belgium
though right yes nothing that's in
Belgium yep okay so VA has Luke boxes
and loot boxes we all love of course but
Belgium has recently passed some laws
about online gambling and anti gambling
online and they determined that loot
boxes are gambling and therefore if your
game has loot boxes you you shouldn't
you have to do something to get rid of
that if you want to have your game be
available in Belgium yay was like screw
you we don't care what you have to say
we're gonna do that anyway and we're not
gonna change anything
they're keeping these card packs
essentially is what they call them the
loot boxes in FIFA 18 as well as FIFA 19
which is coming out soon end of
September that's when FIFA 19 comes out
I don't play the FIFA game so but but
people who do they're very very into it
it probably also means you're very into
soccer and that you're very mad that I
just called football soccer how dare you
but offended in Brussels public
prosecutor's office has announced its
consent its conducting a criminal
investigation into EA for failure to
comply this is gonna be there's gonna be
like a belgium belgian attack team like
squad that like flies in with belgian
belgium helicopters belgian belgium go
down to rest all the EA people carrying
out all the loot boxes I think that's
that's what I'm seeing it's happening we
don't know what's gonna happen here it's
an interesting you know the the
government decide
that they this is illegal versus the
company deciding now we're just gonna do
that anyway we'll see how that goes
everyone in chat and sing football it's
fine football this is really important
about this art we have the football
American in between football and soccer
yeah what we're saying so Luke box it's
more more to the Pope I mean the
question we're asking here more is Luke
boxes should loot boxes be a thing or
not I don't get it so in this game our
loot box is something that people can
buy with real money or almost always in
these cases it's like oh you can play
the game for X amount of time and then
you can earn these or you can just or
you can just spend money right now and
get a pack of them for you know however
much money and I'm guessing they're
really rarely what people can then sell
for real money as well uncertainty that
is not sure bet and that that is
actually a pretty key point of
distinction in the argument as to
whether or not these are gambling cuz I
think you couldn't you can make a strong
art you can make a strong point that
it's not gambling if that is not part of
it mm-hmm
if the money going if the money being
paid is a one-way thing right then yes
but if those can then be resold like
like you know the csgo skin yeah like
that right then it brings the there's a
money-making element yeah yeah and right
sort of a scaling up of cost and
everything's right there well Marcie one
last thing to discuss here on yes no
Facebook is making an AI that can
identify offensive memes wait what
Facebook is making AI make them yeah I
know they can identify offensive memes
as demonstrated here with this picture
of penguins great England's it says
penguins can fly just gonna look at the
meme and then figure out whether it's
offensive or not
well is it is alright is the AIA going
to use 2018 Offensive standards or like
2000 off it would be offensive would be
a learning computer it would it would
develop over time because every meme is
offensive in 2018 because everyone is so
easily triggered like there will be zero
memes
once this a I fully evolves well and I
think
like the the key words that stand up
here for me our Facebook and AI and the
base is developing its own intelligence
now like I think Facebook is is
dangerous enough as it is
without an AI and AI as we all know is
well has a natural progression towards
gaining sentience and then deciding
humans are evil and then turning against
this and working towards our ultimate
extinctions so that's why obviously I
mean I'm probably skewing the results of
the yes/no here a little bit but just a
damn no I mean that's that's what comes
to my mind when when I read this article
and I look at that meme of penguins can
fly also surprise they would use such an
offensive meme just as a demonstration I
know clearly what are the Penguins gonna
think they're probably gonna go they're
probably pissed make even more offensive
memes probably holding a bunch of
torches right now marching towards the
Facebook Hsu and you know they're
probably getting really hot because
they're not used to torches all right
well thanks to all you guys who have
provided us feedback and voted we are
going to run down our yes or no so Kyle
what that phone jack yes or no no Cal
says no I don't need it www need it yes
or no no no ww-wait
I should phrase that differently should
it be killed off should it be killed off
yes or no no it should not be killed off
oh oh gosh well now that it's already
killed off I don't care if they bring it
back or not
so saying yes kill otter kill off the
WWE it's already done okay too much work
to go backwards I'm tracking you oh no I
never clicked shoot
I said what I never clicked in the thing
when I made this this I never click the
multi votes thing everyone has only
gotten one vote on this I'm sorry it's
okay though that's all still for what
they were most true what what you struck
them deepest but let's just say Lou
boxes yes or no I don't say no actually
it's only gonna be the first one because
if they did it in order
well I don't know I don't think I can
edit cuz I didn't create this one it's a
pretty basic alright so anyway all right
so loot boxes I'm gonna say sure gotta
like flute box yeah fuck it
alright facebook' I uh yeah you know
it's time for a shake alright time for a
humankind shake up I vote power
I vote opposite of everything Kyle voted
for everyone jad phone jack at big time
also everyone voted on this before
realizing ok I know though pretty much
is considering it wow you're all week
one of the last bitches the most
controversial here is obviously killing
off the WW which is only a few votes
away alright so this this is the first
time I've done yes/no in this format and
in the future I think I can improve
things but I think we've all learned
something today
I think we've all learned something how
do you start important alright sure guys
we said things are going to be a little
bit different for this episode of
awesome hardware and that is all for my
half of the show that's correct if you
want the long-form version stick around
to the very end when we do the after
party that'll be exciting
for now though we're going to switch
over to outside of the show which will
be on Kyle's channel which is called bit
wits and it's linked to the video's
description thanks for watching this one
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
