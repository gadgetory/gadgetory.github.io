know what to say what to do how about
about hello it's a good idea
hello scum that's a good way to start
things off to kick things off the
beginning saying that for years
works every time alright I think we're
about live now yeah
hello everyone and welcome this is
awesome hardware every Tuesday evening
at about 5:30 p.m. Pacific time Kyle and
I stream a live show we talk about
technology and it goes for a couple
hours typically we've actually been
already streaming the first half of
today's show which is episode number 134
oh my god - Kyle's channel bit wit so if
you missed that the link to that is down
in this video's description you're now
watching 1:30 for site B this means that
we've already been talking for stuff
about stuff and we've already been
having a few drinks so if you enjoy a
beer if you're old enough and you want
to drink responsibly thanks for being
here and reading it in with us if not
hey that's cool to bear in mind
occasionally we do use adult language on
this show so hide your kids and
everything and this is the last episode
of 2017 you're right it is this is being
next week's episode before Christmas
this is December 19th right now next
week Tuesday is gonna be the day after
Christmas we're gonna take that later
yeah but we will be back on Tuesday
after New Year's too just to basically
explain to you guys what the deal is
with 2018 yeah oh you guys wondering all
of our deep garden what's gonna happen
in 2018 will will tell you guys all
what's going on yes the meantime though
Cheers
thanks for joining us everyone I
actually have to pound the rest of this
because for my punishment for this for
the first half i humiliated kyle in a
epic um flash game battle in the first
half of the show therefore he is
drinking all that beer yes
can i go ahead and turn Kyle's
compressor up a little post
oh good good go beautiful if you guys
want to help support our channels if you
like what we do you like watching our
videos and stuff and you want to get
yourself some nice merchandise at the
same time check out our stores pulsar
bird that net is my story we have
recently added these full-color printed
15 ounce mugs including the zero
insertion force logo as well as a few
other options in there as well as a
couple sets
pardon me so check those out if you want
to have also just recently added quite a
few awesome hardware brand like awesome
heart where the show stuff if you might
have some hardware stuff from either of
our stores the proceeds get split
between us so don't worry about whose
store you order from we both get money
either way so don't worry about that
also big shout out to Brian he's our
friend who's too designed a lot of this
stuff like the the just recently added
Star Wars shirt I love it which is
really cool it's got an orion hero on
there which which is awesome anyway so
check that stuff out I also got keycaps
also got bottle openers on my store
Kyle store is bit with tech slash store
he also has a wide variety of stuff both
of our stores have us some deals going
on if you spend more than 50 bucks or
more than 100 bucks you get 10% or 20%
off mm-hmm so buy some stuff and hope
you guys like it most of the feedback we
get is very very very positive yeah it's
all really high quality stuff yeah
we only sell stuffs that we would use
ourselves and indeed we do this is true
to prove that right now by drinking some
water out of my zero insertion force
month I should have brought one of my
mouse pad see damn it I just don't have
this crisis three mouse pad pads and
it's like you know they have a mouse pad
right here but like literally everything
is on it I don't want to pick it up
there's that one back here yes yeah
there you go for that look at that
but but does it run crisis way better
than stupid crisis nothing beats the
crisis mousepad okay this is classic
this is my life
I have kept that for many many many many
years now alright let's talk about some
tech news
yay and let's start with something that
we brought up in discuss kind of briefly
last week but this week there's a little
bit more a little bit more that's kind
of trickled out about it this is all
rumors and speculation about what's
coming up for AMD in 2018 Verizon -
specifically and here we have an article
from tech report now this is derived
from an article on Moe PC which is a
Chinese website and they are citing and
digit Times report which is claiming
AMD's rise in two processors which are
codenamed pinnacle ridge will show up in
the first quarter of 2018 there are no
pictures in this article it makes me sad
no sorry picture text is they're talking
about it also separately on that there
is and as yet unheard of and II
fenghuang APU bang bang bang whoa bang
bang yes that's appeared in the size of
Sandra database so a couple different
reports of difference next generation
and the parts the rise and two CPUs are
supposed to be based on AMD Zen +
architecture manufactured on Global
Foundries
12 LP or leading performance process I
believe that is also 12 nanometer hmm
although article doesn't seem too
specific specifically say it's a 12-man
Amir if that's what we're saying so in
case you're a little bit confused about
this this derivation here Zen is the
code name for the CPU micro micro
architecture that rise in all the rise
and current rise in CPUs are based on
there is
a Zen - that's been talked about which
is gonna be the the next like a new
architecture like the second generation
of Zen architecture that's not what
that's being used here what supports
being use your Zen plus so it's almost
akin to like the Intel tick-tock thing
it seems like a little bit
Zen plus is like Zen original on 14
nanometer but shrink down to 12
nanometer and there might be some
refinements there going on as well so
but it's not best not to confuse Rising
2 with Zen - yes
so Rising 2 is based on Zen plus Zen -
might be further out in the future and
maybe raisin 3 will be based on that or
something who knows we're not sure how
they're gonna okay actually name that
stuff but yeah again if these rumors are
true then this will be based on that
GlobalFoundries 12 LP leading
performance process I don't know why
they have to call it that but yeah the
improved process could let pinnacle
Ridge units clock higher or potential
potentially overclock better it might
also support higher ddr freak dr4
frequencies and that has been a bit of a
sticking point when existing rise and
you have to it's finicky with what right
with what ddr4 you pair it with right
but it also benefits a lot from being
able to run a higher frequency memory so
yeah that's why a lot of us have
recommended and making sure you get
higher frequency memory that's also
validated to work with your processor
and motherboard date at that point the
real bottleneck is your wallet yes with
with ddr4 prayer for crisis it kind of
sucks but hopefully those are gonna come
down in 2018 rumors based on that -
which hopefully actually yeah
the existing rise in three rise in five
and resin seven series names will be
kept but it'll be a 2 mm instead of 1000
series so your 1,800 X was rising - will
be a 2800 X your 16 your risin 5 1,600
will be a risin 5 2600 which if you're
familiar with the existing breakdown of
verizon processors is fairly simple to
take from
point A to point B I'm not sure if
that's gonna also be the equivalent
amount of cores and threads and
everything I kind of hope it is to some
degree maybe the same rough breakdown
cores and threads wise because I feel
like they have a pretty good spread
going from your quad core no hype no no
sometimes reading all the way up to the
tier 8 core with it yeah
with multi-threading but yeah we'll see
how it actually pans out when hopefully
come come January these will fit in
existing am4 sockets so an existing aim
for motherboards should support this
rise into these rise and 2 CPUs as long
as you get a BIOS update that will
almost guaranteed be required however
there are also reports of as media
working on X 470 and B 450 chipsets to
go with new motherboards to pair up with
these CPUs and that's slated for
potentially March 2018 again all this
stuff is rumors yeah and that's what
kind of what we've seen from Intel in
the past to heaven it's the same socket
they would but a different chipset that
has it would be interesting to me
depending on when the CPUs actually go
up for sale whether it's like January
February it would be weird kind of weird
to see the CPUs go for the next gen
before next gen motherboards go for sale
but hopefully AMD will tell everyone
what the differences with the
motherboards so that anyone who might
have access to the CPUs earlier on you
can make a better more informed decision
on whether they want to wait for you
know to upgrade along with the new
motherboard or whether they'd be you
know they'd have the same level of
performance that they want with
something like an X 370 right or B 350
all right cool there's also links and
all my all my articles by the way guys
are like the video description there's
also a WCC F Tech article link down
there that's actually from last week and
we went over this a little bit last week
this is when some of these rumors first
started to come out there's a little bit
more information in there too so check
it out if you want to let's move on
though to an article from the
and this is a follow-up to what we
discussed last week about patreon and we
did it
patreon has changed their minds Wow
congratulations Kyle thanks mostly in
part to us all me to us talking about
this last week patreon has decided to
scrap their plans to add a bunch of
service fees and charges to their
configuration of how people donate to
patient's and whether they get their all
of their donations rolled up in bulk or
whether the charge individually in
charge fees on each one each one
individually in particular this as
discussed last week this hurt people who
are making small donations like your
smaller one and $2 Day donations to a
patron but those are often very
important to patrons because getting
lots of small donations is often a lot
more sustainable than relying on a few
whales or large patrons who might donate
a lot of money for a little bit but yeah
it's difficult to sustain that so yeah
patreon basically based on the backlash
has said we're going to press pause CEO
Jack Conte til told The Verge so yeah
we're taking full credit for this so
Louis
article lists many different apologies
changing the world retractions they were
apologizing to different patreon users
who had lost patrons due to this news
because there's a lot of people are just
like I'm pulling out like whatever I
gotta find some of the platform to
support my my creators on or whatever
but yeah the payment system just to be
clear is still going to change patreon
is still planning to change their
payment system so they said right now
it's too confusing and difficult to
scale right now wait so what what are
they changing their payment system to
that's not been determined so all
they've said is this plan that we
decided we could maybe push through we
have determined cause too much negative
back
and too much too many people to start
being like I'm not doing this anymore
whatever their alternatives be yes so
they're gonna try to do it a different
way okay cuz uh you know on some level
if you if you try to look at both sides
of this patreon is a business and
they're trying to you know increase
partner they're trying to optimize to
some degree yeah and there might be some
way that they can do it that that's a
balance between not screwing over people
who were who are the patrons who were
here you know heard you were donating
and you know still making patreon a
decent amount of money to run their
business and minimizing the amount of
fees that they have to pay as they do
transactions and everything like that
because that's I think that's really
what it boils down to is a number of
transactions going through the fees that
are that they have to pay yeah to the
financial institutions that are handling
those transactions right and then trying
to sort of figure out the the most
optimal way of doing it but what they
figured out last week was obviously a
very bad idea and thanks to all the
people who spoke out about it because I
like the concept of patreon and I like
yeah that you know earnest and creators
are able to go on there and make a
living in a way that you know they might
not have been able to twenty years ago
when it didn't exist so yeah that's kind
of cool but you don't know you don't
want to see something like that get
popular enough to the point where they
feel like they're the big fish and they
can do whatever they want and it doesn't
matter because you know they have the
the most of the market is going with
them so they can just sort of call their
own shots right then an ISP in it yeah
exactly is peeing in our cereal no one
should be very requesting on my cereal
what what's your request
you should go grab another bean I love
your requests sometimes and in the
meantime I thought well Kyle does that
either grab two smaller ones or one
larger one oh that's my suggestion let's
talk about Corsair and ekw be
this is articles from tech power up and
about a month ago we did also discuss
this on the live show tech power broke
the news it's ek water blocks was
parting ways with several of their top
brass including their CEO CTO and head
of marketing as well as some others in
the company and since then there was
speculation as to what happened what
caused that oh hey there you go
actually that's a good choice that's a
very good stream before Christmas yeah
so what happened what caused that's
Wilkin we'll get back to that in just a
moment but a brief pause for to show you
guys delirium
Noel so delirium tremens is a type of
beer a Belgian beer that we we quite
enjoy yes this was available at BevMo
it's called delirium Noel and I don't I
don't know what deal is with it it's a
Belgian Tripel that's probably you know
obviously more seasonal okay probably
has some you know roots has its roots
baked into the delirium tremens but
people are getting ready to clip this
I'm gonna make an attempt to not only
uncork the bottle but also keep it from
spilling all over the table and keeping
the cork away from my eye we're already
on the second keyboard here we go
alright here we go
oh god it's beautiful
oh my god he's learning Zen kale he's
learning I didn't I didn't say I was
gonna make it perfect par right hey
freakin all the way back to your fairy
tale here is in the glass and I call
that a sixer fect porch you're getting a
perfect thank Thank You Kyle for your
abating the libations you're getting a
good pour look at that Paul it is its
glory a little bit ahead there there you
go pal
excellent I guess that's fishing
oh yeah oh yeah okay what are we on now
Cheers I want to place this cheers
Cheers excuse to all of you know for
sticking with us
mainly because you're hoping that will
fail miserably like we usually do but
even we don't appreciate it that's
flavorful there's a lot of depth it's a
lot to unpack there I know I don't feel
like I'm so good I need any time any
more time hmm all right
most valuable Curt's back to the story
so there was a speculation about ek and
like is the company falling apart is
just is this just sort of a mutual
separation of the executives who have
differing opinions on how the company
should proceed since then ek has
actually come to market with several
products that they had already promised
including additions to the fluid gaming
lineup as well as a new modular yeah
all-in-one MLC series that they came out
with but the two executives who are
moving to Corsair are mark tanco who is
the CEO and Nico to Bedard
I am sorry Nico Nico bit louder panting
Kubelik Nico to better like this he's
the XE x CTO we go to titty bar
yeah the cousin yeah come on you circle
my shaft oh well you go play the pool
that's exactly this word-for-word quote
grand theft anything anyway though mark
go mark is now the vice president and
business unit general manager at Corsair
Nico is now the director of engineering
at Corsair now you might if you if
you're familiar with corporate titles
mark is the vice president and business
unit general manager now usually when
you're a general manager of a business
unit there would be some specification
as to what that business unit actually
is but that's not being disclosed right
now because of course there's being all
kind of like you know they're playing
their their cards close to their chest
their boobs and something about boobies
boobies point is though it doesn't seem
like it's too much of a stretch to
assume that the business unit being
talked about might be a new custom
water-cooling business unit at course
there specifically to sell custom
articling parts which they don't really
do right now they sell lots of
all-in-one units and that kind of thing
they have talked about and teased some
custom watercooler SFC yes yeah but
those were partnered with a different
brand aqua computer not ek hmm ek does
have a very good reputation in the
custom articling space so it would seem
like this potentially puts Corsair in a
pretty good spot to come out with some
sweets custom articling parts in the
future they're the number one AIO
manufacturer IMO just based on
popularity of course they're I think
like if you think if like like someone
says I have an area in my system guess
what brand it is and you have you had to
guess based on statistics and what you
just know about the industry you I don't
know I would i would guess corsair just
because it we're talking globally just
well I'm sorry mentally the us
protecting us then maybe bubbly is
different story because I'm not sure
coming alongside all I'm saying is I'm
not sure I would say I would think like
yeah that would make some
to me but I just don't know
statistically and I don't and I I'd like
to see a report that has some you know
write some statistics backing it up or
something like that
and if you go global are the report Paul
if you go globe Arthur up then you
include China and China I feel like has
this whole market that like we've never
heard of just you know it doesn't get
discussed on this side of the globe as
much and you don't realize like oh wow
there's like three million people yeah
that that more than that what do we what
we have no there's like in LA or in
there's like 500 million use it yeah we
have we're about 300 million in radio s
China's a lot more than that
oh yeah I mean you go to like Computex
right and you're like oh my god the
g.skill booth is is completely raging oh
yeah and then across from the g.skill
booth there's some other brand you've
never heard of five times the number of
go-go dancers and ten times the loudness
of music that's blaring at other
speakers and they've drawn 50 times the
the crowd that g.skill was able to pull
they who how who is that who are these
people
it's because they're just some random
Chinese company that's taking over the
world we've never heard of them somehow
because we're in our own little North
American Western ice bubble yeah so yeah
on a global scale Corsair is you know
they got some competition
you're still pretty big then they got
some competition they're Chat Chat is
putting out that the Corsair is sold and
Best Buy and they have a deal with them
and that is a good point that does
expand there they reached everything
mortal who wouldn't necessarily be
already dabbling in the true DIY PC
space with people like we often operate
in yeah so that's a good point to fall
in the brick and mortar all right so
let's move on to the next segment which
is crypto currency crypto code we're
going to talk about cryptocurrency
and I want to point out at the back just
breathe
don't worry about it don't worry about I
guess everything's fine alright so
cryptocurrency yep first off I want to
point out that we are not like experts
in cryptocurrency nope what's good
respond a preface preface that next up
why is Quinn desk not even loading up
right now what the heck is going on
bitcoins been a little crazy today so
I'm attempting to load up coin desk and
actually see what the current price of
Bitcoin is is this a we're glad we're
not mining or we are sad because we're
not mining story ah or update if we had
started mining like when we first
started talking about cryptocurrency oh
yeah at any rate days tend to be like oh
my god damn it but be retired right you
know how are you gonna I gotta tell
anything at that this is this is
frustrating I can't pull up I can't pull
up the current price let's look at
Google also the coin desk website seems
very very looks very much like the video
cards calm website I I like the coin
desk website I feel like they do a
pretty good job he just looks like I'm
going to video cards that come alright
well so what's it 17204 yeah courier
this what a bunch of bollocks Bitcoin
17,000 come how long does it take either
of us to mine one Bitcoin that you don't
you don't right now you don't know
unless you have a forum yeah unless you
have a farm with an insane amount of
compute power
well that's disappointing well great
well I'm glad that's not like within
reach so I don't need to think about it
like well maybe I should do that because
it's reasonably done no it's so
impractical right now that it's gonna be
so hard to - you know Bitcoin yeah you
don't mind bitcoins you mind altcoins
you mind other other crypto position
c'mon trade that trade that in for
Bitcoin I don't not know what is going
on with the coin desk website right now
but I was hoping to be able to show you
guys the Bitcoin price and another five
thousand dollars or something no it
actually it actually tanked pretty bad
today it dipped down below seventeen
thousand dollars which it hadn't done in
quite a while it had been dabbling you
know sort of a little bit with the
twenty thousand dollar price range but I
hadn't quite
peaked up above that excuse me but
there's several ongoing issues that
might be affecting its price one of
those is the Bitcoin exchange you bits
which has just recently shut down
actually today and believe this was
today they were hacked a second time is
that why you're gonna shut down they
filed for bankruptcy as a results
because of the hack because of the heck
the hack doesn't lose seventeen percent
of their assets sent a team seventeen
percent yes not not yes
seventeen percent of an asset that was
enough for them to go bankrupt yes
because it's the second time that they
have been hacked okay so yeah geez my
thread already in April you bet formerly
called Yap design lost 4,000 bitcoins
which at today's prices would be worth
about seventy three million dollars they
only lost seventeen percent of their
assets in the cyberattack because they
had a significant amount set in a cold
wallet that wasn't made to be accessed
for transactions to be made upon it so
that's a substantial
exchange that was affected just today
in the meantime Bitcoin fees the actual
fee that you were charged for making a
Bitcoin transaction have significantly
jumped this mean like if you were paying
with something with Bitcoin there's a
fee attached to it yeah if you're
directly making a Bitcoin transaction by
like there's a Bitcoin approved vendors
and stuff
Yesi attached to it yes because any
Bitcoin transactions there's risk
involved has to be integrated into the
blockchain because the block chain is
also the ledger so the way that it has
worked up till now is that the actual
there's there's a size limitation
basically I see and I this was one of
the Articles that I read but I did not
write my notes down for which is why I
don't have the size limitation down
there's a hard-coded 1 megabyte limit on
the size of blocks in the blockchain
there you go
so um typical transaction size is around
500 bytes so the average block has fewer
than 2,000 transactions there's a block
generated once every 10 minutes so that
works out to about 3.3 transactions per
second which is relatively slow when it
comes to the amount of transactions that
might need to be made however there's
also the ability to attach a fee and
when when there's lots of transactions
potentially going on there's more
likelihood that the miner who is
actually mining that particular block
would go for the transactions that have
higher fees attached to them so on
Sunday the average feed was $20 but some
people are gonna pay more in order to
get their transaction a handled sooner
mm-hmm because if you're if you're
offering more for the transaction then
people are gonna pick that up sooner
whereas if you're offering less you
might have to wait longer for a block to
be
in order to get the transaction through
on it I'm not explaining this well
because I've been drinking anyway I got
you I'm with you
on Monday morning as some the estimate
was that you should pay about 16 dollars
and 31 cents to get a transaction into
the next block which would be within
about the next hour or if you wanted it
within the next six blocks I'm sorry
with in 1631 within the next mix block
into the next block wait yeah you should
pay sixteen thirty one to get a
transaction and in the next block while
getting a transaction into one of the
next six blocks within the next hour
cost 1346 so if you're willing to wait a
little bit longer you can bid a little
bit less but overall point is that the
price per transaction is going up and
that makes it more difficult to be a
viable currency to be used for lots of
transactions from people who are using
it on a regular day to day basis so
that's that's just something one of
those other factors when it comes to
cryptocurrency that it's discussion
about what's there in C is that it's
very hackable it's the most hackable of
currency it's all digital you know I
don't know that that is like maybe so
the the hacking that has been going on
is not hacking into Bitcoin or something
like that like write the amount of the
amount of compute power that you would
need for something like that like you'd
need to have the equivalent compute
power of everyone who's working on
Bitcoin in order to subvert it that's
the way it's designed would yeah pretty
much impossible right the hacking that's
been going on is hacking of specific
companies that are set up and are doing
lots of Bitcoin transactions so it's not
like it's not like the validity of
Bitcoin is being compromised in these
hacks
it's like these companies have databases
or whatever
they're security measures set up to
protect their internal network from
outside hackers and that's being broken
into and that's being compromised so
when they say like 12 billion like you
know twelve thousand Bitcoin were stolen
from this site like are they actually
just meaning like a theoretical number
like potentially they usually they
usually when they're talking about that
are saying the number of bitcoins times
the current price of Bitcoin of what was
stolen and that's usually what they like
to go with is whatever the current value
is mm-hmm
but again what they're talking about is
like if you if you have all if you have
all your passwords to all your bank
accounts and someone hacks into your
computer and gets those they didn't
compromise your bank's security they
compromised your security right that I
mean that's kind of I mean that's a it's
it's just a dilute you know yeah
okay so Bitcoin itself is not
compromised the passwords of the people
who have set up Bitcoin wallets that
they deal with their compromise right
thanks yeah okay anyway okay let's move
on to perhaps a solution to the
ever-increasing price of doing Bitcoin
transactions this is just a potential
this is an MIT Technology Review article
and by the way this was derived from
Zola want X news video from yesterday
moment X so check that but anyway the
cryptocurrency without a blockchain
that's been built to outperform Bitcoin
well we have a crazy crazy
guitar solo going in know some hardcore
Christmas trees well my god
Santa knows how it's true yeah this is a
currency called iota and it rests on a
mathematical tingle that as creators say
will make it much faster it would end
more efficient to run iota as a currency
itself to jumps in total value from just
over four billion dollars to more than
ten billion dollars in just the past
couple weeks
it is not based on a blockchain at all
it's designed specifically to use
unconnected devices and the mathematical
concept that it's based on is called
Anna silic graph and I am in no position
to even begin to attempt to explain to
you guys what that is the dude who the
article references his last name is Suns
some stable
he says his team pursued an alternative
approach after deciding the block chains
are too costly so when a user issues a
transaction with iota that individual
also validates two randomly selected
previous transactions each of those
refer to two other previous transactions
and so on that creates the mathematical
tangle of the web that is then used to
validate the actual cryptocurrency
itself without making use of a
blockchain okay again not something I'm
in the best position to give you guys a
more in-depth that's explanation oh no
just to say that there are alternatives
to Bitcoin that are addressing some of
the potential shortcomings of Bitcoin
and the time it takes to process a
transaction and the cost of process game
transaction is definitely becoming more
and more of an issue with Bitcoin
due to its popularity right yeah there
we go that's gracious let's move on one
last story here in crypto currents and
yes might have seen this one over the
past few days there was a rumor or a
fake story going on about a guy in New
York who was selling Chucky Cheese
tokens as bitcoins and had supposedly
made it a million dollars the on social
media users were praising this hero
obviously the same thing to Chucky
Cheese tokens and coins he was
supposedly arrested in New York City for
selling altered chucky cheese tokens as
Bitcoin less physical he was selling
there's a little bit coins to people
physical bitcoins
who would be like Oh physical Bitcoin
let me buy 30 of those this is just one
of those examples of a story that was
written that kind of got picked up by
people because it had some of those
buzzwords and things the story itself
was Bank story itself was fake yes and
in fact the story was derived from a
website called the hustlers with a Z and
this are trustworthy already yeah this
article on Gizmodo specifically goes out
of its way to say please don't actually
go to that website and give them any
clicks because it's a fake like
satirical sort of website but also it
seems to like try to write stories in
such a way that they might be actually
people might think that they're real
or whatever yeah also it's not even that
original because this is a meme that's
been going around and read it for quite
some time simply comparing bitcoins to
chuck-e-cheese tokens and this existed
prior to this story coming out just
pointing out that although bitcoin is
not a physical currency chuck-e-cheese
tokens are they can also be used to play
skee-ball and buy pizza and they cannot
be used to buy black tar heroin weight
cannot be used that means Bitcoin can be
used to buy blocks are heroin yeah
theoretically if you know maybe she's
tokens are using so you know the right
exchanges to work on so I've heard I
don't know any what about the Google the
Google conversion is black tar her into
USD I would be interesting if people
just had that available to pull up and
the Kyle's point with Kyle seeing what
the current black tar heroin new
exchange rate is there is no automatic
conversion that is searchable in USD to
black by searching that from my house
fine all right
that's why I come here Paul I'm don't
this is completely worthless we're gonna
do another segments here which is ask
the audience we're gonna ask you guys
I just wanna fuckin cep you now the
question we're asking is what do you
guys want for Christmas because this is
of course the Christmas episode and well
of course not everyone celebrates
Christmas but lots of guys probably do
so what do you want is the point thing
whereas not support obviously Kyle has
his already has his own wants in mind
please bear in mind as we post this link
into chat that you are able to vote on
more than one thing also we're gonna be
asking multiple questions you guys are
so depressing in chat sounds like what
do you want for him to go what do you go
for Christmas somethings like a divorce
it's kind of said please help sir look
at the answers lord I need anime
figurines plenty of toys I want silence
I want silence definition showing that
I'm going to Ron Swanson routes on this
one good idea I want silence there we go
peace and quiet I want nothing to do I
would like to be bored for a weekend
really well it'd be great to be bored
what's that like again I forgot I'd have
a bored doing this only work to do know
how we figured like I ain't know so I've
been doing all this work so I can paste
this link into chat and do you help me
to pay sailing miss the Lincoln duh I
realize I still had I still had your
half of the show up in the yon that I
have two keyboards and I oh there we go
alright oh cool so everyone feel free to
vote on you know you can choose more
than one thing what you want for
christmas it's obviously very PC based
and then also we have the potential
upset of straw pulled out any
some sort of weird hiatus or something
right now a person I don't know so I
don't know this is actually going to
function or work so if you want me to
CPU we got a AMD and n so if you want to
do GPU we got am the region put silicon
and NVIDIA you should just put so
affinity to generic generic six of those
wouldn't people gonna get people choices
okay we could just put money cash Waco -
right I like that some stupid non-pc
related things alright so so beyond the
CPU and GPU we got Ram motherboard or
the PC party monitor keyboard mess some
other stupid non-pc related thing so
what I'm gonna do for this Kyle since
you and I obviously when it comes to ask
the audience is determine what the
audience this answer is gonna be okay we
have three things to decide here okay
first we got to choose AMD versus Intel
on the CPU write a second we got to
choose AMD versus Nvidia on the GPU and
third we're gonna pick what's going to
be the most popular of the remainder of
the answers that's that's gonna go okay
you wanna do and you want to alternate
like you pick one I think one you could
gonna pick one yes yes okay you go first
okay CPU front which CPU think they're
craving on the CPU front I'm gonna say
I'm gonna go with AMD cuz I I would
agree you can't you know you have to see
the other 100 I see we're arguing at
each category yeah yeah well fuck you so
I gotta be you know that's how I got
into Intel clearly for answer for the
second third like bitch you get to
choose first
so Radeon or AMD versus an NVIDIA GPU
obviously alright you'd be probably
probably you're gonna win that one just
based on just based on the bail joy and
availability yeah all right so beyond
that we have seven other answers RAM
prices motherboard other parts a new
monitor keyboard mouse something else or
hope now I know people like hope
but I'm gonna say lower Ram prices I
think that's really that's really that's
what I would have gone for it's really
weighing on people a lot that's a huge
issue right now and since I can't choose
that now that you have yes I'm gonna
have to go to the second one which is
gonna be a new monitor new monitor and
you'd rather have a new monitor than
hope I mean you'd rather have em prices
than home right right so yeah have you
seen RAM Francisco I mean you have to I
mean I'm not gonna have anal I'm not
gonna have any hope until I see improved
RAM prices yeah I think I'm like Ram
prices have been all over the place and
I feel like display technology has been
shooting through the roof in recent
months and years that's true so I feel
like someone who bought a display two
years ago they're already like because
that's the crazy thing is like if you
bought a display five years ago within
the next two years you probably wouldn't
have noticed much of a difference but
now if you buy a display like you know
2016 the 2018 panels are offering so
much more at least for like the gaming /
enthusiast market that like it's scaling
exponentially compared to how it was
five six years ago so I think the
display market is really taking off and
I think a lot of people are trying to
hop onto the you know hire fresh rate
high high resolution bandwagon IMO oh
you make a strong point there Kyle
indeed and I think it's time to see what
people think again everyone was able to
vote multiple times in this so let's
borrow a price oh look at this it's
tough number one I mean in that category
so I win I won the NVIDIA GPU no and
there and there are different categories
really right cuz we yeah we were
unfortunately although new monitors
right up there right low aye I beat you
there with my lower RAM prices but I
hope was just behind that but I had glad
I had NVIDIA GPU a new monitor which
would give me 25% total you know
you're not understanding the way I was
the way I was judging these that's
that's the Tasso cards fall so we have
to choose the CPU first and I went in
there because I chose AMD with that
crazy of CPUs half the vote and you
chose Intel which is 85 votes it's only
1% second was yours
you chose Nvidia so you win that one
mm-hmm and I chose Radeon Wow Radeon
GPUs man really not really they'd rather
get a new they'd rather get a new
freaking Mouse and the actual piece of
silicon because no one knows that they
could actually buy one for reasonable
price sorry you win that one and then
the final was everything else and I
wouldn't not with the RAM prices lower
Ram price so I went to a new in one it's
pretty absurd yeah yeah yeah yep well
there we go good fight GG that's been
that's what's wonderful very telling all
right so that means I only have a big
beer beer
it's still delicious it's quite tasty
it's still good
all right good so guys that I got back
to be that is most of my plans content
we're gonna we're gonna finish up oh no
ready no donations nobody have foot
where you go no no we're moving in the
Q&amp;amp;A but we also have some some some
Melton bring some of this stuff over

yeah right now it's mostly wing it
unless maybe a week or two ativy unless
there's a vendor who's like hey here's a

own scenario and my own situation I'm
like what if someone hadn't like
received this and didn't have a pair of
awesome Boyd Pro RGB Wireless I'm just
an interest that they were able to
in that stance send that oh yeah sure oh

since I spoke here me today hey I was
actually I was actually pretty excited
about this yeah the Corsair k70 RGB

ornaments here I think Christmas
ornaments it's really nice actually

actually carved that or whatever meant
I'm either probably the machine learning
it's got some looks like 1080 T eyes on
there something like that yeah it's very
unique

thanks friends interesting what do we
got alright this is letter
g'day Paul Kyle loves the show big hello
from South Australia hmm and closes 128
megabytes USB device that contains
primarily a Manero XM our minor as well
as a few miscellaneous goodies just for
you to the manera XM our minor was
totally developed by me and released
under the bsd license you're free to use
it as you wish or repurpose it to mine
for you please be careful which computer
round this up which computer run this on
as it is somewhat annoying to remove I
strongly recommend you wait GPL software
and Linux as they are a cancer on UNIX
and a gross mistake of history if you're
acquiring a UNIX environment the FreeBSD
is a good starting point I've included
an extra USB device for Jays two cents
please pass the logs it next time you
see him the font I use for the slitters
and then he talked about his fonts and
high quality German fonts that he also
included on
beautiful it's a very good fun Jesse
Wilson thank you so much for sending
this over the 1070 T I should not exist
there's also sort of a watermark down
there as well so good day back to
Southeast Australia Jesse thank you for
sending these over and I'll see if Jay
is interested don't plug in any of those
into your system with an internet
connection just just just to make sure
there's never any found you the USB
devices and have any problems with them
your tacky
Jake oh wait so hold on Yoda in Jeff $50
merry Christmas to you too
which RGB controller do you guys
recommend I have an enthu lux tempered
glass case that came with an RGB strip
and I added another wanted to get some
corsair fans and sync it all together
thanks an RGB controller if you're not
going straight here by the board I mean
there is the Corsair commander I'm sorry
the lighting lighting the pro from
Corsair but I think those work better
with the ll series or blink in-house
Corsair fans an actual RGB controller
but I'd recommend I haven't come across
any that have been substantially good to
recommend over any of the other options
I like the ones that have come in some
of the recent coolermaster products now
the master air shoot what is it over
there
will they work well of course as soon as
that's what he's interested in he won't
see it sell or share fans and sync it
all to you so you have to bear in mind
when it comes to RGB there's your
typical 4-pin RGB connector which is
basically RGB and power yeah 12 volt and
then there's addressable RGB strips and
those you actually have to have like
those you have to have something
compatible to connect to them to control
them like NZXT stuff with their air fans
and their stuff that's compatible to hue
plus those are all addressable
and you have to use them with NZXT stuff
in order to control them now we're
seeing more addressable RGB LED headers
on motherboards and that kind of thing
and those are cool for sure you just
have to sort of keep keep in mind what
which one is what if you're looking for
a simple inexpensive RGB controller like
I said the cooler master their recent
stuff that's come out just got a little
inline unit and you can press several
buttons on it to cycle between some
preset functions for RGB cycling or just
static color or that kind of thing so
it's a quick and easy way to add that
control but beyond that I think the best
way is to actually have an RGB header on
your motherboard and then use the
software that's integrated yeah that way
you can hopefully sync everything up
together as you be header on RGB headers
on motherboards are thing that we
prepared there nice sage advice Paul
Jake 3d for the $5 Samsung phone allows
windowed mode for apps
I put maps on top of YouTube for podcast
like Street headed home from fries now
holiday gaming stream Co cop all-in pile
come on pile oh cool I'm glad that
worked out for you gonna do a holiday
game stream a week from today
the day after Christmas is the day that
we're not actually doing awesome
hardware yeah yeah I'd be that Fritz
like a casual gaming streamer ever for a
couple hours of them
sounds like fun I bet I can do that for
sure so stay tuned for those news for
that news in case we do something like
that thank you very much Jake 3d for the
donation Zek Korver for the 10 bucks
thanks for the answer on Kyle's half I'm
doing blu-rays slash DVDs that are MKV
file 960 Evo is just because DVDs take
like 20 minutes in 720p fast blu-ray HQ
1080 takes at least 2 hours thank you
you guys Rock thank you for the
information on blu-ray discs and these
alike
I don't really deal with like optical
media much now so like all right optical
media close right I will say when it
comes to used to be when it comes to
encoding if I go back two or three years
my stem my standard for encoding was
1080 real-time so if you're encoding a
two-hour 1080 video it should take two
hours a 1080 video like a movie yeah
okay so movie but that's but that's
today two to four years ago now it's
it's better now one half an hour now if
I'm encoding 1080 60 I hope I hope for
about real time and if I'm including 4k
ambled for a little bit worse than real
time yeah depending on the setting like
that so yeah I don't know if that helps
you add it at all but if you're encoding
1080 blu-rays well the race should be
720 but are that teeny tiny what blue
Ezard no blue is a seventh way I think
really another tape yeah all right okay
I'm crazy coding at 1080 you should be
getting at least real-time yeah I guess
is what about it comes down to for me
true if you're getting much less than
that then maybe maybe you should
definitely look into what might be
causing it to be slower than mmm-hmm
okay set quick five dollars I found you
guys on YouTube I found you guys on
YouTube legit a week ago and have been
watched all your videos you guys are
awesome keep it up
Seth that's awesome tell everyone you
know what you just told us because that
will give us even more subscribers and
will make us rich so I'm making I figure
I'm just happy that you've enjoyed
watching our videos Seth it keeps us Co
it's really the only thing that keeps us
going is positive comments because I
feel like I'm constantly in
dated with negative comments so when I
see a positive like that Mike yeah we're
doing it don't read the negative Hopkins
do I know um you can't though it's it's
it's all or nothing
you either read none of the comments or
you read all the good comments and all
the bad comments richer's haters I know
they're cheating they are hating and
I've done a very good job of not letting
them get to me
but I've started to become more
defensive in a sense because other
people who don't really watch my videos
but will rather read the comments to
form an opinion on me or my videos or my
approach to making videos needs to be
defended because now all the sudden this
person is relying on what people in the
comments have said about my video rather
than just watching the actual video for
example someone who do you think that's
a valid way of assessing your actual
value as a youtuber I think it's I think
it's a you know there's there's
something to be said about no you're
supposed to say no you're supposed to
say no that's bullshit why what's no
monozygotic other person's comments
about me rather than just watching the
content themselves to make that
determination why would you be given
them the time of day why would you even
be considering their opinion to be valid
because aliens to your future because
youtuber because sometimes someone's
bullshit opinion about you actually
influences some regular person's opinion
about you if that regular person is
getting an influence or is being
influenced by something that is simply
hearsay then that person is stupid and
you shouldn't be valuing their opinion
in the first place but but that person
might not know is hearsay and it's
bullshit to just assume that if someone
were to assume it's hearsay
phonce ability to like like I can't save
everyone here I can't save the the app
influx of information that everyone gets
about you
you can't affect that hey at the other
day I feel like the viewer as a body as
as a singular voice whoever is
responding to my feet my videos has some
kind of voice there's a and it's an
average there's a mean there are some
people who love my videos some people
who hate my videos some people who fill
in between but based on all the comments
ever based on all the comments ever that
have ever been ever written about any of
the videos I've ever done they all
averaged out to a singular voice about
what my content is like and I feel like
I owe it to myself to respond in my own
voice to those comments because if they
have a voice on the Internet to reflect
what my content shows based on their
opinions I have a right to express my
own opinions like and like like and you
know this sometimes you make a video and
you make a video and you have in your
head and an idea of how you expect that
video to turn out and sometimes it turns
out the way it does and you don't fully
express everything you are feeling or
thinking during that video and then you
see the comments opposing you or
challenging you in certain ways about
the decisions you made in that video or
your rationale and choosing those parts
you know speaking on our you know in our
little niche here and if you don't
mention that in the actual video I feel
like the comments for me I've started to
see this is that the comments are now an
extension they're an extension of what I
was really trying to portray in my video
that didn't quite fully get out and
sometimes people challenge you based on
decisions you make all the time people
challenge you on how you phrased or
pitched or made decisions within a
particular project or a video that
you've done and you know I just feel
like I'm like I
not the the most amazing video producer
in the world
certain things slip through the cracks
when I make a video and need to be
clarified or justified or argued upon in
the comments as sort of an extension of
what that video was and so I'm learning
like that like the the before the back
and the forward and back response that I
have with my viewers helps us sort of
see eye to eye where otherwise you know
for the past few years I've just been
like if you don't agree with my shit
didn't just like leave a shitty comment
in the comments and I'm not gonna reply
but then other people who come in who
don't know who don't know who you are
are just gonna be like blind they're
gonna be blind and sheepish and listen
to that one troll in the comments who's
spitting all this negative shit about
you that you that that they're not
they're not and they're not seeing any
sort of defense from you and they're
like wondering what why why isn't Kyle
defending this point if it's so easily
like targeted if it's so easy to combat
this point why isn't Kyle speaking up
and like I have looked at guys like like
gamers Nexus like Steve from gamers
Nexus and Jay from Jays to sense these
guys are very like bold and audacious
and they're very sometimes abrasive with
how they respond to comments and and and
people but like the more I reason it's
just them protecting their their soft
tender center and then that's that's all
I'm saying is like I'm trying to protect
my soft tender center you know cuz in
the past I never would because I was
sort of that I have always been that
mentality were like I don't give a shit
I know what I know I know what I know
and I know how I feel and I don't need
anyone's validity but when that person
who's trolling you in the comments is
starting to influence outside people who
don't even know who you are then I feel
like it's it's all of a sudden the
challenge and it's like I need to I need
to step up and actually defend my point
definitely point of view and why i
phrase this video the way i did why some
of the things i did and a lot of people
you know
well the test of that I feel so and this
has been a very long rant that I've
given way too much a whole bit I try to
respond quickly sorry there's a story
that him I'm not sure if you've heard
this bringing this up we heard the story
the story of the true art the true
artists maturity so yeah so there's an
artist and whatever he grows up he's
from whatever situation he's in mm-hmm
he's an artist he wants to be an artist
tea he wants to paint so he has an attic
he lives in the attic and he spends
years working on this masterpiece
painting it you know doing a little bit
to touch up here and there and your day
getting it you know getting it down to
its essence of the most pure expression
of themselves as an artist that they can
give yeah he finally finishes one day
yeah and he stands back and looks at his
work and then he walks forward and
lights it on fire and leaves
it's very monk like it's like the monk
mentality just all right burn it all to
the ground the the moral of the story is
the artist is not creating art for
anyone but themselves
yeah so if you are creating if you're if
you feel the you an artist or if you
feel that you're creating something that
your your your your validation should
come from yourself from internal if
you're creating art you should not be
creating art because you want that to be
seen by other people Wren's
and acclaimed or or or studied and
judged to be good or bad or anything
like that you should just be creating
art and once it is created and once you
have observed
because you're the only one who matters
right in that context beyond that
nothing matters I understand that fully
it's it I understand the very idealist
and there's no that fully it's very like
you know like you know I did it for me
and I'm proud of it I'm happy with the
video that I made and so that's all that
matters doesn't matter what anyone else
thinks but at the same time like I get I
get off I get a high off of when other
people enjoy the content that I make I
think that's a huge motivating factor
for me is when I get positive responses
and positive feedback from content that
I make and it's it propels me to making
more content that I genuinely enjoy
making is is that is the sort of
response right it's a it's an act and a
response and I feel like sometimes when
that response has been sabotaged by some
people in the comments who don't know
what they're talking about or say brash
things that just don't make sense I feel
the need to defend my position in order
to get more people motivated about the
content that I create because that's
what motivates me at the end of the day
I don't know if that makes any sense but
it does it does make sense and I would
certainly agree with you to like for me
though when it comes to that perspective
on on feedback I know we're getting
we're getting deep we've been drinking
that's really what I can't stand to help
looking for me when it comes back down
to that feedback I feel like there's a
there's like a there's like a cutoff
there's a very significant difference
between the generic feedback of someone
who just wants to fire off and be heard
with whatever their opinion is right and
someone who has watched the content or
thought about it and actually provided
some sort of constructive right like
right that I feel like there's there's
the very generic base like the troll
versus like the actual guy go over it
versus someone who's like look I have
really tried to see exactly what
trying to come across it and by the way
we're talking about this in terms of
like as if every single video we make is
some artistic no it fees which is
obviously not the case my videos suck
but there are videos we feel good decent
man everything so true point is yeah but
see like I'm not talking about the
outright trolls who are just like fuck
you and everything you stand for sucks
stop trying to be funny your dick dick
white or whatever like I'm not actually
even talking about those people I'm talk
I'm moreso talking about the people who
are offering constructive criticism or
have like outlandishly different ideas
or perceptions that I do that I'm like
I'm just trying to sort of curate you
know sort of what what my perspective is
in everything because as the other day
the people who are outright trolls who
are just like name-calling and being
outright mean I feel like the general
public is smart enough to ignore those
people and I don't I don't worry about
the trolls influencing the majority of
people who come across my channel be
like oh yeah Kyle is a douche bag
asshole cunt as you mentioned in this
comment like that that sounds
scientifically accurate I'm not worried
about those people like they can say
whatever bulghur vulgarities they want
it doesn't really bother me at all
because I know the majority people are
smart enough to ignore it but it's more
so just people who are coming off as
like it's sort of like it's a gray area
right it's like it's constructive
criticism but sort of degrading in a
sense - or it's like they're not calling
you names but they're also like kind of
shitting on your your plan or your idea
or your your sort of goals that you had
from the video or whatever it is so it's
it's complicated it's it's it's not it
ain't easy man a youtuber I'll tell you
that it's why not many people do it but
you know I've I do the best I can
I do the best I can dealing with the
stuff I wish I was like jay-z I think I
wish I was like Jay said I wish I was
like hardcore Jay style really like we
all just feel like Jay that's what you
think about I talked about this but deep
down deep down well of course he's heavy
deep down he gets to me it's a big I
know he is but he just has this like
amazing exterior that like ah can you
let UJ trust me we did we talk a lot
about this during the the tank build and
stuff we can be a dick hole
absolutely absolutely
I'm sorry it's all right that's right we
should wrap this all up though so we
have a few more donation comments to go
over here yep as well as some johnson
sheds okay where did you cut off uh I
think quick was a $5 donation so we're
on Michael dam run for the $5 does any x
1050 bottleneck of 7700 K are non K
sorry I'm planning on upgrading my GPU
but should I upgrade my CPU as well I
think you're fine yeah I mean a seventy
seven hundred and nine K will be able to
get all the performance out of it's an
eft that you want you your cpu heavy a
lot of cpu power and lot less GPU power
so I would yeah I would consider an
upgraded GPU in your case if that's
within budget but as far as your current
setup if you're playing at 1080 you're
probably you're decently okay
yeah I would agree next we got David
shadow a five us Arjun Australian thanks
to your vids I overclocked my 6600 K and
managed to delay a CPU upgrade for at
least another year nice of the awesome
content that's great news David with
breeze with the launch cadence that
Intel has gone with for the past year
and a half the 6600 K it's the decent
overclock has long legs hell yeah for
sure blue five seven nine nine five
dollars pin my PC check out my build
breath thanks for the great content
please do a beer Zamboni for a brother
dicks dude says its enemy next week
we'll be sure to check them out thank
you very much sir
okay three seven oh six two weeks we
hope in the streets you're right two
weeks $50 from from K three 707 thank
you very much sir for my elite build
Kyle I was able to get those pom press
combos to fit there by using singularity
computers ethereal dual reservoirs and
mount I'll have to look into that that's
for sure something that I'll remember I
also had to drill holes in the panel to
get them to fit I figured as much with
the panel that you were using I'm very
familiar with the sort of like mounting
layouts and I was like there's no way
that you could fit two two dual res pom
prizes there but I owe it all to you
guys thanks for teaching me I hope the
rest of your build goes smoothly it
looks like it did based on the pictures
you were sending with all the fluid and
thought looks great indeed thanks auntie
three Zen art x five dollars what would
you do for a Klondike bar I have to pee
I'll be really quick describe we skipped
it you skipped dingo on my 14 you had a
$5 donation that was a very abrupt like
suddenly I have to pee
sorry the dogs are freaking out now to
tinkle on my 40th $5 donation said might
go for the courser k95 remembered tile
have had a good review of it in January
thanks for the advice have a great
holiday and a happy new year
dig go out of my 48 I think you'd be
very happy with the k95 it's a really
nice keyboard Zen art x5 dog donation
asked what would you do for a Klondike
bar bar and Zen I will say that I did a
Twitter Q&amp;amp;A yesterday that hasn't been
posted to YouTube yet where I answer
this question very specifically he said
I want to answer it now to spoil that so
give me a 24 to 48 hours and I'll post
that video up to your metal god 69 $5
donation how do i pimp my PC without
Twitter I refuse to be a twit I'm
getting parts ready for a build and
might define our five and want your
opinions that's a good question because
typically when we do pet my PC Kyle
usually sets it up and it's usually the
day of on a Tuesday and he usually
tweets and then he gets the responses to
those sweets and that's how he picks the
pet my PC systems that we go over I I
don't I don't know a good alternative
solution to that if you don't have
twitter at
I'm not sure maybe you should make a
Twitter account a message Cal and ask
what you should do instead okay
message from chat from Andrew Flores or
a flow oh yeah
a flow a flow whoo I am bested pretty
severely in Cal's half of the show he
said the PC is no longer in the cart on
the carpet
lmao so a flow thank you for doing that
thank you for moving that up off the
carpet
you're a very nice system and it
deserves to be in a place of higher
zhuzh Jung Joo Jung I believe $10.80 hey
guys happy holidays I was enjoy your
show right after WWE Smackdown I want to
buy a zero insertion force shirt but can
you explain what it means so like in
certain I can this is the zero insertion
force right there and my basic idea for
this right like zero insertion force is
the classification for a type of socket
the type of CPU socket which requires
zero insertion force so ambe's current
name for CPUs previous PGA CPUs they've
all been zero insertion force sockets
I've always thought this sounded very
funny because it's insertion force right
it sounds like you're pushing the penis
into something right I mean if we're
gonna if we're gonna just be black and
white with a language here anyway and go
zero insertion force and that is like I
write the sockets and then I thought
zero insertion force like a force like
like Powerpuff Girls kind of so that's
kind of what this vaguely designed after
and then these are actually all
different specific sockets so the dude
in the middle there is 939 going back to
when Andy was was super awesome in mid
2000s there's also this dude over here
on the left who is super socket seven
you can tell by the seven on his his
cape right there
super socket seven was actually a socket
that had both AMD and Intel CPUs could
both slot into that same socket pretty
crazy finally over here on the
the yellow say the right the left the
left is yellow keep and that is suck at
FM 2 which is an AMD socket and I
included because it's an a it's an APU
socket and it was one of the more modern
modern ones at the time that was also a
ZIF socket so there you go zero
insertion force our Intel like LGA
current like current modern CPUs they're
they're not zero insertion LGA is not
zero insertion force I see yeah because
technically this force like when you
when you push your levers back then it's
like downward force not yeah so your
insertion force that all the like a.m. 4
seconds whatever you just like if you if
the sock is there and open and the
levers up and you take the CPU and set
it there it goes that makes sense
because like current Intel CPU there's
an actual bracket that goes over the CPU
to compress it downward yes actually
with some pictures down yeah in order to
take all the all those little pins in
the socket Brett really be compressed
right down to the point where they all
match up with words like a name for CPU
for example Rison there is force but
it's not downward force it's like it's
just clamping the pins sideways right
it's sort of like kind again from a
lateral yeah first and usually not
usually not doing a very good job of it
either since it seems from any CPU
cooler extension most CPU cores when you
pull off just and do that hey all right
cool we're we're Michael Percoco 50
freaking dollars to go Kyle you've done
it by sea by land the only thing left is
to take that Titan V in skydive next
time I saw waiting for you to follow up
housecleaning video they're asking me do
I get a skydive and you got to clean
your house hey how was that even fair
setting the standards here Jesus is that
the 0g built a computer in zero-g
function you should make in your house
in zero gravity I should say that'd be
super fun don't know how we'd set that
up but it sounds
fun we're working in it Damian Robles
six dollars and sixty six cents happy
holidays guys and never get to catch it
live Cheers
I will be building a second PC very soon
thanks to both your knowledge that you
share Thank You Damian good luck on the
build on the build sue sheepdog $5.00
its senior sheepdog Wow thanks for
correcting me immediately you are glad
you are going to do a delayed video Paul
I recommend a rocket 88 dealing tool I
saw around a 20 degree Celsius drop on
my overclocked CPUs Merry Christmas oh
well I dunno I'm gonna museum there bars
are gonna be living tools cuz that's
what I have
yep yeah nice Ryan I got pay $5 so do
you so you mean to say that you both
received wood this year for Christmas
essentially Oh yep I mean you know that
basically as stiff as it gets as it
comes to me for sure Fred wrench turns
no request was to create a straw poll
and let everyone choose Kyle's
punishment for time heaters for the time
you took of his wedding okay the wedding
ring ah yes because that is punishable
by death apparently that's one of I'm
sure that was just taking it off is it
then you claimed afterwards that you had
no recollection of that ever happening
they shot extensively stop bringing up
the past
Tom's bren's it's time your Regent Crona
I used to pitch and it has audio only
option in quality settings that works
like Spotify you can listen to the
stream while screen is locked
oh yeah oh well there you go for those
of you who are wanting a podcast audio
only version of the show maybe look into
that sounds like a possibility thank you
very much thomas jake 3d $5 bitcoin is
basically unhackable because you need
around 500 largest miners /
supercomputers to hack it hackers or
hacks are to payment systems or wallets
I'm sure you know more that's it yeah
that's basically true thing Thank You
Jake and you agree yep I agree John Jake
3d has a
Euan of this for $5.00 they get into
your wallet and send your money to them
or change the payment address on a
website to their address should I see OD
World War 2 Call of Duty World War 2
destiny 2 or SW bf I have no idea what
Oh Star Wars Battlefront definitely not
Star Wars Battlefront I would say
destiny - definitely - yeah probably
this thing - yeah never gonna call it
Call of Duty familis it was modern
warfare 2 so that's needs you for sure
Fred grant $5 Kyle you're great just
replied to the haters hashtag or quotes
kiss my ass and then delete them I would
not pick on you if you were not so great
I am not to the point where like I'm
gonna outright ban people or you know
shun their comments like I believe in
free speech I'm not gonna like ban your
comments or whatever but I will reply
more often than I used to I feel like I
don't know just being around guys like
Jace you sense and and even like gamers
Nexus and stuff like I've been more
vocal lately about defending defending
myself and my content and my decisions
that they make in the comments section
of my videos because I feel like
sometimes I don't I don't always have
the bandwidth to reply to every single
comment on my videos obviously but as
long as I can like reply to said haters
or people who are just misinformed on my
videos I feel like I'm still in the
sense interacting with my audience on an
on a greater scale because I'm
potentially answering questions that
they might have some hater might ask me
because like Kyle why would you ever do
that what the fuck and if I don't ever
respond some other person who's maybe
not as knowledgeable or into PCs might
read that comment and also be wondering
yeah Kyle why did you do that and I feel
like I'm no longer at that point just
answering or responding to that one
troll or someone who's being a really
hard critic but I'm also answering maybe
some questions from a very quiet
minority that would otherwise you know
just sort of take whatever the original
troll commenters truth was for for for
actual fact so I don't know
finally double our nation $5 so
elimination backlit key caps in or
future what backlit key caps in or
future in or what does that mean
