hey guys welcome to Paul's hardware
today is a very special video because I
have a brand new SSD here from Intel
this is the Intel 750 series SSD
first-ever nvme consumer drive available
on the market 1.2 terabytes
just an insanely fast drive pretty much
the fastest drive that you can get right
now if you're looking at the consumer
side so to help me talk about this new
product from Intel I have JJ from Asus
yes what JJ is here welcome JJ thanks
for being here today JJ as you guys
might knows until the Asus Technical
Marketing Manager we have many names we
call him dr. Asus the the Prince of
perspicuity thank you thank you thanks
for being here but why are you here JJ
what does Asus have to do with this new
intel SSD you know pretty much the
section just started off with a
conversation right I've reached out to
you because I'm really excited about
this you know asus has always been
somebody that's at the forefront of
performance innovation and design and
supporting the latest generation
standards so you know we were at the
beginning when the first set of 6g
implementations came to the market we
are at the beginning for first USB 3 USB
3.1 Thunderbolt and so many others
you know storage related technologies
and when Intel first kind of came to us
that they were really looking to kind of
set a new precedence and push forward
with nvme which is the standard in terms
of the protocol and the interface that
helps to replace the current HCI
protocol we were like 100 percent we
want to be part of that we want to work
with you to help to make sure that we
can have a hundred percent ready
solution with you guys providing all the
awesome work that you guys are doing in
terms of the controller the high quality
validation the NAND all that great stuff
that you're bringing to the table and
then we can bring our expertise of
course in motherboard design the
interoperability and the validation and
all the work that we're going to need to
do to be able to make this seamlessly
handshake to bring you ultimately a
combination of course having the
motherboards to support these awesome
SSD solutions that Intel's
available not only with the 2.5 inch
version but also with the PCI Express
adding card version so so that's pretty
much where does until why don't work
with the established reputable top-tier
board manufacturer like asus to make
sure that everything worked together yet
like you said testing validation because
there's lots of different possible
scenarios configurations that this drive
might be set up in but let's uh let's
let's go let's talk some headlines for
right now because if you guys are into
SSDs and you know what SSD specs
typically are especially if you're
accustomed to SATA rev3 SSDs in those
specs the specs and things will blow you
away we already mentioned 2.4 I'm sorry
yeah 2.4 gigabytes per second reads
that's correct yeah writes are about in
the 1.2 gigabytes 1.25 yeah and even
those actually specifications to be
honest they're a bit conservative when
Intel was actually doing the initial
kind of validation and the performance
analysis testing was still with early
generation firmware that hadn't been
finalized and fine-tuned and at this
point you're definitely seeing that
actually in real-world testing and
synthetics we're actually getting over
those markers so that's kind of its kind
of a lowball number actually yeah it's
let's say it's a conservative number so
you actually I wouldn't be surprised to
see even greater levels of performance
and some of the already testing that we
see we actually were getting to point
you know 2.5 2.6 2.7 gigs worth of read
throughput you know on the right side
you know 1.3 almost 1.4 you're just
talking about totally monster numbers
and keep in mind that the really
exciting thing is that this is
leveraging 18 channel flash architecture
right that they have in here that comes
from their data center their enterprise
series basis is these so you have an
impressive level of performance that
they're bringing to the table with it
being a native nvme controller which is
the other big point okay I mean you know
historically every SSD we've been
looking at has been limited by the ACA
that HDI protocol an interface that is
on your additional SSD so you know the
highest numbers you could see is going
to be no 500 525 maybe 500 50 megabytes
and then the only way we can get higher
than that would be through some form of
raid combination which in itself doesn't
always fall for perfect scaling so nvme
can leaves behind all of the trappings
and hurdles that you had to run through
that were really established for
mechanical spinning hard drives that
sort of thing it's an older standard
it's very it's actually very long in the
tooth we're talking about you know at
this point you know over ten years
that's a long now so especially with
everything advancing it's crazy that
we're still using essentially this older
mechanism which still could offer is a
great performance I mean the best ssese
on the market are still using HDI so
it's not like it's a bad specification
it's just not purpose-built for flash
but I think Before we jump into that
getting back to what you were talking
about we got those really big Halo
points and you know it's a PCI Express
gen3 by four interface okay so that's an
itself that it's just as crazy massive
bandwidth and by the way what I keep
picking up and holding because I think
it's fantastic is this little drive here
which is the 750 series 2.5 inch version
and it's thick it's 15 millimeters thick
but this is a 2.5 inch drive yeah this
is also available in direct PCI Express
trim this is going to actually interface
in a really unique way via MDOT - and
we're going to show you guys how this
one works there's another one in the
system that JJ has over here which is
just direct PCI Express which might be a
little bit simpler if you don't have
MDOT - correct but we're also going to
go over everything you need to to make
either one incisions work and plug it in
and work because there are some
requirements there but I want to keep
hitting these Halo points or talking
about uh input/output operations percent
yes so these are just monster numbers we
will talk about the read once again
conservatively you're talking about four
hundred and forty K so that's just
insane I mean then you take a look at
even high performance nearly raid
configurations you're talking about 100
K 125 to a maybe 200 K right but here
you're talking 440 K and once again
I and some of the real world testing
that we're getting at this point with a
final firmware in place we're seeing an
excess easily a 450 K in terms of the
read on the right side you know I'm
conservative again about 290 K okay you
could even be looking beyond that so
just overall truly monster numbers and
then a latency performance also which
isn't a measurement that's usually kind
of associated with SSDs it's
significantly brought down as well so
you're going to get huge improvements in
that regard we've also got you know
power loss protection that's built into
this unit as well so you get you know
that safeguard in terms I have not only
big capacity with great performance and
that ultra high throughput but you also
have a safeguard mechanism that's built
in there and and rounding it all out you
got
some performance consistency that
bringing over from the data center
environment to help to make sure that as
you full this drive on you know and
you're utilizing it over time you're
going to help to maintain that high
level of performance so even if you've
got 70 80 % of the capacities you're not
gonna have any slowdown yeah you can
still get a really ensured level of
consistent performance which is really
important because performance
consistency sometimes isn't realized by
users that as they fill their drives
over time if they're not necessarily
have a controller and a firmware
architecture that's purpose-built to
maintain that performance you have to
generally over-provision a drive so you
could sometimes take 10 15 20 percent of
your drive and you're losing that well
here definitely this is going to be a
premium drive but at that same time you
won't have to worry about over
provisioning you'll be able to maintain
a lot of that performance of this drive
is purpose-built for ok so those are
kind of the halo talking points for you
guys and if you're not impressed yet you
probably don't get excited about SSDs
and that's ok but not everyone
necessarily geeks out about this type of
subject movable holy bootable yes and
that's the last thing so yes you can
take this plug it into your computer if
you have the right hardware right now
and you can boot directly off of it
which is a limitation often when I hear
when you're talking about especially a
new protocol like this yeah a brand new
drive sometimes it's more limited in its
actual application but I really like
that Intel and working with asus has
done as much as they have to make this
drive as usable as it is granted there
are some interesting ways that we're
going to connect it I think yes I think
you guys are going to like it though
because it's pretty kind of mad
scientist II I feel like it's really
cool like JJ has explained to me like
they've done some stuff that's a little
bit out of spec but it was just to say
like hey we have all this technology
right now how can we kind of put this
all together to give consumers or drives
it just blows away their expectations
when it comes to performance but it's
also usable and functional for for what
you might want to use it for so guys are
going to be doing a little bit of on on
the fly be rolling for you because we're
shooting this the day before launch and
I want to post this tomorrow
so um forgive me if it's a little rough
around the edges but I wanted to give
you guys some closer looks here so JJ
let's start off talking about
compatibility if somebody is watching
this video and like this is the best
thing ever and I want it now what do
they need other than presumably at least
in a suit
exciting and saber-tooth motherboard
okay so that's an awesome question it's
a little bit loaded so first and
foremost remember one of the big things
that we pointed out originally is that
this is a purpose-built solution for the
highest level performance so it's PCI
gen3 by 4 in terms of the requirement to
be able to maximize that performance
okay so as you know right now with z97
phase platform it's an awesome chipset
great CPU but we are a little bit
limited in terms of the total number of
PCIe lanes so optimally most users that
are on the x99 chipset are going to be
the most suited to probably be able to
enable the solution ok it's because the
number of PCI Express lanes that they
have available to them so in terms of
compatibility the sabre-tooth x99 which
is literally going to be shipping and
bayed available almost in lockstep with
the availability of the Intel 750 series
whether it's the adding card or the 2.5
inch version will have a shipping UEFI
that is MBM you ready now this is
extremely important without the UEFI you
will not have the ability to correctly
have these drives work in their complete
and normal functionality whether it's
from a post and boot functionality as
well as from a performance standpoint so
you do want to make sure to have an asus
board that has that UEFI in place to be
able to ensure that best-in-class
interoperability compatibility and
performance now the z97 series of
motherboards we have already all
released UEFI in place to give them full
nvme support ok so if you want to drop
in the PCI Express card you're going to
be good to go 100% you'll get all that
performance that we talked about along
with all the features of that drive but
keep in mind that you're going to need
to do it in probably like the second
PCIe by 16 slot so if you're somebody
that was targeting people possibly like
an SLI configuration you would be
essentially eliminating that possibility
because you're going to need to go
directly in that option now some of the
motherboards if you look in the detailed
manual information will generally tell
you if maybe like the third piece a slot
will be accessing CPU lanes from excuse
me gen 3 lanes from the CPU but
traditionally usually third slots on z97
boards will usually be connected to the
PCH so since the PCH is far more limited
in terms of its PCI link connectivity
because it does it through the PCH as
lanes that are enabled which are only
gen 2 you're going to have a lot lower
throughput
okay now this drive because it's native
me architecture because it's more
efficient because it offers reduced
latency higher pedal ISM and just a huge
amount of improvements in terms of the
command chain even at operating at a
slower performance we'll give you a
better experience than you would have
from a traditional SSD or traditional
raid configuration with normal HCI basis
is that I don't want better JJ what the
best you want the best so for people
that want the best that's where the x99
solution will come into play okay so
with x99 far less to worry about
if you drop in the adding card because
you've got tons of extra lanes you can
probably drop it into the third slot and
still help us select configuration and
you're rockin and rollin and you're good
to go but always make sure that the slot
that you're using can leverage CPU lanes
as opposed to lanes that would be lets
say provided by your your PCH or that
our Gen 2 enabled now where things get
interesting is what we've talked about
in the hyper kit module so I don't know
if maybe we want to reference that guy
but this is where things become a little
bit more interesting so when Intel but
just to sum up so far we're talking x99
from Asus yes and we're talking z97 from
a suit and then maybe you guys are
working on other stuff I know you didn't
say this just for anyone who's curious
maybe maybe z87 we don't want to talk
about that too much yet yeah we are
going to be working on technically it
shouldn't be an issue to enable Pete the
adding card support of course you have
far less solutions on that our MDOT -
based Georgia sans e87 because mSATA was
still in kind of in trend that's what
you saw Moysey 87 boards so pretty much
on the 87 it'll be the focus at getting
nvme support hopefully a lot with x79 no
guarantees as if yet will project those
timelines later out but right now if you
want it z97 x99 for sure okay and then I
asked JJ early about AMD side as well
and just long story short there keep
your eyes on the asus pc DIY website
where i'll be posting updates as they're
available again that's sort of a maybe
wait-and-see kind of situation right and
of course definitely with Intel there
right now on both the mainstream chipset
as well as the ultra high-end enthusiast
chips that they have native gen 3
support work that's not necessarily the
case on the Asus I guess some and then
of course you want to be plugging in if
you're using that PCI into a PCI slot
that's giving you a direct connection to
the CPU and nothing that's going to the
PCH or something like that
correct now if you don't want to use
that PCI slot though and we've already
been showing off the 2.5 inch drive we
have a 2.5 inch drive we have a
connector on it you guys have probably
never seen before
yep it's very well it's not that
different from like like a SAS connector
maybe just bullies I'd say SATA Express
at Express yeah it looks kind of like a
fast connection but what this connector
does is it actually allows the drive to
connect to an MDOT 2 port yes they're
using this what is this little device so
that is called our hyper kick so that's
a special module that we design develop
to essentially allow you to interface
with this sf-86 39 connector to what
pretty much looks like a mini SAS type
connector it's already been used in the
data center environment but that's so
essentially what we have at play so
we'll have a cable that will excuse me I
cable it's already included with this
drive that will allow you to go ahead
and connect the hyper kit to this and
then that interfaces in with the x99
board and is able to leverage the PCI
gen3 by 4 interface and when I was
talking about mad scientist II stuff
earlier this is kinda what I was talking
about because you have one connector
here another another connector there but
it's allowing you to make use of the
MDOT to slot in the motherboard and then
you have you have this little guy here
this little cable right yep and then
this connector table it was this actual
plug called again so that's you can call
it a mini SAS nice yeah and then the
other end is your sf-86 39 based
connection 86 39 and then that plugs
into the drive right just like so and
then it's got a little another little
lead coming off of it with the SATA plug
so you can get extra power to the drive
yeah that is required because of course
this only handles essentially all the
data so this is required to initialize
and actually have to drive correctly
work so you plug that in and then you
just run that over to your motherboard
and as you can see or maybe you can see
when I cut it in the future it plugs
into the M naught 2 and then your drive
is connected yep you're running % and
you have full 100% PCI gen3 by 4 based
performance for that 2.5 and drive like
the performance from the 2.5 inch is
pretty it's going to be the same as the
PCI Express it's the same exact thing so
you have no compromise in that
performance and the great thing is also
if you guys are kind of wondering this
part of the reason why
I wanted to have this type of
flexibility support with this type of
drive - is that wall X 17 X 19 is
purpose-built for this you know ACS may
be coming to the market at a later time
frame with smaller form factor xi9
solutions where if you have more
restrictions on the number of PCIe slots
that you physically have this allows you
to have smaller form factor systems
where you might not be able to use a PCI
Express adding card but you still want
to have this amazing high performance or
even if you guys might be aware like our
z97 maximum 7 impact that actually has a
by for Gen 3 PCI M database interface on
the back yeah so you could interface
this guy into that impact board and have
that primary graphics card installed
right so no room for an adding card but
you could still have this ultra high
level of performance enable to you
that's pretty something like a mini ITX
now just from a practical perspective
it's is a bit higher than it just
slipped out to drive so bear that in
mind when it comes to compatibility with
graphics cards or that sort of thing but
I just I really love this this type of
innovation and the way that you guys
have just like if you fit it in there
and if kind of frigging works so that's
really cool um so that's essentially all
you need right now if you want to use
this drive yeah there'll be a little
condom really actually everything has
been because there's a driver that's
built into this because it's a native
UEFI base device which that's another
little Kabat is this only supports
native u-ace value based insulation
which that's ok because if you're
probably building into the system you
got to you if I comply a motherboard
like an ACS board graphics card you know
optical drive your if you're still using
that I can of course this and ideally
you want to be utilizing with the
windows 8.1 operating system to be able
to make sure that you have to continue
any consistency to have everything
seamlessly work but there's nothing that
you need to do it's pretty much
transparent and seamless like you would
use a traditional SATA base SSD that's
using the HDI protocol they're good to
go now there's a couple of parameters in
the ua 5 that if you want to tweak it
for the best post and boot performance
you can go ahead and tweak those and
maybe we'll show you those guys but
beyond that not too much to do it's a
pretty straightforward process
i'm still trying to figure out what your
reference was to a micro ATX Asus x99
board but yes let's take a look at that
JJ ok ok JJ so we're now in the UEFI of
the x99 see
I'm saber-tooth x99 and so we're going
to do a quick little where we're talking
about optimization for nvme drives yeah
this is pretty much just the way to
optimize your UEFI to make sure that it
is going to have the most effective post
and boot time and this would actually
also be recommended for any current HDI
base drive that is you if you if I
compliant okay okay so pretty
straightforward all we're going to do is
I move over into other boot and from
there we're just going to want to set
the drive to hard drive only essentially
we just have a blue drive early because
we only want to boot just that one
single volume okay you want to disable
essentially all pulling thicker for USB
support this doesn't mean it disables
any USB ports they're just not pulled at
the beginning of the UEFI being
initialized okay we want to go ahead and
have the next boot after power loss set
to a fast boot we want to eliminate any
set post time delay so set to zero
seconds and then probably one of the
most important parts is here we want to
go to CSM compatibility support I'm not
going to get into this this is a very
complicated topic but essentially it
just means that it's acknowledging that
the board only has the latest in
generation type of hardware that
supports UEFI okay and what we want to
do is if we have it it'll look something
like this you can manually set everyone
to UEFI only which would be an option
but you can also just go ahead and
bypass all that and just disable any
type of CSM support so essentially any
legacy support okay and once you've gone
ahead and done that you'll pretty much
be set at that point you can hit f10 and
you will have the most optimized
parameters to have the fastest pose and
fastest boot now for users that are
utilizing the hyper kit there will be
one thing that you would want to jump
into which is you would want to go into
that PCH storage configuration select
that and hit enable to the hyper kit
support and beyond that you would just
go ahead and Afghan and you'd be good to
go suta for that's it that's how you
turn on the hyper kit mode specifically
if you're using one of these with a
packet that's it okay next up we're
going to jump into the operating system
and we wanted to show you guys some
performance numbers yeah just in case
you didn't believe us earlier and then
also maybe like some real-world yeah a
little bit of anxiousness
much workflow example so um let's talk
about whose it while we're waiting for
the boot nevermind it's already booted
up uh let's talk about who this drive is
built for right because we were just
discussing this we might as well
continue discussing it pretty much I
think the easiest way to look at is if
you're somebody that was already going
to be making investment and the best
SSDs that were on the market and you
were definitely looking at array type
configurations this is a solution for
you regardless of whether you're into
gaming whether you're into content
creation whether you're computation or
analysis or any other kind of varied
workflow it is pretty much just a better
option than you're doing any type of
rate JJ was suggesting that that gamers
would want this drive like especially
maybe the 400 gig one which is a little
bit more more cost-effective and I was
starting to argue with and like JJ
gamers don't need that and he kind of
argued against me and then changed my
mind which JJ is very good at doing so
I'm going to leave this question to you
guys gamers out there who are currently
gaming especially if you're already game
on an SSD would you be interested in say
a 400 gig version of this drive if it
could make a significant impact on game
load times and especially things like
little stutters and hiccups that you
might get in game from having to pull
stuff off the disk let us know down in
the comments section below but for now
we have crystal dis Marc yeah and as a
special crystal this yes correct
and you will be actually able to
download this version directly from the
website but this is an important point
and actually we talked about this a
little bit before but mbm e actually
requires actually a new form of software
to really be able to acknowledge how it
can work and how it can maximize the
throughput that it has available to it
especially when you benchmark it because
traditional base benchmark applications
are really designed for HDI base drives
so they can't really saturate the drive
correctly in terms of showing us the
full real throughput so if you want to
benchmark this type of solution you want
to have optimal either something like IO
meter where Intel will be working to
release actually a guide to show you how
to quickly tune it so that if you want a
benchmark in NBA v solution you can use
that or if you want a little bit more
simple solution crystal this mark has
already worked directly with Intel and
details work with them to be able to
fine tune their application to have it
be updated to be able to benchmark
correctly
okay yeah so from here pretty much what
we want to do is oh we're going to leave
it
three in terms of that just to give us a
little bit less variability in terms of
the performance set we'll go ahead and
set it to four gigabytes in terms of
what we have there and we'll go ahead
and let it run through its performance
so keep in mind that of course the
highest level of performance would come
from this drive of course being a
standalone let's say a storage volume as
opposed to running the operating system
operating system is always going to take
a little bit overhead but one of the
great things that you have inherently
with this is that there's significantly
reduced overhead because it's mdme
there's a lot less things in that whole
chain as far as storage that the NAB
controller and then from there the
operating system have to work through to
be able to give us a better performance
so that's one great aspect of that one
of the key point to is you want to make
sure that the nvme driver is installed
okay to be able to ensure that you get
the best performance now it's not
required for it to work and you look at
great performance but you'll have
significantly reduced performance
numbers without the npm e driver
installed and where would that just be
available directly from Microsoft no
that's actually mph drivers directly
supplied by Intel Oh directly from Intel
okay so it pretty much will come
available to drive so you can see right
here we've already reached 2.7 gigs and
then 1.3 gigs on the right so utterly
just monster performance and if you
remember when we initially talked at the
inception of this video yeah we said the
number was actually what it was point
five two point three or four even is
actually is the radius specification so
you're getting an extra three hundred
megabytes that's ready that's for free
yeah that's for free because in fact now
order today you get an extra three
hundred megabytes per second has already
done that's like I'm three hundred
megabytes per second like three four
years ago that's like the fastest
performing SSD you may be a little bit
higher than 300 but yeah let me go back
like what excited yeah it was it was
yeah I was a little bit faster than that
but think about it like this from
perspective if somebody almost didn't
just gave you 300 megabytes for free on
a current SATA 60s sd and it went from
500 megabytes to working at 800
megabytes yeah you would be doing
backflips be pretty excited right so the
that you just kind of get it for free
and the fact that Intel has been able to
refine and make improvements on to the
firmware and even have it operating more
effectively it's fantastic and you know
this also gets to another point as it's
finishing off these numbers you can just
see that you know across the different
types of loads that we have here we're
just getting some insane speeds but
performance consist
see is another really big hallmark of
this drive and something where that also
gets back to when we talked a little bit
about different usage models that helps
to ensure that the performance that you
have is maintained throughout the
entirety of the drive which is really
important because if I start off having
really fast low times or have really
fast installation times or I have faster
responsive experience for my system I
don't want that to grade as I'm filling
the drive up more and more which is
something that people on mechanical hard
drives you never really thought about
right because more or less the drives
kind of performance was pretty much the
same more or less yeah but on an SSD
that's actually not the case as you fill
it up with a lot of different types of
traditionalist as these that don't have
targeted performance consistency built
into their firmware and how they're
designed you can have actually a lot of
performance that the only way to
compensate for it would be over
provisioning but um we can see overall
you know this is a quick just synthetic
wrap up but just pretty insane numbers
yeah yeah that's really impressive all
around and again guys remember if you
get this drive don't get through the
normal version of crystal this mark yes
you need the special version that's nvme
compatible yeah and pretty much there's
no other traditional benchmarks that are
out right now that are really suited for
in terms of pure synthetic testing so if
you're like an advocate of a tow and
stuff like that hopefully what time
you'll see updates of that but right now
it's pretty much I Oh meter as I've been
updated since like 2010 yeah I feel like
it's like Oh storage never changes all
right but here's our numbers there guys
two thousand seven hundred maker bytes
per second reads one thousand three two
megabytes per second writes the 4kq
depth thirty-two numbers are also quite
impressive alright one last
demonstration that JJ has set up and
this is just a video that we're going to
play back for you guys but it's it's a
demonstration of this drive in action
specifically using Adobe SpeedGrade
yeah so pretty much what we kind of did
here was we took essentially a 4k file
and input it into Adobe SpeedGrade and
what we're essentially allowing you to
do is see what would be the kind of
restrictions that you would have if you
use the traditional very high speed SSD
so we use the Intel 730 series SSD which
is nothing to snuff out I mean it's a
very high quality high performance out
of 6g SSD but it could really barely
sustain being able to do color grading
on one single 4k video frame and
ultimately what we're able to show you
is that we can not only do two but even
actually
the point of doing three which is really
the way you would want to have it work
when you're doing actually color grading
and lighting grading because you want to
be able to see those two different
sources at the same time right and you
want to be able to scrub yes being able
to scrub but while your video editing is
like so important and that's why I love
really fast SSDs to store my my actual
footage on that I'm editing off of so
this demonstration again just simply put
it's going to show three 4k images that
are all up on the screen at the same
time they're being scrubbed through to
do color correction and to match them
and to show that you know frame a and
the size then there's also going to be
fraps running that actually shows you
the frame rate okay and so you want a
course ideally have that frame rate not
really drop because that helps to
maintain the fluidity of the workflow as
you're actually in the editor rear and
the color grader and I think that both
of us can agree that regardless of how
you feel about maybe different aspects
of enthusiast usage that this is one of
the really key areas that for content
creators you know professional rendering
applications for anything like that this
is where you really see the solution
just coming into its own and profit just
an awesome level yeah this is this was
the thing that JJ showed me where I was
like I need one I need one I don't even
I don't edit in 4k I really don't I can
shoot 4k my lx100 does 4k but I don't
shoot in it very often because like
setting up the whole workflow storage
space all that good stuff that you need
for it is becomes a lot more it's it's
four times as difficult yep so to speak
as 1080 recording so being able to do
this three 4k streams off of one drive
that's one drive can you raid these
together JJ not not as not yet yeah
that's obviously probably gonna be the
next coach how many of these can we then
wedge together to make some crazy thing
like that but but even keep in mind that
you know um even if you were to do four
SSDs in a raid you could equal these
numbers you'd have to do that through
some form of specialized add-in
controller card because the DMI link
that exists on the PCH is saturated
about 1.5 gigs so it's impossible and on
top of that you would are also run into
controller issues it would be less
efficiency you'd have more overhead
because this Drive you know 18 channels
of flash with that custom 9 control it's
purpose-built to offer this
versus what you would traditionally have
with normal SSDs where there they're
such you're trying to scale them into
offering that peak performance and
there's a lot of other little pieces in
the pie that affect the overall
experience all right well guys that I
think is going to wrap up this video
thank you for sticking with us I know
it's been a long one but we wanted to
share this information with you JJ now
thank you so much for stopping by
awesome do you okay JJ just hit me up he
like called me yesterday's like I'm
gonna be in town do you want to do this
and I was like yes come here let's talk
about this so guys once again this is an
intel SSD 750 series it's available in
the 2.5 inch trim like this one it's
available as a PCI Express Drive
available at one point two terabyte
capacity and 400 gig capacity yep and
there's going to be an 800 gig yeah
coming coming out little coming in the
future so check it out it should be
available now on the links down in the
description down there while you're down
there hit the like button let JJ know
that you appreciate him coming by and
sharing all this info and um thanks for
watching yeah and it oh yeah watch watch
JJ's stuff too yeah thank you
uh if you have any questions on any of
the issues points or any other things
like that I'll be watching this thread
so I'll definitely try to come back and
answer in the comments but you can also
make sure to check me out at PC diag
stress calm beautiful thanks so much for
watching guys and we'll see you all in
the next video
hello everyone and welcome to well I
almost said welcome anyway it's just
being here with JJ's sorry all the time
like old times</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
