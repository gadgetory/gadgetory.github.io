today I'm going to be doing a review of
this Rose will line em micro-atx
computer case I'm going to start off
with an unboxing and sort of a first
look at this case because as mentioned I
have not dealt with this one at all
assuming I first look at it and then as
you can see I've got some parts over
there and those are the parts I'm going
to be using to do they build in this
case but I'll follow up anything later
today or tomorrow whenever I actually
get to do with all these videos I'm
working on today
and I will give you guys two my personal
thoughts in more of a review style and
how I feel about working with this case
now one thing about cases the Handy
handles I can get tucked up inside and
make a difficulty to take the box off
the more you know okay so here's this
case itself and this being a budget case
of course packaging we have some basic
styrofoam and pieces plus the covering
of course there we go packaging and the
plastic moved I can get it closer look
at the case alright so up here on top
Rose well line em user's manual we've
got sort of a exploded view of the case
some info about connectors all the
included duct screws and whatnot now
here's the case so at first look I would
say this is a fairly standard micro ATX
case two five and a quarter inch bays up
in front also three and a half inch Bay
- its USB 2 - USB 3 with an internal
plug mic and headphone as well as a
reset button and power button hard drive
and power activity lights nice mesh up
here at the front with a fan located
right behind it it's a blue LED fan I'm
actually be swapping that out that one
out for the builds because um blue LED
is kind of a matter of preference and
and since I'm building this for kind of
a small office that's not really the
preference Hey look black thumbscrews
it's a nice feature for a budget case
actual thumb screws that are also
painted black and just popping those up
real quick I'm also getting ahead of
myself
parts of I'm out there at the back no
Maurice Maurice here we also have a
simple oh this is like a D sub pop out
and some grommet pop outs but they're
here in the middle still on those
there's a 20 pin USB connector
I know Ari we also have of course knock
out here free input/output shield one
two three four five
expansion bays down there at the bottom
and 120 millimeter exhausts let me get
these off as well so I can show you guys
the inside like so
all right side panel ah there we go side
panels fairly thin as say as far as the
metal goes but again budget case so I
can't be expecting too much the main
thing is totally painted black looks
like a pretty clean paint job as well
which is nice and then they've sort of
rolled it over in several places so that
definitely gives it some more sturdiness
to it and let me just do the read
reinstallation the side panel so not too
bad although a little side nap notches
cot where they shoot it and everything
so there you have it
panel I also have mounting points inside
panel 420 and guessing this is also 92
and 80 millimeter fan mounts so you can
add some additional ventilation to the
case if you want some more of that
pointing directly in please look at the
interior a hundred twenty in the back
120 in the front one in the front set
clear one with the led here is some
accessories so it looks like they've
given you I see so these are PCI bracket
covers this is one of those versions
where the in order to install your
covers in the PCI base here at the back
these actually pop off entirely
so only remove the ones you want to
because once you pop them off you can't
put them back on but if you do want to
replace them we've got a couple PCI
brackets right there so you can pop
those into place
also black we've got about five black
twists or zip ties for cable management
ooh
I like this look a speaker I find so
many cases these days and many of them
don't come with speakers and
motherboards don't always have a speaker
mounted but I like keeping one of these
around because if your motherboard is
especially if it's a lower end
motherboard it doesn't have like LEDs or
anything like that
plug in the speaker you can actually
hear the postcodes and it can help with
troubleshooting all right what else do
we have these are kind of your standard
assortment of screws for mounting to the
motherboard also mounting expansion
cards here's another cool feature look
at that so this is actually plastic but
it's a for tightening other board
standoffs so you pop it on a motherboard
stand up and you can tighten or
untighten it because when you're
installing your motherboard standoffs
you should always tighten up as far down
as you possibly can
provided of course you don't strip them
okay so there's your screws and whatnot
let's see front panel okay now the front
intake fan has two plugs looks like you
got both the three pin yeah so the
little splitter here some molex if you
want to plug it in directly or you can
do the three pin to your motherboard if
you want some better control over the
fan and you don't want it just running
at full speed all the time other front
panel connectors 20 pin USB 3.0
connector HD audio AC net AC 97 audio
also these are fairly long so even if
your connection points it down here and
then the lower-left like way down there
you can still have enough cable lengths
to reach around to them without too much
trouble
also USB 2 of course for those USB 2.0
front panels that mostly does it for the
interior
oh and front panel connect 6 K as well
those are kind of tucked back away
hidden front panel connectors with the
gorgeous multi colored cable that does
always seem to have
except in some cases let me slip around
to the back this case is very light I
will give it that easy to maneuver all
right now so there is like a motherboard
tray there's no space back here though
so don't plan on you than any of this
for cable management because there's
really zero space at all but they do
have a knockout here at the back for CPU
aftermarket CPU heatsink fans so you can
get at the mounting tools for that
there's a bit of space right here so you
can wrap cables along that direction if
you want to let's see so there's kind of
a see-through look of it the bottom of
the case has some rubber feet yeah
there's a rubberized so that will keep
your whatever surface you have it on
clean keep vibrations down a little bit
front panel should pop off there we go
front panel pops off without too much
trouble so that's also handy because it
does have this mesh up here at the front
so that gets crowded with us you can
simply pop that off and use some canned
air and blow that out I'm going to let
Maya do this I'm going to put it back on
front panel back on some toolless
locking mechanisms for 3.5 inch and five
and a quarter inch base I was reading a
review for this and they said that these
can be a touch on the flimsy side but if
you don't like him just remove them and
not dome with the screws because those
screw mounting points are still
accessible there I don't know if you
guys can see very well on the side here
but you got another 3.5 inch Bay down
there that is not the front-facing one
the upmost 3.5 inch bays your
front-facing one so you can use that
with a card reader three 3.5 inch bays
two five and a quarter inch bays and
then also there's mounting options at
the bottom down here which n admit I'm
not in a percent sure of all right so
this looks like five times I this looks
like a three and a half inch
yes okay so you can mount another drive
there via the four drive mats on the
bottom so you can put a 3.5 inch drive
down there in the bottom and about SSDs
I think this is an SSD mount as well
surely I have an SSD sitting around here
somewhere yes of course I do alright so
as this D mount as well right there I
don't know if you could do both did you
do both I'm gonna try it I'll try it and
let you guys know because it looks like
you could probably drop an SSD or at
least a narrow one like that right there
and then put a hard drive on top of it
well maybe not it maybe with some
spacers I don't know I'll play around
with that and let you guys know what
happens but at least a couple more drive
mounts on there at the bottom because as
you guys can see there's not a whole lot
of the drive mounting positions in here
but again small case you're not going to
be cramming it full of drives I doubt
you're doing a reader a or anything too
crazy like that in here
but there's sort of a first look at I'm
going to go ahead and do my my build and
my assembling here and then I'll come
back to you guys with some final
thoughts so continuing the review here
guys and I have the system all set up in
there and this is kind of a look at the
system set up full build in it this is
with my permanent cable management I'm
not intending ever to switch any of this
stuff around because it took me a while
to get everything wired in there but
that really as far as negative aspects
of this case that's really what it comes
down to cable management there's not a
whole lot of space and I know that's
just sort of kind of goes hand-in-hand
with being a smaller form factor micro
ATX system and this is a fairly small
micro ATX form form factor system but
you don't have a whole lot of room so
you definitely want to plan ahead and
you definitely don't want to have to
replace your power supply like I did
because it was kind of a pain in the
butt but apart from that as you can see
everything fits plenty of airflow nice
space here from the front fan to the CPU
cooler to the rear fan I was able to fit
optical drive up top SSD in the middle
to terabyte drive down there at the
bottom build came together quite nicely
if I have any complaints again it's
going to be about the cable management
and also the corner up here
actually between the 5 and a
quarter-inch tray and the motherboard
there's not a whole lot of space to work
with there in fact I had to remove this
stand off for the motherboard in order
to feed cables up behind there and
that's actually really handy place to be
able to feed those cables gives you a
little bit more cable management but you
do I almost dropped it you do have to
remove the motherboard in order to get
those in or out of there which I
actually had to do which led to a bit of
a rebuild of this build but that wasn't
the fault of the case that was the fault
of the power supply um let me flip
around here to the back you guys can
take a look right there
and as you can see no space here behind
the motherboard tray but you do have
some space up here so this is where
you're going to pretty much be trying to
route all your cables through bunch them
all up and should at least give you some
space to work with and so in conclusion
I've decided to get a haircut and change
my shirt actually that's because I ended
up having to sort of redo my build in
this if you guys are curious why you can
check out my other video which is
specifically on the build in this case
but in this video I'm actually just
reviewing the rows align em so I will
limit my comments to that I will say I
really enjoy this case for a budget case
it did a really good job
I like the painted interior I like the
layout inside it gives you a decent
amount of room to add some drives it's
got a nice clear open space behind the
fan and intake in the front so it's
going to give you a real good airflow
and actually directional airflow from
the front of the case to the back comes
included with two pretty decent hundred
and twenty millimeter fans and this is
an inexpensive case it's a budget case
this were more expensive case I would
definitely be much harder on it because
you know there are always some stuff you
get in those higher-end cases that you
miss in cases like this but that said I
would if I was rating this on a scale
from one to ten which I guess maybe I'll
start doing I think I would give it an 8
but I would definitely recommend it as a
budget case for budget builders looking
for a micro ATX form factor but that is
going to wrap it up for this video once
again this has been my review on the row
we'll line him a micro-atx computer case
I'm Paul and you've been watching Paul's
