excellent
so last week I attended an AMD press
event as many of you deduced by my
tweets and/or a particularly insightful
conspiracy thread on the AMD subreddit
while much of the information shared
there still remains under embargo today
you'll be hearing about Radeon instinct
a new suite of hardware and open-source
software offerings designed to
dramatically increase performance
efficiency and ease of implementation of
deep learning workloads and although
there is likely an issue of my audience
who drools over news about machine
learning hardware and what it means for
our future robot overlords the book of
you probably want to know what the hell
this has to do with Vega the code name
for Radeon technology groups
long-awaited next-gen GPU family to
explain that let's first figure out what
the heck Radeon instinct is so basically
there's too much data it's generated
everyday by everything from social media
posts to traffic sensors and coming
through it is impossible without
networks of big fast computers and E's
new solution for this is Radeon instinct
represented by a hardware hardware
software combination of their new Zen
based naples server cpus radeon gpus and
ro CM Radeon Open Compute for deep
learning neural networks going into any
depth about this type of thing is beyond
me so I will be linking to several
articles in this video's description for
anyone who wants to read a little bit
further about that PC perspectives
write-up is also linked down there
because I Orion shroud a shroud out TM
for inspiring the wild theories I'm
about to share
so since GPUs can process massive
quantities of parallel operations
they're ideal for handling tasks that
provide huge amounts of data for example
analyzing global financial markets
helping the AI on an autonomous vehicle
deal with sensor input or hyper
realistic 3d real-time renders of
ray-traced environments aim D introduced
three GPUs today that they have renamed
accelerators to align with their
intended tasks and side note there all
passively cooled because they're made to
live in server racks that have their own
loud-ass fans the Radeon instinct mi6
has 5.7 teraflops of compute performance
16 gigs of memory
224 gigabytes per second of memory
bandwidth a 150 watt TDP and is Polaris
based so you could equate it to NR x 480
on the gaming GPU side apart from it
having twice the memory and a bit less
memory bandwidth the Radeon instinct
mi-8 has eight point two teraflops of
compute performance four gigabytes of
HBM memory a 175 watt TDP and AMD tells
us quite directly that it's based on
their VG GPU which is the same one
that's used in the r9 fury and nano
finally there is the Radeon instinct
mi-25 with a 300 watt TDP but no compute
performance listed or any other juicy
specs really apart from one huge one it
will use and these next generation high
performance Vega GPU architecture so let
me be very clear here that we're now
moving into the theory crafting and
speculation part of this video and to
begin let's assume a couple things one
is that there's probably only one actual
Vega GPU the chip itself the Radeon is
almost ready to launch and to is that
the rack mount solutions that AMD has
also showed us today have somewhat
accurate compute performance listed my
suspicion which mr. Shrout further
validated at breakfast the other day was
that if these two things are correct
then it's a simple matter of division to
get a ballpark idea of Vegas compute
performance these racks are truly
stacked with variants in the 100 and 400
teraflop range as well as the ridiculous
invent tech rack with three petaflop of
GPU compute by way of 120 mi 25 GPUs so
let's do math and remember that Nvidia
is $1200 Titan X Pascal card boasts
floating-point computer formats of 11
teraflops
if the invent tech rack can push three
petaflop s-- that's 3000 teraflops
divided by 120 mi-25s that's 25
teraflops
that's that can't be right what about
the other X the hundred teraflop one has
four mi-25s that makes 25 teraflops per
card the Falcon which has 16 mi-25s for
400 teraflops also 25 per card I mean
it's called the mi 25 the 25 is right
there the mi6 and mi
Linus
okay let's not rush to conclusions I
present you also this shaky footage of
Roger Cordrey at the press event
actually showing us an MI 25 card and it
looks big and also possibly dual slot
if we zoom and enhance there whereas the
mi6 and mi
maybe be a dual GPU card with two of the
Vega GPUs in it that would still be 12.5
teraflops per GPU though which would
still seem like more than the Titan XP
until you realize that the instinct
cards are referencing FP 16 values
whereas the Titan XP is measuring FP 32
computations so basically you cut the
numbers in half for the instinct cards
and you get roughly the equivalent so my
dual GPU Theory probably goes out the
window in that case 12.5 teraflops tho
and FP 32 mode is still more than the
type next P again this is speculation
floating point rock compute performance
doesn't always mean good frame rates in
games we don't have launch dates for
anything we don't have full specs and I
could just be flat-out wrong but anyway
one last thing to note
AMD says that Radeon instinct products
are expected to ship in the first half
of 2017 so if the mi-25 is among them we
could assume vega GPUs will be ready and
available in that time frame as well but
who really knows for sure anyway guys
that is all for this video I hope you've
enjoyed it I don't often do the
speculation things so let me know if you
thought this was useful for you at all
