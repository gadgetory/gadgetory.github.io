Paul's hardware net and it's good you

deductions from that I also have a
website called Paul's hardware net it's

also like a black one with white

epic water cooling build and i just
wanted to share just a few of these
names with you i mean i've got so many
tweets as well as comments on the video

a very well thought out name that is
that is we got Pepe Le Pew ok some some

wintermute because of the white
motherboard um he this is a Neuromancer
reference which is a book that I have
not actually read that's beyond me it's
like it's like one of those early sci fi
books very
original and I made me feel like I need
to go over if you're bad naming
something after something after
something that I'm not really that
familiar with but true really cool name
actually send that over to send that
over to sergeant ballistic ballistic
because he just got a z97 saber tooth

just a Slovenian word here that I think
there's no way that I'm pronouncing but
its Slovenian for monochrome computer

black to be a stormtrooper stormtroopers
more like white with black accents it's
