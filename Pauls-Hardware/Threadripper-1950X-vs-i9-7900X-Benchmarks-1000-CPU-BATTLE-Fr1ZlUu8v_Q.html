welcome to my thread Ripper review
Andy's first ever high-end desktop
platform launches today and it's been
talked about for months so you're
probably already familiar with the specs
on screen right now today I'm going to
be comparing the 16 core thread refer
1950 X to the 10 core Intel 7900 X
because they both cost $1000 and because
Intel does not yet have a 16 core CPU in
their X 299 platform that's available so
I'm working with what I got
let's get right into the testing setup
so so for the threader per system here I
have the AMD risin thread refer in 1950
X 16 cores 32 thread CPU I also got the
Asus X 399 zetas extreme motherboard
it's running the latest UEFI version
provided by eight suits that's 0 for 0 1
&amp;amp; 4 CPU cooling I had the Corsair H 100
IV to 240 millimeter all-in-one liquid
cooler now note on CPU cooling I used
DTR for bracket that came with a CPU
because I wanted to see how
middle-of-the-road 240 millimeter AC
tech based cooler would work with this
configuration since I'm guessing that's
what's the most common and AMD does seem
to be kind of banking on the fact that
people will have these somewhat
available to them I also used a little
bit extra thermal paste to get as much
contact between the block on the cooler
and the extra-large threader for heat
spreader as possible to try to get
maximum coverage over all four of those
CPU dies even though only two out of the
four are actually functional for GPU
though I have the asus strix GTX 1080p
i/o see it's running at the out of the
box manufacturer overclocked speeds for
memory have for 8 gig sticks of GCL
Trent and DVD are for 3200 memory and
quad channel the memory settings were
manually keyed into the UEFI for both
systems speeds are at 3200 timings are
14 14 14 34 and voltages at 1.35 finally
for storage as the Windows 10 operating
system on a Samsung 9 6
crow 512 GB nvme SSD and then games the
video files are on an external SanDisk
Ultra - 1 terabyte SATA SSD which is
connected via USB 3.0 this system is
powered by real as well tachyon thousand
watt 80 + Platinum power supply and as
you can probably see it's an open
testbed for the skylark X system a very
much the same configuration of course
different CPU the Intel Core I 970 900
x10 core 20 thread CPU for the
motherboard I have MSI X 299 gaming m7
ACK and then for storage I have Windows
10 on the Toshiba Oct Rd 400 512
gigabytes nvme SSD then it's all powered
by the gigabyte extreme XP 1200 M 1200
watt 80 + Platinum power supply beyond
that everything is exactly the same
between the system's the memory kits in
the memory settings the GPU is the same
and I did swap out this core sage 100 IV
to over to the 7900 X system for
benchmarking since that does affect
thermals of course the GPU driver is the
latest from Nvidia 3/8 4.9 for Windows
10 is set to high performance mode for
both systems and I'm also running AMD's
right and master software on the thread
Ripper system and Intel's turbo boost
max 3.0 on the skylake X rig let's get
into the benchmarks now starting off
with Cinebench which is a test suite
based on max on animation software
cinema 4d it can use all of the CPUs
threads to render a seam so the more
cores and the more threads the better
the score for multi-threaded scores the
1950 X definitely took the lead here
with a massive score of two thousand
nine hundred and sixty nine just shy of
three thousand seventy nine hundred X
came in at twenty to ten and then when
possible I'm also going to throw in the
seventy seven hundred K and 1800 X
benchmark results for you so you have
them for comparison now single thread
mode is also something that you can turn
on in Cinebench and it is a good
indicator of how cpu might perform while
gaming or while running software that
isn't multi-threaded like Cinebench is
the 1950 exterior shows it's single
threaded deficit when it compared to n
cell score of 161 compared to the 7900 x
with a score of 192 and then finally
that 7700 k maintaining a single thread
lead with the score of 193
CPU mark is next this is part of the
patch mark benchmarking suite dan it
runs a series of simulated tasks
providing you with an overall score at
the end here again we saw the 1950 ex
dominate with the score of twenty four
thousand four hundred and five followed
up by two seventy nine hundred x with
the score
shy of 23,000 CPU mark also has a
single-threaded test that it runs so I
dropped that in here for you too and
again we can see the same story of when
you're looking at these n CPUs of 1950 X
and 1800 X you're seeing relatively the
same score since these are running it
relatively same frequencies around 4000
240 200 megahertz and then they 7900 X
and 7700 kwin in single thread mode once
again
next up is blender which is a free open
source 3d creation suite that supports
the entirety of the 3d pipeline modeling
rigging animation simulation rendering
compositing and motion tracking for my
test that I ran lower is better here
since this is just the time listed in
seconds and of the 7900 X actually won
this test with a score of twenty five
point seven despite not having as many
cores or threads as a 1950 X which came
in with a score of twenty six point two
this just goes to show you that not all
software can take advantage of all those
threads and when it can't
the 7900 X is going to regain a lot of
ground on the thread Ripper processor
textas pov-ray 3.7 this is a free 3d
graphic software it uses the CPU to
compute ray tracing to render an image
1950 x dominates here since pov-ray is
very good at handling lots of threads
and lots of course about a 30% lead over
the 7900 x with a total time of 40 4.2
seconds compared to the 7900 x at 57
point 5 we move on to Adobe Premiere
Creative Cloud this is the video editing
software that I use and I'm rendering a
three minute and 54 second 4k video in
3840 by 2160 resolution with a 40
megabit bit rate the 1950s shows again
that it is monstrous when it comes to
content creation with a total time of 5
minutes and 15 seconds beating the 7900
X by about 30 seconds 3dmark firestrike
Ultra is next a test you guys are
probably familiar with the overall
scores are pretty similar sheer but the
physics core is more of the CPU test and
here we can see the physics score
scaling up with more cores and more
threads to the 1950 X as a massive
physics score of 26,000 896 and then the
GPU test shows again that a little bit
better single thread performance can't
you get a little bit better performance
from your graphics card
moving on the 3d mark x spy a DirectX 12
test which I don't think is optimized
quite as well for all of those threads
and cores because even in the CPU
specific test the 79
hundred x manages to pull out a win with
the score of eleven thousand six hundred
versus the 1950 X's score of ten
thousand three hundred and sixty nine
now quick note before moving on to the
last test Grand Theft Auto 5 I did turn
on in game mode here utilizing the rise
in master software now in Rise Master
you might notice a couple different
options at the bottom creator mode and
game mode basically this is an option
and be enabled to optimize specifically
for gaming just a little bit when game
mode is turned on two things happen
first off legacy compatibility mode is
enabled I don't really like that name
but it means that one of your two arisin
8-core dies in the CPU is turned off
that cuts your number of cores and
threads that are available in half but
it also eliminates the latency that is
introduced in communicating between them
now since most games only use at four
cores at max you don't really need all
16 of them for gaming anyway and then
the second thing is that memory access
mode is switched to Numa mode or
non-uniform memory access so that each
single core works with the memory that's
directly attached to it rather than
spreading it around and working with all
the system memory again that reduces
latency for gaming a reset is required
to switch between modes but it did allow
for performance on the 1900 X that was
in line with what the 1800 X experienced
but bear in mind that I'm also
benchmarking the GTA 5 here at 1920 by
1080 to put more of the load on the CPU
rather than the GPU the 7900 X in this
case definitely actually had more
choppiness if you look you actually see
that those 0.1% lows the slowest of all
of the frames that were measured the
7900 X actually loses to the 1950 X and
that was something that I actually
noticed as I was running the benchmark
so overall you got a higher average
frame rate with the 7900 X but overall I
would say the gaming experience was just
a little bit smoother with the 1950 X
let's move on to power draw and I just
have some basic numbers for you here at
idle we had a power draw 105 watts for
the 1950 x4 55 was what it hit at peak
although it was typically drawing a lot
less than that depending on what I was
doing to do some temperature testing I
ran the I 264 stability test stressing
the CPU fvu and cache the 1950 X
actually performed really well here and
I think this was partially due to the
frequency it was running out which we'll
get to in just a second 58 C was
actually the max it hit I was quite
impressed especially
I'm only using a 240 millimeter radiator
considering they shipped us all at three
hundred sixty millimeter rad and that
thermaltake unit the 7900 ex actually
got up to 74 degrees Celsius after about
twenty minutes so it was running pretty
warm although it was running at a higher
frequency as well and I've listed
several different frequencies here for
the 1950 X as well as the 79 hundred x
1950 X in game mode was running a little
bit faster across well not all the cores
because not all of them are enabled but
I didn't see about 3.5 to 3.6 gigahertz
frequency a third Ripper also has xfr
extended frequency range just like the
mainstream risin parts and it'll
actually boost up by 200 megahertz with
Red Rivers so 200 megahertz on top of
the max boost block of 4000 gets you up
to about four point two gigahertz which
isn't too bad at all when you're only
running at one to four cores and that is
why in some of the single trader
performance tests as well as I believe
in the gaming test we saw performance
from Fred thread Ripper which was pretty
much what you'd expect from an
overclocked 1800 X the 7900 X was also
running quite a bit hotter as we've
already seen but it was also running
faster when on all fours is running at
four gigahertz just straight up and it
also has that peak turbo boost max mode
that it will do on just one or two of
the cores and actually saw that hit 4.5
gigahertz max pretty impressive when
you're talking about a single core out
of 10 at being able to achieve that just
with the out of the box settings so just
invite all notes to wrap up about thread
Ripper in general first off in game mode
AMD tells us that it can improve game
performance by 5 to 20 percent depending
on the game that you're playing and how
much latency might affect it
there are games that actually suffer
from switching to game modes so do take
a moment to double check and I'm sure as
more reviews come out we'll see more
actual
tests in different games with dread
refer the XS are temperature offset if
you guys are call on mainstream risin
there's a temperature offset that tricks
the system into thinking the CPU is
hotter than it actually is
that runs the fans at a faster speed
lowering the temperature and allowing
extended frequency range to extend the
frequency range extend extent further
make it make it run faster so it's plus
27 degrees for thread Ripper just in
case you're interested and if you're
using hardware info 64 you can actually
see both readout so you can see the
actual temperature as well as the offset
which is always going to be
seven degrees Celsius difference and
finally I wanted to point out that AMD
told us every single rise in thread
Ripper die is abend and only the top 5%
of risin dies go into these chips that
means of all of the CPUs that they use
for mainstream rise and stuff as well as
threader fur as well as the epic CPUs as
well to get our going into the server
stuff the fastest 5% go to thread Ripper
that means XFR is going to work better
and that means potentially you might see
better overclocking over although I
think the AMD rise in thread refer 1950
X is an absolute beast especially when
you're running software that can make
use of all of those cores it cares to
workstation tasks and I would definitely
give it my recommendation remember
though that not all tasks can use all of
those cores and threads and in gaming
especially we can see that thread Ripper
does still fall behind Intel's best even
with gaming mode turned on at higher
resolutions like 1440 at 4k though the
gaming performance would level out
between these chips so that's definitely
not a deal-breaker especially giving
given these products intended uses
they're more workstation parts and for
gaming although people are still going
to use them to game also bear in mind
that Intel 7900 X is running at higher
sustained clocks leading to higher temps
but also making up for some of that
performance loss by only having 10 cores
rather than 16 I wasn't able to include
overclocking in this video but I will be
coming back to that to see if running
all of thread Ripper scores at 3.8 or 4
gigahertz can make a big difference I'm
also going to pick the 12 core thread
Ripper 1920 X against Intel 78 20 X so
