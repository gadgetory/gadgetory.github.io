back to Pauls hardware today I'm going
to be doing an unboxing and overview of
this corsair dominator Platinum Plus
airflow 16 gigabyte memory kit that's a
4 by 4 gigabyte kit and it's rated speed
is two thousand six hundred and sixty
six mega transfers per second let's
start off with a closer look at the
retail box as always and we'll see what
Corsair has to say for themselves now
this being a quad channel kit you might
think it's immediately suitable for an X
79 platform however due to the rate at
speed on this being 2666 I would
actually more recommend this for an Ivy
Bridge system if you're going to Intel
because Ivy Bridge has really strong
IMC's or internal memory controllers
also an AMD platform would also be
suitable just bear in mind if you are
going x79 with this you're probably not
going to be able to run it at 2666 or
you might have some difficulties doing
that take a look the side we can see the
actual item number right here this is a
twenty six sixty-six cast eleven kits
there is a cast ten kit as well it's a
little bit faster this is the Dominator
platinum plus airflow so you get the
four sticks
plus you get a little to fan clip that
goes on the outside and helps keep your
memory cool so that's a particularly
useful and I'm sorry in water cooling
environment where you might not have as
much airflow air flow to fan I guess
that's French
ddr3 of course four by four gigabytes
for 16 gigs total Intel XMP certified so
you got your extreme memory profiles you
can load up to easily get the memory
running at its rated speed but when I've
tried to plug in an X mu XMP profile for
2666 memory on just about every sandy
bridge-e system that I've set up it's it
hasn't quite behaved one exception to
that might be if you're just planning
ahead for Ivy bridge-e which is still
rumored however not confirmed yet but
Ivy bridge-e I would expect to have
stronger IMC's sandy bridge-e so let me
have here machined aluminum heat sinks
for convective heat dissipation custom b
PCB optimized for conductive heat
transfer we also have configurable an
upgradable light pipes so you can
actually swap out the light pipe if you
want
color the default is white any Coursera
link interface so if you do invest in a
course our link units to connect all
your course their products to you can
use that to monitor the icy temperature
as well as the activity of the units so
if you go for an all Coursera system or
at least a system which is primarily
using Coursera parts which is not too
difficult to do these days I find a lot
of Asus and Corsair builds because if
you combine all that stuff you can
pretty much set up an entire computer
sends the hard drive and let me flip
this box open here and take a look
inside
okay some plastic packaging and
documentation here at the back Quick
Start Guide walk you through the basics
for installing memory if you've never
done it it's one of the more simple
things to do with a computer or she
against defects which will protect you
for two years we get two year
manufacturer's warranty from Corsair
with this device and that is telling you
how to plug in the Corsair or the fan
I'm sorry that's the fan cable three pin
and so you get the fan let's let's take
up take a closer look at that to start
Dominator Platinum airflow to fans there
at the top these are smaller fans the
brushed aluminum finish on the outside
gives it pretty clean look
then we tucked in here you have your
braided cable with three pin and
connector cool there's also a clip from
what I understand how to slip actually
separate so two little baggies the clip
use the screws to attach the clip on the
sides and that'll snap on and then
you'll be set to go snaps on around the
side of the memory not just that and
your baggy of screws all right now the
memory itself there's four of them I'll
leave them here so you can look at them
nice and pretty all together you can see
the Dominator logo on the top they have
this sort of platinum I guess silver
platinum kind of chromed up top
crossbeam really cool look there's a
fair amount of height on these so make
sure you have clearance again if you're
doing like a closed loop cooler from
course a like an h1 10 or h1
I then these will do just fine because
you generally won't have to wear them
about clearance with that type of
configuration there's another look at
the actual product number right there
2666 speed cast latency eleven thirteen
thirteen thirty five one point six five
volts this is version 5.1 to that I have
right here I'm not going to peel this
off right now with just a little bit of
plastic over the Corsair logo I find
that's easy to miss but if you do get
this memory peel that off because it's
just going to get warm when you have it
plugged in and it's going to sometimes
can kind of melt on to it then it could
be really difficult to get off in the
future
on this side you can see the 2666 lay
out the Dominator and then the light bar
which actually runs up and under here
and again that will light up when you
have a mouth like then it looks pretty
cool I also like the all-black PCB
another very nice addition to any set of
memory I finds the green PCBs to be
quite unattractive so if you're going
for a kit like this and then there's the
coarser like plug right that yet if
you're for a kit like this I already
mentioned the platform's would be
suitable but why would you need memory
the speed well if you go out for
overclocking that's one thing
once you get past 66 or 21:33 if you're
gaming you're not going to get a huge
performance boost it's like really
really tiny and incremental you get a
little bit but not too much a great use
for these would also be if you're
running an internal an eye GPU so for
instance if you have an AMD APU getting
really fast memory really help that out
because those integrated GPUs actually
use your system memory and having very
fast system memory will significantly
significantly improve your GPUs
performance through your eye GPUs
performance so that's one reason the
other reason is it for just you want a
really nice looking system aesthetically
these are quite clean looking and quite
pretty this as you can probably see so
that's another reason and then I guess
if you're just looking for the best of
the best this is this is definitely the
top of the memory that Corsair makes at
least this being the Dominator platinum
series dominators been around for a
while platinum top-of-the-line so yeah
those are kind of your different use
case scenarios and there's your pretty
close up look at the corsair dominator
memory very nice and that's going to
wrap it up for this video folks and much
obliged for watching of course if you'd
like to see more videos you can find
them on my youtube channel and of course
you don't forget to subscribe and like
the video if you found it useful thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
