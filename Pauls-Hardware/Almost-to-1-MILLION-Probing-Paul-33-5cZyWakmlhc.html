what's up guys welcome to probing Paul
this is episode number 33 and this is
the monthly Q&amp;amp;A that I do every month at
the end of the month usually it's the
end of February right now so that I
usually start out by looking at the past
history of probing pulse going back
through the sands of time it's very
mysterious back there there's a playlist
if you guys want to check it out and
watch old episodes for today's episode
I'm answering questions that were asked
in the comments section of last month's
video so if you want me to answer your
question next month then comment down
below and perhaps I will first question
here is from a Jean Nicolas shareist and
he says in your opinion what percentage
of the price tag for PC components such
as RGB RAM sticks fans SSDs is for
aesthetics versus the items actual real
value also first time I'm probing Paul
so welcome and thank you for the initial
probing it's always great the first time
I would say 10% I'm just gonna throw a
number out there but my thought process
on this like Vasiliy it's wildly between
the way I used to think about it which
is that you shouldn't spend any money or
concern about aesthetics you should only
be focused on how fast your computer can
actually be because for a lot of people
they build a computer and then they tuck
it away and they don't really think
about it the performance is more
important than what it actually looks
about but I've sort of changed my
philosophy over the years and this is
largely in part because building a PC
for yourself now is more of a personal
thing you're customizing it for yourself
you're making it unique to you and I
think those aesthetic touches are the
things that can do that and make your PC
more like the PC you built versus
something you just bought off of a store
shelf somewhere 10 percent seems
reasonable to me because it's not too
much the one thing I would really stay
away from is investing like say 80 to
150 to 200 dollars on something like
sleeved cable extensions or an
all-in-one liquid CPU cooler that
doesn't improve your performance that
much but just looks nicer if you could
have taken the money you spent on an
aesthetic upgrade and go from say like
an rx 580 to a GTX 2060 for example
you'd be much better off spending the
money there on improved performance over
ascetics that said I do think it is
worth spending some money on the RGB are
just whatever it is that you feel looks
good often the case is a big factor
there people will spend 10 20 30 bucks
more in a case because I like a look of
one over the other but all things
considered I think it ultimately boils
down to
performance so if you're trying to
decide should I go for aesthetics or
performance go for performance next
questions from Ricky visas hey Paul
since you're about to hit 1 million
subscribers would you talk about the
 times and what your journey on
YouTube has been like for these past 10
years it's been an interesting journey
I'd say because I started out with
Newegg and we built new I got to the
point where it was somewhere between 400
and 500 thousand subscribers when I
initially left and then when I went and
started doing things on my own and it
was kind of like starting over to some
extent so I had to kind of build my way
back up that said though I think there
are three times that stand out to me as
being the most challenging when it comes
to my 10 years making YouTube videos the
first was when I was back at new egg and
it was towards the end of my time there
and it was just things weren't going
well and I'm not gonna go into the
details of why that was but it's just
frustrating because when you're doing
creative work it's very very helpful to
be able to stay in a positive mindset
and it was just challenging towards the
end of my time there so again sorry for
lack of details but the upshot was that
that encouraged me to go and branch out
on my own and now that I am on my own
there have been other challenges so the
second challenging thing that pops up
would be right after I branched out and
was working on my own and just sort of
the different sets of challenges that
come along with working from home
working for yourself making your own
schedule I'm not always the most
responsible and focused person I'm
easily distracted so I think for the
first year that I was working from home
I was just sort of learning some more
things about myself
what sort of motivates me to get work
done what can sort of hold me back from
getting work done fortunately things are
much better now and much better at
staying focused in getting the work done
that needs to be done and I think I
learned something about myself and
became a better person in the process
hopefully a little bit so that
ultimately turned out to be a good thing
as well the third thing I'll bring up
and I'm only gonna mention it briefly
because it was legitimately the most
difficult thing that I've ever gone
through in my life was at the beginning
of last year in January of 2018 my wife
who was about three months pregnant at
the time found that we weren't gonna be
able to keep the baby we lost our baby
it was really really really hard and I
went further a few months of pretty
severe depression because of that it was
really challenging to get the videos
done so not trying to get too dark at
the beginning of the video here or
anything but that was definitely the
most time in my experience of the
ten years I've been doing YouTube
although it was somewhat unrelated it
definitely affected my ability
to keep making videos the good news
though the positive news is that my wife
and I are pregnant once again we're due
later in April and we're having a girl
so look forward to that don't worry I'm
not gonna make my channel too a baby
channel or anything like that next
question here from derp of all things
with Rison being up for two years now
first-gen rising is cheaper and yes that
is it can often go on sale should i buy
their eyes in five twenty six hundred
their eyes in seven seventeen hundred
the core i5 8400 k or maybe something
else similarly priced sees focus is
gonna be gaming may be streaming maybe
some workstation tasks and like video
editing at 1080p so first of all there
is no such cpu as the 8400 k I kind of
wish there was that would be cool until
would be nice if they did something like
that because that's a problem with Intel
for me is that when I'm trying to tell
somebody here buy these parts and build
this computer my thought is that they're
gonna build a computer for the first
time and then maybe they're gonna like
it and get excited about it and want to
do other stuff with their computer like
putting aftermarket cooling on or
overclocking overclocking can be a lot
of fun it's a great way to squeeze some
extra performance out of your system
that you couldn't get otherwise
but insel locks down overclocking and
you have to buy case q processor in
order to do that and all the case q
processors are very expensive beyond
that until at least with their 8000 CA
nine thousand series of processors cut
hyper threading out of a lot of the
higher-end SKUs that are out there so
you have six core six thread CPUs and
eight core eight thread CPUs to get a
full eight cores and sixteen threads you
have to spend over five hundred bucks
for a ninety nine hundred k that's why i
havent been recommending intel quite as
much but if your focus is purely on
gaming you want the best single core
performance possible and for that you
definitely want to go with intel that
said if you want to do mixed-use stuff
like you're talking about here then
you'll definitely benefit from those
extra cores and threads that you can get
from like a 2600 or a 1700 so i would
say go with the Rison based on your use
case scenario beyond that
the 2600 i think would be a slightly
better choice for gaming because you are
gonna get a little bit better single
core performance out of that the 1700 is
gonna have two more cores and four more
threads so if you're talking about your
video rendering tasks it'll do better at
that so consider which of those two is
more important to you and then of course
reality check current pricing because
but I don't know I'd it like I can't
give you a direct answer to this when
the 2600 is 165 bucks and then the 1700
is also like 170 bucks or something like
I I honestly don't know what to tell
people it how much time you're going to
spend rendering how much time you're
going to spend Gaming one of the other
next question from jack Carnell a simple
question but a very important one
why is RGB so popular
check out my RGB PC back here arctic
panther it's got RGB lighting right now
it's all whites because it's winter time
and one thing I've enjoyed with my
computer back here is sort of updating
it as the seasons change and with RGB
lighting you can go in there and you can
have a computer that looks like one way
one day and then you can have it look
like in another way another day and you
can color code it with all the stuff on
your desk and I think it's just a way
that you can customize a computer and
then change it over time because people
don't want things to be one way all the
time anymore and I think that's why
we've seen such proliferation of RGB in
everything and I know some people hate
it and I don't blame you if you're not
into it
I completely understand people who just
want something that's like all blacked
out or maybe like a two-tone color
scheme or something like that but when
it comes to long-term flexibility and
just being able to on a whim say like oh
I want my computer to look like this
today
alright GB lighting this a pretty cool
way to do that next question from the
fat man in all the time you have been a
tech which launch had you the most hyped
or excited like a kid on Christmas
morning and are there any launches that
are upcoming that might make me feel
this way as far as like a kid on
Christmas morning upcoming launches kind
of maybe I mean I'm excited to see the
new rise in 3000 series stuff because
that's pretty imminent and it does seem
like they're gonna really be cranking up
the number of cores and threads that you
can get on a mainstream platform so
that's cool I would say this stuff
historically that I've gotten most
excited about has been like the high-end
desktop stuff I had an ex 58 motherboard
and an Intel Core i7 920 back in the day
when they first differentiated and made
a high-end desktop platform along with
the mainstream platform so back then I
got pretty excited about that
more recently thread Ripper coming out
two years ago was what really made me
think like oh dang that's really cool
because for one they didn't transmit at
all that they were even
working on that it kind of came out of
nowhere and then until I feel like was
pretty blindsided and suddenly you had
AMD competing not just on the mainstream
with Rison but also in the high-end
desktop space and I think it's really
changed Intel's approach to that we have
much more high core count processors
there now as well as on the mainstream
so yeah I'd say high-end desktop launch
if I can make it generic back in the day
with x58 when Intel first did it and
more recently with Dredd over when AMD
did just a few questions left this one
from a-z no new COO asks can you do a
step by step PC hardware maintenance
video he really enjoyed the build guides
and the maintenance videos and he found
on YouTube aren't very in-depth like
redoing thermal paste and that sort of
thing so Zeno nuke this is good timing
because I just recently have been
posting my updated how to build a gaming
PC video series part 1 and part 2 are
currently out part 3 should be up in
another day or two and their response to
that has been very positive so thank you
for the idea I think it's a good one and
I have been thinking about following
this video up with some other videos
that are more on down the tutorial path
but maybe a little bit more specialized
in certain areas so I think a
maintenance video would be a great idea
I need to find a computer that's like
super clogged up with dust and stuff so
actually thank my wife's computer hot
box would be a great option for that so
thank you these are great ideas and
you'll probably see a video like that
coming out for me sometime soon here to
levitate me has a comment rather than a
question but I wanted to pull it up
because it's relevant to a question I
answered last month about raid and he's
pointing out that raid 1 is not a backup
solution it is an uptime solution now
the phraseology here makes me think
that's here to levitate me is familiar
with like a server environment or data
center environments and this is very
true the main point being made here is
that if you have raid one set up you
have a backup and CMR to use in the
wrong word here you have a secondary
solution to get your data back if one of
those drives fails due to a hardware
failure however if you get malware or
other corruption to data or you get a
virus that's on the drives you're gonna
lose the data on both drives if it's the
type of drive that does that so for that
reason you definitely want to look into
a more actual legitimate backup solution
so if you're looking for something
entry-level just like a network attached
storage hard drive that's connected
somewhere to your network that you
simply drop stuff on to so you have data
saved in more than one location is a
possible solution more than that though
you'd want to set up something like
FreeNAS that has automated backups and
especially it's got read-only automated
backups so even if you were compromised
you'd still be able to recover your data
off of those so thank you here to
levitate me and hopefully that makes
things a little bit more clear for you
guys who aren't as familiar with raid 1
Kristin H just really briefly pointed
out the black ops 4 build that I did
last month and I have to tell you guys
that it has been given away and the
winner has claimed their prize here is
the build itself it turned out super
nice so I'll put a link in the
description if you wanna see me put it
all together but the claimants the
winner has claimed their prize and just
in case you're wondering how long it
takes in a giveaway situation like this
to actually receive a prize I am gonna
be shipping this out tomorrow I had to
coordinate with Asus Asus had to get
their information when you give away
something that's of a value I believe
over like seven or eight hundred dollars
in the u.s. at least it actually counts
as like paying that person money so I
mean they actually have to get the tax
information from the win area so that
you can send them a 1099 for next year's
taxes that's just how it works in the
u.s. if you're doing things properly so
all that said the winner accepted the
prize gave the information Asus got it
they sent me shipping labels I no need
to pack up the PAC well it's all packed
up I need to put the shipping shipping
labels on the boxes and ship that out
which I'm gonna do tomorrow the last
question here isn't a question it's a
comment it's from Pappy man and I pulled
this up because it was such a kind
comment also wanted to serve give a flip
side to the 1 million views thing that
I'm kind of teasing in this video since
it's gonna happen real soon I'm at over
nine hundred ninety five thousand
subscribers as of the filming of this
video and Pac Man I feel like you just
encapsulated a lot of the stuff that I'm
all about I completely agree with you I
am NOT as tech specific as Steve or even
like Hardware unbox they do a lot more
in depth benchmarking in testan than I
do but my main streaming descriptions he
likes a quick-fire advice I try to be
thorough I try not to mislead people and
I try to give you guys direct honest
information that's I would hope to
received myself if I was looking to find
more information I'm building a computer
and getting advice on that topic so
thank you very much happy man for this
comments I it it got me got me right
there I was like yes you you understand
what I'm trying to
here so thank you thank you all for
subscribing to my channel I am really
really looking forward to hitting a
million subscribers and getting the
plaque and all that good stuff I will be
doing a follow up probably giveaway on
that and then another follow up on that
later on I'm pregnant wait till I get
the plaque for that but that is all the
time I have for this video thank you
guys so much again for watching and
leave me comments in the comment section
if you want me to answer them in next
month's probing Paul in March which is
well March starts tomorrow but I'm proud
I can I do it till later in the month
thanks again for watching though guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
