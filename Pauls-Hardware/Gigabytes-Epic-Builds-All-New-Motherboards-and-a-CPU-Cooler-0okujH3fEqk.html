continuing here from Caesars Palace
which is a lovely place to gamble but
we're not doing that we're talking about
some stuff from gigabyte because they
have some new graphics cards they have
of course a ton of new motherboards in
the Z 270 line they have a new gaming
system that's kind of an all-in-one
units and also going to talk a little
bit about LED lighting but first I would
like to say a huge thank you to gigabyte
for sponsoring my CES 2017 coverage also
a big thanks to Toshiba and deep cool my
three sponsors they're great people all
right let's start off with this this
little product that we have right here
which I'm going to attempt to one hand
which is a very a skill that you learn
after doing this for a while you might
look at this and say oh that looks a lot
like the GTX tennety extreme gaming and
you'd be correct to some degree it does
feature a lot of the same design from it
so it does have the lighting going
across an X pattern on the front there
it also has lighting on that logo on the
side but it's not a gigabyte logo it's a
norris logo so continuing the sort of
transition four gigabytes of their
highest end gaming equipments to the
Auris brands they have now launched this
first ever GPU or will be launching soon
beginning of February first ever GPU
that's Oris branded and again to carry
over a little bit of design and stuff
from the extreme series does have a
little bit of a light orange accents
going across there and then the
backplate here I think is what's most
upgraded or changed you will note that
they have a copper plate sits there
behind the GPU to help provide a little
bit of extra heat dissipation gigabyte
was very keen to for me to know that
they're the first ones to have done that
so balls in your court other graphics
card manufacturers also that Oris logo
the Eagle right there also lights up
with RGB goodness so there you go a new
graphics card from gigabyte they are not
talking about clock speeds for that one
yet because it's still early but keep
your eye out for it if you like high-end
gtx ten eighties but over here look at
these new products that are still from
the extreme gaming line series but our
products that you might not have seen
from gigabyte before you guys want a
gigabyte CPU cooler they have one right
here to the XTC 708 features sixteen
point eight million
customizable RGB lighting modes no
sixteen point eight million different
colors theoretically
on the Gigabyte extreme gaming logo
there on the front so you'll see that
through the side panel of your case
depending on how you have this set up
duel 120 millimeter fans on either side
these are proprietary designs so I do
feel like it might be difficult to swap
them out but I feel like depending on
what fan you're using it does have a
standard Hutton 20 millimeter fan mount
on there so you might be able to get
something else in but these fans have
the same wing blade design as the
gigabyte extreme gaming series of GPUs
have so the special design with the rid
you know it's ribbed for your pleasure
and everything like that to help cool
everything better and the thing I notice
that's that to me the most with this
because obviously it's a tower style CPU
cooler with copper heat pipes and a
aluminum thin stack in the middle but
look at the size of those heat pipes
they're freaking 10 millimeters each
really thick and you know Gerst is
important so make sure you pay attention
to that also on the bottom of course the
flat to direct heat pipe contact which
has been proven by many CPU coolers to
be a very effective means of cooling
going all the way back to the cooler
master hyper 212 so there you go a
gigabyte CPU cooler they also have an X
H 300 gaming headset here and of course
you probably have already seen their sli
bridges but these are all available for
sale right now I'm told you can get them
on Newegg so um go there and buy them a
quick pit stop here just to show you
these also unique products look a norris
sli bridge because if you're gonna get a
norris graphics card you gotta have the
matching sli bridge pretty actually
pretty nice all-black pretty low profile
- it has buttons on it I know what those
buttons do maybe they change the color
on the logo confirmed press these
buttons at the bottom it has full RGB
lighting and it can change the mode with
those buttons that's actually pretty
cool alright we have an OC touch
breakout panel here that you might just
use for a motherboard it's going to be
compatible some of those e2 70 series
motherboards of course and you just plug
that in and connect it gives you a bunch
of extra fan headers a bunch of voltage
read points so you can use directly with
a voltmeter as well as plus minus
buttons so you can manually set your
overclock for your CPU up or down
usually these are set to different modes
in the BIOS whether you want increments
of like 0.1 or
their point zero one or that kind of
thing also power reset buttons and fun
things what do these switches for South
Korea jgp U and T G art you can turn off
your South Bridge your eye GPU and your
TGR I don't even I don't know what a TGR
is but I'm sure somebody in the comments
will point out what that is also it
doesn't want to sit down nicely and then
we also have this tiny little Nick it
was last time you bought a network
interface card for your to add on to
your system well if you need 10 Gigabit
Ethernet that might be the best reason
for you if you do lots of transferring
of large file sizes or you need really
fast connectivity between your computers
at home 10 Gigabit Ethernet has been
much more popular in prevalence in the
enterprise space but they're finally
actually coming out with little tiny
cards for 10 Gigabit Ethernet it's got a
black PCB and a black cooler on there so
it's actually gonna blend in if you're
building a gaming system or something
like that cool little accessory I hope
they're not too terribly overpriced
there are a ton of awesome systems that
have been set up here to demonstrate the
new motherboards z2 70 boards as well as
some older series 100 series mini ITX
boards that they have in some systems
but some really cool things that they've
integrated into these boards are lots of
our GB LEDs and of course not everyone's
into that I don't blame you if you're
not but if you are you want as much
customization as possible and the unique
thing that they've done with all the
gigabyte motherboards is they've made
the RGB headers RGB W compatible that
gives you a fourth connection point
they're actually a 5 pin header on there
so it is backwards compatible with the
standard RGB headers or RGB LED strips
but also gives the ability with that
fifth item for that fifth connection hi
Steve so you can add a white element or
you can add UV so cable mod for example
as well as a lot of other LED strip
manufacturers already have LED strips
that you can plug in that gives you that
fourth flavor I guess so you can add UV
or you can add white which is awesome
because when you try to do white with
RGB it always ends up having like a blue
tone to it and it's just not the
greatest so here's an example that they
have set up with a Z 270x gaming seven
and they've got cable mods
strips that are going through here and
it's also got this the sort of accent
panel there at the back that's one of
the other things
that they showed us here at the press
events was that they actually have
different versions of that available so
you can change them if you don't like
the design and I actually got a special
limited edition one that says CES 2017
on it that is only mine and no one else
can have because it's a limited special
edition it's mine
I couldn't leave here but talking about
this little device because Kyle and I
already kind of teased it a little bit
on the live show but this is called the
gigabyte desktop PC for lack of
apparently any other better name this is
the gaming GT series though and
basically what you have is a mostly
vertically oriented bare-bones unit so
you actually buy this without everything
that you need but it has to som slots in
there that you'll need to populate with
memory and I believe also you need to
add storage but other than that it's
actually a very powerful gaming PC and a
fairly small and svelte package it's got
integrated cooling so all that's taken
care of for you it's got a 6700 K
processor in there the full desktop
model on a mobile version and it's got a
full size gtx 1070 which is also pretty
cool now the unique thing is since it's
a bare-bones of course you're gonna be
able to open this up and get in there
and swap stuff out but they're trying to
make it a little bit more future ready
for possibly maybe new graphics cards
that maybe might come out in the future
we don't know anything about those but
it's got an integrated power supply but
it also comes with this little brick
here or this little brick is available
and you can actually remove a little
panel down here at the bottom and add
that brick in there and that actually
provides a little bit more power to the
motherboard so it allows it to read
rearrange the power configuration to
provide more power for potentially a
more power hungry graphics card than a
gtx 1070 and i'll leave that up to you
guys as speculation what that graphics
card might be now for i/o you have a
couple ports up front you also have more
ports available on the bottom so you've
got to go underneath there to get out
those but it does have USB 3.1 gen2
type-c connectors down there it also has
an active cooling system with these two
sort of leaf-shaped items on the top so
those will actually lift up
automatically based on the temperature
of the system inside so things get warm
they lift up let some hot air out and we
are just now getting an update on
availability for this it's coming next
month it will be available both in north
america and south america so if you're
looking for a pretty cool looking
small system that's still a full-powered
desktop gaming gaming PC VR ready - if I
didn't already mentioned check it out
this is the gigabyte desktop PC just
most generic name I've ever heard but
it's still it's still a cool cool
product so everyone keep your eye out
for it anyway that's all for my coverage
from here at the gigabytes suite or area
or whatever we're in and Caesars Palace
from Las Vegas Nevada thank you guys so
much for watching thank you again to my
sponsors a gigabyte of course as well as
Toshiba and deep cool and we'll see you
guys very soon more coverage of CES 2017
like like right now or probably later
