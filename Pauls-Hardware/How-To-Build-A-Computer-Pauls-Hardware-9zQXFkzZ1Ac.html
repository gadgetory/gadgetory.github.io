Paul's hardware I am very excited about
today's video because this is my first
ever full-blown how to build a PC
tutorial video for my personal YouTube
channel thank you guys so much for
tuning in today and for starters this is
how to build my personal system which is
right here it's uh cat 2011 that's
intel's enthusiast platform however
today's instructional video could also
easily apply to intel's mainstream
platforms such as ii 1150 or AMD's
platforms as well i wanted to start with
three good reasons why you might
consider building your own personal PC
the first is that it's really not that
difficult
most of the things you need to plug in
inside this system are keyed so you can
only plug them in one way and hopefully
this video will help you out as well the
second reason is that it's easy to
actually build a purpose-built system
for your specific needs so my needs
include video editing such as what I'm
probably doing right now also includes
some gaming because I do get that too
that every once in a while so I've built
the system with those two specific uses
in mind and that's why it shows a lot of
the hardware that I chose the third
reason is that if you build your own
system you're going to have the
confidence to go in make any necessary
repairs or upgrades that might come
along in the future just in case a part
might happen to fail or you need to add
more storage or more memory or anything
like that so hopefully those reasons
will give you guys a good excuse to go
out buy the necessary hardware and
assemble a computer just like this one
now this video is about just building a
desktop computer itself so if you're
using this as a guide bear in mind that
apart from the hardware shown here you
would also still need an operating
system to install like Windows 7 or
Windows 8 and peripherals like a mouse
keyboard and monitor to actually use the
computer so here are all of my parts a
CPU is a good place to start this is a
core i7 49 30 K which is one of Intel's
enthusiast processors this means that it
is more expensive but also very powerful
with six cores and a lot of bandwidth
for PCI Express devices and quad channel
memory I got this to help with video
editing and rendering on the top is a
silver heat spreader that protects the
die underneath and on the bottom are the
2011 gold contact
that you should be very careful not to
touch since it is an enthusiast CPU it
won't include a heatsink or fans so to
cool it I have the Swift tech h2 20 and
all-in-one liquid CPU cooler with a big
240 millimeter copper radiator this will
keep the CPU nice and chilly so I can
overclock my unlocked 4930 K the
motherboard is very important because
it's what everything plugs into I chose
the gigabyte x79 up4 because it has all
the features I need it socket 2011 so it
will work with my CPU it has the x79
chipset which will also work with my cpu
and as a bonus it has a nice sleek black
and gray color scheme the case is a
Corsair 760 T it will easily fit my ATX
motherboard and it has lots of room for
expansion cable management and storage
drives and it looks badass
and it has a big side window to show off
the finished build I'll probably end up
adding more storage over time but to
start off with I have a 480 gigabyte
Seagate 600 series SSD that I will be
installing Windows 7 onto and for mass
storage I have 2 4 terabyte WD black
series hard drives that I'll be setting
up in raid 1 that means the data will
automatically be written to both drives
so I have a backup just in case one
fails the memory is a 32 gigabyte
g.skill ripjaws II kit that's for 8
gigabyte sticks which means I can set
them up for quad channel performance 32
gigabytes is a lot of memory but it's
great to have for video editing and
these are rated to run at 2400 speed
which I'm pretty sure my CPU will be
able to handle the video card is an EVGA
geforce gtx 770 classified it is
overclocked and has 4 gigabytes of video
memory which will improve performance on
my higher resolution 2560 by 1600
monitor and it can be set up to work
with Adobe Premiere to help render video
effects it's not the fastest video card
available but I think it's a great bang
for the buck the power supply is a
carryover from my current system it's an
enter max plateau max 1200 watt unit
that is 80 + platinum rated the wattage
is admittedly overkill for this new
build but the Platinum efficiency rating
means I'll save on my electric bill it's
also fully modular although the cables
aren't the most aesthetically pleasing
in my opinion but I might Reese leave
them in a future update those are my
components so let's move on to tools and
some random accessories that I have
fortunately for most builds you can get
by with a standard Phillips head
screwdriver I like a magnetized tip one
so you can do this little trick to help
guide screws into their proper screw
holes of course I have a bunch of other
things like zip ties twist ties and
velcro straps for cable management these
black Rosewill cable extensions to
pretty up the power cables a bit and
thermal paste of course some other
screwdrivers and various sizes and my
sprayer bag of screws for some
unfathomable reason most computers can
have two types of screw threading one is
based on an imperial standard called UNC
6-30 -
and the other is m3 which is a metric
standard and I usually call that fine
thread it's usually not too difficult to
tell which one goes where but I like to
test out the vitally important
motherboard standoffs for each case
since I've encountered both types just
grab a screw and a stand up and make
sure they play nice together it is time
to start building so I've cleared my
work area and I have a rubber mouse mat
to protect the components also be sure
to purge yourself of static electricity
if you're like most people and you don't
have an anti-static wrist strap then
pull out your power supply first plug it
into the wall but don't turn it on and
touch the housing every so often while
you're building that will discharge
static electricity I'm going to start by
assembling the core components outside
of the case just to make sure everything
is working and I'm building on a handy
PCB blank with rubber standoffs but you
can use your motherboard box just don't
build on anything potentially conductive
like metal or the motherboards
anti-static bag after unpacking the CPU
I'm going to carefully open the CPU
socket on the motherboard by lifting the
two lever arms first is the one with the
u-bend push down and then out and away
from the socket and it will lift up
without too much trouble then do the
same to the lever with the v-shaped Bend
on the opposite side lifting it all the
way up push the u-shaped lever back down
onto the motherboard and the lid will
pop-up a little bit for you here you can
pop off the black plastic cover this is
an LG a socket which means the pins that
connect with the CPU or on the
motherboard side they are very very
delicate so be careful while the cover
is open grab the CPU remembering to hold
it by its edges and look for the small
golden triangle on one corner there's
also a triangle extra into the corner of
the socket on the motherboard just line
those up and with the gold contacts
facing down
lower the CPU on to the socket very very
carefully there are also four notches on
the top and bottom edges of the CPU that
will align with the socket once it's in
don't push down on it just give it a
very very light jiggle that will make
sure it's settled in the socket and then
close first the socket lid then the
v-shaped lever and then the u-shaped
lever noting that it might take a bit of
pressure to do so and hooray the CPU is
installed if you have a stock heatsink
fan for your CPU now would be a good
time to actually put it to some good use
I do happen to have one for LGA 2011 so
I'm going to install it temporarily for
the outside the case parts test apply
some thermal paste in the form of a
small pea-sized blob but right at the
center of the CPU heat spreader line up
the four mounting screws on the heatsink
fan lower the heat sink slowly onto the
CPU and let it settle so the thermal
paste will spread evenly tighten each
screw starting with opposite corners a
few turns at a time until they're all
snug don't forget to plug in the fan to
it connects to the four pin CPU fan
header next is memory note that I have
eight long DIMM slots on the motherboard
four on either side of the CPU and I'll
be populating four of eight of these
with my G skills but which slot should I
use well RTFM to find that information
it turns out it's the four grey slots so
tip of the hat to gigabyte here for the
color coding the memory sticks have a
notch in the middle that's just slightly
off-center so make sure you've got it
flipped the right way open the side
latches of each dim slot drop the memory
straight in and then apply firm even
pressure straight down on top of the
memory stick and it should snap into
place
closing the latches go ahead and do this
four times the video card will be next
it has a long PCI Express connector at
the bottom which also has a notch close
to the bracket this goes into the black
PCI Express slot that is closest to the
CPU and the graphics card should drop
into place without too much pressure try
not to bump it though because there's no
bracket to hold it in place at the
moment now we're ready to connect the
power and a monitor grab the power
supply cables needed here we'll need the
24 pin main motherboard connector the
eight pin supplemental CPU power
connector and the two eight pin PCI
Express power connectors for the gtx 770
remember that
there's a latch on one side of each plug
that will connect with a catch on the
motherboard connector and also don't mix
up those eight pins the ones for the
graphics cards are six plus two so line
those up first and then also keep the
graphics card supported while plugging
in the power finally I'll grab a monitor
plug it into the graphics card via DVI
in this case and turn on the power
supply but the motherboard doesn't have
an on/off button shoot that's okay just
locate the front panel connector pins
along the bottom edge of the motherboard
find the two that are labeled as power
pins here that the red ones and short
them for just a second by touching them
both with the tip of a screwdriver the
system should power on fans should spin
up and if all is well we have a
successful test boot with some BIOS
information appearing on the screen
don't worry if it tells you that there's
no boot device or something like that we
actually don't have a drive attached
right now so at this point you could
actually go ahead and connect up your
drives and install Windows but I'm going
to go ahead and build the rest of the
system in the case disconnect everything
from the test setup but leave the memory
installed as well as the CPU I'm going
to remove the CPU heatsink fan and clean
the thermal paste from the CPU heat
spreader to prepare for this with tech H
220 installation clear off your work
area grab the input/output shield for
your motherboard as well as nine screws
that will work with your case standoffs
bring the case on over open up the side
panels and lift them off and set them
aside somewhere safe just remember that
Plexiglas scratch is easier than Kyle
with a herpes outbreak lay the case on
its side and pop in the input/output
shield labels out and make sure that all
four corners are seated if it gives you
any trouble go ahead and give it a push
with the butt of your screwdriver and
that will usually help pop it into place
before you drop in the motherboard make
sure that all the cables are pushed
aside and that you have all of your
standoffs in place the nine that I need
came pre-installed in the 760 but double
check because a stand off in the wrong
place or no standoffs at all could cause
real damage the nine screws that you
used to secure the motherboard should be
snug but not too tight and that with
that we are one step closer I like to
plug in all my front panel connectors at
this point while the case isn't too
crowded this will enable the power and
reset buttons lights for power and drive
activity mic and headphone jacks and the
two USB 2.0 and USB 3.0 ports on the
front of the case the connection points
for the
these are mostly along the bottom edge
of the motherboard and labeled on the
board as well as in the manual these
connectors are keyed so for instance
even though USB 2.0 and HD audio are the
same size they can't necessarily be
swapped the 20 pin USB 3.0 plug is along
the right side of the motherboard and
the individual per pin plugs for the
power reset another front panel items
can be a real pain to work with so
reference the manual and remember you
only have to worry about positive and
negative markings with the LED plugs not
the power and reset hopefully you'll
only have to do this part once about
this time you can also plug in your case
fans to the 4 pin headers that aren't
labeled CPU fan I am skipping the cases
built-in fan controller in favor of
direct connection to the motherboard
I'll also be using the fan power
splitter provided with the H 220 and I
will tie up excess cables next to the
fan or tucked back behind the
motherboard tray I'm going to connect up
the black 8 pin CPU power extension now
because next up is going to be CPU
cooler installation and the rad from the
CPU cooler could potentially block
access to that plug I'll begin with the
radiator on top of the case I've already
swapped in my gentle typhoon fans I've
set it to push or send their up through
the radiator and I will just hold the
assembly from beneath and line up the 8
screws on top after getting a few in the
radiator it can support itself and then
I can finish off the rest in a lot of
cases I would need to worry about a
backplate on the motherboard for
installing the CPU water block and pump
but thankfully with Intel's enthusiast
platform there is one built in I'll just
be using these same principles from the
stock heatsink fan installation earlier
small pea-sized blob of thermal paste in
the middle lower the block on to spread
the thermal paste evenly start by
getting one corner screw threaded then
move to the opposite corner then tighten
each one a few turns at a time in
rotation I'm going to plug in my 24 pin
main power extension and get it routed
behind the motherboard and now the power
supply it sits at the bottom of the case
and I will point the fan down since
there is an intake and a filter right
below it and it's secured to the back
with four rough thread screws the
motherboard power cables that are
already connected can be fed back behind
the motherboard tray and plugged into
their respective extensions that I
already installed
and start to think now a little bit
about what cables are still needed so
you can plan out your cable management
the cables I still need to install are
three serial ata data cables for the
three drives and peripheral power cables
with some SATA power and 4-pin molex
connectors and that's for the three
drives as well as well as the fan hub
I'll install the WD hard drives with
these drive trays they just snap around
each side just make sure the four plugs
are set and the drive connector should
be on the opposite side of the thumb
grips slide them onto the drive rails
and I left a spot between them since
they can get warm while they're in use
and connect a SATA data cable and a SATA
power cable to each one the plugs are
l-shaped so don't flip them the wrong
way and then run the power cable over to
a power supply and the other ends of the
data cables will go to the SATA ports on
the motherboard the manual will reveal
once again which plugs work best the
native x79 ports are fastest but the
white ones here are six gigabits per
second and should be reserved for the
SSD the black ports are three gigabits
per second but also native on the x79
controller they'll work just fine for
the two four chair by WD drives after
sliding the SSD into place and
connecting it up with power and data as
well I can move on to the video card it
will be going in the top motherboard
slot and it will need two rear brackets
removed to make room for the video outs
feel free to use a screw driver on these
thumb screws they can be over tightened
from the factory remove the brackets and
then line up the video card to slot in
just like in the test build this time
you'll be able to secure it properly
with the two thumb screws that you just
removed and then move on to connecting
the last two power extensions for the
eight pin connectors on the video card
feed these back behind the motherboard
tray wire them up to the power supply
with the cables that we used in the test
build and then try your hand at
organizing the cables as best you can
I will be using twist ties velcro straps
zip ties in any combination and just
make sure that you minimize the overlap
particularly with thicker cables like
the main motherboard power connector and
you should be able to put the right side
panel back on without too much unsightly
bulging unless unsightly bulging is your
thing then go for it and you're now
finished with the build just plug in
that AC power flipped
switch and hit the power button the fans
will spin suddenly in the system burst
to life
LEDs shining forth radiantly to light
the path to hour upon hour of browsing
through cat pictures and the funny
subreddit the memory only just starting
to remember for the first time the hard
drives are fast catacombs waiting to
store backups of every half blurry
photograph you take of your dog or your
sashimi combo and the graphics card
hungers for pixels pixels ceaseless
bloody rampage the echoing screams of
the bank serenading their descent into
hell
sorry about that right the computer is
all finished I'm happy to say it's been
running great for me I've been using it
to do some Assassin's Creed Black Flag
gameplay trying to finish that one off
for you folks at home the next step
would be to install your operating
system I have a Windows 8 clean install
guy that you can check out on my youtube
channel i'll link that so you guys can
check it out and move on to the next
step that will also easily apply to
windows 7 if you're installing that
operating system i'm also going to be
doing some upgrades to this system in
the future so i'll be sure to do some
video content covering that i've also
got more build guides plan i have an HT
pc upgrade update coming very very soon
so don't forget to subscribe to my
youtube channel so you can be appraised
of all those videos once they become
available don't forget to like this
video because hopefully it has helped
you out and your pc building adventures
and i also spent a fair amount of time
on it so your likes are very very much
appreciated and they helped me out a lot
thank you guys so much for watching once
again we'll see you all next time
pixels to devour the ceaseless bloody
rampy without pixels pixels to devour
and a ceaseless bloody rampage with the
echoing screams of a vanquish serenading
the descent into hell pixels pixels to
devour the ceaseless bloody ravage the
echoing screams of the vanquished
serenading their descent into hell
pixels pixels to devour a ceaseless
bloody rampage with the echoing screams
of the vanquished serenading their
descent into hell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
