to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake alright guys I
meant not to and now and I have in my
hand one of the NF a 12 X 25 new fans
they have been developing for five years
and they just recently launched within
like last month or two it's a very
exciting launch but you guys probably
have already seen some different
demonstrations and some videos on this
actual fan who is actually showing some
specific and unique use cases for this
van if you're not just planning on
sticking them in a computer and they
also have some interesting other
products I think you guys might be
interested in so let's move on so first
off comes the practical demo and
basically they are working on a new Nhu
12 this is it right here it is a smaller
cooler than their NHD 15 because using
hundred and twenty millimeter fans daf-2
of them in push poll it's a seven heat
pipe configuration cooler and other than
that vertical airport but just with
really nice fans on top to prove its
worth they have a couple power supplies
set up here and those are feeding over
to some thermoelectric plates and
beneath each of these coolers in these
two acrylic cages this is not the most
scientific testing environment of course
but on the left you have an old eh 15 on
the right you have the new Nhu 12 and
basically they're cooling about 220
watts of heat outputs which is
equivalent to say a mainstream
overclocked CPU with the four to eight
cores or perhaps a high-end desktop with
even more cords than that depending on
the frequency and everything but as you
can see they're both cooling pretty much
the same they're both at about 49
degrees Celsius which means that the NHD
15 sucks now and as you get this one
true 9215 is still awesome but now
available and a much smaller more
compact size with better fans the 8 12 X
25 fans were in development for 5 years
and they have a unique material that the
fan blades are made of and they're very
fancy so they do cost a decent amount
they're about 30 US dollars or 30 euros
if you're in the EU but two of those
plus the cooler that's probably going to
be around 100 dollars which is about 10
bucks more than en HD 15 but you get
equivalent cooling and a more compact
size so now LGA 36:47 is Intel's Xeon
platform so I brought Jacob over here
because he was giving me an explanation
now recently Intel teased a 28 core 56
thread processor and I showed a video
where we actually got a look at the
platform you were able to see that it's
an LGA 36:47 motherboard and LGA 3647 is
a xeon platform it's it's made for
enterprise use and Jacob was explaining
to me installation of a CPU on that
platform because there has been some
skepticism if you guys saw the gamers
Nexus video there's some definite
skepticism as to if Intel is going to be
able to bring this product to market as
they have promised this year at least in
the form factor that they have
demonstrated here at Computex so Jacob
is going to real quickly give us an
explanation of how you install one of
these processors in LGA 36:47 yes as
Paul has said this socket has been
designed for an enterprise level system
assembly so it's very quick and
efficient for large volume system
integrators if you're in assembling
individual system things are a little
bit more tricky and there are a couple
of things you need to take care of first
of all you'll have to clip the CPU into
this until positive processor clip and
you'll have to make extra sure that
these little and plastic yeah just
firmly snap on to your CPU and that the
clip is really fully snapped onto the
CPU because the next step that you have
to do is put the CPU with the clip onto
your cooler snap it onto the cool
we'll actually latch to the mounting
parts you can see here and once this is
done you will put the whole thing on to
the motherboard
and fix it with four screws now that
sounds pretty straightforward but at
that point you will really have to make
double sure that the CPU is firmly
snapped to the processor clip because
otherwise you have the risk that the CPU
could fall down and fall into the socket
which could damage the socket and as the
LGA 36:47 motherboards tend to be very
expensive this is something you would
want to avoid at all costs because
damaging pins on a three four hundred
dollar plus motherboard it's not a good
time and a company like Intel would want
to make sure that they are at least
making an attempt to minimize our amazed
and returns for that kind of experience
snapping when thread Ripper came out
with the tr4 socket I was pretty excited
because it was a little bit more of an
advanced installation method there's a
few details you need to pay attention
but in this case you're actually
clipping the processor to the cooling
solution and then dropping it into the
socket and it just seems like there
might be some potential for end-users to
damage it so possibly not the most
user-friendly solution so I still hope
that Intel comes out with the 28 core
processor as they have promised but will
it be on this exact platform we're not
really sure hopefully there's more
details soon that's a good that's a good
answer
here's another practical application of
the nf8 12 X 25 it's a desk fan this is
just a 3d printed mock-up that they've
made but I can tell you you can stand a
good six to eight feet away from this
thing and you still get a pretty intense
blast of air from it thanks of course
the effectiveness of the fan but also
the design of this unit right here
they're using the venturi effect to help
pull additional air into the airstream
by virtue of the vacuums that are
naturally created between there so even
if I have my finger back here I can
still feel airflow being pulled through
this unit they are planning and working
with the design team to make a finished
product of this that looks a bit more
or a desktop use but for now I want to
steal this and bring it home because I
need a nice quiet desk fan and this
seems like a good one moving over to the
prototype section when the NFA 12 X 25
came out of first Noctua was instantly a
school is there going to be a 140
millimeter version of that we need a
larger one too
yes they're working on it it is a
completely different design process they
can't just scale up the 12 centimeter
one to 14 centimeters but at least in
the meantime they have some next-gen
d-type coolers so they like the D 15
they're working on two different
versions one with two thin stacks one
with a single thin stack according to
Noctua these are pretty much equivalent
in performance so far so once they get
this figured out they will probably
launch this I'm not gonna make any
promises as to when that will happen
though because you guys you guys know
how not to it does it they don't watch
it till it's ready speaking of the 14
centimeter version of the a 12 X 25
here's the 12 centimeter version here is
their existing mock-up of the 14
centimeter version as you can clearly
see if it is clear in the prototype
stage so hopefully it won't take five
whole years to develop like this one
since they have perfected the material
in here but maybe next year sometime
here's some products that were teased
last year that were actually expecting
to launch next month these are basically
5 volt versions of their 12 volt fans so
140 millimeters 200 millimeter as well
as the 120 millimeter and these since
they're 5 volt can be converted with a
simple adapter to USB so you can just
plug them in via a USB run them off a
power bank or run them off with a USB
port in your computer just a more
convenient way to connect these up and
we're expecting these to launch in June
since October fans are so good people
often take existing products that have
other fans integrated for cooling
purposes and and Noctua fans to them
it's just a demo they have because this
Russa f3 MK 3 3d printer and this is the
actual printer unit here needs to stay
cool and they had so many people
swapping out this little nook to a fan
in there that they have now adopted it
and they're just shipping it with the
Noctua fan install this product I think
a very niche group of my fans will be
interested in it is the sensor wake
olfactory alarm clock so it's an alarm
clock you put perfume packs in there or
or smell packs there's this various
varieties that could go and they're 11
different scents espresso chocolate
peppermint and orange juice and then it
wakes you up with a smell but it doesn't
want to wake you up with the sound of an
annoying fan so they're using a knock to
a fan there in the back to deliver smell
to you to wake you up in the morning
does anyone want this product I'm I
don't know I'm kind of interested I
don't know if I could be woke up by a
snow maybe I'll maybe I'll get one of
these to test out in the future though
moving up just a few more products to
share here this is in development but
should be out later this year from the
Redux line this is an NH ute well sort
of a redesign of this product is still
still using the NFL fan on there but
it's available in the Redux colors of
sort of a lighter and darker gray tower
style air cooler with four heat pipes so
the cooling isn't going to be great play
is crazy good as some of their hiring
force but this one's only going to cost
about 40 bucks and also considering some
top plates on there to keep things
looking pretty and they even have a
bracket that could go across the top
potentially so a similar setup to their
chrome axe line I mentioned 3d printing
earlier this is a device that
specifically made to help 3d printer
users which often apparently I don't
know because I don't use graphing but
they often run a 24 volt system so this
is just say 24 volt to 12 volts DC to DC
step-down converter
just put that in line with your fan and
you can run here not to a fan in a 24
volt environment and finally some new
chrome axe products and I'm actually
really excited about these here because
for Mac's before you had to sort of buy
the existing not to a cooler and then
buy the chrome axe products to go on top
of it if you wanted things to be pretty
and blend in but they're not working on
all black versions of the NHD 15 as well
as the Nhu 12s even the little NHL mine
I
low profile cooler is down there as well
all black doubts with black fans and for
anyone who's concerned about aesthetics
in their build and can't quite get the
color scheme to match right with the
traditional black to brown and tan
colour scheme even the tooling that they
have for these is all black so I think
these products are going to be pretty
popular and they're only expecting them
to be maybe a few bucks more than the
existing versions and you get all the
chrome X setup altogether you don't have
to buy it individually okay guys that's
gonna wrap it up for my coverage here at
the enough to a boost copy text 2018 I'd
like to of course say a big thank you to
my sponsors for this event thermaltake
Coolermaster gigabytes team group it's
also thanks to you guys watching and the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video maybe subscribe to because they
have more Computex videos coming at you
real soon
see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
