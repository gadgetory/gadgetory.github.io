what's up guys how's it going welcome to
pauls hardware today's video is gonna be
a little bit different than my typical
videos because i have a new product here
it's from yamaha it is the mg 10 xu and
it's basically a soundboard I've gotten
this device for a very specific reason
and that is because of Kyle that's right
hashtag blame Kyle whenever we're doing
a live show here things can get a little
loud sometimes we drink a few beers and
that kind of thing and people have
constantly been telling me you need to
add a compressor so there's software
solutions for that I looked into those
and I basically decided you know what a
soundboard upgrade would probably do me
good right now so I ended up getting
this it's got a compressor built into it
I'm gonna be doing an unboxing and have
a little bit of brief testing today but
please bear in mind I am by no means an
audiophile I'm by no means a
professional when it comes to analyzing
this type of product so just wanted to
have some fun and take you guys along
for the ride see how things go
so here goes starting off with an
unboxing in just a moment but I also
wanted to give a quick plug and this is
not paid for or endorsed at all by sweet
water I bought this directly from them
and they sent me a big old book of the
crowd exhibition I'm probably not gonna
be used to be honest but look they sent
me candy there's a sweet sweet water and
that seems to be sweet water and primo
Jill good job sending candy along with
the products that go in there as well as
a thank you and everything so again this
is my first experience to sweet water
they actually called me after I place
the order which I thought was a little
weird but they seem like really nice
people and if you don't want to feed the
Amazon beast then maybe check Sweetwater
heavier than the other one so you know
something's high quality like power
supplies some sad words and they're
heavy
all right well there's the unboxing
there wasn't a whole lot as for I mean
you know styrofoam packaging big old
power brick with the looks like a BNC
connector I like that I'm a big fan of
BNC connectors that's a plug into that
that's that feels more professional and
I like that the brick isn't like part of
the plug that's convenient too I guess
all right sound board itself is right
there
this is an 8 channel board it's got four
powered XLR inputs with phantom power
and that's got a bunch of extra
quarter-inch inputs it's also got XLR
for stereo output and then these yellow
knobs right here are the one knob
compressor functions so rather than me
continuing to speak as if I know a lot
of the details and ins and outs of the
sound board like this wait I do know
some things these are equalizers you can
do speaking equalizer out there and it's
got a bunch of effects also built in and
they're all labeled right there so we
might be testing some of those as so I
think what I should do here is learn by
doing and we'll take this microphone
which is an ADK Audio deutsch craft a 51
type 3 class a solid-state I believe
this is a condenser mic II I'm not
mistaken and actually Joe had this and
he offered it to me
a while ago and I've done nothing with
it so we're gonna test it out right now
all right I'm recording on the zoom h6
now too so that you can hear what I'm
saying into the microphone
no cussing Joe yeah sorry sorry sorry
Joe what Joe in the future
so guys I think we've gotten this basic
setup going on right now I apologize I
do not have a proper shockmount for this
microphone which is really not the way I
should be working it also I'm listening
to myself talk which is sounds kind of
awkward although it sounds it sounds
pretty nice one of the reasons I wanted
to get this soundboard here's because my
assumption is that it since it costs
more money the internal and the quality
of the internals as far as the DAX is
going to be better and I know that's
just an assumption but I mean I'm going
from a monoprice unit that costs maybe
70 or 80 bucks to this unit which is
around 200 I also need to correct myself
this is a 10 channel unit not an 8
channel I confused myself because I was
looking at a bunch of them online and
ended up going with this one largely due
to the fact again that it's got a
compressor now compressor is gonna limit
the sound output when things get really
loud to put it simply and that is a
problem that Kyle seems to have when he
comes over and has a few drinks is that
he goes from being like yeah that's what
Kyle sounds like what happens when you
turn the compressor all the way up we
now have maximum compression max
compression does it sound anything I
have no idea
Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday awesome hardware
live from Southern California with beer
technology as well as Kyle so just to
give a little bit further demonstration
here at Joe brought his guitar over he's
left-handed that's why he's playing at
me also he's much better guitar than I
am so basically we've got the guitar
wired in through the quarter inch
there's a foot switch option in here
like I said there's all these different
effects and stuff to play with
and then I'm recording what Joe is
playing on separately on the age or the
age of six over here just so we have
that going too
I'm gonna pretend like I can hear the
special effects and stuff like that
so far this is course one
most worse oh yeah there's like a little
switch here you can like select the
effects which is pretty cool you push
down to like select it okay then I
believe you can
you can also individually control the
level of the effects yeah can increase
or decrease it this is zero
yes 10
dude can you sing a nothing can try just
bring myself up here a little bit a
little bit
pretty bad all right am I am i coming
through now - yeah
okay my loud enough can you hear me well
I scream bloody murder that's true okay
a week shake dreams from your hair and
my pretty child my sweet she was your
day choose the sign of the day the day's
divinity first thing you see
that's the dories Beverly the other cool
thing I'm kind of thinking might be fun
to try out is using the effects on the
vocals is there okay all right so so I
can add oh oh well now it sounds like
I'm in a very small but equity room it's
that's an interesting effect oh yeah oh
yeah this is what we're gonna use to
introduce the live show from now on
you're watching awesome hardware you've
come to supply your soul to the gods of
Technology haven't consumed ours
oh that's gonna be so much fun Oh radio
voice what's that radio voice this
reminds me of like the Hindenburg thing
there's the compressor the compressor
doing its job I think that there's also
two knobs for compression so I can use
one on Kyle and want to be super
convenient
alright enough with the effort the radio
voice okay guys we're having way too
much fun but here's one last audio
comparison and this is completely
invalid and means nothing because it's a
completely different mic being used here
versus up here but here is me talking on
this new setup with this ADK microphone
how's it sound pretty good
and now here's me on the old audio setup
which is probably crappy and
insufficient now because it's old and
therefore must be crappy whereas new
stuff must be better it's how we
validate our purchases but anyway thank
you for sticking with us through this
video I know it's been a little bit
random a little off-the-cuff
a little bit different from the norm but
I hope you guys have appreciated it and
enjoyed it to some degree at least and
of course your feedback is very much
required down in the comments section
below
let me know what you think of this video
let me know if you'd like to see more
randomness when I get new stuff in just
like pull it out of the box give it a
shot see how it works
hit the thumbs up and of course if you
enjoyed this video as well thank you
very much to Joe for being here helping
filming and also by serenading us with
his guitar skills and thanks to all you
guys for watching as well we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
