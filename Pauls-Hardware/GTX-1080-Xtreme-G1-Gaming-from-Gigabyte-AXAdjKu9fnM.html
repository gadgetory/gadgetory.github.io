sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill what's up guys welcome to
Computex 2016 coverage in we're at the
gigabytes suite
we're actually Taipei 101 on the 36th
floor and we're starting off with the
look at the designee Ruiz this is a new
series of motherboards from gigabyte and
basically they're aiming these that
content creationists and people who
wants to do a little bit more with their
system than typical just gaming we have
the Ultra Series as well we're gonna
take a look at in a second that is more
geared towards gaming specifically but
these all have sort of a blue and black
aesthetic which is pretty nice we also
have several of them that have our GB
LEDs so this one has RGB this one as RGB
they're calling it ambient surround LED
because RGB LEDs is it's just too boring
also this board right here is probably
the one that I'm most interested in all
of these are z170 boards that could be
used with the existing skylake
processors this is the x99 does it
designate X and I believe I will be
doing a review on this one in the future
it not only has like a PCIe gen3 by 4 by
32 speed slot right here it's also got a
couple you two ports also got you know
the steel-reinforced up on the memory
slots as well as on the PCIe slots and
they've done something very special with
this board which is to add a plx bridge
because you know if you're dropping a
Broadwell ii CPU in here that's 40 PCI
Express gen3 lanes this is just not
quite enough for some people that means
that they can do stuff like doing the -
you - and the PCIe nvme gen 3 connection
right there and giving you support for
multiple graphics cards also a little
added bonus is that if you're using a 28
Lane CPU such as the 68 20k I hope I
have that their new CPUs I don't have
all that memorized so far but if using a
28 Lane CPU you can actually get a
little bit more connectivity thanks to
the added PCIe lanes that you via that
plx bridge switch now a lot of these
boards are also featuring Thunderbolt 3
and if you're not excited about
Thunderbolt 3 let's see if we can get
you excited about Thunderbolt 3 let's
look over here right here we have a
variety of Thunderbolt 3 accessories
Thunderbolt 3 gives you 40 gigabits per
second bi-directional man
it can be used for connecting displays
external storage and some of these
devices they have here I was pretty
impressed with like this one it's just a
bunch of USB ports right but they're all
USB 3.1 ports type a and type C they
told us they were doing a demos having
this setup and they had all eight
devices connected doing 350 megabytes
per second on each one at the same time
that's pretty badass the one that I was
pretty stoked on here though Kyle as
well since again we make videos there's
something external so if you have either
a desktop PC that you have tucked away
somewhere maybe giving you more
accessible ports or maybe a laptop that
you just want to bring home plug in some
Thunderbolt and give yourself some
goodness SD card reader USB type 3 and
3.1 and USB I'm sorry
a and C trim you got a mic and headphone
jack
we got Ethernet on the back you got more
USB look at all the USB ports on this
you even got to display pastors for
DisplayPort and HDMI even got a ps2 port
on there and on the bottom there's
another slot where you can just drop in
and then that two PCIe SSD so you could
have like storage here and all this
connectivity I think that's pretty
badass for you guys who maybe don't want
to go with the blue aesthetic we got the
Ultra Series over here so these are more
geared towards gamers and how do we know
that geared towards gamers while all of
these have the RGB LEDs because gamers
love RGB LEDs if you don't fall into
that stereotype don't worry they still
have fantastic features aside from that
again we got x99 phoenix sli so this one
of course is gonna be compatible through
Rodwell e same with here x9 in an ultra
gaming red and orange depending on your
preference
I've also got some red options down here
both in the z1 70 MB 150 trim so again
lots of fantastic features for these
probably too much for me to go over
right now but these are a bit more
geared towards overclocking and
especially connectivity for external
devices of course you still got u2 to
support as well as m dot 2 and again and
you got these RGB LEDs and not just on
the sides of them but you got these
little trails that go up between the
memory slot
actually looks pretty cool so we're
still a gigabyte it might not look like
it but we have actually come downstairs
because whereas upstairs they had some
cool demonstrations going on with this
new 1080 graphics cards with the new
1080 graphics cards in systems we had to
come down here to actually physically
handle them as I am doing right now so
this first off is the GTX 1080 g1 gaming
from gigabyte which is going to be of
course quite high ends but perhaps a
little bit more for you standard video
card lovers out there it's got your
typical 1080 power delivery with an 8
pin power connector three fans sort of
the traditional gigabyte style of triple
fan cooling and if history is any lesson
this should provide excellent cooling
perhaps tame some of the thermals from
the GTX 980 that we've seen so far
comes with the backplate of course and
standard IO configurations so that was a
g1 gaming oh I should also mention that
the it's got RGB LEDs here as well as a
fan stop mode a little light up it'll
light up them also hopefully I'm not
gonna drop it break it and it's got
orange accents on there as well now the
sort of more exciting one here which I'm
gonna request the Kyle come in and sort
of hold for me is if that's okay with
you Kyle Thank You Kyle all right so
this is the extreme gaming version of
the GTX 1080 and this one's pretty fancy
first off of course you still has RGB
lights it does have some orange accents
on there as well the extreme gaming logo
will light up here as well as that cross
that's over the fans in the middle
speaking of the fans in the middle they
look a little weird don't they look at
that Center one there it's kind of set
under they overlap each other and it's
got like smaller blades and bigger
blades and and it's just it's kind of
cool-looking and we have to assume that
with those fans they wouldn't have done
that unless it provided some sort of
benefit right or maybe it looks really
cool obviously we can't tell you from
our own experience until we actually get
this card to test but it's definitely a
very beefy cooler it's definitely gonna
be three slots it's pretty wide but it
also has a couple other cool features
apart from a backplate it also has
double the power delivery so two to
eight pin peg connectors on there so
basically gives you not double but
almost double the power that the 1080
would get by default and then look down
in this end what's that
there's internal HDMI headers what so
gigabytes going to sell this with the
special kits that will come with front
panel connector
I'm sorry front panel Bay insert screwed
about three and a half as well as five
and a quarter inch not allow you to get
HDMI from the card internally in your
system pipe that through the front of
your system and then it for you vir
junkies out there you probably see where
I'm going that will allow you to connect
your VR up to the front of your system
which might be a little bit easier
especially if you're done you know
unplugging and plugging it back in when
you're not using it of that kind of
thing
pretty cool little feature on there so
anyway this is the extreme gaming GTX
1080 from gigabytes Thank You Kyle for
your lovely hand modeling oh one last
thing before I go to finish off this
gigabyte video upstairs there is a
plethora a really really cool modded
system so I'm gonna leave you guys with
a bit of a montage of the gigabytes
modded system table with all the mounted
systems on it enjoy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
