hardware I am very excited because there
is a big old pile Hardware here in front
of me which means it is of course time
for yet another bill actually my first
build of 2017 so I'm pretty excited here
this is a cave you like build it's
full-size ATX and it's also RGB I'm
calling this a classy RGB build because
you have the ability to turn all the RGB
lights up if you want to which means you
can go for single color and change that
or if you want to go crazy with the RGB
you can do that as well I'm liking the
newer family of RGB products again
because they're usually like a neutral
color scheme like the the asus
motherboard and graphics card that we
have there and then the software has
come a long way so we're going to be
using AC sapporo software that will be
in the follow up video where i do
testing on this which should be out in
hopefully week or so i am waiting on one
final product for that part but more on
that in a second let's go over all of
these parts individually starting with
cpu which if you didn't already notice
is going to be an intel we still don't
have AMD processors from zen yet know
rise in cpu so stick with a with intel
for now this is a 7700 k highest end
chip in the mainstream series from the
kb lake newly launched set of kb lake
processors the case is going to be the
end to evolve from fantex which is right
here this is a tempered glass side panel
version and it's in the satin black
finish fantex also sent over a couple of
just basically RGB LED strips here so i
can add them to the connection and at
what the goal here the idea is that the
motherboard over here has RGB headers on
it so i should be able to wear those up
to the case and i should be able to wire
those up to the internal led's so all
control will be of the same software now
for storage I have some persevere from
OCZ I have a really fast M to drive the
Rd 400 there this is also very expensive
so bear that in mind it's a one terabyte
version of the m dot 2 nvme drive again
super fast but pretty expensive so maybe
not as practical only consider this if
you really need the speed if you're
doing like lots of video editing or
something like that or if you just need
some really fast
do you like evans a stuff i have a much
more reasonably priced for an 80 gig to
achieve a drive through the TR 150 this
one you can get for round
20 dollars or so I believe and that's
again much more reasonable
so maybe just get two of these or
something if you don't want to get this
one for a cooler for the seat to you
since I actually don't have a CPU cooler
and this is the unlocked case q70 700k
so you do need an aftermarket cooler
it's on its side but at the NZXT kraken
X 62
this one has RGB LEDs in it as well but
this is the only product that isn't
going to tie in as far as I know with
Ora sweet so I'm going to maybe need to
use the NZXT cam software to control
that one but to my knowledge there's no
RGB LED CPU coolers that work with Ora
software yet probably soon but I'm not
not right now here's the memory this is
a g-scale tried at Z set and again this
is temporary because I'm getting the
g.skill I believe it's still tried at
the RGB version that has RGB LEDs going
across the top so this will be a
placeholder for now but it will get the
job done and allow me to at least get
the system up and running and then of
course our motherboard and graphics are
both from Asus the Maximus 9 hero I
think a very full-featured and yet more
reasonably priced member of the rog
series of motherboards from asus and
also these Strix GT X 1080 this is the
overclocked version and again both of
those are going to have our DV LEDs and
work with the Ora software and all that
good stuff oh I almost forgot I almost
forgot to the power supply up C on the
top EVGA supernova 750g - this was one
that I can have already had on hand and
it's got all black cabling 700 Watts 80
plus gold it's again it's going to get
the top job done just fine and I may or
may not be getting some sleeving for it
some sleeves cables or maybe some
extensions again if I do that I'll do it
for the the second follow-up video for
this where I do testing anyway I am just
super excited to put this all together
so I'm going to set up some cameras and
get some good footage for you guys and
and I hope it turns out good wish me
luck
here goes
you
so I've just reinforced a very important
lesson if you guys have been watching
hopefully something like I got
everything completed tempered glass eye
panels on even went to peel peel the
plastic off there and that's very
satisfying end of the build process
however I've said the past before you
shouldn't put the sides handle on before
you power the system on because of
course there is a an ancient curse that
applies to all pcs that are built but if
you do that you will bring pain and
misfortune upon yourself and your family
I mastered it in a way that I have never
managed to do before and that is when
the system went on I discovered this yes
friends at some point in this build
process early on when I install the
motherboard I basically took the
pre-wired cable from this case fan and
wedged it between the clear CMOS button
and IO shield meaning the clear CMOS
button is depressed is pressed down
meaning the system will not power on at
all meaning I need to pretty much remove
the motherboard or at least get it to
Moot to shift to get that out of there
which is like practically a rebuilt it's
not like a rebuild I don't know how
let's see how quickly I can fix this but
anyway that's going to require me to at
least remove the motherboard or at least
shift it in order to get that out of
there which means I'm going to need some
undo a lot of the stuff that done with
this build and it's going to suck but
anyway I better fix this ASAP and I'll
be back once it is fixed and the system
powers on alright so here it is this
little cable right here and I've managed
to fix it or get it cleared out of the
space it was wedged into thank God I
didn't have to remove the motherboard
but I did have to pull the graphics card
out I removed all nine screws and I
lifted the board up just like shifted
away from the i/o shield a little bit
then I was able to get the screwdriver
done and I can't pull it off to the side
and then by accessing from the rear
panel I pulled it out all the way okay
problem solved moving on so here it is
everybody the build in its present state
and you can probably hear it it's pretty
loud right now the fans are running at
full speed so it's noisy but before I
turn it off so you can hear me better I
do want to point out the
the kits that sent excess over which is
right here it's just for connecting up
their RGB strips as well as the RGB
elements on this case which are the
accent up at the top right there there's
also a little bar across the front does
seem to have worked it's got a kind of a
loopback thing that you do if we add
connects it doesn't seem like it would
work at first but they're lighting up
and it even lets you pass through and
still power these these LED strips that
are magnetic that I've kind of stuck in
there temporarily for now so good that
all that worked and and yeah it's
functional but it's not displaying the
same colors right now that the
motherboard showing I think I need to
get into the software and update that
and that way I can actually control
everything individually but I do not
have time for today's video to load
windows and get the software up and
running I'm going to need to cut this
video a little bit short I wants a short
but I would normally give you some
sexier b-roll shots of this and
everything at the end but I just don't
think it's quite in that state
especially without the RGB s up and
running properly as they should be so
let me power this off for a sec and
let's quickly go over a few of the other
things I really like this case I have
liked it for a while and this my first
time actually building it I love the way
the panel's pop off like you they just
pop out of there and then they fit bag
in its got dust filtration for the
entire front and the bottom which is
nice and just it's pretty well built it
doesn't have quite the like enthu Pro
had a lot of features in my mine but the
build quality wasn't there this one
seems like it built a bit better and I
like that they've got like some some
pads going on here for descending or for
the tempered glass side panels and
everything some things that I'm going to
change an update for the second
follow-up video because I do have
another video coming up on this build
and I will give you guys 63 year old in
with the RGB is working I promise
definitely I definitely need to clean up
the cable management down there in the
basement the basement usually you can
just shove it in there it doesn't matter
but here it does because you've got
tempered glass on both sides and you can
see right through that there because I
removed this front piece here because I
put the radiator for the NZXT creaking
cracking X 62 up in front here
and pulling in I mainly did that because
I felt like there was there was enough
clearance I could if it is in the top up
there but I wanted the memory to be able
to stand out and it was really bumping
up right up against it up here with the
van and there and the radiator on the
top so when I do switch out that memory
I want it to not look like it's crowded
or anything let me know what I think I
should do about this tubing for the
krey-kin because originally it was
hanging a little bit looser and dropping
down and covering the RGV logo on this
graphics card which is terrible you
can't do that so right now I have it
just kind of velcro up there with a loop
of it to kind of keep it up to the side
but I feel like there's a better
solution for that possibly let me know
how badly you think these look the NZXT
fans facing inwards with the upside down
logos I think it's okay I'm on the
inside of those and then of course going
to be swapping out that g.skill memory
and I think that's about it the only
other thing that I was considering is
possibly some extensions or sleeves
cables for the EVGA power spot oh yeah
the EVGA press place so please cables
maybe I might actually I know EVGA makes
them directly for their power supplies
although I don't know I think they're
pretty decent quality so maybe I'll
maybe I'll see if they want to send some
of those over for the 24 pin as well as
the these are the most visible ones for
the graphics card they then also the
EVGA logo on the power supply I've left
it on for now because I don't think it
stands out too badly but let me also
know in the comments if you think I
should peel that off because you know
killing that off is all the rage and
that's what we all often recommend into
my PC on awesome hardware anyway that
guys thanks again for watching this
video I hope you have enjoyed it it's
been quite a long build made namely
mainly that thing that happened this the
cable in the back and the clear CMOS
that that's really threw me for a loop
that was weird and random but anyway hit
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video and I will be back very soon
probably give me a week so we can have
to get the follow up video on this out
because the memory from G feels Dawn's
way and I need to wait for that to right
before I do everything else but I do
have more videos coming up this week
stay tuned thanks for watching click on
links down a description up with links
to all the parts to use and all that
good stuff and we'll see you later
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
