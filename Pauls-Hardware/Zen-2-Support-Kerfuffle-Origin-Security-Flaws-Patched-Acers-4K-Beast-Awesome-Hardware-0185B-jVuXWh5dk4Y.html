about be life yay hi everyone how's it
goin and welcome to awesome hardware
that's it
this is episode number 185 live show we
dream in live right now to youtube and
twitch TV we discuss technology
computers other random stuff stream
every Tuesday night at 5:30 p.m. to
civic time and you can watch the entire
show on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
or you can watch on youtube where the
show is split in half because I
collaborate with my friend Kyle here
who's channels called bit wit we just
finished the first tab it's on his
channel so check that out if you missed
it if you're watching live thank you so
much for being here we love you guys
yeah we're gonna talk about a few things
on my half of the show including some
some Zen some Zen to rumors that were
kind of bouncing around this week that
we want to kind of debunk or maybe just
provides more information on EA's origin
client had a security security flaw that
was exposed that you guys will probably
want to update Facebook sucks still and
Easter has a really cool new monitor so
beautiful will also be following up with
the after party after this that's linked
in the description and we'll be
answering donation comments that have
come in and maybe playing some video
games in the meantime a quick word of
warning we do occasionally use adult
language on the show and we also have a
beer so cover your ears if you don't
like adult language I'm Laura Cheers so
those of you who are joining us and can
drink responsibly if you have age of
course should I bust out the stouts yes
how about sets we're just finishing up
this delirium tremens which is
absolutely delicious and yeah while Kyle
is grabbing some more beer let's quickly
plug the stores my store is pulsar
Burnett if you want to help support our
channels then you can shop on our stores
we are merchandise is real high-quality
it's all supported by our good friend
John who handles our stores I have a new
captive thumbscrew shirt design which is
insanely popular look at that it's thumb
screw
I saw jail ariana grande wearing this
last week that cows got one right there
you can be live just like her special
dye from like foreign countries that
sets into the fabric and breathe which
is glorious so guys check it out if
you're interested
pulsar brunette for my store bit with
that tech slash store for cow store he
also has a new design screw with
confidence which we should all we should
all do we should all be confident doing
that it's it's a good PSA it's a good
reminder that's true
everyone around you should should know
available in grey or green check it out
I got a couple of these but they're in
the wash so I'll wear one next week wash
also we have awesome hardware merch that
supports both of us order from either
store we split the proceeds we greatly
appreciate your support and that is all
I have to say about that's beautiful
let's move into some additional tech
news I'm ready for this so this was this
is bouncing around it for the past day
or two and actually followed up with
them aside today to get the straight
poop
oh nice as it were that's investigative
journalism I know I was I felt very
journalistic who speaking of journalists
techpowerup had the original article on
this and if I may be a little critical
here I felt please do it this was not
perhaps not handled the best by
techpowerup this is comment' to be
constructive criticism we do techpowerup
stuff all the time they have a great
website but just just looking at this is
the original article posted yesterday
April 15th msi betrays AMD socket a.m.
for longevity promise no zen to for 300
series before we read any of the texas
article let's look at the source here
this comes from reddit and it was posted
on reddit by master three five five
three because the redditor I believe is
sourced in Germany and this appears to
be MSI's German tech support responding
he asked them if they would be
supporting the next generation of rising
processors Zen two is what they're based
on Rison 3000 series is what the
processors will be called and the answer
from tech support was basically no and
that led to a bunch of people being like
Spiral
what the hell yeah now he posted this on
reddit and that's where it got picked up
and published by other other other
sources of news such as tech power up I
just felt like this was not handled the
best then I mean look at the first line
here
greedy motherboard vendors such as MSI
want you to buy a new motherboard every
two generations of processor for no
sound reason at all no accusatory no
right okay note that he gets through the
entire first paragraph as well as most
of the second before even pointing out
where the source comes from it's such a
bold first statement for a random reddit
post yeah for a random reddit post from
a random tech support guy we've all seen
we've had countless stories on this show
before where a tech support rep just got
the info wrong and then the company had
to come in and say that's not that's not
know don't know and yet this like it's a
very accusatory post for just some
little bit of evidence this right here
should have been the first line of the
article from at least from what I know
yeah headline which is the source right
because anyone who's reading this
article is hopefully going to sort of
reality check all right this is a reddit
post a single tech support response yeah
anyway so this article talks about these
those of the of where this information
actually came from support email to an
ex 370 X power titanium owner which is
MSI higher-end motherboard MSI tech
support confirming supposedly that they
will not be extending Zen to support to
AMD 300 series a representative of
another motherboard vendor and this is
from tech power up they said that they
contacted another motherboard vendor on
condition of anonymity who told them
that Zandu processors have a steeper
have steeper electrical requirements
than 300 series motherboards or that
some 300 series motherboards don't meet
that's valid sure that's yes that's a
physical limitation we do that damage we
do not know the answer to this question
right now right it's worth debating yeah
I just feel like this article was
was a little hot little poorly phrase
especially when you consider that this
article has now been followed up by
another article today MSI's
clarification because they issued a
press release now in the original
article you'll note that the writer of
the article bt a runner did update down
here at the bottom update 1604 ms i
posted a clarification on this issue but
who's gonna read that little bit you'll
note that there's no update indicated up
further up in the article to the top of
the article all I'm saying is we want as
much information as we can about this
and I feel like they were not being
quite as direct with it as possible now
MSI has issued a press release sort of
dealing with this and I have I believe
and there's my screen cap of it that I
pulled from my email so there it is I
may need to try to make this smaller
that's not gonna get smaller okay so
loud and clear we will support it no and
that's it's not a direct answer that's
why oh no that's why I wanted to read
this right here so we could hopefully
get a little bit more information it's
come to our attention that MSI customer
supporters we got I believe misinformed
and MSI customer with regards to
potential support for next-gen AMD CPUs
on the X 370 X bar gaming titanium the
motherboard through the state we want to
clarify this current situation at this
point we are still performing extensive
testing on our existing lineup of 300
and 400 series and four motherboards to
verify potential compatibility for the
next-gen AMD Rison CPUs to be clear our
intention is to offer maximum
compatibility for as many MSI products
as possible that's good that's good
doesn't mean that's also not a being
that's not a that's not a statement of
commitment they're saying we're gonna do
as much as we can right to make sure we
have as much compatibility as we can
yeah for this entire range of processors
not a guarantee but now knowing what we
know about the developments of hardware
and and and the and in the PC space it's
it's there's a lot of steps that go into
bringing hardware to the market yeah so
to me this is MSI hedging a little bit
to make sure that if there are high-end
am4 CPUs Rison 3000
use that do require newer motherboards
for whatever reason right whether it's
because they're just being crappy and
trying to convince you to buy new
motherboards sure or whether it's
because there's actual electrical power
delivery requirements or that otherwise
from jumping from an eight-core 16
thread CPU to a 16 core 32 thread CPU
until they're the same thing that's
available on this platform when they
went to eight core and in so it gets a
lot of flack for it sure this is one of
AMD's sort of selling points yeah and
when they came out with a m4 they're
like we're gonna support this platform
form through 2020 which is next year now
they didn't say this platform will
support every single CPU that we
launched through 2020 maybe it will
maybe it won't
personally I don't get to give AMD a ton
of credit if I am able to take a be 350
or X 370 motherboard that launched in
when was that 2017 and take a processor
that launches in mid to late 2019 with
hell yeah a bunch more cores and threads
and drop it in there with a BIOS update
or something I think that's a pretty
significant achievement and something
that you don't see that often yeah I
wouldn't expect that sure but there's
been some level of promise made to us
that it will potentially support three
so I can see somebody who dropped three
hundred bucks on the high-end X 370
board a year and a half ago being like
alright I was really hoping to upgrade
to this and it would suck if they're
like alright Rison 3000 series we're
going to support up to the eight core 16
thread for older motherboards but if you
want any of the newer ones that have
higher core counts or something like
that you have to buy an x5 70 board or
whatever is required there we still
don't know that right we have to wait
and see and you wouldn't you would think
that if if they added you know that if
they had support for the next gen of
Verizon CPUs on their X 370 X power
gaming titanium that they I mean like
that's that's a very well-built board
it's it's it's pretty high-end it's very
very high-end and it's got really good
power delivery on it so like if they're
not gonna offer support on that that
means they're not gonna offer support on
any of their be 350 board
either I would imagine at least at least
for those affected rise in 3000 skews so
I feel like to coincide with AMD's
promise
msi is going to try though they're
working together msi an AMD are in talks
about this whole thing and AMD doesn't
want to obviously look bad and msi
doesn't want to make a MV look bad so
they're gonna try their best to please
the customer and fulfill the promise
that AMD made years ago so i feel i feel
more positive and optimistic about that
that i do this article so to round this
out msi did publish several lists of
their existing x 370 be 350 X 470 and be
450 motherboards that have been updated
to support next-gen AMD ap use so again
here like I just to try to sum up and be
clear about where I'm trying to levy
criticism versus where I'm trying to say
let's let's wait and see what happens
I think the articles and the handling of
the follow-up article from tech power up
could have been it could have been
better it could have been more
straightforward to people who are
reading this especially people who don't
have an initial impression of what's
going on right they're not familiar with
with any of this
a it's it's a it gives a bad impression
and I don't I don't think it's the best
journalism to be perfectly honest with
you at the same time we absolutely
should be looking closely at AMD as well
as their motherboard manufacturer
partners when it comes to this next
generation the Verizon 3,000 CPUs right
and motherboards and everything that
goes along with it I think we should
give credit where credit is due if
they're able to maintain compatibility
across the whole range I wouldn't be too
surprised again if there's backwards
compatibility to an extent but that some
newer higher core count CPUs do require
a new motherboard right and I think it
will be a question for the future
whether we can analyze that and say they
did this to sell more motherboards or
they did this because they had to yeah
couldn't they couldn't physically make
these new processors work on existing
motherboards
because of how their design yeah
intentions are everything with Intel
recently you could go back and you could
take LGA 1151 version 2 processors and
then drop them into older LGA 1151
motherboards with customized firmware
right and they would still work and in
that case you could be like intel you
sold us a new platform and forced us
into a new platform when you didn't
necessarily need to write but anyway
there's more to be said on this topic
but let's move on for now yeah hopefully
we've clarified that to some extent I
think so AMD more news they're launching
Rison embedded SOC s these are either
going to be very interesting to you or
not interesting at all I'll try to move
through it quickly embedded processors
so these are SOC s which means that they
have CPU cores as well as graphics and
integrated into them and these are going
to be sold to OEMs and ODMs which means
they're not necessarily something that
you're gonna be able to buy straight up
oh wow why is that
why is that so large oh it's Perl
interests and a bunch of mobile devices
so here the new two years the two new
SOC s or processors rise and embedded
are 1606 G and the are 1505 G impressive
thing about these processors is the TDP
12 to 25 watts frequency they go up to 3
point 3 gigahertz or 3.5 gigahertz
depending on whether you talking about
215 at 16 model only 2 cores and 4
threads so we're not talking about a
huge amount of power but Vega 3 GPU
integrated and dual 10 gigabit NICs
support wow that's a little thing here
on the end right that I was like that's
that's kind of weird
so talking about really low power
somewhat capable processors it's very
nice you could see you could see a fair
amount of implementations for this
though you're probably looking at little
like you know like those little mini PCs
that like like ZOTAC likes to sell
they're all integrated really small yeah
but like all you got is a bunch of ports
on the side and you plug it in and
you're like here
a new pc you can plug a monitor monitor
into it or whatever type of chip that
would do good and like an intel look
like you can do some really light you
know 720p or 1080p gaming probably won't
appear in an intel look but similar
products yeah I could imagine Atari is
gonna be using this in their new VCS
console so hmm you know that that's
that's one implementation of it um you
don't need necessarily a massive amount
of graphics one power to to emulate
Atari video games but they're gonna be
available this quarter already have
support from hardware and software
companies including Advantech asrock dfi
i base metronome and strata cache sun's
impressive display support capabilities
actually out of these processors that's
pretty cool on the next okay next one
here we go
three 4k sixty displays now we're not
talking about gaming we're not talking
3d acceleration but for embedded
solutions for like a lot of people have
at restaurants or the places where they
need displays no signage and digital
signage yes exactly so yeah up to three
for K displays up to 60 frames per
second h.265 encode and decode at ten
bit and vp9 decode capabilities as well
so for video playback you know of an
encoded video or something like that
sure seems seems pretty cool so anyway
like I said limited application for
those of you who might be looking to
build a gaming PC or something like that
right but what I was kind of interested
in something like this for is like maybe
like a pfsense box or something like
that you wouldn't necessarily need the
graphics for it but low-power SOC for
something along those lines the two ten
gigabit NIC capabilities of it and you'd
have to get granted that's just
something that's available from the SOC
it needs to be implemented with those
ports from like in a hardware integrator
like asrock sure to support that but
something like a really small sort of
central server for a home or something
like that that could sort of
administrative everything shut down all
your computers to save power but you
have one
single low-power unit that has like your
network network attached storage it
handles DVR capabilities for a TV or
something along those lines right so
yeah you can see a lot of potential
applications for this nice so cool let's
move up I'm interested this is from
TechCrunch
we have the e a Origin client which has
recently received an update this update
actually was pushed out on Monday so if
you guys are playing Apex legends or any
of the other games available on the
Origin client definitely make sure that
your client itself is updated because
there is an exploitable bug affecting
Windows users with the origin app
installed this has been patched but
older versions of the clients would
still be susceptible the source of this
bug is actually kind of an interesting
launch feature which reminded me a
little bit of the way steam launches
games but the origin client has its own
URL scheme that allows gamers to open
the app and load a game from a web page
by clicking a link with origin colon
slash slash to four double forward slash
in the address that's weird
researchers daily be and Dominic Penner
of underdog security found that the app
could be tricked into running any app on
the victims computer by using this dis
URL based launch method this allowed any
app to run at the same level of
privileges as the logged in user only
course could be used to allow a hacker
to run PowerShell commands that's bad
this could be triggered could be
triggered by a malicious link in an
email or web page or of course via
malware because malware can often
redirect your browser in the same sort
of way it was also possible according to
the the security of the researchers
tremendous underdog security to steal a
user's account access token using a
single line of code if you're a Mac user
the Mac OS client was not affected but
again origin rolled out a new client
update to their clients on Monday so
just make sure you've got that update if
you use that software have there have
there been any reported instances of
actual compromise or is it not is the
vulnerability backdoor was just brought
to our attention not that I referenced
in the article fortunately this is one
of those things that was brought up by I
believe white hat hackers underdog
security so they let them know of the
vulnerability and origin went ahead
thanks the Lord's work dated okay so
yeah
hats off again cheers Cheers white hat
security researchers out there we really
appreciate it I'm updating my origin as
soon as I get home all right
did you know seen Notre Dame yesterday I
did not see anything about Notre Dame I
don't follow the news really I'm kind of
under a rock but wifey sauce does and
she informing me of the Notre Dame burn
that's pretty crazy
yeah it was crazy to see yeah just cuz
it's one of those things that seems
timeless yeah semen it's like it's gonna
be there forever and something like it's
just burning yeah if like the Eiffel
Tower got bombed it was just no longer
there like what is even Paris yeah I
don't even know sounds absolutely crazy
fortunately as of now it seems I mean I
don't think they've come out with any
further information about what caused
the fire to start originally but it
doesn't appear to be arson it doesn't
like I said I don't speculate but it
doesn't seem to be a terrorist act or
anything like that okay maybe it was an
accident maybe it had something to do
with these they're doing renovations on
it at the time but why are we talking
about this on a tech show the reason is
because well I was interested in
following doesn't yesterday but there is
a really cool implementation of
technology which might help to restore a
Notre Dame and the articles linked and
all my articles linked to the
description by the way if you guys want
to check out more reading but this is
from MIT Technology Review Notre Dame
had a digital scan done of the entire
Cathedral four years ago in 2015
so yeah Notre Dame itself is eight
hundred and fifty years old it's located
in Paris
massive damage yesterday and a fire
fortunately I mean relatively
fortunately it's mostly the wood
parts were burned a lot of it was built
of stone so that stuff stayed intact
it's just black stone now but this
digital exact digital replica was
captured by an architectural and
architectural historian named Andrew
Talon unfortunately he has passed away
so Andrew but have his hard drives
passed away but we greatly appreciate
the work he has done
there's be a great WD or see a dad
there's a National Geographic video
that's linked in the article where you
where it goes over his procedures his
methodology for capturing this digital
scan you can see the equipment that he
used there its uses lasers it shoots a
bunch of lasers out they bounce off it
it determines how long for the lasers to
return back to the sensor and then you
basically map out a 3d model
so this will hopefully allow them to I
have to imagine this is going to be
helpful with the restoration project
there's been a bunch of really rich
people in Europe they're like the Louie
Vuitton guy and a couple other oh really
the guy apparently in France if you they
don't like over almost 100 for a
designer in Europe or France or whatever
you can you can just drop a hundred
million on something like that but it's
funny because is I don't remember the
names there's two dudes one guy was like
I'm gonna I'm gonna donate a hundred
million towards his restoration and he
was like the Louie Vuitton guy or
something like that and then the other
guy who's like his kind of rival yeah it
was like I'm gonna donate 200 it's like
a it's like a really generous rivalry
yes
so someone someone in chat said 700
millions been donated 700 million okay
that's nothing about 350 this morning
that's up from earlier so that's cool
but here's a lot of angry designers
here's the actual digital recreation
looks like I'm in the matrix you know
and granted they're bouncing around here
so I imagine it's it's gonna resolve
itself it's one of Jensen's retracing
demos yeah you you this is this is using
Ansel I believe you got to see how the
whole thing's put together and then much
useless space I guess the whole reason I
wanted to bring this up is you know it
was a it was a there's a huge tragedy
yesterday whether you're
Catholic or French or European or you
just appreciate works of art or anything
like that there's a lot of sort of
silver linings to the story that a bunch
of artwork they were able to remove from
it before it burned down so that was
cool but you know they're gonna rebuild
it I am oh yeah I have no doubt about
that if they rebuild this and cool that
they were able to do this just in time
another thing that I I caught a lot of
yesterday was people who were like their
yesterday or a day before or something
like that
timmi timmi tech TV I don't know if
you're watching right now but he was
there he was in he did a Europe trip or
something I saw some of his posts on on
Twitter and he visited and he was like
they're like within the last week oh my
god so he got to kind of see it before
it Wow for the the burning down happened
but yes many objects inside notre dame
were saved by the 400 or so firefighters
who tackled the blaze there have been no
major injuries reported so you know it's
a sad thing but there there's some
silver linings to talk about so damn
move Facebook sucks you guys should not
use Facebook all right this was this I
don't have a lot to say about this story
it was kind of a late addition and it's
on a telegraph technology excuse me
intelligence page which is a paid
website to read the whole thing but I've
read multiple stories about this
multiple locations Facebook has filed
for a patent and have been granted to
that patent in the United States for a
system which can detect photos people
have uploaded that feature items such as
alcoholic drinks and snacks the company
would then pass those images to the
brand's which would then turn them into
advertisements for Facebook users to say
see so it would in turn it into
advertisements add your pictures without
your filament although if you are using
Facebook surfing to the shoot in terms
of service which means you do can send
okay continue I deleted my facebook
account but good I should do the same
point being here
like I'm gonna phrase this thing I still
need to know my friends birthdays I try
to think back like five years and 10
years and 15 years
and sort of the evolution of the
Internet in my lifetime and everything
like that and there was a there is a I
feel like there is this Golden Age of
online reviews in like the mid to late
2000s before like 2010 2011 2012 when
you could go online you could read
reviews from actual people of things and
their feedback and responses to them
when we worked at Newegg that was one of
the things I was most proud of about the
Newegg website was the review system
right and that I knew the guy who
monitored the reviews yeah and like I
knew how he worked and as like he does
it right yeah he knows that if you just
let a review come in that's paid for or
that's a shill or that's fake or
whatever in us
yes it's Dennis yeah he still works over
there I don't usually say his name I
follow him on Twitter because it's all's
me and it's a this is going back several
years but he never wanted people to know
that that was his job I don't know of
course is alias I don't know if that's
still his real name yeah it's not really
his actual name is Gerard Ishod yes yes
hey Roger
so point being sort of like so if it's
five years later and you're a a marketer
you're trying to market and sell a
product and you're like ah this whole
online trend of real people saying like
I use this product and it was good
that's great we need more of that yeah
and they're like well but people use the
product and they think it sucks and they
go screw that all we need is pictures of
people with the product and then we can
post that just to their friends they're
using that product and then they will
buy that product but I'm holding it as
my son is using that yeah obviously I
want to use it too it's in their room
yeah they've out for it anyway there's
lots of questions about what
how will the information that you upload
to the Internet be used this is just an
example of Facebook getting a patent to
use the images that you upload for ads
okay everyone delete their Facebook now
this is terrible this is this is
unprecedented there's nothing there's
never anything I wouldn't call it
unprecedented really in the past I've
never seen
add of like Grey Goose vodka from one of
my friends smashed an abortion once
Facebook bought Instagram everyone there
was like alright anything you post on
Instagram can is now the property of
Facebook to be used how they how they
prefer I don't know if this is anything
deeper that it's just gonna be like some
algorithm based thing that was like you
know it goes in and it recognizes the
product and then automatically feeds
that to your friends as an ad and wonder
how this is gonna look is it gonna be
the actual picture that your friend took
wasted at a party with like a Grey Goose
lot logo at the bottom and it's just
gonna be like that's it and that's the
ad and it's gonna be under you know when
you when you're scrolling through your
Facebook feed it's gonna say sponsors
gonna give a little sponsored tags you
know it's sponsored and it's just a
picture of your friend smashed off his
ass with a bottle of Grey Goose for the
like is that how is that how raw its
gonna be is it just a general literal
pork over of the actual image and they
slap their brand on it or is it gonna be
altered at all I just I mean I cannot
say for sure because the article is
slightly limited in that information is
your friend gonna look 15 pounds later I
also don't pay them to be able to read
the whole article which kind of sucks
but yeah I mean that's crazy the idea
that a picture you post if it happens to
have a product in it might be identified
by Facebook so scary image scanning
algorithm and then fed whether it's to
your friends or just to random people
like hey here's a real person using that
product obviously they're having a good
time and this awesome selfie that you
set up to you like you know did
everything perfect I mean maybe if and
now and now guess who they don't have to
pay yeah some marketing company ever
like yeah develop some campaign and do
something like like specialized
photographer was gonna say be a little
different if they asked for your
permission and you got a cut for
advertising this product oh they
wouldn't do that no I know maybe in a
perfect world but I'm just saying this
seems this seems like the the user is
getting fucked over what it would it
change your reaction to this if you were
getting a cut yeah yeah yeah welcome to
the real world asshole
fuck yeah
it's my picture I took it I made this ad
for you that you're potentially gonna
you know if I've got 2,000 friends on
Facebook or whatever I did all the idle
legwork where's my cut yeah at least
leave your free bottle of Grey Goose
Jesus I've no traveling with them
co-opting my images and using them
however they see fit
you've got to opt into it as long you
gotta opt into it you got as long as I
can wet my beak too I guess
capitalism I mean you've gotta opt into
it you should have the full right to say
no I want to be a Facebook user and use
the platform but not be subjected to
this advertising it would be nice to
have and I want nothing to do with it
you should have that option too but if
you do have the option to opt in you
should get paid for it I have opted out
of Facebook entirely at this point so
all I have is a placeholder account so I
can manage my hardware page I literally
keep it for friends birthdays who I
forget I'm like oh god is it Paris
birthday all right one more oh please
you just brought something up so on and
pointed out I was gonna tweet this but I
didn't here's a fun social experiment to
do delete your Facebook account see if
anyone knows wait any given number of
months and then have your birthday come
and go and see how many people still
remember your birthday I tested this
recently yeah not many people throw
their birthday that's exactly why I kept
my birthday private on Facebook that's
so because I don't want a bunch of
people just saying it to say it exactly
so do you have anything to say Anika
happy birthday thanks thank you thank
you
that's not where I was leading on
Liriano sir I had an event just recently
and they revealed they're pretty cool
looking monitored 43 inch VA yeah I saw
joking productions uh yes Joker has a
video this is the predator CG for three
7kp and there's an article on tech power
up about it just launched today and it's
not launched it was shown at an event oh
you actually have Joker went to the
events this is also linked in the
description I don't know what he's
saying here but there's there's a
monitor it's a predator see
for three 7kp 43 inch VA panel covers
90% of the DCI p3 color space it's
pretty good 4k resolution 144 Hertz
refresh rate with adaptive sync support
and a maximum 100 I'm sorry 1000
semi-free sync nits of brightness yes
free sync adaptive sync support is free
sync which means it should also be
supported by juicing g-sync
select g9 cards what is it 916 about max
enemy above I forget something like that
but yeah 1000 its brightness which means
it should also be able to meet the HDR
1000 certification although it's not
clear from these articles whether or not
that is supported
there's jokers jerker's video as well as
the tech power article techpowerup
article or linked in the description so
yeah just one of those monitors it has
an absolutely kind of crazy spec range
but the size as well yeah that's pretty
impressive and you can do it that and 4k
monitors are becoming a lot more viable
now that we have a next generation of
GPUs that are slightly printing the
performance curve down with in price
range for a few more people so yeah
that's cool it's got three HDMI inputs
and that's probably because this seems
to be like kind of a crossover
product aimed not just at PC gamers and
in desktop computer users but also at
console gamers yeah because you could
easily plug a console into this you're
not gonna bring necessarily be able to
game it to max resolution and everything
we can still plug it this is for gamers
who like gaming in the living room yes I
think it's it's kind of DisplayPort so
if you want to use actives adaptive sink
or the g-sync variant of that which no
4k TV does that's also true it's also
got a USB 3.1 C port so that's
convenient comes with a remote control
also part of the kind of a crossover
most monitors don't have remotes but you
know sometimes I would like a remote for
a monitor I would say it right now I've
got 4k monitors side-by-side the one on
the left has its controls tucked away on
the right side
against each other sighs so no wonder
enough to get to the growls right and
right now I'm switching back and forth
between two computers so I keep having
to go up to get inputs what and its
really annoying it's actually made me
really appreciate the the sort of new
thing that the joystick symbologies have
yeah as a single those are great button
at the bottom with a little joystick
full g-spot because it allows you to
push it maneuver around do whatever
controls he wants yeah and you don't
have to reach around the side or
anything like that's some feeding on
anything yes that's convenient I'm not
sure how much this is gonna cost because
we have conflicting information from
both sources techpowerup says - it's
gonna be 1499 gyros 200 and available in
the summer euros
Joker says 1299 US dollars okay that's a
better price I'm gonna go with Joker's
Joe Joker I think he's got a right
1299 US dollars yeah should be available
summer 2019 so nice keep an eye out for
that if he wants a very large
high-resolution display with some really
cool features cool that's nice okay we
have one more segment for my half and
that is mail time oh yeah so we're gonna
get some mail over there that's a mail
alright so this was so guys if you want
to send either of us mail check the
video description I have my peel Box
listed down there you can send stuff
over I checked my PA box with some
regularity and random things appear
there we're gonna unbox a few those
right now now this actually came in last
week and I had no idea what it was or
where it came from
it's from mouch in China and China like
untracked know and it said underwear on
it so I thought what is very-- it's this
it's under way it's is it your size it's
very lacy it'd be really creepy if it
was like your exact waist size it's like
how should think so I is this actually
came in last week I immediately brought
it back to my wife to be like this was
sent
by a fan okay this is so so did we get a
real-time demo is it gonna be all
registry I don't know why this has
arrived or what we're gonna do with it
or anything of it for whoever did send
that we have a letter here this is from
Larry mr. Larry uh he's to say hello
Paul this past year I got into computers
I've learned so much from you and Kyle I
have two questions first as I just
finished my first build a asus prime v
450 plus and a risin 320 200 G that's a
nice solution there I use the factory
CPU fan but later swapped and swapped it
out with an aftermarket fan from be
quiet now the question well change of
the fan I pulled the CPU out of the
socket does this hurt anything no pins
are broken it receded and I had my CMOS
cleared and it booted reason I asked
this question is now I'm scared to
remove the fan to make sure the thermal
paste is good it maintains 25c at idle
and 52c at load next what let me answer
your first question before I move on to
the next one you're totally fine yeah
risin risin heatsink there so the rising
heatsink fans which are good I mean
they're not awesome but compare them to
Intel's stock heatsink fans and they're
significantly better they have upgrades
like an actual copper slug at the bottom
that's much better if you heat
dissipation right and I like that they
just have a nice clean black fan finish
like you can install it and it doesn't
stand out and look matches with IDs or
anything like that
yeah these are somewhat aureus though
for the stock thermal paste that's pre
applied on there it's like glue so I've
seen so many people go to remove these
and pull the entire CPU out of the
socket
it's not the best I wouldn't want to do
that if I could avoid it right you can't
avoid that by pulling it off while it
while it's warm you can either run this
run the system for a while turn it off
and then pull it off immediately while
single arm to you can give a little
twist I've seen people take
hairdryer and pointed at it just to warm
it up and loosen it up as well but
honestly even if you pull the whole CPU
out as long as you're pulling straight
out right up so you don't bend or damage
any of the pins you can remove it clean
it off drop it back in I have I have
been to pin or two from pulling it out
that way at an angle and not really
being conscious of of doing it straight
up so it is a serious concern so as long
as you're pulling it straight up or if
you're heating up first you should be
okay and if you do bends pins on a PG a
processor like that they can be bent
back yes you have to be very careful
it's not for the faint of heart but you
can bend them back get everything back
to where it should be and reinstall it
and use like a razor straight address
and from everything you're saying here
25 C at idle 52 C under load you're good
it's really no need to check your
thermal face you're totally good next
question is I want to build one more and
I want to use an ASIS prime X for 70 Pro
is this a better board so Larry I would
my question be what cpu are you gonna
installed in that in that x4 70 Pro we
often recommends the the 50 series
motherboards which would be B 450
there's also be 350 because you can
still overclock with them and one of the
main advantages of the higher-end like
an X 470 is two-way graphics card
support but most people really never do
that yeah
yes some of the higher-end boards do
have other nice features sometimes they
have better power delivery for
overclocking higher and see if you use
and everything I would not recommend an
ace whose prime X 470 with another rise
in 320 200 G and I would recommend an X
470 if you're thinking of something like
a 2700 X or a 2600 X something you're
gonna like overclock a bit other than
that you're probably gonna be paying
more for extra features and your power
delivery and stuff like that that you're
not gonna actually make use of he also
says I'll try to send you some cookies
next time because I don't know if Kyle
shared or not
did he say police which cookies Larry
sent you cookies you didn't share I'm
concerned that he might have sent it to
my P o box after it
oh right Larry we're having done we will
absolutely your cookies Larry yeah
please resend them because I don't think
I'll ever know the old box is no longer
active okay so if you guys want to send
anything right now seven to Paul it's my
video box yeah and you're gonna do
another one at some point yes okay
eventually we'll update with that yeah
what do we got here
okay I just opened this is from Alex W
from Minnesota I'm guessing that's bent
MN and Andrew W oh sorry Andrew W oh my
