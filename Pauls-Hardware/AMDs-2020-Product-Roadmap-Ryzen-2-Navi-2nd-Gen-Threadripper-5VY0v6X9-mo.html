Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool so
guys I was actually invited to Las Vegas
a little bit early by AMD and they held
a tech day on January 6 2018 where they
shared some excellent and exciting news
about their upcoming products for 2018
so that's what this video is going to be
all about I'm gonna be just doing a
talking heads thing and sharing some
slides with you and that kind of thing
bear in mind that anything I'm showing
you guys as far as performance numbers
where was all provided directly by AMD
so take it with a grain of salt of
course and we will be of course testing
these products once they become
available but we have announced and
Confirmation of rise in to coming very
soon in April and we also have a bunch
of new products because they laid out
their a roadmaps for CPU and GPU going
all the way through 2020 although they
are slightly vague but let's start there
roadmaps so sorry for the CPU roadmap
and of course in 2017 AMD launched rise
in their first Zen based product it had
a 52 percent instructions per clock
improvement versus their old excavator
architecture it was very well received
and that's all new old news now though
of course that was 2017 we're in 2018
now so Zen plus is the refinement of the
Zen microarchitecture and they're
actually moving it from 14 nanometer
down to 12 nanometer so slight reduction
in the process size which should
hopefully potentially lead to some
efficiency hand enhancements and maybe
even some higher overclocking
performance Zen plus is what the rise in
- family of CPUs for desktop will be
based on so keep an eye out for those in
April 2018 and then looking beyond that
in 2019 presumably just based on how
they laid these out they started at 2017
and they ended at 2020 so I'm assuming
the the ones in between line up with the
different years that should correspond
so in 2019 we should get Zen to the
actual new microarchitecture not just a
refinement of the original Zen
microarchitecture that's also going to
be moving to the seven nanometer
manufacturing process so shrinking it
down even smaller
they say the design is complete for Zen
- as far as the microarchitecture goes
and also apparently suck it Intel under
your crappy 10 nanometer process so
they're moving to seven which is pretty
small incredibly small actually looking
even further than that though in 2020 we
have Xen 3 the third version of this
microarchitecture and that's going to be
on a refinement of the 7 nanometer
process and according to AMD they're on
track so in 2020 is n3 looking forward
to that too let's move over to the GPU
roadmap though this one is not quite as
rich when it comes to details but of
course in 2017 AMD launched Vega at
least the Radeon technologies group and
in 2018 they're planning on moving the
Vega GPU architecture down again to that
7 nanometer process I believe it using
Global Foundries for that and apparently
from everything they're telling us
yields must be somewhat decent so far or
if they're not there they're just not
sharing that information yet but they
seem very optimistic about that process
and then moving beyond that in 2019
again presumably based on just how they
laid everything out here we'll have Navi
and na vi's the actual successor GPU
architecture to Vega and we'll have to
see how that actually plays out it's
still just sort of a word that's out
there in the ether right now but you
guys can already start saying I'm gonna
wait for Navi that's probably what most
people say and then again looking even
beyond that all the way out to 2020 we
have what's is only being called
next-gen 7 nanometre plus GPU
microarchitecture so they're not even
sharing the codename with it yet so we
can't even say I'm gonna wait I'm gonna
wait for Navi I'm gonna wait for that
next-gen thing hopefully they'll have
some new exciting name for a soon there
but look forward for that in 2020 on the
7 nanometer plus process now to get a
little bit more specific for 2018 they
gave us a little bit more of a refined
roadmap so in q1 we've got the rise in
desktop apu that's actually coming in
february 12th we also have a mobile apu
so we're finally seeing Rison plus vega
in AP use come out for both the desktop
and the mobile side that's really
exciting when whether you're gonna build
a entry level desktop or whether you're
looking for a nice thin and light laptop
in q2 we should have rise into again
that's coming in April for the desktop
and we're also gonna have rise in Pro
mobile and of course the pro just means
it's more tailored for an enterprise
environment finally in the second half
of this year one of the most exciting
things I think that was announced is
second gen thread Ripper so they are
working on that very sparse on the
details but just says second half which
could be as early as
June or is latest December so they're
still leaving it wide open for that also
in the second half we're expecting
second-gen risin Pro so let's talk some
more details about risin 2 and then we
also have some rise in one price drops
that are happening right now but more of
those just a sec risin to is announced
resons who's launching in April 2018
they're already sampling risin two CPUs
two hardware partners for some
motherboard manufacturers for example so
they can get their motherboards all set
up it's gonna have higher clock speeds
it's also going to feature precision
Boost 2.0 and precision boosters
extremely popular with the original
risin that's got a new opportunistic
algorithm that it uses to overclock your
processor automatically and the new
process technology that they're using
since they've shrunk it down a little
bit allows rising to to run at the same
frequency while using the same voltage
or at a higher frequency with less
voltage basically less voltage less heat
which typically means that you can run
at a higher sustained clock speed also
they have per core booster now so rather
than boosting two cores or all cores at
the same time you can actually do them
all individually which is very helpful
for specific applications that might
only use a single CPU threat for example
now aMDA already promised that a.m. for
their actual socket for the CPUs was
gonna be viable up through 2020 and they
have confirmed that here isin two CPUs
will be able to drop into existing a m4
based motherboards with 300 series
chipset sets such as B 350 and X 370
however there will also be a new set of
motherboards with 400 series chipsets so
there's going to be an X 470 that's what
they've confirmed with us so far and I
would imagine there's also going to be
some be 450 type variants of that as
well since that was insanely popular for
budget builds the actual difference
between going with say a 300 series
motherboard with a rise in two processor
and a 400 series motherboard with a
resin to processor is not yet fully
known they did seem to indicate that
there might be some improvement that you
get by going with the newer motherboard
it's optimized for second gen Rison so
you might have what they say more
performance and lower power but it's not
really clear what exactly they mean by
that whether they're going to give you
access to additional features or whether
you're actually going to get a little
bit more performance out of Verizon to
CPU so I'm hoping they can balance that
in a way that people who are using older
motherboards will still feel like
they're viable but people who get the
new motherboards will
get something for the being on the
bleeding edge of technology I suppose
now in case you're wondering there's
forward and backwards compatibility as
well so horizon one CPU from last year
will work in these new x4 70
motherboards as well so you know you can
you can swap those out if you want to I
suppose but nice to have broad
compatibility across that also as
mentioned rise in first gen CPU price
drops which should be an effect right
now if you go over to hopefully I'll put
some links in the description but if you
covered a New Ager
Amazon you should be able to find some
crazy good deals very similar to what we
saw actually for the Black Friday
pricing this year so that's pretty cool
the 1900 X for example on the high-end
thread Ripper platform is $450 now down
from 550 1800 X is $350 down from the
original MSRP of 500 and like the r5
1600 the really really popular six core
CPU is now one hundred and ninety
dollars down from 220 so for anyone
who's looking to invest now if you need
a new desktop now and you can't wait
till April 1 rising to launches you can
get some good deals on the existing Xen
based processors next announcement from
AMD is Radeon Vega mobile they also
announced Radeon Vega on 7 nanometer but
that's a very specific product more on
that in a second
this is gonna be for laptops of course
so you have Radeon Vega it's been out
for a little while we've mainly seen it
in large discreet products but they've
shrunk it way down they're using the
same Vega core that they're using for
example for the Vega 56 or Vega 64
they've gone from 1 HB m to stack down
to from 2 down to 1 and that shrinks
down the size of the actual package
significantly it also only has a one
point seven millimeter Z hider
top to bottom which means for thin and
light laptops and notebooks or all in
ones you save on vertical space also
allows better cooling solutions for
example when you can actually get your
chip down that small so that's really
cool gonna be suitable for ultra thin
laptops does it still have HP m2 memory
is VR capable according to AMD and then
they also announced that 7 nanometre
Vega product it's going to be a Radeon
instinct machine learning product which
was some of the products they announced
really early with Vega that they
actually launched really early with Vega
so probably
gonna be as applicable to you guys out
there since I don't know how many of you
dabble in machine learning but it does
show that they've managed to take their
Vega architecture and shrink it down and
get it working on seven nanometers so
that's pretty exciting as well the theme
that they kept going with was Vega
everywhere they want Vega GPU
architecture to be in as many different
places as possible so whether you're
talking about stuff like next-gen
consoles or whether you're talking about
desktop graphics cards laptop graphics
cards or even integration with their
partners they announced late last year
and Intel and Radeon sort of semi-custom
chip design with a mobile Intel CPU and
a mobile Radeon Vega GPU so you're gonna
see Vega in a lot of different places
which is cool because it does have
extremely good efficiency if you're
running it at the right frequency so
it's exciting to see what type of
products are going to come out with
Radeon Vega mobile and finally at long
last we have ap use yes we were
expecting them long ago last year
because a lot of the original am4
motherboards had video outs on them and
you can't really use a video out on
another board unless you have an
integrated GPU as part of your CPU but
they really only launched a couple ApS
at the very end of last year they were
well-received but I feel like I didn't
hear about them too much they're
expanding that lineup though this year
and they're also moving it not just from
ApS are going to be using laptops but
also socketed desktop APs and that's
what desktop users who are looking for
an entry-level build or something that's
just to get off the ground that can do
some light gaming but also is a very
functional computer it's a very good
application for these ap use so we have
an r5 2400 G that's a 4 core 8 thread
APU has a 3.6 gigahertz base and a 3.9
gigahertz boosts 11 compute units 65
watt TDP and it does include Vega
graphics that are running in its 1215
megahertz it's going to cost a hundred
and sixty nine dollars which is actually
five bucks less than the than the non
APU four core eight thread rise in the
original resin part but we'll we'll see
if there's a difference in clock speed
or something like that when it comes
down to it but overclockable graphics
AMD did have a brief overclocking demo
that they
where they clock the GPU up to about 15
50 megahertz and then all the way up to
1675 got some nice performance boost
from that and they were comparing it to
an Intel a solution the i5 8400 which
costs about $200 of course the
integrated graphics from AMD tend to
kick the crap out of intel's integrated
graphics so it definitely shows you the
value of something like an APU when for
170 dollars you can get the roughly
equivalent performance of what with the
Intel side you'd have to go for about a
$200 processor plus probably adding a
discrete GPU on top of it as well
there's also a more budget option and
our three model the 2,200 G it's a four
core four thread processor 3.5 gigahertz
base 3.7 gigahertz boost eight compute
units also with Vega graphics and that's
going to be sub $100 I believe $99 just
the price for that one and they did have
a couple cool product demos that showed
us for example a very small mini PC with
a mini ITX motherboard with the APU in
there and thanks to the low TDP our
lowish TDP of 65 watts able to power it
with an external brick so some pretty
cool implementations I think we're going
to see with these ApS once they start to
get out on the market more and of course
them being socketable means that you're
gonna have a much better time
integrating it in the desktop build of
your choice because you can go full-size
and mini ITX or anything in between
which I guess is micro ATX anyway they
also have mobile ap use of course a
couple more that they've announced in q1
2018 to go along with the couple that
they announced at the end of 2017 r3
2300 U is a four core four thread part
with six compute units and the 2200 U is
a 2 core 4 thread part with 3 compute
units those should be very affordable at
least when it comes to bomb costs these
are mobile ApS again so they're going to
be integrated by laptop manufacturers
the products that they'll be integrated
into include 2 and ones ultra thins and
even gaming laptops and they did show a
demo running Wolfenstein 2 on the r3
2300 you part they are playing at 1080p
it only has a 15 watt power draw which
is awesome for a laptop especially with
an integrated APU and it wasn't like the
most amazing gameplay you've ever seen
but it was definitely playable and given
that it's only drawing 15 watts that's
insanely good they also announced mobile
XFR
stead of frequency range so if you're
using one of these ap use and you have a
laptop with better cooling that's built
into it or even if you get something
like an add-on like maybe a laptop stand
with fans or something like that if you
can keep the CPU cooler it's going to
kick in that XFR and give you a little
bit higher frequency to trade off with
the lower temperature last part of this
was the announcement of rise in Pro
mobile and this is again just a pro
version of these ap use with added
features for security manageability and
longevity which is important of course
for enterprise customers who want to
make sure that they're getting the most
bang for their buck and make sure that
their products are supported for a
really long time I see these rise in AP
use as potentially a really nice entry
level variable refresh rate gaming
solutions I feel like these desktop AP
use you can plop in without having to
fork over the cash for a discreet
graphics card pair it with the budgets
free sync or free sync to monitor
hopefully we'll see more free seeing two
monitors coming out this year and I
think that would be a great solution
because the lower frame rates that you
might get with something like an AP you
would be greatly helped by a variable
refresh rate monitor but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for my first video of
CES 2018 and you know speaking of those
new am4 motherboards I have a feeling
that there's going to be a few of those
on display this week so definitely stay
tuned I have tons more videos planned
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you did enjoy it and of course one
final thank you to my sponsors for this
event deep cool Coolermaster enter Max
and ocz Toshiba thanks for watching guys
we'll see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
