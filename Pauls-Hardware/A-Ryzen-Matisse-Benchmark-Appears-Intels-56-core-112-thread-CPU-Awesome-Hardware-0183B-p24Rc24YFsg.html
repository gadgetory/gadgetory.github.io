my wife talking about where we're gonna
go to dinner
good times good stuff to look forward to
hi everyone welcome welcome to awesome
hardware this is a live show about
technology we've livestream every week
on Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time and we stream the whole show to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware so hi
hi guys if you're watching on twitch
thanks for being here we love you all if
you don't like twitch because it's too
purple you can watch on YouTube
we already streamed the first half of
this week's episode number 183 - Kyle's
channel bit wit he's not here right now
cuz he had to pee but that's there it's
linked in the description if you want to
check it out
if you're still watching live thanks for
being here on YouTube - we love you guys
so very much quick word of warning we do
drink some alcohol on the show beer
usually please join us if you can do so
responsibly in your of age and it's
legal in your jurisdiction of course we
occasionally use adult language so watch
out for that and we have a good time we
talk about technology and it's gonna be
great second half of the show
get some AMD news got some some Intel
news we're gonna do we're gonna do sword
fight classic Sarge fight segment so
thanks for being here guys now real
quick
if you are Billy coats Billy coats and
you tried to send something to my p.o
box which is p.o box for three to five
Diamond Bar California nine one seven
six five yes and pulse pulse hardware
Billy they didn't they didn't keep the
package there long enough they returned
it I'm sorry
so Billy I'm very sorry that the package
got returned to you that was not my
intent
please if you I hope they refunded the
shipping cost but please if you can
resend it I would love to see what you
were sending me how long had it been
since you checked your p.o box it
arrived on March 11th today is April 2nd
they're supposed to hang on to it for 30
days I thought oh but this one got
returned so well yeah maybe it was like
300 pounds
you don't know how big you I don't maybe
if it's a giant bag it's too big they
don't wait a month I guess that's
possible you never really know for sure
you know what I should need to do still
is open up that yeah there so I can see
what my chat saying what's in the box oh
yeah I should open up your chest nice so
we can talk to people by the way thank
you really quick to all the people who
donated I see some really nice donations
you guys are super generous I'll be
reading all the donation messages to
those on the after party yes we'll get
around to you after party coming soon
thank you it's gonna be great but before
all that uh-oh
quick party quick plug no no that's the
wrong thing so whoa that was weird what
I don't know it just did Oh cuz I hit a
head a shortcut key I showed everyone
the show dock which isn't a big deal or
thing it's just you know it's
professional where here it is my store
Paul's hardware is my store if you guys
want to buy stuff our merchandise go to
Paul's harbor net for my stuff I have
shirts mugs hoodies pint glasses it's
all real high-quality merch so if you
need a good heavy check it out and get
one with my logo on it captain
thumbscrew new design super great
everyone get one of those I need to get
one of these sent over so I can start
wearing it so you guys can see it under
and indirect it's on my tail pulse I
read that net though for my stuff and
some like big weight x lash store is Cal
store you can also buy stuff there yep
I've got a lot of good stuff it's all
great and if you buy awesome hardware
merch don't worry - both of us we share
we share those so order from either
store if you order during the show we
will shout out your name during the
after party along with all the people
who make donation comments so thanks for
those let's get back to tech news on the
news all right so we've been talking a
lot about rising 3000 series because
we're excited about it
AMD's next generation of processors
gonna be based on seven an ohmmeter
manufacturing process which is also
pretty exciting potentially beating
Intel to the die shrink the the
single-digit die shrink well I guess
until what
in 10 nanometre but anyway yeah but we
now have even more data on this this was
sourced from reddit the articles from
Tom's Hardware linked in the description
if you guys want to check it out but
this is a sigh soft database entry from
the site soft official live rank or
database it appears to be a quad-core
risin 3000 series processor that was
benchmarked and had data submitted
because the benchmark left the internet
connection plugged in the test was with
MSI's Meg X 570 creation motherboard
which if MSI is thinking what the
current naming scheme should be their
top of the line X 570 board which is
supposed to be the new chipset that
launches along with the rise in 3000
series this is in what is this German
yeah it's barren there additionally
ashliegash windy keep leash tomb so I
forgive it that's in the wind eek eeeek
there's some scores in there I'll come
back to the scores themselves a geek
because I'm gonna say other things first
the product identifier is 2d s 104 bbm
for GH to underscore 38 to / 34
underscore n of course my first guess
everyone immediately is like well that's
an engineering sample from AMD
obviously there's actually a better way
to determine that as detail than the
Tom's Hardware article but we're just
we're just taking a shortcut it's as
probably an engineering example which
makes sense at this point in time it is
a four core and a thread processor it
has a three point four gigahertz base
clock and a 3.8 gigahertz boost clock as
well as four Meg's of l2 cache and 16
Meg's of l3 cache also a 65 watt TDP
which would also fall in line with the
TDP s that current rise in the second
gen quad cores are falling within even
some 6 cores depending on the clock
speeds as mentioned this was derived
from reddit or originally posted on
reddit there is a reddit discussion
going on here
reddit that's reddit post there's a
reddit post anyway I was gathering this
information rather hastily so I leaned
on the
commenters which ready comments are
there often really really helpful
but anyway Loon craz posted this bit of
extra data about it again links are in
the description if you guys want to
check it out but long story short we're
looking at about 11% instructions per
clock improvement if you were to compare
a four core and eight thread current gen
rise and processor I believe he used
2200 G sorry 2400 G yeah yeah if you
compare current gen 2000 series
processor to that score with a fork or a
thread part running it at the same
frequency 11 percent improvement which
which is which is good which also you
know seems to fall in line with
expectations yeah you know it's not
Gayle scale that up scale this is good
it's not great but that's good but it's
good but scale that up to you know your
six core and your eight core and maybe
your 12 core and 16 core parts and
that's a massive improvement especially
for the higher core counts if they can
maintain that's IPC performance with the
higher core counts and frequencies sure
also bear in mind we're talking about a
3.8 gigahertz boost so we could scale up
the frequency potentially a bit beyond
that as well speculation is that the
demos that AMD has been sharing thus far
like what they showed us see yes we're
running at 4 gigahertz but we might get
beyond that since 2nd gen rise and
already is able to hit 4.2 to 4.3 year
it's I'm one or two cores depending on
your your the quality of your chip and
everything Verizon 3000 series
processors are expected mid-year
according to AMD so most of us are
expecting that means a Computex at least
announcements we're not sure if it's
launching right then or may actually
launch a month later or so should have
PCI Express Gen 4 support this current
generation is codenamed matisse and it
will feature the news and 2
microarchitecture 7 nanometre process
and it's going to be produced by TSMC
was there an MSI Meg creation board for
X 470 yeah well no I know there's a
that's the that's the godlike and I'm
looking at it right that was previously
z3 name
like creation was $2.99 I just did it
billed as X 299 okay but I think this is
the first time that a creation boards
been introduced to like the mainstream
offerings mainstream cpu offerings so
its previously high-end desktop only so
that's a change that's weird that's a
change that might be MSI trying to take
the branding that they've done for the
creation level skew board that they've
done with X 299 and say now that X 299
high-end desktop level board that we
make for that yeah we've now made one
for X 570 right because you can get an
16 core processor with 32 threads it
definitely seems more hitches which is
kind of like blurring the line of a
high-end desktop computer yeah very very
very much so so great that would that
would make some sense so cool that's
cool all right moving on that article by
the way was from I already said sometime
next articles from an AM Tech this one's
by Ian and he got to go and visit Intel
at their data centric innovation day
hooray
heyo the ID this is all enterprise stuff
so it's above most of our heads to be
perfectly honest but the thing I like
about enterprise stuff is just the raw
performance that's often discussed there
and you'll often see will never use
stuff they do an enterprise space that's
you know trickles down to some extent to
the lower end so first off we have the
next generation the the new second
generation the Xeon scalable processor
which is codenamed cascade Lake this is
a shot of the processor itself it's very
large I forgive it out what LGA that
version that has been LG 8lg big many
many pins LGA thousands of pins there's
a little side-by-side chart here looking
at first gen skylake sp2 second gen
cascade Lake now pointing and need to
point out here that this is not new
CPU architecture it's still 40
nanometers skylake based so same cpu
architecture is existing Xeon but
they've done a lot of cool upgrades like
Hardware mitigations against Specter and
melt meltdown that in the enterprise
space is a huge deal like very very
substantial huge deal because anyone
who's working in a data center are
working for a large company that are
that might be a target for something
like that you want do you want security
against against that type of things so
that's big that's good we also have
obtained DC persistent memory support
double the memory support and up to 25%
extra cores you'll notice here on sky
like SP we had the 80-100 series that
went up to 28 cores now we have the 9200
series going up to 56 cores and a
hundred and twelve threads on a single
CPU package that's not a single die mind
you the the 9200 platinum by the way
look at this layout here this is this is
very this is very similar to like a lot
of the layouts we see for the like
stripper stuff yeah that's because we
have we have a dual dies 228 core bits
of silicon on a single package giving
you that 56 412 112 thread single CPU so
very impressive but you're talking about
a 2p setup on a single package so we
have a 400 watt TDP these are gonna need
to these are gonna require there's
picture of en hey these are gonna
require he looks happy hey yeah oh yeah
I'd be happy to picture there Patrick
128 gig update module right that's
actually pretty cool too yeah 400 watt
TDP though so we're are they talking
very low frequencies overall or
extensive cooling needed first for
something like that right uh still
impressive that they're packing that
much performance onto a single chip it
will be BGA only it will sell directly
to OEMs so no you can't buy one and
build a gaming PC with it no DIY
yeah so that means they'll be soldered
directly to proprietary motherboards and
stuff like that but um yes other than
that's there's the octane stuff I'm not
gonna dive into that because obtained
can be a little bit confusing there's
there's kind of a couple different ways
it can be really implemented but octane
and the enterprise space is also pretty
exciting because you're looking at sort
of a third level of storage that's sort
of bridges the gap between system memory
and long-term storage so that's cool
what else Intel agile X a new breed of
FPGA this is this is also a little above
my head but something I read and I go
think that gooo that's cool
ten nanometer sample samples of Intel
agile X will be available in q3 I'm just
going to read a quote from the article
here so I don't screw anything up with
agile X Intel aims to offer that mix of
acceleration and configuration not only
with the core array of gates but also
the by virtue of additional chip let
extensions enable tour Intel's embedded
multi die interconnect bridge-e MIB
technology these triplets can be custom
third-party IP PCI Express 5.0 HBM 112 G
transceivers or even Intel's new compute
Express link cache coherent architecture
until is promoting up to 40 teraflops of
DSP performance and it's promoting its
use in mixed precision machine learning
with hardened support for B float16 and
integer 2 to integer each compute
performance computing I guess anyway
read the article by Ian he is a doctor
after all he knows what he's talking
about
doctor linked in the description there's
some Z&amp;amp;D stuff as well
what does agile X sound like to you
agile X it sounds like a medicinal cream
or something it's a it's FPGA we just
feel field programmable gate array gosh
no I just mean look up the name agile X
it just sounds like oh like the
competitor to KY jelly it does you're
right it sounds good
like things like a product that Shaq
would advertise agile eggs yeah right I
never leave home without it I used to I
used to get paying after I would do
sports and now I use agile Dick's it
seems like the product you'd advertise
followed by a list of symptoms like just
yeah a list of endless symptoms
sometimes may include drowsiness suicide
hey the pharmaceuticals
that's everyone present your idea isn't
you all right mm-hmm
QuakeCon 2019 Eric will hear from PC
Gamer about quakecon very popular yeah
well this one is coming later this
summer July 25th 28th in Dallas Texas is
QuakeCon 2019 and although quite con you
would think would be very quake oriented
of course lots of its software stuff is
celebrated there and this year is the
year of doom big room is celebrating its
25th anniversary damn god I'm old
quarter century yeah I know
damn it's it's loosely the 25th
anniversary cuz doom actually released
in December 1993 which is 26 years ago
but like it launched didn't round at the
end of 1993 yeah so all of 1994 yeah
when you were 2 years old or I was 6 in
94 doesn't mature Wow yeah I was 6
how old were you I wasn't 10 I was 14 14
god you guys know that's fun
I'm an old person it's okay I've
accepted it you've learned a little bit
like that's the third right a July 13 14
and 94 but doom 13 14 years old like you
guys can imagine like I played this game
a lot it was good mm-hmm it had
everything except for like pointing the
cursor up and down you know all you had
to do is left
right use your master was no up and down
yeah there was no up and down like if
the monster is up here you point here
and then it automatically will do the
vertical frame ashamed I never played Oh
ye doom yeah could you crouch
I don't like Schumann the nuts or should
get it remember the passwords iddqd and
other passwords the the cheats IBD cue
gun mode
idk FA yeah I DSP is Bo PD obvious
that's the no clipping anyway no
clipping what does that mean you can go
through walls yeah I like I'm very very
useful it'll do that and guess anymore
it's all gone downhill anyway very very
much much nostalgia yeah yeah my friends
older brother would used to like get us
and then he'd like kick our asses
because we were very new at it and he
wanted to just kick their asses in it
anyway to do a pleasure in destroying
good times and they will be celebrating
in a quick con 2019 this is fun it will
according to bethesda QuakeCon 2019 will
include all new doom inspired activities
events exclusives developed for panels
hands-on demos new information about
doom eternal and a few surprises we
aren't quite ready to talk about very
mysterious futures will be a big BYOC
area as usual hands on with bethesda
games article speculates maybe some
Wolfenstein Youngblood which is the next
entry in that series case mod swag other
stuff again July 25th to 28th in Dallas
Texas open yet they wouldn't be talking
about about it like this unless
registration was already open
registration for BYOC or the new
QuakeCon done quick pass with priority
entry to all main stage events and early
access to the exhibit hall on Saturday
will open at 10 a.m. Eastern Time on
April 11th ok so sorry so tickets go on
sale date for the for the the fancy
tickets QuakeCon done quick 10 a.m.
Eastern Time April 11th quick general
general admission entry is free so if
what quick-quick con quick con is that
what it Lake condo I'm making a joke
right gonna shorten that to quick
confident maybe if they wanted it to be
fast it's brilliant Kyle sorry I hope
some quick con quick cut it's already
turning that rain your brain can take
that and use it yeah general admission
is free so if you're if you're in the
Dallas area I'm sorry no I'm just
kidding I apologize ice-cold beer for
any Dallas residents out there I visited
Dallas at the worst possible time to
visit Dallas I was with you it was
insanely hot it was terrible so I didn't
have a good time I'm sorry other than
that I'm sure Dallas is great yeah
that's all okay one last little story
here for News this is only vaguely tech
related but do you like Skrillex I used
to listen to Skrillex years ago I know
now I do not well maybe you should again
if you go camping or something because
Skrillex could protect against mosquito
bites Kyle is that because mosquito
bites are allergic too bad this is
science according to a recent scientific
study you can avoid mosquito bites by
listening to electronic music
specifically dubstep dubstep and
specifically critics by Skrillex
according to recent results published in
the journal ACTA tropica adults of the
species aid is a gyp T aegypti which is
known as the yellow fever mosquito were
subjected to electronic music to see
whether it could work as a repellent
scary monsters and nice sprites which is
a track by Skrillex familiar with it was
chosen because of its mix of very high
and very low frequencies the results
were that female adult mosquitoes were
entertained by the track and impact
hosts later and less often than those in
a dubstep free environment Wow so
they're just like getting high off of
Skrillex loose music it's a natural high
I mean I mean yeah high on life high on
Skrillex so you don't need to be like
this dude with all this nasty fumigation
yeah I think it a Bluetooth speaker he'd
be sets is apparently yeah you know down
to the speaker pump some Skrillex yeah
look it's it's April now a lot of you
may be looking forward to making some
plans
for the summer what's what can kill you
know a nice enjoyable evening by the
lake or what not then like a swarm of
mosquitoes yeah you know just play some
Skrillex and you know maybe you could
sync it up with like noise cancelling
headphones so you didn't have to
actually have to hear it as well if you
didn't enjoy the Skrillex I guess
there'll be that could that could be an
option night otherwise your skin would
be safe but your ears would be bleeding
now there's a downsell downside to this
and i don't know if this bleeds over to
human let me guess you have to listen to
Skrillex No well that's already been
kind of recovering but I don't want to
shit talks guys I I haven't heard
anything new from Skrillex in like five
years
but when he was hot and he was like the
ninja of music at the time my friends
and I listened to him all the time you
know the dubstep me we just played beer
pong - Skrillex and stuff which also
explains why we never got bit by
mosquitoes
see you guys knew this way back then
could have saved them a lot of research
time and stuff like that but we could
have been this article but getting back
to the downside potential downside here
and this is only if seems to have
affected the mosquitoes but I'm not sure
how this might affect humans as well
mosquitoes exposed to the song had sex
far less often than mosquitoes without
the music but so I need someone to
double like double down on this
experiment is this real it's an article
from a second opinion the BBC this is
this a visit reputable oh it just sounds
so ridiculous accent it sounds like an
article hey listen to somebody speak
with an English accent not because that
person obviously knows what they're
talking about oh my god this is cockney
then you'd be like oh that's that's oh
oh it's Brad Pitt and he's about to get
in a fight with a pikey that's PI key
being completely different things
it's almost our English viewers are
probably very good no no cockney is just
so it's like so that's so congenial like
I like this person that's those are your
two options when hearing safe an English
accent received me as an American person
sure so yeah Skrillex keeps the
mosquitoes away maybe less sex that's
the TLDR for that one
wait so Skrillex not only prevents you
from getting bit but it also prevents
mosquitoes from multiplying yeah I guess
yeah look at that way can we do it sorry
I gonna start selling Skrillex in the
can
you just spray Skrillex on your body
it's there just like a Bluetooth speaker
with Skrillex music pre-loaded onto it
you just push it in the place hang it
from your thing the ultimate miss Brooke
Holland I remember a week cuz we I would
always go on the dough with a deep 100
stuff you just have to maximum oh yeah
chemical concoction right to prevent the
mosquitoes yeah deep 100 you know I
don't know if it's toxic or what
everybody keeps the mosquitoes away
that's the important thing
no then you have lots of people who do
like Tran these other things like the
little little thing that supposedly
emitted some frequency or something kept
it yeah so it's all garbage
Skrillex no it sounds nothing like a
Skrillex Skrillex solid that's all in
science right thing okay movin up
time for some sword fight or fight it's
been a while since we had a good sword
fight in here so we have a couple
questions here today we're gonna go for
okay in case you guys are familiar
certified long long-running segment here
on an awesome hardware we bring up a
controversial subject controversial
topic Kyle and I will take opposing
sides to that subject we will argue our
sides we also have a straw poll which we
invite you guys to participate in feel
free to just you know vote with your
heart in the straw poll or you know wait
to hear our arguments and then let that
sway your opinion
we are influential it we are your
influences apparently but it's up to you
but this one actually has a bit of
backstory here and that's a borderlands
3 Caillou play borderlands right I
played Borderlands 2 some borderline I -
I beat Borderlands 2 with some friends
has fun just a very entertaining game
absolutely and a game money that a
sequel launching for I'd be like I would
play that because I remember enjoying
write the last version of it right bit
of news here potentially Borderlands 3
will be annex an epic store exclusive
Oh screw it I'm never gonna play it
again well ever again
might be deal-breaker epic stories I
have to launch a different app to play
the game rather than rather than steam
I'll forego 50 hours of joyous glorious
gameplay now of course is this article
is that stupid app hmm
obviously you save time time save that's
very important I'm just kidding that's
what my video earlier today was all
about I saw it thank you
nothing's confirmed 100% at this point
but it really does look like it's gonna
be epic store exclusive first off Randy
Pitchford
who's what does he do he's dude he's
dude he's the dude he's a box a gearbox
a developer he made some comments but
let's talk about where this originally
came from the borderlands Twitter
account tweeted and included a video
they deleted the tweet pretty quickly
it seemed like maybe it was a schedule
one that some or something that fired
off at the wrong time specifically
though said coming September 13th so
that's the first part of this I guess if
you are interested in Borderlands 3 and
the potential launch date of it does
seem like we're looking at a September
13 launch because this was from the
official account quickly deleted but
usually that means like oops right I
can't see them I don't know maybe
they're trying to throw shade you never
know
comforters can do something like that
too but right seems somewhat reasonable
September 13th Janeway off yeah it's a
while off but then looking more closely
at the video attached we can see this
screen cap right here which which is
gone now which is very useful come on
Mario 64 and then you see if I can open
this another window so someone is
alright so see you down here in the
lower left corner right this is the
developer do you can distribute your
publisher this is the store Epic Games
you might notice there's no mention of a
steam steam or other platforms there ah
so yeah and and just just that be just
this being what seems to be a pretty
official trailer right and there being
no other mention of any other store on
there right that's kind of that's kind
of
well you know that's what happens I
guess that's what happens when your
platform lands the biggest and most
popular game in the world which is
fortnight well I think these developers
just won't like yeah sure I'll sign the
deal exclusive all this bullshit yep
there's certain platforms who have pain
who have gained a lot of users on the
platform due to the success of a single
franchise right like a like a fortnight
or a DNA fix any pics legends yeah or
whatever so any developer that owns that
platform or just their publisher
whatever who owns that platform they're
gonna look for longevity they want other
tables to come on there so I have any
exclusive is a great way to force people
to do that because it's the only way
they can play that game and got the
funds to make it happen following up to
that Randy Pitchford who again is the
CEO I guess I don't know if that's his
official title the boss of gearbox his
response take-two has exclusive
publishing rights for Borderlands 3 and
makes all decisions regarding price
points territories distribution and
platform partnerships please direct all
inquiry inquiries regarding any of these
topics to 2k we are just the talents as
a customer I'm happy to shop in
different stores already do I've bought
games from Xbox Playstation switch theme
origin GOG humble up you play epic
another source to me exclusives are fine
when they come with advantages and when
they're short say six months ah that's
two this conversation on Twitter where
is the third and for what it's worth to
Kay's decisions aside myself and the
team at gearbox have a very keen
interest in cross-platform play we
believe multi-platform support is a
prerequisite and epics leadership with
cross-platform support is helpful to our
interests here so he made some
reassuring he made several points there
none of the points were saying this is
not epic epic exclusive so that right he
L somebody else I made some points and
that's what we're gonna argue about
right yeah is this okay so guys will
post us in and chat and everything in
the straw poll please please vote is
is it okay for Borderlands three to be
epic exclusive what and and we get we
got two options we got your EA and your
nay mm-hmm
got a third option there too for those
who are interested I'm posting this wait
shad stuffy there's a tough it is tough
so you you you have to choose okay one
side or the other can okay okay I'm
gonna say yes it's okay it's okay it's
okay
okay I've got Steam for some games I've
got you play for no games got origin for
a couple and fuck it let's do a pic for
a couple games games are all that matter
the platform matters to a degree but I
will I will I will sacrifice having to
open up a shitty platform or even a
platform from a company who I don't 100%
agree with if the game is good okay at
the end of the day it's about the game
and also I have like five apps for
fucking RGB so why can't I have more
than one or two apps for a goddamn game
I don't I don't see it I don't I'll live
with it I'll live it I'll live another
day I'll be fine I'll move on with my
life die heavy person I'll be fine yeah
corporate response maybe not quite as
super corporate maybe not quite as
sugar-coated as response but that's the
corporate response if they were to not
give a fucking juice were just telling
ya alright so I obviously got I
obviously will take the position of no
the epic store is lacking many of the
futures of other platforms particularly
steam having a choice and where to buy
is always better as as Randy already
mentioned Randy Randy Pitchford mmm-hmm
he purchases from many different
platforms
and when it comes to like like
capitalism like capitalism for what it's
worth has its pros and it's cons right
but if you want to look at that at the
fundamental thing the capitalism is
supposed to get right it's supposed to
provide choice for the consumer and that
choice is supposed to create competition
between the various choices and the
virtue of that competition between the
various locations where you might
purchase a product or buy a game means
that all those different sources or
platforms continually try to one-up each
other to improve themselves and that
benefits the consumer because you have a
bunch choices and those choices
continually try to differentiate
themselves by making themselves better
now I'm gonna cheat here because I have
no no qualms doing so chan scrolling
down some of the responses this is a
this is kind of a slightly biased image
here but I only bring it up because it's
pointing out many of the benefits of the
steam platform in particular cloud saves
families sharing Linux support mod
hosting and home streaming achievements
user reviews big picture mode
leaderboard Universal controller support
community guides a linear and limited
refunds VRS support custom profiles
external cue sales cloud screenshots
friend activity Island activity I
haven't doubled much in the epic store
when it comes to that so yeah and like I
said I'm cheating a little bit and this
is just like a picture that somebody put
together online I'm mainly bringing it
up to point out that there's a lot of
stuff that the epic store does not
currently have steam benefits in many
ways from being a platform that has
existed for a very long time and has
evolved over time again kind of in the
same way I talked about earlier to
provide more services to customers so by
making this an epic store exclusive you
might say like well it doesn't matter it
means you're buying it from point A
instead of point B you're missing out
potentially on a bunch of extra cool
stuff that could be available alongside
the game with steam that you no longer
have access to because it's the epic
store but hey at least you can you know
chat with your Fortnight friends
suppose right yeah Alice that's great
let's just let's team have all the games
all the time so that inevitably when one
day Gabe Newell dies and it's taken over
by some fucking tyrannical leader and
all we have and there's no obvious great
alternative and that is completely
fucked that is the best and a very good
answer to that because I and and I'm
going outside of the this Q&amp;amp;A here so as
but steam being a monolithic single
source for all games and everything it's
also a bad thing in time so I flipped it
all backwards there but you know it's
it's good to try to stay take a step
back and look at things from different
perspectives that indeed this is about
let's see what the results are
we have no all right we have a pretty
pretty strong showing for yes though an
ident that is going back to that last
thing we're saying like we we we want
some competition and I think that's the
confusing thing there's also sixty
sixteen percent of people who regularly
pee their pants
rather than showering it's a that's
probably concerning its I mean hygiene I
think is important you guys saw at the I
think you should this warrants further
research consider that as a long-term
approach may be occasionally mix it up
so I'm saying
but anyway 34% of people roughly a third
think that it's it's a good thing to
some extent so I that it's it's this is
like the reason I brought it up today
was like intramural I a hard I don't
have a single direct answer to this
myself yeah it is kind of frustrating to
be forced to use Depok store to get
Borderlands three I would like to see
more choice in the game platforms I get
kind of irritated when suddenly I have
to install four or five different
platforms on new PC to access the
different gifts suddenly it becomes too
sure so I don't know I don't know where
the sort of balance point is in between
there between having a few like three
there should be three
but don't you also like having different
brands of products in your house like
different appliances like having an
appliance from Samsung that works really
great as a fridge but Alliance from
whoever that works really great as a
stove but I guess isn't it kind of the
same thing I guess in my house I don't
have the thing with like like
applications that automatically start
when I boot up my house and that run in
the background using up my houses
background resources you can't disable
that I mean can't you just you can't
disable that not to start up on Windows
but with me it's more of a frustration
because I build lots of different
computers to test stuff and I know
that's a more unique problem but it's
irritating to have to go and do all
those different installations of the
different platforms on the different
computers and do that every time if I
were if I don't want in the Auto Start
so so yeah three I think there should be
three that's that's my three I want
three I want to steam and two other good
one two others that are good sure we'll
keep pouring that around it may be that
all kind of battle it out on on a
roughly level landscape that's that's
like enough diversity to keep each other
honest yeah without being like oh shit I
gotta install five different six
different clients in a weird way are you
almost kind of excited because all of
these new platforms emerging on PC means
growth for the PC platform yes
in a sense you're like whoa like there's
a lot of big more money being interested
in PC yes there's more competition in PC
hey we're have more their sites are on
PC more than ever I've had a bunch of
people respond to my how to build series
and say like hey I built this system
I've had a lot of father-son kind of
combos yeah sweet which is awesome I
love getting that yeah and it's like hey
here's my son computer just set up he's
loading up and it's him with fortnight
loading and I'm like I see I understand
that but that makes sense yeah you know
if they played on a console or whatever
or if they're all their friends play or
something you know that's a that's a
that's a call the gateway drug yeah
point being this remains an open subject
and I think will come probably come back
to in the future there as well here's
the next question we're gonna try to go
through this one a little bit more quick
but this one's a age-old question when
it comes to computers and we're just
talking in cell versus AMD so we're
talking CPU side here okay in case you
want to be more specific Intel versus
AMD people got to make this choice all
the time on a daily basis especially if
you're building for the first time or if
you're building for the first time in a
while what do we think right now we we
have a wide variety of choices from both
manufacturers and you know there's pros
and cons I think on either side so this
is this is yet again well I'm trying not
to lean it one way or the other so thank
you for posting the links in chat by the
way seller moderator we love him thank
you Matt so yeah I would first last time
so you went first last time
right I you at first last time and I
feel like you picked the more
controversial choice I'm you're the same
thing I'm gonna go Intel okay
Intel you can't beat the fastest now
here's my reasoning first off our
content deals primarily with building
your own computer I think if you're
gonna build your own computer right now
it's there's a good chance you're
building your own computer to play video
games because there's lots of choices
for accessing the internet and browsing
the web and getting stuff done without
necessarily building a full on desktop
building that to play games is gonna be
where it's at when it comes to playing
games if you want to get the most out of
the graphics card that you choose in all
circumstances particularly in lower
resolution circumstances
you're gonna want Intel that has the
best best single core performance best
single core performance which in the
vast majority of scenarios equals the
best performance out of your graphics
card in situations where everything else
is equal and you have an Intel processor
and an AMD processor the
we'll be more likelihood that you will
get less performance out of the graphics
card with the AMD processor than you
would with the Intel and yes it costs a
little bit more sure fewer bucks - more
button but you know who wants to have
the fastest processor out there if
everyone can also afford it now you know
you need some barriers to entry you need
you need you need you need a bit of a
gated community for the true enthusiasts
out there who let's face it just a
little bit better than everyone else
because of the processing performance of
their their computer that's that that's
what it boils down to I I appreciate the
satiric satirical response so that no
matter what the results are you can't
lose so I obviously have to say AMD
because I mean it blows Intel out of the
water when it comes to as mentioned in
the straw poll priced performance right
and as Paul said you do you do make the
most of your GPU when you go Intel right
it allows it to breathe a bit more than
with an AMD counterpart but like all
like Paul also mentioned that's
particularly more effective at lower
resolutions so let's say 1080p being the
most common resolution that people are
gaming at are you really gonna spend 5 X
3 X 2 X even 2 X amount more on a CPU to
get more frames per second at 1080p when
you could just when you could easily
just save a bunch of money put it more
towards your GPU right the money that
you would save on a rise in CPU versus
buying an equivalent Intel CPU at the
moment oh my god you could put that
towards your GPU and since games are
more or less GPU dependent these days as
they have been for quite some time that
would benefit you a lot more in the long
run if your primary task is gaming if we
were arguing this on maybe say in video
editing plat plane then I think
things would be different but I don't
think I need to really argue this any
further because I think I win do you do
you and you all know you all know I'm
right
you all know I'm right such confidence
and if I lose in the straw poll it's
because you're all trolling hey here we
go telling you
AMD woohoo and who even in the hole even
a bigger differential there from the
last animation Apple right so wow so
Intel it's a lesson lesson to be learned
here any Intel rips what to hear just
move the camera maybe slightly that's
fine 16 people any because any Intel
reps watching right now just just lower
your prices slightly just just make it
you don't have to you don't have to
match
AMD yeah just you know they're faster
they don't need to be the same print you
could be more expensive just drop it a
bit like it's just we're not asking for
him here so it's so weird when you can
get a 6 core 6 thread MD processor which
you can overclock to be within a
percentage point of any six core 6
thread AMD process Explorer 12 thread
I'm sorry and processor right and the
nearest Intel 6 core 12 thread processor
to compare it to knitly morgs is the
8700 k if you want to go unlocked yeah
so you can overclock it like a name like
any which is 300 and 360 $370
yeah that's 200 bucks more yeah that's
right that's a lot of money you think
that's a hard that's a hard sell for
somebody who's like like what's the real
difference like well if you get a really
high-end graphics card and you play at
1080 and you turn the settings down yeah
you probably would get like 10 or 20
more frames per second on that like what
yeah yeah it goes from like a hundred
and 60 FPS 180 with the Intel right and
you're like my monitor is 60 Hertz yeah
and it's and it's and it's 2560 by 1440
right like oh well there's no difference
at that resolution Oh
so why should I spend 200 bucks more
exactly yeah I feel like wouldn't rise
when first gen rise in first
launched it would have been fine hey
Intel could still charge the prices that
they're charging now because AMD had
such a bad rap and reputation at the
time for just being infinitely slower
than Anna worse deal than any Intel
chips but it's been two years since then
and people have caught on even people
who don't really know pcs or PC hardware
or who aren't as enthusiastic about you
know PC DIY as we are know by now two
years down the line after rising first
debuted that it's a really good it's a
really good value and an Intel needs to
scale their prices accordingly which
they haven't they're still charging for
their chips like they were still as if
they were still the king of value back
then so or as if AMD's products were
somehow hamstrung which you could make
the argument for back in the in the the
bulldozer and days and their past
generation of stuff which launched like
five years before isin but it's really
not the case anymore hey guys that is
all I got from my half of the show so
thank you all so much for watching and
if anyone wants to do timestamps we
greatly appreciate that your everyday
tech has been doing those really really
many thanks for that I'll pin those
again we're going to continue the
debauchery in the after party yep which
is linked in the description it's gonna
be super casual and fun so join us there
if you want and then yeah and then we'll
do a twitch rate at the end so you guys
could get to all bombard a random twitch
channel be super fun alright so we'll
see you there if you're on twitch stay
right where you at if you're on youtube
links in the description thanks for
watching guys thumbs up button anyway
ups we'll see you briefly boy shortly
