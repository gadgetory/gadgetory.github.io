though it's October in Southern
California it was over a hundred degrees
outside which means I can't do any work
in my garage I still wanted to get some
stuff done though and I decided that
instead of choosing one thing to do
maybe I should just try to do everything
so here is a time lapse of me trying to
do everything starting of course was
playing with the dog next up I decided
to pull out one of the products that I
need to do little video on it that is
the antec edge 650 watt power supply so
here's a look at me doing some of my
b-roll for that getting close-up footage
I'm just using one of my softbox lights
as well as the light coming in from
outside and I'm just setting everything
up on the kitchen table like I have been
doing for a lot of the summer since been
so warm outside now behind me there's
also a workstation setup it's kind of a
bunch of clutter on the table a bunch of
clutter all around as you can see I have
a lot of products that have come in and
last week or two my goal here is to get
set up so that I can actually also start
doing some benchmarking on that test bed
behind me but i also have a new monitor
that just arrived i had set it up for
some quick testing the night before but
now i'm going to do some b-roll of that
as well you can already tell it's from
monoprice it's a 28 inch 4k monitor
really excited because it's my first 4k
monitor really and also it's a pretty
cool monitor I think you guys are going
to like it I really like it so far the
stands is in a really good job and the
picture at least so far is pretty there
are no dead pixels or anything like that
one downfall is that it's got a glossy
screen but i think i'll be able to deal
with it but of course the main thing is
that it's going to allow me to do 4k
benchmarks now I started this time lapse
up already kind of late in the afternoon
and at this point it is getting a little
bit on into the evening you might be
seeing the lights starting to fade
outside which means it's almost time to
take a break fortunately I was able to
finish up the monoprice 4k 20
inch monitor but now comes a break for
day so I'm just finishing up filming the
monoprice monitor but if you guys are
curious how I'm doing my time-lapse
today I have a laptop down here it's
wired up to a webcam so logitech c920
with with the c-clamp and that's up on
the wall and that is how I am
that much with myself today after dinner
comes the fun stuff so i finished the
filming I wanted to do for today I mean
there's more I can always do but I got
to move on so the first thing I'm doing
is getting that gtx 980 from EVGA set up
on the test bench back there in the back
it is the EVGA geforce gtx 980 per clock
edition featuring their AC x 2 point 0
cooler very excited to see how well this
one performs at the same time though i'm
going to try to do a bunch of other
things so i have an htpc build coming up
i'm going to be doing that on an old
standby that's the Maximus 5 gene
motherboard haven't booted it for a
while though so i need to get it updated
and i'm going to transfer it to a new
SSD also i have the intel pentium
anniversary edition that I just got and
I'm going to be testing that and
overclocking it I'm going to be using
the asus z87 motherboard for that but I
need to get the bios update the same
time also on my laptop i'm downloading
the windows 10 technical preview and the
benchmarks are still going of course in
the background so it's this this is
awesome i love doing this kind of thing
i really hope you guys enjoyed watching
this this was just a little bit of a
taste of what I did on my Saturday I
hope you guys had a great saturday to
let me know which of all these projects
you're most excited to see maybe I'll
work on that one first CL later guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
