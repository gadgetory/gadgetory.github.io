Paul just rolls around with a canister a
thermos of vodka it's using water for
sale Oh cleansed Vince :
oh you should be like that hi Hey whoa
awesome hardware this is a show it's a
live show
it's a live show we are live right now
we will talk about technology computers
other random stuff we try to have a good
time
sometimes we succeed so thank you for
joining us if you're watching us live
you might be doing that on YouTube on my
channel Paul's hardware or you might be
doing that on twitch twitch TV slash /
awesome hardware that works due to both
at the same time through the magic of
technology options we like we like
options and about half an hour 40
minutes we'll switch to Kyle's half
second half on YouTube that will be on
his channel which is linked in the
description if you also want to help
support our channels then you can check
out our stores quick plug for those my
store is at Paul's Harbor net or I have
shirts mugs fun glasses and other
high-quality things
oh that geez look sorry what happened I
was it was overlapping xsplit you could
see xsplit in the stream is very
unprofessional
oh god it's fixed now we are pals we got
thumb screw polo shirts back in stock if
you guys are looking for those if you
need something to wear in a professional
environment that still says I like
Paul's hardware then get one of it here
they are professional classy stylish
exactly all selecta also at Kyle's store
you can buy merchandise bit weight that
tech slash store yep it's also real nice
it all comes from the same place feel
free to order from both stores if you
want and it will ship together to get a
shipping discount if you buy stuff we'll
give you a shout out at the end of the
show when we do Johnson's it's a great
tradition Treaty of traditions we
typically drink a beer on the show today
we're drinking very special beer plenty
of the elder also a quick word of
warning we occasionally use adult
language so leave if you don't like that
yes
that's all for the introductory part run
for the hills I'm gonna I'm gonna pass
cow the ceremonial
oh wait thank you Paul he can work on
that I've looked forward to this all
week you saved it like you've had it for
a while and I've had it I saw I spotted
in my fridge Sunday when is when my mom
dropped it off and I've been anxiously
awaiting this moment
well that's extense highest switch did
you know did you know they use the you
probably already knew this but did you
know they they use the sound of a beer
bottle being opened for the overwatch
sound effect when you hit someone oh
yeah yeah yeah because it's supposed to
be satisfying yes oddly so it's very
very satisfying especially when its beer
I'll play some overwatch on Kyle's ham
yes we are gonna exactly yeah totally
yeah that was a great transition there
good plug that's good all right thanks
ship here take show it's organized
professional all right to the nth degree
oh you're right here you can have sorry
I'm gonna put some I'm gonna leave here
you can have some of mine bring a little
glass over here the wife the wife gets
them as well can't have any of my weight
that's that's that's my glass or no is
that your glass I don't know they're
both the same okay all right to do if
you don't mind cooties
okay even yeah it's roughly even all
right so just just take the bottle
Heather his gum and just take the bottle
and ER of the plenty of the elders
what's with the angered deaths face
second time I've done this man pliny the
elder's it's like I love marriage it's
like a MacGuffin in a film or something
it's like that thing that everyone
desires the cousin Lagasse's causes all
the conflict and everything yes it's
it's the diamond didn't snatch yeah
exactly like maybe I'll be resenting
Kyle secretly for the rest of the show
because he poured me slightly less Pliny
the Elder than he got or the rest of my
life or
for all time this will all come back to
haunt me in episode 535 oh yes that's
all we've we've been weaving this
narrative through past episodes of
awesome Harger yeah if you look at it
the third one you'll see the easter-egg
star drum it's a really intricate
writing on the shows the phrase we don't
get more credit
way better than Game of Thrones
absolutely all right I digress
as Jay likes to say things are horrible
Oh
we've been focused so much on the Easter
eggs and writing of the show that we've
hashtag on all about production hashtag
blame Kyle know what cuz you can't you
use do you run over the awesome hardware
and yes that is church hasn't been up
there I was frantic okay so there's a
time-sensitive stream had enough time to
start fresh it was good I had to hurry
open pillage that's the existing
presentation news well let's Cheers with
our wine eating lots of planning it's
like a thousand angels had an orgasm and
all that juice mmm this filtered into
separate reeking angel jizz
well I specified it's just your juice
whether I mean how do I get into angel
morphology or anything like that but I
need plenty is these the elder who has
married Wow at least twenty twenty of
the delicious appear angels alright
speaking of delicious check it out this
is all going so well it's it really
trying to keep up the facade that we
have it that we know alright check it
out guys Sony has a new camera
well I bring this up because I wanted
vaguely I don't know I have th 5s right
now and I get jealous of the a7 a the
mark 3 yeah cuz no they are frame
sensors are beautiful when it comes to
digital photography and videography
there's no more fundamental I think part
of the camera than the sensor itself and
of course bigger the better the bigger
those are the things that can make
sensors
better than others yep this one for the
a7 are alpha 7 our mark for from Sony is
a full-frame 61 megapixel sensor that
they have in this really relatively
small body camera here is the video play
play part of it
$10,000 yes some specs for you guys
burst speed of up to 10 FPS that's for
photography 15 stops of dynamic range it
features a brand-new full-frame BSI CMOS
image sensor the this weight was quote
here and I don't know what video idea
can you game on a camera what can you
gain can you get my camera my camera yes
it has AI built into it there you go
like it loses AI first search if you
have a bunch of pictures you can tell
look at look for this face or something
and then it will tell you oh like type
it in like look for keidel that's its
this is all from the article so I'm not
exactly how that works I assume it all
works perfectly though seamlessly and
exactly like they say and of course
let's do all advertisements this fancy
sensor is an evolution of Sony's built
in since none are outside the sensor in
and of itself 60 megapixels pixels which
is huge huge there's also a bunch of
stuff in the article about using it in
photos at the crop down mode aps-c mode
which is it which is a smaller format
for a it's a long line with full frame
and it comes to the image sensor size
sensor sizes boy being it has something
called a multi shot mode sensor shift
multi shot mode that can create a 240
megapixel image from 16 separate pixel
shifted images containing a swivel of 96
960 3.2 million pixels of data so like
it does it say I hash tag AI that's all
you know there's a eyes in it and it's
doing everything and it's better than
your camera hey I get bigger yes AI is a
such a buzzword nowadays that is true so
there there's some pictures of it has
567 phase detection autofocus points
covering 74 percent of the image area
that also means that when you use it in
FSC mode it covers 100% of the area
although again you're copying down your
sensor which is why would you do that
no those use cases for that sure
real-time tracking autofocus real time I
autofocus actually this is shown in the
video better so me
some of the autofocus images I mean
they're they're just simulations or
whatever but like let's talk about the
autofocus points and it does animal
autofocus autofocus like if you have a
dog or not or if you have a cheetah yeah
you know you can use it for that this is
that AI recognition so like oh I like
this person look at them and then search
through all my pictures and this is
color and pattern data that is that's
kind of like a creeper feature you know
there's a like alright find all the
pictures of Sally that I took through
her window yes he's very sad it saves a
bunch of time very Silence of the Lambs
okay I gotta focus that's a visa by the
way Vizsla is the name of the dog that's
the breed of dog
yeah is it gorgeous done my sister used
to these look very pretty can was Jesse
a nice coat it's got this new shoe mount
which can has multi functions but it's
got this mic that goes on top the mic is
digital but then it provides akamai cos
analog of first when most fires where
it's picks up the audio but then it has
a full digital connection to the camera
itself so it doesn't seem to require
like it battery no that's a soft mount
one of the Oh dead cat or a phone no you
don't wanna know the shock shot shot
Matt writes what it's called yeah
yes remembering my words nice so yeah
that's kind of fun Oh interesting okay I
hate I hate the flip up cameras though
because I don't really flip up so that
you can do selfie mode when you're
recording video like if you're vlogging
or something which I've I feel like it's
a deal breaker for me for how I shoot my
videos I feel like I'd really clip up
high enough it's it's great for the
aurochs rx100 because it's small enough
they small enough it goes over them but
the viewfinder blocks the screen so you
could really only shoot get like low
angles but you can actually turn around
180 if you flipped to the side like the
70d or something like that it's better
for selfie selfie doing selfie things
it's just it sounds like a really stupid
deal-breaker like what it's an amazing
camera but I feel like for someone like
me
that that is very important you know it
obviously depends on the user but I
can't see what I'm shooting if I'm
shooting myself or something behind me
it's that's true it's hard to say you
could you could mount like in an LCD to
it or something but that would be very
heavy to carry all that right now
one-handed as you selfie video to
yourself yeah well that's another power
source people's so yeah I mean obviously
not for everyone but but it's very mike
is the ECM b1m anyway other features
just around the mark real quick
dual ultra high speed 2 SD card slots
enhanced weather sealing and ultra high
resolution five point seven six million
dot electronic viewfinder USB type-c for
tethering fast built-in Wi-Fi with
support for wireless tethering five
point five stops five axis in body image
stabilization as well as they refined
button layout for for easier autofocus
control and a deeper grip which
apparently people have been requesting
compared to the other version of ACE
them mark three this is coming in
September and it's already available for
pre-order for $3,500 $3,500 alright
you're pre-ordering I don't know should
I fear how much better is it gonna be
then ugh for or ugh five yeah it's gonna
be $3500 I think I got either I don't do
fancy candy here my fancy lighting and
stuff yeah
precise focus and all that kind of stuff
know my qualities been garbage lately I
love it because who cares it's you it's
for the web it doesn't yeah you know and
you're just like like I have it I feel
like people treat that that like
videography it's like like oh if you
don't do that and then then then you
suck and that's wrong yeah I was I was
gonna say more there but I felt I got
half way into that sentence it I was
like I need to cut this off so I just
said it my shirt
alright point being cool camera I need
to decide whether or not to drop 3500
bucks on a pre-order
leaning towards no but I don't know I
don't know I have a question how come
pre-ordering a camera before reviews are
out is something that you're considering
whereas pre-ordering say a cpu before
user out is clearly shunned upon and
just not even an option worth
considering
I kept my deep core my being there is
there a difference I don't I don't want
to say that I'm special but I into are
special but you are spending a special
flower I'm unique no okay I will I will
I will put forward that for some people
who create coverage of tech content with
youtubers like us or otherwise there
might be a bit more of an incentive to
preorder because whether or not the
product sucks or doesn't suck you're
gonna be one of the first to get it and
you know do a review on it or something
like that and there might be added value
in that mm-hmm and you can also look at
it like as like like I'm making a
sacrifice I'm taking one for the team
sure you know what if it does suck but I
dropped the thirty five hundred bucks
right get that right off the bat and
then I come out and be like guys this
sucks right then you know I'm doing a
service to everyone out there to the
community yeah and you're trying to very
nope you're trying to talk me out of
that why why are you such a dick to all
the people who are watching this show
right now Pat I'm fine okay
some apologize so what you're saying is
to all the people out there I like very
manipulative you make a great politician
beard back your head it tells a dick you
put the pollen politician so what you're
saying is the people out there who are
saying like never pre-order anything
you're basically telling them that in
your own words and I've heard you quote
this before
is to never speak in absolutes that's
true you never speak in absolutes no I
always say that I never do okay let's
move up all right we got some more tech
stuff uh be 450 and X 470 motherboards
existing 400 series mother
for AMD Rison series processors are
still very viable for lots of people
because you can find good deals on them
and they're perfectly functional if you
don't need PCI Express Gen 4 you can
drop a rise at 3000 series processor
into it and get the vast majority of the
benefits that the new processors offer
when it comes to IPC improvements in
speed and more cores and all that good
stuff without having to necessarily
upgrade to one of the very much more
expensive X 570 motherboards but could
you have your cake and eat it too
and still get PCI Express Gen 4 on a B
450 and x4 70 motherboard you can
actually discuss its multiple times on
the show because it's been speculated
about and there were early biases that
had the option in it and there's a
little bit more on this today it's both
good news and bad the good news is that
yes asus in fact and i'm gonna scroll
past this here to this screenshot this
was posted originally on the chinese
media site and my drivers and this is
apparently directly from asus a list of
their existing motherboards and the
support that they offer for PCI Express
Gen 4 are those PlayStation controller
symbols I don't know why they went with
this strange text triangle circle for
what it does support it literally has
all the same symbols based completely
awkward a bit the point being why China
hardware fortunately has taken that on
put it on a nice check here that makes a
little bit easier to read so the point
being this does seem to be a legitimate
source that we're not verified or
anything so this is still kind of in the
realm of you know rumor and stuff but
this this all seems pretty legit to me
looking at it ASIS apparently went and
tested and validated PCI Express 4.0
functionality on there pretty much the
entire x4 7 a and B 450 line up and they
found that they were able to say that
yes PCI Express Gen 4 works on quite a
quite a few of them the weird thing is
that the higher end motherboards have
less support right X more 70s at the top
here the only support that you get is
going to be in the top PCI Express
by 16 slot and then the n dot 2 slot
that's wired directly to the CPU not
through the chipset right so if you look
at all the exports 70s here the best you
can get is a buy eight support and
that's not even on the high-end ones the
crosshair seven here on Wi-Fi were the
most expensive expert seventy boards
they have zero support and they've got
by four they do have support for the m
dot two slot uh yeah you know I'm not
really sure do you think that's just
coming later or that that's never gonna
be an option on those boards because it
doesn't seem like there's a reason why
website alright so to be clear and to
jump ahead because I want to I want to
look at this list but let's just jump
ahead Andy well a lot of them new sites
kind of we're discussing this and AMD
has come out and said yes this might
exist right now for some of these early
BIOS versions or early gen for the Gen 4
support but it is not officially
supported by AMD the quote from the
article is that AMD hasn't completely
blocked out the functionality yet but
users should expect this option to be
disabled when final retail biases are
released so we're going to have a
situation where yes there are a few
existing older BIOS versions that you
could load up and get Gen 4 support on a
400 series motherboard but you're not
going to see new BIOS versions or
official BIOS version supporting that
supporting it so if you want support for
the latest at Jason cook edge ISA code
for your for your 8000 series processor
updated support for memory or other
stuff and there's been a pretty decent
amount of sort of extra sauce added to
the platform like if you look at the
rise and stuff with early version
viruses with later ones so in my mind
this is gonna become kind of a niche
thing I was trying to figure out what
use case this might have and I'm like
because because you don't really need
gen 4 for like graphics yeah but this
was something that unlocked some you
know more cores of threads on your CPU
or some massive improvements and
graphics performance or something like
that I can see people going with these
older bios's in order to take advantage
of that but here I feel like we remain
we might have some edge cases like I
don't know someone trying to trying to
put together
a super budgets but really fast storage
server or something like that mm-hmm
so you get like one of the new 3000
series ap use yeah
and that has Gen 4 support right and use
it with like a cheap be 450 motherboard
yeah and and for the by 16 slight put
like a riser card withwith MDOT two
drives in it I don't sure like that or
like a really high-end like like a
budget high-end editing system like if
you were let's say in college and you
were limited on cash flow but you were
trying to do like an 8k independent film
for your senior thesis or something like
that maybe maybe PCI Gen 4 is something
that you need but you don't have the
cash flow to spend on like a super
high-end build maybe there's a
possibility there because that was one
of the demos that AMD showed us as to
the the benefit of PCI Gen 4 is with an
8k editing workflow I don't know the
details of how that was tested or their
testing methodology that the interesting
to find out but it seems like superfast
storage needs are one of the main
focuses for PCI gen for right now until
until GPUs can actually leverage more
bandwidth and and there's a lot fewer
people who are looking for that you know
what yeah okay it's super slim it's it's
still an interesting thing to look at I
don't know if anyone's gonna try to grab
some of these bugs that's the other
thing I don't know which BIOS versions
you'd need to enable this or if they're
available publicly or anything like that
but just to just to run down the list if
you want to look at the b4 15
motherboards there are quite a few that
have by 16 support in the top PCIe slot
and by for support in the m dot 2 slot
and the funny thing is a lot of them are
further down the product stack like that
it's just kind of weird to me it's not
what I would expect but yeah I think a
lot of this boils down to like trace
layouts for the connections between the
CPU and the slot itself and how long
they are and other than that I don't
know it's like it's so good alright just
wanted to share that with you guys kind
of an unique interesting little inch
case for the new horizon
3000 series processors and let's move on
we have a mini like like hot heavy
hardware here just a couple of product
launches that you may or may not be
interested in g-scale has enough to
their Trident Z Nero neo non 0 0 neo
ddr4 memory yes
specifically aimed at rise in 3000 and
x5 70 series and here's some pictures of
I saw these this was the like one of the
very few things I was actually
interested in at the g.skill booth at
Computex this year and they had hardly
any information on it other than it's
gonna be targeted at rise in 3000 and
and do you like the way it looks I was
like well it's kinda like the old one
you know the existing strategy RGB
except it's got sort of like a different
design on that the grey area like here
yeah it's just a different texture on
this spot right here where everything
else seems exactly the same except that
it says neo at copy text they were
fiddling around with different plate
colors like they had red and blue and I
told them no I just looked at them as I
think was way or someone I was like no
all right no don't that's your fault
don't do it and and so far all the
marketing images and photos that have
been coming out the renders of these
sticks have been color neutral it seems
to be the only design solvent that they
have at this point so am i doing you're
welcome anyway there's some more
screenshots here's here's the actual
list of kits that they are coming out
with and these are higher frequency kits
2666 speed up to 3,600 3,600 is going to
be kind of like the recommended go-to
sweet spot for rising 3,000 so a lot of
people who are putting new builds
together that's kind of recommended what
you should aim for so good that they
have a few options here they have a 1
point 4 volts Casa latency 14 and 14 15
1535 timed get 2 by 8 gig or 4 by 8 gig
and then they've got this this one a 1.2
volts KITT that's castling Z 18 so I'm
gonna be slightly lower power yeah good
you seem to get out of that and then
there's a few in between so I have to
kind of wait and see what the pricing is
on this it's not listed in the article
hopefully it is competitive and yeah I
guess for anyone the other thing about
rising 3000
that supposed to be a lot more widely
compatible right which I've found to be
true so far in my testing well there and
he sticks I throw in there it just like
subscribe
get some existing memory that's cheaper
yeah black brushed aluminum and touted
powder coated silver so Franzese ting
okay one last bit of tech hardware news
8 o'seas Aegon monitors are have been
announced actually available now in
order them on Amazon you may be
interested in these if you are like a
twitch gamer I guess because they have
really fast response time 0.5
milliseconds MP RT response time as well
as the 240 Hertz refresh rate so yeah
for the eSports ears out there it's got
this red back which I don't know it
doesn't bother me
the but the back of monitors don't
bother me they there could be like there
could be like Bozo the Clown on the back
of it and I wouldn't care because I
don't really never get seen by you or
anyone else in the room Stan looks sort
of ok it's it has what how you tilt
suggest adjustment but not pivots anyway
I like the pivot
I need my pivot I need my pivot pal so
two models coming out one is twenty four
point five inch one is twenty seven inch
they're both TN panels 1920 by 1080
resolution with 400 nits of brightness
dynamic refresh rate up to a 240 Hertz
so that's kind of the other big selling
point besides the really fast response
time 48 to 240 Hertz freesync range over
DisplayPort or HDMI also has a low
framerate console compensation display
port HDMI and DVI D&amp;amp;D sub connectors and
I seen that D so would still be in there
built-in quad port USB 3.0 hub 3.5
millimeter audio input and output so you
can pass through from your sound card to
3 watt speakers they're probably suck
but I'd rather than be there than that
red accents
oh yeah just heightened tilt from the
stand
there's something called a quick switch
button to rapidly switch from one mode
to another it's like a really ultra-low
response time no that completely removes
any signal processing from the monitor
itself ooh do the fastest click to
response yeah
these I was hoping these would be a
little bit more competitively priced but
I guess when you're looking at the
really high refresh rate it's not that
horrible for twenty four point five inch
one a g25 1m z two it's three hundred
and thirty dollars and the smaller one
the I'm sorry the bigger one twenty
seven inch is three hundred and eighty
dollars three hundred thirty three
hundred and eighty and they are not
available in Europe man help how good
how good of a gamer do you have to be to
to buy a TN panel just because it has a
faster response time the end panels have
come a lot of a long way I think they
have their place have they yeah I got I
got the seventh one last year and I was
very underwhelmed you and it was a mom
with a lime TN panel oh maybe I just had
a really good IPS panel next to it that
was making it look lousy buddy yes I
mean and you're also one who has had the
visual experience of a lot more high-end
monitors than most people you know I
know whole spoiled I'm a superspy regard
but yeah a jerk but yeah he was very
nice the specs that I just thought was
interesting the article points out not
available in Europe just anyone in
Europe just fuck you you can't get these
motors I don't know why they did him
just Europe that's harsh everywhere but
yep
sorry European viewers more segments
it's gonna burn wait where'd it go one
more second I didn't updated I don't
know everything
horrible okay I'm gonna fix this hey
this is much more photogenic enough
success to the what okay the picture
quality was good oh wait hold on
movemove xsplit to this monitor really
quick hold on I need I need my and I oh
joy where did you go okay cuz do you see
how lousy the picture quality looks
there it looks like it's all whitewashed
yeah so there's your monitor compare
what to say that's a TN that's an IPS it
looks yeah if it's somebody else in
chats it also I would go thank you so I
was looking at here and then I looked at
it and like unload it looks fine there
anywhere it looks fine yeah okay I'm
just making sure that adversity
decent quality so joy it's a segment
about terrible terrible things
and typically we offer no solution for
them so it's pretty pretty pretty much a
downer this what makes the title of this
segment so sarcastic yeah exactly
absolutely sarcasm a bit of a theme for
this one and that is that you are being
watched
well not well obviously we are we're
eating watch you're being listened to
Oh even them even you're being wet you
guys like everyone watching this right
not in a good way you're being listened
to perhaps without your consent even
when you're naked and that information
is being shared with people that you
don't know nudes for them listening to
the things that you're saying the sounds
emanating from the most private areas of
your life in the most private parts and
those private parts of your body of your
privates what are the most private parts
of your privates does it be like a
nipple oh my god I'm getting curvier -
claims just constants are you serious
from what ohoo today probably all the
same person you know if they come into
batch like that it's usually some like
one sample that's a DREV Oh which I just
I have to go and go there are released
but like I have to go and manually I
mean what are you paying him for face
you stupid just tell fullscreen just say
do something like cutting you text for
every month because last time I had you
and I got pissed off about it but then I
ever disputed them all and then they
were all released and then I was like
okay absolutely as it's been happening
again okay that's appropriate that it
should pop up in the hojo segment Amazon
workers are listening to what you tell
Alexa are you Alexei ah I have Alexis
somewhere in this house that's actually
yeah you have the the
the Google one too well I have Google
and I also have Alexa I only have Alexa
because I bought it for a video because
I did a showdown between my own Alexa
with my grandpa oh yeah and now and now
I actually use it only for our shades we
have roller shades that are Amazon Alexa
enabled so I can be like Alexa open the
shades and so it's kind of a cool smart
smartphone feature that's not our smart
home feature that's not currently
supported by Google just it seems like a
super reasonable thing to give up your
personal privacy for it definitely it's
now now the only like everyone at Amazon
knows when I open my shades and they can
use that information against me well
that may be then but all right so
humanity I'm scared so globally this is
why I know so many of you are being
listened to right he loves the Sun
consumer about 78 million Smart speakers
last year for us all of them Amazon echo
which was originally launched in 2014
BAM there's the Google home of course is
Apple's home pod you know I keep getting
this stupid commercial when we're
watching overwatch League right now
that's not every roughly we watching
overwatch League house hunters oh I
think it's a house hunters one anyway um
Google's probably just recommending you
it's the property brothers guys in there
like they're like smart homes Stubbs
changed our lives
blah blah I'm like fuck you attached my
life where did this all into place white
bean just like I bought these smart
speakers and they like to ask Google an
Alexa things and hear the response and
control stuff with their voices and
everything makes you feel like in the
future
yep is it worth it though Alexa voice
review the the Alexa voice review
process has been described by seven
people who worked in the program because
there is a human role in training these
software algorithms to recognize speech
and provide accurate helpful answers to
it the article describes a mix of
contractors and full-time Amazon
employees working in outposts from
Boston to Costa Rica India and Romania
they typically work nine hours a day
each of
your purses as many as 1,000 audio clips
per shift and they describe it as
arranged a lot of it is boring work
pulling up clips that say tape that say
Taylor Swift for example mm-hmm and then
telling that the software that those are
they're referring to the musical artist
Taylor Swift not like a tailor like I
want a really fast it's going to you
swiftly I need a suit like pronto right
right yeah see could be could be
misconstrued and it's a can but these
workers also hear other stuff ranging
from anything like a woman singing badly
off-key in the shower to stuff that's
slightly more to skirt disturbing like a
child screaming for help and sometimes
even even upsetting stuff such as
possibly what might have been a sexual
assault that was subscribed by a couple
of workers in the article whoa
so it's hearing things even without
people saying hey Alexa
well Kyle wait till I get to the
southern half of the story today to talk
a little bit more about that kind of
some more details on that interestingly
the article also describes EKKO owners
frequently asking the echo itself the
paranoid questions such as do you work
for the NSA or Alexa is someone else
listening to us right now
yeah like Alexa would just tell you but
I'm paranoid our smart speaker might be
listening to us and monitoring the stuff
we do how can you be sure let's ask it
Alexa blink wonder you're sure it can't
lie being controlled by yes the world is
spying on you anyway destroy me for
their article here on the same topic
from ARS tech Ars Technica keep marina
alright Technica about Google for those
of you who are like well I don't have
Alexa I have Google and and or for those
of you who are like I don't have a smart
speaker in my home but maybe you have an
Android phone that does have Google as
little assistant enabled sure because
this is about workers listening to your
ok Google queries mmm I just said that
is it pick it up
see listen even do this my Google home
and his phone just responded with the
definition of what a query is wearing
okay Google
shut the fuck up I'll bet it does it it
does listen when you told me of your
phones did that at the same time this is
kind of creepy it's it's like an
interesting social experiment that it's
also a little creepy
all right so this article specifically
talks about I mean a lot of this a lot
of the discussion about this that's been
going on this week in particular is from
a specific leak it's above about a
thousand voiced recordings to a media
outlet called VRT news which is in
Belgium the Belgian Belgians are
listening to our flemish region of
belgium which means like we were both
exactly on the same page like each other
saying i know you're going with this
[Laughter]
i've heard it's beautiful but I just
can't have another lose all the time
apologies to any of our European viewers
much offense has been passed in your
direction Mishnah bastards alright so
anyway the newzik news organization
contacted a couple of workers
specifically who worked for google and
they were actually able to get more than
a thousand google assistant recordings
from them so that this isn't just like
them talking to them about what they do
and hearing them they actually provided
them with the Google assistant
recordings yeah this is from a Google
subcontractor specifically so this the
recordings would be sourced from Google
home smarts Google home smart speakers
Android devices like your phones as well
as Chromebooks and they said in the
recordings you could clearly hear
addresses as well as other sensitive
information that made it easy for the
VRT news to contact the people involved
and confront them with the audio
recordings I'm sure isn't creepy at all
no some journalists being like hey have
a recording
you asking what query
yes that's kind of interesting Oh Google
home is only supposed to record when
when users say the keywords right hey
gee I feel bad repeating again Yami
we've already said I apparently turned
someone's TV off I'm sorry you guys okay
G or the hey AG we're trying to truncate
them and no more false flags ooh
but VRT News said that 153 of the 1000
recordings it listened to were
conversations that should never have
been recorded during which the command
was clearly not given that's 15 percent
that's a lot that's a fucked up that's
not a few rain amounts in cases that 15
percent of the 1000 recordings and
seventy eight million people bought
smart home speakers yes fifteen percent
of 78 million is still a metric fuckton
yeah so oh shit Google was given a
chance to respond they have a lengthy
quote in the article I'm not gonna sit
over the whole thing
Google's response was more like well one
of our language of viewers has violated
our data security policies by leaking
confidential edge audio data they are
more worried about like this this data
breach because the people working for
them probably as a subcontractor again
you know just leaked this this
information to through the media Google
said as part of our work to develop
speech technology for more languages we
partner with language experts around the
world who understand the nuances and
accents of a specific language we apply
a wide range of safeguards to protect
the user privacy throughout the entire
review process both internally and with
our affiliates which is sounds like
exactly what something Google would say
point being like I said you're being
listened to whether you want to or not
whether you've said the keywords or not
have it appear and I want to get so you
know those pouches that they've been
giving out at couches
yeah those pouches that they've been
giving out at at concerts right they do
a concert they don't want anyone to have
their phones to show pictures or do
recordings of it so they make you put
your phone in packets are these special
pouches yeah banana I've only been to
one
when we saw dave chappelle okay and they
had that because it was like it was like
his new material right he didn't want
anyone recording it get out see yeah you
put your phone on this pouch and it like
locks yeah and then yeah so you still
have your phone but you can't get at it
or anything and it blocks the city limit
point being I'm like well I can't one of
those patches to put my phone in when I
just want a little bit of goddamn
privacy yeah no shit
right okay I'm that's that's fucked up
but you know it's tough because I feel
like if they remove the human
interaction and remove actual humans
listening in on these conversations then
you need I mean they're doing it for a
reason they're doing it to improve the
performance of the product so I feel
like there's sort of a sweet spot maybe
that you you kind of have to find a
compromise with what you're comfortable
with because if they just removed all
human interaction all human listening
all together then these products would
not work to the degree that they do and
you would have and we'd be doing the
same fucking show episode 194 whatever
complaining about how the the Internet
is just shitting on these products for
being terrible garbage products and that
they're overpriced and no one should buy
them because they can't figure out
Taylor Swift from fucking soothe me up
with a Taylor like there's there's gotta
be some sort of I didn't mean to mention
that at some point so I forget you bring
that bring that up right you're right if
if Google or Apple or Amazon wants these
devices to work well there has to be
some sort of review process I think the
question would be stop listening to me
Google I think I think I think employees
are listening to us right now and the
just rated oh my god how good would be
mr. Overstreet yes so the question would
be like who is it and and like
subcontracting out to like third parties
I don't know it just seems like if
you're talking about you know where it
might be sensitive personal information
the subcontracting thing puts it at a
distance gives you the impression that
they're farming this this work out to
people who are they're paying less money
right and that's fine for certain stuff
mm-hmm but you know companies trying to
run business and everything but I don't
know there's this there's some middle
ground there where they can still have a
useful product right people could feel a
little bit safer but probably not gonna
get to that point they're probably just
gonna become more and more encroaching
on our privacy because people it's so
convenient
maybe maybe until AI advances enough to
where we don't need human interaction
anymore yes just figure I'll let you
help all right I'm not sorry for oh joy
this is the last one they're gonna go
through it quickly completely unrelated
I don't know why I'm bringing this up in
relation to this but try my MIT
technology review again sorry I do have
more beer
we should have Bonnie the plan he came
and went so quickly no no it's beautiful
though yeah a day at Dale's Pale Ale or
an arrogant bastard oh oh let's do an
area blitz yeah so yeah the Pentagon has
a laser that can identify people from a
distance by their heart because it's
perfect so yeah exactly so you guys
weren't aware like the iris in your
eyeball or your fingerprints your
cardiac signature your heartbeat okay is
unique um people can be immediately
identified by their heartbeat it can be
used as a way to tell us apart and the
target for this article can be done from
a distance the US Special Forces has
developed for the Pentagon a device
called Jetson which sounds very very
because I'm like meet George Jetson and
everything right that sounds like the
Jetsons only yeah yeah the cartoon it's
called Jetson it detects a person's
unique cardiac signature with an
infrared laser and it works at 200
meters or 200
19 yards and free immunes and according
to the article longer distances
distances could be possible with a
better laser lovely why the US Special
Forces and the Pentagon don't have the
best laser as possible I don't know I
guess they might have to go over to
darpur or something like that and be
like a give us a better lazy guys limit
creepy quote from Stuart revelry of the
Pentagon's combating terrorism technical
support office I don't want to say you
could do it from space duck duck with no
and act like the coluche I put the Dada
Dada but does he's follow that up with
because I don't wanna say you can do it
from space but longer ranges should be
possible very big oh my god that's like
they're close I just I just immediately
like like I want video of this part of
this to this interview because I
guarantee the distance there is like I
don't want to say you can do it from
space please a Morse code I smile blink
some Morse code open killing like run
fucking now take your family oh my god
we're watching you always Oh God Jetson
uses a technique known as laser vibrant
vibrant vibrator Vibram entry by Brahma
tree that's not as exciting laser by
Brahma tree I think would be the way to
pronounce Sam's kinky and to detect the
surface movement caused by the heartbeat
and it works through typical clothing
like a shirt and jacket will not work
through thicker clothing like a winter
coat so everyone should dress warm if
you don't want to be remotely identified
by the Pentagon your Special Forces they
actually adapted it from an
off-the-shelf device usually used to
check vibration from a distance and
structures such as wind turbines they
attach that to a special gimbal so that
an invisible quarter-sized laser spot
can be kept on the target geez takes
about 30 seconds to get a good return
they're reporting over 90 foot 95
percent accuracy and another person in
the miracle quoted said they should
probably get be able to get up to 90
80% accuracy which is more stable and
can reach anyway he says compared to
compared with face metrics like
identification by like you know video of
the face or something like that
cardiac biometrics are more stable and
can reach more than 98% accuracy geez
very very so doesn't mean like World War
3 is gonna be fought from space look
there will be satellites that target
specific faces and people based on their
heartbeats where like the next Saddam
Hussein's just walking through the
streets he just walked in just like a
bullet from space or a laser from space
whatever just pinpoint 99.9% accuracy
from space you can't retaliate unless
you've got your own satellites to
destroy that satellite somehow like is
that where we're headed
are we doing are we talking about space
war now yeah this is crazy
okay like hi so I I gave up I've given
I've given up hope for the future of
humanity long ago well of course as has
any rational human at this point of
course so really the question is when it
comes to the technology available to
hand to do this type of thing is who
owns it and what's urgent of nefarious
uses might they put it to Russia and I
when it comes to both governments and
corporations
I have zero trust than any of them to
use any of this wisely or responsibly or
anything so oh joy that is our segments
cool thank you for watching I I think
I'd be drink up we have really positive
stuff to talk about on Cal staff of the
show so if you stuck through my half
thank you so much for joining us
mr. Cal's half now it's linked in the
video description yep check that up if
you're watching on twitch just stay
where you're at don't do anything if
you'd like to thumbs up button on this
episode please do so and if you and big
thank you to the time stamp maker yes
and also selling my fee and chat for
moderating I'd sell my tea thank you
all right thanks I'm crafty icy crafty
crafty anyone else I missed okay
