finally live and I wanted to start this
video off by saying a huge thank you to
all of you guys for your support and
your feedback all the likes that you've
given on that video as well as all the
questions you've been asking I've been
trying to reply to as many of those as
possible you might notice though that
the system is actually still out here in
my garage and I am trying to bring you
guys at least one video a week with
plans to increase the frequency of that
in the coming weeks however I do have a
dilemma that I live in California it's
mid to upper-90s today and it's only
late morning and it's already starting
get really really hot in here so I don't
think I'm going to be able to do much
more work out here but I have an idea to
bring you guys some good content for
today so I'll just follow me wait I need
to take the camera with me let's move
this way we're going to go back through
the house here's a quick gratuitous
Nouri video and Oscar's I actually have
a YouTube channel set up for Inori it's
called Paul Dawg tips so kind of you
know take off on Linus's cat channel but
I have a bunch of videos I'm going to
start posting those there so let me know
in the comments if you guys want to see
more of nori and she cute we've been
playing some Final Fantasy 7 out here
actually my wife wanted to play some of
that and very exciting I've been helping
her out but I was actually using my new
computer out here for a while I had it
set up right there and I was using it to
play Assassin's Creed Black Flag on a
big screen but the reason I haven't
actually got it set up to use in here
which is our actual computer room is a
few different reasons for one it's a
total chaos in here complete mess but
what I want to do for you guys today is
a desk tour and instead of just showing
you guys the desk like it's immaculate
clean and pristine condition I'm going
to show you the before and after so this
is the before I really haven't cleaned
in here in a quite a while here's my
existing system which I'm going to be
replacing and I'll show you one of the
reasons why I think if you see the side
panel is off on the system it's really
it's got some issues I don't know if you
can hear that but that's a haystack
going bad or at least with a terrible
rattle and I haven't swapped that out or
done anything in here because I've been
waiting to actually bring my new system
in here but now that the build is done I
think I can do that
so here's the before I'm going to show
you the middle and the after and then if
things go as planned I'm also going to
be doing some led installations on the
new system so here's here's me cleaning
up my desk
and I am back and it is time for the
desk tour as promised as you can see I
like to keep things nice and tidy clean
and orderly as always but let's let's
start over here on this side first off
this is my old system and as you can see
I kind of flip-flop where I had my
system set up for a few different
reasons one is that I have a whiteboard
over here which I think I'm actually
going to put up on the wall there used
to track and coordinate videos a little
bit better for my channel over here we
have so this is kind of the secondary
desk the old system is currently on it
that's temporary it's going to be moved
eventually but I get a little a little
monitor setup and I've actually already
been copying some of the footage and
stuff that I got today now there are
some parts that I'm still going to be
swapping out of this system and into the
new one among them are the sound card my
Xonar Phoebus which is down there and
there's a little breakout box for that
guy so we'll be swapping that over I
also have some storage at least an SSD
and a hard drive I think I'm going to
swap over and then I'm probably going to
be disassembling this system at least
for the time being it's kind of sad it's
been a good system for me but it's time
time to upgrade and that's all done with
a little memory card reader over there
copying the memories I have the CM storm
or rapid eye this is a this is a Cherry
MX brown keyboard ten keyless it's nice
and portable I like it
made by Coolermaster it's a good one I
also got the funk ms2 over here tucked
away over here is my little jar of thumb
drive so I got lots and lots of time
drives in there for various purposes
this is the main system which I have now
set up over here if you're wondering why
it's kind of at a jaunty angle it I did
that so that I could see the inside when
when it's lit up in there I also did it
so it's got a clear intake and a clear
exhaust at the back I also did it
because the door opens like that and
I'll actually be able to open the door
which I'm going to be doing in just
moment my headset that I use is the
Sennheiser game PC 360 they're wrapped
up right there but I have those I also
have an alt tag line Seng speaker system
which I'm sorry I forget the model
number off the top of my head this is a
very old speaker system but thankfully
speaker systems don't really go bad
my main keyboard for typing at least and
that sort of thing is a Microsoft
economic I don't even know which model
this is actually ah it's Microsoft
natural economic keyboard 4000 version
1.00 there's my zoom h1 which I'm going
to be switching to for audio in just a
moment I swear I promise and then for my
main mouse that I'm using right now just
because it's such an old standby and I
love it none other than the Razer
DeathAdder just such a fantastic
old-school Mouse it always works that
it's it's got such great tracking and I
really like it of course the yarmulke
sealian itis that you guys might have
seen the video on that I did
this one's been alive for gosh a year
and a half or so now it's been working
pretty great I can't complain about the
monitor the AC power brick did give out
at one point I had to pay to get a
replacement but whatevs and then I got a
plain art 27-inch this is also an IPS I
got this one used but it's fantastic
it's actually got really good color
depth um it's it's it stands up well
against the leonidas and since I
finished with the lion's share of my my
moving and cleaning today I've poured
myself a rogue dead guy ale which this
video is not sponsored by Roga ale I
just it's a good beer and then also
something that I think everyone should
get is a UPS and I managed to tuck that
one away back here and that is a
CyberPower 1350 AVR so it's 1350 watts
and it is it has saved my butt several
times now oh and ok one more thing this
is actually under my desk I put it down
here because this is actually a really
strong magnet and I wanted to keep it
away from any flash drives did all my
twist ties I thought this was a clever
way to store them big ass magnet and I
just
and I got one I just stick it right
there so I'm gonna do one more thing in
this video and that is who look my LEDs
from Taiwan I did promise I would
install these so I'm going to do that
I'll show you guys all the LA LEDs I got
from Taiwan actually that's kind of a
tradition at least I did it last year so
I'm going to be plugging those in and
also showing you a really easy trick to
do to set up an LED really easily with
your power supply so the first thing
you're going to want here is a molex to
case fan adapter you can often get these
along with cases or if you buy case fans
I tend out a lot of them lying around
I'm going to go ahead and snip the two
wires that lead out to the fan adaptor
these are the red and black ones that
you can see here go ahead and strip the
ends using any means at your disposal
I'm going to use scissors and then twist
up the wires at the end I also have a
plugin wire that came along with the LED
strip so I'm going to go ahead and snip
off the end of that because I can't use
it and I will just strip and twist the
wires like I did with the molex adapter
from here I'm going to twist up the red
wire from the molex adaptor and the
striped wire from the LED plug and I
will twist up the black wires as well
and tape both of them up with electrical
tape from here you're pretty much good
to go and oh also you should be making
sure that your LEDs are 12 volt ready
before you do any of this now I can go
ahead and test my Taiwan LEDs as you can
see I have a wonderful green color here
for some Nvidia builds I got several
white strips as well I have an awesome
pink one that should be a fun build I
have some red ones for AMD and finally a
unique looking double with purple I'm
going to go ahead and plug in the two
white LEDs and as you can see I've
secured them inside the door at the top
and the bottom I think it looks pretty
sweet so thank you guys so much for
watching this video remember to Like and
subscribe if you haven't already and we
will see you all later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
