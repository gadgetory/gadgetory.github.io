welcome back to Pauls hardware today i'm
bringing it back to tech i've got a tech
video for you and i have some brand new
video cards that were just launched
today or today when you guys are
watching this video this is the geforce
gtx 750ti
the GPU by nvidia very exciting because
it's using the new Maxwell architecture
although it is still on a 28 nanometer
manufacturing process a lot of cool
stuff to talk about with these cards but
actually I've spent a lot of today
already at work doing the sort of
general overviews of these cards so I'd
encourage you guys to check out our new
egg TV youtube channel where I will be
giving some gritty details on these
specific cards not going to do quite as
much of that today because well I wanted
to share some benchmarks with you guys
first of all so you can kind of get an
idea of what type of performance these
cards have and then also I wanted to
help you guys because if you have looked
at these cards and you thought I want
one I'm going to get a 750ti
there's lots of different options
available and when it comes to a lot of
similar cards using the same GPU it can
come down to some minut details deciding
which one to get one over the other so
i've got a pretty nice selection here
from some of the top-tier manufacturers
gigabyte of course msi couple over here
from EVGA as well as asus so i'm going
to give you guys a closer look at each
one of these cards kind of do the pros
and cons of each one from my opinion
looking looking at these and working
with these today but i want to start off
with some benchmarks because first of
all how do you even know if you want a
750 Ti well performance is a good way to
look at that so what I'm going to do
right now here some benchmarks from teen
red the closest competitor right now is
the Radeon r7 260x so I'll be comparing
this HS version of that for you guys as
well throwing that in along with the
gigabyte geforce gtx 750ti the windforce
Edition right here MSI's Twin Frozr
gaming Edition the Asus dual fan cooling
solution that's not the directs you to
but still as a dual fan cooler and then
we got the EVGA for the win Edition
which is there I kind of best of the
best as well as a bit more standard EVGA
superclocked and I want to point out
that all of these cards come overclocked
right out of the box so without further
ado here's some benchmarks for you
so if you guys like those benchmarks and
if you couldn't tell the EVGA for the
win edition just a beast especially when
it comes to overclocking but I'm getting
ahead of myself let's start with a
closer look at each card and I'm going
to be a little bit critical here because
again I'm trying to show you guys what I
mostly liked or didn't like about each
card but this is a windforce addition
card I really like gigabytes win for
Schouler it stays nice and quiet does a
really good job cooling and this one has
two downward firing fans big aluminum
Finneran giving a huge copper heat pipes
eight millimeter heat pipes on either
side so it's going to keep things nice
and cool but honestly when it comes to
cooling performance with the 750 Ti the
Maxwell architecture is very efficient
so it does not generate much heat so the
hottest I saw any of these cards get was
about 55 degrees so the cooling is not
quite as important in that respect so
the things about this card that I wasn't
a huge fan of the blue PCB I'm just I
really not not a big fan of the blue PCB
it doesn't really match with much at
least it's not quite the turquoise color
that we've seen gigabyte do in the past
as well as some other manufacturers but
I guess that's one little complaint
there the other thing here and I'm going
to come back to this with some other
cards it's going to be the video outs
you need DisplayPort 1.2 in order to do
G sync and as you might notice here
gigabyte does not give you DisplayPort
1.2 got a couple dual link DVIs
including a DVI eye so you got the
analog connections there so you've got
legacy support then to HDMI s and
gigabyte is saying you can do a 4k
display at 60 Hertz via two HDMI
outs I have not seen a monitor that
supports that at this point but I
suppose that is something that you might
be interested in if you were looking
into 4k displays personally I'd rather
have the display port which can do 4k
natively as well as have again that
g-sync support so again solid card very
very well performing and this particular
card runs at 10:33 megahertz base clock
and 1111 megahertz boost clock and when
I put a load on it actually boosted up
to about 11 88.5 so again very nice
overclocking performance out of the box
but still not quite as high as the EVGA
for the win Edition and again
the PCB that's more of an aesthetic
complete and the video outs ouch that's
just not my favorite
now MSI sent us over a few different
versions and this is the gaming series
there G series it's a bit prettier
there's another one they sent over
that's not quite as big as this but
sighs that's the biggest thing that
jumped out of me about this one this
one's a full ten and a half inches I
believe long you know they forgot to
double check and measure it well it's
it's about ten at ten inches long the
gigabyte one was just about
seven-and-a-half so that one keeps
things pretty reasonable but this one
just really big and it doesn't seem
necessary to have it that quite that big
so that was one thing I noticed about
this you'll see when I get to the EVGA
one just how small these 750d eyes can
actually be and again with the GPUs not
getting that hot thanks to the
efficiency as well as just but the fact
that it's not a super high end GPU that
generates a lot of heat you're the heat
dissipation really isn't quite as much
of a factor so it's an excellent cooler
again it's going to stay nice and quiet
it's going to do a really good job but
the size of this one was just it's it's
going to be an issue in certain systems
especially if you're looking for mini
ITX or something along those lines and
then apart from that again oh my gosh
video outs again msi has gone with a DVI
D so that's digital only right there and
analog VGA out and I know they're
keeping that there for legacy support
but I just hate these I don't like VGA
so you might as well at my opinion you
could have done a DVI a DVI I with the
VGA adapter and been just fine but then
finally they also got the HDMI out so
again you're not going to have G sync
support with this card and to me that's
that's a big issue if you're investing
in a new card you want access to those
new features
apart from that again really solid card
from an aesthetic standpoint you got the
msi kind of really dark brown PCB so
it's not quite as egregious as the blue
of the gigabyte one oh and I should say
again the base clock on this one 10:59
boost clock eleven thirty seven and when
you put a load on it actually gets up to
about twelve fifteen so again a nice
overclock out of the box from this card
but just a couple of things that I feel
like could have really elevated the
feature capability next up we have the
Asus this one's maintaining the design
aesthetic of the directs you to cooler
although this is not a direct cu2 cooler
because although it does have the two
fans it does not have the direct copper
contact but again cooling not a huge
issue with the 750 t is this one will
stay nice and cool even without that
direct copper connection or any heat
pipes involved you got a pretty decent
sized aluminum Finnair a right there
which expands out to provide plenty of
surface area so again this card was
staying nice and cool nice and quiet
the card measures in at about eight and
a half inches long which isn't huge but
again could be smaller the size of the
cooler extends a few inches beyond the
length of the PCB right there they have
this really wonky positioning for the 16
connector that I thought was also a
little bit weird it's right up there by
the bracket usually you'd see it down on
that end which would make more sense
when you're running your cabling and
everything so I guess that's something
to consider at first I thought I didn't
have a six pin because the 750ti doesn't
need a six pin the MSI for example I
forgot to point that up at the MSI it
doesn't have a six pin at all which is
one of the pluses from that card but
apart from that again nice dark dark
brown PCB so aesthetically looks pretty
nice but then one more time down here
with the display outs and I can't quite
figure out why they're doing this one
this one has four but they split off the
the analog connectors here so they got
to digital dual link DVIs a standalone
VGA I'm guessing you cannot use all four
of these at the same time you can
probably use three of the four and then
an HDMI so plenty of connectivity there
and you can do 3d surround or not 3d
well yeah I think you can do 3d surround
but you can do invidious around for
triple display which is cool although
you'd have to play it really low
settings to do that with the 750ti
but yeah again no DisplayPort so no
g-sync compatibility there so that's
something to keep in mind and I've seen
that with several of these 750ti cards
so keep an eye out for that guys because
if you are looking to take advantage of
g-sync you're going to want a 750ti card
or will any Nvidia card for that matter
that maintains a DisplayPort out so you
can use g-sync apart from those
complaints though a very nice card and
again this one is also overclocked out
of the box base clock 1070 to boost
clock 1150 and when under load I saw
getting up to about 1215 megahertz Maxim
pee-yew so quite nice and now a couple
EVGA s and if you guys hadn't already
noticed I save these for last because
yes these are going to be my personal
pics from the cards the 750ti is that
I've seen so far so this is a gtx 750ti
superclocked or SC from EVGA although
this one is overclocked almost as much
as the for the win Edition this one
comes in at eleven seventy six base
clock
12:55 boosts clock and under load
without you doing anything it's going to
get up to about 1320 pretty impressive
for a card this size they are not using
a supplemental six pin connector so that
is one of those cool things that will
allow you to use this card with a lower
wattage power supply for example or
simply not have to have that extra extra
cable to plug in so that's pretty cool
you got one big old fan it stays pretty
quiet not too loud definitely and just
the overall design I really liked for
this card you got a black shroud a black
PCB stays very very short here so this
is this is going to fit in tons and tons
of systems I keep forgetting to measure
these before I put this in there but
look six inches like less than six
inches measured from the bracket so this
is going to fit in just about any case I
was actually so happy because when I had
this installed I was able to reach the
little release catch on this without
even have to having to get a poke or
anything so I don't know if just just
the simple joys in life that make me
happy they've even done some nice little
little pointers like they've put kind of
a black powder coating on the radial
aluminum fin things there in the middle
which is pretty nice and then they also
have a black powder coating on the rear
bracket again just a nice little touch
they got those extra wide gaps there to
allow air to escape and then oh my gosh
video outs these are maintaining closer
to the Nvidia reference specs so you got
a dual link DVI with analog connection
points there so with the DVI to vga
adapter you could use that with an older
monitor hdmi right there and then oh my
gosh full-size DisplayPort that means
you've got all the goodness of
DisplayPort 1.2 including support for
g-sync hooray
good job EVGA if you guys are looking
for a small card that doesn't need up
too much power has some really nice
performance check out the 750 Ti SC
and I didn't include this one in the
benchmarks but you can pretty much look
at the stock benchmarks that I showed
look at the for the wind benchmarks and
assume this is going to land somewhere
in between but closer to the for the win
edition and lastly the EVGA for the wind
edition geforce gtx 750ti
and as you can see here they have an ACX
cooler on this thing so that's just nice
to get right out of the gate the ACX
cooler from EVGA is quite a nice cooler
stays very cool very quiet duel fans and
I know I've been kind of complaining
size-wize about some of these cards and
how they're longer or larger than they
need to be this one measures in at 9
inches but personally I feel for the
performance that you get if it's it's
acceptable in this particular area
because this one comes out of the box
base clock 1189 boost clock 1268
gets up to 13 45 under load without you
touching anything and because this
already starts so high and because
precision x1 that gives you about 135
points of GPU at extra GPU frequency I
was actually able to get this thing up
to where it was boosting to 1435 which
is pretty insane for a single GPU so
some really excellent performance gains
from that as you probably saw in the
benchmarks but apart from that's again
nice black PCB let'em extra extension
here to protect the fin ra on the ACX
cooler as well as some extra ventilation
all the goodness of that AC X cool you
can see the aluminum fins right there in
the middle there are some copper heat
pipes as part of that AC X clue you can
see the termination ends right there
those just go straight across and make
contact with the GPU down there but a
very nice looking card that's going to
fit nicely in anyone's case you get the
EVGA logos properly there on the side
you do have a 6 pin connector for this
one but again I felt for the
overclocking potential that was
warranted in this particular
circumstance and if you really don't
need all of the extra oomph that you get
from the for the win Edition then just
go with that smaller superclocked
Edition and they'll be all set right
there you don't need the extra 6 pin and
it's overclocked almost as much and I
didn't quite see how much Headroom I
could get on that one but you know I had
a limited amount of time today so there
you go and then finally again the black
the black PCI bracket here at the back
full size display port HDMI as well as
dueling DVI so all the support for all
the Nvidia goodness that you could want
so a great entry card I'm going to think
for people who are building a basic
computer right now you want your display
for it get your system set up get it a
get a get a g-sync capable monitor plug
that in and then hey maybe in the future
upgrade to a faster card if that's your
bag if that's what you're feeling you
need but a great way to start right here
so there's a closer look at the EVGA
geforce gtx 750ti
for the win so there you go guys and if
I haven't made it abundantly clear
already my favorite from amongst this
group and the cards that I've seen so
far which is not all of them by the way
I'm not looking at every card from every
manufacturer is definitely the EVGA for
the win Edition right here just had that
really nice combination of the top level
performance that gives a really
reasonable design and then again EVGA
stickin with the DisplayPort 1.2
connectors on board wasn't quite sure
why the other cards did not to go with
that because it seems to me like a
really good upgrade path you know you
can start off with the 650 Ti right or a
750 Ti right now maybe you don't have
quite enough cash for that pair that up
with maybe your shield if you want to do
some streaming set that up with with the
G sync monitor because that's something
that's really exciting for even for
people who aren't investing in a top-end
graphics card just having that type of
gameplay and it's going to be very very
very popular
so I'm DisplayPort 1.2 and all the
capabilities for the win definitely my
top choice amongst this group but of
course lots of great options as well
from these the other manufacturers if
you're interested in those if you like
the look or the design or something
specific about that hey go for whichever
one best suits your needs but I'd love
to hear your feedback on my conclusions
after looking at these cards let me know
if you think that that was definitely
the best one to go to go with or if you
thought one of these other cards was
also an excellent contender thank you so
much for watching this video though stay
tuned for more just like it don't forget
