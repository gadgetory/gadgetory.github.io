the win and it's my first look at a 1080
with a custom PCB and especially
designed cooler EVGA ACX 3.0 I've
already over viewed many of the features
of the 1080 in my original video that
you can check out via the card right up
there so today I'll be focusing on what
makes this card different and of course
a bunch of benchmarks and some over
blocking performance I also want to talk
about some of the critiques against the
1080 specifically the potential for GPU
clock speed throttling and the current
pricing and availability woes that have
plagued the good honest people who just
want to buy one of these cards for the
price at Nvidia announced the matte back
in May goddamn it before any of that
though a quick once-over of the card
itself at the heart of the attend 80 for
the win is the GP 104 in videos Pascal
GPU that all 10 eighties are based on as
well as eight gigabytes of gddr5 X
memory running at 10,000 megahertz
effective clock speed EVGA redesigned
the PCB from the founders Edition which
made it a bit taller but they also
increase the power delivery to a 10
phase design as compared to the 5 phase
setup on the reference board and added
another 8 pin power connector to allow
for higher overall power draw on top of
that is the newly redesigned AC X 3.0
cooler with 200 millimeter double ball
bearing fans with swept blades direct
contact copper heat pipes down below and
a large aluminium thinner a for heat
dissipation it's an open design and
although it does run cooler than the
founders Edition it will be pushing more
warm air into your case so keep air flow
in mind if you're building a new system
the card does light up via the logo
along the edge as well as these panels
on the fans side of the cooler and these
are RGB of course so you can adjust the
colors and some of the lighting effects
via the EVGA precision xoc software
finally there's a two-position physical
bios switch which can be very handy if
you're playing around with a variety of
OC settings and want to easily jump
between them rather than using software
profiles before the win Edition comes
manufacturer overclocked as well with a
base and boost clock of 1721 and 1860 as
compared to the batteries Edition which
runs at 1607 base and
17:34 boost it's also 10.5 inches long
I've heard varying opinions on the
overall design here and while I
personally don't think it's the
prettiest card ever I think in the right
system it could still look quite badass
let me know what you think in the
comments down below though ok on to some
testing and let's start out with thermal
throttling J did a great video on this
and I was actually surprised to hear
that his original founders edition card
throttled so much he started off hitting
mid eighteen hundreds clock speeds but
after warming the GPU up with some
gameplay it wrapped all the way down to
the mid to low 1600s that's a pretty
significant drop and it's caused by a
variety of things including the ASIC
quality of your individual GPU the
ambient temperature and wear whatever
room you're overclocking in the
effectiveness of your cards cooler of
course and whether the planets of our
solar system are synchronized and
aligned in perfect orbit battling the
severe sucks and it didn't help that at
the launch event last month NVIDIA made
some bold claims by demoing an
overclocked card running at 2.1
gigahertz and only hitting 67 degrees on
air this may have been a mistake in my
opinion is clearly the demo they're
running was not very GPU intensive and
no one has found a card yet that can hit
that frequency and stay that cool
especially with the founder's edition
cooler under normal gaming load all that
said though I wanted to see what
frequencies my 1084 the win and my 1080
founders Edition would level out at
after gaming for a while so I concocted
a simple test with Unigine heaven on a
loop over about 15 plus minutes or
however long it took the card to warm up
to its maximum temperature due to heat
pooling the temperature kind of creeps
up slowly until the hit 83 degrees
Celsius on the founders edition during
which time the fans may ramp up a bits
and the frequency may dip down as GPU
boost attempts to keep everything under
control I did keep the AC on in the
garage so ambient temperature was a
steady 77 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit or 25
to 27 degrees Celsius and with both
cards running at full stock here were my
results both cards throttled but not a
whole lot my GTA X 1080 founders Edition
hit an initial peak frequency of 1873
megahertz but after temps got up to 83 C
it pulled back to the mid to high 1700s
averaging about 1784 this is still a
good 50 megahertz above the advertised
boost so not bad the EVGA 1084 the wind
being a manufacturer overclocked had an
initial peak frequency of about 20
25 megahertz and after maxing out at 75
C underload dawdle back to 1949 again
still well above the advertised boost
black values so pretty nice for a
specially-designed card I'll continue to
include throttle testing in my videos
though and for anyone who picks up a
1080 I would definitely definitely
recommend setting up a loop test to see
where your GPUs frequency levels max out
after 10 or 20 minutes of gameplay
anyway I overclocked this GPU as well
and it did give me some extra
performance but I was not able to
consistently hit over 2.1 gigahertz
added 120 points to the GPU and 95 to
the memory did an initial OC of 2114
megahertz and then throttled back to
about 20 88 after the card warmed up I
did use a custom fan profile that ended
up doing about 70 percent fan speed at
Maxwell benchmarking under full load but
it also kept the GPU cooler than when it
was running with the stock profile
peaking at 69 degrees so go figure it's
definitely not a bad overclock but it
does seem like these non binned GPUs
don't have a ton of extra Headroom
although throttling under load was
thankfully pretty minimal lesson learned
here is definitely to ramp up those fan
profiles on your 1080s as it's minimal
additional noise but it gives you a
decent amount of extra GPU speed my
overclocking results can be seen in the
first couple benchmark slides speaking
of which it's time for some benchmarks
this time I have 4k 1440 and 1080
resolution numbers these were all run on
an open testbed with an Intel Core i7 59
30k CPU at 4.4 gigahertz 16 gigs of
g.skill ripjaws for 2666 speed ddr4
memory an EVGA x99 classified
motherboard and a HyperX savage 240 SSD
let's roll
so it should come as little surprise
that the GTX 1084 the wind running about
eight to ten percent faster than the
founders addition also scores about
eight to ten percent better frame rates
across all the benchmarks I was actually
more impressed with the fact that the
GPU temps stayed under control in the
mid 70s under load and the fan noise was
quite minimal as well since they don't
spin up at all at idle and under load
only ramped up to 47% speed maximum at
the stock profile here's a listen in
zero fan mode just for ambient noise
here the fans at 47% speed which is the
max they got at the stock profile here
it is at 69% speed which is as fast as
they got when I was overclocking and
finally a hundred percent fan speed just
to see what it sounds like hear what it
sounds it
as for power draw though that is the
trade-off as I did see power drop
peaking above 400 watts with before the
wind card whereas my founders Edition
only pulled about 305 watts maximum from
the wall I would feel a bit better about
this if I was able to overclock the card
a little bit more incidentally while
overclocking I peaked at about 445 watts
finally there is the price which at 680
dollars is steep but still less than the
$700 founders Edition availability seems
to be the biggest challenge right now
though as retail cards are selling out
instantly and resellers in the US and
abroad are charging ridiculous markups
we're told that in July though there
should be many many more 1080s available
on the market so by next month you
should be able to get your hands on one
for the actual list price all things
considered EVGA has built a very nice
card around the 1080 with an effective
cooler and some extra value features
beyond what you get with the founders
edition bear in mind though that you're
not getting a bended GPU with the for
the wind
so your overclocking experience might
have you wanting if you were really
hoping to run at 2.1 gigahertz or beyond
if the RGB lighting isn't important to
you you could probably get equal
performance and save 30 to 50 bucks by
going with the super clocked or standard
ACX 3.0 version of the 1080 as was all
overclocking though it will greatly
depend on luck of the draw in the
silicon lottery thanks a lot for
