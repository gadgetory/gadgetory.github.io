Paul this is episode number 34 for March
2019 that's a monthly Q&amp;amp;A you guys ask
questions I answer them it's a pretty
simple concept all of the questions from
today's video were taken from the
comments section from last month's
probing Paul which you can check out
I'll post the playlist in the
description if you want to look at all
of the probing Paul's
I've been probed many times and it was
always fun so let's check out the first
question without delay from creepeth
explode us oh seven who says my new RX
588 gig sapphire keeps overheating and
shutting my system down what should I do
group√≠s explode us there's some lacking
information here but I'm going to give
you some basic generic tips based on
what you've told me an overheating
graphics card is bad it shouldn't do
that especially if you're not
overclocking it yourself so I would
double check make sure that all of your
intakes for your case are cleared free
of obstruction don't have any dust in
them or anything just make sure it's
getting clear fresh air flow if that is
okay then you want to take the card
itself out double-check the fans make
sure they're not clogged up make sure
you don't have a bunch of dust on the
thin stacks themselves if that still
doesn't fix the problem then you'll
probably want to go into disassembling
the card and make sure you have good
contact between the cooler itself and
the GPU because that can lead to
overheating but when a graphics card
overheats it's probably gonna down clock
itself rather than just shutting your
system down entirely
so that would maybe indicate that you
might have a different problem than your
graphics card itself I would point
towards the power supply if you've got a
shoddy power supply that's not able to
deliver enough power that could trigger
one of the built-in protection systems
from the power supply and that would
automatically shut off your system so I
would double-check your power supply
that might be where the problem actually
lies next question here is from robear
27 he says should I get horizon 5 2600
now or wait for rise in 3rd gen he also
says congrats on one mill and the baby
thank you thank you very much for both
of those things I did hit at 1 million
between last month's probing Paul and
this month's probing Paul but before I
get into that let me answer your
question
Verizon v 2600 I've recommended multiple
times because you can get it for about
160 270 dollars 6 cores 12 threads comes
with a cooler it's not the best cooler
but it's an adequate cooler so it's a
great bang for the buck but we now know
that Rison 3000 series are probably
coming out in June or July
that's what we're looking at so only
about two months maybe three months
until that product actually launches
we're still speculating as to the
performance how many cores will be
available on the different processors
but we have at least a reasonable idea
when it's gonna launch so whenever I get
this specific question especially if the
new launch is relatively soon my
question to you is what are you using
right now is it adequate is it getting
you buy or is it actively hurting your
ability to get work done and causing you
massive frustration if that's the case
then I'd say just upgrade now because
not only is this a good deal just on the
face of it but we are seeing some price
drops that have been happening recently
as well on our live show on Tuesday I
mentioned the rise in 720 700 coming
down to 220 dollars it has unfortunately
bounced back up to 240 that's still a
reasonably good deal but I would keep an
eye out in the next month to see if
there's any really good deals on the
existing rise in 2000 series processors
because they're still very good CPUs
I'll link that one down the video's
description by the way but I guess the
last thing to point out would be that if
you do invest in a 2000 series CPU right
now according to everything we have
learned m4 will still be the socket for
the next-gen 3000 series stuff that
comes out in a couple months so you
could potentially upgrade the system
that you build right now with the 2000
series processor to one of those 3000
series processors down the line so that
gives you a little bit more flexibility
in your decision hopefully that
information helps you out a little bit
next question here is just from Rick
very very simple is the triple slot EVGA
28 EXC ultra non TI worth the price bump
over the dual slot versions I like it
quiet and cool GPU as much the next guy
the dual slot versions on so 430 dollars
cheaper today but the price gap is
usually $50 so here I've just pulled up
EVGA r-tx 20 80s on Newegg and we can
see they get as expensive as well like
$900 for the article versions but let's
say 800 to 850 dollars for the high-end
versions like the for the win three
ultra with three fans and everything the
most inexpensive version is the RK X 28
exc gaming and if you add that to the
cart you can see the current sale price
720 dollars so that's a pretty massive
swing like of 150 to 200 dollars from
this sort of more entry-level RT X 2080
up to the higher-end versions and the
thing you gotta bear in mind is we're
really talking about
difference in clock speed there is the
manufacturer out of the box clock speeds
and then there are the clock speeds that
you might be able to get when you
overclock yourself my personal opinion
is that there's usually a lot of
headroom especially on these aftermarket
design cards even if you're getting
those lower end versions compared to the
range that they sell in with any given
GPU like an RT X 2080 so my advice to
you would be to not spend that amount
especially if you're talking about a
price premium of a hundred bucks or more
if you're talking twenty or thirty
dollars then it might be reasonable to
get the better version if it's got a
better cooler it might run a little bit
cooler or it might get a little bit
better clock speeds but I would go with
the cheaper one honestly in this
situation the price difference there
just isn't really going to be
represented in the performance you get
with the higher-end version next
question here from captain capsize is it
true you need DP or a display port to
use freesync on NVIDIA GPUs and HDMI to
use freesync on AMD GPUs I'm gonna try
to answer this really quickly yes NVIDIA
GPUs require DisplayPort in order to use
adaptive sync technology that includes
g-sync that also includes if you're
using a free sync monitor with an Nvidia
g-sync capable graphics card which only
works with the 10 series the GTX 1066
gig and above so that includes the RT X
series of cards that have launched in
the last year or so two on the AMD side
if you're talking about free sync with a
free sync capable Radeon graphics card
and a free sync capable monitor in that
case you can use HDMI or DisplayPort
it's a little bit more flexible there
but do bear in mind especially if you're
looking at free sync monitors and you
have an Nvidia graphics card you should
absolutely make sure it has a
DisplayPort input and if you guys want a
little bit more on that I'll link to
this PC world article by Brad sharkus
now in the description which has a
little bit more details on free sync as
well as using free sync monitors with
g-sync graphics cards next up is XT 5s
question he says thanks to finding this
channel I'm ready to embark on my first
build excellence xt 5 that is like the
goal of my channel and he also says
congrats on 1 million thank you very
much I'm very happy about that Pro right
now I'm leaning towards your most recent
budget build with the Rison 320 200 G
horizon 5 2500 G graphics card upgrade
in the future well I need to buy a
processor without integrated graphics
when I upgrade to a discreet graphics
we'll the G work just as well you do not
have to upgrade your CPU you can still
keep that CPU just add the discrete
graphics card and that will work just
fine
that said depending on the graphics card
you upgrade to I would seriously
consider upgrading your CPU because the
2200 G is a great bargain for about
ninety to a hundred dollars it's a quad
core but it does not have simultaneous
multi-threading so it's four cores and
four threads you actually do get a bump
up in CPU performance with the 2400 G
cuz it's four cores and eight threads
that said I would just base this on what
graphics card you upgrade to and this is
gonna be generic because there's lots of
variables that go into it but if you're
spending like two or three hundred
dollars on your graphics card upgrade
then you can probably still get by with
the 2400 G as a CPU at least 2200 G
would also still probably be just fine
if you're spending much more than that
then I would definitely encourage
looking at something like a risin 5 2600
which you can get for about a hundred
and sixty $170 that would give you more
cores more threads higher frequency and
probably give you a better overall
experience with your system but what I
love about it is the flexibility you can
choose to do that now or you can choose
to just stick with your current CPU see
how the performance of your graphics
card does and then maybe decide in the
future ah I would like a little bit more
horsepower to the CPU so I'll buy a new
one and swap it in here's a kind of
interesting question from Britt Scott
can you still use a hard drive enclosure
from an external hard drive after the
original drive inside has died assuming
you can replace the dead drive so if so
can you mix and match HDD brands to work
with the original enclosure I don't
think there's a direct answer to this
question and that's mainly because when
you buy external hard drive enclosures
like this you there's a variety of ways
that they set these up for example I've
had some WD external drives this I've
decided to pull apart the enclosure to
get the drive out because I thought that
would be more useful for me and found
that the drive inside actually has a USB
interface rather than a SATA interface
so that would make it very difficult to
replace the drive inside of inside
because it's a little bit more
proprietary and you would need to get
one with that interface in order to plug
into the external enclosure you can buy
a separate external enclosure by itself
and those often can be very nice
usually those are just SATA if your
external enclosure when you pull it
apart and take the drive out just has a
standard
SATA interface like a 2.5 inch or 3.5
inch hard drive or SSD would have then
there's a much higher likelihood that
you could just get a new working hard
drive swap it in there and it would work
just fine that said once again there's a
slight possibility that the controller
that they have installed in here has
baked in firmware that looks for a drive
that is of the same brand or even the
same line that the enclosure originally
shipped with and in that case it
probably wouldn't work with a new drive
so your answer is maybe depending on the
variables in play so pull it apart see
what the interface is you can get your
new drive and try it in there and if it
doesn't work then you would just need to
buy an external enclosure which you can
usually find for like 15 or 20 bucks
here's a question from Barry the fish he
says Paul what we need to know for April
is do I need to wear powder with
foundation should I wear eyeliner
underneath my eyes and my tool to wear
red lipstick how long should I keep my
mascara and of course can I wear bronzer
year-round and this is all of course a
response to my April Fool's video from
last year here it is it's called Paul's
skin care and makeup and yes my brief
babbling in switching my channel from
tech coverage over to covering you know
makeup and stuff like that my wife
helped out with this video and actually
had a lot of fun with it and just sort
of in a related note tying into last
month's probing Paul when people are
asking of me about like some challenging
times I went through and everything I
really enjoyed this video because it was
April last year and I produced it at a
time when I had been going through sort
of a rough patch and it was the first
video in quite a while that sort of
occurred to me I felt good about it it
was an idea that kind of grew very
naturally and I did the video and I was
happy with it and people seemed to enjoy
it so it for me kind of represents a
turning point last year when things sort
of started to look a little bit brighter
that said I'm not going to be doing a
follow up makeup tutorial video this
year I apologize I will be posting a
video on April Fool's it's only slightly
April Fool's II but let me know in the
comments section if you guys really want
me to sort of branch out in other
facility videos like that I had fun with
this one but for
this type of content I usually have to
wait until I can I kind of really feel
it for me to force something like that
just I have a hard time doing that and
not making it feel really awkward and
forced it I guess
I will link that video down in the
description though if you guys want to
check it out so feel free to do that
know of a Jetfire next asks are you
going to LTX that's the Linus tech Expo
Dreamhack is setting up a big BYOC area
it's July 27th and 28th 2019 in
Vancouver British Columbia up in Canada
and short answer here is yes current
plan is for me to attend LTX
and we don't have flights booked or
anything like that yet so you know
variables could still lead to me not
going for some reason but intending to
go at this point so if you guys are
gonna be there hopefully I will get to
see you in person and say hello Sparky
energiya is next with more of a comment
than a question but it was winter last
month it's more springtime now if you
guys can tell by my background but he
says it's 400 C in Australia today he's
literally vaporizing at his keyboard
which I imagine you would do if it was
400 C I believe he means for DC but just
checking our conversion here that's 752
degrees Fahrenheit so yeah that would be
very uncomfortable I'm sorry to any of
you Australians out there who might be
going through a very hot summer right
now but I believe the seasons are
changing at the moment so hopefully
things are easing it for you guys but
try to stay cool out there and here's
the last comment from last month and
this is just I wanted to say thank you
guys this is only a smattering of the
various responses I got either saying
congrats on a million subs or congrats
on the new baby girl that I have coming
next month in April it was just awesome
to see all these responses Michael
Taipei Taiwan Chris mark Andre thank you
guys all thanks to everyone else who
posted similar comments down there and I
wanted to give you guys a little bit of
news or just just an update because I am
planning a 1 million subscriber giveaway
although it's a little late at this
point actually hits million subscribers
about three weeks ago it happened while
we were live on the awesome Hardware
live show on a Tuesday evening which was
really cool we got to celebrate it live
and we were drinking and stuff and we
had fun but I think YouTube had
something weird
going on and I didn't get you're
supposed to get a notification once you
hits like a hundred thousand or a
million subscribers it says hey congrats
and here's a code and then you use that
code to redeem your award which in this
case is going to be my gold play button
which I'm really really looking forward
to get I wanted to do a giveaway
announcements at the same time as
unboxing that gold award and everything
and sharing it with you guys and saying
thank you and everything fortunately as
of yesterday the code came through I was
able to redeem it I'm expecting that to
arrive hopefully within the next week or
two and at that point I will be kicking
off a pretty huge giveaway which I tried
to make as international as possible so
whether you're watching from the US or
North America or anywhere in the world
do you still be eligible for a decent
amount of prizes more details on that
coming soon though but guys that's gonna
wrap it up for this video I really
wanted to say thank you once again for
all of your questions feel free to leave
me more down in the comments section for
next month really really looking forward
to the rest of this year because it's
starting out pretty great so thanks
again guys thumbs up button on your way
out we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
