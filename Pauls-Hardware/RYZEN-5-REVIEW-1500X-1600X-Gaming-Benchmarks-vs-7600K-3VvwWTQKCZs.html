ambi launched their rise in five lineup
of CPUs today with four new processors
sporting either four cores with eight
threads or six cores with 12 threads
this should prove to be an exciting
launch as the archives are priced
between 170 and 250 US dollars the 1400
and 1500 X at 170 and 190 respectively
with four cores and eight threads in the
1600 and 1600 X at 220 and 250 with six
cores and twelve threads all CPUs are
unlocked for overclocking when paired
with a B 350 or X 370 chipset and four
motherboard so although I'll only be
testing the 1500 X and 1600 X today I
think the 1,400 and 1,600 will be the
chips to get if you're willing to do a
bit of overclocking on your own speaking
of which I'll be back tomorrow as well
with this video dedicated to
overclocking right in five CPUs so get
subscribe to my channel if you're not
already and make sure you turn those
notifications on to so you won't miss it
for today I want to focus on performance
benchmarks rather than the architecture
details and specs that you guys probably
already know about if you've been
following right in for the past month so
here's a rundown of what I will be
comparing the unlocked core core for 576
hundred K from Intel has been the go-to
processor first white quite some time
when it comes to building a gaming PC so
that will be the primary competition
from the Intel side I've also got the 8
core 16 thread Rison 7 1702 pit against
the 1500 X and 1600 X giving us a core
course race test configurations are
always tricky to decide on so here's my
mo for today I wanted to overclock but I
wanted to keep things reasonable so I'm
running everything reasonably
overclocked I chose speeds that I think
just about anybody can hit with some
basic overclocking and maybe a 30 to 50
dollar air cooler so my rise in CPUs are
all running at 3.9 gigahertz on all
cores and my 7600 K is at 4.8 Gertz on
all course this should represent the low
end of the overclocking ranges that
these chips can all hit and it should
also be a suitable 24
seven overclock depending on your
specific silicon of course if you're
trying to dial the same thing at home
for memory I kind of did the same two
eight gig ddr4 kits running at 29:33 on
both platforms with all timing set to 16
16 16 39 finally I ran all tests with
the same GPU the Galax gtx 1070 EXO c
sniper which was also overclocked so it
was running at about 2000 25 megahertz
on the GPU well under full load so the
questions that i'm hoping to answer
today are will the 1070 perform the same
across all platforms indicating that an
r5 1400 plug board is all you really
need will AMD's performance at 1080 can
continue to suffer compared to the 7600
k with its better instructions per clock
performance and can we finally build a
really nice gaming PC for less than
$1000 it has more than four freaking
threads at its disposal let's run down
the hardware I'm using and then dive
into the benchmarks so for our m4 system
we have an Asus crosshair 6 hero
motherboard this is an X 370 chipset
board so do bear that in mind be 350 is
what AMD recommends you pair and r5 with
but for the sake of comparison to some
older benchmarks as well as
forward-looking to my overclocking
videos I'm going to be doing very soon
so I stuck with the crosshair 6 hero for
storage have a patriot hellfire m2 nvme
SSD it's a 480 gig version so that's
giving us a little bit of extra
performance on the storage side but
shouldn't really affect the benchmarks
at all everything's powered by a course
our HX 1000 I have power supply and 4
memory at the G scale flare X 3200 speed
kit although I have down clock that's a
29 33 just for this test if you're
interested to see how far that can go
again
I'm going to be following up with an
overclocking video very soon and I for
cooling eyes of course there H 100 IB 2
which is a bit overkill for this
platform but again wanted to stick with
that when I do overclocking testing as
well in the future and I'm very
confident that these chips given their
low TDP of 65 watts will be able to be
handled by any 35 to 50 ish dal or air
cooler that you might find as well for
the Intel system I have the gigabyte Z
270x gaming 7 motherboard for cooling I
have the Corsair H 110 liquid CPU cooler
for memory I have the HyperX predator
3200 speed kit although it again it was
set to 2933 with the timings I already
listed and finally for storage you have
the Intel 600 P and
vme SSD in the 512 gig version and now
finally we can dive into the benchmarks
starting with Cinebench r15 of course
and for these first couple benchmarks I
do is include the 7700 K and FX 8350
performance because I do have some
numbers for those but the 1700 of course
destroying everything else with its
multi-threaded performance with all 12
I'm sorry all 16 of its beds available
followed up by the 1600 X to the 7700 km
7600 K looking at the single thread
performance numbers here the 7600 K with
a score of 205 definitely has the
advantage here when it comes to the
single thread score but we'll see if
that helps up through the rest of the
benchmarks now to handbrake just Rhian
coding a 4k video down to 1080 the
fastest times are the winner here and of
course the 1,700 wins again with all of
its threads 1600 X coming in second with
the time just shy of 10 minutes followed
by the 7700 K and 7600 K 7600 K
definitely being helped up by its 4.8
gigahertz overclock there and actually
almost catching up to the 7700 K and
then we have the 1500 X bringing up the
rear here unfortunately
SMT did not seem to help it overtake the
7600 K in this test
moving into the gaming benchmarks
starting with the synthetic 3d mark
firestrike ultra here we can see the
overall score remaining roughly the same
for all of these systems so that would
tell us that we don't necessarily need
if all we're doing is testing 3d mark of
course we don't necessarily need the
higher end processor like you might need
with the 7600 K or 1700 however you do
see a pretty huge difference when it
comes to the civics test which is the
more CPU focused test and 3d mark and we
will again see how that continues to
play out with the rest of the benchmarks
beauty mark times pi is a DirectX 12
benchmark also synthetic of course and
here we can see the r7 1700 shining and
both the overall performance as well as
the CP performance 1600 X as well I
think largely due to that CPU score was
able to overtake the 7600 K in this test
so in situations when the CPU is taking
more into account than the GPU you can
see better performance from the 1600 X
to the 7600 K moving into actual games
this is GTA 5 at 1080 and I'm running
all these benchmarks by the way at 1080
and 1440 here we can see the 1500 X
kind of starting to tank and I think
this is going to be a continued
in trend as we see that for Korres is
not quite keeping up as well as it
should of course depending on what
you're doing
the 7600 K did seems to do all rights
although it again trailed behind the
1600 X and the 1700 you also pay
attention to the low scores here these
would be 1% and 0.1% to slowest frame
times so it's a bit better way of
determining if you're going to see any
choppiness compared to just showing the
minimum frame rate at 1440 we see a
little bit more of an equalization when
it comes to the 7600 K 1600 X and 1700
with the 1500 X again showing that in a
CPU bound somewhat CPU bound game like
GTA 5 that does like more CPU
performance and more threads a 1500 X
isn't quite keeping up the 7600 K did
still do a good job although you can see
it's starting to trail when it comes to
those low scores sieve 6 is kind of an
odd game to benchmark I did it at 1080
and 1440 and it didn't show that much of
a difference between the two resolutions
which I think it's kind of funny for a
game like this I think there's some
scaling thing going on but it does show
that it does like more threads more
cores with the CPU as a 1600 X and 1700
definitely came out with the win here
albeit by a sort of slim margin 7600 K
coming in third and then the 1500 X
trailing behind once again at 1440 we
see a little bit more of equivalency we
actually see a slightly higher effort
framerate which is weird since this
compared to 1080 it's said yeah I don't
have a very good explanation for that
but again we can see that most of the
CPUs are keeping up with the sentence
evety whereas 1500 X is again falling
behind a bit moving on the Metro last
light still a very relevant game when it
comes to benchmarking performance and
here again we can see the 1500 X Knox
like keeping up 7600 K doing a little
bit better than that 1600 X and 1700
stick and right with it I do want again
point to the low scores on the 7600
being a little bit lower than I might
expect actually and I do want a
reference here that when it comes to
smoothness and gaming that's sort of
been reference with the rise in
processors quite a bit and I've tried to
pay attention to it a little bit more I
know it's sort of anecdotal but I did
feel like all the benchmarks when I was
running it felt very smooth on the Rison
system so so the zero percent scores are
something to be taken into consideration
especially looking at Metro last light
here in 1440 we can see that the 7600 K
the highest average framerate but did
seem to suffer when it came to those
0.1% lows and that was indicative of
some of the bits of hitches and stutters
that I saw while the benchmark was
actually running Witcher 3 at 1080 saw
roughly equivalent scores across all the
chips although we do see a bit of it
step down as we go down the line 1500 X
actually came up big here outperforming
to 1700 and 1,600 X which I thought was
was kind of interesting but the the
performance really isn't that far off
with any of them although we can see
here again the 7600 cake coming away
with the best average framerate but
again the worst to zero percent one low
score moving out of 1440 the game
becomes a little bit more GPU bound than
CPU bounds so the CPU doesn't matter
quite as much although we do again see
the 1500 X coming in last everything
else performing roughly equivalently the
7600 K coming out with a bit of a win by
about 3 or 4 frames per second
moving on to overwatch the 1500 X
actually at a really good score here 194
average and very good 0% to 0.1% lows as
well the 7600 K I have no very good
explanation for in this test I'll be
perfectly honest this is the very last
test of all of the benchmarks that I ran
went to 7600 K I came out with just some
anomalous numbers I tried to investigate
every ran the test several times I don't
have a good explanation for this but
just bear in mind take that one at least
with a grain of salt because it was the
last benchmark I ran and I didn't have
time to investigate it further if I move
to 1440 though you'll see the scores are
pretty much the same across the board
there was really minimal variance 7600 K
did have a lower 0.11% scores in this
one but by and large it was still the
same so no good explanation for my 1080
scores at 7600 K but all-in-all
overwatch is easily handled by any of
these processors I've already mentioned
that I'm using fairly high-end coolers
for these all-in-one closed-loop coolers
of 240 rad on that one and a 280 rad on
the in cell one but I do still mana list
temps I did measure them at least with
the rise in processors I was measuring
with the rise in master software at the
peak temperature during my hand breaking
code hits 73 degrees Celsius at the
hottest on the r7 1700 that does have a
higher GDP
so that kind of makes sense 7600 K
withstand pretty chilly 72 degrees at
4.8 gigahertz bear in mind that these
different CPUs rise in verses Intel have
different charts when it comes to the
actual peak temperatures that they can
hit so 72 is on the cooler side for
insel weather whereas it's a little bit
more on the warmer side for ambi 1600 X
hit 65 degrees at 3.9 gigahertz and the
1500 hit X hit only 56 degrees that is
one of the nice benefits of having a
quad core support opposed to the sixth
course is they do generate less heat
I found slide here is a frames per
dollar slide and basically I took all of
the actual gaming tests not the
synthetics added up the frame rate for
them this is not the most scientific way
of doing it but I wanted to give some
sort of aggregate here at the ends so
the total frames produced by all the
cards are listed there and then the
retail prices are also listed their
current MSRP for the AMD chips and then
the current retail price at new leg for
the 7600 state which was 240 bucks here
we can see when it comes to frames per
dollar or frames per 100 dollars
we're actually getting the best bang for
our buck out of the r5 1500 X but that
is largely in part thanks to its lower
price by about good 60 bucks we have
actually pretty dead heat when it comes
to the 7600 caber since the 1600 X and I
would say though that the performance of
the 1600 X and non-gaming situations
would push me over the edge to towards
getting the 1600 x over 270 over the
7600 K 1700 obviously comes down a bit
when it comes to your bang for the buck
but you are getting additional cores and
threads there which again would be
useful for non gaming situations but
this is a big reason I think why people
were excited about the RF is for gaming
is because you're not paying for that
extra performance that you're not going
to use with the games the only thing for
your fork or a fixed core part which
you're going to get a lot more use of
when it comes to actual PC gaming so
overall I am pleased as punch with the
rise in v lineup and even more so after
doing some direct comparisons to intel's
gaming performance obviously the higher
thread and core counts for the r5 s give
them a huge edge in any computing task
that takes advantage of those multiple
threads but even the gaming performance
seems to be at least up to par with a
okay with some back and forth depending
on the gaming question there has been
clear evidence in the past month that
aim DS rise in CPUs have a lot of power
still left under the hood and game
optimizations as well as leveraging
higher ram speeds for example has both
already been shown to draw out more
untapped performance I think the best
value an archive lineup will probably be
the 1400 or the 1600 paired with some
overclocking which I will be showing you
guys how to do in my next video but for
those who just want that out-of-the-box
experience that excuse are still decent
bangs for the Bucks you just you know if
you want to just plug it in and have it
run at a higher frequency I would also
say that if you're planning to stick
with 1920 by 1080 gaming for a while
you'll be ok with the 1400 or 1500 X but
if you want to game at 1440 or high
refresh rate 1080 or if you want to
delve into streaming or video editing
then the 6 core 1600 or 1600 X is
definitely worth the investment and hey
another seldom mentioned benefit of the
am 4 platform overall is that you can
buy a cheap quad core like a 1400 and
still have an upgrade path to an 8 core
CPU in the future without swapping your
motherboard so there you have it guys
another exciting launch from AMD that I
think a lot more home builders will be
able to get excited about since the
price range is a more reasonable I want
to close with a general statement about
product launches like this though get a
second opinion I've done a lot of work
in the past few days to get this video
produced and test these chips but
there's a ton of other youtubers and
tech websites out there they're also
covering these chips with alternate
configurations testing more games at
various other resolutions and generally
providing you guys with the information
that you need to make a buying decision
if you're on the fence right now so I'll
be perusing some of those this morning
and adding those links to this video's
description so you guys can have
someplace to go for further viewing
and/or reading that is all for this
video though stay tuned for the
overclocking video coming very soon hit
that like button share this video if you
found it useful at all subscribe for
more videos coming very soon and of
course check out the description for the
