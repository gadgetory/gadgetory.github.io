to Paul's Hardware today is my monthly
build for December 2018 I'm building the
system and you could possibly win it
during our charity livestream which is
happening very soon on December 8th from
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
will you join us there you should team
group ste force Delta gaming memory
modules are available in a wide variety
of speeds and capacities and feature
full frame ultra wide-angle RGB lighting
aluminum heat spreaders and
compatibility with current gen RGB
lighting control software click the
sponsor link in the description to learn
more I also wanted to say Merry
Christmas and Happy Holidays to any of
you guys out there who happened to
celebrate during this joyous time of
year but in today's system we have an
assortment of parts that I've chosen not
necessarily because they are the best
parts that match with each other but
they're all parts that I actually had
here to build the system with that's not
to say you couldn't assemble this system
together yourself it's pretty well
balanced I've got 16 gigs of memory a
Rison 1600 x as well as a mini ITX case
and motherboard and a 500 watt power
supply let's go over the parts real
quick so at the heart of the system here
we have the Rison 5 1600 X which is a 6
core 12 thread processor a very capable
processor and also unlocked for
overclocking just going to be pairing
that with the Wraith stealth or I'm
sorry the Wraith spire cooler which is
the stock cooler it comes with but it is
a very adequate cooler and also hangs on
pretty well for shipping which is
important since I will be shipping this
to a winner eventually we also have 16
gigs of Corsair Vengeance ddr4 memory
this is 2 by 8 gig kit and the memory
that's actually in there this is a box
I'm repurposing but the memory is 3000
speed and yes it plays very nicely with
Rison so I'll get that all installed and
set up before the system goes out for a
main storage drive we have the Toshiba
OC zr c 100 which is a very small but
quite quick little nvme SSD 480 gigs on
there so plenty of room for your
operating system and some games as well
and that will be all the storage that's
you need to get started and of course
there is some expandability with some
3.5 inch drive bays in the Rio Toro CR
2080 I have built with this case before
it's nice because it can support
full-size power supplies and it's also
relatively small it's not the tiniest
mini ITX case you get a side panel
window and it's put together pretty well
we've also got an EVGA 500 BQ 80 plus
bronze raid
power supply this has all black cabling
and that should be enough to support our
graphics card which is the geforce gtx
1070 TI this is from EVGA and it is
their superclocked version and then of
course we need a motherboard to tie
everything together so we got the ROG
Strix B 450 - I gaming motherboard from
Asus which features the a m4 socket of
course but also its Mini ITX so it will
fit the case and it's got a nice feature
set as well including support for or a
sync via several RGB headers so those
are all the parts I'm going to put this
together
come along ok
so sport has a heat spreader for the
m-dot to drive removing that we can see
several mounting places depending on the
length 22 42 is right here and that's
actually where a support is for our
drive since this Toshiba RC 100 is very
very tiny so if we install like this we
actually can't mount it right there
there's a little extensions you can do
that will let you mount it kind of to
here from there but since we got this
heat spreader on top I think that's
gonna hold it in place just fine so I'll
simply remove this label that says
remove and put it on people often ask me
why I don't remove the sticker on this
as well and most SSD manufacturers
actually make this label thermally
conductive so you don't need to remove
it because why would they want you to do
branded their thing
Oh hold no I'm thinking about it
this was Joe's suggestion this little
stopper here ah that's probably a bit
better so future reference this little
stopper guide can be removed I'm just
gonna move it down here so it stays in
case whoever wins decides to swap out
this SSD for any reason then we can use
the standard 22 42 mount for right there
there is but that's a full-length one
these are you see how there's a kind of
a nut so these are a little bit yeah
that's that's that's okay I think maybe
no no all right Joe I think you're right
about everything I don't know I didn't
know that okay now that you mentioned
that I think you're right again it's not
being right about everything Joe so just
to point out how Joe was right here and
I was wrong he suggested that I take
this one off of the existing mount and
use it and I was like no these shorter
ones are what it wants you to use but
actually those little shorter ones are
for the mount on the back of the
motherboard back here if you need to
install it there and we discovered that
when we use those up here it sort of put
the SSD at a bit of a decline there and
we don't want that so you'll move this
up to here again this was all Joe's idea
Paul's Paul's solution would have been
wrong and terrible it's okay power of
teamwork solved the problem oh yeah
people gave me that name Joe Joe Joe
there we go to juggle much more level
yeah that was an extensive amount of
time to spend on the m2 installation i
pro tip for anyone who's assembling a
this system or something close to it the
supplemental cpu power for this
motherboard it is in a very difficult to
reach location the very top left corner
there so it very much recommends
plugging that in maybe as you install
the motherboard I was able to get it
plugged in fortunately I did have to
remove this rear exhaust fan but that
wasn't too bad now I can remount that
and we can continue my initial build in
this case I discovered actually had a
graphic scribe that was a little bit
bigger still fit in here but I found
that adding a front intake fan here
provided a little bit more air for that
this card is a little bit smaller so
it's able to fit in without too much
difficulty and it's also got a little
fan setup that I think will treat it a
little bit better alright guys this
system is pretty much put together at
least as far as all the internal stuff
goes and stuff plugged in side panels I
have not put this side panel on yet but
I have plugged in the power so we can
give ourselves a quick test boot the
initial power switch is turned on and we
have some standby power so that's good
and now did I do front panels properly
found the power button there it is hey
it looks like we have a successful boot
fantastic so I'm gonna install windows
on this so it's ready to go for the
winner in the meantime though that is
all the time I have for this video so
thank you guys so much for watching and
again this will be given away it's gonna
be a giveaway that lasts about a week so
you guys will have plenty of time to
enter we're gonna be kicking that
giveaway off with a charity livestream
event that we're gonna be streaming from
right here on December 8th which is
Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.
Pacific time we'll be on our twitch
channels mine Paul's hardware as well as
Kyle's all
stuff will be linked on the video
description so check it out if you're
interested thanks for joining me today
but that is pretty much all the time I
have for today I am very happy that the
system came together I hope you guys
like it too and of course links to the
parts they used are down in the video's
