burger for today's video I'm going to be
building an AMD system no it's not a
rising system if it was I would have put
that in the title I promise but I was
curious how long has it actually been
since I built an Andy based system not
talking graphics cards and talking me
CPU and the kind of the core level
components also I need a shave and a
haircut so I'm going to keep my face out
of the rest of this video so the answer
as far as I can tell is this video right
here I built this around Christmas time
in 2015 so that makes it about 14 months
or so and this is actually a 78 50 K
build so it was an APU which means it
wasn't even the platform that I'm going
to be building on today today I'm great
there's nothing here I get to go
shopping a shopping trip here in my
garage actually I really have done next
to no pre checking to make sure I have
the things that I need for this build so
I sure do hope that I have them all
let's start over here with a motherboard
and since this is going to be a full-on
am-3 build let's go with the 990 FX over
here little saber-tooth 990 this is the
revision 2.0 not the 1.0 I need a 2.0
8350 I hope it's actually in here
success we have any a350 alright so that
will be our processor go ahead and add
that to the little pile now this is
going to be a test bed so just just to
clarify things for no reason in
particular I'm setting up several test
beds this one of course is the one I
have been using for Intel this is e 270
set up on the gigabyte z 270x gaming
seven or Oris depending on which brand
you like to use better down here I have
old and neglected a test bed so I think
this one is probably going to be the
best bet my LAN Lee PC is called this is
this is called the pitstop
it's top t60 whatever it also has this
on here so let's get rid of that oh my
god that's dusty cool so the T 60 seems
to have cleaned up fairly well you know
it's not perfect or anything but it did
come pre equipped with an antic I think
this is a high current pro 1200 watt
power supply hideous cables of course
but not too concerned about aesthetics
for this particular build so that gives
me a case or testbed power supply that's
to motherboard processor that OB 3 &amp;amp; 4
except I do not have a cooler okay now I
have a cooler let's just stick the hyper
212 Evo that one's simple enough to
install all right so that's four of
seven I need storage memory and and one
last thing graphics card graphics card
shouldn't be too tough to find and I do
know where storage is kept right over
here by my cpu pile most of these down
here actually much older SSDs that are
like 40 gigs or about about that range
so those are mainly being kept for
historical significance memory I do have
a little memory drawer right here need
some ddr3 this is exactly how memory is
supposed to be stored
nobody would you be worried about that
so ddr4 I think this kid is the year 3
yes yes ddr3 all right we'll go with
these g.skill ripjaws the Ripjaws z and
here's an SSD that should work too hyper
X this is a what is this Savage
I think it's a savage I believe that's
what this one's called anyway it's 240
gig Kingston HyperX Drive that's
actually already got a Windows 10
installation although it was installed
on x99 I'll probably just wipe this and
and go with go with a clean install for
it but I believe that is almost
everything alright so here's our memory
this was a 32 gig kit but actually I am
just going to install 16 of those gigs
just so it matches
with the Z 270 testbed over there so 16
gigs ddr3 240 you got 64 operating
system z2 70 build has a 1080 on it so
let's get another 10 80 and 60 this
would be a 1080 but I don't think it's
actually in there oh that one's in the
Mini ITX built let's pull let's pull the
let's pull the standard 1080 out of this
mini ITX build that'll work
cool it looks like my shopping is all
finished
so again Liam Lee TC no McKenley pitstop
T 60 is what this testbed is called 1200
watt antec power supply the ACS
sabertooth 990 FX revision 2.0 the 8350
of course cpu from AMD the hyper 212 evo
and sexually my main question is making
sure I have a m3 + mounting solutions
for that and then of course 16 gigs of
GCL memory type RX to 40 gig SSD and the
GTX 1080 when I'm actually doing game
testing I'll probably stick with the
founders Edition 1080 and just swap it
between the different systems I have but
at least for now this will allow me to
get everything set up installed and
drivers updated and all that good stuff
so yeah here goes
put this together first AMD buildin the
first 990 FX buildin like I don't know I
want to say like two years two and a
half years in a while
all right so the announcing back plate
for the hyper 212 Evo has been installed
not terribly complicated but probably
the most difficult part of this
particular particular assembly although
again wasn't to bet
and I got up this standoff I wasn't too
hard and then I think I can orient this
this way that's how I would usually do
it you know pull an air that direction
at the back I might I can also rotate it
that way if necessary but I find that
that sometimes conflicts with the top
GPU slot there so I'll go for this
direction I think I just have to figure
out how I figured okay
yeah I think it goes like that see the
trick is even though you want it to be
this way
let's get it make it go that way first
so you can fit through there - yeah yeah
everything's falling apart right and
then you can move it back we actually
want it to be and it should rest
the old center thing there in the middle
and now I have taught you guys how to
install the cooler that's been out for
like six years
and then we just just gotta set it down
like that and everything should line up
and be in focus yeah I'll probably want
to put some thermal paste on there too
the surface is prepared for thermal
mating the thermal mating juice is being
applied excellent and now this goes on
top
last tricky bit is these little does
this have to be positioned where they
should be all right good looks good
lowering lowering we have contact
get these screws started excellent of
course we're mounting in a star pattern
starting with opposite corners and so on
and so forth and now we just pop the fan
back on oh you know what we should do
the memory first of course the memory
never forget the memory
perfect should have had mounting screws
ready that I did not and all right here
it is I actually really like how test
beds look when they're like outfitted
and everything I know it's very
utilitarian and it's not like clean and
everything and like the cables are
ketchup and mustard and all that good
stuff this is a really nice power supply
but it's not modular at all and the kids
just it's it's from an age before like
having nice clean-looking power supply
cables was really much of a thing apart
from as though it's it's all looking
pretty clean I did do a bit of cable
management over here just just tying
things down to try to keep them out of
the way mainly so that when I sort of
pick this thing up and carry it around
things don't get caught and that's one
of the other things I like about this
test bit of heavy is this part across
the top acts as a handle so you can you
can pick it up and move it around and
whatnot so yeah you know what I should
do is make sure it's actually functional
I should plug it in good idea
okay Hiro is here to supervise I have
everything wired up got a mouse keyboard
a internet connection via via an rj45
cable back there you guys probably need
to hear all that stuff but the moment of
truth I'm also hoping with this front
panel button works also I should turn
the power supply switch on
bitch okay let's try it again certainly
sucked a bit of power right there at the
beginning actually triggered by my ups
down there for a moment
but right they seem to have power fans
spinning
it looks like am3+ is still a viable
platform at least based on first
impressions here we should hopefully be
seeing something on the screen over here
soon as well because I do have the
monitor plugged into that's important
and then I think the first thing I'm
going to do is see if there's an update
for this BIOS update for this
motherboard because I think it's been
sitting on my shelf for a couple years
hey hey hey with that new CPU installed
alright so let let me let me see what
kind of bass updates asus has been
working on for this motherboard for the
past couple years
looks like our current revision is zero
to one nine I have a feeling maybe they
have something a little bit more recent
than that I don't know how well you guys
can see this but set BIOS revisions zero
two one nine is from launch BIOS for
this motherboard through August and
sorry June 25th 2012 and they have had
this many BIOS updates on this
motherboard since then oh oh good lord
so going issues with their BIOS updates
man like wow ok so most recent update
it's from 2016 August 5th so there you
go
I think I'll download this one and undo
the update it should improve system
stability there's a cute flash go on
this thing the glue Advanced Mode
tool easy flash easy flash and none of
my I will USB Drive that I copied the
BIOS to so folks what happened in this
directory there we go yes I do want to
read the file okay oh I guess I assume
that goes because the mouse stops moving
so it must be thinking processing and it
for my like four years of bios of things
it's going through right now this should
should it introduce the vast array of
new functionality to this motherboard
I'm assuming I'll even make it
compatible with like rising GPUs maybe
no no probably not right
all right the magic words update
successfully system will be reset clear
okay
oh what the hell is going on and it's
just about to say hey guys everything is
doing just fine but actually I think
it's doing Windows updates in the
background and it probably just loaded a
new Nvidia driver or something like that
alright so here we go I have actually
just let it load off of that Windows 10
install and it recognized all the
hardware I'm gonna do a clean install
anyway just just so everything's nice
and clean on there but I let it do it
just so I can make sure everything is
recognized so we got our 8350 here turn
on about 1.4 bolts and you know it's 50
Bo's itself up to 4.2 gigahertz
out-of-the-box pro tip if you can
overclock your 8350 to five years you
have a 95 90 95 90 right this is up
steps what the other ones called I'm
pretty sure anyway so yeah everything's
looking pretty good temperature-wise and
everything
temps temps are good so I think my
install of the hyper 212 went just fine
and yeah so this is working
wait hold on okay I've got my face in
this video again so scale of it alright
guys so this little test bed is all
setup and that's pretty much gonna wrap
it up for this video now if you guys are
wondering why the heck and build
and am3+ 990 FX chipset motherboard with
an 8350 processor right now well
according to the news we should be
expecting a brand new launch of a brand
new platform with brand new CPU
architecture and everything Andes Zen
architecture Rison CPUs rumored to be
coming out very soon of course I know
nothing about when they might actually
be launching or anything like that but
when they do I want to be prepared so I
can give a little bit of a comparison of
where they have come from over the past
say five six years that they've been
developing this new platform that
they're finally launching so what I'd
like to hear from you guys down in the
comments below is what types of
comparative tests you'd like to see once
I finally do hopefully assuming
everything is true get my hands on that
CPU and those that platform and start to
do some tests so I'll be able to run
them on here and then give a cross
comparison to the rides and stuff again
theoretically once it comes out as let
me know what you want me to test whether
it be games or productivity stuff and
I'll try to get in a reasonable balance
of whatever you guys suggest so thank
you guys so much for watching this video
hit the thumbs up button if you enjoyed
it I certainly have had a wonderful time
this morning it's really been a while
since I set up a system on this on this
platform so and when we went very
smoothly so that's good too anyway guys
thanks again for watching and leave me
all those comments in the comment
section below and of course if you
enjoyed this video hit that subscribe
button and I'll have more videos on
rides and very soon hopefully have a
good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
