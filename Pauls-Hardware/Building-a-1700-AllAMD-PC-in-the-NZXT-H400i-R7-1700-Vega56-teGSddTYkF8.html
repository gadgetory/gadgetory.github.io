click the link in the description for
more information
so like week or two ago a bunch of
people did videos on NZXT s no case the
H 700 I full tower intelligent case that
the NZXT has integrated some fancy new
technology into to help you connect up
fans connect up RGB and also some
intelligence to control those features
now what I'm gonna do today
theoretically might be your first look
at the smaller version of the H 700 I
this is the H 400 I it's a micro ATX
case also available in a variety of
colors I have the black and red version
today so my focus for today's video is
going to be on this case but to properly
properly demonstrate any case it's best
to build a system in it so I'm actually
gonna be doing an all AMD system today
which is my first all AMD system in like
a really long time I don't know how long
it's been but this is to celebrate the
the AMD Radeon Vega GPUs coming down in
price to reside almost at their MSRP
this is the Radeon Vega 56 and you can
actually get it for four hundred to four
hundred twenty eight dollars at least as
of the filming of this video to go along
with that of course I've got a rise in
CPU which is tucked right down there I'm
actually using the r7 1700 which is the
eight core although if you are planning
on building a system similar to this I
would say the r5 1600 would also be an
excellent choice or the 1600 X if you
can get it for about the same price a
six core would be a good solution here
we're gonna have eight cores though to
keep our CPU cool we have the NZXT
Kraken X 62 which will fit in this case
even though it is a very large radiator
280 millimeter using two 140 millimeter
fans for memory I have a Corsair
Vengeance led kit I'm gonna try the
white version of that kit although we do
have some RGB LEDs in here too and we'll
see how it looks and I might swap it out
the color scheme in case you didn't
already realize was black red
whites the whites primarily is going to
be provided by the accent coloring on
our motherboard here the asrock may be
350 mm pro 4 and if you're looking for a
micro ATX amp or motherboard that
supports rise in CPUs that looks pretty
nice and that has the features that
you'd wants on a motherboard like four
dimm slots as well as MDOT to support
this board has it and it's only about 75
bucks the be 350 chipset also means that
it does allow overclocking of the rise
in CPU and it does have some cooling on
the power delivery for the CPU as well
so hopefully we can get a bit of an
overclock out of that too we of course
need to power the system so we have the
Corsair V 650 power supply which is
going to get the job done it's 80 plus
gold rated and it has all black cabling
and finally for storage we have a new
budget oriented SSD from OCZ Toshiba
this is the TR 200 480 gig version of it
here this is available in 480 and 240
gig capacities and we just wanted an SSD
and I didn't want one that was too
expensive so there you go let's go ahead
and get this build underway
so I got the H 400 I out of the box and
let's stick first look at it of course
smaller sibling to the H 700 i if you
watched any of the coverage on that and
there's been excellent coverage by the
likes of hardware connects and gamers
Nexus so first off you're probably going
to notice this sort of redesigned cable
management bracket right here that they
put in it's all red and it's it's got
sort of an angular bit and this is meant
to allow you to conveniently write your
cables along that in order to access
things such as your power for your
motherboard or your graphics card coming
out right there so we'll see how that
works out pre-installed we have a couple
hundred and twenty millimeter fans here
at the front as well as a single hundred
and twenty millimeter exhaust fan there
at the back
top has an exhaust area here with a
removable sorry my wobbly lazy susan is
wobbly removable magnetically outlined
dust filter so that is nice to have and
up there we have support for 240 as well
as 280 mm meter radiators up here for
front i/o we have mic and headphone jack
a couple USB 3.0 and a power button if I
was to ask for anything on modern cases
it's going to be the addition of a USB
type-c preferably a USB 3.1 gen2
compatible type-c connector but you do
have the basics covered up there for
what it's worth beyond that we have a
basement down in the bottom well we have
a 2.5 inch mount right there that I'm
probably actually not going to use
simply because our ocz Drive does not
match our color scheme at all I have no
fear if that's the case for you you got
a couple more 2.5 inch drive mounts
there on the back you have this cable
management area here as well that I
really like because there's a couple
different channels going up either side
as well as velcro straps going across
them and of course easy access to feed
them through here with some protection
from visibility from the front by that
cable management
get that goes down there and here you
also find power which is going to
provide power for this central hub right
here which is part of their entire mo
for this series is providing it a little
bit easier way to connect up fans LEDs
and control them also power their USB
connection to get to your motherboard
for control via the cam software LED out
and then a one two and three fan
connection points there as well you've
also got dust filter down here on the
bottom for the power supply so that's
nice access from the back snaps into
place and then for general airflow in
the front most air flow is going to come
in the side here via these small circle
holes that are kind of perforated in the
side here this is also of course one of
the colored accent pieces that is on
either side you are black blocked from
the direct front but that will block
some of the noise of course coming from
your intake fans and then down here
they've also continued that sort of
circular hole scheme that this one has
sort of a gradient effect since it goes
from smaller holes to larger holes from
the front to the back it's kind of a
cool thing cool looking I like it in our
accessory kits we have a set of screws
of course some zip ties it's very handy
to have along especially if you don't
have those on hands from prior builds
looks like you get a couple extra
standoffs in there they did put the
stand-ups in there for mini ITX as well
as not full micro ATX but in any way I
gotta add a couple RGB strip though they
have actually included two this one
comes with it is magnetic there we go
give you a little extension as well for
it and there is a second RGB strip that
is pre-installed although it might be
hard to see but it's right up there
along the top edge so that one's in
there for you and then the second one
they've included and they say just put
that one wherever it works best for your
build
front panel up here is made of metal so
that is nice and still removes in the
classic way that front panels usually
remove with some prongs in there that
latch into the case itself
there's also hidden beneath here a
pretty wide dust filter and that is so
you can set up various configurations up
here with the 240 or 280 millimeter
radiators we're of course gonna be
installing the kraken so we'll show you
how much space you got there but there's
a lot of space for radiators and I
imagine push-pull configurations
depending on the thickness of your
radiator and all that's but for now now
we're gonna get these fans out of here
it was really nice and convenient of
NZXT to pre wire all of these cables
coming down here however if you're
removing all these then it becomes less
convenient but that's not to say they
shouldn't have done it
they did a good job there but bear in
mind it's all wired in there pretty
tight so you're gonna need to go in
there and fish out some of your fan
headers to unplug speaking of splitters
these connections all have splitters on
the end so the fan 1 fan 2 and fan 3
from the little unit up there all has
three plugs on each end which means you
can just out-of-the-box connect up up to
nine fans to that device
as to make sure this build was as NZXT
as possible they did send over some
extra fans and the fans are RGB and we
know how much people love our G B so the
top 140 fans and the rear 120 fan we're
gonna replace NZXT air RGB 140 s and the
kit that we have here also comes with
the Q controller a hue + controller so
we'll use that to connect these up it's
a little Q plus it's a nice little
device controls LEDs especially made by
NZXT individually addressable LEDs which
allows you to do some pretty cool
effects with it
discovered a shortcoming here with this
case and compatibility which is that our
2.5 inch drive mounts the one in the
back here this is a very thick unit by
the way so this isn't going to be a
problem with pretty much any SSD on the
market but won't fit back here there's
simply not enough space there for the
side panel to go on so bear that in mind
if you're we're thinking of installing
it there also we have our bling amount
spot here for an SSD and it's a little
bit too wide to fit there either
unfortunately which we're gonna been a
cool spot for it because it does have a
little LED light on it that lights up
but that would definitely conflict with
the tempered glass side panel windows so
we are left with only one place to put
this which is on the bottom of the case
not physically on the bottom but mounted
to the bottom of the case at the very
bottom in the power supply section
there's a dual mount here so you got
these wider mounts for mounting a 3.5
inch drive or these smaller mounts for
doing a 2.5 inch drive so we're gonna
pop it in right there
so guys at this point I thought we might
be a little bit further along but the
fact is that when you're attempting to
connect up a bunch of RGB all at once
and you want it to be addressable and
that kind of thing there are some
potential complications our main issue
that we encountered was that our
motherboard here has two of the
requisite USB 2.0 headers on the
motherboard itself that you need to
connect up the devices that NZXT has
produced in order to control RGB as well
as fans so of course you got the smart
device that's integrated with H 400 i
right here and that means a USB 2.0
connection you also have our NZXT hue
plus which also needs a USB 2 connection
and then we also have the the RGB
control as well as connection for the
the NZXT control panel so you can
monitor temps and speeds and everything
and that also unique needs a USB 2.0
connection which the cable for that is
lying around here somewhere anyway I was
attempting to see if I could daisy chain
more the fans together in order to get
away with only having two of these
connected but that's not really the best
idea NZXT isn't for me that's when
you're talking about connecting up these
different RGB devices that they have
created you can daisy chain up to four
LED strips together or up to four of the
fans they're fans together but you don't
want to do both at the same time so you
want to have fans going on the same
daisy chain or a couple of LED strips
also in order to accommodate our need
for additional USB 2 headers we have the
NZXT internal USB hub which they had
included in the box and which I had
completely neglected to remember was
even NIC this allows you to take a
simple USB 2.0 header on your
motherboard and split it out into one to
three more plus a couple actual internal
USB ports USB 2.0 ports themselves so
we're going to install this that will
allow us to connect up all the devices
that we need in order to control all the
LEDs
there's a nice little feature only just
realized this was a thing but removable
front tray for your radiator for your
all-in-one or otherwise cooler which is
convenient because if you need to do
something like pass those tubes through
there something like that it makes that
a bit easier to do
I had a moment of confusion here because
looking at the front panel connections
from this case you've got of course your
USB 2.0 which is mainly coming from that
smart hub there and USB 2.0 is a 10 pin
block it's got one pin that's blanked
out so you don't accidentally for
instance plug it into an HD audio port
which is the same sized block but has a
different blanked out pin so you can't
get these confused I suddenly saw what I
thought was another USB 2.0 header
coming from the fronts and got confused
and then realized now this is front
panel front panel connectors in a little
block the same size as a USB 2.0 pin out
header which is actually pretty
convenient provided your motherboard has
this same exact configuration which our
asrock motherboard does as far as I can
tell so that's cool just keep an eye out
and remember they you and I'll have
potentially three different little ten
pin blocks to distinguish between in
your case or in my case whatever the
case may be there's a ribbon shot for
you
well everyone we have now theoretically
finished this build although I will say
that I have a lot of cables wedged down
in there in the basement area down here
for the power supply and I did it fairly
unceremoniously so hopefully nothing
will go wrong when I hit the power
button right now of course I need to hit
the power switch first and then hit the
power button oh hey all right we're
seeing initial success all the fans are
spinning though and in my professional
opinion I'd much rather have spinning
fans than fancy LEDs so what I ended up
having to do is swap out the memory yeah
the Corsair Vengeance led kit that I
initially installed in there just would
not boot in any way shape or form
even after I did get the system up and
running and went to did a BIOS update to
the latest one and went back and
attempted to put it back in there
there's no dice on that one it's not on
the compatibility list for this asrock
motherboard so I guess that's not too
unexpected but I would have liked at
least like to have seen like a BIOS
screen or something with that anyway
though I did swap in the corsair
dominator Platinum kit that I have which
is a 2 by 16 gig kit so there's 32 gigs
of memory in here now that's the ddr4
3000 speed kit that worked just fine
fortunately and also matches the color
scheme with a silver top since white
LEDs and as you can maybe also not tell
I've got the LEDs up and running with
the cam software one thing I want to
point out when I first got the system
booted up and everything after I had
gotten Windows installed I had actually
unplugged all the USBs because I was
having issues getting things booted up
and started
even after I reconnected the USBs the
lights on the air fans still were not
lighting up but I actually had to
install the cam software within Windows
and then they lit up and were able to
sync and it did a firmware update on the
hue plus and now you have the beautiful
candy cane light show that I have got
set up right now which is just using the
Marquis effect which will change the
lights going along all the individually
addressable LEDs on each of the round
air fans as
well as the LED strip that's up here at
the front cam software allows you to
individually change the lighting
configuration for the stuff that's
connected to the NZXT smart device which
has connection for one of those
addressable LEDs the hue plus as well as
the NZXT Krakens so pretty cool they can
configure all those and then it does
have a sync all function as well that
didn't work for me at first attempt but
I kind of ran out of time there and I
had to finish off this video so I am
pretty happy with this build ultimately
even though I did have some issues
getting it up and running once it was
all put together the cable management is
definitely challenging though if you're
trying to connect up all the stuff that
I have connected up in here now and the
XC stated goal with this case was to
take the modern PC building challenges
of integrating a bunch of fans liquid
cooling as well as RGB and when you're
taking a bunch of different RGB devices
they're all individually addressable RGB
LEDs you have to have the cables all
going the same direction and everything
like that so it is definitely
challenging it definitely adds a huge
amount of extra work to the builds if
you're not doing that type of thing so
bear that in mind but you can get it in
the end result that looks like this and
for what it's worth I think NZ NZXT has
taken a pretty challenging situation
with all the cables in different ways
you have to go and made it a lot easier
by providing labels of each end for
which way they're supposed to go and
very well-written documentation so you
can take a look at that to sort of
figure out how you're actually supposed
to connect everything up and yeah just a
little bit of trial and error and you
can probably get it going just like I
did here ultimately though I really like
the H 400 I I'm a big fan I'm kind of a
sucker for microc ATX cases anyway you
have an extremely powerful system right
here and you even have a decent amount
of expandability with an accessible m
dot 2 slot they're a full length PCIe
although I believe it's a buy for
connection down there at the bottoms so
you could add a TV tuner card or maybe a
video capture card or maybe a 10 gigabit
ethernet card down the road so great job
NZXT on the H 400 I will say that I have
not investigated the I part of this case
the intelligence automatic sound and
fan adjustment features that are
integrated there so let me know in the
comments if you'd like me to take a look
at that or further address the
performance of the system since this
wasn't necessarily one of my monthly
builds I wasn't planning to go and test
it but I might if there is enough
interest so leave those comments in the
comment section and of course thumbs up
button on your way out and subscribe to
my channel for more videos just like
this one thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
