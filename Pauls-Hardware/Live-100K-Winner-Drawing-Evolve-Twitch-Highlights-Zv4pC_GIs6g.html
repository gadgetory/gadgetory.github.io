Paul's hardware this is a very special
Paul's hardware video and it might look
a little bit grainy and stuff because
I'm actually live streaming right now
this video and I'm also recording it so
you might be watching in the future you
might be watching it now either way
thanks for joining me and what this
video is all about is me giving a
computer away now that's already in the
past so if you're just now joining I'm
sorry but you can't enter to win but I'm
going to be picking the winner live
right now that's the plan at least and
you're going to win this no not not this
computer that this computer right down
there this is the silent build computer
and it's got windows on it like that
totally full-on legit windows license
windows 8.1 because I updated it and
everything as a fresh installation of
the operating system on there and it's
pretty much good to go all I have to do
is pick the winner and then since this I
want something else to be going on in
this video i also have evolved going on
since i'm live streaming and you know
that's what you do while you live stream
right you and while you will you pick
giveaway winners in live stream at the
same time anyway though to broaden not
to keep you guys in it suspense for too
long but um let me start off with some
statistics Thanks to everyone who
entered this giveaway we had a total of
thirty 6231 entries since there's
multiple ways to enter there were
actually 9791 users or nine thousand
nine 9791 people presumably unless
somebody who's duplicating stuff but you
shouldn't do that that's dishonest so
thanks to all you guys who entered and
then I go right over here and I believe
I can pick a winner what I'm going to do
is pick winner and then I'm gonna play
some evolve and who knows if the winner
is right on top of things and maybe even
watching right now maybe one of you
people live in the chat is going to be
the winner then maybe I can get some
real-time response if not I'm just going
to play some evolve and hope I'm not
very good at it so just
just to give you guys something else to
watch besides yeah at the dry winter
button and hopefully they're there we go
I need to resist the urge to just read
all this stuff off because there's
personal information here but the winner
is first name begins with a okay i'm
trying to think what when we used to do
giveaways when I want to where I worked
before you you give the first initial
and last name and their states their
city and state and that's usually okay
alright so it's a wang wo ng and the
city and state of san francisco
california now i have a gmail address
here that i'm going to email this person
at yeah this this part of the stream is
going to be very boring wow there's more
people now why how are there more people
see if you guys had joined like five
minutes ago i was like talking and being
interesting and stuff like that if you
joined in the past like two or three
minutes it's just me typing an email
over here which probably wasn't very
interesting so I yes I'll give so I've
just emailed the winner if they don't
reply within three minutes I'm going to
wait a bit longer but in the meantime
I'm gonna play some evolve hey what's up
sorry ballistic is joining us as well
thanks for thanks for stepping in hello
ratio 55 cool cool all right Oh sergeant
blue stick just mailed out his gift card
for his first to give away cheers cheers
to that congrats to your winner now
let's see which I set these buttons up
so I can do things yes these things i'm
going to do multiplayer I'm gonna play
some evolved and I'm gonna wait for an
email reply which hopefully will come
soon Oh Strider Strider yeah straighter
let's play can you can I invite you or
you invite me here as ever I'm happy for
anyone who I got into computer so i have
this so he's like that like especially
when people talk to me about the
building computers and the tutorials and
stuff like that like you know because
that's most often what people will come
up and discuss with me as far as
work of mine that they've seen in the
faster that sort of thing um no efforts
oh he's right there sorry guys I'm no
distracted cuz I got a Goliath all of a
sudden usually it's just running around
the map for for quite a while and I've
totally lost my train at that oh yeah
people talk about learning to build
computers yes I have this idea that you
know somebody who saw one of my videos
earlier on and learned how to build a
computer and then they used that
computer you know for something
completely different what is going on
over here actually you know what I
didn't really consider to check is if
all of my rambling right now is also
going out on on on the chat in in evolve
right we need to find this monster we
got birds over here back to my story
though is the idea that somebody learned
to build a computer and then use that
for like something completely different
like you know used it to do something
constructive and and that maybe you know
that person then has solved some world
issue or something like that or at least
save somebody from being trapped my
large can monster beast all right the
winner still has not emailed me i don't
know I don't know what I don't know
what's going on it's disappointed a
little sad full saddened yeah I guess is
a today don't want the you know what
their prize just gonna have to give it
give it to someone in twitch chat it's
just gonna be the only option you guys
oh now he's Stage three good lord is he
up there oh good lord he's right there
yeah
it's terrible oh there he is and I was
just gonna kill us i also have forgotten
which trapper i am cuz i've barely used
this guy oh wow he tossed me there i got
tossed for you bet ya and to reiterate
one more time i'm not very good at
evolve yes thank you for reviving me so
straighter hey hey i hear the monster
what's going on here am i lagging out
that would be awesome to everyone
everyone just stay calm at least i can
still run around though I'm so I'm gonna
get a closer look at the monster since
you never you never get to do this just
check them out close up it's not so bad
it's kind of ugly this is the stage 3
monster of course so you'll notice his
skin has become more right now I never
mind alright so i can at least do
another round of evolved them i see
nothing wrong with that nothing at all
strider can you verify if I was also
like rambling on and on to all the
people in game during the last game as
well yep yes what ok cool it was just
like what the hell the hell is his first
and talking about I thought I heard
footsteps or maybe not o.o way upwards I
thought it was a Goliath but I could
totally be wrong yep he's up
Oh God
Oh God
whoa why did I go the opposite way oh
that's cuz it's cuz the air attack was
coming and I think I could be wrong but
maybe I just wasn't even dead Nick thank
you ah tagged him take so freaking long
to switch to the dome
you should be dead tame it s lon so
close oh that's not it does a beast in
front of it yeah yeah he was like no
hell no I went the wrong way I don't
even think he had a full bar Thursday's
oh yeah very nice game guys uh and and
that is gonna write wait no I'm gonna
give it one last shot one last shot here
nope nothing from a wall right okay I
think I need to give seven days or
something like that for the winter so
I'm chances are this is going to be the
winner and the giveaway will happen and
