to Pauls hardware another dining room
table edition today I'm going to be
taking a look at this SSD but first I
have a question for you guys because
I've done some SSD videos in the past
and they tend to get I don't know pretty
standard I'm going to show some
benchmarks on here I'm going to compare
it to some other SSDs in its range but
for you guys at home if you want leave
me in comments what types of videos
you'd like to see with SSDs apart from
just raw benchmark numbers we've seen
the take and SSD and installed in a
system or a laptop that has a mechanical
drive and see how much faster it is
that's cool but it's been done many
times before so if you've got any ideas
for me please feel free to leave them
but that said let's take a look this is
the plextor m5 pro xstream it's
available 128 256 and 512 gig versions
I've got the 256 here and I'm going to
just do a quick unboxing and then show
you guys some benchmarks first off so
millimeter heights so you can install it
in slimmer notebooks and possibly even
ultrabooks depending on the
configuration of your ultra ultra books
totally hundred thousand I ops reaching
breakthrough in speed which means if you
look at input/output operations per
second which is a popular SSD
benchmarking number to use you should
hit a hundred thousand with this we'll
see if that's true true speed true
protects etc say 26 gigabits per second
2.5 inch you get a 3.5 inch bracket
there's look at the back you do get some
software along with this that's inside
there you can download to help clone or
copy if you're going from an existing
drive high-performance synchronous mlc
nand flash it's actually toshiba 90
nanometer two bits per cell NAND flash
using 16 kilobyte page sizes there's
also some DRAM cash for for for caching
that's good to have here's a closer look
at the performance numbers according to
plextor that you should be able to
achieve with this drive so as you can
see different numbers depending on what
version that you're currently testing I
should be able to hit five hundred forty
megabytes per second on the read 460
megabytes per second on the right
see if those numbers stand up it's more
information there if you guys want to
take a look MTBF wait operational
temperature and whatnot alright so the
first thing that we are faced with is
this which I have already put some tape
over this is the NT is SD solution suite
go to NCI corpcom in that URL use these
codes you can get an NT I echo and NCI
backup now so that's cool added software
I'm not going to be demoing the software
for today's video I want to focus on the
fsd you do get a plextor 3.5 inch drive
bay adapter which is always nice to have
if you're dropping this into an older
system that doesn't have two and a half
inch drive mounts screws for the drive
bay adapter that's handy here's the
drive itself inside the electromagnetic
shielded packaging plastic thing we've
got the drive so I'm aesthetically
pretty simple kind of a nice silver
brushed metal which if you happen to be
placing your SSD in a position in your
case where it's visible which I
recommend doing since these are kind of
premium items it should blended pretty
nice there's a look at front and back
again plextor info and an FCC stuff and
that sort of thing they're pretty
standard and then of course your CL et
data and power connectors as you might
expect I'm actually going to take this
Drive apart really quick let's see if I
can do it while I keep talking there
this is going to void my warranty so as
always don't do this if you purchase the
drive yourself I am returning this to
plextor once this video is done so they
will have a voided warranty I don't
maybe they can put any stick around it
or something the stickers right there
i'm just going to peel it off and with
the last screw removed we should be able
to get into the drives housing i always
like to do this with SSDs just because
it's it's fun i guess i like looking at
the internals of things i like seeing
how things are connected how one piece
is wired to the next piece and what not
and if you're amin in particular if
you're showing an SSD to somebody who's
that has no idea what the heck in s
even is I find it to be helpful okay
because basically what you got is like
if you if you compare this to a
mechanical drive mechanical drives
you'll be able to see a PCB on there and
that has a controller and that's then it
connects up to the mechanical elements
of a mechanical drive but basically with
the with SSD you got the same thing it's
just they extends the PCB and then that
allows them to put the nand flash on
there and then that takes the place of
the spinning elements of a mechanical
drive which is pretty cool but let me
explain what we're looking at right here
first off the controller which is this
kind of big square chip right there
again that's a marvel around enough I
already said it yet but that's a Marvel
88 ss9 187 code name is Monet it's an
eight channel controller so if you think
about that like you might figure a raid
configuration this can sing that can
communicate with eight of these nan
chips at a time and of course it
switches back and forth between all of
them very quickly the other thing is
that this is not a sandforce controlled
drive san force drives have been very
popular they still are to me sandforce
drives have kind of fallen out of all an
out of love with them to some extent
because in order to hit the peak
performance of a sand forest drive you
really need to be using compressible
data and not all data is compressible so
I'm I've taken a liking to some of the
newer drives like these that aren't
using sand force or at least i'm waiting
for lsi sandforce to release a new
controller but again this is a this is a
marvel one it does have custom firmware
and designed by plextor to handle the
management of all of NAND flash storage
it's on there NAND flash storage itself
is you might be able to see from the
toshiba logo toshiba nant 90 nanometer
two bits per cell that's mlc nand again
16 kilobyte package sizes and then right
up here you got some DRAM so it's
another difference from sandforce
controller sandforce controllers will
use part of the nand's for caching
whereas this Marvel controller actually
has discrete DRAM chips and you get a
total of 512 megabytes of that so it's
going to write their store hot data
temporarily to this or if it's doing
trim commands or that sort of thing for
garbage collection it will it will
utilize that and i find it makes a
pretty good solution
you do have 16 of those nand packages as
you can see it on the front eight on the
back and that's a quick look at the
drive itself next up we're going to take
a look at some benchmarks and we're
going to be comparing this to a few
drives that I happen to like right now
the 840 Evo from Samsung the neutron GTX
from corsair and the ocz vector all in
the 242 256 gigabyte range so we're
starting off here with a look at a SSD
and sorry this is a bit clutter but up
on the top we have the overall score as
well as read and write score the Plex
store is the blue and it's hanging them
right in there with all the other drives
lower left is accessed time it's
thousands or hundreds of a millisecond
so everything's pretty much equal there
and then on the lower right you have I
ops and in that test the plextor was
second only to the ocz vector in this
particular test but very good scores
overall next up we have a tow a very
popular test I just took the peak read
and peak right across all the tests in
this one the plextor scored very nicely
again 547 on the read &amp;amp; 4 55 on the
right finally crystal disk mark and
again here the flexor is in the blue so
522 for sequential read about 450 for
sequential right and then there on the
4k queue depth 30 to read I ops it's
hitting the projected hundred thousand
or just just shy of at ninety-nine
thousand 75 in this particular one but
it won that one over all the others and
then again very good score of 85
thousand for 4k queued up 32 right so in
closing the plextor m5 pro xstream is a
very fast SSD like many of the current
gen high-end SSDs it's really bumping up
against the serial ata six gigabits per
second bandwidth limitation so that's
what I've been finding so a lot of the
high-end SSDs will perform within just a
few points of each other the one thing I
will say about this drive right now I've
compared its pricing wise to the other
drives that I showed you guys in the
comparison those are selling for about
one hundred and ninety-two
$200 right now this one I was only able
to find for about two hundred and thirty
bucks so that would be my one complaint
about this in review is that I think the
price does need to come down a little
bit to be competitive with those other
drives but that is something that can be
changed either by retailers over I
plextor so hopefully that will happen as
well to make this one a little bit more
competitive apart from that very happy
at the performance throughput numbers
overall it was able to hit well not a
hundred thousand I ops as it says on the
box but 99,000 so you know what can you
do and I'm sure with a little bit of
finagling you could probably easily get
it over a hundred thousand you might
just need to tweak a few of the settings
and that sort of thing depending on your
benchmark but that's all for this video
very good drive just a little bit a
little bit high in the price thank you
very much for watching you guys again if
you have any suggestions for interesting
things that you might consider to show
doing with an SSD for future videos I'd
be really happy to hear those go ahead
and leave me a comment in the comment
section down below or maybe just to like
or dislike depending on how you thought
about this video and we'll see you all
in the next pulse hardware video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
