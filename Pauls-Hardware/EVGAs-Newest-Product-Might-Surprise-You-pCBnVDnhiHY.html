you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master my next stop at CES was
EVGA and they were having a little bit
of a party when I stopped by so I'm
recording this after the fact but they
had two products I wanted to share with
you guys the first is the RT X 28 TPI
kingpin Edition which is going to be
EVGA z' best nicest fastest most
overbuilt graphics card at least in the
28 ETI range this card has a laundry
list of specs I'm gonna run down them
for you it features a 19 phase VR M it
has 3/8 pin PCI Express power connectors
and it features hybrid cooling so
there's an all-in-one liquid cooler that
has 120 millimeter radiator that
directly cools the GPU and then there's
a 100 millimeter fan you can see that's
directly blowing air over the copper
heat sinks and those cover the memory
and the V RMS there's also an LCD
display on the side of the card that
will show you GPU stats while it is
running including voltage readings
temperatures core clocks GPU utilization
and so on it's got a custom 12 layer PCB
a 3-way v bios switch so you've got 3v
bios is to choose from which is very
handy for overclocking and one of those
V bios's actually has a 520 watt max TDP
settings so that would allow you to
potentially lift in videos power limits
for the 2080 TI which could lead to some
extreme overclocking which is what the
kingpin card is always made for extreme
overclocking thanks Vince speaking of
voltage you have easily accessible
voltage Reed points via the probit
voltage measurement points you've also
got a little evbot plug as well as a
four pin PWM fan header so you can
connect up additional fans to this that
will run based on the GPU temperature
also note that the video outs on the
card used some mini DisplayPort ports
which are smaller so you can have all of
the video outs on a single row they made
it like that so you could remove the
cooler which is a 2 slot cooler and add
a single slots full cover block which
should be coming out at some point once
this card actually launches that would
give you a single slot solution of
course you'll also probably be removing
the cooler on this card if you're going
for super high-end overclocking with
Ellen 2 pots and everything but I think
in that case the single slot thing is
less of a concern I happen to think this
card looks pretty beastly especially
when you look at the whole package with
the almond liquid cooler and everything
unfortunately though we still have no
word on frequencies as well as release
dates or price it's probably going to be
expensive
next up a product that we've probably
all expected from EVGA a sound card
actually no if
has never made a sound card before and
technically they are not calling this a
sound card it is an audio card because
audio is better than sound so in case
you missed it last year at Computex
gamers Nexus went to EVGA CEO Andrew
hands house and he is an audiophile he
has an entire room dedicated to audio
equipment of all ranges but all very
very high-end so that was kind of the
inspiration for this audio card and it
is called new audio it was designed in
collaboration with audio note it
features a six layer gold-plated PCB
audio note capacitors and resistors and
a Texas Instruments powered regulation
circuit you also get german-made we
makup acid errs AKM four four nine three
decks for digital to analog conversion
and AKM five five seven to ADCs for
analog to digital EVGA i wanted to focus
on clean pure audio for this card so
they used an x mas x core 200 processor
with an emphasis on true audio
reproduction rather than modifying the
source track with post-production this
card is powered by a single SATA
connector it can drive up to 600 ohm
headphones and it supports up to 384
kilohertz 32-bit audio files the ports
on the back includes stereo RCA a
quarter inch and two 3.5 milimeter jacks
as well as a Toslink port there is also
an HD audio front panel header on the
card as well but I would highly
recommend against not using that because
you really want to be plugging directly
into the cards jacks itself when you buy
a high-end sound card like this it is
not a good idea to run your analog audio
through the Faerie electrically noisy
computer and up to your front panel a
mic and headphone jacks on the computer
which are often very poor quality
so Andrew actually took me aside during
the little EVGA party and he forced me
to listen to some of his very high
quality high bitrate audio tracks I
can't play these back for you because of
licensing and you wouldn't be hearing
them the same way I was anyway but
hopefully by my reaction you can see
perhaps that I was engaged in a
rapturous auditory experience with clear
separation between individual
instruments as well as vocals crisp eyes
and voluminous but not overpowering bass
now to be fair this experience was
probably enhanced by the cans I was
wearing which are audio technica ath w
1000 x grandioso headphones at retail
for about $600
but as any audiophile will tell you if
you want that kind of experience
everything from the sound source to the
headphones that push the sound into your
ears needs to be really high quality so
in all honesty I would
expect this to be a product that
suddenly reignites the sound card
industry but it is a new option for
those who do like really high quality
sound I think another reason is that
most people just don't get the
opportunity to actually listen to a
setup like that as most people are just
comfortable wearing normal headphones
which work just fine but you really have
to have kind of an a/b comparison to
sort of appreciate how much more clarity
and depth of the sound you can get
especially if you have like a favourites
audio track or something like that and
you listen to it again on this setup
you're like oh my gosh there sounds
there I've never heard before also there
is the selling price which is going to
be 250 dollars and that is more money
than lots of people spend on their
graphics cards so there's a trade-off if
you're an EVGA elite member you can get
it for $200 but guys that is going to
wrap it up for my coverage of the EVGA
suite here at CES 2019 thank you so much
for watching and of course a big thank
you to my sponsors for this event
