excellent what's up guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware in today's video i'm
going to be doing benchmarking testing
and some evaluation of my march builds I
know it's early April already but I
actually built the system in March so
I'm actually getting caught back up with
my monthly builds if you're not familiar
I plan out a couple builds at the
beginning of every month and then I
build one of those systems and then I
follow up and test it and benchmark it
and give you guys my feedback on the
experience and this has been a pretty
fun build it's my first ever actual full
ridin system based on the AMD risin 7
1,700 CPU I also have a gtx 1070 in
there from Galax I also have some
Coolermaster components in the v6 50
power supply as well as the mastercase
pro 6 which is a brand new case from
coolermaster as well as their new master
air pro for the cooler that's in there
which is also doing a pretty good job
and looking pretty nice while we're at
it I've actually already overclocked
this CPU so I basically went to dial in
the same overclock that I got when I did
my rise in overclocking video and if you
guys are interested in that because I
kind of walk through the overclocking
process a link to that is also up in the
corner do some instability issues I
actually dialed overclock back just a
tad 3.8 Giga Hertz was what I had across
all of the cores still plenty fast and
then with that silent I went on to the
GPU and basically dialed the same GPU
overclock I had when I tested best
graphics card back in December plus 126
megahertz on the GPU plus 202 on the
memory and then maxing the power and
temperature targets the fans I set to
60% which gave a nice balance between a
little bit more noise with plenty more
cooling performance that gave me a base
clock of 1721 a boost of 1911 it didn't
get up past 20 100 megahertz max but of
course that leveled up after
temperatures started to rise I was
getting about 20 20 megahertz average on
the GPU core clock and the temperatures
were again very nice 50 degrees was what
it was at at idle and that's with the
fans
spinning up at also zero noise
generation and then 84c was when it hit
max load while benchmarking but that was
kind of more rare when I was actually
run into gaming benchmarks and doing a
much more reasonable load on it like you
do at home while you're just playing a
video game it was just getting up into
the mid 70s which is perfectly fine for
an overclocked gtx 1070 next let's move
into some sound testing and i will say
that this system is very very quiet
especially with fans set to silent mode
of course and even with the fans at
silent mode the cooling was pretty
adequate i will mention that i did need
to use a fan splitter to connect those
two front fans up to the motherboard not
because of a lack of motherboard headers
but simply because the cables on the
included 120 millimeter fans at the
front of the case weren't quite long
enough to reach all the headers on the
motherboard so just simpler to connect
those both up to a single header towards
the front of the board some fanta
connections might be helpful for this
case in the future Coolermaster if
you're watching and then beyond that i
wanted to do some temperature testing
with these panels because they pop up up
and down and they give you a little bit
more airflow when they're up but they
will let a little bit more noise come
out i didn't know there's a huge
difference in temperature with the
panel's open it might have been a degree
or two cooler however the temperature is
kind of fluctuating here in my garage i
don't want to say that's a scientific
test what I will do though is give you
guys a sound test with those panels open
versus closed
so there you go guys not a huge
difference in noise generation what the
panel's open versus closed but nice to
have that option I suppose what I would
probably do running the system full-time
is leave them closed most of the time
and then if I was doing something that
was really heavy lifting like say I was
queueing up a video to render out or
something would pop those open a little
bit more air get get in without having
to worry about the noise generation
let's move into some gaming benchmarks
though with the gtx 1070 this is
obviously a gaming system ran all these
tests at 2560 by 1440 which I find to be
a nice mid-range resolution for a gtx
1070 and here you go
benchmarks
so obviously this system can handle the
games no problem I'm not doing a direct
side-by-side comparison to an Intel
system but I will be doing a little bit
more of that coming up and very soon
because although this system has a right
in seven CPU Hey look rise in size that
should be available very soon so hey my
monthly billed for April which is going
to be happening happening also very soon
probably you can expect to have some
rise and 5 influence going on there
but since this is not just a gaming PC
it's also made for other things let's do
some video encoding tests
so now that you guys have had a taste of
the performance with this system let's
wrap up with some closing thoughts first
off the motherboard the asrock X 370
Taichi I think did a fantastic job here
I like the look of it it's a little bit
more distinct with the black and white
aesthetic but all got the job done and
even though it's sort of more towards
the higher end when it comes to as rocks
products tech it's still very very
reasonably priced especially when you
compare it to like say that use
crosshair 6 now the SSD if you guys
didn't already notice I actually swapped
out I dropped it so Shiba and they're
just just full disclosure that was just
because I actually needed my sand disc
because it's an external drive that I
usually use with a bunch of games I
don't want copy everything but there
that is it shouldn't affect the
benchmarks or performance in the
slightest let's talk about RGB LEDs
while we're at this the case is a little
bit limited in that respect I was
actually pretty surprised when I first
booted this system up so that this has a
blue LED fan for the exhaust here from
Coolermaster it's just it definitely
makes this a blue accented case along
with the blue accent mine across the
front there which I suppose matches as
long as you want blue to be part of your
aesthetic coup and master is also
producing this case with red LEDs so red
accent to the front and red LED fan all
although I can't would have preferred if
it was just a standard black fan here
for the exhaust and let you do whatever
the heck you want inside also that's LED
at the front again it looks nice but
without it being RGB it's hard to have
it match with the rest of the system if
you are going for RGB all that said if
your kid with blue and you want
everything in the match like I have
found I ended up with kind of a red
white and blue color scheme here it's
red on the bottom because of the
motherboard LED and the LEDs on the
bottom of the galaxy 1070 blue up top as
well as on the front and then of course
the white accents on the mother
motherboard which doesn't look too bad
but it doesn't give you the flexibility
that you'd have with like the full size
our GB system like I have going on back
there all that said RGB is an aesthetic
thing and the final thing that I really
wish you could do that you can't at
least as far as I could tell on the
motherboard or on the graphics card is
turn them all off you got to have some
lights going on in there so all that
said aesthetically this wasn't my
favorite when it comes to the lighting
but I thought the case overall looks
pretty nice
it is fairly large but was able to fit
everything in there really easily and
there's tons of extra space actually was
actually look at this system like this
is like they like version one of this
system where you get everything in there
and up and running there's so much extra
stuff and extra space in here to add
more stuff like evil you could drop
another graphics card in there easily
additional expansion slots could be used
for adding more storage or a raid card
or capture card or anything like that
you got of course tons more space for
SSDs I removed an entire Drive cage you
have tons of room for more Drive gauges
five and a quarter inch Bay's at the
front you can of course add more memory
here it's only got 16 gigs we get two
additional slots so tons and tons of
upgrade potential with this system which
I always like to have all I found this
to be an incredibly powerful system and
I'm really happy that with the AMD Rison
platform you can get a build like this
with eight cores 16 threads tons of room
for expansion
it's an AMD system but it's still modern
and it's got all of the bells and
whistles that you would expect with a
modern build and it's coming in it way
way way less than it would cost to get
an Intel 8 core platform with similar
performance gaming of course is a
question we can continue to discuss when
it comes to Rison versus Intel's CPUs
but more on that of course in upcoming
videos in particular I'm going to be
attacking that one more time because
I've got rise in five concepts that's in
the very near future so stay tuned for
that
although guys I think you guys would be
happy with this build also of course
check out the two parts list I have in
the description because if you kitted
out like I have here it's going to cost
around $1400 but if you're willing to
swap out a few parts here and there you
can get basically equivalent performance
for around 1200 dollars and for 1200 I
think a system like this is absolutely
beastly especially if you're doing
anything like content creation or if
you're doing gaming and streaming at the
same time or if you're doing higher-end
stuff anything that's really really
intensive on the CPU and needs multiple
threads now you guys so much for
watching this video though I hope you
have enjoyed it hit the thumbs up button
if you did leave your comments in the
comment section below give me some
suggestions for April builds because I'm
going to be working on those very soon
and as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
