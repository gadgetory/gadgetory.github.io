Pauls hardware this is my second garage
work log video and I'm very excited
because I've got a Saturday right now to
do some work and some building my main
issue that I'm dealing with right now is
that I've got a desk over there it's an
old desk but it works but I kind of want
to separate my like tools my building
stuff like that like construction and I
mean I don't have that much of it but
I'm going to get more over time so I
wanna I want a workbench so as you can
see I have a bunch of wood here behind
me yeah that's fun and I'm going to
build the wood into a workbench and I'm
going to use my camera's little
time-lapse feature one more time to give
you guys a look at what I'm doing
today so hopefully you enjoy and since
everyone seems so happy with it last
time I'm going to be doing some
benchmarks in the background as well
that's a way across fire r9 290x
configuration and I've got three 2560 by
1600 monitors this is that's four Newegg
TV so keep an eye out for that one once
it's done hopefully sometime next week
and for the rest of the day here's
here's me building the workbench enjoy
you
you
and there you have it guys the finished
project at least for now this is this is
Sunday if you guys couldn't tell it got
dark and then and then morning came in
the video this has been quite a bit of
work I've been putting it on this one
but I'm pretty happy with the result
especially considering the materials and
tools that I'm currently working with
which you're fairly limited but as you
can see I got a bottom shelf down there
I got a top shelf so I don't know if you
want to call this a workbench or a
project table or a work table or a
project bench I'm gonna call it a
crafting table because that's what I've
been feeling like the whole time I've
been working on this this table is going
to be used to make many many other
things so it's pretty rough right now
it's not really finished I did a little
bit of sanding on the top I haven't
really done much otherwise if you guys
are wondering I have been working off of
some plans those came from the Family
Handyman website so that's kind of part
of it it's it's actually a larger
project and I did change up the
dimensions a little bit but I didn't do
the Shelf up above I'm not sure if I'm
gonna end up doing that or not I did go
through all of my screws my-my-my 3-inch
prime guard turned it what about cookies
they're my 3 inch the 3 inch screws yeah
anyway they're exterior screws but I
paid a little bit more for that that's
trying to use my safety goggles as much
as possible and I was doing some what
should be precision cuts here with
basically a handsaw which we're not a
hands but like a circular saw which is
not ideal I'm hopefully going to get
like a miter saw or something in the
future but it's all come together again
that's pretty much going to be all for
this video you might also have noticed
that I kind of gave up on the
benchmarking fairly early on I realized
it was going to be hard to keep both of
these going at the same time and then I
also realized the amount of sawdust in
here was not conducive to a computer
running especially not that computer
over there so hey I turned that off
don't where I mean I'm going to blow out
some candy or and get that all cleaned
but thanks for watching my my garage
work log this has been my project for
the weekend don't forget to subscribe I
guess give me some feedback if you liked
the video hit the like button and we'll
see you next time when I make another
video I'm going to go use some canned
air on my camera actually that's that's
what I should be doing now</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
