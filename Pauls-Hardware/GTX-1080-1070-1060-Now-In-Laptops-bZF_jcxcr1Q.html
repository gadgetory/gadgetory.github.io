video I'm in London invited here by
Nvidia and why am i why do they have
Iceland but here's Buckingham Palace a
sign of such regal kings queens
pageantry what is known that if any had
snow announcements for us and we're
going to share this right now what
they're doing is taking their graphics
cards that they just loves 1062 1070
1080 and they're just shoving them into
laptops
okay guys I've switched a voice-over
mode for better audio now and your first
question is probably is this the launch
of the GTX 10 ATM 1070 m 1060 m the
answer would be no these are
full-fledged GPUs just like they kind of
did on a limited basis with the GTX 980
in laptops so they're not cut down
mobile versions and videos doing this
because they are expecting about 30
percent sales growth in 2016 for GTX
class Mobile GPU based notebooks as lazy
people who don't want to build their own
computers look for gaming pcs that can
handle current gen titles and VR also
they're leveraging the efficiency of
Pascal and I guess laptops being
portable is also kind of convenient
Nvidia says these ten series GPU laptops
will be available globally tomorrow
Tuesday August 16th just in time for
back-to-school assuming they can keep
them in stock of course which has been a
big problem for their desktop variants
but that remains to be seen
let's get into specifics though first
there's the GTX 1080 this one still has
2560 cuda cores a 17 33 megahertz boost
clock eight gigs of 10 gigabit per
second gddr5 X memory and this will
replace the GTX 980 and a laptop so nice
upgrade there the gtx 1070 will have
2048 cuda cores 1645 megahertz boosts
clock eight gigabytes of eight gigabit
per second gddr5 and it will replace the
980 m note here it's some slight spec
variants this one actually has more cuda
cores than the desktop gtx 1070 which
has 1920 cuda cores but it runs at a
slightly lower frequency and vidya says
that this offset on both accounts
provides pretty much equivalent
performance finally the gtx 1060 will
have 1280 cuda cores
1670 megahertz boost clock 6 gigabytes
of eight gigabit per second gddr5 and
will replace the 970 m
again a slight variance here from the
desktop specs just about a thirty
megahertz lower boost clock if you're
like me your next question would be can
these overclock and the answer would be
yes comparing them to the Maxwell mobile
GPUs which could overclock to maybe 80
to 120 megahertz over their reference
specs pascal's should expect to see 200
to 300 megahertz an additional
overclocking Headroom the reason is they
have dual FET power supplies now which
drives a lot of power in a small area as
well as a multi-phased power controller
which increases power efficiency and
reduces noise these are updates to the
power delivery system with Pascal that
we saw on the desktop side now when it
comes to overclocking your mileage may
vary of course based on the laptop you
by its design and its cooling also bear
in mind there's no voltage control with
the desktop 10 series GPUs that is kind
of to be expected since there's thermal
limitations with the size of laptops and
the target temperature is still 83
degrees Celsius Nvidia did a live
overclocking demo for us it did have a
couple hiccups but they managed to get
it working they were using a GTX 1080
equipped MSI laptop and they started out
with the base clock of 1607 applied at
225 megahertz offset in MSI Afterburner
that resulted in the GPU running at
about 2,000 63 while gaming at the
temperature was 72 degrees Celsius and
they played doom in 1920 by 1080 with
ultra settings OpenGL mode and it
resulted in a frame rate of about 120 to
140
now since laptops have displays
integrated there are some display
upgrades in the work as well 120 Hertz
g-sync notebook displays at 2560 by 1440
and that's a pretty drool-worthy spec
for any gaming laptop out there although
I imagine these are going to be pretty
high-end and maybe pretty pricey
either way you do have decent support of
course and when it's integrated into the
laptop screen you actually don't need
that g-sync chip so that's pretty nice -
now we already know that Pascal is very
efficient and NVIDIA claims up to 30%
more battery life on Pascal based GPUs
compared to Maxwell that is a really
impressive spec especially if you like
to game well unplugged there will be a
new battery boost feature integrated
into the Nvidia control panel that will
allow you to set a max framerate or
choose between frame rate quality
settings or battery life so lowering the
settings or the resolution will
translate into the GPU using less juice
and giving you more battery we should be
seeing this soon
with a driver updates and this will
apply not just to these Pascal based
GPUs but to all mobile GTX platforms so
that's pretty nice as far as the laptops
themselves Nvidia had a ton of them on
display they say they're going to be
able to get them down as thin as 18
millimeters potentially as light as 4
pounds and they're going to be available
from every conceivable major laptop
manufacturer that's out there so
gigabyte Lenovo EVGA Asus MSI HP razor
pretty much all of them and of course
all these laptops are going to be VR
ready as long as they have the proper
USB and HDMI connections for the
head-mounted displays one caveat is that
they will need to stay plugged in but
that's still pretty nice to be able to
do VR on a laptop so if your question
now is are these laptops going to be
better than my gaming desktop and the
answer would be maybe if you are using
an older GPU but if you compare the same
GPU from this generation the desktop
variant will still perform better and
stay cooler and have better overclocking
potential especially with that voltage
control at reference frequencies you
should expect performance that's within
about 10% of the desktop variants when
you're using one of these in a laptop
finally I want to point out that we
definitely need some more independent
testing and reviews of these laptops
some of those reviews should be
available now so check the interwebs for
those more should be coming soon but all
the information provided today was
directly from Nvidia and as we all know
with marketing material they tend to
paint a pretty glowing picture of
themselves all that said though I'm
pretty excited about these full-fledged
GPUs coming to laptops hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video guys
and we'll see you next time for all of
the optical disks that we use all of
them fall in the optimum iMagic gonna
need you're a soos drivers - yes oh yeah
yeah I got a load your drivers off the
driver disk unless you threw it away
yeah but you wouldn't have thrown that
away because
you've been watching Linus you know know
Linus tells you to throw him away all
this right yep he's the problem
you know much more lives geez</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
