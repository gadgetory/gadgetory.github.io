Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool
welcome to my next CES 2018 video guys I
have made my way over to ZOTAC there in
this big roundish Suites here at
Caesar's Palace so it's actually a
really cool room I've heard they're
gonna have a party here tomorrow anyway
they have some new mini pcs they're
really good at those so I've got some
external enclosures they have a very
mysterious very mysterious project down
there that they've told me very limited
things about but I'll share it with you
nonetheless and they have a couple
really cool custom-built pcs I wanted to
share with you as well so many pcs all
right this is the zotac VR go showed you
guys this over at Computex it's a VR
backpack so computer you wear on your
backs for VR they've updated this by
making the zotac logo light up which
everyone was asking for and they've also
got a slightly updated version
this one's got a gtx 1070 in it and the
one upstairs actually has a gtx 1080 in
it so you can you can put a computer on
your back so these many pcs up here are
actually workstations and this is kind
of a new thing so techs doing for anyone
who's interested in workstation if
you're doing video editing or anything
that requires a lot of heavy lifting I
got five thousand one thousand and the
three thousand here they're working on
these designs they're still in
development but from what boo told me
they're mostly aiming to make it look
kind of like this one right here which
has a nice finish some ventilation along
the sides coarse ports up front party in
the back and they are they're gonna
feature Quadro full-size NVIDIA Quadro
cards Quadro p3000 P 1000 and P 5000
which goes along with the name now of
course we've got the Magnus series
they've been working on this for a while
there's some other variants of that with
different components in them and
higher-end for gaming and that kind of
thing I wanted to show you guys this one
really quick this is the CI 616 nano
which is fairly small and it's actually
an external box design that they are
sort of developing and they wanted to
get a little bit of feedback on so there
it is it's got a white sort of front
going around the front of the front
right there it's got a couple USB 3.1
gen2 ports which I thought was pretty
cool to have on the front of us
like this tons of ventilation all around
and it is a plastic frame but does seem
fairly sturdy and then I'll you get all
your IO at the back with another white
accent panel so guys let us know in the
comments down below what you think of
this little mini PC design if you guys
are looking for something that you can
maybe drop into your living room for an
HTPC or something like that let us know
if you'd be interested again that's a CI
669 on this one Hertz in particular
features in I 78550 you processor ddr4 a
2.5 inch hard drive bay and again two of
those USB 3.1 ports alright and real
quickly I wanted to show you these
really tiny ones down at the end this
one has been out there's this previous
smallest a mini PC that so tech made
which is the peak OPI 336 this has an
Intel and 4100 quad core in its those 4
gigs of memory and a 32 gigabytes of
storage but look at this one here this
is the Pico pi2 26
it has a new Gemini Lake based processor
from Intel so it is a Celeron processor
dual core at one point one gigahertz the
Intel and 4,000 4 gigs of memory 32
gigabytes of emmc onboard storage and a
couple USB 3.0 ports which are right
over on that side so you would use those
to connect up external signage for
example or monitors over on this side
it's got a micro USB micro port that's
used for power and then I believe there
is a micro SD card slot those there so
you can add some expanded storage now
you're probably not going to be able to
do much gaming on this or anything like
that because it is very small so you
know it's not exactly half crazy
graphics prowess but what they have set
up to do back here is for digital
signage so that larger one that they
have set up just connecting up a couple
of these displays and then this display
on the top right is running just off one
of these little devices so if you have a
sign in a restaurant something like that
needs something low-power
passively cooled and very very small and
portable check out the Pico pi2 26
finally we have this little VR setup the
zotac is put together just with an
oculus rift and they're basically trying
to show off the newest version of the
Magnus with an Intel 8th gen core
processor this actually has an 8700 in
it which means it's got 6 cores and 12
threads
also got a GTX 1080 mini in there with 8
gigs of video memory it's also got 2
ddr4 sticks going up to 20 666 speed and
obtain memory slot as well so if you
want to accelerate a old mechanical hard
drive or something like that that's a
great solution to use obtained for I'm
not a huge fan of obtain myself but it
is it is available so I thought I'd
pointed out there's a quick rundown of
the rest of the specs this is not
available yet they are still finalizing
this design but it does support up to
four individual displays and again does
support VR so we're looking for a launch
of the Magnus with 8th gen Intel Core
processor in q2 of 2018 however here's
the zotac gaming area and so Tech's
actually working on some some
peripherals like these are these little
Bluetooth controllers that they're
working on this is these miss concept
products they are not sure whether or
not they're actually going to bring them
to market but if there's interests you
can so little controller connected up to
bluetooth beyond Android to an Android
device via bluetooth and get your game
on now over here on the left is actually
a product that launched in December this
is the MEK 1 gaming system so a
full-size desktop chassis although it is
a very slim a very slim in spelt sort of
design that they have going on there
like it kind of pinches in in the middle
like that's its waist right there but it
does have plenty of ventilation they've
got some slots going on on the side to
allow airflow and that kind of thing and
these are actually going to be selling
as full systems the one on the left over
here which launched in December has a
7700 to the seventh gen intel core
processor and a gtx 1070 now this one
over on the right is coming soon and
this one's going to have an 8 again
until copy lake processor as well as a
gtx 1080 now they are going to ship with
a Windows license and it's also going to
ship with these peripherals so you're
gonna get an optical gaming mouse and
you're also going to get this keyboard
which has blue switches they are generic
blue switches they won't tell me what
brands specifically they are but they
are mechanical and it has a very quick e
mechanical feel now this is going to
work with the spectra software so you
can use that in order to control the
lighting that's going around the accent
edges
like one gaming chassis itself and then
it's gonna ship with of course the
processor and graphics card we already
mentioned Souls the 240 gig nvme SSD
over here we have external box so for
example down here is a small ZOTAC
external dock this one's got a hundred
eighty watt power supply in it so so I
get a sports graphics cards in the range
of like a gtx 1060 but it is connected
via Thunderbolt 3 so you just need a
laptop or a small PC they've got one of
their nano pcs right here normally this
PC would not be capable of gaming but
hook it up to an external graphics card
via lightning I'm sorry be its
Thunderbolt 3 and there you go suddenly
you have a gaming system here's another
one this one's just called external
Thunderbolt 3 box because it's still in
development but this one's basically
made to support full-size up to 12 inch
graphics cards it also includes a 550
watt power supply so that's enough juice
not only to power the graphics card
itself but if you have a Thunderbolt 3
connection to your laptop for example
you can actually when you connect your
laptop to this external GPU dock charge
your laptop at the same time it's got
that single Thunderbolt 3 port and a
couple USB 3.0 ports as well as that by
16 PCIe slots for your graphics card and
finally we have the amp box and this
one's probably going to be the most
interesting to any of you guys out there
watching my channel because this one
does have enough juice 450 watts to
support a high end graphics card so
anything up to a gtx 980ti
it will work with right now as long as
it's not too long they've got a so tach
mini in there right now so bear in mind
you are limited to nine inch graphics
cards but that does include a pretty
wide range it's got a PCIe 16 by 16 slot
in there and it's got RGB lighting
integrated that you can also use and
control with that spectra software that
I showed you just a moment ago and this
one can also provide an additional
hundred watts of power at 20 volts out
so you can use this one to charge an
external laptop as well now up here we
have kind of a unique product something
that I'm not really sure if I've seen
before and ZOTAC is not giving very many
details on this one because they're
working with several hardware partners
on it and they won't tell me who that
they are and this
not even be a ZOTAC product when it
comes out but basically what you have
here is a 38 inch curved ultra wide
display
it's a 38 40 by 1600 so it is 21 by 9
resolution or aspect ratio and fairly
high resolution it can display 4k
although it will be it will be scaled
down just a little bit since you don't
have quite the vertical 4k resolution
but it's an all-in-one computer not just
a display so it's got everything that
you need to run the computer actually
built-in and integrated into the back
it's also got a couple video inputs so
for example they have an Xbox connected
up to it right now
and they just have a split screen going
on with floors going out on one side and
then the integrated computer displaying
on the left side so you get split screen
options and from what I understand the
system it's running on in the back there
has a CPU with the graphics built into
it that's all I can tell you so I got to
leave it mysterious beyond that who
knows if and when this product will come
out but I like all in ones when they are
done well though Tech does a pretty good
job with them and pairing up a high end
CPU plus GPU combination with this kind
of display I think that would be a good
option so keep an out for this product
whenever if and when it does watch and
guys as I've done in the past I'm gonna
finish by showing you guys a couple
custom builds as otech has on display
right here over my right shoulder as a
build by BS mods it's got a gtx 980ti
Arctic storm many in it's a corsair
crystal series 570 x mid tower case EK
water cooling components a 77 40 X
processor fringe I'm cringing at that a
little bit 4 by 8 gigs of memory and an
X $2.99 motherboard and then finally
here over my right shoulder once again
is a build by romli Christensen this one
has a GTX 1080 mini as well it's got a
destiny to theme if that's not evidence
fractals Celsius s24 cooler a 95 6600 K
processor HyperX memory and a cooler
master d750 cooler because it's gonna
wrap it up for my coverage here at the
zotac Suites in Las Vegas Nevada HIPPA
comes up button if you enjoyed this
video and of course a big final thank
