send me a gtx 980ti to review i said no
no gigabyte i said i will not look at
your 980 TI unless it is the best
possible 980 TI that you can make they
said it is so I said okay here's my
review of the gigabyte gtx 980 TI
extreme gaming water force with RGB
lighting i was gonna show you guys 500
cool features of the fractal core 500
ITX case but that would take way too
long so here are five it's compact and
sleek with a brushed front panel it has
surprisingly good water cooling support
it has big magnetic dust filters it
supports full-size ATX power supplies
and it has room for 170 millimeter tall
CPU coolers click the sponsor link in
the description for more information
so the 980 TI has been out for about six
months now and as with most GPUs a bit
of time passing post-launch has provided
us with a ton of 980 TI flavors AIB
partners have concocted all manner of
cooling implementations for Nvidia stop
to your GPU that's not called Titan X at
least and the new hotness is integrating
an all-in-one water cooler to keep the
temperatures down and provide more
Headroom for overclocking this is not a
new trick for anyone who's wondering I
actually first saw this a i/o water
cooling on a graphics card back with the
zotac GTX 580 infinity that was in 2011
and in case anyone's curious I'm gonna
post the link to the video I did on nuoc
TV down in the description if you want
to check it out
also there's a like button down there
which I encourage you to click if you
liked the video just saying so current
gen a io water-cooled GPUs include the
EVGA hybrid as well as the MSI and
Corsair collaboration that has a
different name depending on if they put
it in a corsair box or an msi box
you know 3d also has one as well but I
don't believe it's available in the US
and then over on Team red side there is
the fury X of course anyway though this
980ti is from gigabyte specifically
their extreme gaming line the e and
extremists silent and invisible if you
haven't heard of extreme gaming that's
because it's new gigabyte tells me
extreme gaming is the new name for their
tippity-top to your gaming and
overclocking product line still no word
though and if they'll be reimbursing g1
gaming series product owners for their
second fiddle lessons as such it's meant
to compete not just with the
aforementioned AIO water
gpus from the likes of EVGA and msi but
also with similar cards from competitors
a la the EVGA kingpin MSI lightning the
asus matrix and of course the ATI all in
wonder all of these cards share a
similarity in that they manufacturers
promise that you get a binned GPU for
the price premium that means that
they've tested all of the GPUs in their
stock that they got from Nvidia and they
choose the chips that can overclock to
higher frequencies for these cards
specifically and for many enthusiasts
that alone is worth the price here's a
closer look at the card though and I'm
wondering what you guys think of this
design aesthetically I kind of feel like
it's actually a step back from the g1
gaming series particularly the 980 which
has that all black metal shroud design
and feels kind of like holding a solid
brick of copper in your hand when you
pick it up by comparison the extreme
gaming water force feels much more
lightweight and I was actually a little
bit disappointed with the kind of flimsy
or feeling plastic shroud that they have
on there this time around aesthetics are
actually my biggest complaint about this
card which is good if all you care about
is performance but let me just get this
all out here aside from the flimsy
shroud the RGB LED lighting feature is
there and can be controlled via gigabyte
software the logo and these two strips
down either side of the window light up
and you do have a range of colors to
choose from and some flashing and
breathing options for effects but the
LED colors I found were inconsistent
between the Gigabyte logo on top and the
two accents on the windows and in what
seems to be an ongoing design flaw for
RGB LED implementation in the PC space
there are other lights on the card that
can't change their color or be turned
off yes the two white LEDs that
conveniently tell you if your peg
connectors are in are nice but then
they're white so they don't they blend
in a little bit more better but but wow
do they stand out and there's the
extreme button on the end as well which
puts the card into a special tuning mode
for exotic cooling which can be either
blue if it's off or red if it's turned
on and nothing else I don't know it's
the ability to turn these off in the
future can be added via firmware
software but I really feel that it
detracts from the flexibility of RGB
lighting on any products when you're
forced to color coordinated with other
fixed colors especially when those
colors
other LED lights okay sorry for the rant
there and please do not write this card
off yet because the performance side of
the story is much much more pleasant so
anyway there's a nice backplate on there
it's black and it's metal you got your
standard video out configuration of
three display ports one HDMI and one
dual link DVI you got two eight pin peg
connectors for power and then there's
one more optional six pin peg connector
specifically for driving more power in
the extreme mode when that little button
on the end is pushed I ran all of my
tests overclocked and without that third
power plug connected and I had no
problems at all so it's really not
necessary and it's really only there for
people who are pushing the cards to its
limits are doing exotic cooling there is
a hundred twenty millimeter radiator
attached to the end via these two slim
tubes which actually might be a little
bit on the short side depending on your
case
honestly short tubing is a blessing when
it just barely fits but a curse when
it's just not quite long enough but I'm
bear that in mind and then you got a
hundred twenty millimeter fan on here
which seems to do a great job at while
also staying nice and quiet so thank you
gigabyte for not cheeping out on the fin
the pump inside the shroud is powered
through the card so that's nice too
there's no extra plug that you have to
plug into the motherboard for example
and the fan is also wired up directly to
the card with the cable kind of zip tied
to the tubing here that's kind of keeps
things nice and clean but the fan is
literally hardwired in there so you
can't swap it out without probably
cutting a wire soldering maybe you're
probably avoiding your warranty as well
so that would have been nice to be able
to swap that fan out if we wanted to
taking a look beneath the shroud you'll
find the full coverage copper block with
some heat pipes embedded that cools not
just the GPU but also the power delivery
and the memory as well I really like
this design because it did a great job
keeping everything cool I was testing
and it means that there's no need for an
extra little fan in there for active
cooling over the VRMs the PCB is custom
designed by gigabyte and features a bit
of water resistance in there for exotic
cooling on the PCB 12 + 2 phase power
delivery and hopefully support for GPU
water blocks in the future my makers
like maybe ek because I think custom
water cooling this card would be a
really good choice here's a look at the
980ti extreme gaming water force next to
some
they're comparable cards the gtx 980ti
reference from nvidia of course EVG is
air-cooled superclocked card and the
fury x from AMD which still wins the
tiniest flagship GPU award it's time to
get into some benchmark numbers but
first off here's some quick specs which
you're probably familiar with so I'm not
going to go over them all in detail the
biggest difference here is the GPU and
gddr5 frequencies and to show you what
kind of range you can get with benchmark
results even with the same GPU I have
the Nvidia reference 980ti running at
its default out-of-the-box speeds that
means 7000 megahertz effective memory
speed and GPU boost speeds that will hit
just over 1200 that's up from the base
clock of 1000 and that is the reference
design from nvidia i over clocked the
snot out of this 980 TI extreme gaming
water force meanwhile pushing the memory
although up to 8000 effective push the
GPU to 1525 megahertz
that's peak GPU boost and hit that
consistently and with remarkably little
effort while only reaching a max
temperature of about 60 degrees Celsius
here are the benchmarks
well those are some sexy benchmarks
here's a quick aside though about aao
water cooling in general if you want a
water cooled GPU consider this water
cooling will give you much lower GPU
temperatures and it can keep the memory
and vrm temps down to noise can also be
reduced since 820 millimeter fan can
cool more effectively while spinning at
a lower rpm thanks to its size and the
efficiency of using a water-cooled
radiator to dissipate the heat the
flipside is that you're introducing more
points of failure into your system and
while this AIO unit has been cool quiet
and has had no problems for me so far I
have experienced excessive pump noise
over time and some AIO units I've worked
with or even worse pump failure or even
worse a leak depending on the product in
question these incidences should be rare
but it is something I think prospective
buyers should take into account anyway
though here is my conclusion if it
wasn't evidence in the benchmarks based
on pure performance this is the fastest
980ti that I have laid hands on it does
a great job of keeping temps down making
very little noise even without being
installing a case and there's just tons
of potential here for aftermarket water
cooling exotic cooling of course and
extra performance via overclocking even
with just its out-of-the-box state I did
have my aesthetic quibbles with the
lighting and the cheap feel of the
shroud but ultimately this GPU is
actually kind of cost-effective if
you're looking at other 980ti in the
market the MSRP is 720 dollars and
that's less than the MSI lightning which
is 790 although checking just now before
making the video that's available for
700 with an sale and a mail-in rebate
anyway the EVGA kingpin is 850 all the
way up to a thousand 50 depending on if
you want their most bestest overclocking
or not they've been their gpus and then
they charged it consecutively higher for
depending on how much you want it to
overclock good if you want a guaranteed
overclocking GPU not so good if you like
not paying over $1000 490 I now other a
IO cooled 980 T is are out there but
they don't all necessarily promise the
best of the best class performance that
the extreme gaming line from gigabyte
does with next-gen HBM to cards most
likely still good six months or more
away from launch this I think is a very
compelling offering for performance
enthusiasts who want water cooling out
of the box
who wants huge overclocking Headroom and
and want to cool and quiet experience
overall even if the aesthetics aren't
quite all there that is all for this
