excellent what's up guys welcome to my
weekend vlog I have lots to do today
you might hear some dogs going crazy
behind me because they're getting ready
to go on a very exciting walk this
morning they're super excited for that I
have lots to do this weekend so I
thought I'd take you guys along for the
ride of course the ongoing project out
here in the living room main area of
getting all of my stuff from the past
video where I did a bunch of cleanup
actually put back where it's supposed to
be so we'll do that later on also going
to be doing some some new waste
recycling which is also usually really
exciting but I do have a piece of
technology that I'm gonna kind of take
along for the ride for today so let's
let's its it actually just showed up
it's great yes this box let's get this
open
so stuff about the goodwill donation
center to drop off the stuff that was
still useful and I want to point out
right now that I'm not using the the xl2
anymore to record and back in the
standard pixel excel at the and this is
the pixel to excel I don't know what's
going on here but when I try to load the
camera it's just given me nothing it's
give me nothing Google I try to launch
the camera so I can keep vlogging today
I got nothing camera keeps stopping for
now though my errands are pretty much
done except for one the e-waste place
was accepting all the electronics but
they were not accepting actual batteries
discovered that my local Ace Hardware
can can I can take those because you
shouldn't throw battery never throw
batteries in the trash heavy metal let's
get into the water supply that way
that's a bad thing to do some final stop
Ace Hardware and let's see if I can turn
those batteries in
I'll do that here
you know I'm just lost up behind these
hardware it's cool
I looked at the high voltage sign and I
was like it's maybe it's right there oh
here it is yeah
they here's where you can return CFL
bulbs like a big house here and then
this is the battery recycling disposal
just leave it in the pile array for
being responsible and environmentally
friendly I've done the right thing
there's another test with my pixel two
XL I am just clicking the camera button
in the hangouts app and seeing what
happens believe it yeah I did it's
locked up so anytime I try to use the
camera which I was doing this morning
just fine I'm gonna pull the video off
of this so hopefully you've been
watching some of that so far the cameras
just stopped working I'm not any app the
choice to to access it will will freeze
and then it will ask me if I want to
restart it every started the phone
several times I'm gonna try every store
on it and I've tweeted to Google to see
if I can get some help but for now I'm
gonna switch impacts using this for the
rest of this vlog
I did a factory reset and this done
basic setup I didn't do the transfer of
my stuff on to it this time okay Wow
I kind of thought the factory reset
would have fixed it
yeah well guys it is Sunday now and
yesterday was a little bit frustrating a
little bit disappointing at least when
it comes to my new phone my pixel to
excel and as you probably saw at least
part of what was going down
it's my cameras just not working on this
the really frustrating thing and the
thing that kind of made me stop doing
work on this video yesterday was after
realizing that the camera wasn't
functioning properly tweeting about it
because after I went on the pixel paint
like the support page to see what I'm
supposed to do it's like hey it's wheat
to pixels I was like I'm a tweets are
made by tweet to act made by Google so
did that you got a bunch of feedback
from fans and stuff like that and then I
was as I was kind of going over what I
might do to fix the problem
several people suggested a factory reset
which I did on the phone just completely
blanked that all the footage that I
recorded yesterday morning of the dogs
on a wonderful dog walk with bunches of
other dogs ed Q dog footage that would
have been included in this video that
now is not because I that wasn't the
phones fault that was my fault for not
copying and backing that stuff up before
I did the factory reset anyway long
story short is going back I got a refund
RMA for its and I'm just just gonna
return it for a refund
so yay now I don't have to do a review
on the pixel XL - pixel - XL but also
this morning I posted my video of the
cleanup time-lapse that's been going on
over the past couple weeks and I'm
looking at here and I'm like what it
what have I really actually done I have
organized some stuff and as mentioned in
that video I have made some progress but
I'm not feeling like I've really gotten
the progress progressed enough unless
out here his back to where it should be
so today is Sunday I'm gonna set up that
overhead storage thing in the garage and
a moving bunch of this stuff out and I'm
probably gonna do another bit of a time
lapse to add to this vlog video anyway
that's my introduction for Sunday I'm
gonna get to work here goes
to cheer myself up from the loss of my
pixel to excel I'm gonna unbox these
boxes that recently arrived this one is
already started they're not completed
always remember to use more than one
hands when cutting something with a
knife 1070 Ti we meet again
this one's from EVGA it is it's a normal
it's their normal one see they can't
even put SC on there because they the
manufacturers have to ship them all at
the same frequency but I believe this is
their SC version as far as the cooler
goes anyway I'll get to this later
next up though can you figure out where
this one's from this one was
hand-delivered and should be another
1070 TI oh these just they're all over
the place right now this one is from zou
tank this is their mini little fan
cooler and it's actually perfect timing
because it's gonna replace a Founders
edition in there so maybe I should swap
that out real quick there is my 1070 TI
collection thus far because Nvidia was
bored like a that's may 1070 TI were
bored
and here's the entry-level thread Ripper
build with the updated graphics card so
tech gtx 1070 TI mini is a little bit
more space in there and it still only
uses the single 8 pin power connector
also the white LED the zotac logo and
the white LED enter max logo I think
match a little bit better and I still
need to load Windows but the LED on the
motherboard can probably be made to
match or you know a color would go with
the otherwise white LEDs and black stuff
so cool
so now it's time for a little epilogue
for my video because on Monday after my
weekend vlog was supposed to be complete
Joe came over my editor he has been
coming over on Mondays to help me out
get a head start on video work for the
week which has been actually working out
really great but I still had this like
cleaning project that wasn't finished
and I ended up getting frustrated and
and that kind of sucked but if I can
offer words of encouragement to you guys
out there if you're ever feeling
overwhelmed frustrated things are too
cluttered there's too much going on just
remember you can take a deep breath take
a step back from it try not to get too
frustrated and come back to it another
day so that's what I did and over the
past 24 48 hours I have gotten to a
point where I can say I think things are
pretty pretty looking pretty good here
so let me do a quick once-over just to
give you guys the finished product so
living room area one is our home theater
configuration and apart from the stuff
on the shelves everything is pretty much
where it should be turning around to
this area are a very well worn couch we
haven't gotten a new couch because we
have dogs and this couch is we're gonna
use this couch until it falls apart I
think but as you can see things are
fairly tidy there and then looking over
into the far area where most of the work
has been going on Wow dining table is
clear we can eat food and meals on the
dining table like my wife was really
really she is really in a good mood when
she came home last night
largely because of this so that is happy
beyond that of course you're still gonna
see a few things around and I'll try to
point out what's what just some empty
tables over here
those boxes are there permanently for
the most part this gray sheets is
covering all the stuff that I'm gonna be
clearing out and that's mainly covered
with the gray sheet because if I didn't
do that
the comments in this video would be full
of people asking me for the things under
that pile so sorry just to avoid that
I've put a sheet over it
my cornhole board of course I need to
find a better long-term home for that
but it's just blocking the fireplace for
now as well as the the walnut wood that
I got to make the final htpc air for the
dogs over here is pretty well contained
as well there are still some pieces of
my wife's old desk I'm gonna be moving
those two outside actually once I start
getting the outside area set up these
are some donation items either donation
or e-waste just empty boxes these are
the retail boxes and packaging for the
entry level thread River build that I
put together and that's going to be a
giveaway so all those are going to go
out as well we need a better place to
store our vacuum cleaners I guess but if
you're looking at all this loveliness
out here and you're thinking well he
probably just put everything back in the
garage let's go take a look and here is
the garage
well there's here oh he's taking a nap
there here's the garage itself and I
know there's lots of wires and stuff
around it probably makes it a little bit
harder to appreciate the cleanliness and
organize it nests of this area out here
but let's start on the right since I've
showed you this before washer/dryer I
made a shelf over there that's
convenient and then of course the like
normal garage east F which is over on
this side which I've pulled it all out
cleaned reorganized and put the overhead
rack up here to overhead rack is storing
boxes of stuff that's currently in use
so most of these are empty boxes on this
side just so I can easily get out of
them and pull them down if I take a
product out of the rotation and need to
mix that back in but a garage stuff
hardware ladders gardening tools
everything over there this is my end
pile stuff that has arrived that I need
to do something with one way or another
nicely organized over here some tripods
and whatnot
I have a little bit of space in the desk
monitor water cooling stuff and video
graphics cards AMD graphics cards all of
my
motherboards that I'm hanging on to even
got some more space down there I have a
few that aren't in boxes I still need to
arrange their workbench is mostly in
good shape work table is mostly clear
this laptop I am reformatting to hand
over to Jenny because hers died recently
and she needs something to she can take
around this is a G's 73 J from Asus
old-school ROG I had a lot of use out of
that but it's got an SSD in it so it's
still good this is of course my building
tools over here
my entry-level thread Ripper system
which has been recently tested that
video should be up very soon and then of
course we have the charity event coming
ups that will allow people to possibly
win this system or do a donation in
order to potentially win that and then
of course my main work area over here
still very nice and tidy especially the
shelves up here that have again being
rearranged and dusted off and all of
that good stuff oh it's so nice so yeah
Wow does it feel good to have finally
gotten this kind of where I feel like it
should be I do of course have another
big project coming up I'm gonna start
working on outside garage work log more
tech videos coming very soon so guys
