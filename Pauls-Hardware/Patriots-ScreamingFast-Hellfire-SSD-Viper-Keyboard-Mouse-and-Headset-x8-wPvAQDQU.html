coverage here from Las Vegas Nevada I
want to start off by thanking my
sponsors for this event gigabyte deep
pool as well as OCZ a Toshiba company
but Patriot has a whole new set of
peripherals and accessories mice
keyboards headsets I'm gonna go down
those real quick and they have a new m
dot who SSDs will finish with that but
this is the Viper Series patriot Viper
they have Viper memory as well that goes
along with it but they have refreshed
this series especially with the headsets
to sort of unify the design across all
of them and provide different units at
different price points so depending on
how much cash you have you can buy
hopefully at least one of them so let's
start off with the headsets this one
right here is the 330 the V 330 right
yes I got it right the V 330 headset so
this is a little bit more towards your
entry-level there's no LEDs on this one
or anything but it does have a very nice
housing it's very comfortable to wear
I've worn this it's fairly lightweight
the earphones themselves are actually
seems like semi-open they do provide a
little bit of sand
sound dampening outside but you do get a
little bit of that sort of in your head
feel as well does have a flip-down boom
mic so you can fold that down and talk
and what I really like is that it's got
the metal connection points for the
strap so as you're adjusting it that
won't break because metal is the best
way to do that I also has a nicely
braided cable and then on the back of
the ear cup here you have a control for
muting the microphone as well as of
course your volume options so there is
the 330 let's move up to the 361 v3 61
this is actually the successor to the V
360 which is there behind us so this one
you get an upgrade to some LED lights on
the sides so as you can see there lights
up those are red other than that you
have the majority of the same features
that we had with the V 330 although with
the controls on the back you do have the
this base icon it's a little drum so the
base drivers in these or actually can
give you a little bit bit of a vibration
feeling and if you don't like that you
can flip that and turn it off
beyond that the driver sizes are 40
millimeters and there's 7.1 virtual
surround sound as well
I'm getting cues from off camera from
Stacy who is very helpful so there's a
Visa 361 next up let's talk about this
mouse right here the mouse's are all
500s so this is the 530 yes Wow I'm on a
roll here so this is just a nice little
optical mouse RGB lighting 4000 dpi
sensor and then of course you have some
profiles you can program it with and
then you can easily switch between those
with the plus and minus buttons there on
top and of course RGB LED lighting LED
lighting is redundant but I keep saying
it and of course that's a very easy way
to tell which profile you have set up
there for turn back buttons on side
pretty cool design overall viper logo in
the front and there it is alright let's
talk about this keyboard here this is
the 700s the keyboards are 700 so this
is a 730 I'm still correct this one is
using kale Brown switches and so you can
pop those off they have the same type of
switch caps so if you do want to switch
the key caps or something like that you
can it is the same type of one cherry
uses this one's a little bit more in the
budget side it does have a wrist rest
that's fixed I'm going to show you their
other keyboard that has a lot more
additional features but I do like the
lighting options on this there is no
software control so everything is
controlled within the keyboard you have
a function button here and you have a
bunch of different effects that you can
program this with so even though you
have a single color red LEDs going back
there there's a lot of cool effects that
they've already programmed in and I
thought it looked pretty nice there I
was also of course a nice braided cable
but I think if you guys are looking for
a bit more features there's another
version of this that we want to show you
over there so here's the Viper 770
keyboard and this one looks pretty cool
I like the design on this it's got sort
of silver backing and black around again
this is using kale switches they are
actually using the red version of the
kill switches because they got some
requests for that so they're trying to
give the fans what they want all of the
functions on this keyboard can be
controlled when it comes to the lighting
directly with the keyboard but there's
also a software suite so you can use
that as well I like the actual amount of
function buttons that are available up
here to control all of the lighting
because you know if you have a keyboard
that's RGB I find when I use mine like I
set it to one thing and then I just keep
using that over and over
like I'm not really using the diversity
of 16.8 million colors or whatever so
having a bunch of different buttons that
you can easily just switch between
whatever profile suits your fancy it's a
nice way to do that there's also a
detachable wrist breast here at the
bottom and when you pop that off there's
actually a magnet a magnetic connector
that will hold it in place and this also
has an RGB bar that goes across this
this one isn't programmable it'll just
give you that nice rainbow flow across
the entire thing more function buttons
over in the top right media controls so
forward and back play pause all that
good stuff and then a roller here for
the volume which is it's the best way to
do volume on a keyboard the other things
that this has are a pass-through for the
headphones on the right side a pastor
for USB on the left side and again a
very nicely braided cable let's move
over to the headsets I was on a roll but
I missed this one this is the 370 so
this kind of falls in line with this
highest and the 774 the keyboard the 374
this and then the mouse down here is the
570 so this one upgrades you to RGB on
the sides so for the LEDs on the sides
that you can adjust the RGB lighting and
then you also have again that base
switch on the side very nice
construction pretty lightweight overall
and I didn't mention this for the 361
but for the 361 and the 370 you do have
the option of swapping out the ear cups
so it comes with sort of a faux leather
option and then they giving you a cloth
option too which I find is very nice to
have especially if it's warm and like
you sweat like the cloth is way better
than the leather finally for the
peripherals we have the mouse here this
is the 570 this one has a very unique
design it's it's fairly colorful you get
red buttons along here a series of red
buttons here that it would be more
geared towards maybe like a if you're
doing MMO or something like that and you
need lots of different buttons but also
for FPS players up there there is a
sniper button up here that'll reduce the
DPI on the mouse to about 400 so you can
you know get that nice steady sniper
shot RGB lighting if you didn't already
notice all the way across on the scroll
wheel as well as the Viper accent as
well as sort of a little line across the
bottom very nice feel and scroll wheel
here it's a bit of rubberized texture on
the top then of course you can change
between different profiles with the
buttons here and there's actually
different colors as well as four
different options for the profiles that
are loaded in there all these little
buttons on here are programmable which
is cool and then this one has an Avago
laser sensor on the bottom 12,000 dpi
although no one needs that much dpi but
it's there anyway and then this also has
a weight system built into it so you
just pop off the little this little
piece and then you have a set of seven
weights I'm sorry six weights in there
you can install and then you also get a
little case to hold your weights cuz you
know you don't want to just be carrying
those around in your pocket or anything
like that
and lastly since I really like fast SSDs
and I really like MDOT to nvme SSDs
Patriot has one here as well it's called
the Hellfire they have it installed in
this system right under here this is
actually a Norris motherboard by
gigabyte actually this is the z2 70
gaming seven if I'm not mistaken which I
have worked with anyway the read and
write speeds on this thing 3,000
megabytes per second reads 2400
megabytes per second writes that's
really fast I mean even for an MDOT to
nvme drive that's really fast it's very
small it's got a black PCB as well the
sticker is all whites I don't know this
the stickers not the prettiest but you
could peel that off if you really wanted
to but yeah a very nice option and
that's available right now if you want a
really fast MDOT to drive and then all
the peripherals that they have around
here we're expecting those in q2 so
April May June timeframe you can expect
to find those for sale it's reputable
retailers across the world
well not the world at least in North
American and other places like that and
Germany soon too right Germany soon hey

excited for your Patriot products coming
