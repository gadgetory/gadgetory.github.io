with so here's a dress to show cheers
though guys thank you so much for
joining us thanks guys and we begin
Rachael starting off over in the UK
hello to our friends across the pond
advertise broadband speeds that are
dropping actually across the UK and this
is in some places this has been I guess
listed as like UK speeds are slowing
down that is not exactly the case so
just just to clarify a little bit the
speed isn't slowing down the numbers
that are advertised are being slowed
down and this is because new broadband
broadband Advertising Standards were
introduced as of May of this year so
providers have cut the speeds that they
advertise so rather than I guess like so
the problem was that before they were
advertising speeds over too high they
were advertising Peaks beats and this
hasn't been a problem in the US as well
advertised peak speeds and then you go
to try to actually download something at
you know 8:00 at night 7:00 and whenever
they whenever it's very crowded right
now work in your local area for Internet
traffic suddenly you can't achieve those
peak speeds because everyone is actually
sharing the same bandwidth so the rules
that were put in place were to force
internet service providers to actually
advertise the speeds that they can
provide not to make speed claims that
that are you know over there overblown
basically most providers as a result
have cut the speeds that they advertise
or they have stopped meetings making
speed claims altogether these major UK
Internet service providers include but
are not limited to BT EE what's at the
ISP names in the UK John Lewis broadband
that sounds much more English Plusnet
the post office the post office sky talk
talk Utility Warehouse and Zen Internet
any affiliation better if Aaron if
anywhere UK we do have some folks on the
UK watch if you like he said by ISP I
don't know did I do anything here you
know aroused the rules themselves were
changed by the Advertising Standards
authorities or ASA's committee of
advertising practice previously the
advertised basic ADSL packages were up
to 17 megabits per second for the ISP
providers listed above but are now
between 10 and 11 megabits per second
that's
to 41% lower pretty lousy up to 41% more
honest you might say hey I'm prior to
the changes households are paying for
service that were on average fifty one
percent looks lower than advertised mmm
there you go
you k2 effects we have some regulation
that went into place and we have some
truth in advertising as a result and it
would be weird to like so my what I'm
curious about is is it would be existing
packages like if you're already paying
for broadband in the UK like let's sign
up for a two-year contract six months
ago or something like that are they
suddenly switching your plan and like I
paid for the hundred you know megabit
plan and now they're like actually that
plan is now 50 megabit right as a result
of these they're like they haven't
believed people I don't know i I'd be
kind of curious how that actually falls
out but let me strangers we've go the
next one this is this one's stupid and
everyone should be mad about it
I see pie who is largely hated by
everyone who understands net neutrality
and what's been going on in the United
States has admitted that the FCC has
basically lied about the DDoS attacks
and distributed denial of service
attacks happened back in 2017 so we
followed this on the show we've talked
about it many times the FCC and it's
sort of ongoing just weird things that
it's done with with the Internet's going
back to 2015 when they first introduced
net neutrality rules like like we talked
about it back to that back then like Tom
wheeler we weren't sure what Tom wheeler
was gonna do and then they're like
actually we're gonna do title two and
we're gonna actually and we're gonna
enforce net neutrality we had that for a
couple years and then it was 2017 the
FCC introduced what they called the
restoring internet freedom Acts which of
course is named as completely the
opposite thing of what it actually is
and went there all that stuff and
everyone was mad about it but back in
May of last year they opened up a
comments like they were like here's the
order they have to they have to make it
public first and then they have to open
up and allow the public to comment on it
because the FCC is theoretically an
institution that is supposed to serve
the people the citizens
you know and and do things that help us
and make things better so there was a
bunch of people that win and commented
specifically on May 8th 2017 the entire
comet system went down and this was just
his word of spreading about the plan to
kill net neutrality and this was
specifically the effect that's John that
John Oliver had because he did last week
tonight's show about net neutrality that
aired it was very popular a lot of
people saw it a lot of people went to a
link he created he created actually a
couple URLs the people could go to that
would take them directly to the comment
page because before that I was kind of
obfuscated on the FCC website it was
more challenging to get to FCC website
went down so a lot of people who were
trying to go and make a comment right at
that particular time who were feeling
strongly about this weren't able to make
their comments since then there's been a
lot of accusations a lot of people who
have requested information from the SEC
about this supposed DDoS attack and a
GTI and his cohorts have basically said
it was Vitas attack and you know that's
why it went down and and and we're gonna
kill net neutrality anyway anyway it's
done so they've now come out and
admitted specifically that it wasn't or
that it wasn't a DDoS attack it was
simply an increase in traffic as a
results of the show publishing some
tweets went out about it the actual
reason that he has come out and made a
statement about this is because the the
inspect the Inspector General sorry I'm
I know let's go
the FCC inspector general's office
investigated this incident and issued a
comprehensive report yesterday initially
even as you PI and all these douchebags
were trying to hold that back and not
let it go public it was publicized
earlier today it's linked in the article
I did read over some parts of it but
they list all these things that went on
when when the last week tonight showing
up and it came down to a 3101 16 percent
increase in traffic to the FCC site
between May 7th and May 8th the evening
of May 7th and then the next day
eighth cousin lips had to go down so
ultimately this is and to be to be
completely fair here the the comment
system was then opened for I think three
months after that they received nearly
twenty four million comments about the
restoring Internet freedom order so it's
not like this a hundred percent
prevented people from going and posting
their comment but the fact is they lied
about it
for well over a year anytime anyone who
asked about it they lied about it
anytime people tried to request that
they investigate it further to actually
determine the source of it they did
nothing then basically said now just
ddos attack we're not going to talk
about it more so what was the point
though of lying about it like what the
point of the point of lying about it is
to continue to continue apparently the
trend of lying about things in order to
trick people into believing things that
aren't true
I mean also also the point of lying
about it was was probably to make an
excuse because you know they're supposed
to be able to take comments from people
people who are supposed to be able to go
and offer their opinion about this thing
and the fact that the site went down
like if they said the site went down
because we were flooded like that is
somewhat legitimate right but the fact
that they made something up and then
tried to make an excuse about it and now
that the statement has actually been
made
he hasn't even taken assumed
responsibility himself he said the FCC's
former CIO chief information officer
David Bray is actually the one who who
who is at fault here and he was very
What did he say
I'm deeply disappointed that the FCC's
former chief information officer David
Bray who was hired by the prior
administration and it's no longer with
the Commission provided inaccurate
information about this incident to me my
office Congress and the American people
this is completely unacceptable and also
disappointed that some working under
former CIO apparently either disagreed
with the information you're presenting
or had questions about anyone damn so it
seems like I feel like he's throwing out
they like hired to by the prior
administration like he had to throw it
out there you know who else was hired by
the prior administration Ajit PI
you freakin that's a new low for very
long time they did not investigate it
over the past year the only reason that
it's even coming out right now is
because an intended part and it's an
independent investigation by the
inspector inspector general took place
they knew that this information was
going to come out and so as has been the
trend they tried to make the make this a
public statement about it beforehand in
order to come out ahead of the bad news
and frame it in the way that he wants to
but so if I'm reading this right it
seems like the FCC lied about there
being DDoS attacks in order to sort of
sabotage their own platform for from
people voicing their concerns about net
neutrality well I mean there's like
there's information that we don't know
for sure there's accusations that could
be made but there we don't have any
proof about it like was somebody at the
at the FCC who really wanted net
neutrality to die and was worried about
a bunch of comments coming in that
supported it like did they actively go
and shut the site down at a time when a
bunch of people were trying to access it
and make comments right that's that's
not that's not known for sure what is
known for sure according to the
Inspector General general's report is
that it was not indeed like there was
not an external attack that caused this
to happen right so okay so that's stupid
oh they're all bunch of douche bag liars
ultimately even after many many comments
came in they they still repealed or they
still went through what they're starring
in a freedom order and ignored what
everyone had to say about it or at least
ignored at least at least didn't
investigate further to check in to the
24 million comments that came through to
determine which members of them were
legitimate and which ones weren't
the repeal actually took effect last
actually two months ago and now June 8th
but in the meantime the Senate has voted
252 247 to overturn it's actually that
was back in May still needs of course
the house to act on it which probably
won't happen many states have introduced
legislation to produce net neutral to
have introduced legislation to protect
net and child
at the local level as well so there's
not necessarily no hope for for this but
it's pretty lame that live with for so
long all right let's move on it's
bleeping computer has an article about
new methods to crack WPA and wpa2
passwords this is specifically on a tour
2.11 networks Jen's Adam stupid stupid
Steve dub I don't know how to pronounce
his last name someone's name that were
pronounced yes that's his name
Jen's his first his name is Jen's
there's only one of him and his name is
Jen's
that sounds Nordic perhaps sounds like
that it sounds like there'd be two of
them anyway
Jen's just clarify Kyle's one making fun
of your name not me he recently
discovered a new technique easily
retrieves the PM k ID or pairwise master
key identifier from a router using WPA
or wpa2 security which is what most
people have most people if you're
reasonably up on your home internet
security wpa2 is probably what you were
running right now once you get that pmk
ID you can then use it to crack the
wireless password of the router and then
access the network which is a little
scary
Jen's is the but is the developer of the
hash Kat password cracking tool and he
made the discovery while looking for new
ways to crack WPA 3 so let's check it
out WPA 3 and found a vulnerability with
WPA and wpa2 the pmk is part of a normal
form of handshake that is used to
confirm that both the router and the
client know the pre shared key or PSK so
there's two things we're talking about
here PM k PS k appreciate appreciated
key is effectively your wireless
password to your wireless network at
home the P it so yeah exactly previously
for to do an attack on WPA or wpa2
protected routers the crackers would
require I'm sorry the attacker would
have to wait for an actual logon maker
back resistant crackers it's a it's a
racial slur against white people false
or false really hungry
we're gonna be back to my own people in
land okay um that's absolutely sick
enough right never mind
what am i I'm getting distracted here so
damn crackers previously if an attacker
wanted to actually get into your WPA or
wpa2 protected Network you'd actually
have to be there when a logon took place
this new attack simply has to attempt to
authenticate the wireless network at
Retriever and a tree with single frame
in order to get access to that pmk ID it
should be pointed out that the pmk
allows you to access a hash that
contains the pre shared key you're
following all this Kyle oh definitely
with you okay but the hash still needs
to be cracked but you can take longer or
shorter depending on the complexity of
your password okay so great all right so
- - you've got your device you've got
your red and you've got your router
right both devices have two sets of
information okay
pmk and the pants and the PSK right they
share those to confirm that the
connection is legitimate like you enough
to know you have to know the password in
order to access it so there's a hidden
piece of that and then there's the
password that you know okay it's the the
attack finds the hidden piece right so
it'll it allows you to send that hidden
piece over and ask for the for the key
the key right but the key that it gets
back is encrypted mm-hmm right hey
follow me now okay okay so they get
really attached
it's basically so right once they get
that hash then they can attack that and
they can try to crack it and the
difficulty of cracking that depends on
the complexity of your original password
so if your wireless password is like
it's not or something you know if it's
like if it's like if it's like a four or
five letter word or something and
there's no cat
you know it's short and simple then it's
gonna be very easy to crack in this
situation some two three four five yes
it's the same faster to having my
luggage alright so the lesson the lesson
for you folks at home
use a long and complex password on your
Wi-Fi perhaps go and change it right now
maybe consider updating upgrading to WPA
three capable stuff in the future that
we've talked a little bit about WP three
but I don't think that's widely
available yet and also if your router
has an automatic password generator you
shouldn't use that because knowing what
type of router you have which they can
sometimes access by wirelessly then they
can use that information in order to
make it much easier to crack the hash ok
ok ok let's move up cool well I look I
managed to understand that by the very
end of I love the article I love that
story up the whole time ok moving on -
all right one more one more net watch
thing here Microsoft is a bit of a rumor
earlier this week that Microsoft is
going to be turning Windows 10 into a
paid subscription service and you access
Windows over the Internet which is why
this totally belongs in that watch so
this this herechickey this is actually
an opinion article which it means he can
use you can make fun of people and stuff
so it's kind of a fun read if you guys
are interested but it's not true
basically this started when details
about something called Microsoft managed
desktop Microsoft managed desktop
emerged some people were saying it's
gonna replace Windows 10 and you'd have
Microsoft managed desktop and then if
you have Windows 10 you have to pay a
monthly fee now to use it that's
ridiculous it's not the case Microsoft
managed desktop is actually a desktop
service plan meant for businesses I
don't know how this initial confused and
confusion and cropped up but Microsoft
managed desktop will be a single monthly
fee but let's a business lease a
physical PC so there's actually Hardware
involved that is automatically
provisioned or set up for that business
this PC will run Windows 10 and
Microsoft will keep the operating system
up to date and ensure those updates
don't cause problems okay so yes there
is a potential future Microsoft has
played around with different different
models for Windows 10 and how much you
pay for it and
you know whether you're logging in with
your individual idea whether it's
actually attached to the computer
they've messed with that there might be
paid Windows versions in the future we
don't know Windows 10 already has a fair
amount of advertising built into it as
well as telemetry being sent back to
Microsoft so they are making money off
of the operating system aside from the
money that just the consumers pay for it
that's why I am perfectly ok telling
people to go and pay $30 for an
International Windows license that they
get from my kinguin or something like
that because it's still a legit license
it's just less expensive because
Microsoft knows they can't charge your
hundred bucks for Windows 10 licensed
globally because different countries
have different economies and I can't
afford to pay for that and stuff so
point being don't forget about this
let's move up ok ok good
all right let's move on from that watch
- I feel like now watch was muddy what
are you doing next guy something less
money like regular tech news regular old
tech news nothing to do with the
Internet in any such way I promise hate
the Internet
alright sucks 3rd Ripper 3rd Ripper -
actually yesterday had an embargo lifts
for unboxings of the of the reviewers
kits that were sent out to people also a
a bit of an info dump confirming pricing
some dates for availability did anyone
know stuff like that did anyone else did
anyone get like a different ship than
the 2950 x yeah who like everyone
everyone got the 2990 WX what who I got
to tell me now so I can kill them I have
to kill you know it depends it depends
on the region and stuff like that it
seems kind of weird cuz like Jay didn't
get one yeah but that seems a little
strange to me it does seem like so much
to him later yeah and maybe offered it
to us but I was I was this close to
being in the same boat as Jay because
AMD contacted me and said hey cow we're
we're not sure if this product aligns
with your audience you know you seem to
have a gay Murray audience but let us
know if you think otherwise and maybe we
can make something work and I replied
back and said thanks for eating out
basically I
have a ton of viewers who are heavily
involved in like the workstation arena
and would love content on thread Ripper
would be potential buyers even and then
I got hooked up with like the press
briefing and everything but that I
attended with you I don't know if J got
that same email that courtesy email
saying like hey we're kind of on the
fence about sending you a sample but
they did reach out to me so funny if he
did and he just ignored it he could have
just missed the emails contacts no yeah
he's got peeps I mean that's so so so
for any confusion here and like I
understand people who are like man J
should have gotten one or whatever like
from the marketer from the marketing
perspective at AMD and I think the
reason this happened is they are trying
to clarify that these crazy high core
count CPUs that they're coming out with
the cause cost upwards of a thousand
dollars are not made for everyone
they are high-end workstation parts most
people aren't going to be able to make
use out of them most games don't require
more than four cores so it seems like
they're trying to point it seems like
they don't want to be accused as like
we've seen Intel accused of with certain
bits of their marketing material with
their high core count products that like
they're trying to like advertise this to
gamers when like no gamer and is right
my needs to spend eats anything anything
that's that's that crazy high-end so I
don't know I think J will probably end
up with one and he'll probably do videos
that well he confirmed on Twitter that
AMD got in contact with him that day
taking care of them why are you even
letting me go off on that I didn't want
to interrupt you you're you're on a roll
just enjoyed making you look sad guys
behind the times all right all right
back to the thread Ripper stuff 2990 WX
if you guys weren't already aware
pre-orders started yesterday for the
2990 WX specifically the only thing you
can pre-order right now is that crazy
32 core 117 99 or $1,800 is what it's
gonna cost for the 29
vx it will actually ship out next week
August 13th so six days from today on
Monday $900 for the 16 core 29 50x
that's what Kyle and I got that is I
thought they were saying that's also
going it for P order but I haven't seen
it actually available anywhere no I
think it's just a 32 core that's
available okay
but that's not available until the end
of the month so that one's got like it
three more yeah
weeks or so on it until it's actually
available so all this nonsense started
over in Italy they had an event there
and Maranello idiot Italy member rvs and
supercars and stuff like that they
apparently drove around very fast but
the the CPUs themselves though not to
get too distracted by the fast cars also
include a couple lower core count ones
it'll be a little bit more reasonably
priced a little bit not available until
October the $1,300 2970 WX which is 24
core and 48 thread CPU and then finally
another 12 core 29:20 X so the successor
to the 1920 X and that one's 650 dollars
mm-hmm and again both available at the
end of October so it's pretty cool I
think here is that AMD came out with new
like the successor like the 29 50 X and
the 29:20 X are the successor to the
1950 X and the 1920 X they are faster
same core and thread count and
everything but they made them cheaper
like they're less expensive out of the
gate I can I can appreciate a price drop
for an X for a product of the next
generation that's one year later but
that's also demonstrably better in
various ways yeah of course due to the
12 nanometer manufacturing process and
the higher frequency better memory
compatibility all that good stuff
but Tom's Hardware credit to them they
actually was so distracted by the video
I've just been watching that little
video the whole time you were talking
look who they're doing cool things with
VR and robots stop getting this Jack
decal all right
blame comes hardly here's a chart though
where you can see all the the currently
known specs wings different things I
like that they put that price per core
here compare this to the 79 80 X 100 and
an $11 five hundred and eleven dollars
per quart yep
the twenty nine and ninety WX is fifty
six dollars for core per core all these
are in the like fifty five dollar range
would be like like literally pretty much
half of what you pay for core principle
now granted Intel's got a little bit
better instruction for clock and
everything so the core is are directly
comparable definitely not twice the
amount of performance certainly not that
so Tom's however did though is they took
some existing information and they made
a fun chart here others there's some
unboxings and stuff as well there's the
actual box this church did the did the
box for the record not remind you of the
the diamond play button on YouTube all
right kinda with the with all the
tessellation in it yeah very much I
almost felt like I had ten million
subscribers when I was in boxing that
thing one day Kyle one day one day one
day thirty five years from now he's
gotta keep making those when I'm 80 just
keep making those stack attack videos
alright so this is this chart here that
I thought I thought was pretty
interesting and telling so I wanted to
at least show you guys that again
articles or that we're talking about -
they're all linked in the video's
description
this is Cinebench r15 and this
information was specifically drawn from
the footnotes in the press deck that
went out that was made public yesterday
as well as results from the ln2
overclocking demo specifically done at
that event in Italy and there's there's
a couple pictures of sellin twos
mysterious clouds of stuff anyway but
here's the 29.92 WX they overclocked
it's a 5.1 gigahertz across all cores
granted exotic cooling with Alan - but
they scored seven thousand six hundred
and eighteen in Cinebench all cores
which is a pretty massive epic score
ands
yes does beats Intel scores that they
did at Computex with their 28 core demo
that received a lot of scrutiny and a
lot of a lot of a lot of
yes a because they were using $1,000
water chiller right to cool it and they
didn't necessarily disclose that upfront
also they were like this is the 28 core
5 gigahertz CPU that were launching this
year didn't mention overclocked didn't
mention that it was mentioned the word
overclocking it was I mean and claimed
they forgot to say it yeah excuse well
we just forgot to say it was running
overclock it's kind of lame but AMD
meanwhile with this product which is
available to consumers next week by the
way
7000 618 stock a granite that's a pretty
big jump over the stock score of 5000 89
but the stock score some pretty insane
is dominating Intel's currently fastest
available or 79 80 XC which is an 18
core and then they listed some other
available CPU scores there as well so
yeah already rocking a thread Ripper 16
core are suddenly feeling like man
feeling in absolutely inadequate yeah
yep give me some more cores 24 core that
I feel like the 24 core is also a nice
option in there for someone who doesn't
want to spend close to 2,000 yeah let's
see that one's won $12.99 yeah well
that's 1,300 so I'm good good price so
you can you can climb the ladder
wherever your budget falls in the
high-end desktop AMD platform which is
fun reviews for the 2990 WX and the 2950
X which I believe are the only two CPUs
that were sent out and sampled are gonna
be out on August 13th Lou so Steve stay
tuned for those subscribe and all that
stuff yep all right
I'm gonna try to go more quickly now
because we started late and we're
already run into a lot of time but not
being slow for any of you guys who were
super fascinated by those all the said
their third report ooh stuff and want a
little bit more information we have some
more information here now Kyle and I
aren't gonna comment on this we're just
gonna show you but this video here is
from Leo Leo Leo from kick guru what do
you hang out with him at some of the
events that we go to and stuff he posted
a video yesterday along with the third
order for to launch that had some slides
in it
it's a video still up it appears to be
video still there so go over to guru
Tech if you wanna watch the video or
click it here it's linked in the video
cards article and from the description
but yeah it had a bunch of slides in it
that weren't necessarily part of the
press deck that went live yesterday so
some additional information here and
again this is we're not gonna go into
too much detail here just point out to
you guys that it is available if you
want to look at some of these slides the
information includes Rison master
profiles for threader / - has some
comparisons of uma vs Numa which has
already discussed with the first
generation threader / stuff as far as
the memory access modes going from Creon
your mode to gaming mode for example but
there's more details on that for third
over to pricing of the rate strippers
down here at the bottom as well the
wreath Ripper is it the cooler it is
upper way through 250 watt TDP cooler
that cooler master designed in
collaboration with AMD and it says it's
gonna be $100 of course all this
information could be completely fake Lea
probably made all these slides to try to
fool people
oh that Kyle's got a read-through for
anything I'm sure you guys were wanting
like you know comparison visual aid a
visual aid and in comparison to like
hand size like look at how fat this
thing is it's a pretty big cooler so I
will say massive some of course there's
older coolers like the v8 they made and
stuff like that that's supposed to a car
engine
I never really liked them very much for
some reason I just I thought they were
large and kind of just just hold you in
and and cumbersome it felt like it'll
take this this is class it's very large
but this feels a lot whatever yeah it
just feels a lot more well put together
the fin stack is nice it's got really
high quality nickel plating on
everything it's two fin stacks with a
fan in between yeah there's a fan in
between here fans have betted in the
middle there
RGV of course I haven't even seen it
what the RGB loaded up and I haven't
figured out exactly how to mount it have
you no mess with these no I haven't like
do these these these go down here and
like obviously this is not a something
that's simple to remove
oh yeah have you been careful with the
trophies no not at all I'm planning to
just remove it when I if I do mount it
yeah so I think these you must be able
to remove caps on or maybe you can just
screw that cuz these have maybe these go
all the way down these might go all the
way down to these and just you just
tighten it right there that'd be that'd
be very simple that would be nice oh
cool yeah I can definitely see this
being in like a workstation build it
looks professional and classy enough to
be in one where as until you turn the
RGB party on yeah just just don't plug
that cable in moving on though Intel a
little bit information about ten
nanometer we've talked a bit about that
10 nanometer has been delayed multiple
times the process was supposed to
deliver area reductions of over 50
percents when compared to Intel's 40
nanometers process initially it was
slated for a 2015 release
it's now been officially pushed back and
until has stated this publicly to q4
2019 so still over a year off until 10
nanometer is actually going to be
available at least available in
quantities that they have products there
have been there's like one or two like
laptops that have come out with 10
nanometer stuff in him but like they
were really phantom launches they were
they were paper launches or such limited
quantities that no one was actually able
to reasonably go and find one or buy one
anyway that semi accurate has now
released a report claiming Intel is now
downgrading their 10 nanometer process
to make the process production rate
ready so not just the timing delays but
actually downgrading the process
sacrificing some of their die space and
area savings so that they can improve
their manufacturing yields enough to
make 10 nanometer financially viable so
does that mean that they've they've
increased the die size from what they
originally went with it's it's difficult
to tell exactly and this is obviously
not a hundred percent confirmed or
anything this is Charlie from semi
accurate and his reporting so you know
gotta gotta gotta take his word for it
some degree but definitely doesn't seem
like
good news if there is any grain of truth
to it he said he went so far as to say
that Intel's new 10 nanometer will be
effectively a 12 nanometer process which
puts it on par with what Andy is
currently shipping with the resin 2000
series stuff and further for 2000 series
stuff 10 nanometer delays have been
blamed on factors ranging from company
mismanagement to overly high ambitions
for the node and technical issues that
stem from cutting-edge silicon
production which is pretty vague but I'm
not trying to put too fine a point on it
here due to these delays of 10 nanometer
other fabs that make microchips have
caught up a lot of mint on Intel tsmc
Samsung and Global Foundries
you Intel used to have several years of
sort of a head start on them when it
comes to transistor density and
performance and that really has kind of
evaporated in the past few years it
seems like so good for anyone who's
looking for more competition bad for
anyone who who I mean there's still had
people who like Intel and use their
products and you know they're not bad
products but like I don't know I was
anticipating I've said this before I was
anticipating that when AMD started you
know producing actual competitive
products again that Intel was gonna be
like oh here's this thing that we've
been sitting on for the past year we're
just gonna drop that which can you know
wipe the floor with your new product
brain that definitely doesn't seem to be
the case even to the extent that they're
having to push their stuff back really
far so I think Intel just underestimated
AMD so hard that our that they were just
yeah that they were just focusing on all
the other you know thousand things that
Intel has their pockets in and hands him
I was like to talk about when we talk
about overall company performance and
stuff I do like to take a look at stock
prices Intel stock price took a big dip
at the end of last month relatively
speaking dropped five points from 52 to
about 47 if you look at the year I mean
you know pause not bad they wrote those
are still positive and
everything but um definitely a lot more
piddling around I feel like over the
best however many months versus where
they could be
AMD meanwhile this is their one day I
was at five days oh look at that five
whoo things are looking good how about
the one month oh damn
whoo that jump was that July it was just
July July I mean they were they were in
the around the ten around ten for quite
a while yeah and then they've jumped up
recently sued about twenty twenty issues
so there we go
stocks stocks that should be a should be
a segment who's just called stocks I'd
be fun to say I don't I wouldn't I
wouldn't know much be stocks with an ass
like I don't I don't I don't invest in
stocks a I I do it to maintain
credibility because if I was invested
for instance if I own stock in AMD or
Intel then it would be in my best
interest to tell you guys that the
company I own stock in was good so that
it would maybe sell more stuff hey
Tobias and that would be a conflict of
interest of interest yep
cuz stay honest that's why I just I
bought stock and all all all the big
companies that way I'm equally
non-biased
as well alright let's talk about this is
these this is actually really good news
for people who like SSDs and are getting
a little tired of like continuing with
the 240 gig or 500 gig varieties that
have been out for quite a while yeah
it's old neutrally prices have come down
for those but still would be nice to be
able to more easily drop a one or two
terabyte SSD into a system
Samsung's hopefully gonna be helping out
with that by initiating mass production
of qlc v-nand
for their consumer and for terabyte SSDs
we checked if your wife is messaged you
about that
oh good good good good yeah see I'm on
top of that nope
cool alright so Samsung made this
announcements that they're now did yes
they've started production specifically
for bits qlc this is quad level cell
and so if you're familiar with NAND
flash memory that's SLC it's in the
level so you can't really get that from
what I understand it's used in some like
very specific use cases for like
military applications and stuff but SLC
is like insanely reliable and durable
but it's a single bit per cell in the
NAND flash which if you move to two bits
per cell which is what a lot of stuff is
suddenly you have twice the amount of
bits that can be stored three bits per
set three bits per cell has been and
wide use for the past two three years I
feel like maybe even a little bit longer
now we have four bits per cell so each
cell can store four bits of data more
more data density effectively is what
we're looking at here I have not looked
at any of these white papers or anything
to figure out more accurately how are
they doing that and I only have a vague
understanding of that anyway so point
being what Samsung is producing
specifically is 64 layer one terabit
v-nand chips so each little chip is one
terabit holy so eight of those little
chips would be one terabyte eight bits
to a byte makes sense with the higher
cool on the higher density and they're
stating that this still retains the
performance level supported by current
three bit SSDs because usually when you
go from two bits per cell the three bits
per cell the four bits per cell you get
more storage capacity but you sometimes
have a drop-off in performance as well
as sometimes a drop-off in durability
the length that the right the right
endurance that many how many times a
cell be able to be written and rewritten
over again before it stops working these
are gonna be mainstream parts 2.5 inch
SATA SSDs as you can see in this picture
I think this is just a generic Samsung
SSD picture but looks good enough right
so they're gonna have standard SSD
speeds that you guys might already be
familiar with kind of old news when it
comes to like five hundred and forty
megabytes per second reads 520 megabytes
per second writes but the capacity is
really the story here available one
terabyte two terabyte and four terabyte
capacities so that's cool
and Santa based SSDs are still fast
enough for like the vast majority of use
yes
people don't need the extra extra speed
from you know some crazy like something
like a Samsung 970 Evo or something like
that they are working on MDOT two
versions of these using the qlc NAND
flash and qlc nvme Enterprise SSDs will
begin mass-production later this year
and they can also use qlc beam and to
efficiently produce a four to 128
gigabyte microSD cards for smartphones
so Samsung upcoming phones might have
like crazy
lots amount of storage which would be
fun because they can always use that to
like poke fun at Apple and Apple never
Apple always likes to charge you like
200 bucks for an extra 16 gigs of memory
and stuff right sounds accurate though
unfortunately we don't have any shipping
window or pricing which is why I brought
this last story up this is a review from
PC perspective of the intel SSD 660 p a
new SSD from intel they're reviewing the
one terabyte version of this and this is
an Allen Melvin tano review which means
it's insanely in-depth and thorough here
is his actual visual representation of
four bits per cell so SLC right yep
and I'll see there's more storage
density there you go here's the actual
SSD itself it's just a simple little
green pea green PCB deal but the specs
on it are reasonably good the price to
storage capacity is a good story here
512 gig nvme m2 SSD hundred hundred
dollars Wow one hundred two hundred
dollars for the one terabyte and $400
for the two terabyte so skills in a
pretty linear fashion pcie 3.0 by four
800 megabytes per second sequential read
and write speeds both so kind of
symmetrical in that respect 250,000 max
uh ops random 4k reads and writes
so specs that are not among the highest
or the fastest when it comes to nvme
SSDs but certainly well above I that's
well but over three times the speed that
you get with SATA yeah
reads in
it's like what were you just talking
about so it's priced accordingly so yeah
so nice again check out the article if
you want to look at some of the more
detailed results Alan does such a really
good job here and I feel like it's
there's such a density information of
information I can never go through
everything sure like the the blue line
here is the 660 P the higher up lines
here are like the WD black ones here
right which is pretty fast in the 970
but one terabyte and the blue line I
mean I'm just generically speaking as I
scroll through here you know it's not up
there with the highest end but it's
right there in the mid range for the
speeds of these nvme SSDs the WD black
faster than the 970 Evo it depends on
what you're doing with it yeah
and he has a lot of different tests a
lot of different look that's not my wife
solicitor yes so final results pros
highly competitive Cossack you bite
outstanding random performance for a
mainstream budget SST generis generis
generous generous dynamic SOC county
relationships
it's our Gary another queen of direct
mother of Trek it's got a really nice
SLC so SLC cash so like it can cache
data to that right for that but if you
have have you sustained workloads the
con is that it can saturate that cache
and results in low qlc rates beans but
again for what this is a name for most
people are probably not going to be able
to do that Ellen's able to do that
because he runs tests that that
specifically synthesized that type of
action happening 20 cents per gig that's
what you're looking at there that's nice
okay cool we have one final segment and
I think I'm gonna do one of these two
questions that's let's not do both let's
skip let's skip the the thread Ripper to
unboxing video thing and let's just do
an intel versus AMD alright okay third
fate wait sir thank you until vs. Indy
who is winning do you know can I post it
in chat yes yes you can
there you go all right guys
go yeah answer be free this is the one
that we're not doing okay don't don't
answer that one Intel versus Amy who's
winning so we've been talking a lot
about Intel versus and beer and now what
do you think Intel you got AMD this is
you know we have to take a look at this
every so often so it's q3 right now of
twenty quarter three of 2018 and you
know I think there's arguments that
could be made either way look how you
gotta you gotta make a choice and we
have to make this decision right now and
we have to tell people all right all
right I'm gonna I'm gonna be I'm gonna
I'm gonna take the the low road and go
with the obvious answer because it's
right which is AMD obviously Paul AMD
team red has been crushing it lately
okay they they have come out with so
many good family launches of CPUs GPU
side we're gonna say family friendly
like yeah sorry good family friendly
CPUs none of them curse okay so we've
got mainstream rise in second gen and
then rise in better per second gen which
was just sort of announced or officially
given more details just this week and
the price to performance that you're
that we're seeing with these chips are
vastly outweigh the competition Intel
cannot hold a flame I can't hold a
candle to what AMD is packing right now
I think just the the pricing &amp;amp; features
is really where it's at with AMD I see a
lot of people you know when I take polls
on Twitter regularly you know do you
want to see an Intel builder or Rison
build and everyone wants to see AMD
right now I think just because it's kind
of it's more user it's more targeted for
the user and I feel like Intel is often
just kind of a cash grab doing the same
thing that they've been doing small
iterations generation over generation
and now you can clearly see Intel
struggling to keep up with with AMD I
think AMD has a lot of momentum right
now
that the fans are just loving so IIIi
would say I would say AMD that's
probably like my sword fight answer and
my personal answer as well making this
personal now it's personal I see how it
is I'm gonna personally win I've also
realized that we could sword fight
completely skipped over one of the
stories we were supposed to talk about
from WCC f technology which directly
relates to this you see I had it all
tied in with my with my planning and
then I just dropped the ball missed you
meant to drop the mic but instead this
is a report from Germany's biggest
retailer mind Factory mine factory dot
de and I'm still gonna go back to
answering the sword fight and you know
obviously I have after apply to Kyle
here but this this proves my point here
so these are the number of CPUs sold in
July and we can actually see that AMD
has retaken the lead here so what this
chart might be difficult to look at at
first yes vixens video but let me
explain each month down here at the
bottom right there's two vertical bars
the bar on the left is AMD in the bar on
the right is Intel okay that explains it
right and what's over here is the stack
of CPUs that they're actually looking at
when it comes to sales guy from Intel or
from AMD so they're using this to look
at the total number of CPUs sold yeah I
never compare one to the other
now interestingly enough back when Intel
launched their ninth generation stuff
which I thought was not the best lunch
to be perfectly honest their ninth gen
the ninth gen stuff to Z 370 okay that
came out late last year that we all
thought was fairly rushed it really
boosts like they if you look at December
January February March April May June
Intel has been selling and again this is
just a single retailer in Germany but
based on this Intel has been outselling
AMD by pretty significant it's only just
this last month in July that AMD has
overtaken Intel and it's still very
close with overall 50% to 50% but if you
look at last year you can see that AMD
was in the lead their first generation
stuff
was doing pretty well so compare that
then however and this is where my
argument comes back in to the amount of
money being made when Intel CPUs are
sold because even though AMD has sold
more CPUs in Intel their revenue the
actual money they are making is
significantly less because AMD has been
putting their CPU on sale CPUs on sale
lowering the value basically
undercutting themselves you know sure
they give a better value to the customer
who's out there but what's it really
come down to when you're arguing you
know the AMD versus Intel arguments and
I think it comes down to scoreboard
scoreboard Cal what here's the
scoreboard for AMD's revenue in 2017
five point three three billion okay
let's check the scoreboard for Intel
Kyle okay seven D sorry sixty-two point
seven six billion that's what I call
scoreboard money talks Intel wins but
but that's for 2017 your straw poll
clearly says q3 of 2018
that's just our individualists that's
how we feel about it right now
oh that's what really matters you're so
feeling we know about it okay exactly
please very scientific this arguments
become when we involve emotions okay I
will I mean and if you want to get
specific I would guarantee that the
actual revenue numbers for Intel are
still way way above No No maybe is
certainly quadrupled actually actually
comes around making 35,000 is the amount
that they were in 27 let's see what you
guys think though Andy whoa look at that
what put a lance excellent choice Kyle
obviously AMD and hey if we're if we're
going by how people feel right now which
obviously this is just a random straw
poll people who are watching a live show
about technology and very much about how
people feel
AMD doing a bunch of sales which is her
their revenue but increase the number of
CPUs they have sold and also allowed
people to buy sea views for less money
and maybe get more for their money
people tend to appreciate that
yeah which i think is reflected here and
I think even if maybe from a business
standpoint they're you know taking a
loss on all the deals that they're
making like it's it's very much like
when you're a brand like AMD or until
it's very much an image thing like how
the audience how the consumer base
perceives you and I think even if you're
taking a loss you're kind of investing
in your brand image like you know what
do people think of when they think of
AMD in this moment and I think that
that's currently ahead of a head of
Intel and to their credit their stock
price has been reflecting that certain
bounce back so I think yeah it's the
trends that have started kind of last
year with the initial rise in launch
continued this year and Intel really is
that far off with their next gen stuff
and I mean what to see what what
whatever whatever this next generation
of products that they're launching
because they're supposed to be launching
some new products soon and a new line of
CPUs and stuff and z 390 and you know
ten core and all that but it's all still
supposed to be 14 nanometers so we might
see you know III I don't know what sort
of performance increase they're gonna
get I guess so who Intel or AMD Intel
yeah with this next gen so what to see
Lindsey and it's bringing all of you the
information as it happens okay we sure
will
oh let's finish off my half of the show
with the final segment which is of
course QA anyway sent in a donation
comment thank you so much and we're
gonna try to answer these quickly
because there's quite a few position X
$5 did you get did you to get my tweets
about the charity challenge I don't know
challenge I did not I I do not well I
don't see any tweets about a charity at
all what were they all right like I said
I didn't see anything
wait he he followed up the thing
expertly has a short attention span
another kisses follow-up tweet rather
than explaining to us what the charity
challenge is
which would have ensured that his $5
wasn't wasted if we didn't know what it
was followed up with recommendation for
a bare-bones low-cost case that can hold
a minimum of 48 preferably 96 hard
drives who cares about the charity
anyway building a large NASA what's what
it take good what a recognition hard
drives you're looking at a wreck you
want a wreck mount you want to go wreck
mount with that yeah you're gonna
massive distance it's who you I don't I
don't know I don't know all that you
need you want to go rack mount for that
if you really want that many hard drives
um you want to put it in a room where it
can have a bare-bones low cost case no
that doesn't exist yeah you're on a
different planet right bazinga you need
to bring yourself down to reality where
you realize cases do not hold 48 traffic
a minimum yeah for you or two different
to you Rex you want a shelf preferably
one that's very reliable from a trusted
brand the one that I have that Wendell
actually sold me for a very good price
is from LSI oh yeah it's a 24 rack desk
shelf and it's been fantastic since I
got it so you might want to look into
something like that you're gonna you're
gonna need to set up an actual server
where you're gonna have like a case that
can house like a motherboard and CPU and
you're gonna attach that with like a
raid card or something okay we need to
move on okay sorry
thank you for accepting donations
serpent XS x SF $5 donation Cal did you
get rid of my bit wit poster I sent you
I'm hurt to /cry I'm hurt slide cry my
wife said to be nice to wife you saw
haven't showed my support in a while
take care did you get a bit with poster
I did not see any poster if it came in
the mail then I have not checked my
mailbox
my PA box in way too long so yeah do
that next week well next week we'll do
mail times am/fm next week I probably
have an overflowing box okay that's what
she said
MB 67 lenticular 1337 thank you for the
lead donation
choose right back to you sir yes thank
you
County woman with the ten dollar
donation was the vrm for an AC starter
districts X - 99 - X e suitable for an
Intel 79 80 X key if you are not o
seeing I'm thinking it may be better to
get a motherboard with 12 phase delivery
thank you guys for what you do Johnny
ball and I'm not immediately familiar
with that specific motherboards power
delivery setup but I know Asus typically
does a good job especially with their RG
Strix motherboards so it expect if
you're not overclocking yes that should
be perfectly suitable to push a 79 80 XC
since it's a CPU that's supposed to work
on that platform that would be my
expectation yeah
so without without knowing too much
further in-depth information I would say
yes you're probably okay I'm looking at
the board and it it looks pretty I mean
it's a it's a $600 board you need to
find it somewhere else okay so that
that's not that's that's more than there
are G rampage 6/4 okay okay what's next
it's probably fine now Thank You Johnny
Bijan 24/7
five dollars currently have a Strix ten
seven even want to be able to play any
game at max settings no problem in the
future should I wait on the eleventh
series or take a look at the 1080 TI
well wait thank you for your donation
wishbone five dollars what do you think
of the IBM Power 10 next gen 2020 CPU I
am not familiar with it at all iBM is
making CPUs again I think I think
nothing of that because I don't know
that that exists that's really a thing
Howard 10 next-gen 20 Cal looked at it
fabien Carvajal Carvajal that's very
close to me Jana $5 donation no comments
Thank You Fabian for sending us money
and not making us say anything in return
about vaginas vagina the a3 MHB 10
Canadian dollars do you think a 550 watt
power supply will run to 10 80s an SLI
oh you guys by the way no no will not
you probably wants a 88 750 if it's a
nice if it's a very solid power supply I
would go for 850 850 because you always
want to have a little bit of a little
bit of breathing room but also you don't
want to be running like if you're
playing if you're gaming you don't be
running at like 80 or 90% of the power
supply's max wattage yeah you want some
cushion yeah yeah it's best to be more
in the some cushion 50 to 70% range ish
any any luck on that IBM power 10
next-gen 20 people to be happening IBM
unfolds power chip roadmap out past 2020
so currently when it would when it would
launch at x86 um yeah that's probably
yeah that's deeper into the charade
learn thank you for bringing that to our
attention that terrible baby and curve
agile again curvature Karva Chauth
horizontal $10 Paul II built my first PC
a few weeks ago thanks to you and your
channel
oh thank your thank you I'm glad that
makes me happy Fabian it's a 1600 X
system I would love to show you the
build and pictures if you're interested
been watching for a year now maybe and
if you wanted to show me a build in
pictures you should have included a link
to that with your donation but maybe try
to tweet at me that's probably the best
way I will keep an eye out if I don't
reply to you like wait a day and do it
again I don't like I try to keep up with
the tweets but they can offer me so so
many but yeah if you keep sending me
pictures of it I will see it eventually
I promise thank you thank you that and
Congrats on the bill robert f six
dollars and sixty six cents you evil
naughty boy not yet forty but getting my
annual check for cancer thankfully
nothing found over the years can only
potentially kill it early if you find it
early robert f nice what a sobering
comment i am also not yet forty and I
should get an annual check for cancer I
probably need them to stick a finger
into my butthole and check my prostate
at first I thought he meant he was
getting a check like a money check for
cancer they pay you I mean if you have a
answer that's I don't think that's how
it works but it would be at least some
small consolation you mean
they're physically checking him yeah
physically yeah the older you get as a
dude the more risk the more the more
uncomfortable and yet important the
doctor checkups we have their hands up
your bum if you're giving your prostate
chip check that's what is involved yes
yeah I mean I've never had anything
sticking my butt before why not
I mean I'd poop like every day then take
care of that uptight that feels fine
all right and ruch wire five Canady
Canadians shout-out to low global ah no
ll o VAR no assignment do a super small
threader per system and a massive Center
for system a second generator for Paul
did the mini system Kyle needs a elite
build successor I haven't seen any
thread Ripper board small smaller than
mini a micro micro AIDS yeah yeah and I
don't think they should be mini ITX or
it really doesn't make sense as where I
could do it micros fun as where I could
do a quad channel threader for board
they might try I mean why not
interesting but I'm game anyway thank
you Andrew the berserk Euler 555 should
I replace the two CPU fans with black
and gray fans or replace the three fans
to CPU rear with black and gray black
and red build I think you should do blue
and green he says it's a black and red
build I like you black and red I think
black and gray go with the black and
gray yeah because black and gray is a
nice complement to black and red given
the limited information that we have
that's my recommendation yeah black and
gray berserk Euler that's what you want
Jason
one two three four or twelve dollars and
thirty four cents hey do you guys know
if I can get cables for an older power
supply of an old Corsair each X 1,000
watt I want to use it in a dilapidated
Nast setup so I need more non broken
SATA connectors Wow
so Jason I think you have two options
here one would be to contact Corsair
directly to see if there's anything
that they can do if they have any old
cable kits that are available for it
second would be a little bit more
advanced so you need to be somewhat
confident using a a voltmeter if you
have a voltmeter you can you'll need a
voltmeter you'll need the actual ATX
pins the only 18 gauge cables and only
connectors and you can basically build
your own cables which is a very
time-consuming but also and some levels
a very satisfying thing to do but you
can actually use the voltmeter to check
which outputs because you've got you've
only got like a ground a 12 volts and a
5 volts pretty much for most of the
connectors on your modular cables maybe
a 3.3 volt 4 SATA connectors so yeah you
can put your own cables together yeah
that would be my recommendation I hope
that helps agrees everything possible
Frederick cow foot 50 DK Ches I don't I
figure that's a DK Kaiser Dix probably
worth lots of US dollars though hey it's
my name hi building a new PC and Lian Li
PC 0 11 D will it choke my W stealth
Wraith stealth
yeah I use 3 exhaust fans top 3 exhaust
side and 3 intake in the bottom then no
you have a crazy amount of airflow you
will not be choked at all you have lots
of airflow you're good good job
Frederick Calvert
thank you for your doughnut you Jason
Christoph $9.99 Paul regardless of your
sword financier aren't you sick of
testing only for Intel elastics ply
applies years Jason I'll be honest I'm
kind of torn when Intel was kind of
dominating and there wasn't much point
in and benchmarking AMD it did make
things slightly simpler like there
weren't as many work was easy test and
compare against each other that said I'd
much prefer there to be competition
amongst that and everything so I I'm
very happy with the stuff ambi is then
in the past year too bittersweet but
motions mean yeah I think it's good for
people who are using those products and
it's also good to provide more kick in
the pants towards Intel to
being competitive hopefully blue five
seven nine nine nine ten dollars says my
computer won't boot upgraded motherboard
CPU I used to have a used to have
Windows seven tried to install Windows
10 with USB media open CMD and cleaned
disc 0 and formatted to GPT now computer
won't boot with any with any of the or
SSD what I don't know does that mean I
don't I don't I don't know what computer
won't boot with me so blue like I would
recommend double-checking like if you
can access the UEFI are the BIOS maybe
try updating that sometimes older
versions of that might cause issues as
you go in through installation you
shouldn't if you're doing a Windows
installation and you're going into the
command the command prompt and doing
like like opening up disk part and doing
it clean on the disk you should just be
able to do the Windows 10 installation
on that disk and it shouldn't be doing
any like asking you to format a GPT or
anything like that so that's what's kind
of confusing me right there but yeah
sorry I'm still vetting entries for pit
myself okay so yeah I don't know if any
of those suggestions are helpful for you
it's hard to say without too much more
information but troubleshooting can
often be a bit of a bear if we're not
helping you here then I would recommend
finding some forums that you can go post
your comment on let's pry not very
helpful blue I hope you're able to like
I can't figure out how he's formatting
at GPT though it's just a terrible
advice giver polling lousy advice feel
bad
Jason Chris top $9.99 hey Paul my
roommate is up 400 because of AMD stuck
if their GPUs actually given video run
you can actually figure out the middle
ground between Intel Nvidia and that's
AMD stock price that's reasonable I
haven't seen anything from AMD side that
indicates
there they have an imminent GPU launch
that might be providing and video
injured with any competition right but
hey if they do I'll be excited weird
Congrats on your stock or at least your
roommates stock earnings who think next
$50 charity challenge you Greg Kyle Paul
Jay I will donate $2 per push-ups that
each of you do within 10 minutes time
frame to st. Jude Children's Hospital in
the name of the winner fifty dollars to
the winner posted end of August it will
be a really funny giveaway or a funny
donation charity charity funding thing I
just I'm not I'm very weak and weak and
like are we trying to raise as little
money as possible yeah for County
Hospital because if so that would be the
perfect way to do it
have a bunch of tech nerds do push-ups
and only race it's like that's like
raising money for like seeing how many
NFL players can like play PC games or or
build a computer you know in under 20
minutes
I would I would rather play video games
for charity cuz that's what we've done
in the past it's been reasonably
successful because we can actually do
that we're actually capable of playing
games at a reasonable shape I was I was
doing some push-ups here and there for a
while but I have it for the best bunt or
two
our minds are in good shape all our
marks alright one more done thank you
for saying X that's a crazy good
donation why would you do push-ups
you've already donated exactly the same
amount of money that you see if we watch
you suffer me I know right all right one
more donation to them we're gonna save
the rest of the donations for Kyle's
half the show Darrell may $5 tell
everyone about your giveaways you will
gain subs Thank You Darryl I'm always
torn about that on the one hand I like
to promote the giveaways on the other
hand I kind of like when there's only
like a more limited number of people
entering yeah cuz I feel like those the
people who are like really paying
attention and then they have a better
chance of actually winning so you're
sort of a you know it goes both ways but
guys that's all for my half of the show
awesome hardware episode 150
thank you so much for watching and
definitely hit the thumbs up button on
your way out if you have the chance and
