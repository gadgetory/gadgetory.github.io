you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master Jo's planes are you
supposed to be editing Joe we're here at
the thermaltake booth where Joe has just
killed power for the entire the entire
area
I guess well over there still working we
can we can talk about the stuff over
here so even though Joe has killed the
power to half of the room here at the
Thermaltake Suites we're still gonna
press on because we had got at least
half of the room working they're working
to turn the other half of the room back
on obviously everything third willtake
has is just far too powerful and the
Palazzo Venetian power grade was was
overwhelmed but let's move on
thermaltake is now doing memory so here
it is this is called the water ram RGB
so RGB memory fish pretty
straightforward Thermaltake is not just
putting RGB lighting on the memory
though they're actually producing the
memory sticks themselves there's a
couple of them over here they're a real
clean design so you've got the
water-cooled version right here that has
water blocks on top with 12 addressable
RGB LEDs beneath them then you have a
mounting plate right here and this is
also kind of uniquely designed because
different motherboards can have
different spacing for the DIMM slots and
this is a little bit adjustable so you
can actually install the memory and then
install the block on top you don't have
to install it all's as all as a single
unit and that means that for certain
motherboards like EVGA stim slots are
spaced a little bit differently
it'll still be compatible memory itself
looks really clean it's gets a aluminum
shroud on it and that does help with
heat dissipation they've made the top of
it very flat along there so we'll have
contact with the cold plate for the
memory cooling we're asking about actual
performance difference when you cool
your memory and thermal tag was very
honest about it they're not claiming
that this is going to suddenly give you
much faster speed but keeping your
components cooler can extend their
lifespan and as they get more of these
kits in they're gonna be doing more
testing so that they can be a little bit
more forthright in like what kind of
overclocking performance they're able to
get as well that said these are shipping
in 3200 speed kits cast latency 16 so
that's very fast as is currently
compatible with Intel platforms and I'm
going to be working with AMD to get
compatibility confirmed across that
platform as well now if you're not into
the RGB or the water cooling for your
memory then they are gonna be selling
these kits individually if you just
really like that kind of clean look for
the memory stick itself so keep an eye
out for that
future these kids themselves should be
available within the next month or two
now if you've already got memory but
it's crappy memory that doesn't have our
GB lighting on its thermaltake has you
covered with this specific r1 plus and
this is a little snap on a memory
lighting kit it can go over the top of
existing memory has again four LED
panels right there going across it so
you can add some RGB bling to your
existing memory without having to swap
it out or upgrade it so once again let's
see Pacific r1 plus already available
cost 50 watt $59.99 so check out the
Thermaltake website for that here's a
pretty epic build in the thermaltake for
p90 and I just I just wanted to share
this with you guys
thermal might put this build together
and he's got some really nice clean
bends going on here
these were aided by the thermal take
fittings that they have recently came
out with they actually came out with
these in 2018 Mike's actually got it
laid out right here so we're gonna take
a look the benefit of these fittings is
that the GM one-quarter part which is
right down there is flat on the top and
then there's a two-piece compression bit
that goes on top of that what that means
is you can line up your bends straight
across you don't have to lift them and
put them into a little cup holder or
something like that and that allowed
Mike to do bends like this little
loop-d-loop one right there so the way
Mike did this was he got the insert the
silicone insert cut it to the exact
length that he wanted for the
loop-d-loop
took that out put it inside the actual
ptg this is a PU tube heated up the
whole tube except for the very ends and
then he actually had the fitting
installed in there so he could go and
place it exactly where it needed to be
do the bend
put it on there he had the compression
fittings on the ends too so he could
secure that so he actually kind of
finalized this Bend and finessed it into
place while it was connected up there so
that means that you're gonna know that
your fittings are gonna match up with
your tube bends and that's that's just a
breakthrough for this type of water
cooling so very well done Thermal take
those fittings are called the C pros and
they're available now also while we're
here we have the thermal take tough
power pf1 argb it's a 1200 watt digital
power supply so you can get digital
control and monitor all of your rails
and everything like that and of course
it's our GP as well so whether you want
RGB bling or you know you can also make
it all whites like this here's the level
20 RGB mechanical gaming keyboard this
is the flagship keyboard at a level 20
RGB is available in a few different
flavors interestingly enough Thermaltake
has teamed up with razors so they offer
razor switches you can get in
green switches which is the most
cost-effective version you can get that
for 120 bucks or it's available with
Cherry MX
silver or blue switches and those are a
hundred and fifty or hundred and sixty
bucks this keyboard has a bit wider
stance so it's got plenty of frame going
around the outside but he also get an
RGB accent light or on the edge and then
you also get some media controls up at
the top here as well as functional
buttons for doing stuff like adjusting
the lighting and turning off the windows
but then here's the Razer Neptune Pro
this is available with blue or red
switches although they are not cherry
this is gonna be again a more
cost-effective option but a mechanical
keyboard so you can get this for a $70
$69.99 you get the mechanical switches
they have a clicky feel if you get the
Reds they wouldn't be as quickie but
even though this is less expensive it is
by no means a minimal keyboard you still
get media controls up here you get a
wrist dress down here at the bottom and
you get these controls for lighting and
the windows key as well at the top
lastly up here in the top left you've
got the game mode button so you can
punch that to switch between different
gaming modes so you can set it up for
applications using the Thermaltake
software to rearrange your macro keys or
what have you and that will allow you to
easily switch between those and back to
some more liquid cooling stuff these
down here feature new colors new thermal
tech colors cool antenna liquid cooling
loop can be very challenging especially
if you want to make it's colorful that
is why I often just run with distilled
water in my cooling loops however there
are plenty of products out there that
claim to give you an opaque solid color
or even tinted fluid and they can often
lead to build up over time
Thermal take is developing this t1000
coolant in order to allow you to do
those colors without the build-up these
are the bottles for the transparent
available an acid green red purple blue
and green and then they've also got a
pastel coolant the colors for that
include blue white yellow red and green
and if you want to know what it looks
like Mike's build over here is rocking
that pastel white cords and lastly I
wanted to give you guys a look at this
case right here this is a special
version of the level 20 tempered glass
edition of course I've showed in this
case before they had it at Computex it
is an epic massive case with multiple
chambers really really well suited for
water cooling as you can see with the
system they have installed right here
and they've given it a bit of bling by
adding this special paint job this is
Miami blue or so I am told which is
based on a color from a very fancy
sports car
also might notice it has a very clean
and smooth finish here as opposed to a
lot of other thermal take cases that add
a bit of texture to them so you get sort
of a more shiny feel thermaltake is
considering doing some special edition
limited runs of these cases with special
paint jobs like this so let me know in
the comments section down below if you'd
be interested in a super high-end level
20 case from the thermal tape but that's
all the time I have for today this has
been the thermal take sweets from CES
2019 thank you guys so much for watching
hit the thumbs up button and of course a
big final thank you to my sponsors for
CES 2918 deep cool Coolermaster Corsair
and internets thanks again for watching
guys we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
