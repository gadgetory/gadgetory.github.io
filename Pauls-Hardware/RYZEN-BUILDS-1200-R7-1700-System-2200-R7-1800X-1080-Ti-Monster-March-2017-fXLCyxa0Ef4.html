here to tell you all that Rison sucks
AMD sucks Scott Watson is a jerk no one
should buy any AMD products ever Vegas
probably going to suck okay hello
yeah no the the agreement was three
wheelbarrows full cash three I'm so
that's not that's not going to cut it
okay look I don't play hardball here but
I just wanna let you know that you're
leaving me little choice but to
basically use my online influence and
reach which is substantial by the way
it's not insignificant to pretty much
destroy your brand and your reputation I
understand also I will have you on the
phone I was wondering about those opt-in
samples you hello hello well I suppose
that sort of changes the tone of today's
video why don't we go ahead and just do
March builds since that's what I usually
do at the beginning of every month I
list out a couple builds part lists so
if you're building a system yourself or
you just need some help getting the list
together want to stepping off point you
can use these to go by and if you're
looking for an actual assembly of a
system don't worry I do those as well
and I have quite a few of those just
recently so check that my builds
playlists for that also I ask you guys a
question every month so that I can base
next month builds on your feedback so
here is the question for next month what
bills do you want to see in April 1080i
Vega based or maybe rising three Rison
five all of those I have no idea when
they might actually launch but if
they're out by then then maybe we can do
builds sort of based around those also
you guys voted for this month and of
course I didn't give you too many
options besides Rison and of course
Rison one oh my god oh my god Rhys and
so let's let's just dive right into it
start off with my over-the-top build is
based on an 1800 X and I have paired it
in theory with a GTX 1080 TI which was
just announced by Nvidia now these
aren't available for sale yet we can't
even tell you when they're available for
sale but we can tell you that they'll be
available soon and we do know that they
cost seven seven hundred dollars and
that is supposed to be 35% faster than a
GTX 1080 so all that said let's let's
pair it up with the risin seven 1800 X
and I'm sure there's going to be actual
benchmarks that come out one
the the 1080 TI is available with gaming
performance and whatnot but I'm really
not diving into rising gaming
performance in this video because the
Lord knows that's been a bit of a
quagmire and I hope I have been faring
my assessment of it so far we're all
hoping that it improves I guess I'll
leave it that anyway though 1800 X is
about 500 bucks I paired it with the
liquid cooler since you can get improved
clock speeds by just a tad at least by
going with the liquid cooler h 100 is
listed as an incompatibility item on
this list but that is because the h1
hundred I has am four brackets available
you got a contact corsair directly for
them or if you do like I did and use
with it use it with the Asus crosshair 6
hero motherboard and I did that in my
most recent rise in video which was
overclocking you can kind of see a
little bit of that here you do need an
AM three back plates if you're going to
use the m3 mount with h100 IV to those
so bear that in mind you would need to
scrounge up the name through backplate
or probably do the smart thing and just
hit up Corsair directly if you want to
use their liquid cooler but I feel like
I'm getting ahead of myself
first off there's the 1800 X available
for $498 and 19 super business by super
Buy bead super B's has it for $1 off
screaming deal then of course the H 100
IV - I like this cooler I think it looks
good I like this leaving on the tubing
and whatnot also a good performer and
the crosshair 6 hero which is on the
higher end when it comes to the am 4
boards that are currently available this
one cost about 250 to 260 dollars
although it is a very solid boards got
your RGB lighting effects and everything
looks really cool I really like what
they've done like with the accents on
the vrm cooling and and that kind of
thing it's a nice board and it's pretty
stable for me in my overclocking test
plenty of SATA connectivity it's even
got that USB 3.1 header that Asus has
sort of developed and since there is no
USB 3.1 header officially right now
although you do need a special case I
think in win has cases right now and
there might be one or two other places
has them as well for memory we have a 32
gig kits one of a chief skill Ripjaws 5
here like look at this memory pretty
sweet it's a very small picture of it
but you get the general idea
and what ddr4 3,200 I was having a
bility I was getting pretty decent
stability with 90s
29:33 speed memory and that was working
with the ddr4 3000 kit that I had in my
testing I think 3200 you should be just
fine getting stable of course we're
waiting for some luck efi updates for
the motherboards and that kind of thing
which are promising to add increased
stability as well as the platform itself
develops and you know gets better
updates and all that good stuff anyway I
wanted a big and pretty fast SSD so what
they go CZ try on 960 this is a 960
gigabyte version i basically was
comparing several of the 1 terabyte SSDs
that are out there they're all around
the $250 price right now you can also
get like a sand disc that's right in
there or the a data SP 550 all right
right around the same price and roughly
equivalent performance and then of
course we got the 1080 TI which again
just announced by Nvidia still doesn't
have reviews out on it yet the I believe
the unboxing embargo for this listed
this morning so we had some unboxing
videos that went out and again 700 bucks
but we can with a reasonable degree of
certainty assume this will be the
fastest GPU when it launches assuming of
course that AMD doesn't come out with
something Vega based like right in here
of an interim and just given Nvidia
sucker punch shape that's probably not
gonna happen
finally for our case we have the NZXT
s340 a case I have worked with before
very nice case looks cool solid design
with the red and black version because
you know it's an AMD build and some red
accents in there and I take it will
match up also only about 65 to 70
dollars depending where you get it which
i think is a very good price finally we
need a power supply went with the
coarser our MX 750 watch my requirements
for this or basically I wanted a little
bit higher than average wattage 700 to
800 was what I was looking at 80 plus
gold fully modular and I wanted cables
that didn't look like at and this
particular power supply fits the bill
slightly more expensive comes in a
little bit over a hundred dollars one
hundred two hundred and ten bucks but
very good power supply from Corsair and
I think anyone who gets it will be happy
with it probably be able to use it's
quite some time to they saw the power
supply will ask you for many many builds
all right that's all for the first
builds that's one to two hundred dollars
so it's pretty expensive in fact getting
up into the range where you might say
there's some actually more legitimate
direct Intel competition but I think
actually that is the strong points of
the rise and CPUs that have launched so
far otherwise in seven ones is they
really are
like right up there in performance when
it comes to workstation tasks and and
you know they're not too far behind in
gaming either especially when you
compare it to like Broadwell East stuff
from Intel so you're going to get an 8
core 16 thread processor in this build
for significantly less than what you
would pay for if you were going for like
a 69 hundred K of course now the
flipside and I think one of the best
pieces of competition for the rise in r7
1800 X is the rise in r7 1700 and if you
checked out my overclocking video you
might understand why the overclocking
performance of the 1700 is right in line
with what you would get with a 1700 X or
1800 X it's based on the same die and
it's basically got the same specs all
around except for the clock speed TDP as
well but if you're overclocking then
you're probably smashing through the TDP
recommendation numbers for that anyway
so all that said I have actually put
together two rise in 1700 builds here
it's what I'm going to go over first is
$1400 and this should be the build that
I actually build this month and if you
guys don't believe me because I haven't
built February's build yet
trust me the February build was still
coming I actually have all the parts for
it now and I'll be doing that soon but
here's a $1400 rise in 1700 build with
the gtx 1070 and i did make some
accommodations for some cooler master
parts in here because i will be using
their case and i should also be using
that cooler in their power supply but to
follow up if you're not as concerned
about seaming everything and you are ok
with swapping out a couple parts here
and maybe having slightly less
performance and slightly less SSD space
then you can do this build which is
$1,200 and really not too far off but
let's go over the parts that I chose
first off which is the Rison 7 1700 of
course 330 dollars I think this is going
to be the current champ when it comes to
the rise in series because it's a
hundred and seventy dollars cheaper than
the 1800 X and again you can get roughly
equivalent performance if you're willing
to put a decent cooler on it and do some
overclocking I have not done air-cool
testing with 1700 yet so it still
remains to be seen just how how far you
can overclock it and how stable you can
get that with air cooling but I think
the master air pro here from
Coolermaster would be able to do a fine
job for that this is sort of their
updated new series since
master Eyre series he's just launched I
think within the past month or two
they've got like a black plate over the
top to make them look a bit cleaner than
like the hyper 212 Evo the hyper 212 we
kind of fell out of love with just
simply because there were some other
coolers from my cryo rig and enter max
that we felt like where they just looked
a little bit more appealing and if you
have a big side panel one day you want
to make sure sure things look pretty
nice we can get this one for 40 bucks
from new eggs very good price and
there's a $10 million rebate to get that
even cheaper and this also comes an for
compatible out-of-the-box so that was
also a significant impact from the
motherboard I have the xb-70 Taichi and
if you're wondering why maybe you look
over my left shoulder and you'll know
why I'm building with this board because
I have it also it's got a nice feature
set as far as what it comes with out of
the box from asrock and see if we can
check the new egg product page on this
it is al it's a 200 bucks so it's less
than the crosshair six does have a
$15.00 mail and rebate at least if you
buy it from newing right now so you get
for 185 it's out of stock but they
should be getting more in tomorrow cool
looking board and again a nice set of
features really good power delivery on
this at least from what I can tell again
I haven't tested this independently but
I mean look at all those faces how could
you go wrong with all those prior faces
also it's got a couple MDOT two slots
it's got support for USB 3.1 and asrock
has been sending even though I haven't
used this board yet they've been sending
me BIOS updates so they have been
diligently working on getting their BIOS
their EFI firmware up-to-date and
everything
Sonya pairing with that I went to
Corsair Vengeance lpx this is the same
ddr4 3000 kit that I had been using in
my testing simply because it's one of
the few kits that have been validated
and I was hitting 29:33 very stable e
with all of my chips with this kit 16
gigs also via to a cake sticks gives you
two extra slots on the motherboard to
upgrade in the future if you want more
memory I like a 480 gig 500 gig ish SSD
for your main operating system drive
they do cost as the prices crept up it's
gone up by a good 10 or 20 bucks since
the beginning of the year but still four
hundred and thirty dollars or so you
have enough space for your operating
system and a decent number of games and
apps and I'm assuming of course that
you're going
be also dropping in like an old
mechanical drive company on two terabyte
drive or something on top of that so you
have a bit of extra storage for the
graphics card actually did one of those
parametric filters that PC part picker
has and it actually changed from when I
set this these builds up this morning to
right now the lowest price 1080 right
now is the gtx 1070 the gigabyte many
one that's $379 and jet there was a
ZOTAC one earlier today for 350 bucks
but that deal must have ended or
something like that but anyway so 380
bucks for a gtx 1070 to pair with that
and that's about the price range you
should be looking at the match cage pro
5 is the case i have chosen this is a
very good case i have worked with this
case i'm not going to be building in
this case i'm going to be building with
the pro 6 because i have that right now
but that's a very new case so I just put
the pro 5 on there the pro 6 actually
might cost 10 or 20 bucks more and maybe
40 bucks I don't know the price directly
right now but you know go with this one
instead it's got the same basic frame it
doesn't have the pop-out panels like the
like the pro 6s but a really really
solid construction that's what I always
liked about the cooler master cases
they're built like freaking tanks and
then we got a cooler match power supply
on there 260 650 watt 80 plus gold fully
modular ATX power supply about a hundred
bucks for this so again not too much
cheaper than like the 750 watt Corsair
units that I used I wasn't able to find
super good pricing for the cooler master
power supplies there are some other
options from some other vendors that are
out there right now but this one does
have good cabling it's all black and
it's fully modular and I assume there
might be a picture of the cables in here
somewhere
look at that fan 2 fans nice ohm look
there's a shot at the inside not much
pictures of the cables but it's all
black trust me so there's my horizon 7
1700 build and I ready I wanted to
originally say compare this to the $1200
build that I did towards the end of last
year which is a $1200 build with a 7600
K or 6600 K and a gtx 1070 here you're
going to get way way more raw cpu
compute performance with a 1700 and you
can get the same build I wanted to say
you can get the same build for also
$1200 but where did where did my entire
build let's go there it is for $1200
this actually turned out to be $1400 it
was actually 1,400 even until I lost my
deal on the on the graphics card and
that went up by 30 bucks but you guys
get the point but I also wanted to ask
myself could I do this build essentially
for $1200 so that's my sort of third
bonus build that I'm doing today which
is all roughly the same parts but just a
couple things swapped out so here it is
my $1200 version of the March 2017
Verizon 1700 builds with the gtx 1070
again the compatibility issues that are
listing here just because these coolers
have not been updated with a m4
compatibility
i use the hyper 212 evo on this one
which is a $30 process or $30 cooler can
get it even cheaper than that sometimes
but coolermaster will provide you an
updated a m4 bracket if you need it for
for this if you don't get the I'm sure
they're going to update the actual
packaging that has a in for support and
whatnot but they have confirmed it is
supported but you do have to contact
cooler master to get the bracket okay so
there's cooler hyper typical vivo you
guys you guys familiar with that one for
the motherboard itself with the asrock X
370 killer SLI so it's still actually 70
so you still have SLI support slightly
lower end board from asrock so the
feature sets not quite going to be all
there it is still got an decent color
scheme though black and whites big okay
across the mill because because you know
that's useful and 135 dollars at least
after rebate right now so I'm you're
shaving a good 60 ish dollars off the
price compared to the the Taichi so
saving about ten to twenty dollars with
the cooler saving another fifty five ish
dollars with the motherboard the memory
kit is the same the SSD is not the same
it's a 240 AF SSD Syrian I can have as
much space here but that cuts off
another $50 on the price same gtx 1070
via the filter and then with a slightly
cooler case that's only about 15 or 20
bucks cheaper but the corsair 200 are
solid case good performer not very
blingy but gets the job done and then
for a power supply the see sonic s 12 to
6 20 watt
again not blingy not good cables cables
but if you don't have a side panel
window it really doesn't matter and it's
a see sonic 80 plus bronze again it'll
get the job done and it's only about $49
right
so there you go guys those are my two
plus I guess three builds that I have
done for horizon I totally recommend
that 17-hundred build over the 1800 x
build it's just a lot more practical and
I think the 1700 is really the way to go
right now
1700 overclock it get your get all your
cores up to three point seven to three
point eight which I think just about
anybody can do with a really basic bit
of overclocking and you'll have a really
powerful system not just for gaming but
also for gaming and streaming or for
doing workstation tasks or doing video
editing or doing video and coding really
good for all those things so there you
have it guys let me know we think these
builds down in the comment section below
I always welcome you guys to post your
own builds down there to PC part picker
is a great site for doing that so check
it out use their filters they're up
there doing tons of updates right now to
get all the am4 stuff listed on the
sites and proper compatibility and all
that stuff and links to all the stuffs
also is down in the video description so
thanks for watching and we'll see you
