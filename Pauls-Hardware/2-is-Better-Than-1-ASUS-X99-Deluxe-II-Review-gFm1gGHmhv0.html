you know Kyle's full of oh well I
was in our soup and pulse still Nigeria
we've been here for like an hour
dudes get the hell outta here excellent
what's up guys welcome back here's my
long-awaited review of the Asus x99
deluxe 2 motherboard Asus recently
refreshed their x99 lineup to correspond
with the launch of Intel's new
enthusiast CPUs the Broadwell II ones
that launched back at the beginning of
June 2016 you can check out my 69 50 X
benchmarks if you have a card right up
there older but still very powerful
haswell-e CPUs are also supported of
course as the sport continues to use the
LGA 2011 - 3 sockets and x99 chipset
round things out with a redesigned black
white and grey color scheme throwing
some optional RGB lighting at a generous
stack of accessories in the box and the
$420 price tag starts to sound almost
reasonable so clearly at $420 this is a
high-end board and since the CPUs that
work with it start at around $400
themselves it is safe to say that this
board is for enthusiasts who are looking
for more than just a gaming rig that
price does at least get you tons of
accessories which was my complaint
actually with the Maximus 8 formula from
Asus that I reviewed a few months back
card up in the corner which also had a
premium price tag but I felt was short
on add-ons with the x99 deluxe - you get
a two black-and-whites SATA cables half
of them with 90 degree angled connectors
on one end an RGB LED extension cable
just one ribbon style 2-way or 3-way SLI
bridge not the prettiest in my opinion
and would like to have seen a basic
2-way bridge as well or maybe one of
those black ROG ones there's also a
Thunderbolt cable to connect the
Thunderbolt cards to the Thunderbolt
header on the motherboard a mini
DisplayPort to DisplayPort cable for
writing your GPUs video out into the
Thunderbolt card
can then be fed back out through the USB
type-c port a silver and blue IO shield
with squishy ESD backing a stack of
documentation for the fan extension card
the hyper m2 card Quick Start Guide
optical driver and software CDs I guess
people still use these maybe as well as
booklets for the Thunderbolt II x3 card
and the actual motherboard itself but
wait there's more a couple small kits
for CPU installation and vertical m2
card installation three temperature
sensor cables with diodes you can place
wherever you want in your system a
magnetic base antenna for the built-in
dual band 802 dot eleven AC Wi-Fi if an
extension cables connect the fan
extension card q connector for more
easily connecting front panel leads
screws formatting m dot two and fan
extension cards the hyper M two by four
mini card for adding another m2 slot to
your system on top of the built-in one
the thunderbolt the x3 card which gives
you a really nice add-on and Thunderbolt
connectivity bi-directional connection
speeds up to 40 gigabits per second as
well as two additional USB 3.1 ports and
type a and type C trim finally the fan
extension card that allows you to
connect three more fans for a maximum of
nine two CPU fans and seven case fans
each with independent control from
either the UEFI bios or the AI suite 3
software wow that's a lot of accessories
what about the motherboard itself though
the Asus x99 deluxe 2 is heavy first of
all which is usually an indicator of
good build quality and higher bill of
materials cost for example uses
integrated some massive vrm heat sinks
and a dense multi-layer PCB with a clean
matte black finish speaking of the
finish black white and grey or silver is
the color scheme here with just the
slightest hint of blue on some of the
flair pieces and heatsink covers for
memory support you have eight DIMM slots
for quad channel ddr4 up to 16 gigs per
dim slot for up to 128 gigs total at
asu's is validated kits going up to 33
33 speed this is continuing to use their
OC socket design which has extra pins in
the 2011 - 3 socket which they say helps
combat voltage drop for more stable
overclocking the PCIe slot uses the new
safe slot steel-reinforced
implementation which JJ told me last
month integrates into the mother word
PCB for increased sturdiness less flex
with heavy GPUs installed there's five
full-length PCI Express by 16 slots and
one by one slot but bear in mind that
the second full-length slot the one
without the steel reinforcement or the
led
on the retention mechanism is a Gentoo
by for connection x99 deluxe to
officially supports 3-way SLI or
crossfire configurations if you're using
a 40 PCIe line CPU like a 69 50 X or 59
30 K incidentally in my build here I am
using a 59 30 K even with a 40 PCIe Lane
CPU there are still some connectivity
limitations since there is no PL X which
to provide more lanes more on that
though when I move on to storage so if
your fan support you get six total
headers on the board all of them 4-pin
with auto detection of PWM or DC voltage
control there's two CPU fan connectors
up above the CPU socket two more along
the right near the SATA ports for system
fans then two more along the left just
above the PCI Express the left header
here provides up to three amps for high
speed high current fans and the right
one is a pump header tuned for DC or PWM
water cooling pumps there are also seven
temperature sensors scattered throughout
the board all software accessible and of
course the fan extension header lets you
add three more fans and three more
temperature sensors via that accessory
along the bottom of the board starting
from the lower right you've got front
panel connectors an XMP switch to force
your memory to use XMP mode a CPU over
voltage header to increase the voltage
values available for overclocking and
SLI and crossfire switch to more easily
configure two-way in three way GPU
setups this will also light up the
corresponding PCIe slots with their LEDs
to tell you which slot to install your
GPUs do that's kind of nice the
thunderbolt header for the add-in card a
USB 2.0 and a couple USB 3.0 headers and
RGB header to connect compatible RGB LED
strips and like I have setup right here
in front of me trusted platform module
header fan extension header and q code
button and a debug LED which is great
for troubleshooting boot problems
surface mounted power and reset buttons
thanks for not forgetting those by the
way Asus and finally s/pdif and front
panel audio headers storage options are
plentiful on this board there's a couple
you two connectors for PCIe SSD s like
the Intel 750 series and the single
vertical key mm2 slot next to the 24-pin
power supporting up to 80 millimeter
length SSDs vertical orientation means
it takes up less board real estate and
your m2 SSD will stay cooler
you also get 10 a total SATA rev three
ports one through six have raid support
four through eight have SATA Express
option and nine and ten are just normal
SATA ports just tucked away under the
x99
chipset heatsink you can of course add
another MDOT to via the accessory riser
card going back to the PCIe lanes and
connectivity though remember that just
because all these ports and slots exist
doesn't mean you can use them all at the
same time the manual elucidates the
situation a little bit less Tang which
connections share bandwidth mainly via
the PCI Express slots of sharing
bandwidth with either the u2 and Batou
or USB 3.1 connections for most people
this won't be an issue but double check
these conflicts if you really were
planning for a three-way GPU set up with
a couple you two drives nnm to you
probably can't do all that at the same
time moving up the right side of the
board we have a closer look at the
aforementioned u2 and vertical MDOT two
connectors 24-pin main power connection
and the asus memo pad button which is
great for troubleshooting memory
problems for power delivery around the
CPU socket you have an eight phase--
design with premium quality MOSFETs
chokes and caps and of course those two
large dedicated heat sinks and a heat
pipe connecting them with the second one
kind of tucked into the i/o panel to get
some of that heat out towards the rear
of the system supplemental CPU power is
delivered via eight pin and four pin
connectors at the top of the board next
ninety nine deluxe features crystal
sound three audio not quite as high end
as rog boards since it uses a more
standard Realtek ALC 1150 codec chip
asus has made sure to give it the best
conditions possible though with Japanese
made audio capacitors a power pre
regulator and audio amplifier and a pop
filter circuit crystal sound three
supports eight channel surround and the
components are EMI shielded with a PCB
separation layer to minimize
interference on the rear panel IO on the
left is a BIOS reset button that can
also be used for the USB BIOS flashback
features still one of my favorite Asus
features in last five or ten years
there's two Intel gigabit NICs wired in
with the Asus LAN guard to resist static
discharge and power surges for USB 3.0
ports with fast charge four USB 2.0
ports for more USB 3.1 ports one of them
with a type-c connector 3x3 antenna
connectors for the 13 megabits per
second 802 that 11 AC dual band Wi-Fi
and finally the gold plated audio
connections 8-inch jacks for mic in a
channel surround out or an optical
Toslink s/pdif connection ok next up
we're going to take a quick tour of the
asus UEFI and then we'll wrap up with an
aura
RGB LED demo so here's the ACS UEFI BIOS
and it's an easy mode right now this is
the default gives you a quick look at
what BIOS for
you have CPU installed memory installed
that kind of things CPU voltage
temperature easy system tuning is over
here so you can switch between some
presets for normal quiet performance
energy-saving boot priorities here you
can drag and drop to move stuff around
you can actually pull up a whole boot
menu as well
what SATA devices are connected DRAM
status and XMP and your fan profile down
here I have some access to some pretty
useful stuff here like cue fan control
you can actually select any of the fans
in your system and set up a custom fan
curve for them which is pretty
convenient also of course you still have
Advanced Mode so if you hit f7 we can go
over that in advanced mode is probably
gonna be a little bit more familiar for
you guys who've done a lot of
overclocking and stuff in the past you
can set up a favourites area where you
can sort of pin things that you go to
frequently if the easy mode isn't good
enough for you your main option ai
Tweaker here is where you do all of your
overclocking stuff by core and of course
you have all the low level access to
stuff such as DRAM time timing and digi+
power control and CPU power management
tweakers paradise all the really
low-level things that I'm too scared to
actually mess with myself now you might
notice here that I have a four point
four gigahertz overclock that's been
enabled here actually did that with the
five way optimization with the Asus
software more on that in just a second
anyway here's advanced configurations
for PCH and CPU and all that good stuff
monitoring things such as CPU
temperature and you can actually adjust
those all individually or monitor them
here boot of course you can switch
fastboot mode or those different things
and then you've you have the tools over
here I wanted to show the easy flash 3
utility which will lets you update the
BIOS now has easy simple access so you
can update straight from the internet
rather than downloading your BIOS and
putting it on a flash drive for example
and then you also have secure erase
function in here which is great for
wiping an SSD and putting it back and
kind of factory defaults situate factory
default settings which is nice for an
SSD that you might have found is slowing
down and great to be able to do it here
right from the UEFI back to that
overclock though I always like to run
Asus 5 way optimization when I get one
of these boards just to throw in a chip
and see what happens
it starts off with the automatic
overclocking or Auto tuning it runs some
automatic stress tests on the CPU and
just ramps up the frequency until it
gets to a point where cheeves
instability
for this was my 59 30k got to 4.4
gigahertz running it at one point two
seven five volts which is a very nice
straightforward good overclock that most
people would be happy with and I got it
with a single click
it also runs through the rest of the
five way optimization so TPU fan expert
3 is next so it reaches out tests all
the fans in your system gets their min
and Max values and sets them to a
reasonable fan curve for quiet quietness
as well as you know performance EPU and
DIGI+ power control are also power
savings features for the full whole
system as well as for the digital
digital power delivery specifically for
the CPU and here's a demo of the asus or
RGB lighting and since I know RGB LED
lighting it's not for everyone look
there's an off switch
they all just turned off isn't that nice
do note that the debug LED and the power
resets LEDs do stay on even though the
RGB LEDs are turned off and am i turning
the back on you might notice that
there's four different distinct areas
here so let me switch over to static
audio PCIe PCH and LED strip so the
audio is actually this bit right over
here the crystal sound which I'm
hopefully pointing to with my knife yes
crystal sound right there there's also
the PCI Express slot
snaps or that kind of catches that light
up four of those do right there you can
see the lower three right now the top
one is currently blocked by the graphics
card there's also lighting just above
the chipset which is probably the
hardest to see here but it would
illuminate kind of the area just above
the chipset again kind of blocked by the
graphics card right now but then you
might also notice that I have an LED
strip plugged in down here this is a
cable mod RGB LED strip and it is
specifically sent to me or was
specifically sent to me for the Maximus
8 formula video however I did notice
that the RGB is not in the proper
orientation so you might notice when I'm
set to static if I switch to say green
for example whereas the lights on the
motherboard are kind of green or they
should be right green oh I'm only
controlling the LED strip let's
synchronize yeah he's a good nice okay
with everything synchronized you notice
if I switch to green the motherboard
LEDs are green but the LED strip below
is blue so you can do red fine because
the Reds are right look everything's
kind of red we're ready
pink or something in that area however
blue and green are switched you could
fix this by either swapping getting the
the connector cable and swapping the
lead or Asus could put back the
calibration function that was there for
RGB with the original Ora software I
don't know where it went
maybe I just couldn't find it it was
hidden originally but anyway so right
now we can see mainboard at the top
because that is what I currently have
installed if you had a graphics card it
would also show up here you have
settings for startup and shutdown
so there are LEDs that are on while the
system is shutdown but you can control
that function here just as was the
startup you have of course the features
that you would expect such as static and
breathing these are what are very common
when it comes to RGB LEDs in general now
but I am happy to say that there are
some other options here strobing I've
never found to be all that useful
strobing and double strobing that seems
to be popular but color cycle is useful
especially if you're using the add-on
RGB LED strip because then it's cycling
through colors and you can't tell them
that they're the crane and the bluer
wear swaps rainbow of course is also an
option here and that will sort of cycle
through a bunch of rainbows you might
notice here you also control over the
speed and then there's also direction
direction comes in with some of these
other effects they've implemented I
really kind of like comment so comment
will kind of cycle through you can see
it kind of crossing over and you can
switch downstream or upstream so that
just kind of switches the direction that
it goes in back and forth so you can see
how if you had this installed in a case
you could actually get a pretty cool
effect you can also cycle cycle back and
forth so go one way and then the other
and then of course you can control the
speed here as well this is going to
synchronize automatically because it's
Rainbow Comet flash and - I also thought
was kind of fun it controls the actual
intensity of lighting so you kind of a
flash as it cycles through the different
things those another so a couple really
cool effects that I think Asus is
implemented here that actually found
useful as opposed to just the regular
static and breathing of course you can
get some more practical stuff like CPU
temperature to turn that one on and it
will change the color based on the
temperature of your CPU and then if you
have music going on you can switch to
music effect and the lighting will
strobe along with the music as it plays
in your system so in conclusion the
things I like about this motherboard
our that it is a significantly updated
version of the x99 deluxe that I've been
using an arctic panther back there for
over a year now more m2 u2 and USB 3.1
and type-c are very welcome on this
platform
five-way optimization with automatic
overclocking works great and the board
has all the features you could want
within reason the accessory package as
well is very nice also the LED lighting
I know it's not for everyone but it's
integrated well and the aura software
has come a long way even just since my
Maximus aid formula video that I did a
couple months back it's nice to see some
built-in effects other than static or
breathing that I might actually want to
use and the synchronization works very
well as for cons I would say it's
expensive but honestly with the added
accessories it's not that bad compared
to some of the highest-end x99 boards
out there I've mentioned the limitations
with connectivity if you really want to
max the board out so a PL X chip to add
PCIe lanes would definitely have been
cool but I think that probably would've
driven the price up to the $500 plus
range so to sum up this is a beautiful
feature packed and well designed
motherboard and I think any enthusiast
who's dropping a couple grand on a
Broadwell e workstation and gaming build
will be very happy with it links to this
motherboard on Amazon as well as my
Paul's hardware store you can buy shirts
and other stuff like it are down in the
