people ask me all the time hey Paul how
can I build the fastest computer
possible and I tell them well this is
sorry this is how you build the fastest
computer possible with one GPU for now
the thermaltake view 71 snow edition
shows off your building style with a
frosty white paint job and four tempered
glass side panels you also get two
pre-installed hundred and forty
millimeter ring white LED fans a
vertical GPU met with bracket and 3-way
radiator support for water cooling so
click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more now this is a
complete build and this is based on my
monthly build series which I just posted
last week so check it out if you want to
see this build plus a $450 system but
there's really two main components here
that make this the fastest computer
possible the first is the new and video
geforce r-tx 2080 TI and i can even talk
about performance on this card yet but i
can safely assume that the 20 80 TI is
gonna be faster than the 1080 TI which
was formerly the fastest single GPU
within reason that's not a Titan that
you can buy for a gaming PC now again I
don't know what the actual performance
of the 20 80 TI is quite yet so it's
possible that people could come in here
and say be like oh you should put a
Titan V in there something like that
that would actually be faster we'll know
more next week so stay tuned for more
upcoming content on my channel where I
will actually hopefully be testing that
and showing some performance numbers the
second part that is the key component
for making this the fastest computer
possible for gaming is the i7 8700 K
right down here this is a 6 core 12
thread processor the only way you could
get a little bit faster than the 8700 K
would be good to go with the 8086 k
that's essentially the same exact
processor just ships at a higher
frequency so if you can overclock your
87 or 2k to the same frequency as an 80
86 k then they will behave the same in
either case though it's the fastest
processor for gaming it's got the best
single core performance so the fastest
gaming PC possible right now is going to
be that processor paired with this GPU
and then overclocking each one as much
as you possibly can to that end we have
a master liquid ML 240 our RGB
all-in-one liquid cooler here so look
what Colleen is going to be our best bet
for
CPU to give us some overclocking
Headroom you would also want a decent
motherboard with decent power delivery
and overclocking options I've got the
Asus prime Z 370 - a here I actually
recommended a gigabyte motherboard in
the builds video they're both in the
same ballpark when it comes to price and
features I simply use this one because I
have it on hand it should match with the
color scheme as well which is always
nice but that's pretty much it the
processor overclocked the GPU
overclocked everything else is just sort
of choose-your-own-adventure for what
parts you think will fit in there and
look the best again for the case in the
setup video I chose a different one than
this this is a li lian li 0 11 dynamic
I'm building this one because it's the
white version and it's my first chance
to try it out it's cost a little over
$100 I was recommending about a hundred
bucks to spend on the case for a system
in this range and if you're wondering
the total cost of all these parts or at
least the parts it shows in the initial
build setup video it's about $2,400
rounding things out we've got the EVGA
supernova 750 g3 you can get away with
the 650 watt power supply if you want to
save a little bit of cash but I do
recommend 80 plus gold you could also
get away with 80 plus bronze but this is
a higher-end system so I thought going
with the higher end power supply it
would be a reasonable choice for storage
I actually have two drives so for an
operating system drive and for fast
loading of games and software we have
the Samsung 970 Evo in the build video I
actually recommended the 960 evil which
you can get for a little bit cheaper
than this again I'm going with this one
because I have it on hand but the 960
Evo will work just the same and pretty
much just as well - and then I'm
recommending dropping in a one terabyte
SSD because you can find them for pretty
cheap these days around a hundred and
fifty dollars or so this is a SanDisk
Ultra to 960 gig but pick your poison
when it comes to one terabyte SSDs
there's quite a few options right now
that's gonna give us a lot more fast
storage for our steam drive and getting
all of our Steam games
loaded up so we can play them at a
moment's notice and finally for memory I
just have a simple g.skill ripjaws 5 kit
here this is not RGB it's just a 2 by 16
gig kit and it's ddr4 3200 speed that's
gonna give us a little bit of an extra
edge when it comes to overall
performance and I wanted something that
wasn't going to be standing out too much
like all the RGB kits because honestly
you pay a little bit extra for that and
you don't get any extra performance
bonus so that's why I went with this kid
so those are the parts we're working
with today this is not going to be a
full 2
how to build video I do have one of
those up so I'll link it and you can
check that out if you want a
step-by-step guide I'm gonna put this
together and I'll pause from time to
time to share maybe quirks with you as
we go along and then at the end I will
not be able to share any performance
numbers with you because that is still
under embargo but for now we get to put
a system together and the reviews and
benchmarks will come later
here's our Lee Anne Lee 0:11 dynamic
co-developed with her Bower and this is
the white version so I've worked I've
actually built that system back there it
was in the air version of this case I
have not built in the non air the
original dynamic version so that's this
but it's special because its weight I'm
gonna leave the plastic covering on the
front and side panels for now while I
build I will pull this one off though
and I think our main question right now
is going to be where to mount the
all-in-one liquid cooler I'm probably
going to try to mount it's right back
here where it's got a setup for up to a
three hundred and sixty millimeter
radiator just need to double check and
make sure the tubing can reach over to
the CPU socket without looking like it's
too stretched out
alright guys at this point the build is
pretty much assembled I wanted to leave
you with a few notes before I actually
power it on for the first time first
there is that three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator mounting point there
towards the front I felt like it was
kind of empty without anything mounted
to it and I did decide to mount the
Allen one liquid cooler to the top here
rather than that there mainly because of
the way these tubes were coming across
it was just very awkward however I was
orienting it there and trying to route
it over so I just decided go at the top
it's got a nice easy loop down here and
it's gonna push that warm air from the
CPU at the top of the case but I wanted
to fill that space in so I've added
three cooler master RGB LED fans those
are optional they're not included in the
price of the build so they're purely
there mainly for aesthetics they're
gonna push a little bit of air through
but it's not in a very practical
direction but they're there so I wanted
to give some explanation as to why I
also wanted to point out I'm using the
sleeved cable extension kit that EVGA
provides for this 750 watt power supply
so that's also not included in the price
normally you would have just all-black
cabling things look a little bit nicer
so it kind of finishes off the build and
then finally for this case specifically
and actually any case that you might get
that has a USB type-c port in the front
that is a USB 3.1 gen2 10 gigabit 4
second port the ones that have the new
header you probably want to use a
motherboard that has that header to this
motherboard does not have that so I
would recommend definitely taking
another look at the gigabyte version
that I chose which is a z3 70 horas
gaming 5 which you can currently get for
about a hundred and seventy to 180
dollars very similar features to this
has actually got a next to m dot two
slot and it has the header so be able to
plug in all my front panels if that were
the case other than that though
everything's looking very pretty
actually like how the silver and blends
in with the rest of the case the silver
white and black overall and since it
looks like we have a successful initial
boot I am going to put the side panels
back on and peel off this protective
coating
and there it is guys the fastest
computer that you can currently build
specifically for PC gaming and it's only
gonna cost you around $2,400 of course a
little bit more hues everything that I
have included here today but check the
description down below and I will
include links to the stuff that I built
this system with as well as the original
list of parts that I did but the monthly
builds videos so you can pick and choose
what suits your purposes or your budget
for now though that's all for this video
thank you so much for watching and
definitely hit the thumbs-up button if
you enjoyed it I will be coming back
with some actual benchmark reviews of
the r-tx twenty eighty and twenty atti
very soon so don't forget to subscribe
to we will leave you guys with a little
bit of a montage of this completed
builds and thank you so much for
watching we'll see you in the next one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
