about the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro
series via the sponsor link in the
description so for about two years now
since 2016 or so PC gamers have suffered
when it comes to GPU choices after a
disappointing launched from Radeon Vega
last year and then astronomical prices
during the crypto GPU mining bubble the
Nvidia 10 series seemed to stagnate
after late 2017 which left us with only
the stopgap 1070 TI launch and then the
$3,000 volta based Titan VIII which was
out of most people's price range 2018
wasn't that much better but in mid
summer things actually started to
improve the inflated prices began to
come back down as crypto mining became
less viable and then finally last week
Nvidia launched the 20 series with
turing and RT x and holy shit they
really want $1,200 for the 28 ET i okay
so it perhaps was not the best or most
well-received launch and the prices are
absolutely really high for this new
series of graphics cards but let's try
to think about this rationally because
that is what this video is all about now
that Nvidia has at last launched a new
gaming GPU series with a new
architecture for the first time since
the 10 series debuted with the GTX 1080
on May 27th 2016 what do we do now we've
passed the launch that point in time
that so many people were waiting for so
that they could what this question is
multifaceted
much like the complex beef going on
between tech youtubers on Twitter right
now but I will simplify the answer by
splitting into four points and by the
way I'm assuming that if you're watching
this video you are at least somewhat
interested in buying a graphics card or
gaming PC and they're going high-end
with a GPU budget in the 400 to 700
dollar price range so first consider the
benchmarks we now know that the r-tx
2080 Ti is about 25 to 40 percent faster
than the GTX 1080 Ti especially if
you're looking at higher resolutions
like 4k or 1440p Ryle direct you to the
hardware unbox review where Steve tests
30 different games and found that on
average at 4k 30% improvement was his
results and then if you're talking the
r-tx 2080
you're looking at about the same
performance 2082 1080 TI depending on
the game that you're playing of course
but if you include pricing the price
factor definitely favors the GTX series
over the RT x-series so first off free
rich folks out there if you want the
best the best and you've got the money
to pay for it there is no question that
the 2080 ti is the way to go if you can
find them a secondary thing I want to do
in this video is actually reality check
prices and availability to see if you
can buy any of these promised cards
right now that's when ta titi a launch
date was pushed back one week for when
they're actually shipping but I believe
that means they're actually supposed to
ship out today currently the cheapest
one is 1170 dollars which is a bit more
expensive than the 1,000 dollar starting
prices Nvidia promised us beyond that
they're all $1200 and up so it's a
simple answer for you guys who want the
best graphics card possible if you have
to be able to gloat over your friends
with their 1080 T eyes by saying look I
have a 20 80 TI and spending $1200 on a
single GPU isn't a big deal for you this
is obviously what you should get but for
everyone else who's a little bit more
reasonable and isn't spending 1200 bucks
on a single GPU then the 2080 is what
you should be scrutinizing now 2080s are
available and they're shipping right now
on PC park picker if we sort by price
the cheapest one is 789 dollars and that
is reflected over on Newegg as well if
we're looking at just 20 ATS and
actually available for sale you can add
these to Curt and buy them right now so
I guess that is a positive
but again 790 dollars versus the
promised introductory level price which
was supposed to be $6.99 but if we
compare that to the 1080 TI
you can currently find that for 650
dollars at the cheapest and there's a
decent number available between 650 and
700 dollars the cheapest one is the
gigabyte one here and I'm also trying to
reality check these just to make sure
they over there available for sale and
yes for $650 right now at Amazon you can
go ahead and buy this gigabyte 1080 TI
OC with 11 gigs of VRAM by the way
versus the 8 gigs that you get with the
2080 however it is gddr5 X versus GT
year 6 it's a little bit slower but
point being with the 1080 TI and the
2080 you get about the same performance
with the 1080 TI you do get that 3 more
VRAM with the 2080 you get the potential
future performance of r-tx features
ray-tracing and DL SS which in the
future could be cool
but that provides me a great segue to
the second point I wanted to make which
is that Archie X is still off the
glorious new features of the RT X 20
series we still cannot viably quantify
the value of these new r-tx features
there is still no word on the
performance or the in-game impacts of
the new touring upgrades the Archie core
is integrated in a twenty series for ray
tracing the tensor cores that can handle
AI stuff and deep learning and should
pre be able to do DL SS which seems like
a cool feature if we could only test it
Windows updates are coming for ray
tracing but not until October now it's
most likely that we'll see these
features soonest in the titles that
Nvidia teased during that launch
presentation so shadow of the Tomb
Raider for example and maybe battlefield
5 we're told it's gonna be patched into
both games battlefield 5s release date
has already been pushed back though to
November 20th and for shadow of the Tomb
Raider we're not 100% sure when that
patch will be launched but probably
after the windows patch goes into effect
3d mark is also working on a ray tracing
test so this will be a synthetic but 3d
mark is generally a good means of
testing performance between GPUs this is
slated to launch along with Microsoft's
redstone 5 update which will be the next
major major update to Windows 10 so
we're expecting that in October so if
you've considered prices and you've
considered features maybe you should
consider not getting an Nvidia graphics
card as all Vega is it available is it
priced reasonably now maybe it's
definitely better than it was before
jumping back to PC part picker we can
see a very inexpensive Vegas 56 for 379
dollars although this is from nuoc
business and they've already changed the
price it's back up to the same price as
no ENCOM so never mind that it looks
like the cheapest Vega 56 that's in
stock and available for sales about four
hundred and five dollars the Sapphire
pulse version here so that's a pretty
good price considering what these have
sold for you know three four months ago
as for Vegas 64 is cheapest one here is
this gigabyte model for four hundred and
seventy dollars which does appear to
still be available and in stock that's
right that's a $30 meal and rebate card
for that also remember for the Vegas
you're currently getting a game pack
bundle with three games in it so that
may or may not be valuable for you two
if you like the games that are being
offered but if you are seriously
considering Vega I think the most valid
reason to do so would be pairing a Vega
56 in Vega 64 with a free sync monitor
free sync g-sync variable refresh rate
is still one of the best reasons to jump
into PC gaming if you're comparing it to
something like console gaming high
refresh rate and the way to get into
this with a good monitor that's showing
demonstrable value and features that are
upgrades over 1080 60 gaming that you
get with consoles is gonna be something
like a 27-inch 2560 by 1440 monitor and
if you can get a high refresh rate one
this one's 144 Hertz and if you can get
one that has free sync and you compare
it with a Vega graphics card you're
looking at a pretty good situation this
is an Acer model that's 350 dollars that
supports all those features it's
currently available on Amazon and if
you're looking at the cost of the year
Vega 56 in Vega 64 plus a monitor in
this range you're looking at probably
one to two hundred dollars savings
compared to getting say a gtx 1070 or
1080 and AG sync monitor with similar
specs and my fourth and final point i
want to make is that the price to
performance crown is still going to go
to the gtx 1070 and 1080 with the
current pricing and availability that's
out there if you just want a graphics
card if you want to get into high-end PC
gaming if you've been waiting to see
what launches are gonna happen the gtx
1070 and GT x 1080 are still right now
the best bang for your buck
there are many deals on these cards you
can get the 1070 now for sub of $400
look at that that's lower than the
original promised launch price back in
2016 that's amazing this has almost
never happened quite a few different
versions available these are available
for sale you can add to cart' check out
and buy them now further down the list
we even have GTX 1080s selling for as
little as four hundred and thirty
dollars reality checking again yes
that's actually the price $20 mail in
rebate card but you can buy it right now
for that much money keep an eye on 1070
t is in this range - there's a $400 1070
TI which might be a good choice greg
from science studio also posted a video
recently talking about the amazing deals
you can find on the secondary or used
market which I'm not going to dive into
here because it can vary by location but
that's also something you might consider
checking out bear in mind you're dealing
with the used market so you're not going
to get a warranty and stuff there
archive
it's there but the point is I think I
would definitely prefer a gtx 1070 or
1080 and a high refresh rate g-sync
monitor for about the same price as what
you could buy an Archie X 2080 for right
now if you're looking for the best bang
for the buck option and you don't want
to wait any longer since you've probably
already waited a decent number of time
for this 20 series of GPUs to launch
there's a couple more questions that
might come to your mind though for
example a lot of people have asked me if
they should buy now or wait another
month or two for November in the Black
Friday time period I would say by now if
you find a deal that you like there is a
chance that prices could go down before
Black Friday but they could also go up
in the US for example we're still
waiting to see if the tariffs that have
been announced by our government are
going to apply towards things like
gaming graphics cards according to this
john petty research article they will
and the 10% tariff goes into effect
today so we'll have to keep an eye and
see if that affects prices the only
people who I might suggest should wait
until say November ish timeframe is if
you're shopping for an entire system not
just a graphics card in that case it
might be worth your while to wait for
the Intel 9000 series CPUs which are
expected to launch in the next month or
two still don't know the exact launch
date for that but it would be worth it
to see the performance of those CPUs as
well as how that might affect the
pricing of this current stuff that's
available on the market but guys that is
my advice for now for anyone who saw the
2000 series launch and all the benchmark
graphs and everything but was looking
for what does all this mean that's what
I've been trying to give you guys today
I hope you've enjoyed it hit the thumbs
up button if you did and if anyone has
any questions please leave them for me
in the comment section down below and I
will be following up in another week and
a half or so with my October builds so
I'll come back at this and take a look
at pricing and availability then as well
so stay tuned for that too thanks again
for watching guys and we'll see you next
time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
