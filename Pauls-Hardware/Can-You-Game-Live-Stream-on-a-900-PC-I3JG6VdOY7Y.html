core p9 DTG click the sponsor link in
the description hey guys how's it going
- welcome to Pauls hardware today I'm
gonna be testing this gaming computer
right here and this computer's actually
been on quite a long journey I
originally built this system at the
beginning of 2018 as a solution for
people who wanted to build a gaming PC
who didn't necessarily have the money to
spend on an overpriced graphics card at
the time now graphics carts are still
pretty overpriced but they are coming
down in price so we do have more options
available now than we did back then but
about a month or month and a half ago I
updated this computer I switched it from
horizon 2200 G APU which is a quad-core
4 thread processor that has graphics
built in up to a risin 2600 X which is a
6 core 12 thread processor cost a bit
more money but there's a lot more CPU
horsepower available there now since the
upgraded CPU does not have a graphics
card we also had to add a GPU so for
that purpose I have a geforce gtx 1050
TI installed here with a four gig frame
buffer 4 gigs of VRAM so the goals for
today are pretty straightforward I want
to show you how much more performance
you get out of this system now in its
upgraded form which will cost you about
900 dollars if you were to build it as
is I also want to show you what kind of
difference you get in gaming going from
that older system to the newer system
and then finally I actually use this
system to game and stream at the same
time all run on the same system a couple
days ago so if you want to watch that
entire live stream it's a little over an
hour and I'll link that down in the
video's description but I'm also going
to show you the performance comparison
going from gaming on the old system
gaming on the new system and gaming and
streaming on the new system here's a
quick rundown of the parts on PC part
picker at the top you can see the 2600 X
which will cost you about 210 dollars
right now I like the X over the 2600
simply because you get a better cooler
the race spire vs. the race stealth of
course if you can find a really good
deal on like our rise in first gen 1700
or 1700 X an eight-core 16 thread
processor definitely give that a
consideration to here but for my
purposes
600x work just fine and since i'm not
manually overclocking the out-of-the-box
frequencies of the cpu are a bit higher
than you get with the 2600 or the 1700
the motherboard is the same that
gigabyte a be 350 end gaming wife I saw
a little mini ITX motherboard for about
110 dollars and actually pretty decent
power delivery - if you do want to get
into overclocking that is optional with
the be 350 chipset for our memory we got
a g.skill Trident z RGB kit ddr4 3200
double check whatever memory you do
choose and make sure it's compatible
with your motherboard check the
motherboards qvl list and I do go over
that in the upgrade video if you want to
check that out for our purposes this is
running at ddr4 3200 speed and the kid
I'm actually running is Casa latency 14
so it's a bit tighter timings and the
kit I have linked in the description but
it is $50 more expensive to so go with
what works and a little bit looser
timings aren't going to hurt your
performance very much we have a 240 gig
SSD for about $70 this is a SanDisk SSD
plus there's other SSDs in this range
that you can find but also give some
consideration to additional storage for
my purposes today I have a SSD that's
also plugged in via USB 3.0 providing me
some additional storage for the games I
have loaded up but if you do have an old
mechanical hard drive consider recycling
that into the system to give yourself
maybe an extra 1 or 2 terabytes of
storage for those bulky video games if
you don't have that you might consider
adding another 48 dollars to the price
of this computer in order to buy a one
or two terabyte mechanical hard drive in
order to add that the video card is the
gtx 1050 Ti and this is probably the
weak link in this computer a 1050 Ti is
a perfectly adequate GPU for gaming at
1080p this is costing about a hundred
and ninety dollars right now which is
still a little bit overpriced but not
crazy overpriced if you can increase
your budget to about $1,100 you can
spend about $400 on the graphics card
and leave everything else pretty much
the same and that'll allow you to get a
gtx 1070 and there are GTX 1070 s for
sale you do have to hunt a little bit to
find them but at least in the past week
best buy his head founders Edition GTX
1070 s for actual $400 price just have
to find the store where they're in stock
finally case and power supply the case
is only about 45 or 50 dollars the core
v1 from thermal take solid little case
Mini ITX gets the job done and then
power supply I have listed here as the
corsair CX 550 watt which is an 80 +
broadens power supply perfectly adequate
for 50 bucks to get the job done just to
point out I am actually using a cooler
master v6 50 in this actual build and I
have that link in the description too
but about 50 bucks is what you should be
spending on the power supply for this
system so if you're just looking at the
parts from the core system about 900
dollars is what you would spend or 1,100
if you're looking at that GPU upgrade to
the gtx 1070 i do want to point out
though that if you are about to embark
on a professional video gaming and
streaming career that you will need a
little bit more besides just this system
you'll probably need Windows 10 and I
have a video on getting Windows 10 for
cheap about $30.00 so check that video
too if you're interested and then you're
gonna need some peripherals some
accessories you also need an internet
connection but I'm assuming you already
have that since you're watching this
video right now accessories so mouse and
keyboard you can get mouse and keyboard
combo for 25 or 30 dollars this
particular mouse I've been using and
this is the master keys light L I've
just been enjoying this mouse cuz it's
very small and very cheap and actually
that's pretty good tracking so there you
go a link that in the description I was
using a headset with a built-in
microphone this is kind of a get you
started setup for audio because you need
to hear and may not want speakers there
are other mic options of course USB
Attached mics you can look into a
soundboard but this is a perfectly
adequate solution just to get your
streaming career up and running then of
course once you get all your
sponsorships then you can invest in an
upgrade of your gear I like to have a
gamepad available this is just a xbox
360 controller that's wired via USB you
can get an Xbox one controller that
actually connects via bluetooth and this
has Bluetooth built in so that's an
option
although bluetooth does add a bit of
latency so consider your options there
if you want to be super pro and then
finally a webcam because people are
gonna want to see your pretty face along
with the game that you're playing this
is a Logitech c920 which I consider to
be kind of the entry-level webcam for
gaming and streaming your system will
require a little bit of processing
performance in order to handle this
webcam so bear that in mind there are of
course other better options now than the
Logitech c920 Logitech has a C 930 and I
believe a 4k option razor has options so
there's other ones out there but if you
don't have spend a hundred plus bucks
you can get that for 50 or 60 so let's
talk performance analysis next and
before
we get into gaming let's just talk about
the raw CP performance since that's a
big part of the upgrade you get going
from the 2200 G to the 2600 X we're just
looking at Cinebench scores here
Cinebench is a very simple free program
you can use to test your CPUs
performance 2600 X overall score of 13
58 which is like a lot more than 565 so
that's just your raw upgrade and CPU
performance quantified there via a
number of course single thread
performance is going to be more similar
now both CPUs are running on pretty much
the same architecture so if you got them
to run at the same frequency if you
overclock the 2200 G for example these
would probably have similar scores for
single thread but that multi thread
performance is really where it's at when
you're looking at this upgrade taking a
look at CPU mark scores next overall in
single thread both represented here 2600
X scores 15000 eighty-five compared to
the 2200 G coming in just shy of 8000 so
again just a massive increase in raw
performance remember when you're playing
video games you don't always need a lot
of CPU performance but if you're gaming
and doing something else like streaming
or if you're playing a newer game that's
gonna actually take advantage two more
threads more threads more cores are very
good just generally speaking finally we
have blender this is an application that
people actually use to render things so
nice to have it represented here
remember this is the score or time in
seconds so faster is better 2600 X gets
the fishy can't render done in 34 point
nine seconds compared to seventy three
point two for the 2200 G and only 352
seconds compared to 880 for the BMW
render so there's just some quick hits
evidence for you guys to show you the
type of performance increase you get by
spending about 110 dollars more on that
upgraded processor of course you just
can't take the processor price
difference by itself because you also
have to add in the cost of a discrete
GPU which may be more or less depending
on what graphics card you go with so
let's move into game testing I want to
point a few things out from the get-go
one is that I'm testing the $500 PC and
then the $900 PC and then a $900 PC
while gaming and streaming at the same
time I'm using MSI Afterburner as well
as rivatuner in order to show you guys
an on-screen display of the actual frame
rates as well as GPU and CPU stats so
you guys can take a look at those for
your reference
finally all these benchmarks are run
live and I wasn't using built-in
benchmarks or anything like
so it's ballpark comparisons and I'm
giving you a ballpark frame rates for
what I was seeing
versus an actual a to be comparison
because that wouldn't be exactly fair
but starting out with GTA 5 and then the
$500 PC it did pretty well getting about
55 to 65 frames per second on average
now when we started gaming with the $900
PC I found a strange issue which was
that there seems to be some sort of
frame rate lock going on and I was not
able to figure out why I was getting 60
frames per second solid or 45 frames per
second solid and whether I was doing the
ingame settings or global settings it
would not fix itself it might have
something to do with rivatuner I wasn't
able to determine the actual cause but
long story short though you should be
able to get well above 60 frames per
second on the system with GTA 5 you just
might need to go in and change some of
the settings from what I did when I was
gaming and streaming actually had the
same issue and this actually first came
up while I was doing the livestream
everyone seemed to notice
I was only heading 45 frames per second
and was staying there pretty solidly
versus when you normally play with vsync
off when you'll see some fluctuation
there so I apologize my GTA 5 numbers
weren't exactly what they should be but
I was able to successfully game and
stream on the system at the same time so
that's cool and I noticed as well as
people in chat that if you looked at the
GPU usage while I was doing this
it was way lower than it should be
usually GPU usage for GTA 5 will be at
99 percent or close to a hundred percent
this was way less and the temperature
was way less so I can't exactly say what
was going on here let's move on to some
tests that actually went better though
player unknowns belgrad's on the $500 PC
we had to set it to very low pretty much
the lowest possible settings with motion
blur and vsync off even then we were
just barely getting about 30 frames per
second about 27 to 35 frames per second
on average was that I was seeing but
then when you would see the game loading
in additional textures it would actually
tank the frame rate even more getting it
down to 15 frames per second or lower
and that was definitely with happening
when the vram was maxed out switching
over to the $900 PC and just doing game
testing not streaming at low settings so
slightly improved over the very low
settings we jumped up to 65 to 75 frames
per second it would tank down a little
bits in the 60 frames per second range I
noticed when there was a lot of grass
on-screen that has has been noted by
players and bench markers in the past
that it doesn't handle grass very well
but getting well above 60 frames per
second in most scenarios
shows you the definite improvement you
get going from the $500 PC to the $900
PC even when you add the task of gaming
and streaming at the same time we're
still getting pretty decent frame rates
actually only about a 5 fps I would say
drop-off when playing at low going from
65 to 75 down to maybe 60 to 75 and then
I did also test this at very low and I
was actually getting 80 to 90 frames per
second at that very low frame rate but
honestly pub G on very low doesn't look
all that great the water the water looks
horrible so low is a nice step up moving
on to fortnight with the $500 PC I was
playing at lowest settings with motion
blur on and here I must admit that when
I originally tested this I had the frame
rate cap on so it was getting 60 frames
per second pretty steadily which is good
if you have a 60 Hertz monitor but I
wasn't actually seeing the max
performance that it was able to get
nonetheless I switched over to the $900
PC and with gaming only bumped the
settings up to medium still have motion
blur on and the frame rate was 105 220
frames per second so that's a very nice
bump in frame rate as well as in a
visual quality and actually when I
switched to gaming and streaming at the
same time I noticed a very little impact
with fortnight and I think fortnight is
a much more GPU intensive gaming that it
is CPU intensive game in fact CPU usage
was down any like 10% range which seems
very low that means when you add the
additional task of gaming and streaming
at the same time the 2600 X has plenty
of additional cores and threads to work
with so it's like hey no problem I'll
encode that on the side and you will see
almost no performance difference in your
gameplay so we're only seeing about 100
215 frames per second versus hundred and
five to 120 and the final game I'm
testing is overwatch with the $500 PC I
was using the low preset with the render
scale set to 100% and we were getting 50
to 65 frames per second adequate but
could be a little bit better overwatch
has a ton of display scaling settings
and that kind of thing so bumping the
display scaling down to 75 would get us
well above 60 frames per second
overwatch is incredibly flexible in this
regard but I want to see if we could get
some decent frame rates while also
having a good-looking high-quality game
so with the $900 PC we went from the low
preset up to the high preset render
scale was still at a hundred percent and
we were getting 90 to 110 frames per
second so from low to high and for
5265 all the way up to 90 210 it was a
much much better gaming experience and
then when we added gaming and streaming
at the same time I think similar to
fortnight this is not a very CPU
intensive game so there's plenty of CPU
overhead left over to do the encoding on
the fly' so pretty much the same frame
rate about 90 210 frames per second so I
think the gaming and streaming thing at
the same time is actually a great way to
show how a system that has a lot more
CPU processing horsepower can actually
be made use of in a situation when you
wouldn't get as much performance out of
that if all you were doing was playing
the video games it also shows that if
you're not interested in streaming or
doing something beyond just gaming with
your system like video editing or
something like that
you can probably get away just fine with
that quad core and yes if you're
wondering you could add as a screed
graphics card like the 1050 Ti to the
2200 G quad core just in my personal
opinion I like I like jumping up to the
six cores if you have that option
available to you couple more steps to
show you guys one was gonna be
temperatures and I was using the race
spire cooler with this CPU which did a
perfectly adequate job although it was
getting a little bit warm at time
specifically while gaming and streaming
it actually hit 88 degrees I believe
eighty eight point five degrees Celsius
max and at that point it will start to
dip the frequency of the CP a little bit
in order to ease off on the heat so that
it can be dispersed and keep the
temperatures within range which was okay
but it does go to show you that this
system having been upgraded to $500 to
$900 still has more stuff you could add
to it in the future so an aftermarket
CPU cooler maybe something with some
liquid cooling which I believe has a
little bit of support in this case if
you attach it to the front up there is
possibility in the future I was gonna do
a sound test too but I don't feel like
it's really needed it is mid-range sound
it's not too loud but definitely when
everything's under load everything
starts to crank up a little bit but
thankfully when I did my actual live
testing gaming and streaming I had these
headphones on and even with these
headphones which are open so I can hear
pretty much most of what's going on
around me I didn't notice the noise of
the system sitting directly next to me
at all the entire time so a bit of
anecdotal noise level performance
metrics for you there but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for this video again if
you're interested in building the system
