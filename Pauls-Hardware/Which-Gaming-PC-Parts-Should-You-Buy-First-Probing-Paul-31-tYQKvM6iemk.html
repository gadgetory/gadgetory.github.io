welcome to probing Paul episode number
31 this is my monthly tech Q&amp;amp;A video
that I do and this is the last episode
for 2018 so bidding a fond farewell to
this year we can see many older probing
Paul's that I have done in the past so
feel free to check those out if you want
to see me answer other questions it
should be a list in the description with
timestamps till the questions I'm
answering today so let's get right into
it all these questions are from the
comments of last month's video so feel
free to comment on this video if you
want to ask me a question first
questions from abdullah 5-6 he says hey
Paul if I want to buy PC parts to do a
build and I can't buy all the parts at
the same time what part should I start
with I've been asked this before and the
general advice is to just wait wait
until you can buy your parts at the same
time that way you can get everything put
the system together and you will
immediately know if something's gone
wrong something that doesn't fit
together right it will also give you the
advantage of waiting until you know
maybe another month a few months down
the road more products might come out
that are newer that you might regret
having bought something early that said
if you absolutely want to start buying
stuff now I would say start with a case
because a case is something that you can
physically take out of the box and look
at and inspect and find out if there's
anything actually wrong with it
other parts like a motherboard or a CPU
or memory or graphics card if you buy
early you can't install them to see if
they work or don't work and it's very
important to find out quickly if you
have a defective part because then you
can return it to the retailer you bought
it from if you wait and more than 30
days have gone by usually you have to
deal with the manufacturer manufacturer
turnaround times can take a couple weeks
so it's best to find out if you have
defective parts early on so for that
reason just don't buy stuff early wait
until you've got it all at once but I
guess the short answer to your question
is the case and again make sure you take
it out right away and find out if
there's any defects next question from
Jackie gee Jackie says hey Paul I'm
trying to build a PC for the first time
however when using PC part picture I got
a compatibility note saying motherboard
I'm about to number one slot shares
bandwidth with SATA 6 gigabits per
second ports
about who's populated say the port is
disabled I have no idea what this means
I'm a PC noob and please explain it so
first off here's the incompatibility
notification and note it's not a bang
like this one here it's just a question
mark it's kind of an FYI motherboard I'm
about to and I'm slot shares the shares
bandwidth so here's what we're looking
at this is a generic block diagram for
an Intel processor with a chipset these
II 370 chipset to be specific now the
stuff that directly connects to the CPU
like your PCI Express Lanes maybe your
memory but the chipset also has a bunch
of stuff connected to it and the chipset
communicates to the CPU via at DMI at
least that's what Intel calls it this is
effectively a PCI Express by 4
interconnect so note that that's less
than what you get directly connected
with a GPU slot for example long story
short there's lots of stuff that
connects through the chipset it needs to
share this bandwidth so sometimes
manufacturers decide to put a switch to
connect up certain things so that they
can have kind of the best of both worlds
here's another block diagram for a
specific z97 motherboard and here you
can see a switch there's an MDOT two
slot connected there as well as some
SATA ports so basically what they're
telling is you can't use both of these
at the same time so just beware now for
most people that's not a big deal
they'd rather have the MDOT two slots
and note that there are also more SATA
ports available there - so what PC park
picker is doing is saying hey if you're
planning to build a system and connect
up six or eight SATA hard drives or SSDs
to the system at the same time and that
I'm not to slot you won't be able to do
that you'll have to choose one or the
other at least in the case of a couple
the SATA slots and the MDOT two but most
of the time there's lots of others say
two slots to you so it's not a big deal
for most people who aren't completely
kidding their system out with drives
thanks for the question though Jackie
next up is Magnus below who says hey
Paul I'm currently saving up for a
high-end desktop with the 9900 K and a
twenty ATT I was thinking about adding a
360 millimeter water cooler an
all-in-one he's plenty of having four
exhaust and two intake fans the fractal
define s2 is the case he's worried about
air pressure so here's a define s2 it's
got space for a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator at the top it comes
with two hundred and forty millimeter
fans in the front and a hundred and
forty millimeter fan for the exhaust so
the concern here is 320 millimeter fans
at the top exhausting 140 at the back
exhausting and two intakes means your
have negative pressure and we usually
recommend against negative pressure but
you should also consider that those
three top fans are going to be up
against a radiator their airflow is
going to be impeded somewhat by that and
it depends on the radiator how much that
actually affects it also your front fans
are 140 s whereas those top fans are
gonna be 120 s so you're gonna get a
little bit more airflow out of 140
millimeter fan than 820 millimeter fans
so all that said you're probably still
gonna have a bit of a negative air
pressure situation with this setup but
you're never going to know for sure how
it's gonna affect your performance
unless you actually do a/b testing with
your specific system setup as is I
wouldn't be too concerned with this
configuration but maybe try it out as is
and then maybe just take that back fan
and flip it to an intake versus an
exhaust and see if that affects your
temperature as much I would say you're
probably just fine with the
configuration you're planning though
next question here from KIU one three
one two and it's a multi-part question
about my Riptide build that I did over
the summer and the Corsair 1000d first
is what's the clearance for the Mini ITX
CPU cooler and the answer there is that
completely varies depending on what
slots you have populated in your upper
motherboard if you're using up all the
slots in the upper full-size motherboard
then you will have less clearance for
that lower motherboard but I would say
generally speaking you should probably
stick to a low profile or B no need to
go as low profile as you do and like
those super narrow cases you do have a
bit of flexibility but consider what
you're putting in the upper system next
is how do I find using the light loop
fans in the 1000 D does a little kasam
but the answer is yes it does look
awesome I've tried a few different
configurations with this and I have a
few videos in my Riptide playlist where
I kind of go over that doing the LED
setup and a few of the random issues
I've had with this build I will say
they're not the most practical because
there are better performing fans that
you can get but when you have as many
fans and the 1000d as it can fits I feel
like you know that becomes a little bit
less of a concern the final question is
how do I keep encase fans for open or on
for the FreeNAS system because if I
connect it all to the Mini ITX
motherboard I lose some RGB
functionality again in the Riptide video
where I talk about plugging everything
and I kind of go over some of that
detail but the short answer is the
Corsair like loop fans have two plugs
one is for the LEDs and one is for the
fan itself so for two intakes and one
exhaust I have the fans connected to the
mini ITX motherboard and then the LEDs
going to the larger system so when just
the mini
text system is on all of the lights in
the case are off but it still has a few
fans on for airflow and then when you
turn on the big system all the lights
come on but thank you very much Caillou
for your question and I'm glad you liked
my beard but unfortunately shaved it off
at the beginning of this month so it'll
be back it'll be back next year another
question here from blank what's the
easiest way to delete all old display
drivers when switching from one GP to
another so if you're asking about
easiest it would probably just be to use
the uninstall function of the Nvidia or
AMD driver package that you have
installed and then swap the cards and
then install the new one but I always
recommend especially if you're switching
from one brand to another display driver
uninstaller ddu as it's also known you
can find it over on guru of 3d and I
will link that in the video's
description
you do need to restart your system in
safe mode in order to run it so I'll
also link the video of the best way to
access your BIOS and UEFI in the
description so you guys can check that
and it kind of kind of walks you through
it and specifically using this blade
driver uninstaller it's a great combo
for that and if you're planning to do
a/b testing I would absolutely recommend
using that method just a few more
questions
yeah million xfz asks the oft asked
question what about the HT PC build and
that I'm gonna actually go straight to
the follow up to this too from Jack's
Macintosh asking about the solar roof
the Tesla solar and power wall
installation Jack's also asking about
mechanical keyboards here Jack I will
say I recommend the MX brown switches
her MX red switches if you don't want to
make a lot of noise Cherry MX switches
of course there's kind of the gold
standard with mechanical keyboards but
you have to hunt a little bit more to
find good deals on those the knockoffs
that you can find
unlike some razer keyboards and others
honestly aren't really that much
different too so pick your poison when
it comes to the design but back to the
actual questions the HTPC video well I
finally posted a follow up on that's
actually just earlier this week so
thanks to all you guys have checked that
out the main problem was with the wood I
get the wood Reed kilns I did not get
like all the way along with the project
but I've gotten to the point where we
sanded and primed it and everything so
that's a big step forward and I got more
planned on that coming in the next week
or two and then of course the tesla
powerwall and installation video I also
posted about a week week and a half ago
with a full timeline and running down
the installation and the time lapses in
frozen
and I'm also planning in another
follow-up to that one because I got a
bunch of additional questions also
there's one part I sort of messed up on
which when talking about the always-on
internet connection requirements Tesla
has followed up with me about that and I
want to clarify that a little bit more
too so keep your eye out in the next
week and two for that video as well I
have one last question this one from
Jeremy Branson does being probed a 30
times hurt well now that it's been 31
times I will say you do get used to it
over time but you know I've really
enjoyed being probed by you guys in 2018
so I want to know in the comments below
of course further questions you might
have for me but also what you guys have
planned for 2019 are you starting a new
job or going to school did you get
engaged or something like that just just
let me know because I'm curious what's
going on with you guys but thank you so
much for probing me all these many times
in 2018 I will be open for additional
probing in 2019 I should wrap things up
though thank you so much for watching oh
the one last thing I forgot to even
point out the thumbnail of this video
I'm in the middle of a home-improvement
project going on right now so that's why
I haven't posted as many videos in the
past few days but I do have video on
this coming up too so if you guys want
to see me roun innovate in my bathroom
you should definitely subscribe but
thank you guys so much again for
watching and we'll see you in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
