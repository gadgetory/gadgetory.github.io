absolutely the thought occurred to me
the other day that if you have just
gotten into PC building within the past
5 years or so and if you've gone with
the prevailing recommendations based on
performance and market share that is to
buy an Intel based system then you just
might be a bit confused if you decide to
put together a Rison based computer now
that AMD is back in the game
that's because Intel has used LGA or
land grid array CPU sockets since about
2004 with the introduction of the
Pentium 4 whereas AMD continues to use
PGA or pin at grid array today we'll be
exploring the pros and cons of both
designs the simplest way to describe
both socket types is by indicating where
the pins are for LGA the pins are on the
motherboard and the CPU itself has pads
gold-plated contact points that line up
with the pins in the socket each pad
makes contact with one pin so data or
power can be transferred for PGA the
pins are on the CPU and rather than pads
on the motherboard there's a socket with
holes lined up with the CPU pins this is
known as a zero insertion force socket
meaning that with the installation lever
raised the CPU should drop in easily
without any pressure applied the lepor
can then be dropped back into place to
secure the CPU of course there are other
ways to surface mount a component onto a
motherboard or PCB and while I won't
delve into older configurations like
dual inline package chip carrier or the
slot mounts that Pentium 2 and 3 is used
I did want to quickly mention BGA or
ball grid array this is F CPUs and GPUs
are usually installed in laptops and
consoles which aren't meant to be end
user serviceable there's a similarity to
PGA and LGA with BGA though in that you
have a specific number of contact points
that need to hook up between the chip
and the board but ball grid array uses
tiny balls of solder or solder to
preempt pronunciation police in the
comments instead of pins or pads that
need to be aligned on the chip and then
reflow door heat it up to the point
where they melts and secured
shipped to the board this is usually
done with specialized equipment but I'll
post a couple links in the description
to videos of people who are crazy enough
to do it at home needless to say this is
not recommended for most home builders
but now if you hear BGA you'll know what
that means - so let's take a little
closer look at LGA land grid array
Intel's preferred socket itself naming
scheme is pretty straightforward it's
just
LGA followed by the number of the pins
in the motherboard sockets or the number
of pads on the CPU which should be the
same so LGA 1151 has 1151 contacts on
the bottom LGA 2011 has 2011 contacts
LGA 2011 - 3 also has 2011 contacts but
they changed the socket so it's not
backwards compatible we'll delve into
backwards compatibility in a different
video installing an LGA processor
involves lifting a lever arm or two
lever arms in the case of intelligent
thew Xia's platform with the arm raised
the lid can lift up the CPU can be
aligned by referencing the tiny little
gold triangle that's on the corner of
the CPU as well as on the corner of the
socket and the processor can be gently
dropped in the lid then goes back down
slips under a catch and then the lever
arm or arms can be pushed back down with
a little bit of pressure to secure the
CPU in the socket it's not the simplest
method but it does get the job done one
of the big benefits of LGA and I think
this is actually why Intel changed over
to it in the first place is that it's
much harder to damage the CPU itself
there are no pins to bend or break and
since the CPU is usually going to be the
more expensive perks it does make some
sense to transfer the more delicate
parts of the interface to the
motherboard
although motherboard manufacturers have
probably been dealing with more RMA's
since then LGA motherboards on the other
hand are incredibly delicate when it
comes to the socket and basically if you
damage those pins your motherboard is
pretty much toast I've managed to repair
LGA pins on a motherboard only once and
it was an X 58 LGA 1366 board and I had
three identical boards with damaged
sockets to work with I managed to get
only one working the difficulty is
mainly due to the socket pins themselves
being smaller flatter and sort of angled
as they come up out of the socket so
they have a little bit of give under
pressure when the CPU is installed I
will say that I like LGA sockets for the
ease of disassembly though as the CPU is
held very securely in the socket which
if you're working with an aftermarket
cooler now AMD for their part has
produced LGA CPUs in the past they're
Opteron line in 2006 for example was LGA
1 207 but by and large they've stuck
with PGA for their consumer parts AMD
actually brands their PGA sockets with
names such as AM 3 sm 2 and 4 Rison now
AM 4 but they can still be identified by
their pin cuts and 4 for example could
also be referred to as PGA 1331 but
we'll stick with a m4 since it rolls off
a little bit more easily installing a
PGA CPU is quite simple just to make
sure to mine those pins on the CPU
itself you don't want to bend them or
even touch them if you can possibly
avoid it the am for socket has a lever
on one side that you just simply lift up
and then again you align the gold
triangle that's on the corner of the CPU
was a triangle that should be on the
socket itself and it should just drop
right in again this is a zero insertion
force socket sure it's by the way are
available at my store via the link in
the description and that means that it
should drop in with zero pressure drop
the lever arm back down and you're done
one of the great things about PGA is
that the motherboard socket is much more
durable with no delicate pins on there
you don't even really need a cover for
the socket like you do with LGA which is
pretty nice the pins are on the CPU side
though and while they're not as delicate
as LGA pins on a motherboard there are
they are exposed and they can be bent or
even broken if handled improperly my
advice is to keep the CPU in its
protective clamshell until you're ready
to install it and again never try to
force the CPU into a socket
fortunately with PGA a bent CPU pin or
even a few of them is not the end of the
world
I personally repaired probably at least
a hundred PGA CPUs with bent pins since
back in my time when working in an Omega
I'm a department and some of them that
were really really bad I basically just
had to use a razor blade steady hands
and lots of patience
use at your own risk of course and
remember that if a pin breaks off your
CPU is toast
but it is certainly a lot more feasible
than repairing a damaged LGA socket on a
motherboard finally when removing a PGA
CPU there's kind of a pain in the butt
thing that can happen where the thermal
paste sticks the CPU to the CPU cooler
and when you're pulling the CPU cooler
off you end up pulling the CPU out of
the socket along with it
that the lever arm raised this happened
to me again just recently as well as
Kyle when we were doing our eyes
interviews and lots mostly not a big
deal I have seen people lose CPU pins
when this happens just be careful when
you're removing your cooler and remember
that's easier to pull the cooler off
while the thermal paste is still warm so
to sum up I have four categories ease of
installation CPU durability motherboard
durability and ease of D installation
VGA takes the lead for installation and
motherboard durability and LGA gets the
win when it comes to CPU durability and
D installation
so both sockets have their pros and cons
and while other factors such as
performance and features will probably
weigh more heavily for you when deciding
on what platform to build your next
system on hopefully this video has
helped you learn a little bit more about
the nuances between the two I fell for
this video though so hit that like
button if you enjoyed it share with your
friends who are maybe just learning
about pcs subscribe to my channel for
more videos coming soon including that
one on rising 5 overclocking that still
in the works check out the description
