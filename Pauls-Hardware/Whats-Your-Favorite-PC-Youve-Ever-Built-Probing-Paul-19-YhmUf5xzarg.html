how's it going guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware this is probing Paul
episode number 19 my monthly Q&amp;amp;A video
where I answer questions that you guys
ask usually in last month's videos so
going back to last month which was
episode 18 I always seem to get a screen
cap with my eyes closed apparently for
this but these are all the history of
probing Paul's going back many many
years so check them out I guess if you
want me to answer other random questions
for today I'm gonna dive right into it
again all these were asked in last
month's video in the comments section so
if you have questions want me to answer
for next month leave them down there
starting off with Austin Shoffner who
asks could AMD put the Vega 56 or 64
chips on a PCB with gddr5 as far as the
video memory or are these chips designed
only to work with one type of VRAM the
only reason I would suggest this is
lower costs and cad MSRP a lot better
yields feel like HP m2 is extreme
overkill
seems almost pointless right now now the
decision to go with HP m2 memory by AMD
or Radeon technologies group was made
pretty early on from my understanding
and it was definitely a risk that did
not pay out andy's kind of known for
doing stuff like this in the past I mean
go all the way back to them being the
first ones to integrate the memory
controller onto the processor and other
steps that they've made a 64-bit
processing that kind of thing they've
done some cool stuff in the past HP m2
memory doesn't stand out as one of their
best decisions now for any benefits the
HP m2 might have as far as the increased
amount of bandwidth it's a it's a it's
available and the performance in some
games it's probably gonna be some time
before we see the software catching up
to sort of take more advantage of the
hardware's capabilities and like we've
heard from lots of sources although
maybe not directly from Radeon
technologies group is it hbm to yields
are low that's led to
difficulty bringing the product to
market now when it comes to the actual
physical capability of what the Jeep you
can do the GPU was designed with a
memory controller that's integrated and
that memory controller only works with
HBM - so it's not something where they
could just take it and swap out that
memory there's benefits that are gained
there but it's just not paid out here
for AMD so I think that's a big reason
why we're seeing limited availability of
Vegas 56 and 64 chips and I don't know
hopefully that improves in the future
but it's just one of those future things
that we're not really sure what the
answer is gonna be so thank you for your
question though next up from everything
is fire hey Paul if you weren't a tech
tuber would you still have a system or
systems with enthusiast grade parts
1080i is until X processors dual GPUs
and extravagant water loops for example
wouldn't know if you were in if you were
into videography or very into gaming
before making your channels so there's
multiple threats to answer this question
I would say yes but definitely not to
the extreme that I have right now if I
go back historically I have purchased
top-end graphics part cards before
before I was into the tech world very
much but I was into computers so like I
bought a 7800 GTX back in the day and
video graphics card that was like 500
bucks at the time that was a huge
investment for me because I was you know
wasn't making a ton of money at the time
and everything I have I was why I was an
early adopter of intel's enthusiast
platform back when they introduced X 56
and they're their first enthusiast class
stuff with their triple channel memory
and that was in the Hallam and I got an
i7 920 but this is kind of where the the
genesis of like I've done a few
entry-level like I did an entry-level X
399 builds theoretical build recently I
did an entry-level X 99 build and I'm
probably gonna do something similar with
the with X 299 but the idea is for
people who are into computers you see
that enthusiast class of hardware is
like man that's that's where the real
power players go and the people who are
like impractical with how they spend the
money and they don't really care if
they're gonna make use of it they just
want like a really really fast computer
like I have some level or appreciation
for that but I also understand that if
trying to invest in that type of
hardware it's really expensive so you
got to kind of figure out what you can
invest in if you are just buying the
stuff outright yourself now the things I
probably wouldn't do extravagant water
loops is something that I always had a
fascination for and a vague interest in
but never any inclination to investing
my own money and so that's probably
something that wouldn't have dove into
if it wasn't for like the connection I
originally got two years ago when I
originally built Arctic Panther Jay
helped me kind of figure out how to
actually put it together and do the hard
line to bending and everything he also
put me in touch with ek and they
sponsored the build so water cooling is
one of those things where the price to
performance doesn't pan out quite as
much and it's it's it's that extra notch
up of enthusiasts level and I would say
that's probably something that it would
have taken a bit more for me to get into
if it wasn't for the fact that I did
YouTube and stuff but videography I've
been interested in going all the way
back to college actually went to college
for cinema television and that was a big
reason why I built my own computers
because like I didn't like going into
the lab to edit and stuff like that I'd
rather have my own computer that I built
and like be able to edit in my dorm room
or whatever but yeah I I really enjoy
this stuff and I don't think I could do
what I do as often as I do if I didn't
actually think it was pretty cool and
everything all right next question from
Nick has arrived are you ever gonna do
home automation he says it is very fun
that is alright so a good question and
something that I have speculated about
getting into so let's start from the
negative side first I follow on Twitter
Internet of and Internet of on
Twitter it's a really funny account to
follow because he'll point out all of
the snafu situations that have people
have gotten into because manufacturers
like sticking Wi-Fi into everything now
and giving them Internet access and
being part of the Internet of Things
home automation when it comes to like
like like keys you know like the remote
locks they have and that kind of thing
I'm a little bit sketchy er about I'm
not quite ready to take a lot of the
vital functions of my home and give them
Internet and Internet access and that
kind of thing a little bit more curious
about DIY
sort of making things that function in
your home using technology but that's
not necessarily part of some larger
scheme or some big company that sold you
the product or something like that so
maybe I might get into something like
that I know that's a little vague but I
haven't I haven't really researched it
too much what I am in the process I've
just started the process of doing right
now is upgrading my entire electrical
system in the home so I'm gonna get a
tesla powerwall I've already put a
deposit down on that and I'm gonna be
getting a solar put in and then we also
have some some home improvement plans
that are in the works so I'm probably
gonna document a lot of that stuff and I
do plan on trying to integrate
technology to some degree so home
automation is probably gonna be part of
that and it's just gonna be like we'll
see how far I go with it and also kind
of what I'm familiar with because like I
said I don't want I don't want Internet
connected locks on my home for example
I'm not I'm not quite to that point yet
but yeah hopefully that gives you good
answer Nick thank you for the question
moving on to the next question Peter
no wack Peter Peter Nowak I hope I'm
pronouncing that ok hi Paul I bought my
PC as a budget rig some time ago I
switched from the G 32:58 a very very
capable dual-core an entry-level CPU to
an i7 4790k
my question is there a point to changing
my motherboard will I increase
performance when I switched from an MSI
b85 PC mate to some z97 chipset based
motherboard by the way next nice content
keep up the good work thank you very
much
Pyotr so I believe this is the
motherboard the MSI be 85 G 41 PC mate
from MSI a budget motherboard but you
know it's got all the basic functions
that you kind of want on there but it is
limited by the chipsets which is the
Intel v85 chipset which is a business
chipset which is not part of Intel's
scheme for having fully unlocked
overclocking capabilities so for that
you need to upgrade to a z97 motherboard
but is that really worth it
C 97 is sort of on its way out you can
tell because Newegg has some of them
still around and hanging out in stock
but most of them are refurb models there
is an as rocks that you can buy new for
about $125 pricing is a little all over
the place but maybe not necessarily the
best pricing if you're comparing it to
modern stuff right now so the answer to
your question is do you want to
overclock if you want to overclock if
you're interested in that and if you've
got an a you know
one hundred and hundred twenty-five
dollars to spare then sure maybe upgrade
your motherboard pop it in there and
then you can maybe get a little bit more
performance out of your CPU bear in mind
if you do that you're probably gonna
want an aftermarket CPU cooler which you
can get away with for thirty to forty
dollars and then you also might consider
that if you already have Windows
installed on the system and activated if
you swap your motherboard there's a good
chance you will need a new copy of
Windows to install on that new system
because the software will look at it as
a new system completely so it's kind of
your trade-offs I would say since you've
got a 4790k that already runs at a
pretty decent clock speed as it is
unless you really really just want to
dive into overclocking you're probably
fine as is and just you know hang out
with your system because you got a
pretty capable system right now give it
another year or two and then can I look
at the landscape and see if there's any
upgrade options that make sense to you
for upgrading your platform overall next
up is Dylan bright god what would be
some good jobs or degrees to get into if
someone wanted to work in the hardware
aspect of computers rather than software
or data alright big ole grain of salt
with my recommendations here because
like I said I went to college for cinema
television so I'm gonna kind of give you
high-level recommendations here if you
want to work with software with hardware
you're going to want to be focused on
your engineering and we're gonna be
focused on science so physics just just
the fundamentals of how electricity
works the fundamentals of design because
that's a lot of the stuff that goes into
actually developing the hardware to
function properly if you're looking at
jobs then I would definitely say
consider some entry-level positions it's
actual computer manufacturers and then
beyond that don't ignore software
completely that's actually a mistake
that I would say I've made in the past I
am not very good at like coding or the
software side I have a you know decent
grasp of the fundamentals but you know I
can't go in and write my own code for it
for the most part so I would say keep
that in mind because they do pair
together very closely and you don't want
to get too you know I have too much
knowledge on one side without the other
so I hope some of that information has
been vaguely helpful but let's move on
to the next question this is what I call
the a
fanboys lament right now and sorry I
Boog I didn't mean to like specifically
call you a fanboy but you do say you do
to start out by saying what does a
die-hard fan of AMD like me do in this
case and this is just the the the PC
building landscape right now he doesn't
have a GPU he has a full built computer
his rx4 80 died and he had to return it
and apparently he hasn't been able to
get it replaced so I'm not sure what the
deal is there he wanted to wait for Vega
it's been six months there's no Vega and
now that it's actually out there really
overpriced he wanted to buy a Vegas 64
but yeah so he's a click away from
buying a tiny DTI since he's been saving
for so long but he's just not sure
whether he should take the plunge or not
he says I still hate him video simply
because they're dominating the market I
don't think that's a reason that hates a
company but I mean I can understand that
if you're into AMD I mean they've done
some stuff in the past that a lot of
people have looked at like their support
for open source and that kind of thing
but yeah AMD has put anyone who is a
big-time AMD fan in a pretty difficult
situation right now where the only
practical graphics cards to invest in
are going to be like in the sub hundred
dollar range or right around that range
some super cheap stuff that's still
available or $400 plus and even $400
plus the only practical stuff is like a
gtx 1070 which you can actually get for
around $400 or gtx 1080 or gtx 980ti
because AMD's high-end options vega 56
and vega 64 are all grossly overpriced
pretty much everywhere you look and I
believe that is still the case as of
this morning
so I might actually direct my my answer
here to AMD rather than to fans of AMD
because AMD look at the situation that
this person is in eyeball guy the only
direct like like advice I could give to
you is unless you're ready to drop the
money on a freesync monitor right now a
freesync monitor and an overpriced vega
card might balance out to be somewhere
in the range of what you could also buy
a GTX 1080 and a g-sync monitor for that
are kind of equivalent I know that's
general again and there's lots of
specifics you could get in and say yes
or no but that's kind of what we're
looking at here if you're investing in
freesync
then maybe you could you could make the
justification to buy a vega cart if not
dude
drop the money on that 1080i because
it's significantly faster than a vega 64
and it's available and you can buy it
it's not ridiculously overpriced
compared to the MSRP that Nvidia
originally came out with it for so this
is where I think AMD is gonna suffer the
most in this current situation they're
gonna have fans who are really put in a
spot where they have no other practical
choice but to invest in the
competition's hardware and once they've
done that and tried it out and tested it
what's it gonna take to get them to go
back to AMD and I think that's the
biggest question right now but you know
that's gonna play out in the next few
months as we continue to watch the
prices of graphics cards and whatnot all
right what is your favorite PC you've
ever built asks the obsidian sword
I like your I like your avatar here -
all right so this made me think back on
many many pcs have built in the past I
of course have fond places in my heart
for all of them going all the way back
to the Hewlett Packard system that my
dad bought which I didn't really build
so I guess that one doesn't count but
point being there's lots of systems I've
used over the year that over the years
that I'm a little bit nostalgic for but
arctic panther i think has to take the
cake for this one I don't have them all
right here the the case is over there
here's the power supply it is continued
it's continuing to be a work in progress
originally built a little over two years
ago my first ever water cooling system
full water-cooled full loop water-cooled
system that I ever built with hard line
tubing did more case modding than I've
ever done with any system before I'm
still modding the case I just posted a
video I think yesterday where I added a
USB type-c port to my define our five so
yes it's it's gotta be arctic panther
it's just investment of time it's been a
lot of fun I've learned a ton of stuff
doing that build and I've definitely
gained a huge appreciation for the guys
who do like full custom mods all the
time because it's a huge labor of love
and I think I think yeah that pretty
much hopefully answers your question
final question
here from Alex Collins this one's a
little off-topic so bear bear with me
but hey Paul is it hold me closer tiny
dancer or holding me closer Tony Danza
or is it meant to be both these are the
questions that need answers in life and
Alex I'm happy to inform you that I'm
gonna be able to provide a definitive
answer to this question right now
now Elton John Sir Elton John forgive me
certain Elton Hercules John to be
specific came out with his hits classic
song tiny dancer in 1971 on the album
madman across the water now Elton John
hails from England he is English Tony
Danza a famous American actor and boxer
I was born in 1951 in Brooklyn New York
so at the time when Tony Danza when tiny
dancer came out Tony Danza would have
been about 20 years old
in 1971 now he actually got famous or
was originally known for his role in
taxi taxi as a TV series actually roll
was was on TV from 78 to 82 this is all
before my time in case you're wondering
by the way so based on all this I have
to say I'm gonna say it's tiny dancer
not Tony Danza I don't think Elton John
would have been aware of mr. danza's
work by that time although who knows
maybe maybe Tony went and took a trip to
England you know in his late teens and
met a young Elton John and maybe that
was where it was all sourced from I was
not able in my limited research to find
any definitive evidence of that however
so I'm gonna say tiny dancer that's what
I'm going with because that is all for
this sort of strangely ending episode of
probing Paul I hope you guys have
enjoyed it if you did hit the thumbs up
button and of course don't forget to
leave me some questions for nuts next
month I'll be perusing those very soon
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
