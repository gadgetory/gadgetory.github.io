could but I think it is finally time for
me to weigh in on the Verge's horrendous
how to build a PC tutorial video so I'm
going to try to keep this as short and
to the point as possible starting with a
recap of what happened for those of you
who are out of the loop then I'll talk
about my initial response as well as
some recent developments and finally
some commentary and handling criticism
as well as my just basic suggestions for
what maybe could have done to prevent
this mess that we're in right now so
let's start with what happened the verge
if you're not familiar is a tech news
website they also have a YouTube channel
and they posted a tutorial video on how
to build a $2,000 gaming PC back on
September 13th 2018 it was a tutorial
style video and it was also sponsored by
Capital One the video host was Stefan at
TN and he made numerous mistakes
throughout the video including but not
limited to an odd recommendation to use
a Swiss Army knife even though he still
used his screwdriver most of the video
he called cable ties tweezers he
correctly recommended using an
anti-static wrist band but then he broke
out one of these non conductive rubber
bracelets ribs strong he installed the
motherboard into the case before
installing the CPU into the motherboard
he installed the CPU cooler into the
case before installing the motherboard
into the case he installed the RAM in
the wrong Ram slot so it's not to take
advantage of dual channel memory mode he
said that's PCIe slot for your GPU
doesn't matter which it kind of doesn't
sometimes but it's always best to use
the top slot he forgets to install the
CPU cooler backplate he messed up the
CPU installation itself by putting a
plastic installation holder that came
with the motherboard but he put it under
the CPU clamp he should have just left
that out entirely the Oman cooler he was
using had pre applied thermal paste but
then he went and added more and added a
lot of it and added it not in the right
place on the CPU so that was just a big
mess he didn't put the fans on the CPU
radiator he use longer fan mounting
screws to mount his radiator to the case
which could have gone through the
radiator and damaged it he plugged all
the cables into his modular power supply
even though the point of having a
modular power supply is to only plug in
the cables that you need he said the
power supply needed to be installed on
dampening pads for electrical isolation
even though in fact the power supply
needs to be grounded to the case the
entire case is grounded to the PSU PSU
was installed backwards which blocked
the airflow and he pretty much had zero
cable management in the case despite
recommending using tweezers at the
beginning
zip ties so those were pretty much the
most egregious errors in the video the
video itself has been removed from
YouTube but if you type in the verge PC
build and look up on YouTube you can
find reuploads as well as a bunch of
response videos to that original video
all posted within the past four or five
months after September 14th these
response videos became quite numerous
online and a bunch of my YouTube friends
started posting well-deserved critiques
of the Virg video and the accompanying
article that went along with it Kyle
also known as bit wit posted a parody
video starring Lyle his alter ego and
there were other videos posted by Gregg
from science studio as well as tech yes
City Christopher he James two cents and
then a bunch of others that you can find
by searching on YouTube oh yeah and they
also quickly disabled likes and dislikes
as well as comments on the video which
is never a good sign for a video that
you've posted on YouTube that usually
you'd want some feedback on so they're
trying to hide the feedback and hide
their spots of this video and eventually
they just took it down so Internet
condemnation of the video was swift and
harsh to begin with I personally didn't
join in very much I just kind of felt
like there was a lot of piling on going
on whenever somebody on the internet is
wrong about something people like to
point it out and I'll also say I was
somewhat sympathetic to a tech youtuber
has posted a video on YouTube who is
getting bombarded from all angles with
criticisms of the video and the content
that they have produced I personally
started making YouTube videos about ten
years ago now and if you go and look at
the old Newegg videos from 2009 just go
to Newegg and sort by date added oldest
and you can see some of my initial
videos that I posted this is the very
very first one I think I had some
problems with the aspect ratio there you
can also see my original how to build a
PC tutorial which was posted in August
14th 2009 with horrible green screen and
I'll post links to those down in the
video's description point being I can
look back at those videos and remember
how cringe-worthy I was back then not
that I've improved too much but I know
how hard it is to go on camera to
present yourself for the world to see
and to feel that deep fear that you'll
screw up or get something wrong it's
often referred to as impostor syndrome
even now I try very hard and spend a lot
of time to make sure that all the
information I'm presenting in a youtube
video is true and accurate but I still
make plenty of mistakes we are all
fallible humans after all but apart from
the brief discussion that Cal and I had
during our weekly live show awesome
Hardware back when The Verge video first
went up I didn't really add much to the
criticism but now that some time has
gone by it's become clear that the verge
and the original create
the video never have really wanted to
take responsibility for many of the
clear mistakes that were made and
instead they've accused the Internet of
forgetting the video and responses to it
they've even gone so far as to claim
that the criticism was racially
motivated but now as of yesterday
February 12 2019 The Verge has issued a
copyright strike on Kyle's parody video
via Vox Media Incorporated even though
the original PC video from the verge was
taken down months ago now quickly I want
to point out the difference between a
copyright claim and a copyright strike
when it comes to YouTube videos a claim
is fairly easy to do for a company
trying to protect their intellectual
property and it's often automated
because YouTube has their Content ID
system that can automatically identify
copyrighted content it's also a bit more
of a minor infraction for YouTube
channel
they claimed video can either be removed
or it's more often left up and the ad
revenue from that claimed video just
goes to the claimants rather than the
channel owner who posted the video
originally the important thing is that
with a claim the channel status as well
as other videos on that channel aren't
affected a strike or copyright takedown
requires direct action from the
copyright owner the copyright takedown
requires the owner to submit a formal
notice to us with all the legal
requirements filled out according to
YouTube also you can't just remove a
strike by simply deleting the video a
strike can affect your channels ability
to monetize videos and can also disable
your ability to livestream for 90 days
so this affects me as well as Kyle I
mean Kyle's my friend I sympathize with
him he's in a bad situation right now
he's gonna have to get this worked out
through his MCM full screen but if I'm
speaking strictly selfishly that also
affects me because it's going to disrupt
our ability to do our live stream every
week but let's move on to the third
point I wanted to make here which is
about handling criticism how should the
response to this have gone I could spend
the rest of this video talking
about birds or Vox media and how petty
their actions have been and calling
their basic decency into question but
instead I will try to help by pointing
out three ways that they could have
fixed this and done better the first way
would have been to admit that they're
wrong that would have been a very simple
thing that they could have done very
early on now the article is still up on
this build on verge so you can still go
and read it and they did issue a
correction to it and they removed the
video from it
but the errors and omissions in this
supposed build guide definitely
warranted free
their action this wasn't just some typo
to be edited out some of the mistakes
like those radiator screws could
actually lead people to damage their
hardware in the future so it definitely
needed a bit more than just a correction
on the article the second way they could
have fixed this although it would have
required some foresight would have been
just to phrase the entire video
differently if you don't know how to do
something you can still make a video
about it people do that on YouTube all
the time you just need to indicate from
the get-go that you don't know what
you're doing and that you're learning as
you go their video probably would have
actually done better if it was titled
like we failed trying to build a $2,000
gaming PC people tend to learn from
others mistakes but the mistakes have to
be pointed out that their mistakes in
order for people to learn from them the
third thing that the verge could have
done at any point within the past five
months is to redeem themselves by
showing that they have some self
reflection what if they had reached out
to any one of the YouTube critics or
other critics and asked them to
collaborate on fixing the problem people
love a good comeback story and the
Internet is actually capable of
forgiving you sometimes if you display
genuine remorse of course a follow-up
video with the verge and then Jay or
Kyle humbly noting that man our first
video didn't go so well trying to teach
people how to build a computer but we
brought us some help to do it right and
let's do a collaboration and actually do
a good video this time I think that
would have turned the entire situation
around redeemed them shown positivity in
every way but instead they've gone this
method of issuing a copy strike against
Kyle's reaction video and remains to be
seen if they're going to do that to any
of the other reaction videos that I've
shown up there so that pretty much sums
up what I wanted to say about this
situation and if you think this is an
overreaction to the action that the
verge or Vox media has taken I'll
consider that as tech channels building
pcs is not just our hobby but it's also
the way we make a living if somebody has
a bad build experience due to a poorly
made tutorial
it could sour them on PC building as a
whole maybe they'll go tell our friends
about that and be like PC building sucks
everyone go buy Max or something Mac's
are fine not gonna get into that debate
right now but the point is we don't want
anyone to have a bad experience building
a PC and a poorly made tutorial is not
gonna help that in one bit so to sum up
everyone makes mistakes but your
character is represented by how you
handle those mistakes admitting you're
wrong and doing what you can to correct
the situation is the right thing to do
playing the victim claiming the mistakes
never happened making excuses and
especially attempting to censor or
silence
your critics will only make things worse
let's give the Virg one more chance just
just browsing through their recent
articles see if there's anything related
to the topic I've been discussing today
and oh look now for some reason Capital
One decided not to sponsor this tutorial</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
