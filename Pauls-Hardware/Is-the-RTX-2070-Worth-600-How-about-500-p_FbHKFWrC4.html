link in the video's description hello
everyone and welcome to my GeForce r-tx
2070 launch review video here you will
find some benchmarks and some testing
results for these new GPUs with
comparisons to the r-tx 20 80 and 20 80
TI
as well as the gtx 980ti gtx 1080 and
AMD Radeon Vegas 64 I tested in 4k 1440
and 1080 so feel free to jump forward in
this video to this timecode and you can
watch those immediately but if you're
gonna stick with me for a few moments I
do have a few things to point out about
this launch here is the founders Edition
r-tx 2070 you might note that these are
just still images because I do not
actually have this GPU in hand I do have
the founders editions of the 2080 and
2080 TI which Nvidia provided to us for
viewers when those launched but the
founders Edition 27 TS are supposed to
cost $600 whereas the entry-level price
for an RT X 27 T is $500 NVIDIA hasn't
sampled any of the founders Edition
cards to the press to my knowledge at
least so what you're gonna see today
from myself as well as other viewers is
eerily similar videos where anyone who's
reviewing a higher-end card like this
MSI RT X 2070 gaming Z will also be
required to cover a $500 version of this
card like the msi RT X 2070 armor and
everyone will be using aftermarket GPUs
rather than Founders editions I think
NVIDIA made this decision for a very
specific purpose and that is to make
sure that as we reviewers are showing
you price to performance graphs we will
take the $500 price into consideration
as opposed to only talking about the
higher end price for the founders
Edition like we did with the arc GX 20
ATT I launched most reviewers for that
launch myself included use the founders
Edition price of $1200 to show the value
proposition because that's supposedly
what you can actually buy one for at
least if you can find a 20 atti in stock
for what it's worth though today I
tested both of these cards so I will be
sharing bow
sets of numbers the overclock from the
manufacturer gaming Z as well as the
base clock set of numbers from the armor
I did want to point out this requirement
though because we actually rarely get
rules or restrictions placed on how we
do reviews as independent review outlets
so this was a different way of doing
things from my experience with Nvidia in
the past if the upshot is that there are
actually Archie X xx 70s widely
available for $500 on the retail launch
day which is in two days on the 18th I'm
okay with it but we will have to wait
and see if that is actually the case
either way I wanted to let you guys know
what's going on let's quickly cover some
of the basic stats for the RT X 2070
though if you watch the 20 80 and 20
atti launch then you'll probably already
be familiar with some of the tech the RT
X 2070 is based on the tu 106 GPU for
Nvidia which is built on touring
architecture that means it features
tensor cores for hardware based AI
acceleration and now also rate racing or
RT cores for hardware accelerated
real-time rate racing given the timing
of this launch which is the same week
that the Intel 99 K launches if you guys
didn't notice and the lack of software
that actually supports these new
technologies as far as demonstrating and
benchmarking them I will not be testing
AI R rate racing today instead focusing
on my gaming comparison tests that I
used for the 28th ETI launch and showing
you how these cards stack up in those
tests we should see a benefit in my
testing from the Turing architectural
change to an independent integer data
path though which allows integer and
floating-point operations to run
concurrently which should boost
asynchronous compute performance more
specifically though when compared to the
RT X 2080
the RT X 2070 has 2304 cuda cores versus
the 2080s 2944 it still has the same 8
gigabyte configuration of 14 gigabits
per second GD dr6 memory on a 256 bit
bus and it does have a TDP that's a bit
lower at 175 watts for the standard
edition 185 watts for the founders
Edition versus the 28 est DPS of 215 and
225 watts for the standard and founders
Edition one last thing I wanted to say
before we get into the benchmarks is
that the - 7 D GPUs from Nvidia have for
a very long time been in the 350 to 450
dollar range with great bang for the
buck performance and a worthy entry to
the high end GPU market range that could
you could claw your way up to buy
your pennies even if you didn't have
that much money to work with
but they're just not any more 500 to 600
dollars is a big jump in base price and
while there may be some justification
from invidious point of view due to lack
of competition from radion it just kind
of sucks that this card is so much less
accessible to so many potential PC
builders due to the price increase
especially when you compare it to the
place in the market that the GTX 970 and
gtx 1070 set at so if you look at these
prices and you don't want that thought
to depress you you just have to kind of
remind yourself that the 2070 is more of
a replacement for the gtx 1080
not the gtx 1070 and i don't really see
that changing until we have new high end
graphics cards from AMD to compete with
these onto the benchmarks though and due
to extreme lack of time this week i'm
using my existing 20 ATT i launch review
suite of software and games and
benchmark results that you can play
right now and these include a mix of
DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 titles a test
system that I am using is right here and
it is fairly small it's got an Intel
Core i7 8700 k-6 core 12 threads CPU at
4.6 gigahertz with a 4.8 gigahertz turbo
on one or two cores at once
Nasus ROG Strix is e 370 - I gaming
motherboard which is small but powerful
a G scale flare X kits of 16 gigabytes
of ddr4 memory 2 by 8 gigs
that's running at casa latency 14 and
i've got a crier rig h7 cpu cooler on
top with two noctua NF a 12 X 25 PWM
fans 120-millimeter fans and push-pull
and then for storage I mean SSD
operating system drive is a samsung 960
pro nvme m2 512 gig SSD my comparison
cards are the asus rog Strix gtx 980ti
11 gig overclocked version the asus rog
Strix Radeon Vegas 64 8 gigs of HBM - on
that one also overclocked and the EVGA
GTX 10 80 for the win - which has gddr5
X and us also manufacturer overclocked
and now let's take a look at the
benchmarking numbers themselves the key
comparison here I think is going to be
between the RT X 2070 and the GT x 1080
since those are supposedly around the
same price when it comes to what's
available right now I first s here is 3d
mark firestrike ultra 4k tests and here
we have an overall score as well as the
graphics score the graphics score is
probably a little bit
more important and here I want to point
out the big jump that the gaming Z gets
and that's due to the frequency that
it's getting at we'll talk about that
when we get to the end of the benchmarks
numbers but got a nice 500-point boost
here and that allowed it to catch up to
and overtake the 1080 for the win - next
up is 3dmark times pi this is a DirectX
12 test and here I think we can see the
asynchronous compute performance of the
new twenty series actually showing
through as even the base clock version
scored 83 92 in the graphics test which
is a nice boost up over the overclock to
GT X 1080 score of 75 76 also worth
noting that while these numbers are
pretty impressive compared to the Vegas
64 and the GTX 1080
it's still well back of the 1080 Ti as
well as the 2080 and 2080 TI's
performance next up is VR mark blue room
a VR specific test and here the 27 t
both the armor and gaming Z performed
very well
scoring 2600 and 3,000 respectively a
very nice jump up over the GTX 1084 the
win to VR can provide a unique challenge
to some GPUs depending on the software
being tested of course but it's nice to
see the 20 series excelling in this test
next is ashes of the singularity
escalation also DirectX 12
affectionately known as ashes of the
benchmark because no one actually plays
this game it's only used for benchmarks
but still a good test and we can see
that with the overclocked speed of the
MSI gaming Z it was able to catch up to
and overtake the 1080 for the win - and
here's where we can see that where the
Eternity does win actually it might be
just a clock speed differential there
and by overclocking at 2070 you can
catch up moving over to 2560 by 1440 and
we have a dead heat between the 2070 MSI
gaming Z and the EVGA GTX 1080 for the
1/2 they scored exactly the same which
is rare but that shows you that in some
tests were pretty much evenly matched
between these two cards and then finally
for 1920 by 1080 we do see the GTX 1080
for the win - pulling ahead but it's
really just by about 1 frame per second
our next test is rise of the Tomb Raider
this is our last DirectX 12 test and I'm
not using shadow of the Tomb Raider just
yet but it will switch to that soon at
4k the 2070 gaming Z wins once again
with an average frame rate of 47 fps
that beats up to 1080 for the 1/2 with a
frame rate of 40 point 8 although again
both of these cards are staying well
behind the 1080 TI so if you are
considering a higher ends $600 +
twenty seventy then the ten atti becomes
even more of a compelling alternative at
2560 by 1440 the lead increases even
more with a average frame rate of eighty
nine point eight frames per second for
the 2070 gaming Z and then finally at
1920 by 1080 we do become a little bit
more CPU bound so it does even add a
little bit more about once again the
gaming Z wins with a hundred and twenty
nine point three next up is GTA v
testing in 4k at 3840 by 2160 the 2070
MSI gaming Z comes in at 65 frames per
second the armor dropping in at 61 fps
just a little bit behind and then the
1080 for the 1/2 coming in with 56
frames per second if we jump over to
1440 it evens out just a little bit but
the gaming Z wins once again with an
average frame rate of about 21 frames
per second again we're still behind the
1080 TI and 2080 founders Edition which
are up in the 140 FPS range but if we
move over to 1920 by 1080 everything
evens out as we become a little bit more
CPU bound and we're all scoring around
150 frames per second here's total war
Warhammer to at 4k we are running the
campaign benchmarking sequence and the
27t armor in gaming Zr within a few
frames of each other at 44 and 41 frames
per second respectively again this is
still well behind the 20 80 and 20 atti
but just edges out the GTX 1080 for the
win - at 2560 by 1440 we have more of
the same with an average frame rate of
75 frames per seconds for the MSI gaming
Z r-tx 2070 is still well behind again
the max score of the 20 atti founder's
Edition which got up to 113 so you do
still get a nice boost from the 28 ETI
here of course it does cost twice as
much so I guess you get what you pay for
at 1920 by 1080 we again have the
overall frame rates evening out just a
little bit as at lower resolutions we do
become a little bit more CPU bound
battlefield 1 is next at 4k we were
getting 66 average frames per second
with the MSI gaming Z so well over 60
frames per second even the 1% lows we're
only at 56 so if you're on a standard 4k
60 Hertz monitor the 2070 should get you
by with battlefield 1 moving over to
2560 by 1440 we have a hundred and 20
average frames per second so maybe a
1440 high refresh rate monitor is also a
nice pairing for an RT X 2070 at least
on a slightly better budget than the RT
X 2080 and then finally at 1920 by 1080
we
159 average frames per second 151
average frames per second for the
slightly lower clocked msi armor RTX 20
70 and both of these again beat out the
1080 for the wind to our final test is
overwatch and this is on epic settings
with 100% render scale remember
overwatch has a lot of scaling and
graphics options so you can get better
frame rates than what I'm showing you
here with these graphics cards by just
tweaking those a little bit but if you
want the maximum eye candy you'll get
about 82 frames per second at 4k with an
overclocked r-tx 2070 such as the MSI
gaming Z if you jump to 2560 by 1440
this is actually a great solution again
for a high refresh rate monitor such as
a 120 Hertz 144 Hertz option you're
getting a hundred and 60 average frames
per second and only dipping down to a
hundred and thirty-eight for the 1% lows
and finally if you want max frame rates
you're getting about 220 to 240 frames
per second with an RT X 2070 depending
on the clock speed of course here that's
still well below but you can get with a
maxed out 2080 founders Edition or a
1080 TI for example but still well over
what you would need for any reasonably
specs high refresh rate 1920 by 1080
monitor here's a chart comparing the
frequencies of the different GPUs as
testing the base and boost clock as
listed from the manufacturer as well as
the max testing frequency and then the
average testing frequency while the GPU
is under load and actually had some heat
built up in it so you can actually see a
really big jump from the msi armor to
the MSI gaming Z here going from that
boosts clock of 1620 with the armor all
the way up to 1830 over 200 megahertz
boost with the gaming Z that is
potentially something you could do on
your own I'm not overclocking in this
video here but MSI makes afterburner
overclocking software and you should be
able to go in and just turn up the GPU
frequency of this card here you might be
limited based on the performance of the
cooler or the ASIC quality of the GPU
itself but it is worth noting that if
you're willing to do a little bit of
overclocking you can save yourself a
hundred bucks overclock this GPU and
probably get a lot closer to the
performance of this GPU here that said
and something I'm not sure about but
hopefully we'll be covering gray soon in
the future I'm not sure if there are
actually different GPUs for the base
frequency versions of these that are not
allowed to be a manufacturer overclocked
and
the manufacturer overclocked versions
and if there's any significant ASIC
quality between those that would
indicate that yes you do need to spend
more if you want to get max frequency or
yes you can spend less and just
overclock this and get yourself if not
the same frequency something that's in
the ballpark
I don't get too distracted with that
though because I didn't actually
overclock these for right now so let's
just talk about the frequencies they're
running at the gaming Z hit 1995
megahertz max frequency whereas the
armorer hit 1860 over a hundred
megahertz less and then the actual
frequency that they were running at was
about 1950 so pretty close to two
gigahertz on the gaming Z and then 1710
on the armorer
so as I mentioned at the beginning of
the video you'll notice a pretty big
jump in performance with the gaming Z
but you could easily narrow that gap
with the armor by taking it and
overclocking it a little bit I just
can't speak to how good of an
overclocker these base level cards are
when it comes to power draw though you
actually do draw a decent amount more
power when you're running at the higher
frequency we saw an average power drop
274 watts with the armor whereas that
average jumped up about 50 watts at 328
was the gaming Z so you do lose a little
bit of efficiency there and trade-off
for the added performance and then
finally for temperatures the coolers did
seem to do a pretty good job we hit 68
degrees Celsius max on the armor and 69
degrees Celsius max on the gaming Z so I
would also indicate the both of these
cards have some potential overclocking
Headroom in the future especially the
armor and finally here's the money shot
the TLDR slide for those of you who just
want the overall performance this is it
weighted against the GTX 1080 or using
that as a baseline with 100% of z-score
we have 103 percent performance from the
r-tx 2070 msi armor and then 10 percent
more with the 2070 MSI gaming Z and then
up from there the 2080 is 27% faster and
so on also here you can see the prices
that I've chosen for these cards which I
tried to base on prices that are
currently available for cards that are
roughly the same ballpark as the ones I
was testing and here if we're looking at
price versus performance we can see the
standouts are gonna be the GTX 1080 and
then the $500 version of the r-tx 2070
$600 version is still on there too but
it is kind of outshined by it's less
expensive little girl
and finally just to boil things way down
I took the performance and the price and
I did a little math and I came out with
the points per dollar number here so 200
points is what your 1084 500 bucks gets
and here we can see that the 27 TMSI
armor is giving us just a little bit
more value with 206 points gtx ten atti
is also a standout with 191 so that's
showing that even with the price still
at 700 dollars the ten atti is still
coming out as a value proposition
amongst this batch of high end graphics
cards going further down the list we can
see we lose more and more value as we go
to the 2070 the Vegas 64 and then of
course the 2080 and 28 eti so ultimately
the closest competitor of the r-tx 2070
is well not the r-tx 2080 that is the
gtx 1080 and the gtx nae has been all
over the place in terms of pricing so
please bear in mind for my price to
performance numbers there things do
fluctuate so I can't account for all of
that but the fact is if the our TX 2070
was launching at the same price or even
the ballpark same price as the gtx 1070
launched at two years ago which was $400
maybe a little over $400 I'd be telling
everyone to buy this card it's what you
want it's got stuff for the future
technology ray-tracing and everything
even though we can't test that yet I'd
be like we'll buy it because it's a good
value and then you'll have that
technology once the software becomes
made available for it at the price of
500 or $600 it becomes so much more
muddied and so much more confusing to
try to give you guys good advice on what
you should do and in fact it becomes
much more of the same story that we told
with the RT X 2080 when it launched
which is this is insanely overpriced and
you have to very seriously consider a 10
80 TI by comparison and what that costs
speaking of cost just somewhat
anecdotally for this video here is what
you can get a 10 80 TI for right now
around $700 that's still pretty
expensive and those prices have come
back up from what they were before if
you're looking at the gtx 1070 or ten 70
TI well though start at three hundred
and sixty dollars ten seventy TI you can
get for three hundred and eighty-five
dollars and the cheapest ten eighty I
found was only four hundred and forty
dollars to be fair he is also a look at
Radeon
8:56 --is which are currently starting
around 420 to 440 dollars vega 64's
started $500 but ultimately this it's
just a very difficult recommendation to
make I think right now so I will say
with the prices of the GTX 10 70s that's
probably still my go to right now for a
nice balance of excellent performance as
well as a price that isn't going to take
you up into the $600 plus range the 2070
is a viable option and it's maybe a
little bit more of a viable price to
performance option than say the 2080 is
but it's still very expensive and I'd
say you still are having to rely a
little bit on that potential future
performance of ray tracing and AI which
you can't really validate for sure right
now so I think the final question is
going to be for these entry-level $500
versions of the cards that the
manufacturers cannot ship to you
manufacturer overclocked how will they
overclock is it really going to be held
back very much is there a significant
difference between the ASIC quality of
the overclock from the manufacturer
versions and the entry-level versions
and that information is information I do
not have to share with you right now and
even if I did it would be somewhat
anecdotal because I only have one of
these to test but I'll come back to that
in the future I think for now you do get
all-around solid performance with the RT
X 2070 definitely an edge up versus the
GTX 1080 and DirectX 12 titles as well
as VR and 4k gaming but only slights and
maybe not significant enough to warrant
the higher price especially when it can
get GTX 1080s for 450 bucks right now
that's all have to say for this video
guys I hope you enjoyed it and
definitely thumbs up button if you did
and also subscribe because I got more
videos coming at you very soon I'm
actually immediately going right now to
start or continue testing on the 9900 K
so I should have a video up for you guys
on that very soon and that's all I have
for now thank you for watching guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
