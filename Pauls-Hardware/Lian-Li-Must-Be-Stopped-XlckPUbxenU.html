to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake alright guys I
made my way back over to lammle and
behind me you'll probably see the
streamer they have been working on this
they've been improving it and in fact
they're actually going to wash it in q3
of this year and it's expected to be
around 35 to 50 dollars so much for
exactly on the price but we'll probably
find out soon it actually showed me a
demo version of this where they've
improved some of the bracket mounts that
they're going with they've removed the
screws on them to give it a bit cleaner
look also separate things out so all
those little lines being cleaner
separated and they won't look like
they're wiggling around at all an update
that we're seeing at the show right now
though is the addition of a plan and PCI
Express graphics connectors these are
something that I suggested are probably
along the way these are still in
development so they're probably gonna
take a little bit longer to get out than
a 24-pin what they're working on right
now is making sure that the light source
down here is going to extend all the way
up to the end because it then does tend
to fade a little bit once it gets up
towards the top but its project is still
in development on and I will bring you
more on it when it is available and you
can get your rainbow Power PC every good
here's the LAN leave PC zero-one-one
dynamic and these have already been out
for a while these are some of the most
low reviewed cases I think in the past
six months to a year and they've
actually got the new version of it right
over here here it is the Razer edition
of these 0:11 dynamics so they were kind
of Razer prices still TBD on this one
it's probably going to be a little bit
more than the standard edition because
you know adding a Razer logo does cost
money but they've added some accent
lighting RGB going down the front here
as well as some under glow RGB effects
other than that it's pretty much the
same design and features of the Olav and
dynamics so if you're familiar with that
this would be very similar here's a mod
they're showcasing of the OU 11 dynamic
this one has actually been directly
modified so they could rotate the
motherboard tray in order to make it
vertical rather than horizontal they've
also added a reservoir here on the front
with an nvidia logo and an interesting
liquid cooling solution inside just with
the CPU but it's got actually internal
radiators which are kinda cool looking
before I don't know where they come from
but they're cool lookit so I thought I'd
share with you well let's move on to
some actual new upcoming cases from Lee
Ann Lee this is the zero eleven air and
then over here we have the zero eleven
air RGB so you're looking at a $129
price for the O 11 air and $150 price
for the 11 air RGB
this one is going to come with two 120
millimeter fans so that the one over on
the right will come with 320 millimeter
RGB fans so there's part of your upgrade
there ask them to get inside the case so
the top panel is pretty easy to remove
it just slides back a little bit and
then it can be removed and that's
actually also how you remove the side
panel so you gotta remove the top to get
to the side panel but the result is that
you have a really really clean edge
along here as well as no visible
mounting points it's held on by magnets
on the back and there's also some
rubberized material around the edge just
to make sure there's no vibration or
rattling from stuff moving around in the
case now there's a reason they're
calling this the air and that's because
it can fit a pretty nice amount of fans
for a case this size in fact twelve so
let's count one two three four five six
seven eight nine and then 10 11 12 long
the top plus 13 14 since there are 280
millimeter exhaust fans there at the
back that's a lot of air pillow for
anyone who's interested in airflow one
thing I really like that Lian Li is
doing is including type-c on most of
these cases or at least the ability to
add type-c in the future if you want so
you got a couple USB 3.0 you got that
type-c removing the front panel is
slightly more difficult because there
are two screws that are holding it in on
top so you do have to remove those in
order to get the front panel off but
behind that there is a removable dust
filter so you can easily clean out the
dust other than all those fan mounts
though the internal layout is pretty
open which means it supports up to EHT
exercise motherboards and lots of room
for activities so I imagine we're going
to see lots of cool setups in this like
water cooling builds for example like
they have set up right over here
I think one of the reasons Leon lien has
gained a lot of popularity recently is
that they've steered away from their old
mo of making fairly expensive aluminum
based jassi's that were just often
fairly expensive and well well built
some well designed but we're very
expensive so here's an example of them
continuing to make cases that are in a
price range that we can afford this is a
$90 case it's the land cool one and then
there's also the lane cool one that's a
digital RGB over there
only a $10 price difference between
these 90 bucks for this 100 bucks for
that one other than the fact that the
one on the right
has addressable RGB s on the front so
you can get fancier with your RGB FX it
also includes a type C port up on the
top this one also has a type C slot so
if you get one of those type C extension
cables like I used gosh like eight
months ago when I upgraded arctic
panther with type C you could add that
in the future and again it's just like
having that on there and the bracket
will allow you to screw it in and you
won't have to do any crazy modding in
order to get that installed or if you
know you want the type C from the get-go
just get these digitally addressable one
and it comes with it installed in my
opinion that's maybe even a better
upgrade than the addressable RGB so at
least slightly more practical the LAN
cold one also has a removable top panel
and under there you can get at a dust
filter it easily pops off from the back
just a couple thumb screws hold on the
tempered glass side panel and that's
fairly easy to remove as well as a power
supply basement done at the bottom and
it's got a couple metal panels on top of
that those will store SSDs and you can
remove them if you're not going to put
SSDs down there or if you want a little
bit more room for a 2-way SLI setup you
can just pop those off and then that
also opens up a lot more airflow from
the bottom of the case around the back
you have plenty of room for cable
management they have cable grommets
installed there as well and a couple
more SSD trays there tucked away over to
the left but you can remove those and
move them over to the right and there's
a couple more mounting points for that
just below the CPU backplate cutout on
the motherboard tray now my main
question for this case was how to get at
the dust filter on the Front's it does
seem like it is a little bit more work
to get that off but there is a dust
filter just behind this panel right here
so I will collect us maybe something
you're only going to clean out every few
months but that is removable eventually
and then other than that USB type-c port
up here you also got a power button and
LED control button and then a couple
more USB 3.0 ports and finally here is a
PC chassis / vert desk with the tempered
glass top piece Liam Lee has actually
made a dual system version of this
before they've shrunk it down a little
bit made a little bit smaller made it a
little bit more affordable it's still
going to cost you $1000 the fair mine
this is not just a computer case it's
also furniture clothes a nice clean
tabletop plenty of room in there for an
epic water-cooled build as you can see
they got a bits power system in there
with a triple fan radiator going and
that's just looking quite sexy with the
RGB
ladies because this is a desk there's
plenty of room inside for activities in
water cooling up here they have a 360
rad mounted but that can actually
support up to a 420 millimeter radiator
depending on the orientation of the fans
you want to point them at you if you
live somewhere where it's cold right
then it'll give you a nice warm air
right right down onto your lap or you
rotate them and then it can pull air in
and you won't get warm if you live
somewhere where it's warm it's also a
240 or 280 millimeter radiator mounting
point at the back and then another 120
right there the guys that's gonna wrap
it up for my coverage here at the Leon
Lee booth at Computex 2018 they got some
epic new stuff so check it out most of
the stuffs coming out in q3 of this year
but I'll hopefully be bringing you more
coverage of that in the future in the
meantime the big thank you to my
sponsors for coputex 2018 gigabytes
coolermaster Thermaltake and teen group
and thank you to you guys for watching
this video hit the thumbs up button if
you enjoyed it and subscribe because I
do still have more Computex videos
coming very soon
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
