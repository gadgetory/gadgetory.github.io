the description what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware this is my follow
up tesla powerwall and solar video where
I am actually gonna be turning the
system on for the first time I should
start off by apologizing to you guys I'm
kind of Shaggy and unkempt I'm also
fairly jet-lagged it's Monday morning
right now and I just got back this
weekend from two weeks or so in Japan
and Taiwan so the jet lag is very real
but somewhat ironically I got permission
to operate pretty quickly from Southern
California Edison after they did the
final inspection the downside was we got
permission to operate the day we left
for Japan so is May 25th and we're like
at the airport we got the email and I
was like oh it's too bad I'm not home to
turn my solar system on because then it
could be sucking up juice while we're
gone and giving us a credit or charging
the powerwall but all that is to say
though I'm turning it on today for the
first time I'm gonna walk you guys
through the steps and we'll see how
things go under stuff why there are some
devices I need to connect up like this
home gateway that allows the system to
connect back to Tesla so can report
usage data as well as potential outages
I do have some concerns about Internet
of Things connected devices that might
phone home they're connected to my
network for now though it's a bright
sunny day here in Southern California
it's supposed to be in the low 90s
Fahrenheit temperature wise that's about
33 or 30 34 degrees Celsius so step one
is going to be to set up the gateway
step two is going to be to turn
everything off and then step three is
going to be to turn it back on with the
power wall and the solar integrated that
was pretty simple that power connected
as well as you thin it and right now we
got no server and no signal but I think
I need to pop up an app now to connect
to this it does seem to have internet
though it said no internet just a second
ago okay got the app up and running at
saying connection error no current data
right now does it seem to indicate they
have solar though so that's good I think
this is probably because the Gateway
outside is off so let's go and switch
that stuff on that glorious sunlight
being wasted right now it's serving no
purpose
let's change that only real difference
from last time I showed this to you guys
was that they came and patched this
whole area up and did a bit of paint
matching so it's good enough I suppose
and unfortunately when Jerry was here he
gave me instructions on properly turning
the system off and back on so they're
supposed to be switches in here
oh yeah the sub panel is what I want so
this is explaining why we're not getting
any connection it's just a battery and
the solar have been off just to be on
the safe side I'm switching everything
else off right now Oh probably not
necessary to do that but you know looks
like the power wall is already off as
well so I don't need to switch that off
and finally main breaker also off okay
like everything is now off so if I'm
reading this rate I want to do the
breakers on first on the sub panel
that's right there and I need to turn on
the external disconnect which I don't
believe is an issue and then I turn on
the inverter which is over there let's
give this a shot
this pair was off
battery solar then I think we can do
this next I hope I don't think the AC
should matter cuz it's not on right now
gateway lane i hear beeps in science
that's how its back on yeah now do you
see this connect on position on the
battery it's the power wall it made a
noise well attempt one scene was
unsuccessful we still have no connection
so I'm gonna have to mess her on this
app and see what I can figure out that's
on the plus side of the inverter over
here we can't see power is on you can
also see that the panels are working
even though it's morning we're getting a
little over 3,000 watts out of them
right now to about a 5,000 watt system
overall so that's not bad it's also
showing us how many watt hours we've
accumulated for the day I'm still not
getting as proper connection from the
Gateway here so I think I'm gonna make
use of this recessed reset button right
there
seems user serviceable enough right
elated me they were poking into
electrical box make sure to use
something non conductive I usually hold
in reset buttons for 5 to 20 seconds all
right I think I made some progress
because we can now see the actual output
3.7 kilowatts from the solar array so I
think I got the solar array properly
communicating back to the home server
and delivering information to the app
this I don't think is working properly
because the light hasn't turned green
lights supposed to turn green once
everything's good to go although it does
seem to have an internet connection so I
don't think anything is really wrong
there I have emailed Tesla with the
present situation to see what's helped
they can provide in the meantime though
because I like to do things myself and I
want to get this running I've decided to
make the bold choice to RTFM we do have
a parallel manual here there is a
troubleshooting section in here where it
goes over what to do with the power wall
and the backup gateway are not
communicating with the server this glia
it's a glorified turn it off and back on
again so let's go through this and see
if I can get it fixed I'm really not
sure if you guys can see this but there
is
a green LED that runs down right here
this is the power wall indicator and it
is pulsing which I believe according to
the manual means it is charging right
now but a connection to the Gateway
means we can't see how much it's charged
or how the whole system is operating but
step one here is turn the switch off
done
step two turn off the AC breaker to the
power wall that's the battery then step
three is to turn off the breaker for the
Gateway which sometimes is part of the
Gateway but I don't have one exposed
there so I'm pretty sure that's this one
here fingers crossed now I wait for one
minute this is remarkably similar to
resetting a router I think it's been a
minute or two and the backup gateway
actually just physically made a noise so
and assume that means that we're good to
go switch stuff back on battery little
jingling noise just a second ago and
power well back up one thing that wasn't
completely sealed up as this pastor here
this is where the ground wire goes
through from the back the house to the
front should be grills on this just
gonna use some foam sealant to fill that
and make sure no critters get yet it
should do the trick so ultimately my
troubleshooting attempts were not
successful and that was because the two
devices the power wall and the Gateway
were not actually registered to my Tesla
account so the next day I decided to
call Tesla directly their support number
that's listed in the documentation
I talked to Dee she was very friendly
and helpful and she sort of talked me
through this process I need to get the
serial numbers from the power wall and
the Gateway I needed to plug those into
the website and that associated
everything with my account so after that
was done everything started working and
Dee stayed on the phone with me and her
to make sure that the Tesla app was
actually functional as well and once
everything's up and running the app is
really sort of your home base for taking
a look at the system seeing how it's
working seeing how much power you have
stored how much power you're using how
much power is being generated by the
solar and the first thing that I needed
to do was actually go into the customize
button because
you can customize your power wall and
tell it how you want it to behave my
power wall had actually defaulted to
backup only mode which means it will
charge itself up and then it will sit
and do nothing unless the power actually
goes out and then you can have that as a
battery backup for your home that's not
how I wanted to use it though so I
switched over to self powered and
self-care mode you can tell it to
reserve a certain amount for power
outages I originally had this set to 15
percent then I dropped it down to 10
percent which is what Tesla recommends
this is just telling the power wall to
reserve that much power in case of a
power outage the way I have it set it
can use up to 90 percent of the power
walls storage juice while it's not being
charged by the solar now the interesting
part of the app is definitely going to
be the power flow grid and this is where
it will actually show you your solar
your grid your home and your power wall
depending on what's currently being used
I switch over to the energy usage chart
here and this will actually give you a
graph of how much power is being
generated used in everything and you can
turn off all of these individually so
for example if you just want to look at
how much power your home is drawing you
can turn everything off your home and
it'll tell you how much power your home
has drawn for the day so right now I've
used 4.8 kilowatt hours for the course
of the day today it also has the time
down at the bottom so you can sort of
see throughout the day how things
proceed now I find that our home is
drawing about 200 to 400 watts at any
given time that's assuming we're not
cooking anything and a/c is not on it'll
go up and down during the day you can
see little bumps along that actual usage
meter as that goes up and down so like
if the refrigerator cycles on for
example or if you have devices that are
charging that charge themselves
Instructor drop power and then you see
little spikes going in there as things
happen so let me walk you through a
typical day and I'm gonna take a look at
yesterday and not only that I record
some stuff yesterday but I also recorded
this guy yesterday and right now it's
June and here in Southern California we
have something called June gloom which
means in the mornings I actually get a
marine layer of clouds that kind of
comes over and gives you some nice cool
weather if you're only interested in
that but does block the sunlight so
yesterday morning for example in the
morning in particular you can see that
the solar generation is really not all
there I mean normally on a completely
sunny day I would see a nice even arc
going up from the morning time when the
solar panels first start to get light
getting more direct sunlight throughout
the day peaking for me
about noonish and then it sort of falls
off for the rest of the day as the Sun
moves across the sky and we get less
direct sunlight across the solar panels
clouds are now evil and I hate them and
they block the Sun and prevent me from
getting power but but even with that
sort of not the best power generation
because of the clouds I was able to
still charge the power all up by about
noon and if I remove the solar here you
can see the power wall was powering the
house up until about seven or eight in
the morning and then it switches back to
the power wall being charged once there
is enough solar to charge the power wall
once the power wall is charged up is
when the grid starts taking into effect
so the grid is the white bar on here and
the idea for the grid is that I should
never have a positive it should never be
going up on the line above the grid
because I should either be running on
the solar or I should be running on the
power wall and from my experience this
past week I have been charging the power
wall in the morning and then once the
power wall is charged up it starts
feeding that power back to the grid and
for that I will get a credit which was
gonna be pretty nice now from the very
beginning of this process from when I
first signed up and put my deposit for
the tesla powerwall back in 2017 I've
been planning sort of a contained
beginning to end video of this entire
process rather than the sort of
piecemeal but at a time videos I've been
posting over the past month or so I am
still planning to do that video but
probably not for another month or so
because I need to get power bill back so
I can serve look at the rate it's
charging me and give you guys a bit more
analysis of that and that video is gonna
be sort of a lot of the stuff that I've
gone over up till now
condensed down to be a little bit more
palatable I'm also hopefully gonna get
some more feedback from Tesla on certain
questions so if you guys have any
questions for me stuff that maybe I
haven't addressed up till now or just
general questions about the power wall
or the solar definitely leave those in
the comments section and I will attempt
to address them in that final video
today it's been nice and sunny so far so
right now I'm getting four point eight
kilowatts at about just before 11 a.m.
so near full capacity that the potential
5,000 watts that my system should be
able to output I am considering going up
there and maybe cleaning them off a
little bit they said that you can just
wait for rain to clean them but you
might want to hose them down a little
bits in between if they start getting
dusty because as we know from the
Martian dust and sand that builds up on
your solar panels must be cleaned in
order for you
get power from them I still need to do
some more testing on what I actually do
here during the day for example so if
I'm shooting a video in the garage and I
have all the lights on I did do a
livestream earlier this week and that
was only drawing about eleven or twelve
hundred watts for them from the entire
production so that's actually pretty
good the solar was able to cover that
and also still be feeding power back to
the grid and I will also say that pretty
much every night the power wall has had
enough juice to provide us power during
the evening as well as throughout the
nights most of the time in the morning I
woke up with between twenty and thirty
percent of a charge still left on the
power wall and of course that gets
recharged pretty quickly on the
performance tab you can see if you have
been self powered or not and that's the
idea is to not use anything from the
grid so you can see here for today we're
98% self powered so far look at
yesterday we got to 99 percent so doing
pretty well with that with the trade-off
between the power wall and the solar and
actually for this entire week we're 96%
self powered although that's including
June 19th which hasn't finished yet if I
want to maintain that self powered
performance as the summer progresses
it's definitely going to be the
afternoons that become a potential issue
as the solar generation drops off when
the AC goes on is when my usage jumps up
to two to three thousand watts for the
entire house and there especially in the
afternoon the solar can't keep up with
it so starts dipping into the power wall
usage originally I thought the power
wall wasn't gonna be able to back up the
AC but that does seem to be the case I
have a theory on that in just a second
but the main point being the further
into the evening we need to use the AC
if it hasn't cooled off and it
definitely will get hot even in the
evenings later in the summer as it gets
up into the 90s and 100's here in
Southern California but when that
happens it might draw too much juice
from the power wall so that it doesn't
have enough left over to power us for
the rest of the nights then it might
have to switch to the grid before the
Sun comes up the next morning to charge
the power wall back up to sort of combat
that and I know this kind of goes
against my scientific a be comparisons
of pre solar and power wall to post I
have tried to figure out ways that I can
save power in the mean time so I've
added this little switch down here this
is just for the home theater area but I
might apply this practice elsewhere in
the house too so stuff that might draw
power on
and I like the subwoofer the receiver
the Xbox that we almost never use unless
we want to watch a 4k blu-ray are
plugged into that switch I also plugged
in a light string over here so we can
know whether it's on or off and then
when we're done watching TV we switch
that off cuts the power to everything so
anything that might have a trickle draw
that might be wasting power just in
standby mode is cut off by using that
switch and I think I might apply that
elsewhere in the house because when you
actually have an app that you look at
that you can see your power draw usage
at any given time makes you think like
wow switching that on suddenly like
jumped up the power usage by a thousand
watts or switching that stuff off helped
reduce the nominal power usage so so
little things like that I think will
help keep the power draw from the grids
to a minimum hopefully never more than
one or two percent break in 4900 watts
it's pretty awesome I think my biggest
incentive to clean the panel's is to try
to break 5k we're breaking 4900 but it'd
be nice to see it get about 5k there's
one final look at the system though it's
a little bit dusty now that it has been
broken in but um so here's here's the
final mystery that I'm trying to solve
and my theory as to how it's working and
this is based on a few other videos on
Tesla and the pyro wall and solar that I
found online in my research so here's
the main panel 200 amp breaker and then
I got to 100 amp breakers ones for the
AC once for the Gateway after the
Gateway over here everything should be
backed up by the battery and it has does
have a switch for the battery so the AC
is not on this panel and yet when a C
has been running it apparently according
to the charts has been drawing power
from the power wall so I'm not 100% sure
how that's working I don't know if the
AC is being fed back through the Gateway
somehow or if there's some sort of load
balancing it's doing where it's actually
feeding back from the power wall to the
grid well it's also pulling energy to
run the AC off the grid I've read some
speculation on that but I'll see if I
can get more details on that before the
next video that's all the time I have
for this one though guys thank you so
much for watching I'm going a little
blind because it's sunny which is good
the Sun is good because it provides me
power now but I'm gonna get inside or
maybe at least put
Hannah I hit the thumbs-up button if you
enjoyed this video though and of course
leave me comments in the comment section
down below if you have any questions for
the final follow-up video which is going
to be in about a month or so thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
