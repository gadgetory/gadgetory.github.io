they do what is up everybody welcome
back to the channel and the third
installment in my first five video
series the series that's insanely
popular with people with short attention
spans who don't like any task where
there are more than five steps involved
in today's video I'm going to be talking
about the first five things that come to
my mind when I'm setting up to do some
benchmarking because that's what I've
been doing recently with the msi r9 390x
gaming 8g I'm working on that in a
future video so don't forget to
subscribe if you wanna stay tuned for
that one I also have some fury X's in
the pipeline maybe some more work with
the 980ti s but I wanted to start this
video off by saying a huge thank you to
those of you who gave me feedback and
likes and even the dislikes on the last
couple first five videos on a
motherboard - the one on Windows
installation it is because of your
feedback that I've decided to bring this
series back and even several of you
actually asked for the one on GPUs and
benchmarking so that's where this one
came from now I'm talking about GPUs
here when it comes to setting up for
benchmarks but this could really apply
to CPUs or SSDs or any other component
in your system that you might want to
benchmark as I was getting my list
together for this video I realized that
these are more about preparing to
benchmark but that's really
Gordon setting up and preparing because
benchmarking can be very time-consuming
so when you're preparing you can help
eliminate any pitfalls that might cause
you to have to redo work later on and
that can save you a lot of time in the
long run but on with the show thing
number one is to start with a plan and
since my focus was mainly on the r9 390x
gaming AG here from MSI this kind of
fell into place with how I arranged the
rest of them Tamiya benchmarking setup
now I actually haven't even plugged this
video card in and started to benchmark
it yet you might notice that I have a
980 on the test bed right now and then I
also have a 970 here that's because when
I realized as much marking the 390x
I wanted to plan to give some
comparative benchmarks that were against
other video cards in the price range and
the United seventy is a little bit
cheaper 980 s a little bit more
expensive the 390x falls right in the
middle so obviously this is a GPU I'm
gonna be benchmarking some video games
with it but even beyond that there's a
bunch of other variables that can be
involved what resolution are you gonna
focus on for example am I going to be
doing 1080 1440 or 4k or some other
resolution as well
am i benchmarking one game or am i vet
benchmarking multiple games setting that
stuff up at the beginning can really
help you focus your efforts in order to
save time in the long run so to get your
plan down from stage one you should know
what hardware you're gonna be
benchmarking what software you're going
to use to benchmark that hardware and
what your test bed configuration is
going to be now I have a set test bed
right here if you don't have that you
can use your computer at home but
keeping that test bed consistent
throughout the testing is very important
and I'll come back to that in just a
moment thing number two is to update
everything before you start benchmarking
I cannot stress the importance of this
for instance last night I went ahead and
refreshed my windows 8.1 installation on
this test bed I actually went for a from
scratch installation and added all the
windows updates and everything if you do
this frequently it's definitely gonna be
worth your while to get Windows
installation done all the drivers
installed and then make an image using
imaging software using the built-in
stuff within windows to create something
separately you can load back onto that
the key element for getting consistent
benchmarks over time with your test bit
is to have it as clean as possible you
don't want other stuff gunking it up so
every so often at least every month or
so you're probably going to want to
refresh that operating system installed
to make sure that there's not too much
other stuff going on
so after Windows is installed and run
all your
dates to make sure Windows Update is
updated because you don't want that
kicking off and trying to run it while
you're running your benchmarks and then
you want to go ahead and get all your
drivers updated so chip said of course
key among the drivers you'll be
installing is going to be your graphics
card drivers so make sure you get the
latest version from Nvidia or from AMD's
website and also keep an eye out for if
a driver has launched recently if it's
been awhile say a month or two or if
there's an upcoming triple-a game launch
for example you might want to hold off
and see if they're about to drop a new
driver nothing's more frustrated than
running through a bunch of benchmarks
with the existing graphics card driver
and then a day or two later then
watching a new GPU driver and you being
like well now my benchmarks are not
irrelevant but they're a lot less
relevant in that situation beyond the
driver updates you want to also make
sure your software is updated properly
so that means all of the games whether
you have Steam installs or otherwise
just run each one first make sure it's
patched and up-to-date and that those
are all good to go the last thing I look
at is my monitoring applications that I
use some popular lightweight ones are
going to be CPU Z as well as HW monitor
or Hardware monitor you can also get GPU
Z and I've run all three of those
there's other ones out there so those
are not the end all and be all I 264 is
another one that I like to throw out
there that's a little bit more heavy I'd
say than some of the basic monitoring
programs so just make sure you have
those set up you're gonna want to
monitor stuff while you're running the
benchmarks and you want those to be
up-to-date as well thing number three is
be consistent how does one maintain
consistency while benchmarking well done
great way to do this is to start out
with a plan like I mentioned in thing
number one so doing that you're already
kind of off to the right step but
there's some other things to keep in
mind because you want to eliminate the
possible variables as you're switching
from one graphics card to another or
you're switching between say a standard
setting as far as GPU frequency and an
overclocked setting you want to make
sure that the only variable between
those two things is a graphics card that
you're changing for example so for that
reason you don't want to go ahead and be
doing any crazy overclocking or changing
your overclock settings in between
benchmarks if you are overclocking your
testbed make sure that overclock is
engaged and make sure you've done some
stability testing on that because that's
another thing you don't want to do is
run some benchmarks and then suddenly
get a blue screen or something and you
realize you've overclock your cpu too
much
and then that might affect all your old
benchmarks that they might be go over
and redo things that's really what it's
all about avoiding another way to
maintain consistency is to run each
benchmark at least three times that's
kind of the bare minimum standard and if
there's much variance between those
three runs then run them even more than
that oftentimes people will run five
times and then they'll throw out the
highest and lowest numbers but three
times is generally a good standard to go
with you can also do reality checking as
you're running your benchmarks so find
someone else online who has run a
similar benchmark configuration to you
see what tests they have run and then
see if you're getting numbers that are
within the same general ballpark now
granted as already mentioned lots of
little variables can affect benchmark
numbers but generally speaking if I'm
running say for instance a 59 60 X like
I would be here versus a 59 30 K back
there that's not gonna affect it too
hugely but it's a good idea to go online
and make sure that the numbers you
getting aren't too far below what the
expected amount would be because that
might mean that something's wrong if you
do encounter a situation where you don't
feel like you're getting the right
numbers that's where you might go over
and lean on your your benchmarking
monitoring apps you can see if the
temperatures may be too high
reality checking is very important as
you go along and don't just run
benchmarks and run benchmarks until you
come back to them later on and be like
oh these numbers really aren't what they
should be thing number four is a little
bit out there so bear with me here I
want you to go vertical or horizontal
sounds sounds exciting right but no what
actually mean here is that you should
focus focus what you're going to be
benchmarking so that you don't spend too
much time again time is just it's a time
suck it will suck the time out of your
life and it will give you nothing in
return except benchmark results I
suppose but what do I mean by going
vertical or going horizontal well the
idea here is that if you're gonna be
benchmarking say a 390 X and you want to
benchmark it against a bunch of other
GPUs like a 980 and a 970 and a 290x and
whatever other graphics card you're
testing it against and then you want to
also do each of those graphics cards
with like seven eight or nine different
games which is great and people do that
so if you want to save a little bit of
your time then going horizontal I'm
gonna say means testing a bunch of
different graphics cards with one game
so you might say here's my GTA 5 testing
with a bunch of graphics cards and then
people
or interested in gta5 tests can go look
at that going vertical at least in this
explanation means you're testing maybe
one GPU or maybe just a few two or three
at most but you're testing that against
a bunch of multiple games going for lots
of games and lots of GPUs it's just a
recipe for sucking away two or three
weeks of your life which if you've got
the time and go for it a lot of people
do that and and I like reading those
articles but for me it's that's too much
time and finally thing number five is to
give comparisons I see lots of
benchmarks posted online and all they
have is one set of benchmarks for the
single card that they might be
benchmarking for example not that that's
like completely useless but without a
frame of reference it's hard to say that
that's good oh that's bad you could look
elsewhere online you can do reality
checking for example you can look at
other benchmark sites at a benchmark but
really you're the only person who can
say for absolutely sure that you have
neutralized all of the other variables
so that you're giving a direct eight to
be comparison especially if you've been
following any of the advice through this
video so for that exam for that reason I
will say always give at least one set of
comparison benchmark numbers now if
you're in a situation where like you're
like all I've only got one graphics card
I don't have a set of them like you do
that's cool and I understand so maybe do
something like run your graphics card at
the stock feed that it comes out of the
box and then overclock it and run the
benchmarks with overclock numbers and
you have like point A to point B
comparison numbers and that gives you at
least something else to go with
providing a baseline set of results so
you can look at those numbers and say ah
number B is higher than number a and
therefore number B is superior
makes the benchmark just a lot more
satisfying to look at now the one last
thing I'll point out here is that since
you're running these mention marks on us
since I'm saying give a basis for
comparison
you should also set up some sort of
logging mechanism I like to use Google
Docs just open up a spreadsheet there
you can make it as complex or as simple
as you want but it's a great way to keep
things logged and then you can just go
ahead and get a laptop or something
punched in those numbers as you run all
of your benchmarks and that is all those
are my first five things for
benchmarking a GPU specifically but of
course applies to other things as well I
know there's other things out there too
that might come to your mind when you're
thinking
what are the first things that I think
about when I'm about to do some
benchmarking so post those in the
comment section down below I'm sure
there's gonna be some people out there
who are like we didn't mention anything
about like setting up to a measure power
draw for example I like getting a
kilowatt or some other power measuring
device to do that you might be a little
bit more concerned about temperatures
may be setting up instead of on a test
bed inside of the case doing something
like that for more accurate results
another extremely popular thing is just
to unplug from the internet entirely
while you run your benchmarks which I do
sometimes but not always but again let
me know in the comment section what you
guys do or think about when you're
setting up to run benchmarks on a
graphics card thank you so much for
