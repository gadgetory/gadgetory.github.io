welcome back to Pauls Harbor today I'm
going to be doing a little video on this
video card right here this is the galaxy
gtx 680 GC which is their term for the
overclocked edition and i'm just going
to be giving you guys a closer look at
the car itself because it does have a
customized white PCB as well as a pretty
cool aftermarket cooler and then i'm
going to be sharing some benchmarks
because i did get a chance to test this
in one single card configuration as well
as 2-way sli so here's a closer look at
the card as you can see beautiful custom
white PCB you don't see white PCBs on
many computer parts in general these
days as you can see it's a very nice
clear white color it's got a customized
triple fan cooler on it as you can also
see with a massive heat piped aluminum
fin array keeping everything running
nice and cool I can confirm that this
works very effectively as it kept the
card well within temperature ranges
during my benchmarking sessions even
while it was in two-way SLI but here's
some detailed specs on the card the GPU
inside is an nvidia geforce gtx 680
that's the gk104 codename GPU based on
their 28 nanometer technology codename
kepler it's got a pci express 3.0
interface it also has 1536 cuda cores
it's directx 11.1 compatible also
includes two gigabytes or 2048 megabytes
of gddr5 ram on a 256-bit bus giving you
a total memory bandwidth of 192 point
three gigabytes per second now this is
an overclocked card the basic GPU clock
is at eleven eleven megahertz 1111 it
has a boost clock that will generally
speaking get it up to 1176 megahertz
assuming of course with the cards is
operating within temperature parameters
set by nvidia however i can confirm that
this particular card here was running
along at eleven 88.9 megahertz or just
about 1189 megahertz during just about
all of my tests also the memories
collect at 1502 megahertz
or 6,000 for megahertz effective as far
as temperature goes we never got up
higher than the low to mid 70s and most
of the time is running in the mid to
upper 60s that's in celsius by the way
60 to 70 degrees Celsius here's also
look at the video that's on the card and
here's one point where I was slightly
disappointed with the design decision
that's galaxy went with as you can see
we have three mini HDMI outs which is
just fine but the adapters that they've
included is a mini HDMI to standard HDMI
just one of those and then a standard
hdmi to DVI so if you have a DVI monitor
or if you have a couple DVI monitors I
should say you will be needed to buy an
additional adapter for this card you
also get a full-size DisplayPort and I
generally prefer to splay port to hdmi
where it is available so nice to have
that one on there as well but then
finally for power requirements we have
two 8-pin pci express power connectors
that's as compared to the reference gtx
680 which uses two 6-pin PCI Express
power connectors and that is again
because this card is factory overclocked
and also has that custom design with the
custom power delivery maiden by galaxy
next up we're going to take a look at
some benchmarks and as previously
mentioned I got a chance to benchmark
discarding one card configuration as
well as two-way SLI so i'll be showing
you guys both of those hope you enjoy
here the benchmarks
that's going to wrap it up for this
video guys once again this has been the
galaxy gtx 680 GC custom white edition
thanks a lot for watching subscribe if
you'd like to see more videos and we'll
see you next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
