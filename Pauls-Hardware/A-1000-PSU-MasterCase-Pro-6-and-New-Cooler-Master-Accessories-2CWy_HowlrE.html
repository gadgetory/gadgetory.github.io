coverage here from Las Vegas Nevada
first off we want to thank my sponsors
for this event gigabyte D cool as well
as OCC a Toshiba Company
we're here at coolermaster right now
though and they have a ton of stuff on
display but we're very limited on time
so we asked them to show us their most
wonderful things they started off by
showing us the new mastercase pro 6
which we're expecting to be launched
soon
q3 about q3 timeframe so maybe after
kaki Tex this is of course continuing
all of the functionality and
interoperability and interchangeability
and make it yours enos of the mastercase
series so all of the products that are
up on the wall right here as far as
interchanging things will work as far as
like their modular drive system and all
that kind of stuff this one's a little
bit more optimized for silence it has a
tempered glass side panel on the right
now it's going to ship with that and
then also this top piece here actually
has a couple positions so you can drop
it down it'll close things in block some
of that noise out of course you lose a
little bit of airflow but then it can
easily pop that back up too if you want
to let the air out so maybe if you're
gaming pop it up if you're you know
doing other work that's not going to be
a stressful leave it in the down
position speaking of the modular stuff
though they have on display here one of
the new modular items that they have
they're going to be selling on them on
the Coolermaster store they're all
available again they're all up on the
wall here but the vertical vertical
graphics cards holder and cable will
allow you to get a little PCI Express
extender flip your graphics card up 90
90 degrees so you can get a much better
view of it and a very nice clean system
here with some MSI Hardware in there and
a create motherboard looking very very
nice I also like the LEDs they've
integrated here those are coolermaster
LEDs very nice even tone across all of
them and a nice clear white anyway
though the other products that are up on
the wall here that are all pretty cool I
mean you've seen some of these they have
added additional SSD holders so you can
have them vertical or horizontal or even
the extended version here that sticks
them out vertically and of course those
will all fit in with the modular frames
free form system I really like these
mastercase pro 3 LED partition panels
I've never really seen anything quite
like this but they have a system setup
with that over here
it's just a blue panel that sits kind of
on the bottom right on your power supply
shroud and it gives illumination across
the entire bottom they have a blue one
over there they also have a red and a
white one who knows could these ever be
RGB in the future they might be our GB
in the future possibly no promises now
but that would be cool too I mean if
you're into RGB of course but actually
the thing that they seemed most excited
about and I feel like since I just
listened to Kyle say all of these things
I'm repeating everything that he said so
I'm going to steal all of all of his
stuff he's also the camera person right
now and talk about this right here this
is a $1,000 power supply and you're like
why is it $1,000 because it's the best
power supply ever made that's what
Coolermaster says but I tend to believe
them this is the master watt maker 1,200
mi j mi J stands for made in Japan and
Coolermaster said conceptually what if
we built the power supply and we did not
care about cost or anything like that we
just wanted to make the best power
supply possible so for that dad to go
out and work with some new partners the
specific partner they worked with his
Mirada they're described to us as kind
of NASA of Japan and you can look up
more information on that if you're
interested but they worked with them to
basically add additional filtration and
other components in there that I'm not
even qualified to talk about really but
basically to like make it the cleanest
power you could possibly get like zero
ripple and all incredibly high-quality
components all from Japan the design
work and the actual build quality of
this thing is really insane they have a
clear model of it here so you can look
inside and see just a soldering it's
like on point so $1000 of course pretty
expensive for a 1200 watt power supply
but for specific use cases if you really
really need clean power or if you just
gotta have the best of the best that's
kind of who this is aimed at Kenzo
tomorrow as the name of the project
engineer his pictures down here and he's
like the lead engineer who helped design
this with Coolermaster yeah I can't even
say anything more about this because
again I'm not fully qualified but comes
in a very nice package down there it's
fully modular of course any features you
might have expected a power supply to
have ever they got the really
the connection points that are different
than the typical modular cables that you
get and just a very nice package and
just I guess the best power supply ever
that coolermaster has made it rates it's
rated above titanium so they need to
make a new a new thing beyond titanium
and cows videos suggested double black
diamond I was thinking maybe maybe they
need to go into a different different
materials or it completely how about
like food I want to call it eighty plus
ATP no potato would be bad it starts at
potato and then that works at web works
its way up to like a velvet cake I think
this is a t+ velvet cake created that
makes no sense I don't know I pulled
that on my ass alright that's all I have
to say about this and finally out here
we talked about the modular system
that's inside for the matcha Casemaker
series this is their work to give you a
little bit more customization outside so
these are actually spray painted panels
that they might potentially be selling
on the store so you can buy different
pieces pop them in give your case you
know a nice gray finish a yellow perhaps
a more patriotic theme moving down the
line here we have some wraps that are
going on here so a bit of a carbon-fiber
accents also even different finishes on
the handles that you can put on top to
carry the case around and then finally
over here we have this which is a vacuum
wrap and actually gives you like a wood
finish on the end so a ton of options
there they've been working on stickers
so I think what we would like is some
comments in the comment section that
maybe coolermaster could read and give
some feedback from you guys about which
of the stuff up here you think looks
coolest and that they should stock in
their store that's all for my coverage
here from CES 2017 of the cooler master
suite big thanks again to my sponsors
gigabyte OCD a till she become Panisse
well as deep cool thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
