welcome to today's video which is going
to be pretty sloppy this is a garage
work log and I have some goals that I'm
going to try to accomplish today
the goals do not include doing good
filming though so that's why I have the
camera sets like full automatic right
now and apart from that I wanted to
share my situation so let me show you
guys what's going on here so this is
where I've been kind of like getting
work done I don't know for the past few
weeks or month or two or whatever and as
you can see it's pretty much like just
all in chaos and shambles there's just
stuff everywhere this is our dining room
table which we haven't used to eat
dinner and quite some time that's an
extra table I set up over there I keep
moving stuff back and forth from between
the garage and out here and we're trying
to go through like an organization
project but um it's just kind of become
a sprawling mess but apart from all that
let me kind of walk in here to show you
guys the situation in the garage look
how dark it is so the garage is also a
sprawling mess and this is like my desk
where I like do stuff over here this is
like my workbench which is covered with
crap there's all this stuff over here
and every I don't know I don't know
where any of this stuff came from but
the main point is that I'm going to be
doing some air conditioning out here
which I've been talking about for quite
some time I'm finally ready to do I was
going to go for a split unit but I've
decided to take a hopefully an easier
route and go with a portable unit
because it was much cheaper and
installation wise I think I'm just gonna
have any hopefully an easier time with
it so here's what I'm going to try to do
today if I can one is to set up some
exhaust for the AC and second is to
insulate the garage door over here which
will hopefully handle insulation as well
as a bit of noise dampening so I have a
kit I'll show you guys that in hopefully
just a few minutes for now I need to
race against the clock to get this AC up
and running because it's supposed to be
like well over 100 degrees today in
Southern California and if I don't get
this thing up and running I'm just I'm
not going to be able to spend any time
out here in the garage so my main
dilemma is that I have a 5-inch exhaust
hose for this a/c unit that goes on the
back of it and yes you have to kick the
the hot air out some somewhere I'm
planning on going through my same place
where the dryer goes in
that's but this is a four inch so I've
gotten a replacement one of these guys
to vent it outside that's going to kick
through the wall right there and then
I've gone and gotten this little
splitter right here so this is a four
inch and a five inch both going into a
five inch so that's going to come out of
the wall they're going to be able to do
the dryer through one AC through the
other and then I also got these baffles
which are like one-way one-way units and
that will help me keep like for instance
when I have AC on and it'll keep it from
ejecting back up into the dryer if the
bear is kicking out stuff it'll keep it
from coming back up into the AC and I
hope this all works anyway
let's let's get this done
okay so in the interest of moving on
with stage two for today and keep them
things little below here see I got the
five inch hole punch through and moved
in here from the outside and I have just
run the temporary exhaust from the AC to
that and I have actually used duct tape
on a duct this is like the first this is
an absolute first for me that's there's
duct tape on a duct as you can see if
the dryer exhaust is not currently
connected and I need to do some cleanup
still but this is just to get this AC
unit tested so one thing is I honestly
haven't even powered it on or anything
like that this is a 12,000 BTU unit from
higher it's supposed to be pretty quiet
and it says it will handle about a 500
square foot room and this garage is
about 300 square feet so even though
it's got like taller ceilings and
everything it is insulated so I think we
should be okay in here okay I think
that's all that's this work on on no
broken okay I'm back from Home Depot and
now it's on to the next phase which is
these big old boxes right here that were
shipped to me this is my garage door
installation project so I'm gonna get
started on that but stuff I got at Home
Depot I got like some insulation for the
tubing which i think is a be useful with
these metal strips I'm going to use to
hopefully mount it to the wall I got I
get this guy right here which is just
kind of a fun fun little thing I haven't
had before
there no infrared thermometer you can
tell how hot stuff is apparently it's 83
degrees okay so yeah I'm going to put
the insulation around the tubing and
then I got some caulk and a bunch of
other stuff so you grab this I'm not
sure why I'm doing all this while I'm
filming I should have done this well
that wasn't filming but here goes
alright so that in the garage there's my
lovely weather stripping for around the
garage door that's what I'm gonna work
on next here's my new and improved
tubing duct
so I'm working on getting this all set
up I got got a couple 90-degree elbow
bends there so I can kind of bring it
from where it's coming out of the wall
over there around at an angle because
I'd like to have this up against the
wall rather than just sticking out into
the garage applying the baffles to it to
again keep air from back drafting but
I'm actually going to put this little
project on hold for now because I do
have the a/c functional although I just
turned it off so yeah AC is functional
up and running and exhausting out the
side of the garage and I'm going to
leave that as is for the time being
because yeah I wish it was a little bit
quieter that's for sure I thought this
is going to be a little bit quieter than
it is but I think it's still alright
because now I have this that I need to
work on like ASAP this is the Sun has
sun's moving around and then the Sun
will start hitting the garage door later
in a day and it's probably already like
hotter than it should be how does it you
get to see that focus focus
yeah it's already the garage door is
already over 100
okay guys I'm not exactly sure when I
cut off the last video but I wanted to
do an update here so yeah all the work
has been done on the garage door over
here and also the air conditioner unit
down there and I'm going to show you
guys what I did and how it's working out
I'm also watching the set for a nation
livestream right now because sapphire
edie as well as Doug are like doing
shots for followers and stuff and
they're both they're both a little
toasty right now they're having a good
time uh so I'm just chilling out here
guys if you haven't if you've never
checked out a set the Sapphire
livestream sapphire nation they're good
people there so check it out and this
one in particular has been quite funny
but anyway so let's take a look first
off the AC unit over here and this has
been doing a pretty good job I've
actually run this through some tests now
that I have everything sealed up it's
louder than I wanted it to be so that's
a little bit of an issue but what it's
doing is it's making it liveable in here
in the afternoons when it's getting
pretty warm and like the 90s and low
hundreds here in the back you can see
where I've gone and I did some
insulation around this entire tube I use
a little splitter tube which you can
maybe see down there at the bottom so
that actually the dryer tube comes down
there and it goes up in here I put the
two baffles in between there's a baffle
there and there's a baffle up here other
than that I just did a little metal
bracket on the wall to kind of hold that
whole assembly in place again I
insulated everything on the inside
because there's a lot of hot this whole
tube gets really warm and it just
emanates heat so insulating it's going
to help keep more of that heat going
outside and then there's where that
punches through the hole goes to the
outside and actually even did a somewhat
reasonable job and put sealants around
edges all that and stuff so that's been
doing a pretty good job I'm actually
really happy with that so what this is
allowing me to do is come out here in
the mornings so if I get out here in the
morning I can actually sit over here in
my space and get some work done
if I need to sit there like behind the
camera or be on camera because like
let's be honest the main issue with it
being hot is that I get sweaty and stuff
but I can I can record the on-camera
stuff in the morning and then this the
a/c keeps its cool enough in the
afternoon that I can be out here
shooting like some b-roll or any of that
kind
stuffin and get all that stuff done all
right now obviously there's a whole lot
of work still left to be done out here
but I can actually do it it's like a
look at what I did with the garage door
and then lastly I have some overhead
ceiling racks to put up that I just
picked up yesterday
and that's what I'm going to be working
on for this the day today so here's the
garage door from the inside and
basically what that kit was as a bunch
of styrofoam panels that you kind of cut
down to the right size and then they
just kind of pop in here in they stay in
place they don't really need much to
hold them because they're pretty
lightweight that provides some
insulation I was using the heat gun on
this and in the afternoon because the
Sun comes in the afternoon it actually
hits this door directly then the
afternoon this was making the difference
in temperature of about 10 to 20 degrees
depending on where I was pointing a
little laser again it actually even
provides a little bit of sound dampening
it's not killing the noise of the trains
going by or anything like that but I'm
actually pretty happy with how this has
turned out so far and I'm still debating
whether I'm going to do these top
windows and kind of fill in around the
edges I still like the windows I like
having a little bit of light coming in
from that but I'm that's still that
still remains to be seen how that's all
going to work out here's the exhaust and
I did seal around the outside of this as
well just for some some weather sealing
there then skull flap down here that's
uh opens up which is some air pressure
so that the air can come out and it's
all coming out there nice and strong so
those baffles aren't killing the airflow
very much on the front of the garage I
did this ceiling sort of around the
outside edge so these are just picked up
a Home Depot they're really not very
expensive at all and they have these
little little flaps that go there and
just push up against the inside of the
edge of the door and it's closed works
out pretty well actually so I did those
all around the outside I went and sealed
around the edges of that also with
sealant I suppose or the plastic II
stuff again just trying to kill anywhere
that air might seep through of course
you're still going to get air in the
gaps of the garage door and stuff but
this is like way way way better already
I can tell than it was even down here to
the bottom I sealed around there and
then this side of the garage door was
actually that the cement was a little
bit lower so I put a little bit of foam
stripping just along the edge right
there to kind of keep a seal along that
edge and then also replaced
at least part of this this rubber pad
here that kind of compresses when they
when the door goes down and that makes
sure that the air stays inside and
lastly I have a couple overhead metal
white roof racks there's four overhead
storage I'm going to set up here in the
garage this is the last thing and I'm
going to close off this video with this
little time lapse so hope you guys have
enjoyed watching me toil away in my
garage making some upgrades here of
course I have lots of work still to do
so I have a few more garage work logs
probably coming your way I have some
tech videos too I'm going to throw in
there too so stay tuned subscribe to my
