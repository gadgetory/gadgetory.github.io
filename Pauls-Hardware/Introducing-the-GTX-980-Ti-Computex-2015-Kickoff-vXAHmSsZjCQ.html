my copy text 2015 coverage I am here in
Taipei Taiwan okay I'm not actually in
Taipei Taiwan i'm still in Los Angeles
I've actually been invited to a special
press event by Nvidia so I'm gonna head
inside if you're watching this video it
means it's June first and i am now
allowed to present this information i
have no idea what they're going to be
showing off inside so i'm going to head
in but first before i do that big thank
you to my sponsors for computex 2015 i
would not be here without them or in
taiwan which is where I'll be when you
watch this video that is anyway msi
coolermaster as well as g.skill big
thanks to them and on with the show
after successfully passing through
several security checkpoints and
submitting myself to a full body cavity
search I was led to a small dank room
where I met the mysterious and elusive
Brian as well as Tom from Nvidia they
laid some knowledge on me which I will
now share with you guys because I now
know what the knowledge is and I can do
that now of course the biggest news is a
geforce gtx 980 TI it has been confirmed
and it is going to be selling for six
hundred and fifty dollars MSRP along
with the 980 TI launch comes a gtx 980
price drop that's going all the way down
to five hundred dollars so you guys if
you're interested in 9980 can get that
for a few less dollars but a lot of the
information they talked about was
somewhat related to the 980 TI we're
going to talk a little bit about g-sync
a little bit about Direct X 12 a little
bit about virtual reality and then I'll
be coming back to the 980 TI at the end
because I have specs that I can share
with you guys let's start out by talking
a little bit about g-sync first off LCD
monitors have something called overdrive
that they do with their pixels they try
to push a pixel towards a specific color
more aggressively than they actually
need to in order to get to that color by
the time the monitor is going to refresh
nvidia is working on something called
variable overdrive this will predict the
next pixel refresh so that it can be
refreshed in a quicker manner in order
to work within the limitations of the
variable refresh rate that g-sync
actually does it doesn't make sense
basically what they're trying to do is
make things faster for you and also make
sure that as the LCD is refreshing it
can actually get you the proper colors
now a variable drive will predict the
next pixel refresh time it will apply
the overdrive
accordingly it basically solves that
problem which is one of the limitations
of variable refresh rate monitors
another thing that they mentioned was
that g-sync actually does not have a
performance impact so bear that in mind
that's been a common misconception
people think that when you turn on vsync
you get less performance that's actually
not true another cool thing that they
have what you think is windowed mode
g-sync which is something that folks
have been asking for at least according
to nvidia i didn't quite see the the
practical purpose for it but when i
asked them they said well it's something
that people ask for so we did that after
using multiple games whatever window has
focus will refresh the monitor
accordingly so g-sync will work with
whatever game you're running so if you
like to run multiple games in windowed
mode this this updates for you I suppose
another cool thing is that g-sync is now
going to be coming to more notebooks the
900 m series notebooks will support
g-sync and NVIDIA actually wants to make
g-sync a standard on all of their gaming
notebooks which I think makes a lot of
sense another nice thing about g-sync is
that no scalar is needed since the
scaling takes place within the g-sync
module chip that's another benefit and
NVIDIA is going to be releasing or they
are now working on the first 75 first
gaming notebook displays let's move on
though let's talk a little bit about
DirectX 12 since the 980 TI is fully
compatible with directx 12 there's
actually a few different levels of
DirectX 12 there's 12 0 which has a cool
features like volume titled resources
sounds very complicated but basically
you have a what would traditionally be
rendered a full texture you have a tiled
texture which is breaking that texture
up so it doesn't have to render the
entire texture and then volume titled
textures is a new thing which adds three
dimensions to it so you can break up a
texture and you can only render the
textures that are needed to render and
that's going to save you some GPU
compute time there's also a feature with
DirectX 12 underscore zero or I'm sorry
Direct X 12 underscore one called
conservative raster anytime that it's
doing 3d operations of the lonely 3d
pipeline as its rendering your game at a
certain point it needs to rasterize the
image which is basically to take 3d
polygons and make it into actual pixels
conservative raster will basically it
renders outside of the lines
the inside of the lines as you can bite
maybe see in this image and this was
going to lead to much better shadow
reproduction so especially when you're
using ray tracing and ray traced shadows
you'll notice much cleaner shadows and
that's just one of the cool features of
DirectX well it can give you better
image quality without necessarily
hurting your performance moving out to
some VR news NVIDIA has been working a
lot on VR and if you guys are interested
in VR well you should keep watching this
video I suppose all right so let's talk
about their VAR optics system which is
using something called multi res shading
now the traditional or older method of
rendering when you're using VR because
you need a different image for each eye
and you also need to warp the edges of
the image in order for it to look
properly since the image is actually so
close to your eye now the old method
would render the standard image and it
would warp the edges of the image in
order to make it appear properly when
you're actually looking at it through VR
goggles now what the new method is
called is multi res sheeting and what
they're actually doing is they're
splitting the screen up into a bunch of
different viewports that's what nvidia
calls them and then with the center
viewport there's no warping needed but
around the edges they will actually work
those individually this is going to
solve the problem that the older method
method had which was that it was
rendering pixels that you didn't
actually see on the screen it does it in
real time so it does it multi so multi
res shading actually renders this whole
thing in one single pass it doesn't need
to go through it multiple times the end
result is about 1.3 x 22 x the pixel
shader performance so if you're a VR fan
that's going to be something that you're
definitely gonna be interested in their
VR stuff that Nvidia is working on by
the way is part of their game works sdk
for VR game developers and I'm sure
that's something that a lot of folks are
going to be looking forward to as we
move towards a proliferation of VR
devices that are actually coming out to
the market now thank God but I know the
biggest news that you guys are probably
most interested in is confirmation of
the price point which already told you
for the GTX 980 TI that's six hundred
and fifty dollars as well as these
specifications let me run down those for
you right now you'll find that it is
extremely extremely similar to the
g-force
and the to the titan x which nvidia
already launched except it has six gigs
of video memory instead of 12 gigs of
video memory other specs include six
graphics processing clusters 22
streaming multiprocessors a total of two
thousand eight hundred and sixteen at
cuda cores 176 texture unit units 96 are
Opie's it's going to run out of base
clock of a thousand megahertz and it
will get a boost clock of about a
thousand 75 in my experience usually the
GPUs scale beyond that and go even
faster and of course this is going to be
overclockable as well the memory clock
is 3500 5 megahertz or about seven
thousand ten affective memory data rate
is seven gigabits per second and it's
got a 384-bit memory interface already
mentioned six gigs are 6144 megabytes of
gddr5 memory memory bandwidth the 336
point 5 gigabytes per second it's still
built on the 28 nanometer manufacturing
process no surprise there eight billion
transistors since this is the big
Maxwell vs. a smaller Maxwell that we
saw with the GTX 980 3 display part outs
on hdmi on a dual link DVI same form
factor dual slot and the same basic
design that we've seen in video use
since going all the way back to the
original GTX Titan but the recommended
power supplied for this is 600 watts
it's got a 250 watt TDP so again
sticking with the same TDP as the Titan
X and thermal threshold 92 degrees
Celsius and that is all the
specifications that I have about the
geforce gtx 980 TI now there's other
folks who have had this card for the
past's a week plus and they've been
testing it I haven't been able to do
that because I've been in China but I'm
I believe I'm going to be getting one as
soon as I get back and i'll be doing
some additional testing so if you're
watching this video let me know in the
comments what kind of tests what kind of
a demonstrations maybe you want to see
what the geforce gtx 980 TI and i will
see if i can do that in the meantime
though thank you for watching this video
this is my first copy text 2015 video
another big thank you to all my sponsors
msi coolermaster as well as g.skill and
by the way i'm in taiwan now i know at
the beginning of this video I was in Los
Angeles that's crazy how fast i went
from there to here if you don't believe
me it probably it probably doesn't look
all that special right now it's cuz i'm
in my hotel room ok here I'll show I'll
show you
yeah see that's that's that one out
there it's getting dark it's actually
sunday right now but i think i'm going
to go meet up with the guys from tech
syndicate so guys if you're watching
this video hit the like button and stay
tuned for more coverage from computex
2015 all out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
