to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake Coolermaster is
one of my sponsors for Computex 2018 so
a huge thank you to them
they were also right next to zou tech
and so attack was being very loud so I
decided to come back and do a little
voice over here at my hotel room so I'm
gonna try to keep my voice somewhat down
but I do have a ton of stuff that was at
the coolermaster booth to talk about so
let's start from the top
with all in one liquid coolers there's a
brand new mastered liquid RS series of
on ones that they're working on these
have a new dual chamber pump design as
well as a brushed aluminum housing for
the pump and block combo there so it's a
bit more distinct than the previous
versions and I thought it had a nice
solid feel to it
it also features addressable RGB LEDs on
the pump radiator and the fans as well
sleeved fep tubing so those were looking
pretty nice and definitely a step up
from the previous version now they also
had a couple concept all-in-one coolers
one was a simple heat transparent liquid
cooler so they gave you a look through
the actual pump you can see down into
the impeller some of the functional area
in there still has a cooler master logo
on it it didn't have one running there
so I cants couldn't see it spinning
around but thought I'd give you guys a
look just to see what you think and next
they had the thermal electric all in one
and this one actually is pretty cool
because it uses a thermoelectric unit
that's embedded in a radiator in order
to cool your CPU or I guess whatever
else you have this connected to down to
below ambient and they had a temperature
gauge connected to it that was running
at about 21 degrees Celsius which is
pretty impressive considering that the
ambient temperature there at the
convention center was more like 28 or 29
degrees Celsius we could actually keep
things even cooler than that by
providing more power to the
thermoelectric unit but they did say
that if they got things to cool like say
down below 17 or 18 degrees Celsius they
would start to have a little bit of
condensation so now you would want to be
prepared for that this unit also has an
aluminum block housing that looked a
pretty distinct it was more of a silver
finish as well as that dual radiator one
of them the larger one with some copper
heat pipes embedded has the
thermoelectric unit that's housed within
it and then there's a smaller radiator
just to provide some additional cooling
next was a bit of a history lesson for
the hyper 212 which is one of the most
popular products I believe that
coolermaster has ever brought to market
going all the way back to the less-known
2007 version as well as the 2009 version
and then the hyper to 12x that they
launched in 2013 they're working on a
new version of this they want to bring
it back to market within some new flavor
so they've added an additional heat pipe
five heat pipes now instead of four
they put a plastic black cap on the top
to provide a little bit more of an
aesthetic blending with the modern
trends in PC hardware and then they've
also added of course RGB LEDs in the fan
as well as the logo up on top they've
also done some fanciness with the
aluminum fins and they've actually kind
of bent the edges of them in order to
provide more of a direct airflow across
the fins less of an open side so this is
a bit more of an industrial design and
it is again supposed to aid and cooling
of course we'll need to test this to be
absolutely sure but coolermaster is
looking for feedback on this as well as
a few other things in this video so let
them know if you like this current
design if you think it's a worthy
successor to the hyper 212 and maybe how
much you think it should cost the
original one was a great deal at around
30 to 35 dollars most of the time you
could give you get it even less than
that especially the older versions so
hopefully this will also be an awesome a
bang for the buck next let's switch over
to cases and here is the H 500 not the H
500 P not the H 500 M but a more
standard version of the H 500 it's going
to cost $99 MSRP they do still have the
two options for the front panel so you
can go with mesh if you want better air
flow or you can use a plastic cover
there that will let you see a better
look at those front fans and you do get
the same two 200 millimeter RGB fans
like you have an aged 500 P not the
addressable ones but this is I guess
slightly more of a budget option at
about $100 they've also improved the
mounting method for the tempered glass
side panel you can actually turn them
with your thumbs so they're like thumb
screws now and you don't need to get a
flat head or something like that to
actually turn them and remove it and now
quick aside here for a concept product
that I thought was interesting if not
that practical this is an H 500 M
concept build with a whole system tray
that is swappable so if you decide that
you want to swap your computer into a
different case and you happen to have a
case that's compatible with this tray
you can actually remove the entire tray
which includes a motherboard graphics
card and even has mounts for a pump and
an entire liquid cooling setup pull that
whole thing out provided I assume you
and plug the
tables and swap it into a different case
it was a cool executed concept because
it did obviously show that it worked and
you could just pull the whole unit out I
don't see quite the practicality of
swapping your system easily into a
different case because I just don't do
that too often but it was there so I
guess select Coolermaster know what you
think of that and if you think they
should go ahead with creating a product
based on that design one unique aspect
of this was the vertical GPU mount
though Coolermaster has called this the
chimney mount which I just assumed is
referencing the fact that most GPUs
would then exhaust air up and out of the
case kind of like a chimney but there
are a couple more cases coming up that
also have a chimney mount for the GPU
including this one the big one the
cosmos see 700 mm4 maker edition so this
I believe is going to be the highest end
cosmos see 700 the huge case it's still
got those iconic full-length aluminum
handles across the top so very distinct
it's also got a massive curved tempered
glass side panel that's on a hinge so
you can open it fairly easily as well as
some pretty cool RGB effects integrated
RGB tracks that go down the front of the
case and even though this is RGB which
means it requires a connection to the
case that front panel is still pretty
easily removable there's just a contact
point down at the bottom that provides a
connection point for the RGB LEDs so you
can remove it and then put it back on
and the LEDs will still work without
having to worry about additional wiring
I really like the i/o on this case for
full size USB 3.0 ports as well as a USB
type-c port and there's also some extra
buttons up there so you can control the
lighting effects and cycle through
different lighting modes internally as
you can see they have this set up with
the vertical GPU mount they're calling
it the chimney GPU mount again and that
motherboard tray has been rotated it can
rotate back so you can choose either
option rotate at 90 degrees and IO is
going to point down so you're gonna have
to route your cables out of there but it
does give a unique look and provides the
easy access for the ribbon cable to go
over to your chimney mounted graphics
cards so a pretty cool look in that and
fairly distinct so you can end up with a
massive build and keep it pretty
distinct as well with that different
orientation for the motherboard oh I
almost forgot to mention to match with
those front LEDs it's got some under
grillo RGB LEDs as
well one more case to show you guys this
one's also in development it's the SL
600 M and this is supposed to be a
silenced optimized case so it's going to
be a little bit more enclosed but
Coolermaster again is looking for some
feedback here this is actually has an
aluminum front and top and it's got a
sandblasted finish that I thought was
pretty nice it's not white it's a little
bit grayish it is aluminum but
coolermaster was kind of worried because
brushed aluminum everyone looks at and
says oh that's brushed aluminum this
what the sandblasted finish they said
people weren't recognizing it as
aluminum and since aluminum is generally
seen to be a more premium material than
your typical steel that's used in a case
they do want to show it off so let them
know if you think the aluminum is okay
as is I think it's fine with the
sandblasted finish the brushed aluminum
tends to pick up a lot of fingerprints
but of course your feedback is welcome
down in the comment section again though
this case is silence optimized so you're
not gonna see quite as many gaps or
spaces for air flow or mesh there's some
mesh along the top to provide some
ventilation up there and then down at
the bottom you'll notice that the case
is raised up a pretty good amount and
that's to provide plenty of space for
air intake down there this case
maintains the same front io connectivity
as the cosmos so for USB 3.0 ports a
type C port some controls there for your
RGB s and this one has an added feature
of a motion sensor so the case if it
goes to sleep the lights will go off and
you can just wave your hand over that IO
panel and it will light up so you can
see the ports that you need to plug in
and they've also have it connected up so
that the lights in the case turn on when
you do that - a pretty cool effect and
even maybe somewhat practical and in
certain situations rounding out the
silent features of this case though the
tempered glass has been lined with some
rubberized finish so that it won't have
any rattling or noise creation as it
rests up against the case if there's any
vibration going on and then they've also
chosen to mount the power supply at the
front of the case all the way at the top
so you can't really see it here but
that's where it is then they have a
extension cord that passes to the back
of the case so you can plug it in as you
normally would
next up we took a quick look at some
power supplies color masters bringing
back the V Series which has been around
for a while but they're refreshing it
first off they have the V Series
platinum line which is going to be
interesting for you if you are a minor
perhaps
enterprise user these are higher wattage
power supplies ranging from 850 watts
all the way up to 1200 watts and they
are of course 80 plus platinum rated so
extremely efficient they also come with
a double ball bearing fan which is one
of the higher quality types of fans you
can have especially for longevity and
being really high end power supplies
they come with a 10 year warranty from
coolermaster next to that was the XG 750
a pretty unique power supply because it
has a dual layer LED display on the side
of it and that can just show you the
power supply load it can show you the
power supply temperature or it can just
switch over to displaying the name of
the power supply the XG 750 I don't
believe this is an RGB power supply it
had purple LEDs on the fan as well as
that side display but there's a chance
I'm wrong about that moving around
though we saw the v-series gold power
supplies and these are definitely geared
more towards gamers being 550 watts a
750 watt range this is gonna come in
black which has a nice clean design
fully modular of course all the features
that you would expect from a nice power
supply from color master and they had a
white version there too which I really
liked I think they should go ahead with
the white version but again they're
looking for some feedback here so like
clear master now if you're interested in
a white power supply and also what
cables you think would go nicely with it
if they're gonna make this premium they
didn't talk specifically about having
sleeved cables or anything but they were
asking about the color should it be all
whites possibly even gray I think gray
would be a nice match with this and
would be an easy way to give your system
some pop without necessarily having to
spend a lot of money and finally let's
check out some keyboards and bear in
mind for the video here there's some
flickering going on that's completely
because of the camera and the frame
rates in person these LEDs are perfectly
smooth and stable first off is the MK
730 though this is a baby brother for
the Mk 750 which you may have seen on my
channel before it's just a 10 kilos
version of the MK 750 everything's
pretty much the same otherwise Cherry MX
switches magnetic wrist wrist RGB LEDs
on the key caps as well as the accent
strip across the front a very nice
premium keyboard and they've even
updated the top panel so it's got
brushed and sandblasted aluminum on
there so that was pretty distinct next
to that was a CK series there's a 640
630 and 620 so three different sizes
these are Cherry MX
slim switches they're about 35% slimmer
standard carry switches while still
maintaining pretty much the same feel
from what I could tell so you get a nice
low-profile keyboard here these also
have a hybrid Wireless design so you can
use them in a wireless mode or if the
battery is running low you can plug them
in the ones they had on demo because
there were early units didn't have USB
type-c but they said they are going to
add that for the actual launch version
the CK series also has a very nice
brushed aluminum top plate so I thought
that looked pretty clean as well finally
here's a quick look at the CK 3:7 - a
little bit more specific one standard
cherry switches on this one a stealth
design though so if you look at it from
the top you can't see any of the key cap
labels but those are actually on the
side so move down to the side you got
the key cap labels and of course still
RGB LEDs so it's gonna shine through
there and I guess if you forget where
your keys are you just kind of I kind of
crouch down and then you can spot them
but guys that is gonna wrap it up for my
coverage of the Coolermaster booth here
at Computex 2018 so thank you so much
for watching and a huge thank you to my
sponsors for this event coolermaster as
well as gigabyte team group and
Thermaltake I've got more Computex
videos coming at you very soon so hit
