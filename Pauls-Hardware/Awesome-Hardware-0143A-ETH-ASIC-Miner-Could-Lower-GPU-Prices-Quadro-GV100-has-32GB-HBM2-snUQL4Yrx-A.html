need them most like I need a thumb drive
and then it's like oh I remember this
I'm Jan takes you back hey everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware this is a
live show
we talk about technology computers but
otherwise as well we drink some beer
occasionally we use foul language so um
you know close your ears or hide the
kids and loved ones and all that kind of
thing we split the show into half so
you're watching the first half of
episode 143 right now 143 actually 148
we accidentally did episode hundred
forty-four last week so we have flipped
this week to do 143 it's kind of like we
went back in time but not exactly so
that's that's up in other words you're
getting your tech news today from two
guys who don't know how to count yeah
pretty much pretty much Wow that's
fairly choppy on oh hey yeah on YouTube
there I was gonna say it looks really
good but maybe it let's see it looks it
looks clean the chop is real though
right chapped is absolutely straight
like through the roof maybe is that was
choppy same bit rate so we are connected
Ethernet yeah yes good go away Windows I
always always like saying pick a time to
do the updates and then I closed it till
it never when it closed it immediately
okay there is no never option would that
be nice it's only choppy when we talk
okay we'll have a episode of silence
just once just this once to appease the
Internet guys
oh you can't you can't change on the fly
all right give us just a sec guys we'll
be right back is javi take us all right
sorry about that twitch twitch viewers
and anyone who's watching still chopping
it still still choppy what did you
change i just upped the bitrate from
fire it was in the five thousand range
die upped it to seven thousand is it
possible that it's just the internet
right now or it's never done this yeah
we've never had quite this much trouble
if it is the inner and definitely not
it's definitely an outlier yeah today's
episode we'll be showing you how to
troubleshoot an Internet problem yep on
the fly hello Internet does it exist
alright yes let's let's try this then
I'll try one more thing guys we'll be
right back I don't think it's the
Internet I think it something to do with
our settings somehow possible okay honey
I'll give that a try
got 16 gigs
our CPUs pretty high maybe it's just the
CPU it could be I think I still have a
good core i5 in there this is an i-5
6500 yeah
which only has 4 cores right
no hyper threading no hyper threading so
it's entirely possible that going from
32 6-day yes over the edge that fixed it
so absolutely yeah you tube is much
smoother now it's gotta be this - you
all right look forward to a screaming PC
upgrade on my channel nothing soon
the reason computer sheer necessity okay
so figured it out I guess welcome
everyone to awesome art yeah hey I kind
of did the intro already I'm not sure
what the beginning of this video is
gonna look like but I'm looking at our
stream now it does seem like we fixed
the main problem in case you're
wondering what the problem is the system
that are streaming on is an i-5 6500
which is a quad core without
hyper-threading and it does seem like we
were hitting the upper range of what
that CPU is capable of when it comes to
dual streaming at the same time - both
twitch and YouTube so we've dropped to
30 frames per second and we have lower
the bitrate a bit and it does seem like
we smooth things out I'm kind of excited
because I've been looking for a reason
to upgrade that system it's probably had
the same specs since I don't know two
years or something like that I've just
never needed to upgrade it until now and
I yeah I mean we've only just greatly
got a doing fire sauce so we've only
just recently started attempting to
stream at 60 frames per second right so
there you go all right
well it'll frames no problems as good
old biggie upgraded streaming system for
Kyle coming soon in the meantime I can
finally pour my beer I've been waiting
you to pour my beer what are you driving
today Paul I'm drinking this lovely beer
that wifey sauce went and picked up or
Lee did for me oh Jesus oh what the fuck
sweet mother of mercy
[Laughter]
okay that's it why do I have the worst
luck with bottles on this stream this is
the smoothest beginning of the show that
we've ever had Oh Cal's holding the beer
over the trash can actual fuck sort of
sipping out the top a little bit morning
right I did
oh that's sour give me a sec that is a
sour sour my god oh good paper towels
very handy Cal very very handy to have
the paper towels ready to go now
this is actually completely intentional
yeah man yeah meant to give us a smooth
and easy segue over to talking about our
our stuff that we sell like for instance
this this mouse mat the Kyle's using
right now demonstrating its efficacy in
absorbing liquid which it did with ease
and I'm sure we'll have a lovely scent
of whatever sour beer Kyle is drinking
for the near future so I'm assuming
you're really impressed with our live
show so far so feel free to order some
some gear my phone's everywhere my store
is pulsar Burnett shirts mugs pint
glasses other other useful things bottle
opener actually the bottle opener sold
out got order I guess we gotta order
some more bottle openers sorry no bottle
openers but you can get the beer set
still anyway check that out order stuff
Kyle over on Kyle's store has new shirts
made for really skinny people it seems
why are these whatsits so skinny unless
John it's very skinny shirt but look
it's a brand new design on my store
never before seen as an evil keyboard
and mouse attacking this poor
defenseless gamepad yep very sad this is
the the she'll be known as the ribbon
rip
gamepads shirt the rip gamepad design
this is actually designed by our good
friend Tina who used to work with us at
new AG - okay I might have seen you guys
in early version or an early mock-up of
this design which is so totally
different and then Tina and I worked on
it for for quite a while after that and
I think we're both really happy with how
it turned out so if you guys would like
to support the channel and you like the
design feel free to buy shirt there it
is high-quality stuff if you buy stuff
from us we will shut your name out at
the end of the show and it's it's ever
so much fun yes I never said which beer
I'm drinking this is from clown shoes
brewery which makes a wide variety of
very very good beer oh my god this is
11.5% sorry what are you trying to do
Heather bought it why is that get it you
can thank wifey sauce this is a Russian
Imperial Stout and Heather's apparently
trying to kill me this is the blade corn
Yuna dragon Russian Imperial Stout a the
the image on here you guys probably
can't see it's gonna be out of focus
that one before it's really really good
it's quite good and it's got a cool
picture every name I'm drinking a broken
wand which is an American dark sour ale
Oak fodder aged with raspberries from
magic factory council brewing or say to
you yeah
magic factory cancel brewing it's really
good which makes it a damn shame that I
wasted half of it on my desk floor and
mousepad you can also pick up from the
store because things are not beer proof
clearly thank you for the demo Kyle but
yes
Cheers to all of you drinking with us or
no Andrew drinking out of Kyle's glasses
right these are the glasses available on
Cal store
hashtag add it with logo oh that's
really good
really we are done pimping our products
right uh so let's move on to first
segment which is gonna be news for me
this is the news Nvidia GT C ignition
because in videos this week is hosting
GT see the GeForce technology conference
not to be confused with GDC the Game
Developers Conference which happened
last week was that last week we Kurt is
a week we can have a go
there was a keynote earlier today
ken-san
went up and talked front of a bunch of
people gave some demos long story short
no mention of any new graphics cards
coming out from Nvidia at least consumer
side graphics cards so the rumors of
like Oh videos gonna I mean who knows
maybe think it's still good later in the
conference of some pretty but pretty
much probably not gonna happen so we
were Marissa like a 2000 series or
whatever being being announced or
confirmed here seem to have not
materialized on top of that at least in
the keynote there was also no discussion
around GPP the g4s partner program that
we've talked about a little bit on the
show for the past couple weeks and has
also been lots of discussion about
online a bit controversial not going to
go into it right now but if you want to
check out last week's show we did we did
discuss that a little bit they also
didn't discuss GPU shortages at all and
the difficulty in buying a graphics card
for your typical gamer right now which
kind of sucks more of that later in my
half though Jensen did mention at one
point that the Titan V was sold out so
they're very proud that their $3,000
volta based graphics card is actually
able to sell because anything that can
mine worth a damn right now will sell
apparently but maybe not forever first
off though the big announcements the big
actual graphics card that they're
launching is big volta coming to requite
row so this is the Quadro GV 100 and
it's based around a V 100 which is the
big full 2 GPU which has only recently
been available in the tight V as well as
some tesla cards a tesla be 100 tests
will be 100 is a very expensive card
it's about $8,000 that's been out for a
little bit but the announcement was not
just that they're taking that v100 and
making a Quadro out of it the Quadro DV
100 but also that all of the V 100 based
GPUs are doubling their HBM to memory
stacks so prior to now the Tesla and it
was available with 16 gigs of HBM to
memory now that doubling that 32 since
since HP m is integrated under the
substrate with the GPU and everything
they have to manufacture that all
together so it's not like they can I
mean Nvidia manufactures all these
anyway but it's it's not like they could
offer the a third party GPU integrator
adoptions just change up the amount of
memory that's available or something
like that so I thought thought we were
having a hard time getting HP m2 yields
apparently in this step and now 32 gigs
on a single card well never will never
like last year I shortened the
discussion as we were waiting for for HP
m to become more readily available and
like the Vega launch and everything's
like oh maybe the ramp-up HP in
production and then everyone just
stopped caring because it was like just
let us buy a graphics card and I guess
in the meantime they have done something
with the bridge of their HP m2
production that or this is just a class
of card that ships in a much lower
volume than your typical you know there
will be two more gaming great graphics
cards so maybe there's fewer of them or
maybe something in between but the core
GPU at the heart of this is the same 12
nanometer v 100 voltage GPU as in that
$8,000 Tesla V 100 so it's still got
5120 CUDA cores 640 tenths of cores 320
texture he 128 ROPS 1450 megahertz is
the boost clock but increasing that
memory stack allows a lot more it makes
a lot more capable of handling the types
of data workloads that's you might
actually do on these cards simulations
that use lots of video memory basically
I I don't want to expand on that because
they might get something wrong the
memory though the memory stack is 32
gigs of 4096 bit 1.7 gigabit per second
HBM - video memory full ECC
error-correcting which is very important
when you're doing this type of thing
crazy amounts of raw horsepower 7.4
teraflops double precision 14.8
teraflops single precision 250 watt TDP
so no change there really and if you
guys want some more details the ax man
tech article going over this is linked
in the video's description this is for
now the only quadric card that's using
the Volta architecture that means it's
the only card to support hardware
retracing acceleration and we did talk
about ray tracing stuff on Kyle's top of
the show last week so I'm not gonna go
into that again right now again there's
more on that and the article if you
wants to read up on its and that
supports invidious new r-tx technology
which was also discussed today and at
the very ends they didn't at the events
say what the price was going to be but
that apparently has been made public
$9,000
Oh $9,000 so it's not eight it's nine
yeah
so well no no these two the the the
Tesla the team oh the Tesla v100 the
Tesla V 100 sells for 8,000 I think it
still sells for 8 that was not sure I
don't know if the new Tesla Tesla V the
new Tesla of v1000 V 100 I don't know if
the new test of V 100 cards that have
double the amount of memory are still
gonna sell for 8 or for 8,000 mm-hmm I'm
not sure about that but I see and I'd
still hear more details a ton of money
forthcoming but yeah a lot of my
speaking lots of money how about you
want a bunch of those all built together
in a system for you by Nvidia and call
it the VG x2 and sell it for $400,000
and also call it a graphics cooler
hundred thousand dollars yeah it's not a
graphics card this is I don't know who
was thinking this as a graphics card it
is not I made a joke about this on
Twitter earlier I said I said we've
found out that the GX 2 immediately sold
out and is now available on eBay for
$800,000 I thought that was a funny joke
great because that's what happens with
the graphics cards yeah some people
thought I was there I think some people
thought I was serious I think w-c-c if
tech picked it up as
anyway the the box the unit itself was
shown up on stage I mean it's it's
sizable but I'm fairly small when you
consider the actual amount of power
that's involved here bear mine we're the
only basis for comparison that we have
here really to discuss is the VG x1 from
last year which was 150,000 dollars and
actually when you look at the raw
performance depending on what you're
doing with it of course it scales in a
somewhat linear fashion so it's not like
I was I was watching some discussion on
Twitter earlier from people who are
smarter than me and the non tech guys
basically and I think Ryan said it's
basically the same amount of raw
performance but depending on whether you
you're depending are doing something
that's easily split up across a couple
nodes or multiple nodes or something
that you need to be handled on one
machine may make like a couple dgx ones
or a single d/dx - more or less viable
for you and I'm sure all of you guys out
there are right on the verge of placing
your order so total compute performance
is 1920 teraflops that's in that's
tensor processing which is more specific
so not Universal across all GPU compute
applications but 480 teraflops of
floating-point 16 performance 248
teraflops of FP 32 performance it's in
the Box are 16 Tesla V 100 GPUs the DG
x1 had 8 so double the number of GPUs
you get 1 point 5 terabytes of system
ram the original DG x1 only had half a
terabyte so you get 3 times the amount
of system ram which is nice 30 terabytes
of nvme storage DG x1 had 8 terabytes
and you get a pair of Xeon Platinum CPUs
which are extremely expensive in their
own right all this is made possible by
invidious envy switch technology which
enables 300 gigabytes per second chip to
chip communication that's 12 times the
throughput of PCI Express they pair that
with NV linked to that only
all 16 GPUs to be grouped together in a
single system for total bandwidth going
beyond 14 terabytes per second saying
these are all numbers that if you don't
look at numbers and like you know a
server grade hardware and what it's
capable of
might not make that much sense to you
but these are all pretty impressive
numbers granted they're paired with a
very expensive price tag so you get what
you pay for but this is being touted by
a name I'm sorry by Nvidia as a to
petaflop capable system via the 80 1920
cuda cores that are integrated across
all those GPUs and 10240 tensor
processing cores it's gonna use 10
kilowatts of power while it's in
operation and the whole system weighs
350 pounds can you mind on it Sebby of
course you can mind with it you can mind
with combined with just but you can mind
with hard drives we learned recently
from a - this video oh yeah you can find
with this - yes so there's there's
article from tech power up linked in the
description if it gets on a little bit
more information on that would take you
a while to break even though everyone
should buy yeah buy at least three five
three or four all right can it run
Crysis agenda now already I already
mentioned there were no consumer grade
graphics announcements so kind of
disappointed there but I guess it's kind
of a consolation they did a demo at the
end of the keynote live stream that I
thought was pretty cool so I wanted to
show you guys here and this is I don't
know I saw a tweet from Nvidia Drive
which is there does their automotive
stuff they called this the project
Wakanda which is you know like like a
like Black Panther I'm not sure if
that's an official name for it or
anything but Jensen was trying to
explain what was going on while he was
on stage and I was sitting there and
probably lots of people were like anyone
who's seen Black Panther has seen this
happen just recently because in Black
Panther and then the gosh I forget a
name know that you're not giving us any
spoilers right now I know but they have
a remote driving capability there's a
there's a technology where it creates
the synthesize seat and she sits down
and then it creates a thing around her
and suddenly she's sitting in a car
but the cars on the other side of the
world they have this fancy thing they
just throw in the car that suddenly
turns it into an autonomous
remote-controlled vehicle and video
still needs to get on top of working on
that technology but for now and this is
actual knots you know not part of a
movie or something like that they did a
live demo of this Nvidia drive or
project Wakanda or also referred to as
the holodeck because what you're seeing
here is a virtualized holodeck there's a
car in the middle there and that's a
virtual thing the images that you're
seeing around the edges are being sent
in from remote cameras that are actually
installed in a car that's out near the
facility where they're running this demo
so there's a real car there's a virtual
car in the VR environment and there's a
dude with an oculus rift and the setup
here doing the VR so Wow yeah so he sees
as if he's in the virtual VR
environments what he is seeing is the
cameras and everything on the car that
are is actually looking at the
everything around it and he is able to
remotely control this car and drive it
it's really cool and that was pretty
cool
now granted he like drives like a
grandma through a parking lot and then
perks I would to shit I don't blame the
guy we go so he drives very slowly but
he can see a shot from inside the car of
like the car turning the wheel and
everything you can see his view I guess
not a very good capture of his view or
whatever but yeah world is tearing any
any parks and no one no one was killed
so thank goodness that's the good news
anyway so given how often Nvidia goes
and talks about their autonomous driving
stuff at their keynotes and everything
and it's it's like I'm always torn about
it because I know this is future
technology that's gonna happen and it's
going to be everywhere and I can see why
Nvidia is investing so much time and
resources into it but it's still less
exciting for me most of the time than
like the new graphics card or something
but seeing an implementation of like a
bit like this was was pretty sweet
and yeah article Conda alright that's
the end of my first segment next up
we're gonna we're gonna do sword fight I
don't have a lower thirds for Sarge
faint hold on I can fix that
there you go you are Hades okay sorry
sorry
we we haven't we haven't done so far in
a while but I needed something button
but I needed something topical and
controversial for us to discuss so we're
gonna we're gonna discuss something
somewhat weighty here mm vaguely depends
depends how seriously you take yourself
I guess cake or pie right right
almost Facebook you guys have probably
read up some of the Facebook news just
recently and yes this does reach into a
broader territory that we don't usually
delve into on the show so we're not
really gonna dive into the Facebook and
its potential effect on global
geopolitical landscape or anything like
that although that's definitely worth
discussing but the stuff from Facebook
just this over the past weekend and this
I believe was broke by a Ars Technica
and the articles linked in the
description is people were people have
gotten into deleting Facebook lately
they like I don't like what they're
doing I don't like the tracking that's
being done with me I don't like all this
stuff and whenever I go on Facebook I
just get depressed anyway so I I don't
want to do it so people have been using
the various tools that Facebook makes
available to pull their data off of it
because you know people have pictures
and whatever and then want to save that
for the for the future turns out when
you go and pull your Facebook data
there's a lot of stuff in there
Facebook tracks you in many many
different ways including tracking your
actual phone call and sms data on your
phone like if you're an Android user and
you have the Facebook app installed it
just I mean there might be permissions
that are available too
excuse me disable this but basically all
of your call logs are there
and you might think to yourself you know
what no one besides my phone and my my
my you know my wireless provider should
should have access to this
how come Facebook seems like they're
they they should have access to Hoover
it up and everything they've been
burying responses to this I guess hey I
guess Zuckerberg recently said like oh
well if it was in the fine print like
that's what people signed up for like
they gave us permission buried there and
all that text that everyone surely reads
they rid of it but anyway the the
question the large the larger question
here that we're gonna discuss and we can
post this in chat and everything for you
guys to argue over as well is what's the
solution to this obviously this is an
issue to some degree depending on who
you are and what's been done to you but
how do we solve this that's what we're
all about is bringing you solutions and
solving problems thank you cell by the
way for being here and modding for us
and posting links in the description
cool
so Kyle and I are gonna take a couple
opposing sides here we'll argue about it
feel free to vote yourself you can vote
now or you can wait until you hear
arguments just sway your opinion what's
the solution now we have a couple
fundamental like political stances here
we got the government regulation right
the government needs to go in there the
government needs to tell these companies
you can't do that what you can and
cannot do force them because they're not
gonna do it themselves it's already been
proven or got the free market option for
you libertarian libertarians out there
because you know consumers right
Facebook is only gonna make money as
long as people are using it people get
pissed off because they found out about
Facebook doing shady stuff we can stop
using Facebook Facebook doesn't make
money we all go back to MySpace or
Friendster some some of their
alternative social media platform we
also have the option of course to just
stop stop using the social media
completely a little surprise in turn out
use move to a cabin in the woods
off-grid get one of those tiny houses my
wife keep watching keeps watching shows
about peeing a hole in the ground yep
do some get a mulch pile go on and have
30 kids
well that's no that's that's inefficient
no cuz you get it well I guess you gotta
work you gotta work I have someone to
work the plow it's true then of course
I've got the option for which is
everything's fine nothing's nothing's
wrong here everything's going just
peachy just groovy
I'm happy with my Facebook overlords
what do you think Kyle you get to go
first
oh god the options they're all so good I
wish I could choose them all jeez man
made it hard okay I'm gonna say the only
option is to stop using social media
completely probably the internet too who
needs it we were surviving just fine
dude we were doing just fine before the
internet came around and now that it's
here everyone's unhappy everyone's
miserable internet ruined everything
yeah it's how you and I get to make a
living which is awesome and provide for
our families but you know what if the
internet wasn't around we're humans we
adapt
I would I would work at a grocery store
and I was you know and you'd probably be
a stripper I don't know okay I can't say
for sure but I'm only 99% sure up but
can't go back to that way you did it
once you'll do it again Paul as long as
the price is right so I I just I just
don't you know social media I feel like
you know there's the mist can go on
forever like one of the reasons why
everyone's always saying well you know
how everyone's always saying like you
know like 15 years ago ten years ago
even nobody was as sensitive as they are
now like people just get triggered so
easily and and and my thinking every
time I hear that triggered you just had
triggered our using the word truth
pisses me off thank you for like come on
this is a great a loop here I hate you
net so my theory is that everyone's
always been this trigger they just now
have the means to communicate it to the
world completely anonymously everyone's
always been this sensitive
this much of a bitch they just now have
the power in their hands to tell
everyone about it because everyone cares
so much about what you think and you
know it's a lot of noise there have been
times where I've been like you know what
I'm gonna delete my Twitter account
like literally legitimately been like
who needs it I'm totally fine without it
and and I think it's just it's never
going to be a perfect solution like the
internet is always gonna cause problems
like this of privacy and you know
different rights and things like that so
I think I think we should just do away
with the Paul just do away with it all
together because we were just fine
without it it's causing more problems
than its solving okay a fine argument
made there for your choice channel I
have three other options to choose from
here and I'm gonna be perfectly honest I
mainly put all these up so I could see
what you guys thought about this so um
I'm gonna I'm gonna go I'm gonna go the
then choose the fascist route and say
government regulation because a really
fascist but did the government obviously
Facebook is out of control
Twitter is out of control Android's out
of control I I'm meant to simple
supplement my links today with a really
interesting thread that I came across on
Twitter of all of the stuff that Android
does to follow you and all the things
that you can do to go into your Google
Google account to see where you've been
and what you've done and all the
different things that Google has been
watching you do and using for whatever
purposes they might deem are legal
enough to get away with who knows but
the point is here these companies are
gonna keep doing this they're gonna take
advantage of us they set up this
honeypot like hey look we got a Google
Drive here and you just go use it for
free and like any time you got access to
the Internet you can just see all your
stuff and it's right there and Gmail's
got really good security and you know
you can create all these accounts and
Google and it's super handy and you're
like wow that's really convenient and
easy to use Google thank you and then
you use all this stuff then they turn
around and stab you in the back I don't
have a specific example of Google doing
that but since they've sort of veered
away from there don't be evil mentality
and philosophy
I don't trust them anymore although I do
use all that stuff so um point being
here
we need Uncle Sam to come in and do what
he does best
and tell us what to do we need we need a
we need a nanny state we need mother
mother to come in and help us build the
wall I think it's what that's a Pink
Floyd reference by the way not a ah just
it's like where is this coming from
yeah you're right I bet that could ease
that very easily could have been
misconstrued about me talking about
something else anyway um let's see what
y'all think about this and hopefully we
have solved this problem now once we
view the results what we do on the show
solve problems results solve world
problems
click work ah that's actually Wow super
close between waves to answer and we
wonder why this is a divisive time in in
our country right very close but it
looks like we have this slight edge for
people wanting the warm embrace of their
government to come and tell them
everything's just fine Wow a bunch of
sheep okay sheeples open your eyes
brothers out to get you if I'm being
honest I think there's some balance like
I don't I mean I don't want to get too
serious here and I get too serious here
but I find that when you when you do
what we have just done and try to look
at an argument from a binary perspective
of like there are only two options for
this granted I put four options so this
is it's falling apart but point being I
like balance I think there's I think
there's some level of regulation that
would keep the companies honest and from
doing shady stuff with with our with our
data because honestly there's there's
lots of really cool stuff that's done
with big data like the fact that I leave
my house without knowing where I'm going
then I just pull it up on a phone and
that all of the other people traveling
in the road can let me know how the
traffic's going and all that kind of
stuff there's lots of very useful things
to be done with big data but there's
also lots of ways that it can be taking
advantage of and used in ways that are
very manipulative and
we have to be very vigilant to make sure
that that's not being done to us and
it's a constant thing like it's never
gonna go away we will always need to be
one look out for that kind of thing all
right let's move on hi final segments on
my half of the show and I'm gonna try to
move through this relatively quickly is
tech of the day after tomorrow and
because I like my lower thirds I'm gonna
see if I have a little lower thirds for
this do it hey let's not fix this
one.beautiful thirds you can eat the ice
cream if you want okay so we're talking
about future technology and full
disclosure a variety of the things I'm
gonna discuss here we're taken from the
futurology subreddit which is quite
there's a few others in there too
speaking of the future perhaps you
should move over to using Mozilla
Firefox I have always used multiple
browsers and Firefox has been a mainstay
for me for quite some time and if you're
trying to avoid like the tracking and
stuff like from your firm your Google
Android overlords then maybe chrome
isn't the way you want to go granted
chrome was really good browser - I don't
make this about that but Firefox being
very topical has announced the Facebook
container extension so if you still need
to use Facebook if you have people you
would lose touch with if you didn't get
on there or if you have a business that
you need to manage that has a Facebook
page or something like that you can use
this extension with Firefox in order to
containerize your facebook login because
what Facebook does is it looks at all
the cookies from all the other different
websites you've been to and tracks what
you're doing to try to figure out who
you are and what you're doing and what
you need and what you like and what they
can sell to you basically this
containerized is your facebook login so
that as you were doing other stuff on
the internet Facebook is it tracking it
you can still have your facebook login
and you don't need to to worry about
that all the time and stuff so it seems
like a useful extension you know topical
that I'd point it out to you guys check
it out on the Mozilla blog or the link
in the description if you got some more
information this week next a wristband
that lets your brain control your
computer
with your thoughts now thoughts isn't
exactly it's not exactly it and I wish
they had a better picture than this this
is the only picture we have we're we're
dealing with this picture but pardon me
more to the point it's an electronic
bracelet right and it's a new way
potentially of interacting with your
computer all right there's one more
picture here's a picture down every one
look at that picture it's fast
why wouldn't they show I'm wearing the
bracelet I don't know it's the
Scientific American article they're big
on the words lots of words in science
and less in the pictures not a
photography website really so there we
go okay but it's a wristband that picks
up on really really tiny muscle
movements in order to give you a user
interface and there's gonna be lots of
potential applications for this it's
being developed by control labs ctrl
labs which is a startup which was
launched by the creator of Microsoft
Internet Explorer Thomas Frieden and
partners and they've demonstrated this
new approach for brain-computer
interface because when we're interacting
with a computer
there's the ways that we are familiar
with doing it typing in a keyboard you
keep using a mouse for example there are
newer ways that have been developed but
we haven't really seen anything that's
taken over so to speak like in the way
that a keyboard and mouse has unless you
switch over to perhaps the touch
interface that we use on the phones and
tablets and that kind of thing so this
wristband picks up on voltage bursts
that results from muscle fibers in the
arm when they contract so it's not
reading your mind or even detecting like
your synapses firing or like like your
nerves it's actually picking up on the
muscle movement but it's fine muscle
movement so there's a potential for that
to allow you to have fine control over
various things the demo as described in
the article basically described using
putting the wrist band on and lifting
the hand up and moving the hand around
and that was mimics or imitated by the
on-screen display now this is basically
showing software picking up the movement
of the hand and pick
that from the wristbands but then that
could be translated into for example if
you had a prosthetic or something like
that controlling that now from my
understanding and this is mainly for
miracle prosthetics that have mechanical
functions right now are typically
actually controlled by muscle movements
that actually would do something in the
way of like pushing a button or that
kind of thing so this is different in
the way that it picks up on the muscle
movements in the same way that like an
electrocardiogram would detect
electrical potentials of contracting
cardiac muscle yes I read that I
wouldn't I know it'll ne CG is
electrocardiogram but it's it's a
different way than human interface
devices have worked in the past so
that's pretty cool and the fact that
it's just a wristband means it's fairly
non intrusive and potentially maybe
could be used on other parts of the body
as well if we're talking about
interfaces that would use hands and feet
or something like that I'm not really
sure I just speculated on that right now
but the computer analyzes the electrical
discharges from the arm and hand muscles
use them to calculate the motion and
gripping force of the hand and then the
computer initiates the same movement
with a virtual hand and then of course
you could put that over to a robotic
hand or something like that if you
wanted to this is very unique in the
case of prosthetics because if you are
missing a limb or example for example
you might still be able to control the
fine muscle movements elsewhere on the
limb and that would give you very nice
control over something like a prosthetic
which is pretty cool the wear of the
wrist bands can in principle dance your
fingers in the air or even like you
could have them in your pocket and if
you knew the right movements like if you
remember it like you could have specific
movements that tied into like a keyboard
typing or something like that and if you
had the memorise you could possibly just
have your hands in your pockets switch
your fingers basically and communicate
or type something or that kind of thing
there's more examples in the article
again if you want to if you guys want to
check it out it's fairly interesting
lots of words let's see that's
definitely being picked up by VR yeah to
some degree they are perhaps at being
able to have like more granular control
with with your fingers and you know
being able to pick objects up without
needing a controller really I'm actually
using yeah
like that clear one is upon us oh yeah
things out this weekend that do all
right moving on batteries we all have
phones what not to use batteries and
battery life always sucks so researchers
at the University of Texas at Dallas
have developed a high-powered
environmentally safe lithium sulfur
substitute could drastically lengthen
battery life lithium sulfur batteries
have long been considered an evolution
from lithium ion batteries they're less
expensive to make they weigh less they
store almost twice the energy of lithium
ion batteries that are better for the
environment but there's problems with
them for example sloper is a poor
electrical conductor and can become
unstable over several charge and
recharge cycles so the article which is
from physic again like the description
talks about the potential options that
they've had for overcoming that's a
problem with lithium sulfur batteries
the researcher who is quoted who's dr.
gosh kg h o KJ KJ cho and her fellow
Reacher's researchers discovered that
molybdenum a metallic elements that's
often used to strengthen a hardened
steel creates a material that adjusts
the thickness of the coating when
combined with two atoms of sulfur
coating thinner than the silk of spire
of a spiderweb and they found that it
improved stability and compensated for
the pork and conductivity of the sulfur
that's allowing for greater power
density and making lithium sulfur
batteries more commercially about
available so I was hoping there would be
some more specifics when it comes to
like percentages or whatever but yeah
this seems like kind of a
work-in-progress thing but cool that
they're making progress on new battery
technology cuz we all want our cellphone
batteries to last longer that's true
alright moving on I thought this one was
pretty cool this is from quartz calm
this is the world's first negative
emissions plants which has begun turning
carbon dioxide into stone
yes so we humans produce 40 trillion
kilograms of carbon dioxide each year
and we are on track to cross the crucial
emissions threshold that this is going
to cause global temperatures to rise
past the two degrees Celsius limit which
is a point where many climate scientists
have said it's kind of that point of no
return it becomes a snowball effect to
the point where we keep or climate
change gets out of control and we all
die that's one of the main points of the
Paris climate agreements not that the
u.s. cares about that anymore but quite
being here there is hope potentially in
the future the technology is called
direct air capture which basically is
like others there's carbon dioxide in
the air just capture the air take the
carbon dioxide out it sounds pretty
simple right
however can be very cost and effective
very expensive so direct air capture
technologies have been in development
for quite some time but this is the
first time that they've actually kicked
off a carbon a negative emission plant
that is carbon negative which is pretty
cool
it works like a tree that's a very very
simple way of putting it but the trees
suck carbon dioxide out of the air but
it's much more efficient than a tree to
date all estimates have suggested that
direct air capture would be exhibited li
exorbitantly expensive to deploy for the
past decade there's been a group of
entrepreneurs partially funded by Bill
Gates of Microsoft Edgar Bronfman jr.
jr. of Warner Music and the late Gary
comer of Lands End
they've all been working to prove that
this might be commercially viable
because hey if we can just suck all the
the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere
then we can all just burn all the fossil
fuels we want hey be awesome all you
have to do is be a billionaire so there
are three primary companies that have
been working on this there was a fourth
I guess but they ran out of funding
Switzerland's climb works canada's
carbon engineering and the US has global
thermostat and they've all built they're
all working on building machines that at
reasonable costs can capture co2
directly from
and on October 11th which is a while
back but this article's recent I don't
know why they're just just dropping the
news now but on October 11th AG at a
geothermal power plant in Iceland
inaugurated climb works inaugurated the
first system does direct air capture and
verifiably achieves negative carbon
emissions this is still a pilot project
so right now an operation it's capturing
50 metric tons of co2 from the air each
year which is about the same that's
emitted by a single US household for the
course of a year so it's a small amount
but it's still a significant amount and
apparently one u.s. household does the
same amount of co2 emissions as 10
Indian households I believe it which is
no no we're using we're emitting a lot
less oh we're emitting one we're
emitting 10 times less than India but
this is this is advances in efficiency
and what we are burning for fuel I
imagine anyway don't a sidetrack onto
that this is the first system also that
converts these emissions into stone
it takes carbon dioxide out of the air
and makes it into stone which ensures
that it doesn't escape back into the
atmosphere and they're showing that
direct if direct air capture can be made
cheap enough for there to be commercial
interest pardon me then the economics of
carbon capture at point sources will
likely work because right now this is a
facility that's specifically designed to
do this but what they're talking about
is taking this technology going to the
points where the carbon emissions are
coming from the factories were and
creating equipment that can do the
removal of the carbon right there where
we're at the source mm-hmm and again
more on the article if you guys want to
read up on that
I I'll be honest at first when I read
the headline I thought they meant I
thought they were talking about like a
vegetation plant mmm that was able to
turn carbon dioxide into stone and I
thought that was really trippy but a
power plant makes a lot more sense to me
now
there's there and it's not necessarily a
power plant it's a geothermal site so
they're actually using I believe it uses
heat geothermal heat
to power the process which is probably
helps with them being carbon negative
that's pretty cool
yeah all right let's move on I don't
have very many notes on this but if
anyone is doing much with augmented
reality virtual reality there's a new
thing here that's described in this
inverse comm article which is virtual
wearables and this speaking of ready
player one it kind of reminded me of
like some of that kind of thing like
Google glass people got people got sick
of Google glass right because everyone
walking around with it kind of look like
a douche bag but the viability of
swearing glasses for some sort of
augmented reality type thing seems like
it might be kind of cool look so look at
this this is just a tweet like that
alone I'm sold right that's it you guys
stop the video right there it's gonna
get worse from here on out but just the
flip and the thing the UI popping up
done pull your hand out by one right now
if we order to act with it do you pull
it out that's it that's the future
that's their future virtual wearable and
they're doing this it's already annoying
seeing people on their phones like the
phones in their hand now we won't even
be able to see what they're looking at
yeah that's not even fair let's be
watching porn in the elevator like right
next to you that's super creepy there's
a you probably will too so whatever yeah
I mean as long as you can't see it
depends if you have the audio on I guess
where your hands are the arv are having
being able to interact with something
that it appears on your hand like I
don't know if there's any like like if
there's just sales you know what be
really trippy is if you could use like
real life real-world skins or mods so if
you wanted everyone around you to look
like an alien then you could just deploy
a mod or a skin and now all of a sudden
you ever gain skin everyone has you know
everyone looks like Iron Man they have
that crap what's it called it's a it's a
machine learning tool where you can take
any video and swap the face out okay
what's the name of it
I can't it's a website right yeah it's I
think I think there's a website where
you can go I've only read about it I
haven't I haven't done it and looked
into it directly but they're deep fakes
deep fakes Thank You Chet I knew chat
would deep fakes they're just yeah it's
a the line is talked about a little bit
I think I think a little one text they
discuss it a little bit there as well
but it's just the idea that the software
and machine learning is getting so
intelligent that you can take a video it
knows what a person looks like it knows
what a face looks like it can track I
can automatically pick up with the video
and look like alright there it is
there's the face and then you can take
it and say here's someone else's face
you can pick all right swap it up and
put that face on that business name so
what you're talking about the reason I
brought that up is like something like
this
like what if you had that software that
like alright I'm walking around I want
everyone to be Paul to be Paul J or
something like that suddenly everyone's
face looks like that one's just a
dickhole today really confusing if this
becomes widespread because you won't
know what other people are seeing
compared to what you're seeing or what
happens if people can now hack it so
someone who robs a bank hacks everyone
at the bank to see somebody else's fan
j-just riding a pony J's like I was at
home and the only person who knows the
truth is the one who didn't get like the
eye implants or whatever oh my god black
mirror sees next season so it's gonna
give a black mare good lord we could
write this shit virtual wearables coming
coming soon India a couple things this
was discussed at GDC last week leap
motion is involved and they do a hand
shock tracking software and stuff like
that there's also some discussion of
using the hand tracking software from
leap motion with VR devices like oculus
rift or five so that you can use just
your hands rather than having control
which leap has actually had they've
they've been doing that for a while I
imagine but at this point they've
probably expanded on that and made it
better in some in some ways
moving on link of the day after tomorrow
anyone here from China
China is I've only visited mainland
China once but in Shenzhen over there
they have surveillance cameras and they
probably have tracked your face and know
who you are Cal damn it they have
surveillance cameras that do face
tracking and identification that's
tagged people who are jaywalking and
stuff like that and apparently publicly
shamed them to some degree that is so
China of them but now they've expanded
this and you immediately get a text
message that says you terrible person
you've jaywalk now you're gonna get fine
but texts of like you jaywalking and
just text you the picture of you parents
yeah I mean that's that's what they
would do this is one of those things I
mean if you look at the narrow scope of
this story it's like okay jaywalkers in
China are now gonna get a text message
what they're fine though the broader
scope here more is is more in the like
first off it's kind of convenient though
right and we don't talk about this much
of the show I know I know we have people
who watch in the US as well as otherwise
but I'm never quite sure how much people
in the US are familiar with or like how
familiar people in the US are with like
with China and stuff like that
sometimes I get varying feedback from
people and I talked to them about China
and sometimes people's impression of
China is that it's still very agrarian
and rural and not very advanced and then
other times the types of people who are
more familiar with what China is doing
right now and China especially if we go
to the big cities is very advanced in a
lot of ways more advanced in the US and
in the fact they in fact they have
implemented stuff like face tracking
technology in different areas and it
seems like they are potentially
expanding that and I don't know it's
just one of those things that is
probably gonna happen in the US as well
it's probably already happening in the
u.s. to some degree in specific areas
like high traffic areas for
FBI and that kind of thing then aim I
don't want to get into much speculation
beyond that I think I'm say like that
after thinking about it like that'd be
really convenient if you were gonna get
a ticket for something to just get it in
a
next right instead of like having like
like oh crap did I like open that piece
of mail did it get thrown away like just
just just text me dude and I'll just pay
it on my phone like I think that's it
that's a further maybe you should just
not jaywalk that is a feature I'm Jeff
and the other thing I agree with is that
you shouldn't be jaywalking in China cuz
they're out then the roads they're
freaking nuts you can J walk in
California you want anywhere in the
States pretty much but don't do it in
China that should be illegal one other
should be one of the things I remember
about Beijing you'll die on my trip
there is there's roses everywhere all of
the main streets in Beijing are aligned
with just thousands of rose bushes and
they're blooming and there's like people
going along attending them and
everything and it's all clean air
quality varies depending on the day and
everything the next day all the roses
but but I was like holy crap this is the
rose like beautiful blooming rose bushes
and let's move on I love their flowers
one more started to discuss real quick
and this is yeah this still falls into
the TEC of the day after tomorrow
gamer's Nexus article here about a bit
Maine acing minor which potentially
potentially has the possible impact on
the market of reducing the desire of
minors to get gaming GPUs now that's
speculative we don't know if that's the
case Steve and his article here who's
very diligent in making sure he's saying
that this may reduce gaming GPU demand
not even going so far as to say reducing
prices but let's just say that when it
comes to coin mining aetherium has had a
significant impact on GPU pricing simply
because it is a very popular
cryptocurrency to mine it's effectively
mind with GPUs and it's popula nuf that
the value has scaled a lot of the time
along with Bitcoin Bitcoin is
impractical to mine with anything
besides an ASIC far asa
a bunch of Asics but the fact that there
is an ASIC minor for Assyrian could mean
that people will now veer towards that
instead of GPU mining let's this article
source is cnbc.com
and it was written by analyst
Christopher Roland and he slashed the
price of AMD and NVIDIA stock there his
expected price of a named AMD Nvidia
stock based on this because he said look
if there's another viable option for
mining cryptocurrency then the sale the
the rate of sales and everything that
we've seen with graphics cards should
possibly drop as a result we don't know
if there's going to be some sort of
replacements for for aetherium that
comes out or anything like that but the
market at least for today has spoken
it looks like nvidia is down 18 almost
19 points about 7.7 percent and AMD is
down about four point two percent so
granite that's the stock market and
everything so and stock market will
often react very quickly to something
whereas the actual result of something
might take a little bit longer but I'm a
noob took the ASIC stuff for mining like
is that gonna require memory like video
memory like is ddr4 gonna be needed for
the ASIC at all typically a6 solutions
you you would buy as a as I'm like a you
buy a mining ASIC block and it's usually
a power supply and the processor and the
ASIC and whatever is also all included I
know there's people who DIY this type of
thing I've never looked into that so I
don't want to speak on it as far as
what's possible but the ASIC itself is
something that needs to be manufactured
and you need a fab in order to do that
and it needs to be designed specifically
to efficiently process the workload of
something like aetherium mining and
that's been challenging from my
understanding until now if
has been very a sick resistant but if
they can manufacture a chip that's
really good at mining aetherium and does
it very efficiently then the desire for
mining what GPUs is going to go out the
window because you're going to have
people who are making more money due to
better efficiency and if Asics start
flooding the market and actually
increases the total effective mining
that's going towards aetherium in
general it's gonna increase the
difficulty of it it's gonna make it less
and less effective for you mining with
your same graphics card that you've been
mining with for the past six months or
year yeah I get that
I just mean if like Asics still require
memory and we're still in a VRAM
shortage it doesn't help us getting more
GPUs even if the demand for GPUs goes
down if basics really take off and
they're really great for mining then
it's still gonna be pulling from the
same pool of memory and we're still
gonna see shortages it's happened to GPU
social system memory still required I
don't know if it uses ddr3 or ddr4 or
what so I'm not sure but yes I know some
memory would be necessary but yeah well
we'll see what happens further details
perhaps to come in the future but I
didn't want to end my half of the show
by doing some reality checking I've done
a what do graphics card costs segments
and I actually saw earlier today some
people tweeting that on eBay you could
get like a 1070 or 1070 T I used for not
quite MSRP but just slightly more than
MSRP like four or 450 yeah so we're just
on the this is just eBay and I'm just
gonna go over here to Nvidia and see
what ten let's see what ten 70s are
going forward like right now this is
best match right we need first buy it
now thank you and let's sort by lowest
price let's scroll past all the things
that aren't actually graphics cards but
that have been listed in the graphics
cards category in the hope of someone
being like Oh
my gosh I really needed this life only
$50 for this graphic skirt now it's SLI
bridge douchebag judo now two listings
in the proper category at eBay I hate
you all point being damn dude that one's
for parts to repair that was a count
that is uh please read description
probably also not working alright here's
a ZOTAC here's the zotac 8 gig for $435
now that's not MSRP MSRP is supposed to
be sub 400 but it's not mattress that's
that's within 40 bucks or so so this is
this is tolerable this is good it is
I mean graded used used for less than a
week I guess I mean yeah hey hey hey I
wonder how does it how does everyone
just kind of know like what's the
process like is it because retailers are
now selling a cheaper and so and so now
that official retailers a game is on New
Ager selling them for cheaper everyone
on eBay is like oh I have to put mine
lower how does that work or does the
resale are these eBay Pete sellers the
ones that are sort of never I was never
a product manager at new it cuz I have
no idea how this type of thing is
determined great it's like they all kind
of knew like they all just had this like
telepathic hey we should all lower our
prices 1070 FDA here is a Buy It Now GTX
1084 $550
ok that's pretty solid there it goes up
to 600 which is I mean what is that what
is that it go a gigabyte GT X 1080 xti
sized I didn't know this is not real
this is what I'm at home I what the fuck
is this shroud it's just one giant ass
fan Wow
four six no but this is like it I think
I think Greg from science studio does a
series where he just goes on and finds a
we're - basically does what you just did
a minute ago looks like how its genius
investor cruising it's great as serious
as you get alright so hopefully
hopefully in fallujah GP prices will
come down
I mean there there is this
theoretical inflection point where
suddenly graphics cards suck for mining
when suddenly the market gets flooded
with old GPUs and suddenly you can buy a
1074 like well below $400 I don't know
if we're gonna hit that we can hope we
can keep our fingers crossed I was
saying that that GPU is perhaps from a
Norris external GPU enclosure like one
of those GPU does okay yeah I guess that
would make sense which he probably
bought for me I don't know five hundred
dollars with the tens
hey who knows who knows but all right
that's all I got for my half we're gonna
quickly run down some Q&amp;amp;A questions that
have been asked I'm gonna try to run
through these quick Scott dalvik $6 66
cents ready cheers to you Scott thanks
man automatic Matt hey Matty five dollar
donation
he says busy tonight something for my
CCNA to exam so I won't be able to catch
the show live tonight
I'm sorry oh he's studying Matt say mr.
net but I approve of your diligence
indeed Steven hill $20 donation beer
money
beer Monaghan Q Steven thanks Steven
thank you very much appreciate it man
bazinga X $20 donation any idea of Intel
or AMD will be coming out with the CPU
it's more than 18 cores or 36 threads
this year hard to say really
there's been yeah I mean hey I would say
it's it's likely just because they're
always trying to push more cores it's
all of a sudden there's a we're core
crazed until a name to your core crazed
I'm gonna disagree with Kyle okay
probably not Ultron I think Intel is
gonna be satisfied with their 18 core we
have the fastest we have the most 18
cores and I think threader / - were
probably gonna see thread Ripper - but I
see that being more a faster 16 core
than adding more course to it or maybe
thread Ripper twos gonna include a 32
gig version at a thirty-two core version
since they've had that on epic that
would be uh that would be super sweet
but um we'll have to wait and see thank
you for singing though for your donation
MB 67 thank you lenticular for your
$13.30 nto nation hey Paul here's a leek
donation
help you out - Kyle you need to work on
your premature eruption problems it's a
constant it's a constant issue
hey man happens every week it seems the
wife doesn't mind it alright it just
explodes the latest grace
Tom's from Smith's with fifty Norwegian
Crona best start of stream Thank You
Tom's htpc pulp Tom so you're gonna be
happy with my video I have coming out in
just a few days whoo Kyle you're not
allowed to touch beer anymore except for
corked boodles boodles boom tell you
what I can do with my tart thief's at a
$5 Canadian house salty will chat be
that I have three gtx 980 s1 1072 seven
80s a 1060 a 582 five 70's and a 480 and
I mine on all of them also new AGA
accepts Bitcoin I don't know how salty
chat will be I hope they're not too
salty because it's not like you have a
crazy farm going and it doesn't seem
like you've went and like bought a bunch
of stock of a single GPU - like most
other people out of it so I hope you I
hope you are doing that on a renewable
energy source I guess is what I would
say thank you for your donation to our
beef pup Shepherd puppy been very
consistent lately thank you for your ten
dollar donation I still think it would
be called the eleven series cards I
based on the current series is called
the ten series last series was the nine
series and so on why would we jump 11
from 11 to 20 pop your there's a very
likely that you're right
the why we might jump from 11 to 20 is
because 11 to 10 to 11 is one higher but
10 to 20 is 10 higher and a higher
number means a better graphics card
that's not true hashtag marketing that's
hashtag marketing and that's my if they
did that that's why they would do that
is because it gives the impression of
like oh this big leap in performance
whatever but thank you pup for your
donation PC better $10 donation assuming
you're using your 79 80 what settings to
use in OBS for streaming
rate control bitrate CPU usage preset
I'm not using 79 80 at my house I have a
69 50 X on my streaming system which is
a 10 core
three processor and I haven't had to
look at the usage or anything because
it's a way overkill for what for what I
do with that right now in case you're
wondering we were trying to do 1920 by
1080 at 60 frames per second and I was
going for around 4 to 5 K 4 to 5,000
megabits per second and bigger loads for
saying it kilobits sorry 4 to 5,000 for
the twitch stream and I was trying to
get to 7,000 for the YouTube stream but
because the CPU has to encode both of
those at the same time it's it's like
doing two separate workloads yeah so my
6500 was tanked yeah it was it was
chop-chop it was too much right now we
have been sitting really steady at about
75 percent usage for this whole stream
so doing it doing a damn fine job just
had to lower the bitrate down to about
3000 Hertz which and we're at about
5,000 on YouTube right Dez Jones $5
donation 34 40 by 1440 is there if
there's an $80 difference should I get a
Vegas 64 over the 56 also the Sapphire
56 is 3/8 pins but 64 is just - what
choice should I make okay first of all
sapphire having more inputs doesn't
really make much of a difference so it's
not that significance of a difference in
the power draw of the specific GPU that
is why they have 3/8 pins usually they
do that to impress people or to like set
up for some crazy unlocked voltage
overclocking experience that most people
cook that most people can't access
because you have to have a hacked BIOS
and hack to be BIOS or something you
probably won't give you a ton more
performance anyway yeah so I don't worry
about that that power 56 $80 difference
yeah I mean the 56 isn't that far behind
the 64 so $80 difference are you looking
at like nine hundred and twenty versus a
thousand dollars or are you looking at
four hundred and fifty versus five
hundred and thirty yeah it's more the
percentage
the difference more so than if you're
already paying if you're already
overpaying then you might as well
overpay a little bit more for the 64 if
not then you're probably okay with an
overclocked bigot 56 okay
Greg wall rust with the $10 donation
thanks for the great videos about to
embark on building a new rise in 2400 G
system this week I wish you the best
Greg thank you for your donation and the
2400 G is a really solid choice right
now if your and not interested in
forking over way too much money for a
graphics card and it'll hold you over
for a while too so so good job there
thank you Greg gypsy dog - $5 donation
Paul I built my first computer with your
guide from Newegg TV seven years ago now
I work in IT let's awesome that's
awesome gypsy down like like for real
awesome I I'm still very proud of those
old school no Mike TB how to build a PC
videos I still have this idea in my head
I've said this once or twice on other
live streams or something but I have
this idea in my head that there's
somebody back in the day who learned how
to build a PC from one of those videos
who's going to go on to do some
wonderful thing like you know cure count
the cancer whatever and basically I'll
get to take credit and hopefully it
monetary just it's not cancer patient on
their dead bed I am thank you Paul and
just enjoy her wall right here that
somebody has been able to put together
computer and you know people use
computers for lots of things so you know
who knows who knows what benefits you'll
get out of that in the future but good
job pup Shepherd with another $5
donation taxi drivers working from home
powered by Nvidia that would be cool
drive people around from the comfort of
your own home hmm possibly more likely I
see just autonomy i autonomous driving
taking over but maybe there'll be an
interim period there Oh or possibly what
I see is more likely autonomous driving
taking over for the most part but you
have like a phone home thing that the
autonomous car can do where it's like
I'm in trouble I don't know what to do
you know phones home to some central
location where they have 20 Pluto or
whatever who can jump in and virtually
see what's going on take the
and give a human response or
decision-making person the Wendy's
totally possible yeah and also that is
true you also need a those cars will
then need to have a robotic arm so they
could actually taste a fast-food bag or
you know take the ticket from the the
parking you know parking meter kiosk and
stuff like that I'm kind of curious to
see I've seen a few things in like San
Francisco and other areas where they're
doing testings but um like the delivery
systems right once the delivery systems
have vehicles that are autonomous that
don't need a human to ever be in them
like the shrinking down of them so like
what might pull up to your house to
deliver a pizza or something like that
might be really small might just be this
tiny little thing yeah pulls up and like
pop spits out and then you know right
goes away whatever mmm I'm curious to
see in five 10 15 years what that's
gonna look like but see if it's too
small then it's gonna be really easy to
steal and some like guy who's really
into pizza is just gonna snag that thing
but then it's kind of this the the you
know the Wi-Fi and the security built
into it so like if you would steal it
they'd know exactly where it is and
they'd come and hunt you down that's why
you got to be a fast eater
you gotta book it all right thank you
thank you
Shepherd TV chair dollar donation baby
chow hey guys haven't been able to catch
you lives a quad case looks super cool
and I didn't know you had a brother
named rile Kyle it's actually my brother
my identical twin brother his name's
actually Lyle but he has an accent so it
sounds like Bryl but it's his name's
lyle confusing sometimes but yeah he's
doing well good guy Giovanni commodity
$10 donation Paul the company I work for
was Papa increment increment Li recently
no gpus at my branch sadly this is
probably a reference to my response to
Jays tweet recently which is just some
scuttlebutt that I have heard which is
that a lot of the lack of GPUs in the
market is probably less to do with
people going into retail stores or
online at places like new AG going and
buying a bunch at the same time it's
probably more likely people who are
going directly to the distributors
because there's lots of distributors
Ingram Micro cynic
Tech Data dnh just some that come to
mind they're very big they work in the
tech industry and they'll deal in lots
of you know 20 50 a hundred a thousand
at a time so you're probably looking at
big companies that are going and buying
in bulk and sucking up the inventory
that would otherwise have been more
available to be distributed to retailers
like new AG or Amazon or that kind of
thing and thereby also I also don't know
if those distributors are also jacking
up their prices at the same time I'm not
sure
hey he says can't decide on a 1080 for
the win at versus for the win to is the
for the win to worth it
no well if it's 5 or 10 bucks shirt go
for it if it's more than that not really
it's still a gtx 1080 in there it's
still got overclocked - same about the
same coolers exactly the same core is
it's slightly different the for the ones
who has the it has the icx so it's got a
PCB with a bunch of thermal oh right
thermal read points on there and
everything so yeah if you're trying to
like take again a 1080 that you can
overclock like to 2040 megahertz versus
2010 megahertz then yeah that for the
win - might be worth it for you but
honestly 1080 is a 1080 for the most
part so yeah probably out worth the
extra money
bazinga X $5 donation Kyle needs another
pie in the face for not wearing his
wedding ring what is your wedding ring
Kyle I'm allergic to my ring and I'm not
saying that as a joke
I actually am allergic I'm allergic to
many different types of metal I have a
tungsten ring and I'm allergic to it I
used to wear a nickel bracelet when I
was in elementary school it was an ID
bracelet had my address and stuff had to
had to get rid of that necklaces watches
all that shit gives me a crazy rash so
that's sometimes why when my skin starts
to like peel this is actually two or
three days healed - three days ago like
my skin was just peeling like I had like
a damaged skin ring after wearing the
wedding ring for prolonged periods a
plague or something I need to get like a
like one made out of bone or oh yeah or
like cool yeah
or like Jade Jade would work some kind
of stone maybe like silicon if I'm like
you know just whatevs I also have a
tungsten ring my requirements were that
I wanted it to be the same general
design as the Ring of Power but some
Lord of the Rings but silver yes did you
get it transcribed inside no it doesn't
put the LED that clothes that have I
haven't wait yes the the eternal love it
you the words are every elvish having is
that if Mordor
so so yeah it's it's tungsten but the I
I like it cuz the outside of it it's
like I'm scuffed beyond a mad beyond you
know it's very scuffed the outside of it
gets banged around a lot I well it looks
loved I wash dishes and everything love
a drain but the inside is pristine so
pristine clean and your finger keeps it
all smooth and clean and reflective
polishes polishes it every day anyway
it's beautiful
ok what were you talking about Epis Inka
ax thank you for your donation Derek
Parham $5 Cal needs to do his Paul
impersonation during his half of the
show oh that won't be necessary I'm sure
I haven't drink enough beer yet need to
do more beer yeah we'll do some you've
attempted that while I'm here no but if
I was offended got super pissed I
wouldn't care all right wow there's too
many more donations alright thank you
all of you and ruch wire five dollars
Canadian hey guys sick recently sick
recent builds YouTube forgot to answer
my second question last week because
beer what lens do I need for a camera
the lens that's a really that I have
used that looks really nice is not crazy
it's expensive but it's not crazy
expensive and it looks a lot nicer than
what it costs it's 650 to 800 dollars
every day yeah yeah
Sigma 18 to 35 800 art lens whether they
call it the YouTuber lens youtube they
called the eq really and the reason why
it's a good lens is also is because even
though it's I mean expensive when it
comes to lenses really relative they can
get so damn pricey yeah
800 is actually really good for this
lens in particular even if you don't
have
huge budget because it is so versatile
you can literally use it for just such a
huge range of shooting environments
whether you're trying to get something
up close or more mid-range or even far
away I think and it's available with a
few different mounts as well you can get
a Canon EF mounts the Nikon mounts
enough this is so neat fun fact that
your ones we're using right now oh yes
if you want a little demo looks good
it's gorgeous okay that's what's nice
Steve Anderson $5 donation my girlfriend
Laura says if I spend any more money on
nerd stuff she'll leave me Oh so here's
five dollars off her debit card haha
nice show her who's boss Eve
Laura ease up Laura you have to let your
man by his let you man by his toys I
don't know if Laura's watching right now
but Laura the trick is you have to get
just as into it as he is and if possible
even more so and then you'll actually
find that he like fold like wow you're a
little too into this computer
eh I should back off but turn the TV see
if I wish you the best in your future
relationship and I don't think their
future relationship is I think their
future relationship to doom now that he
just stole her credit that's true and I
need it yeah so run up to some good many
charges as you can I guess before it
falls apart there you go dude was up
with five dollar donation how long
should you use an AO before you change
it out I found my H 105 for three years
and it still works fine but when should
I consider buying a new one when it
starts performing less yeah um so my
experience with the IOT's is the pump
use usually the the thing to go at least
that's what I've experienced but hey
you've got it three years and you're
still doing okay three years honestly
it's probably the point where I would
start to kind of keep a closer eye on it
so listen close listen if that pump
starts to make a rattle or anything like
that beyond that you're probably okay
but just think attempts and yeah just
keep it monitor up or something like
that I don't see anything too terribly
wrong with running that H 105 till it
dies as long as you've got some sort of
temperature monitoring thing to make
sure that if it does die and your temps
start to climb up that you see it notice
it so you
and I shut down your computer and swap
it up for something else yeah Felix
Felix Montelongo twenty two dollars and
seventy seven cents okay interesting
donation amount hi Paul like the quad
seller vid and how did the pretty much
he'll do you turn out ah thank you thank
you Felix for that I liked the quad
Stiller video as well although I did
feel slightly bad because I completely
blanked that the temper glass pieces can
be removed they're held on by magnets
oh it's like you ever do a video we're
like you just missed some fundamental
thing right I should have got that that
was I was like oh wait so you thought
there were parts of the case that were
inaccessible know that so each each
quadrant has a tempered glass panel
right that sits on top of it you can
look inside and see the quadrant right
you have to slide the entire like this
this Kurt or this bent aluminum sleeve
like off of each side to actually get in
and work with it okay but you can also
just pop off space which gives you some
access but you still can't do everything
with removing it so I need a combination
of both really
yeah some stuff you might be able to do
with just the temper glass piece other
nicer stuff you might not say yeah but
that's that's just my personal promote
real view in arctic panther has
completely turned clear and I'm planning
to do a video where I open that up and
clear it out and everything I was
actually promote chill recently launched
a new product that's meant to be like a
loop cleansing product or something like
that like a prep product before you use
view so I was considering about maybe
hitting them up to try that out the
video that Jay uploaded about his view I
watch that reads that kind of scarred me
because that's what the coolant that I
used in the elite build and was it the
gray it was the gray and the gray is
supposed to be oh not not ideal for all
that build-up and stuff so I might have
to do a video like that too I think Jays
just sort of started this trend where
anyone who's using a system with view
fluid in it is like oh shit I gotta like
drain the shit out and like take a look
at my blocks I can already see like on
my model block that it's there's a bit
of buildup yeah so I think it's good to
have because fruit for the
EPIK water cool builds where you put it
all together and fill it up and like do
the cool shots with like the water
flowing through and it looks really
badass I think it's very very important
to also show the three months or six
months later yeah
when you've got to clear it out right
and what that experience is like as well
it is there is more maintenance involved
with a full custom liquid cooling loop
all right Rita Moochie five dollars guys
I'm rebuilding my computer while
watching your live stream can't wait for
pin my PC so I can fix on the fly love
you guys long time alright we'll be
doing that on Cal's half of the show
good luck on rebuilding your system
thank you very much zero blade five
dollars Kyle trade me your Asus Vega 64
he doesn't say what for
he just says trade me just trade me just
just for nothing
I would do that but I like it and I'm
gonna use it so I probably won't use I'm
sorry idara
Kyle when does get we get weekly pin my
PC video love from Texas good to see you
making vids again Paul or with your hand
thank you very much hi lung I from your
comment and name I wouldn't have guessed
you were from Texas but you know Penn my
PC is coming up probably within the next
20 minutes or so yeah stay tuned it's
gonna be exciting
cheater aid $5 love both channels yes I
know just built my first PC rise in 520
400 G and Paul your 5 things to do after
video is probably one of the best around
for newbies that is a really good video
and it's got what three million it's
about three million basically it's gonna
hit 3 million it's one like so freakin
insane it's one of those video like I'm
so happy with it but of course there's a
there's a mistake in it which is why I
did the follow-up video three more
things to do with you know with your PC
but that's good I mean ya know I'm it's
it's it's a it's a minor mistake and not
something that would that would affect
very many people it's when you're doing
Windows 10 installation mmm-hmm
if if you're booting off of the USB
Drive you need to boot off of the USB
Drive in UEFI mode in order to install
Windows 10 and UEFI mode right my
assumption was it doesn't matter which
mode you boot the us off the USB Drive
in because the window yes did you say it
doesn't matter
or you just I did not I didn't even say
it it's just visual you can see what I
did in the videos I was following along
exactly if they don't know what they're
doing right then they would probably do
the exact same thing in the follow-up
video explain what it does and how you
can tell which way you did the
installation right and it's not even
really a significant difference like
it's like at two five-second difference
in start-up time yeah but it's just one
of those things but anyway yeah I'm glad
that video did really well cuz it's one
of those it's one of those videos I
guess no one had really made that just
kind of right everyone so focused on the
build itself they forget what about
afterwards so yeah I'm glad that helped
yep Dez Jones $5 donation hey Kyle
singer dripper built earlier will be
using the same motherboard with the
water-cooled 1920 X and the new white
mesh fic nice yes it's the mini the
micro ATX starter / build yep pretty
sweet that's pretty cool measure the
white mesh if I see that'll look really
nice especially a water-cooled and stuff
good luck on that cool it's a great
motherboard nice they have a really nice
motherboard this is micro version of the
mesh fire right
that's the defined see mini this is IC
mini but there's a micro version of is
there a mic over there is it yeah that's
the latest case I think they launched a
couple weeks ago was the defense I'm
sorry measure if IC mini cool all right
mr. Fineman try noxus gaming $10
donation I need an in case it needs to
hold dual or trippers dual or triple CPU
radiator two single radiator for both my
gtx 980ti hybrid water-cooled any advice
and links not the 900 d you need ok dual
or triple CPU radiator and two two
single radiators for both alright so
you've got dual 1080 eyes hybrid
water-cooled try noxus i feel like
you're a case labs contestant look at
case labs
yeah their cases are expensive but you
get what you pay for their cases are
amazing and they also have very large
cases that can fit a huge amount of
hardware especially if you water cooling
I would point you that direction it
seems like the type of build that would
benefit from that type of case yeah okay
pull pull pull up good
but look at a full look at a full $20
Canadian hey guys finally caught you
live love the show Kyle this donation is
for the awesome accent video the joy it
brings us priceless especially on
repeats good and apologetically brave on
you Cheers
I happy that you donated on my half for
county yes thanks that's very kind of
you
way to go I'm always glad when I benefit
from cows were Greg walrus with another
$10 donation forgot to ask my question
Paul when you build in the define C case
you were concerned about the cooling on
the 3.5 inch drives did that turn out to
be an issue
did you need an extra fan I always like
to have active cooling on my 3.5 inch
drives but it depends how hard you hit
them I often have 3.5 inch drives that
I'm doing video editing off of which
does a lot of read and sometimes write
work off of the drives which can tend to
make them a little bit warm especially
if their stacks close together so if
you're just type of 3.5 inch drives that
you're throwing in there for like
typical storage needs we're like you
know might be writing a big file to it
here and you know watching a video off
of it there but not a huge amount of
read writes you're probably fine with no
additional cooling but if you're
