to discuss on behalf of the show we also
generally have a beverage or two and
we're going to keep that to a reasonable
amount this week since last week got a
little out of hand yep just a little I
hand it wasn't entirely our faults
though we were we were formed we are
bombarded with uh with 2d jen's labor
hoisted upon by taken hostage I would
say our stream was hijacked that you

I like the minimalistic design oh we got
a echo be your by Franco sorry about

could also support us by buying some
stuff on our stores there you we have a
few new products this is kyle store
which is awesomesauce network com /
stored he has a new flash the BIOS shirt
flash the BIOS tricked the bios flasher
shirt I like I like singing the Bible

guys are very flattered that you know
it's very nice I'm all dated your bio
shirt yet all hi quit high quality just
update your bio shirt everyone um you
want one hundred percent support and
compatibility that's true always good
advice meanwhile I have recently
launched finally the zero insertion
force shirt available in black or in in
heather gray which is sexist and
sweeping the nation so far if guys if
you can't find your size in stock you
might need to wait till next week
because we are going to tech syndicate
this week or land syndicate this week
and so we're gonna be gone for the
second half of the week and actually our
our guide John who does all of our
shirts and everything he's going to be
there too and Seattle so if you guys are
going to be there we hope to see you and
and we'll be there drinking and playing
some games and all that good stuff yeah

the right size wait till next week and I
think we're gonna have some restocks
going on once once we've all returned
from the trip we shall it's gonna be
great we shall right there will also be
Johnson shouts for anyone who happens to
purchase a piece of merchandise from
either Meyer Paul store by the end of
the show that I'm sure to pull the
trigger on something during the stream
we will give you a loud and proud
Johnson shout out by the end of its very
true and you will feel violated it
probably it will be worth it thus
awkward it's a little awkward yeah okay
don't tell anyone
let's move on to what I don't know if I
should call this my first segment or not
let's juice Eggman new segment called
mail time mail time that's right mail
time down sexist because we have
physical mail here so to physical nails
to physical males that were mailed to us
we're sitting right next this is okay
and if you want to send me stuff ship it
to paul's hardware p.o box for three to
five diamond bar California and I'm 17
I'm jealous you can just spat out like
an address that you own and make it
public yeah and not worry about anyone
sending you anthrax or something so this
I'm actually I was actually supposed to
show this last week but again
distractions and all being what they
were this is the first thing that I got
in my p.o box and this is this is what
is apparently known as a potato parcel
it's the thing so thing I do not know
who sent this so thank you generous
generous contributor my sugar daddy you
call that a contribution am but yeah
potato parcel calm and the message the
message inscribed upon the potato yeah
hey Paul heard you wanted useful things
so here's a potato enjoy we should get
potatoes are sold come to sponsor the
show we should and just have a bunch of
you guys send us in your own potato
parcels and will read them off during
the show we've already given them tons
of tons of stuff yes potato parcel
that's true haha alright next up though
next I'll eat we have something we've
been waiting on for quite some time
these are from Ray sure oh yes Ryan good
ol dry shirt and I'm not gonna show this
because it says his it address on it but
I'm good yeah and he does decals and and
all that kind of stuff decals decals
deck so we have one here this is for
Kyle this is for me a like an envelope
with my name on it he sent these over
and um wow there's a lot there's a big
old pile I haven't not looked at yours
but like I now have a sticker of my face
yeah I would be illegal in mind well
Paul's hardware logo
more network some of these are awesome
hard look even wrote special
instructions on them this is 3m
reflective peel slowly heal slowly
attention to detail right there what
sticky my stick stickiness the leather
face logo faces I got the the new
updated logo awesome glorious it looks
so professional oh I like the Johnson
ones Johnson we got Oh John Johnson yes

excellent thank you so much stick these
everywhere yeah everyone will hate me
for her tush sticking these place
tonight that they shouldn't be but I
don't care and so you and so end it's
mail time melbourne let's move on to
next segment a brand new segment
something something that you guys are
probably all waiting for can I segment
called choose the cupcake choose a
cupcake yeah this is a new one alright
so I'm excited to see how this pans out
I wonder who's wondering what the hell
does this have to do with technology
segment does seem a bit half-baked look
don't worry about it you don't worry
about okay I'm gonna say is that my wife
my lovely wife brought these cupcakes
home where'd you get them from by the
way where do you get cupcakes like this
what place sells these kinds of cupcakes
don't remember this and I didn't bring
one of the one had a sticker on it it's
a bakery that's up I wish I were sure
you'll get them to sponsor the show okay
so here's here's what we got here guys
we have two cupcakes and you know what I
should have done I should have taken
some close up pictures of them you
should have you should have so we can
get this so these are to have beautiful
two cupcakes of two different flavors
sweetim item yeah Kyle's gonna
sweet a picture of these right now ready
you guys a better better close up shot
focus they look quite delicious okay um
are you going to explain later are these
are we keeping that a secret for now no
no we the flavors of the cupcakes so
here's choosing a cupcake is a very
important thing especially when you have
multiple options available to you what I
try to do is bring two cupcakes that
both Kyle or I might enjoy so that we
could possibly have a little game where
we decide who gets what cupcake but we
don't know which cupcake either of us
wants so it becomes it becomes it's like
a convoluted it's like a game it's a
Gauss it's like Game of Thrones really
in deciding which cupcake either of us
will have one of us will die because one
of us I probably died and and just so
you guys know the flavors of the
cupcakes that we're dealing with here I
just tweeted a picture of the cupcake so
if you want to close up high definition
visual each of these cupcakes you can go
to my Twitter page forever a Kyle yeah
colleges tweeted a pic or you can look
it up right here on the stream or we can
just should look at the boom look how
amazing sciences yeah these are the
technology cupcakes tech cupcakes need
to make it oh wow whoa that's a high def
pic nice job phone killing it those are
the cupcakes alright so on the right we
have a salted caramel pretzel right on
the left is like a dark chocolate with
nuts okay okay the way the way the first
step of this entire process because this
is a bit of a process you guys think
this is gonna be a short segment about
choosing a cupcake no no I'm dragging
the out anyway so here here's
something for you guys to vote upon I'm
going to put a couple strap holes in
here we want to know first off like
which of these cupcakes would best
associate with us so how would you guys
describe Kyle we have two options sweet
and salty or dark and nutty and then we
have the same straw poll that's
available here for me so here's the
second straw poll
yeah and you guys think you guys aren't
watching this right now you're like what
the is he talking about with
cupcakes I don't care all right I don't
care shut up and you help us choose
which god damn cupcakes we're gonna eat
we ran out of content idea i I'm sorry
no I did Kyle's half has plenty of
content my half look we're choosing to
cupcake all right I am jealous you get
the cupcake segment I would prefer the
cupcake segment overall but you'll get a
cupcake Porter news or snow bunny knows
about the next segment is called eating
the cupcake we're just gonna eat the
cupcake for about six or seven minutes
let's have to show right here silence we
need to be sizable use the cupcake eat
the cupcake cupcake we're half done
we're halfway through love it right the
other thing is that nobody and nobody in
YouTube on YouTube has these links sadly
this is the most show prep we've ever
had oh yeah YouTube you know we have
like plates and little YouTube horse for
some links so you guys can get in on
this too for now but how would I want to
know how you what which how do you
identify yourself here though um have
these two options we'll see like salty
the whole salty thing that's that that's
kind of you know gained a connotation on
the internet for being like angry right
or like if you're bitter about something
you're salty a little bit well that's
that's kind of what I saw I I don't see
myself necessarily as a bitter person
I'm just gotta let things roll off of me
but you do too so I wouldn't describe us
all to either so I feel like that's the
one that's the one thing because I feel
like we you and I can both be sweet
nutty and dark all at the same time
sometimes like they all share let's
again you know we share some of those
attributes that you know the salty thing
I'm not sure um I I would have to go
dark and nutty just as a whole it suits
me better I am freaking nutty at time so
I I can't act I true and I cannot deny
behind socal's more identifying with
dark and I see I like what you're saying
what you know about salty but I feel
like all right I'm gonna play devil's
advocate here on the side of the salt
though right especially wouldn't the
association that you have with like
people don't follow salty sea plug
people feel in salty right no that's why
I'm defending it rhymed if in here don't
be salty bro but salty I mean it's like
you're bitter about stuff or like that
kind of thing but that's not really ate
it what I see salty is being it's it
you're being you're being of damn it the
word I'm looking for here you're you're
being soluble soluble in water with a
high nacl no trying to think of words as
a septum something no you're being
discerning this is the word I'm trying
to be like you know if you want to be
negative about something if you want to
be if you and I could take something
yeah that's like what we do you know we
review stuff okay you know here's what I
didn't like about this yeah in this
because it's stupid okay and you get a
little salty about it but hey you know
what that's part of life you got to take
you got to take the dark and nutty along
with the salty and sweet and sweet and
salty that's true let's and you don't
get the sweet without the salty we're
gonna move this little they come as a
package that's true well the package
both of these are undoubtedly sweet yeah
and indubitably all right you got lots
of side beat us lets us all going on and
twitch chat here Robert uh let's see
what you looking at salt what people
Kyle got dark and Eddie you house
definitely dark and Eddie bag what am i
a two percent margin according to
according to people voting on the stroke
and you know they all meant dark like
literally like no he doesn't have like
this is dark deke to him he's just
physically Brown physically his skis
browner than I am all right I'm sealer
nuts let's see what was for me here and
I go oh you're whoa what what holy crap
not even is fifty-fifty well you get one
more vote for sweet and salty no notes
milk it it's chick it's changed by the
same I'm I was we I was you were you
were so few seconds ago sweet and salty
but then i just i switched right Betsy
that shows you how important it is that
we did this segment of the show today we
would never know is because we would
never obviously this is a highly
contested you see I we should argue
about this on our side fight later as
well just the whole episode is Jesus
asked okay bed revolves around these
cupcakes um look at now it's just it's
skyrocketing now 64 dark and Eddie's
going on all right now you get rolling
because my results were already revealed
I think I think initially you had sweet
and salty as your as the top pick I
think that's what people were feeling
more of and then once we revealed my
result started it was dead it was it was
pretty dead breaking even
you're right it shows how versatile I am
that's true that's true cuz you can be
pretty dark too so you know you got some
dark humor in yeah I can so I've okay
people don't think you're very
discerning that's really all i have
planned for this segment but what I
realized that I've completely failed
though it actually helping us decide
which cupcake to choose well I thought
it was whatever the audience chose
everywhere audience joke right so sorry
you get the chocolate and I get the salt
and crime yes yeah I mean I mean even
though this was pretty much a tie for
you this was definitely in my favor
that's true so I guess that's how we can
decide for a gun with the numbers sake
of ease in it although i do want to try
a bite of that because the pretzel looks
good too mine well well screw you
against is spoken you have been salty
enough today that's true you where's
your sweet side oh where is the
sweetness the one the one that I tried
last night was it aight Tyrone I put on
which is a licensor oh it's a Filipino
dessert it's like banana wrapped in like
rice paper and the fried ooh it's really
good it's like writing plantain type of
yeah yeah and the Soviet the one they
made was an absolutely amazing okay Wow
time to time to move on this is gonna be
the most decadent thing I've ever to
hopefully provide a bit of contrast to
that the silliness that has been the
show so far let's actually skip straight
to news oh wow how is it how is this
really good yeah yeah these are really I
mean they're really good kept it's not
even like oh the topping whatever the
topping is like the cake itself is like
Oh moist yeah its just oh it's what
makes me I'll find that but hunt them
down like that I will find them myself
if I have to do let's do some news Peter
already pushed out into revolt hmm but I
started talking about the goddamn
cooking love it crank is a lie so the
first big headline news story here and
and yeah let's just let's just jump
right into it is is asrock this is pc
world article by the way this is by
Gordon none and as rock has basically
confirmed the ten core Core i7 broad
will process Broadwell e processor the
6950 X they've confirmed that it's going
to be out that it's going to have 10
cores this is all the stuff that's been
kind of rumor up till now there were
some Intel stuff that happened last week
that we've kind of discussed as well but
as rock just came out with a press
release yeah hey here's here's a press
release about it oh the press release
stated among other things here's the
actual press release on their site the
most in unmissable part of Intel
Broadwell e is the flagship core i7 6950
X which will be the first deca core
processor on on the commercial market
horror latekka core dumps fundus yeah
I'm the DECA core it is a deck or it's a
deca quarterdeck get the deca guard I
have a deca core in my system so she
can't wait to say that that's why I'm
going to spend the fifteen hundred
dollars to buy it so i can say that it's
ways it's a way better than quad-core
deca core have you tried my cupcakes
that's ten that's ten cores but it
actually has double number right be cool
if you could put 10 of them together a
decade dekha korte mm-hmm what's what's
the thing for twenty eventi eventi core
yeah like a comes after the grande
that's that's wrong I'm getting your
unravel it my only basis from knowledge
for that reference okay BAM um well
that's fun 10 cores kind of fun tim
kouris Broadway Brad well II these
should go in x99 motherboards so
existing XNA and motherboard should
support them as long as your motherboard
manufacturer provides a bios update yeah
you will need to update your bios first
before you drop the processor in unless
you have a fancy motherboard that can do
something like USB bios flashback like
asus boards and gigabyte has a version
of that too i haven't at this ms i have
one of those ya know gigabyte did it ms
i think Emma side does yeah yeah and I
think they all do all the major players
is cool apart from it actually being
like pretty much verifiably confirmed
right now though there's a little bit
more information
that has come out regarding this and
that is these guys right here three
other skews an i7 6900 k at I 768 50k
and an i7 6800 k these are no their bra
freshers they're just turned abroad well
II owe the brunt will eat yeah okay I
thought these really know the whole
county whatever no no I did oh no
they're all 6000 series okay but yeah
they're all the 6800 series and the 6900
series are enthusiasts rod well II yeah
so there's no specific details on those
CPUs quite yet presumptively or the
assumption right now is that the 6900 k
is going to be an eight-core and then
the 6850 k and 6800 k are going to be
six cores who knows what they're going
to do about pcie lanes or nothing to
differentiate Stan like that Intel had
that leak that happened last week though
already that we talked about that stated
that the 69 50 x would be running at
three point five gigahertz out of the
box which is pretty pretty nice for a 10
core processor often the you know the
even the x-series ones when they have
lots of cores you know they can run at
lower clock speed 59 60 x was three
point oh I think base yeah I forget I
figured surest maybe I might have been
3.2 turbo or three point I forget yeah
anyway um Jordan coward thank you so
much for your donation sir I'm glad that
somebody found the cupcake thing I hope
it was vaguely amusing um anyway the
young one fan there's speculation in the
article that these leaks might be like
sort of intentional on Intel's part due
to like sales of desktop parts not being
quite as like spectaculars that could be
and then I'm going to Windows 10 all
that kind of stuff yeah so who knows I'm
never really sure if until I kind of
Intel's usually pretty conservative
about stuff like that they're usually
pretty strict about their launches and
that kind of thing right and who's to
know if they ever like actually condone
like a leak or something like that you
know usually that type of thing would
happen behind ya pan closed doors or a
phone call or something who knows I
don't know or it could just be as rock
being the scrappy underdog in the
motherboard market wanting to gain more
attention for themselves and also having
less regard for Intel's NDA's I don't
know yeah could be either one that's
exciting though it is this kind of be
saying that means we have to up we both
have to update our test beds now the
Canada's yeah i'm yeah I don't know what
I'm gonna do I might I mean get update
the main system maybe I don't know we'll
see you're a Arctic Panther
possibly be swapping yeah do loss
current-gen baby I don't know I feel
like I'm gonna swap in like a fifth 6950
X and maybe some Pascal cards some gp100
s probably gonna do a whole build like a
whole fresh build from the ground up I
think yeah I mean I don't know what I'm
gonna do a hotline then ha lines gonna
be old news by then i'll probably just
like leave it in a dumpster somewhere
piece anyways your just
because it's it's it's time is over
let's check it i mean it's no one would
i get not even bother reselling the
parts no apply them no one's gonna care
if i even bother anyway okay let's uh
let's move on the next story all right
when we wanted the next story isn't
really a story next oh god why is it
doing this I will stare my laptop if I
want to her me excuse you to their
huh sears is what we're going to do next
what this is some news but it's news
that Kyle and I aren't really that
familiar with so we're gonna do is we're
gonna do a reactive video yay react
videos Cal and I are gonna react now
Amanda now that we won't get sued by the
fine Bros yeah yeah for sure we're gonna
react to a couple game trailers have
just come out for games that yes are
going to be available on PC okay as well
as consul yep so we got titanfall 2 as
well as Gears of War for okay two big
lunches too big launches two big
trailers that just drop neither of them
are terribly
so the only thing that I might have a
hard time with here is I'm gonna play it
here and I play it for you guys so we
don't have audio over here but we have
audio here anyway we'll figure it out
and yeah the audio might be a little out
of sync for you guys but that's okay
because we don't want to we don't want
to share the audio from the south oh god
I forgot that still going one of the
trailers is only music and there's no
actual dialogue so the sink won't even
be very notice yeah that's sure um I
think that's for the gears of war one
okay so I feel I feel like so like I
have to perform because you know for a
reaction my first reaction of you ever
we're gonna be real tiny in the little
in the corner that's true pleasure to
see her that means no means my my
reactions to be even bigger than
actually like hmm I should have done a
new exploit layout for okay this I'm
just getting my reaction fast we're
gonna start with tight tight ball to do
it over here and make this tf2 no not to
be mistaken for team thing I do yes I
mode but all right let's uh let's hit
play simultaneously oh wait after this
ad this adds gotta play why am I not
signed in with like okay ready yep Evans
ready do it
the problem is you have to be willing to
die for what you believe it was the ad
dad try so hard
you'll live longer
he's got a sword oh that's new that's a
new thing great they didn't have swords
before you're right now they're like
Gundams that was it that was a whole
song oh I didn't even realize the title
says it has swords in it that was the
best trailer I've ever seen that was so
compelling I've never seen anything more
exciting what a reveal it is a teaser
trailer it's a teaser trailer they put
the word teaser and they were so it's
okay who's that so so yeah so titanfall
with swords are you interested now uh
you know if I wasn't on board before I
certainly am now I mean if that was the
one thing I was like you know title
great game but no swords ya hear it I
was like well I'm out then I guess I
can't participate in this I can't be a
part of whatever this is cuz we need
some more nuanced tunic to the melee
donna combat and everything you know yep
shen ji alright well wasn't that a
fabulous reaction we just yeah we did we
okay I don't why do you guys saw it I
don't know what else to say about it
like they got a sword and dude sounded
that he was also kinda like just telling
you to chill he was like hey you know
don't try so hard have a limited night
as wasn't that kind of the message have
a lemonade I you said to chill I was
sure you take away you gotta gonna freak
out take it easy that's two teaser Thank
You game it's just a game I'm kind of is
alright um epic reaction epic reactions
here let's move on to two gears of war
okay here's award for oh god I feel like
that wasn't even qualified to be a
teaser yeah is really short that's
that's what I'm expected to see when I
had one like for watching a you know
Star Wars teaser or something like I was
worse than the doom teaser like a two
second clip of like a skeleton like that
good death metal single sprite-based ash
as well be a JPEG oh it might have been
a buster sword ah alright let's move to
Gears of War Gears of War I believe this
one's yeah this is a minute one all
right this one's a admit it long as well
I'm expecting intensity it's called
tomorrow
all right wait I don't eat a chip while
this is loading oh wait wait wait no sir
no trying to synchronize this already
has 2.2 million views wow ok ok digging
for digging fire thinking if somebody
running horse it's Marcus oh it's that
cover he's so strong he's got a family
he's killing murder murder wife
beautiful lovely child murder murder
kill or destroy destroy you
you fire oh ki of cute running I'll
helping daddy let the tree you
 monster run carving our
names hello I'm just live narrating
everything this this is something this
is kind of a theme of gears trailers
right yeah it's such that there's so
much contrast going the juxtaposition
between it's the peace and the war a
nightmare the nightmare will I weren't
ok and that was the sound of silence
redone by disturbed I believe yeah the
disturbed command I was telling Paul
earlier like I feel like they should
have just gone with the original song I
was I feel like that would be even more
of a like you know a contrast between
what's going on on-screen able to like
that much better and the originals just
there's nothing wrong with the original
don't don't don't fix it if it's not
broken and also because because I knew
it was disturbed like every any waking
second watching that trailer here's like
the sound of sand I'm just waiting for
that's all I was waiting for so it kind
of threw me out the whole the whole
thing let's see what you mean that yeah
that's not my favorite cover if I'm
being honest it's also a song I really
like so it's time for me to appreciate
it I mean you got it it's such a good
song it is so um but ya know I really
like I mean you could see them going for
the same vibe that went with the
original gears of war trailer with mad
world yeah that was a really cool tree
that was the best that one of the best
trailers game trailers I've ever
seen this unless impress truth yeah
anyway ok let's continue let's discuss
and classic let's discuss something
fairly interesting here maybe that was
corn nuts corn not disturb does it corn
they're the same thing the guy from corn
now what r 100 people are Nick you're
not the same I I with Kyle on that one
earlier I was like wait who's like for
covered by that dude he's I guess
disturbed I have to look I'm totally and
copy out hey no no no it was covered by
disturbed but the whole oh that's all
right I see what right see you see you
shouldn't try to confuse me no one no
one would even know the difference Paul
didn't know it's because they're the
same they are not bands that I follow
closely let's put it that way same here
you're not my dad tell ah alright let's
back to what the hell is about to talk
about here I gtc which is a g-force
technology conferences going on this
week and this was something quite
interesting from it right when it was
went last week after this is this is an
interesting thing that kind of came out
of it a little bit more niche little bit
more different this is posted I'm road
to VR I'm gonna play this video and it's
not gonna make a whole lot of sense to
you guys so what's going on right now
what they're showing here in the video
is almost like it there it's like a
machine that is moving a display so the
machine is moving the display very
rapidly you can see the movement of the
display by the parts out on top on the
bottom this what seems to be a static
image represented here in the middle
that a video logo is actually moving
across the display as the display moves
so as to fool you into thinking that it
is a static image I won't that make
sense no no I thought I just explained
that very well how how is it so still
though even though it's moving the
display the display is moving but the
display is also all right consider stuff
like with with with head tracking right
because this is this is a partial this
is very associated with more like the
logos moving with the movement so you
have a display that's a big company
logo is right here and as well as the
display moves that way the logo moves
across to display that so it perceptibly
it's always yes so from the cameras
perspective the logo does not know
castrate at the center yeah right the
reason you just uh can explain yeah no I
don't shut up the reason it's it's
fascinating the reason they've been
doing this is because they're trying to
show how imperceptible imperceptible the
actual movement is as as this is being
shaken and moved around and that can
it's definitely imperceptible on this
guy's shaky camera phone yeah that's for
sure what's also like you know taken
from the crowd video taken from the
crowd at a conference of a projector you
know so bear that in mind too I know all
right what is this what the hell are you
in look at this is a 1700 hurts refresh
rate display 1700 hurts so you got your
hundred and forty years man got your
hundred and forty-four hurts fanboys out
there right who are like man I can't
play can't play an FPS any Mona sits on
at least hundred forty-four hurts like
you know I can't it came and do 69-62
too though right anything under 100 you
know you get that elitist mentality
whatever no point what's the point but I
i apprec appreciate it i can appreciate
the high refresh rate affinity it's
definitely very helpful for smooth
movement not sort of thank you master
but the trend i work with here is ways
to reduce latency when it comes to to
gaming and when it comes to VR in
particular i can see it making much more
of an impact in VR VR is like motion
sickness and things like that and what
that you eyes to work with yeah yeah and
they've explained it I'm sorry they've
they've been working with this in order
to help vr headsets do much better and
smoother head tracking so that the image
displayed on the screen is tracking
smoothly with your head to give you a
better immersion and to reduce motion
sickness and particularly to reduce
latency so they're running this display
at 17 hundred Hertz refresh rate and
they also have it attached to some sort
of motion sensors that it can sense the
motion of the display as it's moving
around and this is just demo that
they're setting up with a fixed display
but the idea here is that this could
port over to being used with with VR or
something
like that go about the term that they're
using here that is is often used in VR
as motion to photons latency which is
basically referring to the three points
of lag on three primary points of lag or
latency between when it comes to VR
headset that is the detection of the
motion of your head wait detection of
the input itself which is the input from
the motion of your head the rendering of
the image done by the game engine to the
time it takes to actually illuminate a
pixel in a display to represent whatever
has been whatever is changing right
right now they're working with 20
milliseconds of latency which is is like
passable for VR and that's what is going
to exist on the VR headsets that are
coming right now yeah but they are
saying based on their research they've
done that things get much better towards
10 milliseconds of latency so you know
yeah but in milliseconds is better 20
but there's even measurable benefits
down tussles 1 1 millisecond so I guess
the point here is that soon enough for
Gabe you have people just desk not at 17
hundred megahertz display refresh
radiologist and we shouldn't chill
outside and cool imagine having to like
g-sync that refresh rate on a regular
monitor yeah it's obvious it's a very
simple image that they're displaying w
200 FPS Oh kind of GPU configuration
that would require need 1700 frames per
second I keep dipping below the
refresher I don't know what's going on
into like it's only 1700 verts 4k
resolution displays shrunk down to the
size of like you know the tune I don't
like two inch monitor on our camera
there keep that in front of you for any
of your face at all times alright let's
move on so uh next up is sword fight
some wood boy a certified little river
uh wait sorry it's not there okay we're
good search but you know or not my
problem I switched over all comfortably
and then there's circuit okay can have
sword fights swing your sword with
confidence pot the sword fight lower
thirds take your soy by the balls okay
so certified is where can I take
opposing sides on a
contentious topic and we argue them and
we also let you guys argue amongst
yourselves or vote in a straw poll and
then we decide who wins at the end mu
you can vote right off the bat or you
can wait for us and stay tuned arguments
state our arguments since we already
talked a little bit about broad well II
today I made a question based on that
how are you gonna ask this question and
because it's sword fight we got to
decide this and I get asked us all the
time this is a question that's asked to
meet constantly and I constantly tell
people that I can Tran sir it so that's
why we're gonna answer it right now then
for broad well II we have to to new cpu
launches coming to see you're both
highly anticipated both supposed to be
very high end we've just heard about
broad well II being most likely uh what
brought what's bread will you wait
that's the wrong trouble ye broad well
he's gonna have a 69 50x it's 10 cores
yeah I mean paste that into chat real
quick what's the most corazon is gonna
have eight no Zen is gonna have to 232
core 22 32 cores is what they've talked
about so far so yeah but Zen is also
maybe further off right now we're not
getting as many leaks as many updates
about yeah then and what's what's going
on was then so we're gonna based on
vague speculation rumors and
inconsistent information we are going to
decide this right now what you guys
should invest your money in and surely
these arguments will stand up to the
test of time once these products
actually launch prepare for both of us
to eat or well you know is this really
is gonna give me its is going to give me
the option to when people say and next
week like should I get Zen or should i
wait for Zen i'll be like go watch
argument yeah we discussed it all it
will be decided to give you a very
decisive and okay okay yeah we need the
voting link here guess alright one sec
i'll paste it in youtube happier than
cloquet
you know you use slow I already did
twitch well I'm on top of every day me
Oh Daniel you're just sitting there
doing nothing well yeah I'm feeling
pretty alright Shoni to my candy i'm
looking forward to when it's your half
of the show and i mean i can i can just
 around hey it's exciting I hate you
all right so uh which side he gets a cow
bra will ya um a lot I'm gonna go the
underdog today I'm gonna go as n oh okay
I didn't know then was the underdog they
totally AMD's totaling the underdog here
ok because AMD has they have to prove
themselves they've been out of the CPU
game at least in the enthusiast market
for so long that everyone's looking to
them waiting to see if they're going to
succeed or flop whereas still make CPUs
they still make CPUs but I'm just saying
the enthusiast market for the enthusiast
market they haven't really made much
whereas like Intel's been pumping it out
you know pretty consistently Greta they
haven't been as consistent as they have
in the past because there's no
competition on the AMD side for when it
comes to enthusiasts great CPUs and I
don't think anyone has their doubts
about the type of performance we can
expect to see from Broadway League I
think a lot of people are more
interested in seeing how Zen does simply
because it has been so long since they
came out with a launch like this and you
know I think I'm feeling pretty
optimistic about it I don't know if it's
going to like outperform broad well II
you know like if both of their flagship
chips go head-to-head I don't know it
could be it could be a wash but um you
know I don't know I don't know what kind
of damage Jim Keller did and over there
at AMD before he left you know because
he was the one wrapping up all of the
the last bits there on the Zen market
design architecture and I'm really
prepping that for the company before he
just bowed out and that makes me nervous
because it's like did he bow out because
he was like I know that I can't like top
this and this is the best work I've ever
done like quit while I'm ahead or did he
bow out and skip town because he was
like this is gonna crash and burn
and tank and like this is going to ruin
my reputation if I don't get up now I
don't know but speculating us to the
ladder certainly hurts your argument it
does but i'm i'm being fair alright and
that and people people value a fair a
fair and fairness okay yes and so um you
know I I think AMD gets it has gotten a
really bad rap over the years just for
not pumping out content not content um
products looking at this from totally a
youtubers perspective certainly um but I
am very optimistic and I really do hope
that Zen knocks it out of the park
because it's going to mean good things
for the community and for the customer
base as a whole if we can have some more
competition against the almighty Intel
and kind of like nip at their heels a
bit because they've been they've been
sitting back on there sipping on their
pina coladas for a while now and I think
that they need a bit of a wake-up call
so hopefully Zen can give that to them
okay let explain why you're wrong shut
up all right intel bathroom is huge
they're like way bigger than AMD and
they have a lot more money and where as
you might say I will AMD's underdog
that's kind of what you led with like
they're the underdog I'm gonna root for
a morder it's not going to happen mainly
because intel has been fooled before you
back go back to FX 51 stealing your
cookie oh yeah they you should try that
series against about FX 51 f x 60 f x 62
back in the lorry days of the FX series
with AMD they smacked intel around until
had no response say nothing to come back
with that's when they first started out
tick-tock and and all that stuff that's
led us to where we are today and you
know what they wouldn't have done what
they did just recently and sort of end
the whole tick-tock cycle they weren't
very confident that they had a strong
lead that AMD had nothing to come back
with and that's my argument if i were
arguing on your side though i would have
pointed out 32 cores plus amd's new
version of hyper threading equals 64
logical threads which is true pretty but
that doesn't that doesn't necessarily
mean
that's not that it's a small piece to
the puzzle about these core count and
thread count is is very a small part of
the whole picture right that's because I
would have said that then you would have
said what I just said and you woulda
counter that argument we're gonna say
we're both wrong people want kb lake
it's like as you but bitches in there
that's true if you didn't put pitches
people wouldn't cares but Zen came in
second so is your all Bolger I guess you
win this one yay at interesting moving
on to our next arguments so VR has some
issues going on right now we're going to
be discussing a little bit of this over
on Kyle's half of the show but oculus
oculus rift I I got an email within the
past 24 hours indicating that my launch
date for the oculus rift is
significantly later than I was the
original exact thing and yours uh it's
the end of may beginning of June okay
mine's like the beginning of June okay
yeah so yeah that that's very
disappointing a lot of people's been
upset about them a lot of people have
been disappointed about the amount of
communication that's come from from
oculus yeah and it's a little
frustrating there's even I've been you
know some troubles over on on the HTC
vive side although a lot of people right
now are touting the vibe and there's no
apparent existing delays and shipments
for the vibe as of yet however again on
Cal's have the show he will talk about
vive pre-orders being cancelled due to
payments not going through so not all is
shiny and sunny over on that side of it
either so here's the question right now
you got early adopters who have
pre-ordered these devices and some who
are getting little upset that you know
my new toy hasn't arrived yet that's the
glutes be honest that's why I'm at my
new toys not here and I told my new toy
would be here so I was I was expecting
to be knee-deep in VR porn by now
exactly what the all this VR born
is out there not being watched my setup
subscriptions going to waste every
minute but here's the question here's
the question it's still the first half
of the year it's still April
no and honestly when it comes to retail
sales a lot of retailers you know they
care they kind of care but they don't
really care till q4 till the end of the
year till holiday season until black
friday you know when everyone actually
spends money on stuff so do you think
the companies are worried right now or
another way of putting it the way I did
here is do you think the consumers will
remember these launch issues that are
happening I put VR launch walls this is
mainly directed at the rift right now
because that's who I'm mostly pissed off
at but do you think the I do you think
the public is going to remember this do
you think this will affect them is this
going to is going to hurt their sales
when the holidays come around I'm gonna
say well should I will people remember
will you pick first last time so I guess
you could pick first again how it works
now reversed all the times all right
I'll go first this time and i will say
i'm gonna say yes i'm going to say we
will we will never forgive them we will
never forget this salty bro it is be
right back cuz i guess all you I'm salty
today look what do you here's the
problem I have no problem with delays I
have no problem with hardware shortages
you know it happens those types of
issues happen but I think what you had
going on here with some decisions to not
make communications as transparent as
they could have been based primarily on
the fact that oculus rift was going up
against a very close launch to a
competitor which is the their only
competitor in and and they're both like
the early adopters you know they're both
trying to get there first so I feel like
oculus over on their side made a
business decision at some point to be
like hey we got all these pre-orders I
don't know I don't know if these are all
going to go through i don't know if
we're going to have enough units for
this or whatever you know to fulfill
these within time we we've mentioned it
and they knew about it you know these
types of things don't just like pop like
holy we don't you know we only
ordered 200 thousands of these and we
need three hundred thousand yeah just
like they know about these types of
things they made the decision not to
communicate it to people
and they did that consciously and that
sucks because they did that because
they're going up against the launch of a
competitor pre-orders going out for the
HTC vive at the same time and like well
if we tell people that were going to be
delayed and that they're not going to
get their in time people are going
to pre-order with us now you're having
the opposite the you know the backlash
of that of people cancer canceling their
pre-orders because they felt they were
misled which you know I kind of feel the
same way too if I was a standard
consumer and I didn't make videos about
technology I probably would have
canceled my order by now yeah i can say
that pretty confidently i bet i screw
this i'm going to go off the vibe so
yeah I don't remember this and I'm gonna
hold against them in the future I'm
gonna bring it up I will I will make
sure this is remembered i will use all
of them by my fairly limited influence
on the internet to make sure people
don't don't forget this and here's why
your reasoning and your argument will be
forgotten um it simply is because if you
think about the internet and a lot like
like how many times like your isp is
 on you like I can't tell you I
can't count on two hands how many times
I've been so fed up with time warner
cable where I'm just like f this i'm out
of here screw you guys and holy crap who
else where am I gonna get my internet
from that's a monopoly oh crap it is it
is a monopoly but what I'm saying right
now this is kind of a might be a little
bit not necessarily that but at the
moment your two main options if you're
gaming on a high end pc which most of us
are is going to be the rift or the vibe
so it's not a monopoly it's not but you
don't have that many options as this
technology is still super super early
and in its infancy so yes they're gonna
screw up and yes they're going to piss
you off and and not be able to deliver
promises that they initially made
because how could they they are a single
company whether or not they're backed by
a bigger company like Facebook or
they're just a big company in general
with a lot of resources like HTC this is
changing the world in a sense and for
them to be able to keep all their
promises is unrealistic however
disappointing it may be
um so I think in the grand scheme of
things we have to just jump into it you
either jump into this crazy dance that's
going in or you get out and VR is just
not for you and you can't take it I'll
wait for next year I'll wait for next
year's Christmas when when VR is just
mainstream and everyone has one but if
you want to be on the bleeding edge of
this technology you got to wait it out
and you gotta put up with it and by the
holidays people are gonna want it
they're gonna want to open it it's the
new n64 is like your kid opening up that
rift headset or that vibe headset and
just his mind being blown and parents
are gonna give a about the
pre-order they're gonna be like my
kid won't shut the hell up about BR just
give them the sketch bloom I don't care
promised you wouldn't yell okay i am now
gets very upset about this i'm very
passionate that's right being a
corporate apologists it tends to piss
you off all right let's see what let's
see what you guys think about this one
all right see the results what do we got
we will never never oh you're all
traitors we will never forget you're all
salty screw yo something pinche oculus
and your facebook / ends anyway I'll do
a review on it as soon as it arrives ah
ok that look at those Cup look at those
cook picture those cupcakes oh that's
right there ah it used to look so pretty
it did a dragon or blue yeah I have one
last segments and that is a I'm really
I'm really out of order this this week
it's all right it's right Logan I think
we've made good time yeah anyway we're
gonna do a little Q&amp;amp;A session here to
kind of round out my half of the show
sure and that means if you guys have
questions you should ask them so we're
gonna look at chat right now chat now
we're going to answer questions that are
asked in a timely and appropriate
fashion looking for questions they must
contain all answer some shitty questions
well they have to contain substance some
amount of profanity I feel like yeah i
mean at tasteful a tasteful what colors
you
paint what would be the best cpu and GPU
for an eight hundred dollar budget 800
bucks i was you i would say x i would
spend our 380 x i'd spend a hundred
fifty to two hundred on the on the cpu
and about 300 on the graphics card i
would say forty percent of your budget
should go towards the video card and
maybe twenty-five percent should go to
the cpu and then figure out the rest
yeah yeah and you notice we don't tell
you get this GPU because those prices
always change yeah and you should figure
out how much money you're gonna spend on
that part so that's why I usually you
know ki kind of get arranged for the CPU
choose the CPU right then kind of figure
out how much it I got I got for the GPU
after that room um yeah should i
overclock my i5 6600 k yes you should
Zach yes you should I spent a lot of
today overclocking my wife's 6600 k
unless you have a potato handler end
Owen let's get a potato cool that would
suck but you can you should be able to
hit for 45 to 46 like fairly easily on a
6600 I was really pushing for 47 today
and I was having some stability issues
that were very untimely I might still be
able to tweak some stuff but um at what
I'm probably just going to do is run it
for six for the pre water-cooled numbers
yeah and then put on although cuz I just
I was tweaking and stuff and I was like
I don't want to spend all this time
doing this when I'm just going to be
removing the cooler and everything and
installing a liquid cooling loop right
and then you know I want to I want to do
the same thing again at that so yeah
true and anyway what did why didn't you
wait for Pascale for your wife spilled
why do you do like a water-cooled Pascal
system is when Pascal comes out i will
do a build for myself water cool maybe
I am going strong with the water guy why
not it's fun Paul's two cents over here
it's fun stuff I like it it's good it's
good time hey I'll probably do somewhat
the same thing when it comes yeah I mean
yes that's that's why we're in this game
is to build computers what else yeah
doesn't matter for make sense or not
Paul would you say use an old pc ivory
dancing but would you use an old pc for
an ass or buy used server boards for ECC
ram and ped thank you for the question
this is on Twitch by the way and I so I
have been advised by my friends at tech
syndicate mainly Wendell who knows much
much more than anyone i think in the
world about these things now there's
probably there's probably people that
are has like two people there's people
there in his level but not many and i
was advised yes you want ECC for a
freenas in particular but if you're
doing a home set up that you can live
without it it's it's more of a concern
to have enough memory you notice to have
the ec straight standard yeah so if
you've already got an old computer and
it's kind of good to go then you know
sure go ahead and and and and build with
it if you have the option or if you're
investing in new parts and stuff then
I'd say yes consider getting a xeon or
server chip and a server board or a you
know a mainstream board that support
server chips and go for you go for the
ECC right yeah uh Brandon is my cpu too
shitty I've got an FX 6300 black edition
and an msi r9 390 well I only get about
30 FPS in GTA 5 on normal graphic
settings yes that is all your CPU yeah
that's all your cpu's fault and none of
your GPUs fault the r9 390 is a kick-ass
card I did a recent video on one on the
Sapphire Nitro and it kicks ass you just
need a decent CP to match with it 6300
is for its not well-matched at all with
the 09 3 90 is it overclocked um even if
it's over clocks I mean if it's if it's
not you could overclock it and I'd
probably it would help a little bit yeah
but at the
the day it's not a girl it's not a
fantastic overclocking chip and at the
end of the day the game if you're
playing GTA 5 or games like it that's
super CPU intensive and that actually
does make a hell of a difference even
going from like sky lake to haswell-e in
that game which many people might not
think is a huge difference in game
performance but you'll see like a good
five seven frames on average in a game
like GTA 5 anyway where it takes a you
know advantage of those cores and stuff
so yeah it's probably time to upgrade
your whole you know motherboard you know
chipset and socket type and cpu and
things like that but you have a solid
root graphics cards and that's one of
the most expensive part so you're good
on that so yes there you go um what else
we got I I don't know I thought I had a
question then it went away things scroll
too fast sometimes I agree um I almost
didn't Big Big Boss Big Boss Man 0816
thank you for the donation he says he
says hello world hi hello world so nice
he said it twice say the world says
hello right back at you twice big boss
man hello hello hello it just just like
just like what's-his-face from you too I
mean you too yeah concert seconds is
slightly before my generation know that
song isn't really yeah I don't know know
where I would have heard that song
though
you've heard it radio it's you too they
put it on like devices then you get like
without your consent and stuff like that
this your auto read ring down III 1231 v
three vs 6600 k for gaming good question
is on you I would go with this is on
twitch I would go with the 6600 k
because you'll have better per thread
performance if your don't doing
something that's purely multi-threaded
than your III whatever 13 12 31 well
that's the one that's like a 4770 I
report 40 yeah 40 770 it's got 8 4 cores
eight threads so yeah you will get more
performance there but yeah I got the
6600 if you're going strictly gaming it
should have better direct gaming
performance and right it's newer uh to
just really quick whoever's asking if
they can submit a pc to booted if they
have one mustard cable in their system
that's fine go for it I might I probably
won't knock you for one mustard cable
but is it Dijon mustard but you're on
thin ice you're on thin ice sir or like
spicy brown mustard is that would be a
benefit yeah dejohn mustard I am more
