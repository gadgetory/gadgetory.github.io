bit the RC 100 MV mes SD and XS 700
portable SSD are both powered by
toshiba's advanced 3d BICS flash memory
meaning you get solid-state speeds at an
affordable price the XS 700 is a wicked
fast external drive with USB 3.1 gen2
via a type-c connector and the RC 100
may be small but it's MDOT to nvme
interface means sequential read and
write speeds at well over 1,000
megabytes per second click the sponsor

okay sorry about that guys but in
keeping with my video from last month
where I built the fastest gaming
computer that you can build with the
caveats being you're building a single
GPU gaming system and you're mostly
focused on gaming not much else I
promised that I would follow that up
with a faster gaming computer and now we
can do that fastest gaming graphics card
at the time when I built the system
originally was the r-tx 2080 TI which
had just launched that is still the case
we are still using a single r-tx 2080 TI
but now we have an aftermarket version
in our asus rog Strix r-tx 2080 TI so
get the fastest r-tx 2080 TI you can
overclock it as much as you can and then
combine it with the fastest gaming cpu
and although the I $9.99 hundred K which
has eight cores and sixteen threads is
not currently available and I should
point out a huge caveat here that I'm
not encouraging anyone preorder this
until they can see the reviews which
should be coming out in just a few days
where we talked about performance and
price to performance and the ridiculous
overpriced cost right now because
they're charging 580 bucks for this if
you preorder it Newegg ignoring all that
and just assuming guess you want the
best the best the 9900 K we can safely
assume is going to be that so I'm
basically today going to be taking the
system that I built last month swapping
out a few parts swapping in the faster
parts and then I will follow this video
up later on since this is a build of the
month with some additional testing that
will be separate from my introductory
launch day testing of this which way
which I am working on separately last
thing I guess I should mention before
get started as the price and this system
when we built it about a month ago
it's about 2400 ish dollars and that's
including a $1,200 RTX 2080 ti which was
half of the price this system I'm doing
today is closer to 3000 about 2900 to
3000 depending on when you buy the parts
and some fluctuations and stuff and I
did want to point out where most of that
money is coming from the CPU is 200
bucks more right now again if you
pre-order it's 580 bucks so that's the
price I'm going with for now as compared
to about 380 for the 8700 K the
motherboard I'm using is the z3 90 tight
sheet ultimate from asrock which is
their highest NZ 390 motherboard this is
a pretty nice board but you can get by
with something cheaper for example the
board I used last month was more in the
180 dollar range CPU cooler I'm using is
the cooler master master liquid ML 360
our RGB 360 millimeter radiator with
addressable RGB LEDs and everything but
it is also about a hundred bucks more
than the 240 millimeter radiator that I
recommended for last month's build and
then finally the graphics card is also
about 100 bucks more last month I used
the price of 1150 this month I'm using
the price of 1250 because again you
can't find these anywhere and that's the
rough price I'm assuming these Strix
cards are actually going to be selling
for once they are more readily available
so that's what's making the $500 price
difference going from about $2,400 to
$2,900 whether all that money is worth
it is going to be up to you the viewer
at home my job is just to build this
system so let's get started
normally when I do a build I kind of go
over all the parts and since I already
built this system I just really quickly
want to point out what's different other
than of course the all-in-one cooler
we got the motherboard processor memory
and graphics card so motherboard is the
asrock z 390 Taichi Ultimates this is
the highest end a Z 390 board that as
rock is coming out with at least at
launch right here and as you can see
it's pretty much got a dark grey color
scheme going on with some black accents
here and there it's got a little bit of
a steampunk vibe going on with the gear
design on there chipset heatsink you
might notice a couple ultra m dot two
slots right there below the CPU so those
are in decent locations there's another
one down here at the bottom that does
have a heat spreader on it too this is
probably going to be your ideal location
to start with and if you have more
amused you can add them there of course
your 9900 case it only has 16 dedicated
PCIe lanes go into all of your PCI
Express kind of activity down here as
well as your MDOT two slots so depending
on your configuration these are going to
be splits different ways at different
times that said a few other features on
the board that I do appreciate debug led
down there so helping you out with some
post code readouts as you're getting
started up surface mounted reset and
power buttons are always nice to have
especially if you're doing an
outside-the-box build if RGB support in
the form of three pin 5 volt header as
well as 4 pin 12 volt headers for the
newer addressable style as well as the
older non addressable style our power
delivery up here is supported by an 8
pin and a 4 pin a supplemental CPU power
connector and it does look like we have
some pretty beefy heatsinks on there
since I am just doing a build here I'm
not going to speak to the performance of
this power delivery setup but it does
seem like asrock has put a decent amount
of effort into that here's a look at the
rear i/o including some antenna
connection points since we do have built
an 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi there is an
external clear CMOS button there as well
which I also appreciate we also have
plenty of USB connectivity there's two
USB 3.0 headers there as well as the
newer you
to be 3.1 gen2 header beneath them and
that it looks like we have at least
seven fan connectors on the board one
two three up here at the top four down
here on the bottom right five over here
along the bottom edge six up here next
to the DIMM slots and then oh eight
total I guess seven eight over here on
the left side if I have an initial
complaint about this motherboard it's
the i/o shield I do wish that asrock
would upgrade these at least for their
highest end ones this is still kind of
the older single piece style but hey
it's still functional enough and then
it's for accessories there's not a whole
lot speak up in here they do include a
rigid high bandwidth sli bridge for 10
series GPUs and then they do have an
external antenna you can add in there as
well beyond that I've got my CPU of
course here too in case you guys wanted
a quick closer look at it it is an
engineering sample and it is in this
package that has Paul's Hardware written
on it which makes me feel special thanks
Intel for making this little package
just for me also I'm gonna swap in this
memory kits the Trident II RGB just
because the kit I recommended in the
build video was an RGB kit so this will
have it look the same this is a 3200
speed kit not a 3600 speed kit but I'll
see if I can maybe overclock it or
something like that then of course
lastly our graphics card the newly
redesigned Asus r-tx 20 atti ROG Strix
version and I already did a video where
I tried this out with overclocking so if
you're interested I will link that in
the description so check it out
alright let's move on with the building
process
alright guys this system has been
reassembled only required partial
disassembly and I think the only piece
in here that I haven't actually shown
you unless you watch the original video
last month is the power supply which is
an EVGA 750 watt g3 which I am using the
custom sleeve cable kit for EVGA s so
that is sold separately just please bear
that in mind these pretty black cables
other than that I wanted to point out
that our fans there which should
honestly be acting as an intake because
there is a dust filter over on this side
for these three fans I left in the
orientation they are purely for
aesthetics oh don't hate on me for that
when I do follow up and test the system
I'll flip those around so they're
pulling air in rather than pushing air
out right now we have very negative
pressure in this case which isn't an
ideal scenario and I also wanted to
point out that with this motherboard
since we have the USB 3.1 gen2 plug as
I'll plug that in so we're now fully
maxed out on our front panel IO there as
well I wish I could give you guys more
information on the system like actually
testing it and everything but I'm not
allowed to do that quite yet but you
should stay tuned to my channel for when
I am allowed to do that because I will
be following up with some benchmark
tests on the 9900 kay very soon as soon
as I am allowed to share that with you
guys but of course all the parts I used
in today's build the fastest gaming PC
you can currently build within reason
for a single GPU are all listed down in
the video's description so check that
out hit thumbs up button if you enjoyed
this video thanks again for watching
guys and we'll see you next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
