next week guys weariness when ex week
was setting in all right 1920 by 1080 we
should be at 30 frames per second bit
rate looks okay we should now be a
streaming to YouTube as well hello
YouTube
and hello twitch and hello everyone
who's watching this is awesome hardware
it is a live show and we've been on
hiatus for like a month we we had
Christmas we whole Christmas break for
the holidays I got sick and then it was
C yes and now we're back
we almost weren't back because technical
difficulties to start off the show today
xsplit sucks now and although it still
remains our best option for dual
streaming as we usually do every week
the show to both twitch and YouTube so
we seem to have it functional now if
there's a delay or anything like that
we're sorry we can't do anything about
it we've we've we're already about a
half an hour late starting the show
today so we're doing the best we can
kicking off 2018 on just a great notes
as we watch with a late start and all
that but we've just we've just recently
returned from Las Vegas Nevada
we did some CES coverage out there last
may god available on both of our
channels haven't already checked the
death thank Audrey but I'm really glad
to be back days in Vegas is - yeah it
was a long time in Vegas and quick
disclaimer to start the show we do drink
some some beer occasionally we say bad
words and foul language adult time it's
only you really completely negate the
purpose of doing of doing
that's our it's setting them up to know
what kind of show this really I don't do
disclaim if they didn't believe us now
they do that's true nothing has been
proven also if you guys are interested
please check out our stores and you can
buy stuff Paul Sartre dotnet is my store
I got some mouse pads some some hoodies
some mugs bottle openers key caps all
great stuff also over on councilor bit
with tech slash store you can buy stuff
there too it's all very nice very nice
things stripped to you straight from
Vermont
if you get something from both of our
stores during this show will yell
Johnson at you TV well double Johnson
actually continue yeah if you yeah you
either if you buy it just from one of
our stories gives single Johnson two
stories double John's I forgotten how
the show works it's been so long I
downstream says I feel it feels kinda
wide range though yeah it's new exact
brand new show so so that we should have
just started it back in episode 1 yeah
welcome to Episode V CEQ this meaning a
brand new show for reasons I'm not going
to delve into I do not have a great
amount of preparation for today's
reasons reason no no we're not going
into that but I mean I do have some tech
news to talk about so we're gonna dive
into that we're gonna talk a little bit
about GPU prices although more of that
on Kyle's half of the show I was going
to talk about Bitcoin cuz man Bitcoin
had a rough day today I've got the GTX
10 8 10 50 TI max Q whoo and then some
jellyfish Ram cuz that's also very
exciting jellyfish but let's get started
with the first thing wait did we do
everything we usually do in the show
oh yeah we have you know what can i
crack the bottle open of oh yeah yeah um
I don't know how you guys enjoyed your
holiday season and stuff last year but I
enjoyed mine a lot and we saw big
celebrate Christmas and stuff one of my
cousins actually on whyphy sauce aside
brews their own beer actually a couple
my cousins do Oh
they're brothers and they they brew
their own beer with their dad and it's
really good and this is actually their
beer that they brewed Sinha gene mama
Sinha mama I don't know sinha grandmama
I'm not exactly sure what it's called
bassy grandma yeah and it's a it's a
sweet at the point they're trying to
it's a sweet stout and I'm gonna drink
it right now I've been dying to drink
this beer for a very long time so it's
also got the the actual wax like they
dipped it in wax to seal it yeah really
oh very is that gonna work yeah you just
gonna I'm just gonna drags off we're
gonna dig under the wax I'm
I'm not very good at bottles all right
yeah I'm nervous
well good I'm better that's and much is
I'm much the sharp edge yeah the guy
can't handle I see the direction you're
give the guy who can't handle bottles of
razor sharp wait you got towards the
body like towards my body at neck level
I think is what I'm kidding no I'm see
that's what I was thinking I was cutting
it away from from my head but then it's
also kind of towards you if I were just
like wow yeah that's why wait so I don't
know how I've never actually hold on I'm
just gonna shave it off a little bit
this is why we were late I was trying to
open a bottle that's it's all here now
yeah that's all I contributed but
contributing no the brew the brew of it
you got it the brew like kit the brew
setup that they have is is pretty insane
they have like the giant tank slightly
converted an entire garage just further
there their home brew system
it looks like Breaking Bad in there so
they know what they're doing for the
most part all let's go ahead and pour
some we'll give this a shot you can go
ahead and keep rambling Paul while I see
your bootleg your relatives yep all
right let's start off with the story
number one here a Bitcoin oh my gosh
 they just have a picture of a guy
committing suicide is that what this is
this so dark
Danika we learned nothing from logan
paul bitcoin has plunged ahead of really
wrong yeah don't even pulse coming to
kinda look I know I can't down 47% from
back in December when all the Bitcoin
miners were all super excited look it's
it's so bad that coin desk doesn't even
one load for me and give me what the
actual price is right now right now yes
oh no I'm kind of nervous it's nervous
it's it's literally pacing back and
forth that's how nervous it is to show
you what Bitcoin pricing is right now
it dropped as low as ten thousand three
hundred today
last I checked as just oh just before
the show started it rebounded just
slightly was at 11,500
but that's down that's down pretty
pretty significantly that's 25% drop
over the last 24 hours
down 47% from the high back in December
of $19,500 in fact this is across the
board for every major cryptocurrency
right now has suffered double digit
losses over the past 24 hours
atheria down 28% yeah come on cash down
31% like going down 29% - down 24%
Monero is down 30% it's just do we know
do we know what causes these huge drops
not specifically I mean there's there's
varying factors if you want to talk
about the drop in general right now it's
probably due to a bit of a bubble I mean
whether it's a bubble and how much of a
bubble and all that kind of talk
it is speculative and you know I don't
know that much more than the next person
but here the big climb that have made
you know November December and the end
of 2017 this is a bubble and this is
people who don't know anything about
cryptocurrency mining you just see
something that's of value trading on
Wall Street whatever okay it's a
valuable thing and it's getting more
valuable I should buy that and wait for
it to be more valuable and then sell it
so you had a bubble and then you have
people selling stuff and that's how it
goes now we can also blame Jay it's very
possible to just blame Jay all J small J
posts video earlier today
he's dickhole very critical of
cryptocurrency mining if market crashes
and that's just what see Khun damaging
that's we can just blame Jake stop it
Jay that's another possibility there's
lots of factors that influence the
market we have to we have to we have to
realize that at the core of everything
whether you're talking about Bitcoin any
other cryptocurrency or just the cash
that you have in your wallet it's all
just made up
it only has any value because we agree
that it has value that's true and so
Bitcoin becomes more valuable when more
people think it has more value it's like
real money and then people start
thinking maybe it's not as valuable as
it was and then that starts losing value
isn't the start stock market fund we
should just we should all just like to
be like Jay and just tell people what to
think there's they there's a thing yeah
that's a great business it's a great
business mom we should give a mark two
cents yeah that I mean I mean once
that's enforced there are there are
there is value to some degree in
cryptocurrency III appreciate
cryptocurrency because it's
decentralized there's no World Bank or
something some shady group of
individuals who are somehow sanest
reasonable hand and everything yeah
granted there are Bitcoin influencers
who have massive farms who in the past
especially going back to like the
2013-2014 timeframe I've been accused of
influencing the market to significant
degrees like when it originally went
from the couple hundred dollars all the
way up to a thousand lots to be
discussed there but nothing that we have
the depths to go into further for
today's show all this is to say that
Bitcoin lost a lot of value today so if
you have a lot of Bitcoin than you lost
some money sorry I run that you show
maybe it'll bounce back it's probably
well there's articles going around today
about some dude who's like hey that's
gonna be worth a hundred K and maybe
that will have this is not the did we
mention this is not show where you
should come to get financial advice no
all right well you're not liable over on
wucf tech we have a little bit of news
about video cards video cards suck right
now there's they're so expensive
so expect like when I went to CES and
video cards is like doubled in price
across the board yeah I came back home
and I was like everything what
absolutely my brother-in-law asked me
yesterday he's like hey I'm looking to
build the workstation PC flight video I
hang wrong sign is anything on my
budgets like $1200 you know it's warning
if you could like build me a parts list
it was like sure so like I got home as
like 8:00 9:00 p.m. and I was like just
started good
what on PC part picker it's really good
right yeah yeah good job could you have
Brandon don't you guys did awesome and I
was like oh you know what for 1,200
bucks you can get a GTX 10-8 1070 I was
like we could probably fit a 1070 in
there and I look at the prices and I was
like what happened yeah they're like 700
bucks and what the hell they were like
almost the price of a 1080 TI yeah I
couldn't believe it does the first time
I checked GPU prices since before we
left for Vegas which was like 10 days
ago
yeah we're literally not in its time
were just right now like we're hoping
like like some of the people who talked
to
at CES like EVGA said that they have a
bunch more coming in so when new cards
come in hopefully they'll be a different
price or at least maybe a brief period
of time where you can get them for a
dime a sharpie or at least close to it
but but yeah it's it's it's very
challenging to be in a situation where
you try to encourage people to build
their own computer because right now
your best option is to go to a boutique
or a complete you buy a complete system
because those you can still get the
whole system's
like it takes them longer to like
increase in price and there's less
because I already have a bunch yeah we
gotta buy the whole system so boutique
builders and full complete builds it's
like the best option right now when it
comes to value for your money
other things you to say that anyway
someone related just because it's a GPU
is it 1050 Ti max Q this is a design
that just leaked out just the fact that
it exists was leaked in a change log for
Linux when they have when they're
updating their Linux display driver was
a 1050 and 1050 Ti max Q design this is
a different because in the past nvidia
has limited max q they've established a
standard of performance so max q
notebooks up till now have only included
gtx ten 70s and gtx ten 80s but they're
apparently working on a 1050 TI max q
version which is probably going to mean
that it's like really power efficient so
like you're gonna get okay
gaming performance because apparent it's
a 1050 or 1050 Ti but like it really
limited or minimal impact to battery
life on a notebook which yes could you
do this well for a notebook especially
if you want a game let me go or
something like that this is also
probably going to compete with the keep
you like G lineup of CPUs has recently
announced that are gonna have rx Vega
and then Marc's Vega mg/l chips to be
specific and then W CCF's tech speculate
so and I think this is based on the
original article which came from video
cards calm that the clock speeds are
going to be in the fort 14 17 megahertz
to 1450 megahertz so in the mid 14
hundredths and that translates to a
theory a theoretical graphics
performance of 2.18 teraflops
and granted you cannot always directly
compare teraflop numbers between
different GP families but that should
make it at least somewhat competitive
with what's am DS rolling out so for you
laptop users who like to game on the go
and maybe looking for a nice reasonably
powered laptop maybe that's a good apps
report yeah hey laptops aren't really
affected by the GPU of other GPU prices
right through there you do we know if
it's a 1050 TI like it's a full full
desktop version of it or it's the mobile
version right I mean like what they use
what they do I would expect it to be
roughly the same in part when it comes
to CUDA cores and that kind of thing
like that's what they said about the
1070 and 1080 thinks this is the full
actual gtx 1070 yeah you know with the
same amount of memory and everything
like that the fact is they can't run at
the same frequency they're gonna run
three four hundreds slower right because
the amount of power it's using the
amount of heat that can be dissipated
actually in a very small area and a
laptop yeah so that's what I would
expect probably the same same actual
GPUs whether they're gonna package them
actually on a substrate with the with
the chip like I don't know if they if
they're going that that way or that kind
of thing that's a question that would be
a good way to make a better
implementation for a max Q classified
laptop because you can fit everything in
there in a smaller package but that's
just speculation there so yeah yeah I
think that least a 1050 Ti would be if
they had a down clock it probably would
be like they probably would have to down
clock the 1050 Ti as much as like a 10
60 or 1070 right because it runs fairly
cool party very power if has a desktop
part yeah its power fishing too so you
might actually be getting you know
closer to the real desktop part with the
1050 TI then you would like a 1070 max Q
for example yeah that's kind of me so
much probably won't have have too much
overclocking Headroom but it depends on
the laptop I mean different
manufacturers to make different laptops
there's no better there's no set
standard like NVIDIA has to cut has to
approve and say yes this can be max Q
but they have to be really thin but
there's no exact specification for
thinness right so case but you know you
could have a situation where you have a
better cooling unit and and and then it
can run the GPU faster yeah something
like that but maybe it's a little bit
thicker yeah all right let's move on
don't you guys use BitTorrent I use I
use BitTorrent sync IRAs Ilya but this
is for users to BitTorrent in general
and very specifically if you use the
transmission BitTorrent app it's like
for downloading movies for yes
downloading basically the car you aren't
that you don't freely distributing
content on the Internet you would she
clearly is not copyrighted or anything
like that's and definitely is not hacked
programs or apps or anything like that
but if you use BitTorrent you should be
aware of a flaw that was recently made
public in the BitTorrent specifically
the transmission BitTorrent app but the
article indicates that it might be
something that that could possibly
affect other software based on the
BitTorrent protocol as well so this is
critical weakness in the transmission
app that allows websites to execute
malicious code on some users computers
the researcher who discovered this is
named Tavis or Mandi he's with Google's
Project zero vulnerability reporting
team
most recently made famous for their
surfacing of Spectre and meltdown
normally project zero with holds
publication of such details for 90 days
or until the developer has released a
fix in this case however Orman DS
private report to transmission included
a patch that completely fixed the
vulnerability so not only was he like
hey guys there's a flaw in your software
a security flaw but here's the patch to
fix it but they and he ended up
releasing the disclosing the
vulnerability last Tuesday only 40 days
after the initial report because
transmission developers had yet to apply
it so he gave them over a month he's
like hey guys here's a security flaw
here's the patch waited over a month
forty days they did nothing so he's like
alright I'm just gonna make this public
because if someone else found out about
it who was a you know maybe a black hat
you know
hacker or something like that and they
can do something malicious it's also a
way of pushing that company to be like
now that's public so you better patch it
and want to maintain customers and faith
in your software and that kind of thing
it's a proof of concept the proof of
concept attack that our MIDI put
together exploits a transmission
function that allows users to control
the BitTorrent app with their web
browser and it uses a hacking technique
known as domain name system rebinding
the most immediate consequences are for
transmissions users as already mentioned
but the dangers of DNS rebinding are
broadly applicable to people using a
wide range of apps so if you're using
BitTorrent software maybe check the
forum's of that software see if there's
any discussion of this see if there's
any updates just make sure make sure you
patch and keep yourself safe keeping
yourself safe cool
this kind of dropped well or just before
we went to Computex and there was lots
of news in the past week about it but
intel's specter and milton well specter
and meltdown critical flaws in some
fundamental functionality of the way
CPUs work intel particularly susceptible
to both spectra and meltdown and so they
have been working on patches and when it
comes to patches there's software
patches so if you get a Windows if
you've gotten a Windows Update in the
past week there's a decent chance that
was dealing with these vulnerabilities
to some degree but there's also BIOS
updates that will actually update the
micro code and your CPU and in order to
be completely safe from these you're
gonna want to do both however the bios
fixes that intel has released at least
as of four days ago have been causing
crashes on Broadwell and Haswell based
systems so increased crashes it's not
like apparently the system just doesn't
work or whatever but intel has issued a
statement confirming that bios patches
for the update Buller for the spectre
vulnerability are causing crashes on
Broadwell and Haswell systems customers
have reported higher system reboots this
is a this safe way of saying crashes
after applying the updates affecting
Broadwell core i3 i5 and i7 5,000 series
on the mobile side has well core i3 i5
and i7
they weren't specific about Broadwell Li
and whether it's affected so potentially
of course i7 6000 series of the desktop
well
desktop as well protect and then as
mentions if you want to protect yourself
from these you're gonna want to get a
BIOS update you definitely want to get a
BIOS update for whatever computers that
you use soon I tried to do a quick bit
of additional research right before we
started but again I was limited on time
today to see if there were further
updates on this so definitely gonna want
to keep talking I use a little bit more
on this on Kyle's half as well but once
you see that your motherboard
manufacturer or your laptop manufacturer
has issued an update an actual BIOS
update I would just check and see make
sure it's functioning properly because
you obviously don't want to deal with a
bunch of crashes like this especially if
it's a system that you use for work or
something like that but yeah hopefully
within the next couple weeks we'll have
both the software and the hardware side
set up at least for meltdown Spectre has
potentially more long term thanks did
you download the Intel BIOS update and I
haven't done any actual BIOS updates yet
and that's the type of thing I'm I
haven't had time just cuz was gonna say
yes and also waiting to make sure the
BIOS updates are stable because there's
also the potential for them to affect
performance depending on the use case of
your computer and that kind of thing
Intel didn't bundle their BIOS update in
the Windows Update right no thanks I'm
great it's separate like it's G if you
go to their like an Intel website you'll
have to get you know well Intel will
distribute the best in Intel working on
the fixes will work with their hardware
partners like MSI gigabyte asu's to
implement their to include the microcode
update for the CPU as part of a BIOS
update so you'll download the BIOS
update from your motherboard
manufacturers website or potentially if
you have a laptop your laptop
manufacturers what that website maybe
put that on an external USB or something
there's various ways to update your BIOS
right update that that should patch your
CPU micro code in order to make you I
don't want to say immune but much less
vulnerable than you
would have been beforehand but obviously
there's this is a work in progress all
this stuff came out within the past week
and a half to two weeks and there's lots
of potential issues they're trying to do
this in such a way to minimize to
minimize impact on actual performance
and that kind of thing as well so yeah
hopefully we'll bring more to you on
this next week and we'll sort of let you
know our feel on the situation also once
we've been able to started taking a deep
breath and get past getting getting back
from Vegas and Computex and everything I
never feel like that like the holiday
season is over until Computex is over
yeah and then I feel like it means I
need like a week to just recover and
yeah anyway alright yeah
jellyfish Ram jellyfish jelly Ram
jellyfish oh I was like why are we ran
ting about jellyfish then well I'm now
Thank You Lera fine I can rant about
that alright done have you've clarified
what the hell is jellyfish I'm gonna
clarify at the beginning of this story
that it should not be called jellyfish
Ram Oh a data if you're watching need to
change the name of this should be see
jellies sea jellies sea jellies yes why
sea jellies because as I learned very
recently from one of my sisters who
brought this up for no apparent reason
see a jellyfish is sort of a misnomer
because a jellyfish is not really a fish
it's not fish shape it's not the same
type of organism as a fish it's not in
the same class or whatever
same thing with sea stars or starfish
starfish or no sea stars cuz it's a star
that's not a fish it's a sea star so sea
jelly is more accurate and appropriate
than palm fish it makes sense
and ya know I was I was initially very
hesitant to agree to this as well myself
it's like no it's a jellyfish I've
learned jellyfish I grew up with that is
what my might but once it was explained
to me as a car yeah that can fish it
looks like it's like a it's like a
flying saucer with tentacles on the
bottom or something like that right
there yes there's no it's not nothing
fish about you know dorsal fin that's
kind of fishy gills right
Skeptical bet anyway what is xpg the xpg
series is it has a jellyfish project a
data and this is it alright so obviously
it's got our GB LEDs on it we should
clarify that right from the beginning
there are still RGB LEDs on this but
China in an attempt to perhaps to
differentiate themselves or just try
something a little bit new ad to have
this concept memory this concept DRAM
they were showing it off at CES and this
article's from an antic they went over
and checked it out if you look at this
video
look there's liquid you can see the
launch yeah there's liquid inside
shimmery it's actually touching the
modules yeah they're using a sealed
clear plastic case around the memory
chips and then they're filling it with a
non conductive liquid in this case 3m
Novak floor inert which is a synthetic
chemical that's created by 3m it's it's
liquid at room temperature but can
eventually change state into gas and
rise I'm guessing it probably a lower
temperature than the normal water this
is perhaps 3m the same ones that make
the adhesive yeah they make adhesives
and chemicals and all that kind of stuff
very very very trustworthy company
interesting uh but yeah so when when
when you have a phase change when you
change from liquid to gas there it
requires a lot of energy so the energy
being the heat that's generated by the
memory modules transferred in the liquid
changes to phase and then it cools down
there has to be some sort of dissipation
I'm not sure how it dissipates through
the plastic is shown in the video there
whatever but whatever cools then goes
back to liquid and and you have almost
like almost like a little vapor chamber
to some is inside of the module that's
it that was kind of disappointed in the
video because smoking has the video just
just briefly shows this demo unit with
the with the water on it there was the
liquid in there but I'm not seeing it in
action right there's this picture up
here with lights on it but yeah I'm not
sure if it's actually functionally
functionable working or whatever but I
guess it's one of those kind of proof of
concepts the concept idea is that a data
is actually produced this phase change
actually helped performance at all or
thermals
is it just for sure I mean the idea is
to cool it more effectively so I would
hope that if they're going this far to
create this that they're seeing some
sort of results that indicate that it's
it's viable but but who knows maybe it's
just one of those random CES things
where they're like hey we made jellyfish
shrimp why do you need to cool your
memory anyway for 99.9% of scenario
because then you can overclock it more
that's that's usually the reason the
fluid they're using inside this
apparently there was there so there was
sort of Beckman when mineral oil cooled
species we're starting to become
something that people were aware of as a
thing they started to look like well
what other liquids could we use as long
as as long as it's a non-conductive
liquid you could put it in a PC so they
actually have been attempts in the past
to use the same liquid so like
completely cool PC or whatever but it's
expensive in fact it has probably become
more expensive
according to the article three hundred
dollars per gallon was what it used to
cost and we're not sure if that's
Imperial or metric by the way but adata
says that it is now about $100 per liter
which would be a little bit more than
what it costs back in a day but there's
not much required to put into each
memory module but obviously if if if
it's that expensive it would potentially
increase the cost it costs some also is
a problem that they're not completely
full so if you put it vertically in a
case like the top module might not
beginning yeah cooled so obviously
you're there's some kinks to work out
but although it is in the early stages
of development the a data x PG C jelly
ram it's very very exciting I don't know
or maybe not or perhaps it's not
exciting enough it seems weird I want a
full liquid cooling loops though that I
mean it'd be cool if your liquid cooling
because they match them they make memory
that you know you can put a little the
they put some side pins on and like a
unified block at the top serve the heat
and you can do a water cooling loop
through it or whatever it would be
interesting to have something where like
the liquid in your loop actually goes
through the memory the memory like you
like alongside like if there's a gene
1/4 inch fitting on either side of yeah
of the module well you have to put it in
a block of four and have to
like ten of them but then it would like
split out into four and like go through
it I mean that would that would be cool
looking at least that's that at least
sounds a bit more like this you have
radiators now cooling that liquid mm-hmm
right instead of just some like
invisible vapor chamber thing about
there
I'm I'm hoping I'm hoping a d2 goes
through with that memory is already
expensive enough we don't need to make
it more expensive slower named fancy
modules that might - all right let's
talk about the FCC a little bit's the
the fight for net neutrality is far from
over
more more actually on that neutrality
and Kyle's half of the show but real
quickly as predicted we we specifically
said that they were gonna try to do this
they have a plan to tell you that you
have ok Brant broadband and they're
gonna tell you that based on the fact
that they're lowering the standards for
what broadband is and what qualifies as
broadband the article here from ARS
technica specifically calls out this
mobile only challenge and this is a
response to the FCC's potential proposed
message measures which is to tell people
to try just going on try going mobile
only only use the data on your cell
phone never connect to Wi-Fi and see how
you do whether you have a data cap
whether you're satisfied with the speeds
whether you have anything of reasonable
size to possibly download or not see if
you're ok with the FCC telling you that
hey as long as you've got a mobile
connection as long as you're covered by
your 4G or whatever that's ok we don't
need to worry about compelling Internet
service providers to roll out broadband
in your area fiber or cable or anything
that's of a reasonable bandwidth the
standard that they're talking about is
10 megabit down and 1 megabit up they
may soon to declare that's America's
broadband deployment problem is solved
as long as everyone has access to either
fast home internet or cell your
cellulite or big keyword or cellular
internet service with speeds of at least
10 megabits per second the current
policy the one that's in that
that's that they're going by now is that
you should have access to both mobile
data and fast home Internet services
such as fiber cable at least 25 megabits
per second why not both which is
significantly faster than 10 megabits
per second and very key difference if
you're talking about streaming like 4k
video different difference from 10 to 25
is significant may give these per second
yeah if you hope you have anything that
has reasonable reasonable density and
especially if you're doing anything else
on your home network that also requires
network traffic 25 megabits per second
down and 3 megabits per second up is the
current standard I'd like to see that
uplink increased yeah but never mind
that they're talking about decreasing
those of the faders the new notice
suggests 10 megabits per second download
speeds and 1 megabits per second upload
speeds is significant sufficient and you
only need a wireless connection in order
to do that because you know like if you
want to we're gonna hop on and play some
video games right let me just tell it on
my phone real quick cuz that's super
convenient and fast when I get home why
he's lost now you're gonna like fire up
you know a big bag of popcorn turn the
lights down and we're gonna watch Gangs
of New York on our phone yeah that's
what everyone looks for just at the end
of the night so you guys I don't know
how how much this this media campaign is
gonna catch on mobile only or it every
bit feel free to give you give it a shot
trying to find mobile only all for a day
I shouldn't try this I have really good
mobile mobile plan it's unlimited
yeah well unlimited 4G and it and
there's no throttling once you get past
a certain point so you're lucky that's
actually a decent plan yeah but I am
lucky but not everyone has that yep all
right moving on last news story before
we move on to some questions is WPA 3
her a WPA 3 whooping talking about
improving Wi-Fi security by rolling out
this new standard the Wi-Fi Alliance is
the governing body who handles this sort
of thing sounds like a fun Wi-Fi
Alliance yeah the Wi-Fi Alliance
I have to come back soon to come back
the evil Wi-Fi the Imperial Wi-Fi and
imperial Wi-Fi scum scum
anyway that's which I assume involves
this lady here
there's just text just text in this
story come on ZDNet give me a give me an
image besides your crappy autoplay video
around bitches anyway though uh so Apple
Microsoft Qualcomm and other industry
leaders part of the Wi-Fi Alliance
Alliance announced on Monday the next
generation wireless network security
standard WPA three which will replace
wpa2 it's almost two decades old now
crazy I'm talking about I remember back
when back in the day when people had WEP
or WPA one whip encryption B I know you
switch to wpa2 but it's it's showing its
age now being being about twenty years
old and it's gonna help but that they
have key improvements for at WPA three
though but you're aiming to solve some
common security problems with current
standard open Wi-Fi networks being one
of them they've become much much much
more common
whether you're over at the your local
Starbucks or friend's house Wi-Fi or at
airport or whatever because wpa2 doesn't
have an individualized data encryption
and WPA three will that means that the
encryption that are that the data is
between your device and whatever router
that you're connected to that has WPA
three will be encrypted from from your
device to that router and then it's sent
off over the Internet based on that it's
free anyone anyone can access it no
hopefully you have hopefully you have
encryption from end to end as well but
just from your device to the router
that's a big improvement that will help
a lot of people from spying on wireless
data in public network scenarios this is
also going to protect against brute
force dictionary attacks which is useful
it's also going to block an attacker
after too many failed password guesses
so people actually trying to hack into
your router that kind of thing that's
useful and it's listing that's not
specific here but it says there's a
newer kind
handshake to securely allow new devices
with appreciate password onto the
network the wpa2 had a four way
handshake that it used for that WPA
three does not say but because a secret
secret it's still I mean I guess it's
got it's either secret or was just too
technical for those eating that article
to go into but point being more secure
WPA three yes everyone needs to buy new
rotors
I wonder how soon that they're gonna be
launching routers with that I don't know
they nested today so it expects products
to be available sometime this year I
don't know yeah usually I don't know if
you look at this is less of a security
thing and more of a bandwidth thing but
like if you're looking like 802 that'll
live in you know AC to like a X like
those product those standards usually
companies have devices already coming
out based on the standards before the
standards are even finalized might be
different with the security protocol
though I'm not not really sure but there
it is WPA 3 suite everyone by new
readers alright that is all I've got for
today for my story a little bit more to
talk about
on Cal saps the show I'm just going to
wrap things up with a bit of Q&amp;amp;A so if
you guys have had questions Oh actually
we've had some questions posted in chat
so we're gonna go over those thanks to
all of you guys who have done some
donations let's do it much obliged Scott
wick also thanks to sell for think so
for being our moderator and gathering
Scott dollars missed awesome hardware
ladies and I hope your holidays were
great and let's make 2018 great and make
lots of memories or money monies Paul
finished the HTPC yes Scott's new year's
resolution for Paul hey will
that's already automatic sorry in
progress it's in the chain I'm working
on it right now with my feet gonna fire
it off and all your faces thanks Scott
Tom's brems mitts I've read that name a
thousand times and it still trips me up
every time I say it's like a really
short tongue twister 15 or we didn't
thrown out if you know original Crona
finally back how are you both after CES
am I the only one who thought the CES
was a bit boring also what is your three
top three moments from CES
we are both tired after being back from
CES know you're not the only one who
thought CES was a little bit dry in
terms of new product releases and such
and top three moments from CES coming
home yeah coming home was an a matter
when I won like a hundred of em which I
went like a hundred and something
dollars playing blackjack oh nice
yeah that's right that was there yeah
that was like the last gambling I did
all week by the way me too
really I mean I think I'd like blader
that night but I was like you were you
were like on fire for it for Wow I was
like gamble no no no but then yeah yes
I'm some money gambling
and oh I went to buck it all oh you did
I went to market on the last day
bacchanal is the number one buffet in
hotel Bert no no number one buffet in
Vegas that's a Caesar's Palace Hotel go
there
it's transcendental I don't know I think
I was kind of getting over being sick
all week and stuff so yeah it wasn't it
wasn't the best to see yes yes yeah
loudly I mean NZXT came out with a
motherboard that was interesting yeah
that was like I've been expected but
apart from just a couple random
surprises you know we're kind of in the
middle of some big silicon launches I
think so yeah not even you know not even
motherboard vendors were really ready
for like X 470 for example for the new
second chin dries and chips I was
expecting to see more of those after AMD
made their announcement but yeah
gigabyte was the only one who had one
yep yeah all right subjects copy text
why that's more grads studios $10 sup
from Monroe Michigan I booked this a to
you 70 PC with a 1080 TI because of your
build with me video nice first PC I've
ever built turned out great thanks Cal
looking forward to new content from both
you awesome sweet I'm glad you liked
that build video that tutorial that
helped you and good luck with your
future PC I agree
means with your current PC in future
thanks $5
happy new guys my Tuesday evenings have
been boring during your brief hiatus mmm
glad you guys are back and doing well
Cheers from El Jefe have a cheers right
back to you we are yes you exist we're
glad to be back
speeding things started off in 2018 with
a slow roll I got I got sort of a like
just sad like I got sort of like a
postpartum depression you know after we
hadn't done awesome Hardware for so long
oh really I missed that show I think
someone came up to me was at CES like a
fan random fan dude I love awesome
Hardware all over there so when I watch
it every week yeah we haven't done in
like three weeks I'm like I miss it too
crying on each others such as it's such
a standard it is really the right janeck
tariff issue of course air light node or
late
no plugged in power strips and
everything but for some reason it's not
working I don't know if it's a firmware
thing or something cannot find a decent
installation video please help of course
they're lighting no I have not
I don't even brush the lighting node at
this point that's what hooks up to the
ll series fans right the L RGB fans the
lighting lighting node Pro whatever Wow
yeah I mean it's all part of their RGB
ecosystem watch my video on the ll
series RGB fans that I posted a couple
months back I briefly go into some
detail about the lighting node Pro and
how to hook it up and connect it all
that's all I can really say until you
know I come into your house and look at
it myself but good luck pop mr. Shepherd
oh five dollars
I hope Kyle enjoyed my mug mail slash
mail time mail is in someone with a
leaner slash mail as in you know
envelopes being sent to someone just
time check to check in the mail slash
meal time I have not checked my P o box
yet I probably haven't checked it in
like months which is really bad bad on
me but I waited since before the last
awesome hardware so yeah and now when I
see that something's been sent from from
you pub yep I will know that it's a mug
thank you
I'm sure it's a great mug can't wait to
drink out of it Fred grant twenty
dollars if Kyle has children
if Kyle has changed in his pocket
doesn't make it bitcoins
haha see what you did there because
you're uh yep bit Kyle - that would
count Bitcoin sorry could not resist it
yeah obviously I mean how could you not
it was the best joke that I will ever
hear in my life I think your
cryptocurrency should be called bit one
one I don't know it cuz it's a money
it starts with wbw I don't know okay
oh I thought you meant like one like wow
like the like the Mexican guy's name no
not like one bit one fun I'm like what
are you uh what are you trying to save
huh and about me my people
you're not even why is the white man
Mexican coming in here into my house
calling music wad
an Asian that you don't tell me what I
am Mexican no I see so now you define me
but based on my based on my culture yeah
it's my people
exactly all right thanks Fred frickin
I'm Stephen Hill fifty dollars last
evening Stephen Stephen I'm terrified if
my 1080 ever dies on me with the current
prices knocking on wood light breezy
happy new year ended up getting a new
pup I hope y'all are well hopefully it
wasn't pup Shepard that'd be a totally
different story but interesting you know
congratulations on your new puppy and
happy holidays I guess and I think Liv I
think if your eternity has been fine up
till now it'll still be fine yeah it's
it takes a lot to you're in to really
kill a functional graphics card that's
true
nowhere near relevant alright Andres
Rivero good either
ten dollars threader per second Jen
comes in 2018 2019 will it run on the
same threader for four boards available
now Verizon has been confirmed to be
compatible for rise in second gen what
about threader be honest opinion please
I think it will
i I mean I would I would guess yes I
give you if you if I had to just make a
choice right now if we like all right
choose yes it'll be compatible no it
won't I would say yes if I was giving
you a percentage I'd say 60 70 % yes
that's so kind of R&amp;amp;D Oh again 60 70 %
yes that'll matter to a final poll but
still a decent chance that because it's
it's it's means I mean it's high-end
it's a high-end platform and to it that
also might be derivative somewhat of
where epic goes in their server line
because it's the same soccer their
server using that server to use so I'm
sure that will have an impact on it they
can do something similar like what
they're doing with rice and I rise in
second gen you know mainstream is is
that you know they'll have a new socket
further high-end desktop platform that
would still be compatible
with old first-generation thread Ripper
and you know vice versa but maybe you'll
get a couple additional features with
the newer platform you already mean that
might might sort of incident or convince
some people to switch over or to upgrade
or to buy into X $4.99 or whatever they
want to call it but AMD so far has been
showing us that they are super open to
they like the baccarat ability yeah
which is good let's say very it's a good
distinct distinction between them and
Intel and it's one of the things that
Intel gets people give Intel for
and so it's definitely something that I
am Dee is very smart in saying like hey
we we offer backwards compatibility so
hahaha yeah right thanks for the
question though
Haydon pesco 10 Australian I had two
questions first I'm planning on getting
an Acer xB 271 HU and also a high-end
card like a 1080i should I get the 1080i
now or wait for bolta get the tangs yeah
well hold on a second monitor a graphics
card first only money for one at the
moment depends on what you have now I
mean do you are you running integrated
graphics cuz in the monitors kind of a
waste or do you have something that
could at least run you know reasonably
well on on that panel xB to 7 is 27-inch
what g-sync display with that 65 1441 65
well 144 hurts but it's overclocking up
to 165 yeah so honestly right now is not
a not the best time to buy a GPU
especially in the high-end don't buy a
high end GPU right now you're you're
paying like 50 percent over MSRP or or
more yeah or well more weight way more
so I would hold off on that unless you
absolutely need it right now but most
people don't i if you had to if you're
just like looking to scratch that itch
then buy the monitor because the monitor
pricing is probably not going to change
much over the next few months
yep and very least like the GPU pricing
so high right now you would think that
may be the only place for it to go is
back
at a certain point when supplied goes
back up or something like that or demand
goes down a little bit but yeah don't go
buy a GPU right now do not do it
automatic met five dollars hey man hey
guys any idea when 10 80s will be less
than $800 trying to build an AC PC
gaming machine for my barracks room dude
no no sorry
we don't have that insider information
yeah you did if you really need a
graphics card for a build right now the
best option we can recommend is to keep
like start like follow your your
favorite GPU manufacturers on Twitter
and that kind of thing tweet them and
ask them like when they have new
shipments coming in because when when
EVGA dumps 200 new graphics cards on
newegg is when you'll have maybe a few
hours to go in there and buy one at MSRP
or maybe slightly above new Ike
sometimes over prices cards but yeah
it's we're all kind of in the same boat
that you are cuz we're really we would
like graphics cards prices to come down
as well even though we don't necessarily
need new graphics cards because we have
some graphics cards we like to talk to
you guys about graphics secure it's time
to recommend in building computers and
it's hard to say linking look here's
this computer I built it's only two
thousand dollars it has a GTX testes
yeah right
what no yeah that's crappy you don't
like it we're gonna look on that board
again one five Australian looking guys
even if you don't like my suite designed
for the baby oil t-shirt oh well like
like we may have liked it maybe we just
links for the room thing Willington
print them is uh it's got to go beyond
like it's true they've already gone
daniel hood five dollars thank you for
your hard work thank you for your
support Thank You Daniel appreciate it
didn't go on my $45.00 welcome back yes
you guys like all your videos you
uploading during CES eight plus plus I
want to see some bloopers oh man every
video is a blooper uh no I wasn't really
planning on it and
if I'm gonna go back did you do a a
CES shelf lore video no wow
nope neither died I just did I left I
left literally boots I left a little
early from CES on Thursday night and so
I didn't go to the show floors went to
the show floor once for like one hour oh
yeah and I was like I have the rest of
the day to potentially walk around see
everything I was so spent I was just so
tired I was like and I still had more
stuff to shoot back at the hotel room
like my voiceover stops okay I'll just
watch the LG OLED tunnel on YouTube yeah
I don't just see it as being Victor s
2210 New Zealand New Zealand New Zealand
didn't I don't know what they're called
in New Zealand Dollars New Zealand New
Zealand Dollars New Zealand bucks is
probably the official name Jesus
America's internet sucks oh I thought
you were gonna go all religious on us
I'm from New Zealand haha
figure that out and I have 1000 megabits
per second down and 1000 megabits per
second up unlimited for a hundred and
ten dollars per month well there there
are places in America where you can get
that kind of service it's mainly where a
Google Fiber was deployed and it's
actually cheaper than what you're paying
for
oh yeah gigabit both ways oh yeah but
you have to be lucky enough to be
somewhere where Google fiber's to played
and that's pretty limited right now
we're like Kansas and yeah it's like
Kansas in a couple other places I forget
I don't live there so don't care thank
you doctor thank you thank you five
dollars tell your sister that jelly is
made with fruit jelly fish are
gelatinous so she has to call them see
jell-o's see jell-o's
that's that's the logic checks out that
makes sense to me
I'm I'm I'm okay with that yeah
jellyfish and I also make some jelly
jelly also makes them seem more
delicious next time I see a see jello at
the beach I'm just gonna go out
just take a big ol bite us seen yellow
hope it's cherry flavored it's alive
literally that's Shane Pete $1 I am
rocking the Z 95 I 5 4690k mostly for
gaming when do you think I should
upgrade
I was thinking rising 2 or should I wait
longer resin two might be a good
potential I mean you got a decent setup
right now
yeah where do six time decays very
slowly gaming gaming a chip especially
if you got it over collect a little bit
although I heard z97 that platform is
not getting support for all the specter
meltdown updates really yes that's
stupid
yeah it's one of the bullet points in my
article for my half the show well then
we don't know you're you're being left
behind we don't know if you guys are
gonna be out of luck or if they're
planning to go back that far and beyond
we don't we don't really know but right
now your system is vulnerable and
there's no passion sight for you so
maybe that's that's F that might impact
maybe maybe that's enough to upgrade
sooner than later but right now I wonder
I would wonder if motherboard
manufacturers individually would would
be like would think you would do updates
themselves maybe I'm not sure maybe but
yeah that's definitely something to keep
an eye on yeah overall that resin to
when it does launch march/april
timeframe this year it would probably be
a decent upgrade for you because you
could go from a quad core without hyper
threading up to like a 6 or an 8 core
with multi multi threading yeah
march/april we rise in 7 right we'll be
launching that first I don't know if
they've they got any specifics as far as
what what chips they'll launch in what
order I mean if they do it in the same
way that they launched the original
Rison then yeah they would start with
Rison 720 800 X and I think I got that
slide I mean as a public slide they're
like you can use this in your video but
I remember like the timeline or whatever
it was like risin 7 then rise in 5 then
the rise in 5 AP used on the rise in 3
and then rise in 3p use that's also
possible ocean like that hey I could I
could just be not recalling that
immediately right now or I've just
leaked a bunch of NDA info and
we'll never work with me I know until
AMD everyone's signing off no no no
commit tech industry seppuku
all right leave me child put the $5
I've missed you Phoebe I've missed you a
lot you guy missed our few weeks Oh TV
was completely out of Luke I'm sorry
Phoebe yeah we should have updated you
personally I get it holiday ceas etc
welcome back
wait wait I don't even know how to read
this last part here bees it's backwards
odds backwards how did you pick up that
so fast I'm Dyslexic you heard this
Mexican okay thank you
thank you very much TV for me it's been
too long okay Thank You TV
it's come full circle all right
Christian t-50 dick no DKK was that
democratic Congo Korea of Congo Korean
coins with a K anyone it for any rate at
any rate thanks for the 50 something 50
things considering upgrade Spanish
damaged obviously Danish go for a Danish
Danish considering upgrading to a 1050
ti however I'm not sure this would be an
upgrade going from a GTX 670 to gigabyte
Cheers 670 it would be it would
definitely be an upgrade in power
efficiency yeah you might see around the
same performance so that wouldn't be
huge I would say a 1066 gigabyte at
least I mean triple that frame buffer
because if you just yeah and 10 sixties
yeah you know they're not super great
mining cards I mean they're not like
amazing mining cards so their price
hasn't been affected quite as much as
some of the higher understood they're
still also dead
they're still all sold out though so
maybe you know again maybe not the best
maybe not the best day that's times
every time to buy and really it is it
really is a bad time to upgrade it's
like the absolute word I've never seen
it this bad
patience is virtue Su Su Sousa
that's how you pronounce that name $5
Thank You Sousa if people want to go
with the used market instead of paying
inflated prices what cards should people
be looking for
that's like saying what kind of car
should you drive get whatever card you
think is gonna be able to run the games
that you want to play at the frame rates
and performance that you want to play
them at oh ho Jesus $400 for a 1060
these are sold directly by new egg - new
egg is just directly selling them at
this price and it's a three gigabyte
it's a three gigabyte 1060 going for
four hundred what does amazon selling it
for probably the same holy yet do not
buy any GPUs right now our tender fees
but 1050 Ti is being affected as much
everything at from even tenders dude
this literally happened like overnight
well no it was well over you're gonna
see I know but it just for me like it
since we were at CES just came back and
just walked on that's crazy
alright but those are all the questions
that you guys had for this half of the
show 1054 135 dollars that's not that's
that's 30 bucks more than it should be
yeah it just doesn't seem as much
because it's already of a low price to
begin with but doesn't mean it hasn't
inflated 750ti 180 they're usually
around 150 yeah cray cray cray
we have some Johnson shoutouts for y'all
oh yeah let's see I've got one Johnson -
Jed good old Jed CPU cooler shirt Thank
You Jed Matt from Canada Matt from
Canada I get the other mousepad thank
you very much Anna Johnson team Matt Jed
gets a double Johnson judo team Jess

desk mats like the big long one
Davi daveed got a are David sorry
BIOS flash shirt evolution shirt a
swordfight shirt and a bit whit white
logo Navy tri-blend shirt holy crapola

tri-blend t-shirt as well as a woman's a
woman's t-shirt I can't forget those
ladies y'all it is Denise all right okay
so guys it's gonna wrap it up for my
half of the show it has been roughly one
hour it is not seven o'clock we're gonna
have switched over to cows half so I'm
gonna update my link in the description
so check the link in the description to
go over to cows half do it it's on bit
wit true and we'll be right back so so
thanks for watching hit the thumbs up
button and if you're watching on twitch
