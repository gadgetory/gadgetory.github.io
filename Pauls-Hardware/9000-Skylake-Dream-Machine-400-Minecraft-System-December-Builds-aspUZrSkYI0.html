builds video this is the builds video
for December 2015 so today I'm going to
be choosing parts for a new computer
actually for two new computers because
that is a hard thing to do for some
people or maybe it's challenging
or maybe it's fun I think it's fun but
some people have a difficult time making
their decisions when it comes to the
parts are going to put into a system so
that's why I make these videos each
month I create a couple builds these are
based on your votes and your feedback I
use PC part picker to choose them so for
December I actually have based on your
feedback a ridiculous skylake sixty
seven hundred based dream a machine with
an over nine thousand dollar price tag
and then to balance things out with that
I also have a four hundred dollar range
AMD APU based system that I will
actually be building next week so
remember to subscribe to my channel if
you want to be the first to hear about
it when I post that video I was gonna
show you guys 500 cool features of the
fractal core 500 ITX case but that would
take way too long so here are five it's
compact and sleek with a brushed front
panel it has surprisingly good water
flowing support it has big magnetic dust
filters it supports full sized ATX power
supplies and it has room for 170
millimeter tall CPU coolers click the
sponsor link in the description for more
information so a few notes before we
dive right into the first builds perks
list first off the cost I'm listening
and the the title and everything is for
the the system itself that doesn't
include the monitor peripherals and that
kind of thing unless I say otherwise so
bear that in mind if you are parting on
a system there are some extra costs
involved but often times if you're a
system builder you might have those
already lying around that kind of thing
I also use PC part picker it's easy to
shop there and they also have compatibly
compatibility filters built in and that
kind of thing and links of course to all
this stuff is going to be down in the
description on YouTube
big thanks to anyone who's watching this
video live right now because I'm
streaming it live on my twitch channel
you guys are gonna have to wait for the
links I don't have them ready quite yet
but speaking of interaction and stuff
and why I chose the builds I'm doing
today is because I always ask you guys
what build do you want to see so last
months for November I asked what PC
builds USC for December and as you can
see the i7 I 760 700 K Scott
like dream machine one right at the top
FX 6300 came in a close second there I
do want you guys to vote the floor next
month too though so here I can post this
in chat there you go
so click that link in the description on
the straw poll and go ahead and vote oh
I meant to make this pick more than one
but I guess you only get to pick one
this time I got a farewell to am3+
builds insane forest coming out soon I
may be an 83 50 or maybe even a 95 90
build budget skylake since you got those
skylake Pentiums that are now available
that are super cheap I think I have a
search for them yeah you can give you
this G 4400 skylake Pentium for 65 bucks
now so I thought that might be
interesting 59 60 X a PC gaming
streaming system more bang for the buck
has well you gotta go for some older
slightly older parts we might go for
that so everyone post your your votes
there and that kind of thing and from
that for now I'm gonna get right into
this first build which is again that
6700 K dream machine dream machine for
me kind of harkens back to reading
maximum PC which is one of my favorite
PC publications at least in print for
quite some time and they always built a
dream machine every year so dream
machine for me it just means like going
all out but I'll be honest if you're
gonna just like build a system and
you're gonna make it like the most
expensive system possible it's really
not that hard you can go into site like
PC part picker and doing something like
that you can sort it by max price you
can choose all the most expensive
hardware and then you can just build it
with that I didn't quite do that I
wanted it to be somewhat reasonable but
that is why for example there are none
of these SSDs in there I did find these
last night Intel's for terabyte
Enterprise SSD which is selling a new
egg right now for $10,000 so I could
have dropped a few of these in there and
be like this is a $30,000 system that
would be awesome I know I didn't do that
I tried to keep things slightly more
reasonable so let's just yeah here's the
build this is a 6700 K skylight dream
machine here all the parts together and
I'm gonna be going over these just one
at a time but you can see the total
price down here
$9,200
again somewhat reasonable yeah but
anyway alright so first off of course we
have the 6700 K which apparently is very
hard to come by it's still out of stock
in a bunch of places even a new egg
which usually gets lots of allocation
for CPUs it's hard to find so I guess
that might be a difficult to hear is
just getting your hands on a 6700 K in
general but that's kind of the basis so
of course those don't ship with CPU
coolers also I have my I have an i-5
here this is like my example box but
we're actually working with an i7 anyway
so this of course our Hydra series h1 10
I big massive 280 millimeter cooler its
corsair it's got this color scheme thing
so you can change the colors these just
really high rated they do a great job
and I wanted water cooling in this as
much as possible I did briefly debate
doing custom like picking parts for a
custom water cooling loop but I decided
not to for various reasons but
everything's still water-cooled anyway
motherboard is a Maximus 8 extreme
motherboard from Asus which you can get
for four hundred seventy dollars very
expensive motherboard at B&amp;amp;H but they
don't have good pictures so here's the
pictures on Newegg this motherboard is
is it's an ROG motherboard so Asus tends
to do the the kitchen sink with these
and throws all kinds of stuff in there
but after looking at this and even
deciding upon it I realized there was a
little bit there's gonna be a little bit
of controversy here so you guys let me
know in the comments what you think
because Asus this year for the Maximus 8
extreme which is the their highest then
z170 board from what I understand they
didn't do a plx bridge so you can
actually actually only limit it to
two-way SLI here you can do Quad SLI if
you do two dual GPU cards but those
don't even exist for the current
generation yet so yeah I went with a
two-way GPU configuration because of
that there are other boards out there
that are crazier than this in the PCI
Express area with plx bridges and that
take your 16 lanes available on the 6700
K and spread them out and give you more
that doesn't just didn't introduce a bit
of latency though and even without
asking JJ about this I can tell you guys
probably their reasoning was they looked
at
actual use cases and they said you know
people who are buying this platform tend
to not go for more than two maybe three
graphics cards and really if you're
going to go for more than that you
should go for the extreme platformer x99
LGA 2011 - three and you know go go for
that so hey I still stuck with this
board because there's still a crazy
amount of features in here that Asus
asus has wedged in but let me know what
you guys think if for a dream machine
build like this you would go with the
Asus or you maybe you'd pick something
like the Giga bytes
what is it the gaming did yeah whatever
that $500 gigabyte board is that I have
that I don't remember their name up off
the top of my head Hey look new egg has
tech experts that can help no thank you
okay g.skill ripjaws 5-series again this
is a dream machine so a maximum amount
of memory possible 64 gigs four by
sixteen gig kit and I just went with the
fastest I could find pretty much it's
400 this is actually kind of reasonable
for ddr4 considering this these are 16
gig dims but PC 3200 speed I just wanted
fast and I wanted to match though
there's your memory storage storage I'm
a little crazy on you might notice here
I have what is this total 8 terabytes 9
terabytes almost 10 terabytes of SSD in
here I did yes
for anyone mentioning if there's a delay
I'm going to fix it in post I did not
put any mechanical drives in here but
you still have up to 10 or close to 10
terabytes of storage and I tried to use
as much of the i/o connectivity as I
possibly could so let's jump back to
here so first off to fill in your m2
slot goes right to there I got the
Samsung 950 Pro this is an m2 2280 nvme
drive this is super fast it's black and
it will also match with the motherboard
so I like that for extra storage and
also to make use of the built-in UDOT 2
port on that motherboard I chose the
Intel 750 series this is the one that's
linked in the PC part picker thing but
they for some reason don't have the one
link to that I wanted to put which is
this one the 2.5 inch version of this
drive that works with you too so this
one's out of stock I guess but that's
the one I would go for if you go for
this one it's a PCI Express
expansion and it won't I chose to
specifically to go with the u dot too
but again PC part picker doesn't have
that listed finally I chose for Samsung
850 Pro 2 terabytes SATA drives cuz
they're they're that eight hundred and
eighty dollars each but that's a lot of
storage two terabytes and you can you
could put these into a raid
configuration if you wanted to just
connect it natively to the intel PCH IV
loads of fun anyway maybe I go overkill
with storage in some of these builds for
graphics cards I wanted the best of the
best so again let's tighten X 12 gigs
per card is really I think kind of the
selling point here if you're really
trying to justify that thousand dollar
plus price tag and again wanted
everything to be water cooled so EVGA
has got the hybrid version of these now
that's got the included loop with
120-millimeter radiator and two of these
is really all you can fit on the Maximus
eight extreme so that's what I'm with to
that's reasonable right we need a case
to fit everything so we got a fan tax
and thew series this is the end loop
primo it's aluminum it's actually not
that crazy expensive I was looking at
some of the other more expensive cases
from Leanne Lee from in win they have
some good options there but I wanted to
make sure everything would fit in here
without too much difficulty and enthu
primo is definitely a case that gets a
lot of positive feedback for just just
how much how much stuff you can fit into
it it's really pretty insane I don't
know why the new a gig images are
loading but here ah yeah there's tons of
space in here it's also a ATX it will
fit that motherboard it's got space on
the bottom as well as on the back for
your 120 millimeter a tears for those
graphics cards and I think you'll be all
set again not the most expensive case if
you are looking for other options in
cases or if you're just wondering what
else I was considering as far as a
really high in case the cosmos to from
Coolermaster is still a very popular one
and then the 900 d from Corsair is
another one that's kind of right up in
that range there's some others as well
but again I was here and there I was
trying to be reasonable with this build
snow finally we need a power supply so
again I went with Titan
if you're going titanium hi why did you
pretty much got the courser ax 1500 I
there's also the EVGA supernova 1600
watt tough choice between those but this
one is really well reviewed it's just
supposed to be kind of one of the top
power supplies out there also goes with
some of the other Corsair components in
the build if you want the EVGA I think
you'd be fine as well to be perfectly
honest alright so let's move on to the
next build what do you guys think of
that one $9,200 is anyone gonna invest
I'll be honest right here I would not I
would not in any way shape or form by
this system
I just wouldn't because it's it's it's
mainstream it's it's a it's using the
6700 K it's skylake I would do an X 99
build if I was going to spend this much
money but hey some people might do it I
don't know there might be that little
niche of the market who might actually
spend that much money who knows we need
to find those people and and take their
money or something alright let's move on
to the more reasonable one here this is
a $400 aim the APU build icon I'm
calling this in the Minecraft Plus bill
because there's two kind of factors to
this one is that I'm going to be
building this to is it's going to be a
Christmas gift for our nephew and then
three is gonna be what he's doing with
it which is he wants to computer to play
Minecraft and this should be able to do
that without any problems and then he
also is potentially he's still fairly
young but he might in the future want to
like get into the whole pc building
thing so I wanted to build him a system
that you know if he did want to in the
future he could dive in there and add
some stuff and this is an APU system so
it's going to be using the integrated
graphics from the 1878 50k so adding a
graphics card to this in the future if
he like graduates to some higher-end
games or something like that could be a
great option also pro tip for anyone who
was watching my video that I did roughly
at this time of year one year ago I also
did a 78 50 K build and I was looking at
that as I go well we are coming to the
end of this run of processors from AMD I
think both on the APU and the standard
CPU side so yeah next year we're
expected to see more one other thing
about this as I said this was a $400
build and that's because there's a
mail-in rebates on
on what where's the mail and rebate
there's a millinery bet on something and
there's also the fractal power supply
which was $45 yesterday and is now 70
so that jumped up let me show you guys
though how to find a different power
supply if you don't want to use this
fractal one i also have the franklin
power supply already so i i'm gonna use
it but if you guys want something more
reasonably priced if that power supply
doesn't drop again pc part picker over
here in the list just go to choosing a
power supply use the filters on the left
side so all i did was change the wattage
range from 400 to 650 watts which is
about the range i want i want it to be
able to support a discrete graphics card
in the future if it comes to that and
then i also went with 80 plus bronze
which i think is kind of the best bang
for your buck with also an 80 plus rated
power supply and then i sorted by lowest
price and here you can see the corsair
CX 430 builder series power supply which
is insanely popular which was another
very close chance for this and you can
still get that for forty to forty five
dollars whether you want the modular or
non modular there's some other ones in
here see sonic power supplies alike EVGA
he's got some
reels will is generally pretty good just
make sure you check that feedback rating
so lots of options down here and these
say 40 to 50 ish dollar range for power
supplies if the one you were looking for
doesn't isn't on sale anymore so anyway
that's mean just to find this still
being a four hundred dollar bill okay
810 70 50 k kaveri quad-core yes this
processor has been out since last year
but yes it is still a pretty viable
option i think for now especially if
you're looking at something that has
some pretty good graphics performance
but not necessarily it breaks the bank
so 130 dollars for this right now
and this is again one of the fixed items
that i already had to use for the bill
of course I needed a motherboard to go
along with that so asrock has this one
this is an a 70 M chipset motherboard
which isn't the highest end but it can
still do some overclocking it's a nice
little board as far as the future set
goes it's got your USB 3.0 it's got your
video outs there including a couple HDMI
and it's even got some USB 3.0 3.0 and
some of those sort of higher-end
features too
with the connectivity also of course
that expansion slot PCI Express means
that you can add a graphics card in the
future which I want him to be able to do
memory I did a similar search to the one
I just showed you guys with with the
power supply I drilled down to an 8 gig
2 by 4 gig kit and I wanted faster
memory speed so I was looking at 21 33
to 2,400 even higher than that as long
as it stayed reasonably priced that is
how I sellable on this kit from g.skill
it's only $39 on Newegg right now of
course there's a few other options in
the 35 to 45 dollar range that could go
I decided for an SSD I want this to be
very fast
I want it to feel very fast even though
it's using a slightly older apu
processor so SSD is the way to go
if you want to do that and I also wanted
to reasonably reasonable capacity so 240
gigs $65 for this I think is very
reasonable price you could get you could
have gotten these even less if we were
doing this a weekend a week and a half
ago or so during Black Friday sales but
I'm a 60 65 for that still very nice
price of course the fractal design core
500 is is a great little case I have one
here I'm gonna be building in its I've
already done a little bit of b-roll on
it so I can already say nice solid case
fairly inexpensive it's 73 bucks over at
Amazon but on super Buy super B's super
buys I don't know they have it for
cheaper 55 after a promo code but of
course it's out of stock yeah let's have
a cookie crust crumbles or something
like that anyway
lastly power supply and Tegra m4 and 50
watt this is a nice solidly made little
80 plus bronze power supply from fractal
stays pretty quiet I'm actually gonna be
building with the 750 watt version
because again that's what I have but the
450 would do just fine for this little
build and would even have enough juice
to power a graphics card beyond that as
well so hey there you guys have it my
two builds one insanely high-powered and
high priced one much more reasonable and
reasonably priced thanks to all you guys
who have jumped in to chat to say hello
during my little production here my
livestream tell you guys who are
watching on YouTube in the future thanks
so much for watching don't forget to
subscribe to my channel hit the like
button
down in the description again there's
links to these builds there's also links
to my store where you can do stuff like
buy t-shirts that still have mugs I also
have some sales going on for some
hoodies and some shirts and there's also
some new logo stuff so check all that
out because it's it's absolutely
fabulous and there's still time to shop
before thee before Christmas anyway
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next
