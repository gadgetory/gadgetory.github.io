my Tesla Model S speed test but there's
a reason I did that video it's because
the Tesla Model S for kids arrived and
it's this massive box and it's like I
need to do something with this right now
because it's a huge box taking up a lot
of space that said a couple more huge
boxes have arrived
this time from Corsair so I'm going to
open these and show you guys what's
inside
cooler masters SK series mechanical
keyboards help you keep a low profile
with ultra flat double Schottky caps and
a slim minimalist design available in
full size trim as the sk 650 or the even
more portable 10 keyless sk 630 these
keyboards feel great thanks to genuine
Cherry MX low profile mechanical
switches they've also got a durable
brushed aluminum top plate and a
detachable and braided USB type-c cable
so click the sponsor link in the
description for more on the Coolermaster
sk 630 and sk 650 just said i should go
with the long skinny box first before
the short wide box so i usually gets
pretty good advice we're gonna stick
with that this is from corsair and I
already know vaguely what's inside here
it's their hydro X series of open loop
water cooling gear I actually have a mix
of stuff in here because they are
sending some of their existing products
like fans because of course they're
already makes like 90% of the parts in a
computer maybe that's a little good
taking a little bit too far but
everything except like processors
graphics cards and motherboards of
course they're pretty much makes now
they are expanding from just doing all
in one closed-loop liquid coolers like
their existing hydro series to the hydra
x-series of open-loop coolers and they
are going all out with this which means
everything from the liquid coolant
inside to the pumps the blocks the
reservoirs the fittings you can now get
directly from corsair so these are the
parts of course there's actually
designed and manufactured themselves
they're doing a bunch of collaboration
with a lot of the different parts
because there's quite a few established
water cooling parts manufacturers that
are out there and Corsair has sort of
taken on some of their stuff select the
fittings for example I made my bits
power the coolant is done by Mayhem's
the radiators are by Hardware labs and
the blocks and the pumps of course there
has been doing themselves so we have a
couple blocks here XG
seven RGB the blocks that they are
producing for GPUs are going to have a
range of compatibility with higher end
graphics cards because that's really all
you should be bothering to water cool
they're supporting twenty seventy twenty
eighty s and twenty eighty T is when it
comes to in videos are txseries they're
also supporting 1080 T eyes if you look
at the last generation from Nvidia and
then for AMD they're supporting the
Vegas 56 and vegas 64 not sure about the
Radeon seven and then I'm hoping that
they will update to also support the
Navi cards when they come out but we'll
wait and see on those so I have two of
the x g7 RGB GPU blocks I also have two
of the CPU blocks the XC 9 and the XC 7
because they have two different variants
of these @ XC 7 basically is for
mainstream water cooling so it's gonna
fit your Intel LGA 1150 whatever so
pretty much any current generation Intel
mainstream socket that should fit and
then for AMD you have a.m. for
compatibility hooray so you can use
these with horizon first second or third
gen NEX c9 is a Big Daddy so this one's
going to support LGA 2066 as well as AMD
socket thread Ripper TR 4 or the thread
Ripper socket so if you're cooling a
high-end desktop then you'll want the XC
9 and then finally the pump reservoir
combo unit the XD 5 RGB which uses a
lanky v for the pump and then the actual
housing and reservoir are all
manufactured and designed by corsair
uses actually nylon rather than acrylic
for the housing so they say that has
some benefits to it for example you
don't get some of the micro cracks that
you can get if you're using an acrylic
housing then the final piece of this
that Corsair has put together on their
website is a configuration software or
just a web-based configuration utility
because they're trying to sort of open
up the open-loop water cooling market to
people who might have been a little bit
intimidated by it before for that
purpose the online configurator will
allow you to go and choose your case and
then get the parts you need to get all
the pieces to put together a loop like
this
and I think I'm going to try that later
on in this video to sort of see how it
works because it is now available and
you can now use it but let's get into a
little bit more detail by opening up
these things where should I start
so here's what's included with the pump
the xd5 RGB we got an installation
manual and warranty guide we have some
screws these are the little thumb screws
they look pretty nice so having a nice
finish and everything is going to be I
think one of the key points of course
there's trying to hit here because let's
face it if people are doing the extra
lengths to water cool with an open loop
in their system there's probably at
least a little bit of an aesthetic
concern going on apart from just the
improved cooling so having nice fittings
is good for that a couple more screws
here for attaching the pump to these
brackets as well as this extension
bracket here so we have a single bracket
that the pump kind of sits down in that
is the d5 pump down there at the bottom
and then that can then attach to either
of these brackets so you have a hundred
and twenty millimeter for attaching it
to a 120 millimeter mounting point on a
radiator or directly to a fan nine
hundred and forty millimeter and these
are unreal so you can move the pump
assembly up and down to position it
where you need it to go more screws and
washers for mounting the pump to the
bracket mounting the bracket to the case
we also have this little add-on which i
think is pretty nice this is a
temperature sensor so just a little GM
one-quarter plug and then on the inside
you get a temperature sensor so just
going to attach that on an unused gianna
quarter fitting here on the pump itself
or you can put it elsewhere in your loop
if you wanted as long as it's got water
flowing over it then it's going to be
able to tell you the temperature of your
liquid and that's important in a water
cooling loop because you don't usually
want to make sure your liquid stays
below about sixty degrees Celsius you
got some additional plugs for capping
off the ports that you don't use this is
a plug tool which is just basically a
flathead for screwing in or unscrewing
those he's a plastic in case you're
wondering they have included a power
supply end cap for shorting your power
supply so that you can test your custom
loop once it's all set up without
turning on power to your entire system
because when your leak testing you don't
want to have power running to your whole
system you want to make sure you're just
powering the power supply and the water
cooling parts and then finally we have
the pump and reservoir combo unit itself
this is a little bracket this is metal
it's got sort of a darkened chrome
finish so that's nice
as for the pump and reservoir unit
itself one thing I kind of like about
this is well I mean they're going with
nylon and according to Corsair this is a
very premium nylon that they've gone
with instead of acrylic for the actual
housing of the reservoir it does look
clean and clear though there is a
Corsair logo
an array of sort of cross beams in there
that's a baffle to prevent a whirlpool
effect from happening there are multiple
inlets and outlets they are not marked
here but I imagine that would be
indicated in the manual one on this side
two on this side one more on this side
there's only one blank spot on one side
they're mounting points here are
slightly rubberized so that should help
to dampen some of the vibration and
there's an LED array at the top here it
looks like eight addressable LEDs that
are in there as well as two additional
inlets up here and one of them does have
a downspout so you can prevent air from
getting into that if you're going with a
waterfall looks like the coarser logo on
the top here should also shine through
them light up with the LEDs connected
and then this can be daisy chained one
thing I do want to point out when it
comes to the LEDs since they're all
addressable and since this is Corsair
they're all going to need to plug in to
a corsair control unit such as the
commander pro so that is something to
take into consideration this does allow
you to use the Corsair software which is
pretty flexible I've been using it in my
Riptide setup but just something you
should keep in mind if you're planning
on setting up a loop with this hardware
and especially if you want those RGB
effects to work let's take a look at
these CPU blocks next
so here the CPU blocks the xe7 right
here and a black finish and then the XC
9 are they're both RGB here in the
silver finish interesting thing about
these I think is going to be the sort of
a Sutekh ish mounting system or they
have for the brackets here it's got a
honeycomb pattern of pre-applied thermal
paste that's on the bottom but if you've
ever used one of course areas existing
all-in-one liquid coolers but then asa
tech mounts on it these are reminding me
very very much of those so it's just got
a bracket there that's the Insull one
then it comes shipped with but if you
want to swap over to a m4 for example
you just grab this one install it like
so and now you can fit that on an AMD
socket another kind of cool thing about
that mounting method is actually that
you can rotate these so if you wanted
for example to give yourself sort of a
jaunty 45 degree angle by going like
that gives you a little bit more
flexibility as far as how you're
installing the waterblock when it comes
to orientation basically there's 8
different configurations you could put
you could rotate it all the way around
if you wanted to beyond that you've got
your mounting hardware here manuals of
course some very very thin little nylon
spacers and then of course the backplate
which is going to be universal for both
AMD and Intel sockets
you see the liquid flow as well as the
RGB lighting shine through is injection
molded nylon for these pieces again you
have a light-up Corsair logo and there
is a slight variation between these two
this one here is a slightly smaller
cooling plate with sixty micro fins that
the liquid flows across to provide
cooling and then this top piece here in
black is also plastic with this one
whereas with the LGA 2066
and socket thread your perversion you
get an aluminum top piece there so it is
metal and they get a slightly larger
cooling plate here with 70 Micro cooling
fins instead of the sixty that you get
with the XC seven so those are the
premium features for the high-end
desktop version the XC 9 compared to the
XC 7 does seem to have pretty much the
same mounting hardware and then again
pretty much the same reconfiguration
method you have here this is the Intel
socket for LGA 2066 and then for thread
refer they have included this bracket
which you would simply swap out both of
them have a nice sort of dark chrome
finish oh and one last thing to add is
that both of these have 16 addressable
LEDs arrayed in there and again they
still have the courser required
connection system next is the XG 7 RGB
GPU blocks and these are slightly
reconfigurable from Corsair site so this
one here for example is set up for an RT
X 2080 founders Edition this one is set
up for the RT X xx atti founders Edition
they should be very similar otherwise
though let's start with the xx atti and
like I said there's not gonna be a whole
lots difference between these it's just
a matter of changing up the jet plate on
the bottom
I believe along with the block itself we
have some more caps here as well as one
of those cap screwing tools we have a
little product manual they do include a
backplate so that's nice you don't to
buy that separately this is aluminum
here as well as the exterior housing on
the GPU block itself so there's an
internal part here which is actually a
block that covers not just the GPU but
power delivery and memory components as
well so for me you can see this is
basically all nickel plated copper and
then the exterior part that is black is
all aluminum aside from that it's all
some wires here for the addressable RGB
LEDs there's 16 of those and then it's a
CNC milled copper heat plates underneath
this machined acrylic top section
there's also a flow indicator you should
be able to see that spinning while your
loop is up and running so you make sure
you have water flowing through your
graphics card
and you can kind of see there's a sort
of a Dominator Platinum kind of style
I feel like termination here for your
inlets and your outlets and you can of
course go top or bottom for either of
those so again just providing some
flexibility for how you configure your
loop once you have everything set up
again there's a Corsair logo on the side
as well as GeForce r-tx logo and those
thermal pads being pre applied hey
that's nice you know cutting little
thermal pads to size is one of those
sort of tedious tasks for installing a
GPU block and then we also have thermal
paste pre applied under that little
cover as well and here's a quick look at
the back plates got sort of a matte
section the hydro ex logo and the
Corsair sails beneath that and then
brushed aluminum finish then when it
comes to the 2080 basically the
accessories and everything else that is
included is exactly the same and now
I've kind of figured out how they're
doing this so this entire section right
here it can be swapped out depending on
the GPU that they're configuring it with
so the top here is gonna look pretty
much the same and fairly Universal and
they'll swap that out depending on which
GPU they're setting it up for so we have
a slightly different layout here for the
2080 as compared to the 2080 Ti and now
the remainder of the parts and again a
lot of this stuff was done in
collaboration with some other existing
water cooling manufacturers that are on
the market so I will repeat that as we
came to each one but I wanted to get at
least each of these out of the box so we
could take a quick look starting with
the tubing this is acrylic tubing not
ptg course there's not currently
planning to do PE TG this is 10
millimeter inner diameter and 14
millimeter outer diameter and one of
these packs comes with three tubes no
not too much else to say about that
it's PMMA if you wanted a more specific
type of acrylic that's being used of
course there's also doing soft line
tubing so this is a clear PVC 10
millimeter inner diameter 13 millimeter
outer diameter this just provides some
flexibility because there are benefits
to either option I would say the acrylic
is more of an aesthetic choice soft line
tubing can give you a bit more
flexibility yes that's kind of a pun but
it is also more flexible and this will
also allow you to do some maintenance on
your system if it's a bit more easily
that is why the only system that I am
currently running
that's water-cooled that I use on a
regular basis that I'd be very upset if
it didn't work properly is Riptide and
that uses soft tubing as well
quick disconnects so that if I ever had
anything go wrong I could at least get
things reconfigured to have the system
up and running and I wouldn't have too
much downtime that said we have a bunch
of different fittings and adapters here
so I'll open those up and show you a few
of those but before that here is their
liquid this is called xl5 and they have
sent me the clear liquid the coolants
they're actually working with Mayhem's
and mayhem says a lot of experience
doing coolant it's going to be available
in green red blue purple and this clear
and then they might add pastels in the
future depending on the response and how
many they sell basically is where that
comes from
Corsair says the coolant works with
copper brass and nickel and has advanced
non-toxic anti corrosion inhibitors as
well as anti bacterial growth
suppressors so you should be able to use
this cool it without adding anything
else and you won't have any any icky
stuff growing in your loop or corrosion
of course versions bed just make sure
you're not including any aluminum parts
in your loop the touch water because
mixed metals is bad radiators I almost
forgot the radiators these are actually
being done in collaboration with
hardware labs and they say they're gonna
have a pretty wide range of these
available they sent me the XR five of
the card app called XR 5 is simply the
240 millimeter and 360 millimetre
accessory-wise they've set you up with
enough screws to do a push-pull
configuration or a push or pull with
short screws on the other side for
mounting to the case and this looks to
be a pretty standard looking radiator
does have sort of a matte paint finish
on the outside which i think looks
pretty nice of course there are logos of
course I'm gonna say medium fin density
here it's not looking too dense but not
too loose either such should give you a
balance between airflow and actual heat
dissipation got two G and a quarter
fittings on the ends for inlet and
outlets and then a pretty standard 240
millimeter layout this one obviously has
a black finish no note on whether
Corsair is going to do any other colors
for these I would I would think maybe
they'll do a white line up at some point
but again that's gonna probably depend
on the popularity of these parts when
they actually hit the market and regular
sizes and thicknesses should be
available so 120 millimeters should go
all the way up to 480 millimeter or 4 by
120 or all the way down to single 120
and then 440 millimeter rads that'll go
up to 420 millimeters so 3 by 142 by 140
or 1 by 140 should
be available and here's the 360
millimeter variance which is one longer
isn't it
here are the fittings and adapters that
Corsair sent over for hard line tubing
they have these low-profile ones these
comes in packs of four they also have 90
degree adapter fittings here which are
nice to have if you're working in a
narrow space they these come in packs of
two these are all gonna have the chrome
finish by the way but the fittings will
be available in black silver white or
polished brass again more might be
available depending on market reception
these are adapters so we got some
45-degree rotary adapters and some
90-degree Rodya adapters these come in
packs of two we have a ball valve that
you could use for a drain or something
like that we have a fill porch that you
could install into a case single packs
of those we have a Wye splitter adapter
just a single pack of that as well then
the compression fittings over here for
soft tubing these come in packs of four
and here's a quick look at our fittings
and adapters and I will say that I could
not agree more with Corsairs decision to
partner with bit's power for these
because bit's power in my experience
makes really good fittings and adapters
that you can just tell by sort of the
tightness with which these rotary
fittings actually go together so these
are the chrome ones and you might notice
that Corsair has fairly limited branding
this one actually has the Corsair logo
on a couple sides it's just a little Y
adapter here's a fill port as well and
again I can just kind of tell by how
smooth the threading is and nice type
fitting with the o-rings there as well
but that's just pretty simple fill port
here is the ball valve
of course our logo on the side there
there's a bit more room there so they
were able to display that all the way
just give it a twist closes it off twist
it that way opens it back up here's a
compression fitting you can see the
barbs on this side and this is for the
soft tubing this one has sort of the
rough textured area around the outside
so that's helpful for gripping here are
our angled adaptors and I've used quite
a few of these from bits power and I
actually love that these do not have
logos on them when I've used bits power
fittings in the past I've sometimes felt
like man there's a bits power logo
everywhere so now you can kind of like
get bits power fittings which can be a
little bit harder to come across in the
US without bits power logos on them and
just buy them directly from Corsair with
corsair warranty and support and
everything I just attached these two
together there's a 90 degree and a 45
degree then finally we have our hardline
fittings here and these
are for the 14 millimeter outer diameter
and I like how low-profile these are
because that can be a challenge with
hard line tubing is getting the right
length and depending on how you're doing
your measurements and everything
sometimes having a low profile fitting
that's already on there can give you a
little bit better idea of how to line
things up and measure it appropriately
as you can see a ring goes on there and
then you got the cap that fits on the
top of course your compression tubing
would go in there as well
so it is nice that they're able to keep
these as low-profile and small as they
are then here's the 90 degree adapter
for the hard-line tubing and this
basically has fittings on both sides so
if you're doing a build that you're not
doing a bunch of bends in your hardline
tubing and you're doing the fittings for
doing the 90 degree angles everywhere
these are actually pretty handy for that
because you've got the fittings on both
ends whereas sometimes you have to use
like an adapter and then a fitting on
the end of the adapter and in that case
you're paying money for the adapter as
well as the fitting on the end so that
might be I don't know maybe slightly
more cost effective depending on the
type of build you're doing so if you're
looking at all this and you're like hey
that sounds good sign me up or if you
just want to see how much it would cost
because hi big boy you're such a special
boy you are so if you're looking at all
this and you're like hey that sounds
great sign me up or if you just want to
speculate and see how much it would cost
for you
Corsair has a configuration utility over
in their website I will link it down in
the description and I'm just going to go
through with the stuff that I have here
and see how much it all would cost of
course you got to start by choosing your
case and I'll be honest I originally
thought hey course there's just gonna
have Corsair cases to choose from but
they also have other brands too so good
on you of course therefore not forcing
people to just use your cases and just
as a proof of concept I'm going to use
the fantex and to evolve X I guess the
configurator will actually show you your
system once you've set it up but it only
does that with the Corsair cases not
third-party cases so in order to show
that I guess I'm going to go back and
choose a Corsair case I'm just gonna go
up to 570 X because it's it's very clear
and there's lots of stuff in there and
I'm really just gonna choose very
quickly different things so after
choosing your case motherboard CPU and
graphics card they automatically set you
up with what they think is an ideal
configuration so let's see what their
recommended setup is for the waterblock
here we have the X c7 that's
too surprising for the GPU block we have
the XG 7 not surprising either cooling
performance ah we have a 360 millimetre
radiator in the front we also have some
options for a 240 or let's do do a
radiator we got a 120 in the back as
well hey this thing actually seems
pretty smart
it's deducting the number of fans that
the case comes with and only giving you
more fans to fill everything else out of
course they're sent me these ml ones
though so I guess I better choose those
I'm style the one that they have will
choose that here's where we choose
between soft and hard tubing they have
sent me both I'm gonna choose the hard
tubing though because that's probably
what I'll build with and they sent me
the 1014 stuff so we'll choose that as
well
clear coolant and chrome fittings is
what I have so let's go ahead with that
we do need something to connect up all
of our RGB stuff they sent me a
commander Pro so look the fan pack
already has IQ integration so that's not
been included I can add more controllers
on though such as a commander Pro oh and
a lot of course there are cases come
with control hubs as well so that's nice
and then it looks like they also kick
you out with kind of the basic number of
fittings that they think you will need
in order to set up your loop including
the hardline tubing the XL 5 coolant
that's also included and then you've got
some four packs of compression fittings
as well as some rotary adapters could
add some 45 degrees as well if I wanted
to and I do have some of those I'll add
one on and there we go this is my
configuration 880 dollars is what it's
going to cost me which might be a
bargain if you do a lot of liquid
cooling stuff or it might be very
expensive if you're comparing it to the
cost of like all-in-one loops or air
coolers for example but water block is
75 bucks GPU block is 150 these two
radiators together 115 the fans are very
expensive that's adding a hundred and
forty so cutting down on those would
definitely cut down on the price the
pump and reservoir combo unit is one
hundred and fifty five dollars all of my
fittings and whatnot are about 120 my
fittings tubing and liquid is about a
hundred and twenty bucks
it's another 70 for the commander Pro
and then another sixty or so for the
addition of some adapters I did find the
fill bubble you can add that on for
$2.99 so I haven't tested this out too
much by throwing extra stuff in there
but it seems like a pretty well
thought-out and easy-to-use online
utility for figure
what you need to go in your liquid
cooling setup but that is gonna wrap it
up for this video though guys I am going
to be doing a build with this stuff
although I still I'm not a hundred
percent sure of all the rest of the
parts I'm gonna put in there obviously I
should be using an RT X 2080 or 2080 TI
in order to use the GPU blocks that I
have I got a wide range of choices when
it comes to CPUs let me know in the
comment section down below what type of
system you think I should be putting
together you guys want intel or AMD and
I will do my very best to accommodate
what you request no promises though of
course thank you so much for watching
