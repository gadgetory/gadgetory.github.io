fixture over let's just find a breathing
hmm excellent pure power here's a good
boy good boy
eros alright should we should be live
good boy about now so that's it's
probably about time to introduce the
show yes hello everyone welcome to our
live show this is awesome hardware
episode number 141 there's actually the
second half of episode 141 so 141 a was
already streams for about an hour give
or take on Kyle's channel bitch so link
to that is in the description if you
missed it if you're watching live thanks
for joining us thanks for being here I
just gave them both of my dogs street
dental treats so you might hear them
chomping away down there doing it and
but this is a live stream about
technology computers and that kind of
thing we remember Tuesday evening at
5:30 p.m. Pacific to twitch TV / awesome
hardware we were streaming the whole
thing and then we stream half to each of
our YouTube channels again this is the
second half of 141 on my channel Paul's
hardware thank you to all of you who
have helped support our channels over
the years and if you'd like to continue
to do so and want to get yourself some
merchandise check out our stores falls
on right at net is mine just added some
new stuff including metallic silver it's
like shiny it's like kind of shiny
printing this memory and there's these
lightweight
hoodies so these these hoodies are
lightweight so they kind of like I can't
like a heavy t-shirt as far as the
fabric goes yeah we add a demo sent over
here so they're not as warm but if
you're looking for something for spring
or summer or something like that or
depending where you live check them out
they're pretty nice also got the
metallic silver on normal t-shirts as
well as all the other merch that has
been available for some time so check it
out also over on Kyle's store bit wet
tech slash store you can find also very
very nice merchandise so if you buy
stuff during the show we will shout out
your name
Johnson to you at the end of the show
thanks Stella guys who have done that
also our brief warning to any of you
guys who might be to adult language we
drink a beer and occasionally use adult
language on the show so it's meant for
people who are old enough to be
responsible with drinking and old enough
to be mature about things are discussing
and appreciate it dogs dogs barking wow
that's actually really good timing for
the through the dental treats cuz that
totally it was there eating dental
treats that's why they didn't freak out
it was I somehow time that perfectly Wow
yeah I did call you like two minutes
before she rolls in my Gary yeah and be
like hey if you send out the Gentiles
because usually what my wife rides home
the dogs go go barking after the dorset
wow that worked it's like in zombie
movies when they like just there like
you know dead piece of flesh out yeah
and the zombies are totally distracted
they don't even like pay him any mind or
anything that's you just my dog very
similar to flesh-eating zombies like
humans are better yep they're smarter
okay moving on
whoa sorry whoa oh here oh no whoa whoa
it always makes me nervous when I see
him charge he was fast it's like oh my
god that's a lot of force just coming
towards you
here is a he's about a hundred pounds
now he's actually over a hundred pounds
now he's his pit bull Mastiffs he's just
pure muscle as he says he just appear
much like someone just extracted you
know Arnold Schwarzenegger zaps he and
turned it into a dog he's got a big old
dome like his head is just massive and a
helmet he's an American he can be
intimidating when he comes running along
at you all right let's see this is wrong
let's just totally wrong I gotta change
this oh there's oh what's their first
something out and a big fucking nowhere
there goes our first segment for today's
cryptocurrency and we're gonna talk
about cryptocurrency just a little bit
and the first story is from the verge
all the stories we're talking about
today by the way are linked in the video
description down below so check it out
if you want to read more coinbase though
which is a very popular and oft used
crypto currency trading websites and
repository has told 13,000 users that
their data will be sent to the IRS soon
so if you are a coin base member or user
then you might already be aware of this
but it's actually goes back to in
November 2016 court order from the IRS
originated from the IRS which has handed
up to 13,000 customers or basically
directed the heiress or directed coin
base to give the IRS 13,000 customers
data and it will be complied with
according to this article within 21 days
this article was posted yesterday so 20
days left
I suppose anyone who bought Bitcoin or
more specifically completed transactions
totaling more than 20 thousand dollars
through their accounts in a single year
so twenty thousand dollars worth of
transactions within a single year
qualifies you for a frequent enough user
of coin base to have been reported to
the IRS through this court order again
the dates are from 2013 to 2015 and
they're specifically the IRS looking
after are looking for people who are
evading cryptocurrency taxes because
depending on like how much money you've
made from cryptocurrency and when it
happens and whether you bought crypto
and then it increased in value once
you've sold it or whether you mined it
there's different tax requirements for
claiming that money that you made
because if you made money then you're
supposed to tell the IRS you made that
money and possibly pay taxes on it if
you
in the US right of course if you are not
sure about this and you're like maybe I
did use that
well first off if you if you use
coinbase you should have got an email by
now they've emailed people just recently
letting them know that they will be
sending their information to the IRS and
if they do that then you're probably
gonna want to make sure that you've
claimed any money you've made through
coinbase
or I mean you should claim money that
you make in general you should right go
by the laws that the IRS has for paying
taxes and stuff and but what I wanted to
say was the article link to the
description has a link down bottom which
is talking about in 2018 it seems like
there's more of a push for this because
Krypto has become more popular but this
link where it says it's a good time to
be extra careful about compliance goes
to a secondary article on the verge
about how to file your income taxes on
Bitcoin in 2018 and this is a little bit
more data about documenting stuff and
where to report Bitcoin income and and
you know how you actually got it
depending how is it how its tax
depending on the source of the of the
profit and that kind of thing so right
there's like there needs to be a lot of
update videos now to all of the how long
does it take to make your money back or
you know gain a profit from from Bitcoin
from from crypto mining I feel like a
lot of those videos are not taking taxes
into account that's true so that's
that's interesting yeah I mean hey it's
money should be taxed yeah something
akin to capital gains tax for in some
situations but again it depends on how
you made money from cryptocurrency
mm-hmm and more details on that article
all right John petty research has just
as of yesterday posted a report on q4 as
well as some numbers on 2017 jpr does
analysis of technology and
market sales that kind of thing excuse
me
year to date I'm sorry you two-year
total GPS chip mints decreased 4.8% so
4.8% down graphics card sales desktop
graphics are down 2% 2% notebook
graphics sales down 7% well what do you
think of that Kyle I'm kind of not
surprised at all by the desktop graphics
little dip and desktop more so in
notebooks well that's that also not
surprising but it is interesting to see
that notebooks have decreased but I feel
like it's it's sort of like acclimated
like we've kind of plateaued where
everyone's got a freaking notebook at
this point and there haven't been any
huge strides in notebook knowledge if
you're looking at a market place where
the the available graphics like the the
mobile graphics the graphics cards that
you might get in a notebook that would
have a discrete graphics card in it have
been out for a while so you're looking
at maybe a little bit of saturation to
some degree where people who might have
invested in a gaming laptop maybe
they're already satisfied with what they
have because there hasn't been any major
advancements or launches right in that
space so that's maybe switch also means
that vendors aren't advertising their
older products as much you know me like
their marketing spend is probably not as
high now when they're on the tail end of
the the current generation of technology
that they're on and they're probably
gearing up for the next wave and they're
gonna push that even harder so I feel
like maybe they're just not you know but
also might have something to do with it
the fact that we're not being marketed
these newer current gen CPUs and GPUs
that have been out for a year or more
now so that's possibly it's not too
surprising I think we're just kind of in
a lull overall PC market desktop market
desktop or mobile
we're coming a little in-between this
sort of you know transitionary period
between generations if there's a lull in
desktop sales it might be expected to
continue this year but more on that in a
minute
to bring this back around to why we're
including this in the cryptocurrency
section there's a article on wucf tech
about the jpr article which has a little
bit more analysis son did this article
and 3 million graphics cards is I found
this interesting in the jpr article and
I tried to redo this to find see if
there is any indication as to how they
determine this but they're very
specifically say over 3 million add-in
boards were sold to cryptocurrency
miners worth seven hundred and seventy
six million dollars in 2017
AMD was a primary benefactor of these
sales they have some numbers to back it
up here I don't know how they determine
that a GPU that was sold was sold
specifically to a cryptocurrency miner
I'm not sure how they're saying how they
they're separating that I mean I thought
the article might have something it
didn't seem to specify that I I mean Jay
Baer is pretty well respected so I have
to assume it's true but I just I'd be
interested to see how they determined
that this sale went to a crypto minor
versus the sale that went to maybe
anyone buying over two GPUs at a time
yeah they might be looking at sales that
kind of thing
maybe companies that are selling
directors yeah it's hard to say because
I feel like most people most miners or
most people who were into mining who
were trying to get their foot in the
mining wouldn't just buy one or two gee
maybe two but wouldn't just buy one GPU
if they're going through all that
trouble they're probably trying to rack
up you know a couple of graphics cards
to get the highest hashed rate or
whatever it is when I well they're
figuring you know well now it's a Fry's
a week we could to ago and that's
walking in the dude was walking out did
I mention this last week I feel I could
I didn't I don't think so dude was
walking out with a shopping cart with a
bunch of graphics cards in it and I
looked he punched him in the face that
one over here and I punched him know I
had in the balls
I know like it first does kind of like
bemused by it
right
and I've looked at it I didn't like go
up close to it but I'm pretty sure there
were 10 70s I'm pretty sure swanky they
were GTX 10 70s in it but then we went
in because we were going in to buy a
computer case but I wanted to look at
the graphics cards just to see like you
know empty shelves or if they had
anything or whatever and there's nothing
never certainly no 10 70s or 10 70 TI's
so I was like how did that guy just walk
out with the shopping cart full right 10
70s maybe and my mind started going with
speculation of like did he somehow know
when they were gonna get a shipment in
maybe was he just lucky to be there and
be like oh my gosh they actually have
these in stock they were selling for
well over MSRP that 10 70s that were
that had the stickers there
we're selling I think for seven or eight
hundred bucks each so he certainly
bought them at that price but that's yes
15 there were probably somewhere but
like eight or eight or ten I mean it was
definitely a stack of graphics cards a
minute
the only other GPUs that were in stock
were 10 30s that were there anyway
moving on though there is there was a
couple of things I was gonna mention
about this Andy market share has
increased when it comes to GPUs in q3
was at 13% and keep for q4 jumped up to
14.2%
which is an eight point one percent
increase so despite the like I don't
feel like many gamers have actually got
their hands on like a Vega 56 or Vega 64
but according to this market share has
increased for them there was one like
little tidbit in here that I felt like
it was kind of a kind of a bit of hope
perhaps a quote from the article that
said we expect demand to slacken from
the minors as margins drop in response
to increasing utility costs and supply
and demand forces to drive up AME prices
so that's specifically saying is
increasing utility costs I don't know
how much that mean better well how much
like the you if you're mining then
that's using up electricity and your
electricity has to come from somewhere
so you wanna get a utility utility bills
that but then there's also the like
mining difficulty that increases over
time depending on what what
cryptocurrency you're talking about and
that kind of thing so I'm not sure thing
so they don't mean like you know that
the rates for electricity are going up
they just mean if you start mining
you'll be paying more for your
electricity bill every month which I
think most miners understand yeah
already yeah we get it we know we're
gonna be paying more for electricity
every month so I don't know how that's
like that's gonna motive like cause
people to stop mining I don't it's not
just that's like common knowledge it
just comes with the territory that I'm
gonna pay more for my electricity yes if
like if I were to look forward to
domains lacking for graphics cards from
miners it would probably be because
difficulty of mining is it goes up over
time so if you're not making as much
money from the graphics cards that you
have employed in your mining rig then
you're interested in buying more is
probably gonna wait yeah and at a
certain point you might reach a
threshold where you start reducing the
number of cards you're mining with if it
doesn't make sense when it comes to how
much you're paying for your utility
costs but there's also this possibility
of like other like new crypto currencies
come about all the time right mm-hmm
like aetherium obviously is one of the
most popular or most effective
currencies that's mined with graphics
cards right now but new cryptocurrency
has come about that gained in popularity
and value might suddenly introduce a new
you know a difference Avenue to direct
your your mining power down the
use wrong term if you can switch over to
a different cryptocurrency that suddenly
you're mining power is more effective at
than you know you're not mm-hmm you're
not suffering that drop off yeah I guess
as menacing more efficient for your your
sign up or whatever yes okay I got you
anyway point being lots of graphics
cards were purchased by cryptocurrency
miners in 2017 and this article is a bit
of direct proof of that
probably is a lot of us assume that
anyway given current prices and whatnot
right if you were not into
cryptocurrency mining at all you might
still have done some crypto mining and
that might have just happened by going
to a website that has a bad service that
has an ad that gets fed that gets served
to you that loads up say Java Script or
something that initiates a mining on
your CPU using your extra CPU cycles
this has been happening for a little
while now and it's become more prevalent
but in some ways also actually if you go
all the way to the bottom of this
article they have a little bit I found
this interesting like how much do people
actually make from having a website with
ads to get served on it that do crypto
mining and there is a follow-up post on
ARS technica that is linked here from
back in September where they did a very
small site experimenting with binding
and a thousand visits per day and a 55
second average and the site made 36
cents per day which was four to five
times less than it made running regular
ads so obviously it's probably no
depends on your traffic and everything
whether it would make sense for you to
even engage in this type of activity if
you were the you know if you run a
website or something like that but
there's so many the point is the limit
yeah and for most for most of us I
personally get kind of irritated at
something like this like I don't want
some random website I go to to suddenly
have access to the hardware capabilities
of
the system that I felt right like right
and I certainly don't want suddenly it
to be using more power that I have to
pay for exactly to mine for somebody
else like that's a pretty crappy - so
yeah obviously this among other crappy
advertising techniques is the reason why
ad blockers have become very popular we
use ad blockers as we're showing you
guys a lot of the websites that we
visits during the live show primarily to
prevent any sort of redirects ads that
kind of thing from popping up
however we are at least I could say I
and I think catalyst - if you go to a
website commonly or a YouTube channel or
something like that remember that a lot
of the Internet is still ad supported a
lot of the free content that's available
in the Internet still relies on ads so
whitelisting is something that you can
do to give a little bit back to the
websites and content sources that you go
to without hopefully making yourself
susceptible to this type of thing anyway
yeah before I move on and I think we
should open these beers second wind here
we come oh these are so good these beers
are so good dessert this is left hand
brewing left hand very a little stout
nitro um I picked these up a total wine
the other day gotta get that bottle up I
didn't open your cell just look at the
bottle while you drink
these are nitrogen I'd never had a
bottled nitro before until this but
they're delicious
Cheers been working on our praying
techniques yep really good at pouring
now
satisfying and that's how you pour beer
that's how you should pour every beer
every beer pour that way
no these specifically are meant to be
poured hard means straight down that's a
hard pour just to it engage that nitro
effect and you can sort of see it it's
perfectly fine it's doing its thing
giving us a nice level it's headed there
I'm sure a lot of you guys freaked out
right there but after that everything's
cool after that I had was that last week
or the yeah yeah occasionally we have we
have a challenging time pouring beer on
the show but anyway let's move on oh
yeah cheers Cheers guys so if a website
that you're visiting is using your CPU
to mine while you browse that sucks and
you might employ an ad blocker to
prevent it's however some miners are
employing a trick to to circumvent that
and it was actually first popularized by
botnet software to bypass ad blocking
basically it's using domain name
algorithms which is software derived
means for creating a nearly unlimited
number of unique domain names ab
blockers often rely on blocking an ad
source domain but this circumvent set by
creating a virtually unlimited number of
randomly created domains that the ad can
then source that that can be sourced
from which might not be blacks are
listed in the list of blocked domains by
your ad blocker the research reference
in the article was done by net lab 360
researcher zhang zifang who said that
some of these domain name algorithm
based crypto mining ads have been in
operation since mid-2017 he said the
number of people being redirected to the
algorithmically generated domains
appears to be significant one don't
domain which is basically a bunch of
random letters com was number 1999 in
the Alexa website ranking so
to get within the top two thousand
websites visited by Alex s simply by
being a randomly redirected ad probably
being served to who knows what websites
the algorithmically generated domain
eventually calls coin coin hive calm
coin I'm calm and depending on what
software you're using it may or may not
actually be able to block that they
specifically quote from Jerome Segura
who's the lead malware analyst from for
malwarebytes I've used malwarebytes
before I think it's pretty solid
software he said from malwarebytes users
it doesn't matter because we can block
either the ad network or the coin hive
call so either way they're able to block
it but in any case there's a little bit
more detail in the article if you guys
want to go into it like I said it
follows up with some of the stuff like
how much how much how much for people
who are engaging in this activity
actually profiting in it yeah doesn't
necessarily seem like it's that much
simply because people don't necessarily
sit on websites that long right but
obviously people are trying it and it
does seem to be unethical at best so
it's certainly something that's people
should be aware of trying to block oh
god this is what you sound like Paul how
did that even clicking oh it did that
again your your rocket into my own of
them that's not the time that's the onus
jo-jo so Joey is this mouse befriend he
has the rocket software and he like
reprograms everything so now like I was
using this bus and I had one I had one
profile set up on it that it just always
used and it was like fine and that has
like and now are the cards and now all
15 buttons open up pornhub like just no
matter what you do left and right
clarity but just open up pornhub but
there's certain times it's like they're
deeply I can tell cuz the color changed
like I did I scrolled the mouse the I
spelled the wheel and it changed the
volume what that's what that's what just
happened Wow
from you to I feel like I usually need
scroll way more than I need
that still did it especially because I
have a volume knob on my keyboard what
so that just instantly takes your volume
to 100 or just unmutes what's going on
yeah it still it still it still volume
you just scroll all the way down weird
how does he scroll then that drives me
crazy how does he scroll that's how does
it Joe it seems a scroll
it's like if I accidentally hit the
profile change button it messes with
everything next time oh I'm over at
Joe's is basically next time of Joe's
has my goes webpage all right now scroll
down I just want to see what it does
basically arrow keys alright let's move
on here for net watch wait no we're not
to now watch it wait now we're it now
watch mints
damn it what are we doing that watch
ready to go ATG it's all good watch is
Antoinette watch he Scrolls just wait
while the or the hard drive wakes up
that has the image stored on it there it
is net watch all righty
time for net watch where we talk about
the internet and stuff so first off net
neutrality we've talked a lot about the
fight for it in the u.s. that's gone on
over the past amount of time and stuff
and late 2017 the we lost and and and
the FCC was like hey we don't care what
anyone says we're gonna give it a net
neutrality so um lots of internet
service providers when this happened or
when the debate was ongoing about it
made some pretty you know like publicly
flowery statements such as AT&amp;amp;T CEO
Randall Stephenson saying last year we
don't block websites we don't censor
online contents and we don't throttle
discriminate or degrade network
performance based on content
just based on money and they they then
they're there Twitter tweeted stuff like
that and all that kind of stuff but um
just show everyone that's that was all I
was all bullshit basically and that
pretty quickly within a relatively short
period of time afterwards they're going
to actually start doing things that
violate net neutrality or net neutrality
actually is AT&amp;amp;T has started to rollouts
internet fast lanes in the form of zero
rated content so on Friday just this
last week four days ago eighteen T sent
texts of customers explaining how they
are expanding their sponsored data
program to allow other companies to
sponsor data sponsored data plans mean
that the companies pay AT&amp;amp;T to have
their content streamed up to 18 T
customers devices without hitting
against their data plans right now
though there's only three services using
18 T sponsored data program those happen
to be
DirecTV u-verse and fullscreen which are
all services that are owned by AT&amp;amp;T so
when it comes to discriminating against
contents pretty much the base definition
of that if some content that you can
access via your data plan on your cell
phone or whatever you have it counts
against your data cap and others does
not that's discrimination discriminating
against and the content there so whereas
zero-rating has maintained some
popularity and there's different ways to
implement it this mess is just freaking
out I just could kill them out what's
wrong with it
this is this certainly is is a violation
of that an AT&amp;amp;T proving pretty quickly
that they do intend to have to have
recites and David Street sites and data
differently yes
attempts to connects too much to
download or that's really fuckin shitty
yeah Wow now does this apply to home
Internet or is this already only talking
about mobile here oh wow this mouse is
terrible now your knit and I need to
read is dying hey missus can you hand me
the yogi and 565 oh yeah that works
this specimen I like this mess
are you - of course sir I'm 65 everyone
was I talking about neutrality
neutrality there are two major
consequences to this one is that the FTC
no no no I scroll down I'm on the next
arrabal all right no that's all I had to
say about that
and ATT is is already starting to do a
prioritized service for certain data
that you might access oh all right
aren't we still waiting on like lawsuits
to follow through like on people suing
like yes we're degree neutrality hasn't
officially died yet that's it
well actually just a few days ago in a
neutrality the like sozin was at
November late November early December
when the FCC actually made their
decision it was actually applied like
two or three days ago or for within the
past week mm-hmm but there's a 60-day
period right now where there's a chance
for a review - possibly
mm-hmm it could possibly be reversed by
congressional review so does that mean
within these next 60 days net neutrality
is dead but it could potentially come
back yeah but you're getting we're
getting ahead of ourselves okay before
we talk about that let's talk
this AT&amp;amp;T has lost a years-long quest to
cripple FTC authority over telecoms and
this story I wanted to talk about a
little bit because there's some new
aughts to this there are two sides to it
and whereas you might at first read this
story and read that the FTC is very
properly holding a teen teen accountable
for what they did several years back
they promised unlimited data to wireless
customers they had contracts that said
you get unlimited data you wireless
customers it was however shit once those
wireless customers to cross to certain
thresholds which was not disclosed to
them 18t throttled their speeds by as
much as 90% so when you're told like hey
this plan that you're signing up for has
unlimited data or whatever and then
unbeknownst to you there is some
threshold that you can cross where
suddenly your data speeds go to crap
yeah that's kind of crappy AT&amp;amp;T has been
fighting this for a while they claimed
that the FTC has no jurisdiction over
the company because the FTC is
specifically barred from regulating
common carriers this is also known an
interesting case because it initially
started in 2014 which which was before
the FCC started classified Internet
service providers is coming in carriers
in 2015 from 2015 to 2017 they're common
carriers title two now they've been
switching back to side one and net
neutrality is in effect so this it kind
of straddles that on both sides which I
don't know how much that affects the
actual decision-making going on but US
law does prevent the FCC from regulating
common carriers the FTC yes I'm sorry
the FTC Federal Trade Commission but the
immunity from FTC regulations applies
only to the extent that a common carrier
was engaging in common carrier services
so as I was starting to say before there
are two major consequences to this
the first is that the FTC's lot to
lawsuit against AT&amp;amp;T can proceed
so the FTC is holding AT&amp;amp;T accountable
for what they said they do for customers
in this case which is good that
potentially allows the FTC to get
refunds for AT&amp;amp;T customers whose mobile
internet plans were startled so if you
were one of those customers and you know
maybe you'll get a refund or credit or
something like that we'll see how that
goes
second part though is that this decision
affirms the FTC's authority to regulate
broadband providers even when those
providers offer separate common carrier
services such as landline or mobile
phone service so AT&amp;amp;T provides some
services that are classified as common
carriers such as a direct phone service
to your house they are also providing
service that is not classified as common
carrier right such as a AMT you know
solar cell phone plan and that kind of
thing or an amendment or an internet
plan yeah so because they straddle both
this affirms that the FCC can regulate
them within that nation or that's able
to regulate however before anyone gets
too happy about the FCC to doing their
job here please bear in mind that FCC
Chairman Ajit PI you're probably
familiar with you watch the show
applauded this court ruling which might
make you think twice about it depending
on your opinions of Pi what he said
about this is kind of deceptive though
what he said is that what what he wants
what a G PI has said before when when it
comes to the FCC and then being like hey
we don't need to have rules that keep
Internet service providers from
enforcing that neutrality
we'll just believe that to that you know
look to let the market handle that they
would say that the FTC is in a position
to do something about this however the
FTC is more of a as
the way that they're structured they
don't have any specific net neutrality
rules the FTC does not have any
guidelines that say here's how these
Internet service providers should act
what the FTC the FTC can do is if the
internet service provider promises you
something if they say that we're gonna
give you this unlimited internet and
we're not gonna throttle you or they
provide a contract to you that says net
neutrality is very important to us and
we're always going to uphold it or
whatever then the FTC has the authority
to enforce it after the fact and please
bear in mind this is coming through
right now when the actual transgressions
occurred in 2014 three four years ago so
right you're talking about enforcing
after the fact versus creating rules
that prevent something from happening
right in the first place yeah yes so FTC
can't force the ice piece to behave a
certain way that can only make sure that
they keep true to their promises of
whatever the fuck they want if they made
those promise if they made those
promises right which right now and
they're signing the contract they may or
may not make those promises and the
contractor that'll make sense like that
so this is why if you're reading
something that says all right this shows
that the FTC should be able to handle
net neutrality that's not true right
the FTC should be able to hold companies
accountable for promising customers or
something and they're not following
through on it but obviously this yeah
yeah anyway I was gonna say some
poignant closing statement there but the
FTC is like a parole officer they can't
really force you to not do bad shit they
can only check up on you and and try to
see if you were keeping your promises
but there's no way for them to actually
enforce it that'd be like you're like
your wife your wife would be the one I
don't know where I'm going I've decided
not to scrutinize your analogy nope
you're right and just nod
this
so I feel best yeah okay let the
internet decide moving on though today
was classified as a net neutrality day
of action and if you are on the social
medias at all or Twitter you might have
seen some hashtags going around fro for
net neutrality day of action if you're
not familiar with what exactly people
were talking about there's a little bit
more detail on that now this article
from Gizmodo is just right in the title
talking about democrats unveiling a plan
to save net neutrality or make
republicans look bad while trying i want
to take a moment to reset
i I wish net neutrality wasn't being
divided on party lines because honestly
it doesn't my feel like there's some
fundamental like like principles that
Republicans like tend to cherish that
that fall in line with like what net
neutrality is like that makes sense to
me so it doesn't I don't understand why
it needs to be divided it seems to be
the Republican side of of Congress and
the Senate that seems to be so anti net
neutrality money that said that said
money is the answer you know we can we
can at least look at what's going on
right now when it comes to practically
speaking what the outcome is going to be
so as mentioned just recently the FCC
actually engaged they like it there's
always multiple steps to this type of
thing but they basically hit the Go
button on the restoring Internet freedom
order which was their name for the thing
that they did to kill net neutrality
they call it restoring Internet freedom
because they like to name things things
that are completely opposite of what
they actually do what happened today was
a bunch of Democratic lawmakers formally
introduced legislation to say of net
neutrality via a resolution that would
reverse the restoring Internet freedom
order and they're doing this through
what's called the congressional review
act the CRA this allows Congress to
overturn agency regulations from
agencies such as the FCC in order to do
this they need 51 votes in the Senate
right now they have 50 so they're
looking for one more senator one more
Republican senator specifically to
decide that net neutrality is more
important than following their party
line and to you to join up with people
who are trying to save net neutrality
all 49 members of the Democratic caucus
which includes two independents as well
as Maine Republican senator Susan
Collins are part of this group who is
pushing to use the Congressional review
act to overturn the restoring Internet
freedom order but all things said and
all things considered this is probably
mostly something that's more of an
active more of a statement than
something that's actually going to get
anything done because it would need to
go through the Senate as well as the
house and in the house they still need
something like 100 members of the House
to to change their mind there because
and the house there's a lot more there's
a lot more more House members of the
house and their members
senators everyone knows how the US
government works right okay also I do
even assuming it did get passed the
house Trump would need to also sign its
and not veto it and who knows what he
would decide to do there so chances are
this as it's being put forth right now
won't go through but it does mean that
people are still pushing and trying to
preserve net neutrality because a lot of
people still think it's important we
hope that you guys have learned more
about net neutrality by watching this
show
if you have and you're feeling compelled
to contact your members of Congress
whether they be members of the House of
the Senate then feel free to go ahead
and do that aside from all this though
there is still hope because there are
several internet rights groups as well
as 23 state attorneys general who have
sued the FCC over the passage of the
restoring Internet freedom order there
have been sort of ongoing accusations of
possible like like a Jeep I just got a
donation of a rifle from the NRA for
some random reason he got a donation
rifle
yeah the NRA was like hey you helped
save the Internet so here's a rifle but
we can't actually show it because that
would actually break the rules but we're
promising you this rifle and when you're
able to accept it then you can accept it
which is kind of weird anyway point is
there's a lot of scrutiny going on right
now and if anything untoward has
happened or especially illegal or
especially anyone who's making decisions
on the behalf of a large corporation or
their own personal interests versus the
interests of most Americans then we hope
that it will be discovered and something
will be done about it anyway let's move
on because it's easy to get to check and
admire when you're interfering into that
territory let's let's talk about what's
news oh yeah just news this tech news
just tech news in general and yeah
so I was originally gonna include this
little bits in the in the cryptocurrency
segments but I decided not to simply
because it's and give you more articles
for this segment helped me spray yeah
help me spread everything out really but
hardware solar mass drop says in video
predicts draft graphics cards prices
will continue to go up through the year
know this articles from PC gamer
is originated from mass drop and that is
theoretically from Nvidia but you should
bear in mind when you're reading about
this information where it actually comes
from so mass drop they if you're not
familiar with mass trap they they sell
stuff they get a bunch of people to go
in and all decide to buy a thing
together and they able to buy that for a
lower price but you don't get the thing
immediately it's not like you go and
agree to buy that thing and then it gets
shipped to you use it it's like they'll
have it open for a couple weeks or
something like that
bunch of people will agree to buy a
thing the more people that agree to buy
that thing they look new prop them that
will lower the price because more people
are buying it but you have to wait like
til the drop ends and then usually it's
one to two weeks or take depending on
the everything after that that you
actually get the product often it's a
really cool way to buy something for
cheaper than you would normally pay just
standard MSRP and they've been doing
stuff with graphics cards including like
a 1080 TI now 1080i should sell for
seven-date hundred dollars so a mass
trap for a 1080 TI for nine hundred and
fifty bucks is maybe not that exciting
to you but they're doing it nonetheless
and apparently they're still selling
them maybe because of all those
cryptocurrency miners that we've talked
about back in the cryptocurrency segment
but it is important to know where this
article is originating from which is a
discussion thread on the gtx 980ti drop
and specifically a quote from tech
community lead Bratt Brian Hutchins from
master up so he's a master up employee
but he was referring to when Nvidia came
to visit mass drop headquarters so
there's a little bit of like hearsay
involved here but if I can assume that
what Nvidia said to Brian was accurate
and that he's relaying it to us
accurately what a video was saying is
that they're not expecting graphics card
prices to drop anytime soon and in fact
they're expecting increases according to
the article through q3 through q3 to me
me
since August September yeah which is
most of this here which is not good news
for anyone who is considering buying a
graphics card the causes for the current
shortages according to the quotes are
from these fancy new cell phones the new
cell phones coming up from Apple Samsung
and others last year started using the
same memory as graphics cards Apple and
Samsung are willing to pay more for this
memory this has created a shortage of
memory for the much smaller companies
like MSI gigabyte Asus and EVGA to make
graphics cards stop what I just told you
has a clarification here that you should
keep in mind most cell phones pretty
much all smartphones the the anyone who
discussed this technology is currently
aware of don't use gddr5 or gddr5 X
memory the memory that would be used in
graphics card the graphics cards
excuse me yeah they use ddr4 ddr4 L
memory gddr5 and gddr5 X is a fast
memory but it's not necessarily geared
towards efficiency and efficiency is
what you wanted in cell phones so these
people are lying to there's not
necessarily a direct correlation between
ddr4 and ddr4 l usage with smartphones
and a shortage of the graphics memory
that specifically used some graphics
cards however the speculation of the
article is that DRAM manufacturers have
been shifting production from gddr5 to
these ddr4 variants in order to meet the
demand of cell phone manufacturers who
might be willing to pay more money for
them now I don't know enough about the
fabrication of memory to know if there's
just some sort of switch you can flip at
the fab it's like oh we're we're we're
cranking out the DDR from the gddr5 boss
and like oh we would maybe want ddr4 all
right you know and then suddenly you're
producing like I'm getting these more
complexity to it to it than that
probably but there may be some viability
to the you know a fad being able to
switch from one type to another since it
is memory and there is some similarity
at the base level so all that said
crappy news and it sucks that's like the
speculation is that DRAM manufacturers
might be shifting their their
manufacturing from gddr5 to ddr4 causing
shortage of gddr5 memory and gddr5 X
memory causing the prices for those to
go up causing nvidia as well as they're
adding board partners to raise the base
level price of their graphics cards
right that's on top of the increased
demand of the graphics cards from
cryptocurrency miners who might be
buying them all up it's even the lower
MSRP anyway so sorry that my first bit
of news here is was bad news let's move
PC gamer did ask him video about Nvidia
said no comment so we don't know maybe
it's all BS sure that the person who's
smoking the articles fired okay let's
talk about a rumor from WC CF Tech and
rumor rumor rumor rumor rumor
maybe maybe possibly not true who knows
but we'll still talk about it a little
bit anyway we talked about this a bit
last week and the basic idea is that
right right now we have NVIDIA Pascal
based graphics cards that are on the
market the 10 series the GTX 1080 and
1080i and 1070 and so forth are based on
Pascal architecture 16 nanometer
manufacturing process however NVIDIA has
volta and they already have products
based on volt I like the Titan V Balto's
manufactured on 12 nanometer and Volta
sauce also a new architecture and the
expectation has been that
Volta will also become available in the
mainstream graphics market as well
the speculation and the article and the
rumor is that one they're expecting a
new graphics card launched from AMD
fairly soon specifically a March 26 to
29 AMD I'm stood exa AMD Nvidia yeah my
bad
they're expecting in a video launch of
new graphics cards March 26th to 29th
hgtc the GeForce technology conference
at Nvidia holds every year which is
fairly soon that's about a month from
now but also beyond that these are going
to be what's called ampere Kurtz and
ampere we first sort of talked about a
little bit last week being the rumored
codename for a new GPU architecture
which has not been previously disclosed
by Nvidia at all like there has never
there are no Nvidia like you'll see
Nvidia you know roadmaps like slides
that get published at the tech events
that they have in that kind of thing
where they say all right here's what
here's what we're looking at in the
future and you can see like volta on
there and you can you can see Pascal
Volta and Peter has never appeared on
any official Nvidia documentation
doesn't mean that it's not happening
doesn't mean that's not happening and
the article points out that's it has
been a frequent subject of leaks and
rumors so take that for what it's worth
so the saw that one fan in my half the
show is asking about right do you
believe that new geforce cards are
coming out in the next month yes he was
talking about the amperior yeah this is
very specifically so ampere
is well that's actually touring right
there so Turing and ampere are the two
code names that are getting tossed
around right now and the idea seems to
be that there will be no consumer-based
Volta GPUs they're gonna they're gonna
leapfrog Volta and that there's going to
be a 12 nanometer and peer architecture
which maybe is a Volta variation or
maybe a refinement of Volta specifically
made to be good at gaming
yeah and that's again for gaming GPUs as
well as a 12 nanometer touring based set
of GPUs and that's crypto analyst Alan
Alan Turing right there and the touring
GPUs would be a completely new
architecture that would be optimized for
AI and machine learning the cards that
are rumored to be launched next month
would be based on GA 104 G forced and
peer 104 which would be the success for
successor to GP 104 which is what like
ten eighty and ten seventy are based on
and so the G a 104 would have expected
performance similar to like a 1080i but
it would be the same size as like the GP
104 so it would be the small chip and
then maybe if they continue with what
they've done in the past that needs
expect to see a ga 102 at some point in
the future that you would have a
next-gen ti you know 1080 TI level card
based on but of course again all this is
speculation
how does Nvidia or any GP manufacture
for that matter hype up a GPU launch
right now because I feel like the one
thing they had going for them for the 10
series was we have a 1080 the GTX 10 I
still remember that launch they're like
where did we launch it for like $4.99
MSRP and everyone went buck wild but
like how do they hype this up for us now
when they're like this is a cut
next level next generation graphics card
selling it for a low low price of $9.99
like that's what the the new 10a B is
going to be like how how do they ever
get that like I'm not sure because
there's there's there's the pricing that
is the inflated cryptocurrency affected
pricing and then there's the more
reasonable like there's people who are
who when they're selling 10 70s for 400
bucks and 10 80s for 600 bucks and 1080
T is for 7 or 800 bucks system and
Titans for a thousand there are people
who would think that that is too much
money but obviously NVIDIA is able to
sell them for that much so you know that
that seems to be a balance in the market
to some degree like they're there
there's their moving product at that
price I guess it's balance so as the
miners think that's a great deal and the
gamers think that's a shit deal and so
it averages out to like a matte but itis
but I feel so I mean but but the
influence of mining is something that is
it's it's like potentially fickle you're
not sure if it's going to stay there or
not so as Nvidia is launching products
later this year I'm sure they're
probably having this discussion
internally as well it's like how do we
address this to people do we list a sane
and reasonable MSRP that falls in line
with the ones that we've done in the
past when cryptocurrency wasn't a thing
and wasn't factoring in on the price but
then of course when the products
launched they're actually gonna sell for
more than that or do we suddenly inflate
our MSRP s by 2 or 300 bucks because we
know that's what the products are gonna
sell for in the current marketplace it's
I don't like I don't know I don't know
how they can handle that and I don't
know I don't know what they're gonna do
I mean I hope they stick with the lower
prices just because that sort of to some
degree reinforces that this is what
those products should cost right but who
knows you know
also listed in the rumors in the article
did I mention that this was sourced from
tweak town by the way me yeah you might
have mentioned it hey Anthony posted the
since week ten it was this is all
sourced from some friend of Anthony's on
tweet ten that's like literally where it
comes from he's like it's like some
inside scoop friend but Anthony has lots
of connections so we'll give it as a
fitted the doubt there supposedly going
to be using Samsung's new 16 gigabit per
second GDD are six memory so that's cool
and then of course we have no idea what
the names are actually going to be
what's been tossed around is a GTX 2082
follow ups the GTX 1080 but it could
just as easily be the gtx 1180 because
they've gone you know 789 they didn't
was there I may be naive e9e 1080 1180
right or 2080 who knows accompany a 2080
it could be 1180 stones maybe a 2070 or
1170 or they could just decide this
entire naming scheme we're gonna go with
already called the GTX 1 start over just
started with one like Xbox simplify
things anyway though GTC starts March 26
ends March 29th so by the end of this
month we should hopefully have an answer
one way or the other
let's move on to this little story from
the Mobile World Congress which is going
on right now this is from NN techcom and
WD Western Digital has demoed a crazy
fast SD card with a PCI Express by one
interface 880 megabytes per second read
speed on an SD card that's really fast I
can say as someone who records 4k video
with some degree of regularity I want
this but see even USB 3 doesn't saturate
that you'd have to get I guess USB 3.1
gen2 PCE right but then wouldn't you
still have to like I mean how would you
capture this
Oh we'll see there's the other huzzle
there you go that is the other half of
it right there so this was a demo that
they set up at Mobile World Congress
which again is going on right now in
Barcelona Spain españa and yeah they use
an MDOT to to SD adapter with an SD card
so there's an SD card there's the
adapter m2m that - of course pipes
directly into PCIe lanes so that's the
basic you know physical arrangement of
it again the speeds they were they were
showing off as being tested at the demo
with crystal disk mark where 880
megabytes per second peak sequential
reads 430 megabytes per second peak
sequential writes so definitely a fall
off and writes there but still not not
not shabby at all well within the range
of a very high-end SSD which is super
nice for an SD card
they used the existing UHS 2 and UHS 3
pins on the SD card to construct a pcie
3.0 by one interface with the system so
basically they just connected those
contact points to the PCIe contact
points they used a mechanical adapter
for it presumably they also used a PCIe
voltage they use a converter to convert
the the standard PCIe voltage to be
compatible with the SD card WD said they
have no immediate product based on this
they just wanted to do a proof of
concept and this falls in line with the
SD card Association calling on the
industry to adopt a PCIe adopt PCIe as a
standard interface and support
development of a complete SD PCIe
standard key features would include
using existing form factors so it's not
like you'd have a different shape or
size of SD card or anything like that
you'd be using existing tooling and that
kind of thing it would use the PCI in a
PCIe interface with the nvme protocol
much like modern MDOT - SSDs do and it
would support legacy SD interface as
well for backwards compatibility you can
boot off of an SD card
potentially yeah yeah that's cool yeah
that or I mean just the the ability to
cuz I mean these are you so frequently
now for like really high density high so
does that mean the SD card itself is
like a new wave of SD card
oh yeah nvme if it's PCIe supported yeah
you need I mean you're still using NAND
memory and the SS and in the drop in the
SD card itself these will still be those
new cameras like that every
theoretically yet if it's backwards
compatibility then you could potentially
have a car s D card that comes out like
this that you can plug into a an
existing camera that'll read and write
it at modern-day speeds but if you were
to take it and plug it into you know an
adapter like this then it could read it
right right what what I find interesting
about this is that like my own personal
experience with SD cards is that I use
them for for video when I'm when I'm
recording videos for the channel and I'm
curious to see if capturing it with one
of these SD cards like if the ingestion
process would be that much faster
through the PCIe interface yeah then
then USB because you're your captain a
much lower read and write speed than a
turn 80 megabyte per second I think the
fastest SD cards right now oh yeah it
says right here you'd be able to use
uhs-1 goes all the way up to six hundred
and twenty four megabytes per second
full duplex I'm sorry at UHS three so
capturing up would be faster with these
oh yeah definitely
and it does look like there's a slightly
different layout here for the contact
point saying you'd also have to remove
your your your tempered glass side panel
every time you wanted to capture footage
uh yeah or maybe there's a pass through
like an adapter needed a hotspot right
and not to envy me hot spot in cases now
that's the next thing where you can just
pop I could see like a ste card you know
like an expansion slot a rear expansion
slot with a little ribbon that goes over
the m dot too so there's something
Meimei I don't know this that's that's a
possibility but ya thought that was kind
of fancy all right speaking of the
Mobile World Congress and there's one
more article linked in the description
from storage review about these new
microSD cards a little bit more
information on there as well as WD
launching some full nvme SSDs that they
have just been working on so it's good
to see Western Digital getting into this
space I know some of their first forays
into making SSDs were not that awesome
but the pcs n 720 is what they were
talking about their capacities up to 2
terabytes sequential reads up to 3400 so
clauncher writes up to 2800 and random
reads and writes at 500 and 400,000 I
ops respectively which is all pretty
nice pretty nice pics yeah they going
all right that's all I have for my
regular content for today so we are
gonna really quickly read down donation
comments so thanks to guys who have
donated bark me $10 hashtag gargle your
granny granny well I mean really not
good because we invented it as I'll say
it's it's a new sensation sweeping the
world my favorite pastime activity
thank you very much Park can hide $12
recommendation for case to match my end
to elite will be Neffs
unread need room for EA tx5 hard drives
one SSD the King and through primo
thoughts a case to match your into elite
what do you mean by matching your into
lead if you only need five hard drive
trades I mean I don't know the the new
fractal case the define r6 has some
pretty nice hard drive configuration
options and it's it's sleek looks looks
pretty professional in strategy if
you're trying to match an end to elite
then that's a whole other level bro yeah
that's a very interesting question that
I'm not exactly sure how
maybe I'm not sure what maybe you should
go with the Primo then and stick with
fence yeah the Primo is great or the
enthu Pro M is also a fantastic case
any-any fantex case really but yeah
hungry oh I'll probably be using that
soon to thank Andrews wire five
Canadians here's some money making you
two even in donations if you include
last week thank you Paul you got my last
name correct pronounced schwa Schreyer
that's why I said do wait
we have we have excellent pronunciation
on this show Sui you sure you Michael so
simple visits tripped us up a little bit
$10 donation hey guys have either do you
use in the pebeo xqb er micro-atx / Mini
ITX case and if not which one would you
recommend for around 50 um
I am on the verge of like re hunting
down what my favorite micro ATX cases
are right now because I haven't been a
build in a while and you know and I need
to reassess that right so I don't have
that in my head but I do know that the
appellate cases I've worked with in the
past have not impressed me I will say
that you know I have used one it's
actually the one I used for my best
$1000 PC that you could build okay this
was over a year ago and I had a gtx 1070
in there which now would run you almost
$1000 yeah by itself so the give gives
you some sort of indication of how far
back this video was but I used in the
pentia case that from what I recall from
my testing had decent thermals for the
GPU and CPU it wasn't the highest
quality case but and it didn't look that
great but there was a lot of airflow
going through it and allowed me and it
allowed me to get a gtx 1070 within a
$1,000 budget so there you go gonna make
some compromises
Lex Avellino $25 thanks for commenting
on the build it's actually completely
CGI / 3d as in not real I made it in
blender you are a funny guy check out my
latest tweet to you for screenshots of
the model unless you're being serious
and I thought that your CGI graphics
were real I don't know which system
you're talking about you better check
your tweet your tweets that I will take
actually I find them I complimented you
on a completely fictional CV but thank
you very much for the donation that's
very generous of you Lex next we've got
lawn mowers
hi guys started following you - about a
year ago when I decided to do my first
