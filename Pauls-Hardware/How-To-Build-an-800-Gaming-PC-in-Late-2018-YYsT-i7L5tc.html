hardware today's video is a beginner's
guide on how to build a computer I've
done these many times in the past but
today's video I think it's kind of
special because for one graphics card
prices have finally dropped to the point
where you can build a pretty solid
mid-range gaming computer which is what
we're building today for about eight
hundred dollars also this is my build of
the month video for July 2018 and every
month at the beginning of the month I do
build lists videos so the first part of
building a PC is choosing the parts and
if you're wondering how I chose these
parts check out my July builds video
posted earlier this month finally it's
my first time building in the Leanne Lee
0:11 err chassis so I'm going to be
taking a closer look at that at the same
time the master case each 500 M by
Coolermaster sports dual tortor
millimeter addressable RGB fans a USB
3.1 gen2 type-c port and 4 tempered
glass side panels both sides top and
front and the front can swap out for a
mesh panel if you want maximum airflow
it has a plethora of cable routing
covers to keep things tidy too so click
the sponsor link in the description to
learn more so what are the highlights of
this $800 PC well first you have an r5
1600 CPU which is a 6 core 12 thread
processor from AMD this is a very solid
processor for both gaming as well as
doing some media creation as well as
possibly gaming and streaming at the
same time if that's something you're
interested in we've also got a very
solid mid-range graphics card in the RX
580 with 8 gigabytes of video memory and
a bonus here is that you if you decide
to upgrade to a gaming monitor it is
free sync compatible and those tend to
be a little bit less expensive other
than that we've got 8 gigabytes of ddr4
memory a 240 gig SSD to load our
operating system on - as well as a nice
feature set on our motherboard I'm gonna
go over each part individually really
quick to talk about not just the part
itself that I'm building with today but
sort of the range of parts that you
might choose for each component that
you're choosing because that's one of
the benefits of building your own
computer is choosing the parts yourself
also building it yourself will allow you
to go and in the future to do upgrades
or repairs if needs be
now a cool thing about this build is
that since 2 or 3 weeks ago when I put
all the parts together in the list it
has actually dropped in price by about
50 dollars thanks to selling the
motherboard as well as the SSD going
down in price now I've taken that 50
extra dollars and I've applied it to the
case the Leanne Lee 0:11 air
more in the 120 240 dollar range
depending where you buy it and that is
probably not the best bet because if you
have extra unexpected money to spend on
your computer you're probably going to
want to apply it somewhere where you get
a little bit more performance so let me
talk about the prices of each of our
components and where you might more
intelligently spend your extra $50 to
get more performance starting with the
CPU and the CPU is often a place where
you might start when you're building a
computer choose your CPU and then work
from there the horizon 5 1600 is a great
choice right now because you can get it
for about a hundred and fifty dollars
six cores and twelve threads it's a very
good performer and you get a lot of bang
for your buck it's also on a platform
which is socket AM 4 which has quite a
few different motherboard chipsets
available for it but socket and 4 is
compatible with a lot of different AMD
CPUs including second generation rising
processors the 2000 series CPUs such as
the 2600 and 2700 X that said if you're
going to upgrade the 1600 to something
else I would recommend these 1700 even
though it is still also first gen rising
you get eight cores and sixteen threads
and that is a big bump without spending
too much extra cash for me next on the
list for potential upgrades would
probably be the SSD or the memory we
have an 8 gig memory kit here which will
get us by but 16 gigs is a lot nicer
we're gonna pay about $100 for a 8 gig
ddr4 kit that's about ddr4 3000 speed
and we do want faster ddr4 3,000 or so
speed memory for our arrays and platform
because it does benefit a lot from
faster memory you also want to make sure
that your memory is compatible and will
work so I specifically went into the
memory compatibility list for this
motherboard in order to make sure that
the kit I chose will work out of the box
which is the case for the g.skill
ripjaws for kit that I've chosen if you
do have a bit of extra cash though you
can for about 60 or 70 dollars more get
a 16 gig memory kit for the 160 hundred
and seventy dollars range just again
double check that kit that you choose
make sure it will work with your x3 70
or x4 70 or B 350 or B 450 a motherboard
that you have chosen and again make sure
to get memory that's pretty decently
fast I would recommend 3,000 speed or
faster I always recommend SSDs for your
operating system drive at least and 240
gigs will get you by this SSD is
actually only about 54 dollars right now
but if you've got again extra 40 50
bucks to spend you can get a 400
gig SSD and that will get you just a lot
more basic system storage space
especially for loading up games and that
kind of thing it is nice to have more
storage space but if you can't afford
that or if you just want to stick to the
budget just remember to grab another
hard drive so for 40 or 50 bucks you
should be able to get yourself a one
terabyte hard drive or do what I
recommend and find an old computer
somewhere that you can steal the hard
drive from format it and then use it as
a storage drive in your new system now
the graphics card could be upgraded as
well but this is about a $250 graphics
card also consider the gtx 1066 gig
that's another good option in this range
but to level up from here you're
probably going to need to spend about
$400 so for that reason I would say
don't consider that for now but yes this
system could handle a higher-end
graphics card in the future the case
again you're probably going to want to
stick to about a 60 or $70 range for and
here there are just so many options the
H 500 from NZXT the P 400 from fantex
that I originally recommended there's
others as well so just choose a case
that has good reviews decent airflow and
that matches your aesthetic tastes
finally for the power supply my
requirements are 550 to 650 watts 80
plus bronze rated or better and then a
final bonus is if you can find one that
has all black cables like this one here
the corsair power supply that's
recommended in the parts list will
actually be available for 40 to 50
dollars this one will cost you a little
bit more but it also has the bonus of
being 80 plus gold rated which will give
us a little bit more efficiency and it's
fully modular so we have plugs for all
the cables we only need ease the ones
that we're actually going to use so if
all goes well today the only tools I'll
really need are a Phillips head
screwdriver and I like to have to have
something to cut with but let's talk a
little bit about our motherboard choice
before we move on this is an X 370
motherboard that refers to the chipset
and then the sockets which is right here
that's where the CPU actually goes is a
m4 these sockets is gonna be very
important for the motherboard that you
choose and to make sure that the
motherboard and the socket are
compatible with your processor and then
beyond that there's some other features
I would look for now the reason I chose
x3 70 for this and you can go X 370 or
x4 70 that 470 is a little bit newer I
would also potentially have you guys
look at B 350 and B 450 motherboards the
b4 50s are going to be the newest the X
series boards though tend to cost a
little bit more but they also tend to be
a little bit better this board is on so
right now though for $100 and even with
a $20 mil and rebate after that so
that's part of the thing helping keep
the cost down but by going with a
slightly higher and motherboard you
might get better power delivery over
here so that might allow you to
overclock the CPU if that's something
you're interested in and all these rides
and CPUs are unlocked for overclocking
the other features I looked for we're
making sure it had four dimm slots here
so we can upgrade our memory in the
future I like that this motherboard has
Wi-Fi integrated 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi so
it comes with a couple antenna right
here that you can connect to the Wi-Fi
that's integrated onto the back and
finally I've got a couple of these m2
slots and MDOT two slots at least these
particular ones are made for newer types
of storage drive like this little m2
nvme drive right here
you don't need drives that are this fast
for a gaming system but it's nice to be
able to upgrade to them in the future
and having two of those just gives you
again more expand ability for the future
this is an MDOT to slot up here as well
but it's a different type of m2 and it's
made just for Wi-Fi cards that was all
pretty decent amount of exposition but
we're actually going to start building
right now just to be safe and to test
some parts before we put everything
together we're going to do what's called
an outside-of-the-box build so for that
I have our motherboard outs some other
motherboard accessories you want to grab
just to have them out right now are
gonna be your i/o shield right there I
got a couple SATA cables so we can
connect our storage drives in a minute
also got the Wi-Fi antenna we don't
really need this stuff right now but I
have it out motherboard manual is going
to be key to help figure out a few
things and then the parts I'm interested
in testing right now are going to be the
memory the motherboard of course we're
going to test out the graphics card and
then we've got the power supply and our
processing so another way we're saving a
little bit of money on this build is
going with the stock heatsink fan for
the processor the 1600 will come with a
race aspire which is a perfectly decent
little cooler yes this can be upgraded
as well in the future but for now it'll
get the job done this has four mounting
points on the bottom and will usually
have some pre applied thermal paste this
one has been used before so I'm going to
be applying my own thermal paste but
check that out and see if you've got
some pre applied there in which case
just don't touch it or anything leave it
in place and then you won't need to
apply your own the CPU itself will come
in its own protective clam shell this is
actually a 1600 X CPU but effectively
exactly the same for our installation
processes here and then we're actually
also going to need to do a little bit of
preparation on the mother
because and for motherboards to come
with a plastic bracket right here and
there are some coolers that latch down
to this bracket via these two attachment
points on the outside but the stock
heatsink fan actually doesn't use that
we need to remove this bracket first I
should have mentioned this already but
static electricity is something that you
should at least pay some attention to
when you're working with computer parts
like this if you are concerned about ESD
electrostatic discharge and you can want
to take your power supply plug it into a
grounded outlet you don't need to turn
the power supply on then just touch the
housing and that will make sure that you
are electro statically discharged and
then you can continue to work on your
sensitive electronic components
when I remove those two brackets the
back plates came loose this motherboard
does have a back plates on the back
which sits in there just like that so
just bear in mind as we're setting our
motherboard down on our non conductive
cardboard box here that it came in to
keep that kind of in place and then we
can go ahead and install our CPU so now
we're gonna install our CPU so we're
gonna open the clamshell be careful in
this part because the CPUs do have pins
on the bottom and those pins can be bent
and you definitely do not want to do
that so hold the CPU by the edges and
then note if you look at it from the
bottom or the top there should be one
corner that has a triangle on it so note
that triangle and then look at the
socket itself there should be a small
little little tiny triangle on the
corner of that socket as well now we're
going to lift up this little retention
arm on the side of the socket and that
will open it up line up the triangle and
simply drop the CPU down into the socket
should require no pressure zero
insertion force required to install that
CPU just like these mugs that I sell
with a zero insertion force screw on it
you guys should all buy one of those
available on my store it pulsar Burnett
anyway once that once you double check
that the CPU is all the way down in the
socket all you got to do is lower that
retention arm and it is installed now
we're going to install the CPU cooler
again you'll usually have some
pre-applied single-use thermal paste on
there if it's a brand new CPU we do not
have that so we're gonna apply our own
thermal paste with just a blob right
here in the center if you have old
thermal paste that you need to clean for
some reason you can use some paper
towels and
rubbing alcohol for our purposes though
we've got a little blob in the center I
usually go smaller than a pea but larger
than a grain of rice and then we're
going to set our CPU cooler directly on
top of that lining up four screws and
now we're going to tighten the four
screws but don't just tighten one corner
all the way down I usually like to get
it just threaded on there then go across
to the opposite corner we'll do the same
there with just a turn or two and we'll
get corner number three threaded and
corner number four is threaded on there
and then we can go ahead and tighten
down the other quarters and there we go
it should be nice and secure on there
our CPU cooler is installed now there
should be a plug coming off of it this
is a fan plug four pin and there should
be a four pin header on the motherboard
that says CPU fan if you can't find the
CPU fan header on your motherboard it's
a good time to double check the manual
which should have a layout of where
those all are and for pretty much any
plug that you're plugging into while
installing a computer there's only one
way to plug it in so there is a key on
one side of this just make sure you line
that up next we're gonna install the
memory we have two sticks and we have
four slots so again you should
double-check your manual to make sure
which slots you should install too
because you do want these in dual
channel mode usually it's going to be
every other slots and usually it'll be
the further two slots from the actual
CPU that they want you to start with so
we're gonna go with slot number two slot
number four here there's clasps on
either side sometimes but this
motherboard design actually only has
clasps on one side and then the memory
itself has a notch in the middle it's
not quite in the middle slightly offset
so you notice the notch here is on this
side so we're gonna flip the memory over
line up the two sides with the slots and
then give it firm pressure straight down
and you should get a little snap in on
the side that lets you know it's
installed it's usually a very satisfying
feeling memory is also very easy to
remove and that's why memory is an easy
thing to upgrade because all you have to
do is loosen that little slot lift it
out and there you go so memory
installation memory removal one of the
easier things to upgrade in a DIY PC
just a couple more things to do for our
outside-of-the-box test setup we need
power to the motherboard and there are
two main power connectors from the power
supply to the motherboard there's an
eight pin this is the supplemental CPU
power which is up
in the top left on the board and then
there's the main 24 pin power connector
both of these have little catches on one
side of them so you can only plug that
plug in one way and I meant a - keep an
eye out for when it comes to power
supply put plugs or the CPU supplemental
plug which is a block of eight four plus
four like that and then the graphics
card supplemental power which is also a
block of eight but it's going to be a
six plus two like that again these are
also keyed in there so it's very
challenging to actually plug a PCI
Express graphics plug into the CPU one
on the motherboard but it is important
to know that both exists because is one
of the things that you might get to
confused about that you're popping and
clasp itself pretty easily and then we
will bring 24-pin around here for the
main and plug that in like so I bear in
mind for these 24 pins they can be
pretty sticky sometimes so you might
want to give the motherboard a little
bit of support underneath it and if you
do need to unplug it just keep the clasp
loosened and you can kind of rock it
back and forth and you should eventually
be able to get it to come loose there we
go last part to plug in this could be
the graphics card and that goes in the
top full-length PCI Express slot right
here this is a by 16 slot and asrock has
reinforced it with some steel there to
make it look flashy er and maybe even
more sturdy who knows there's a long PCI
Express graphics plug on one side of the
graphics card and it should be able to
drop in just like this when we install
in a case there's gonna be some
connections over here that hold this a
lot more securely so for now just keep
an eye on it it will be a little bit
wobbly but the last thing we need to
plug in for power is going to be our GPU
supplemental power from the power supply
which plugs in just like the other plugs
did we're now ready for our first
initial test boots and this is going to
be encounter one of two with the front
panel connectors on the motherboard
which are some little pin outs which are
kind of annoying to get at but you're
going to want to find the ones that say
power button and you're going to bridge
a connection between them with just a
piece of metal or a flathead screwdriver
for just a second oh actually before you
do that you should plug in and turn on
your power supply then you can bridge
that connection for just a second and
the computer should turn on I've pulled
out a dusty monitor here and connected
it up just so we can see some stuff on
screen hopefully and prove that our
graphics card is working but and
all signs of success are going to be
thin spinning on the CPU cooler as well
as the graphics card as well as lights
generally lighting up on the motherboard
and there we have it we have
successfully booted into the BIOS or the
UEFI as it's also known and we can see a
quick listing of the components that we
have installed now I don't have a
keyboard or anything attached here if
you wanted at this point you could go
ahead and plug in drives and start
loading windows and everything but for
all intents and purposes we have working
Hardware here and we can go ahead and
install it in the case own people always
ask me how to turn off the outside of
the box build just the same way you
turned it on hit that power button one
more time it doesn't turn off
immediately
hold it on for about eight seconds so
here's our case the LAN Li PC o 11 err
this is a pretty new case but the
original version of it the O 11 dynamic
was very popular and well received and
pretty well designed but whether you got
this case or a different case
all standard tower style ATX cases are
gonna have some similarities usually
you're gonna have some intakes some fan
intakes
in the front you usually have some
exhausts usually at the top in the back
or the top of the case in general this
case is somewhat unique in that it also
has some exhaust straight back that
direction which not all cases have but
that just gives you some other airflow
and liquid cooling options and then the
super popular thing these days is to
have a tempered glass side panel so you
can see in at your system once you've
actually put it together this tempered
glass has some plastic sheeting on it so
I'm gonna leave that on well we do our
build will peel it off at the very ends
so we keep that protected while we do
that but then finally from the back here
we can see where our motherboard IO will
be so our motherboard tray is right in
there like that's our graphics card
outputs and it will be right here and
then the power supply will be over on
this side and then most cases also have
an area on the left behind the
motherboard tray where you can do cable
management one of the nice things about
this case is it's a little bit wider so
it gives you a lot more room to do your
cable management so we're moving on to
the case and the first thing you're
gonna want to do with any case is pretty
much disassemble it or at least take off
the side panels maybe the front and top
panel as well just to give yourself a
better idea of how it's all put together
this case for example has a top panel
that actually needs to be removed before
your side panels can be removed which is
an interesting design but I kind of like
how the tempered glass sits in there
actually
but not to get too distracted though the
case is going to have typical mounting
locations for most stuff so motherboard
is gonna go on the motherboard tray
right in there whereas a power supply
gonna go down here in the back at the
bottom where is the graphics card gonna
go I'm just gonna sit on top of the
motherboard and it's gonna have outputs
right here what else in the case needs
to be connected up it comes with two
pre-installed fans at the front here
four intakes that's for the standard LAN
Lea 0:11
air this is the zero eleven air RGB
which means it came with a three pack of
three extra RGB fans which I could
install but I'm not going to because I'm
going to pretend this is the less
expensive version and honestly two
hundred twenty millimeter front intake
fans is good but these fans are going to
need some power connection and that's
probably gonna plug into your
motherboard and then the case itself is
almost always going to have a collection
of cables that come from the front panel
area which is to connect up the front
panel for USB 3.0 this one actually also
has USB 3.1 gen2 which our motherboard
does not have so that connection is just
not going to be used and we've also got
HD audio for the front audio jacks as
well as those kind of pain-in-the-butt
front panel connectors for power reset
and LEDs lastly you want to consider
where your drives go so SSD is gonna go
and one of these drive trays down in the
bottom our hard drive actually has a
couple options this case has a vertical
rail here that could mount a couple 3.5
inch drives to it but actually what I
think I'm gonna use as this little
tucked-away spot in the back which
actually has a couple Drive cages that
you can mount the drives to slot them in
there and then you can actually access
them from the back also tucked in here
is our case accessories which you might
be interested in as well here's the
accessories they come in that little box
for these screws here with the kind of
rougher thread on them those are going
to be for the power supply will mount
that in just a second
are these finer thread screws here these
are going to be for mounting the
motherboard to the motherboard standoffs
they've also thrown in a few extra
motherboard standoffs there although
most of them are pre-installed and now
we've got these guys and these guys are
actually made specifically for spinning
mechanical drives 3.5 inch drives
because if you have one of the drive
trays it might have little rubber mounts
like that those just pop right in there
and then mount the drive from underneath
I'm gonna get the power supply installed
just so I can plug power into
thing else as I install it other than
the three cables coming off of this that
we already used in our test setup I've
just plugged in the SATA power for this
as well since we have two drives to plug
in each we'll need a single SATA power
plug the power supply does have a fan
intake here so it's going to want to
draw air in from the side panel so we'll
want to have that facing out just drop
the power supply in like so so I think
move on to installing the drives next
since we have those up and ready to go
pretty simple to install just flip the
drives over and there's mounting points
on the bottom I did have to switch these
little grommets over one notch on this
but the spacer screws line up and screw
in just like that and that gives us a
little bit of a shock mount on it to
help reduce some vibration noise while
the drive is spinning and then the 2.5
inch driver as the steam mounts the same
way just with four screws from the
bottom and both of these have little
brackets that will hold them in place
and then we can install them so now
they're ready to go in but each Drive is
going to connect to the power supply for
SATA power and that is via the longer
l-shaped plugged on the back and then
there's a shorter l-shaped plug then
that is for data that will require a
SATA data cable that's going to plug
into the motherboard to make things
easier I'm just going to pre plug these
in so there's my SATA plug for the 3.5
inch drive alright guys and our drives
are installed they managed to use just a
single SATA power cable from the power
supply to go down here to this lower SSD
first and then reach up there to the
upper hard drive I probably need an
additional cable if I wanted to add more
drives to this but everything is wired
up and installed for now we're now ready
to install the motherboard into the case
and before you install any motherboards
you're gonna want an i/o shield which is
basically a little panel that goes over
the inputs and outputs on the back of
the board it provides some protection
for the back of the case as well as some
electrostatic discharge contact points
for some of these inputs and outputs and
we always want to make sure this is
installed first before installing our
motherboard just make sure you've got it
lined up properly with the inputs and
outputs and you should be able to push
it in from the inside of the case
sometimes they will give you a bit of a
hard time in which case just get the
butt of a screwdriver
and you should be able to pop it in and
now before we drop our motherboard in we
want to double check our standoffs
we have one two three four five six
seven eight and nine that's the standard
layout for a standard ATX motherboards
so we can drop a motherboard on top of
that give a little push to the side now
we can just go ahead and screw in all
nine screws and you don't want to over
tighten these just get them snug if you
over tighten them then there's a chance
that when you try to remove this
motherboard at some point in the future
that will you you will also unscrew the
motherboard stand off beneath it that's
annoying
a quick note here this motherboard
actually has ten standoffs there's one
extra one right here that's actually a
micro ATX standoff points I'm not
putting a standoff and a screw there you
can if you want to but it's not really
required since we have all nine
otherwise at this point everything is
pretty much installed except for the
graphics card and we're gonna wait and
do that last and I've also gone behind
here and done a decent amount of cable
management there is that harddrive
bracket back there and by removing that
I was able to access stuff a little bit
more easily and just pushed everything
through these grommets here so it would
come out in about the location I would
need it so for example 24 pin main
motherboard power connector is right
there so we can plug that in eight pin
supplemental CPU power connector is over
here so we can plug that back in these
are the same things that we plugged in
when we did that outside of the box
build and then I do have a main power
plug coming out here for the graphics
card but we're just going to set that
aside for now let's move on to the other
plugs that I have passed through here
there is a longer USB 3.0 plug here this
motherboard has two headers for that so
it doesn't matter which one we plug into
I also got two fan plugs coming from the
two fans at the front of the case these
are four pin plugs but fans can be
either three or four pin we're just
going to plug those into fan headers
that we can locate on the motherboard
there's a chassis fan head right there
and then another one over here at the
bottom next up we have two SATA data
plugs and these are coming from the SSD
at the front and the 3.5 inch mechanical
drive at the back so these are just
going to plug into one of our six
available SATA ports or SATA headers on
the motherboard and again here it
doesn't matter which of these you plug
each drive into and then we've got a
couple more front panel headers this is
the HD audio plug this is the same exact
size as a USB 2.0 plug just bear in mind
there
are nine out of the eight pins that are
actually populated and the blank pin is
different on USB 2 versus HD audio so it
is challenging to get those mixed up but
bear in mind they are the same size and
last but certainly the most annoying are
our main front panel connectors again
this is so that the power and reset
button on the front of the case works as
well as the little lights that blink on
power and reset you can plug in either
way it doesn't matter which pin they're
plugged into but the LED does have a
plus and a minus so depending on the
motherboard you're using you might have
printed text on the motherboard itself
that shows you which pins you should
plug into if you're not sure definitely
double check the manual and the final
piece we will install here is the
graphics card for that there's some
expansion slot covers here at the back
so again Phillips head screwdriver and
we'll remove the two of these that line
up with the PCI Express slot that we are
going to be installing the graphics card
to and then for this part you guys have
done this before so just drop the
graphics card straight down into that
empty slots and it should slot into
place that should be a little bit more
satisfying this time because you should
also be lining up on the back with your
rear bracket next up just replacing
those two Phillips head screws on the
back bracket and that should make
everything feel nice and stable in there
although this end of the graphics card
tends to be a little wobbly and then
lastly we have PCI Express graphics
power connection and we should have just
enough room to plug that into all right
guys we are now at the point where you
would maybe think about putting like the
side panels back on and everything but
no don't do that quite yet
first you're gonna want to find your
power cord for your power supply go
ahead and plug that in go ahead and
switch your power supply on and then hit
the power button and now your system
should turn on this is again excellent
news everything's powering on we got
lights we've got spinning fans front
fans are spinning and everything's
looking pretty tidy of course at this
point what do you do next
very good question and I have a video
specifically on that topic so I would
direct you now to my first five things
to do with a new PC build where I walk
you through installing Windows 10 as
well as some other stuff don't forget to
watch the follow up three more things
video as well because I supplement it so
check both of those videos out if you
want to know what to do next
well guys the system came together quite
nicely and whether you're a first-time
builder or you've done this a hundred
times before I hope you maybe have
learned a little bit of something from
watching this video my final thoughts on
the Lian Li 0:11 air are that it's a
very easy case to build in I like
there's a lot of space I like that it's
not insanely tall or insanely huge it's
just a little bit wider than normal
chassis I think if it came across a
downside it would probably be a similar
complaint to what gamers Nexus have
which is that the dust filters on the
case although they are everywhere are
not the most ideal they're held on by
magnets and gamers Nexus also saw that
if you remove that front dust filter it
actually improves the airflow and the
thermal performance of the case quite a
bit but again guys check out that first
five things to do with a new PC build if
you're wondering what next steps are
thanking you so much for watching this
video and we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
