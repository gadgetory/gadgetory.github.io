hey everyone how's it going - welcome to
Paul's hardware it is nearing the end of
2017 and today I actually have sort of a
bunch of random stuff to do around here
so I thought at the same time I would
ask you guys via Twitter if you had any
questions for me to end the year so
we've collected some of those I'm going
to be just sort of setting up this
system over here to ship out I'm gonna
be taking this system over here apart
and putting some stuff away and just
trying to get tidied up and prepared for
the next year in the meantime though
let's start with question number 1 you
have any plans for a home server built
in 2018 alright so this question is from
Bob Roche at CPU kid on Twitter and yes
actually so earlier this year is a four
or five months ago I went and I got this
big old piece of walnut and been
intending to wall mount that along with
my htpc and a lot of people have asked
about that and I haven't followed up
with it several reasons contributing to
that but one of them is I think I'm
gonna make it more than just the HTTP
see I think I'm going to integrate
server as part of their at the part of
that as well so because that's kind of
been evolving over time I haven't gotten
to it yet but yes I do plan to set up
something akin to that in 2018 and
hopefully I have more details on that
for you soon what is the best time to
purchase a Tektronix and its lifecycle
to maximize value open time example get
CPU community after march vs. Lane six
months thanks XP this is questions from
two Moon Studios on Twitter at Tumen
studios and it's a good question and it
probably varies based on the product
that you're talking about CPUs for
instance on the Intel side if you look
at the past I don't know five ten years
don't tend to drop in price all that
much however the AMD CPUs that they've
come out with this year already did have
some pretty significant price discounts
and everything especially just in the
past few weeks going through audio sales
and Black Friday so
I would say a couple months after
initial launch is a good time period to
wait to sort of see if anything bad
might happen for example if you go all
the way back to say when Sandy Bridge
launched p67 motherboards at the time
had an issue with the chipset and they
had to issue a recall which was a pretty
big deal at the time stuff like that
will come out pretty early in the
products life cycle usually and then
when it comes to discounts usually brand
new products aren't going to be
discounted if you give it a couple
months depending on how successful the
product is you may or may not actually
see a discount at that point so that's a
little generic but hopefully that helps
you out a little bit major static
computers and I don't know what type of
degrees I could get to work in the field
thanks all right so this questions from
extra-large chai or a bad juju gumbo on
Twitter and just asking about schooling
when it comes to getting in the
computers and first off I guess I should
point out I did not go to school at all
for anything computer related I studied
film and television so you don't
necessarily need that background but it
could help computer science would be one
that you should definitely investigate I
would say definitely look into getting
more familiar with software and
programming that is definitely an area
that if I went back to myself and wanted
to re reassess what I was focusing on I
would spend more time on the software
side of it and then finally if you're
interested in the hardware side of it
then injury engineering and specifically
electrical engineering that's what your
focus should be on there what is the
most expensive mistake yet have you ever
made similar a computer this question is
from Christopher Christopher at Mill Dog
2010 on Twitter and I've thought I've
actually been asked this question a few
times somewhat recently and I've had to
think about it because I guess whereas
on the one hand you have Linus who
apparently drops and breaks things all
the time
I don't know if I'm just more careful or
more lucky but I don't think I've really
destroyed that much when it comes to
computer parts I will say that if I go
back to my days at new egg and this may
or may not be my fault I I cannot take
full responsibility for this but there
was a 39
60x engineering sample which was a over
$1000 cpu at the time and it died and it
may or may not have been due to ESD some
electrostatic discharge or it might not
have been my fault at all
I wish I could give you more details but
I've been sworn to Secrets secrecy and
silence by the others who were involved
at the time but definitely killing a
very expensive high-end piece of
computer hardware especially a high-end
graphics card or CPU I'd say that that
ranks right up there with it that's my
story I wish had more details than that
what is your most favorite case ever
made a good question
alright so we're gonna be working with a
case later today which you the video may
or may not be up for maybe that'll be a
really good case but I don't know I'm
speculating on that all right might
define our five over there which I
modified for arctic panther I really
like is a case just because it's a
reasonable size it's not on right now
and anything so it's not looking like
it's a reasonable size I modified it and
put tempered glass on but it's not just
like a piece of tempered glass it's an
actual steel side panel with a window
cutout in it which personally I like
much better than just these tempered
glass pieces by themselves
I also modified it to put a USB type-c
USB Gen 1 USB 3.1 gen2 type-c connector
on there so it's got all the modern
connections and functionality that you'd
want the other case of pops into my mind
when you bring up that question is the
courser 650d which is a case that is a
similar sort of box like design to the
define r5 the corsair came out with and
one of the reasons I really like that
case is because it's in my mind still
has one of the best side panels as far
as accessibility that that has ever
existed simply due to the fact that they
they put two latches right here so the
side panel goes like that two latches it
pops out a little bit and then you can
just lift it off and away which in my
experience at the time like if you had
anything in front of the case but you
needed to get inside there there's just
a really good solution I believe it had
that on both sides as well so it made
access to the interior of the case very
easily very easy
other than that it was a well-designed
case at this point it would be a little
outdated simply due to the you know
probably didn't have USB three and that
kind of thing but I really like the side
panel this design it was just very
functional and I also like the overall
look of that one with the rush metal and
everything thought that was cool
like a game developers are shooting away
from multi-gpu slight performance and
Pascal is horrible Thanks this questions
from lathe Salman or doc Leith on
Twitter and yeah it's a good question
because SLI multi-gpu configurations
crossfire on the AMD side although they
don't call it crossfire anymore
they're sort of those drool-worthy high
ends configurations that a lot of people
would look up to and the fact was though
and this is from talking to different
industry reps some Nvidia folks and that
kind of thing actual people who have a
two-way SLI or crossfire setup with two
graphics cards let alone three or
four-way is very very very small I don't
have any actual stats for you but I
believe it was down in the like less
than 2% range for SLI and then even much
lower than that when it comes to
three-way and four-way configurations it
also takes a significant amount of
research and development work in
developments of drivers and especially
development of drivers with different
new games that might come out so you're
talking about a lot of man-hours and
work on the back end for both the GPU
manufacturer as well as software
developers of the games and at a certain
point they just realized you know what
it's not practical to be investing this
amount of time and effort into a
configuration that is used so little by
so few people so even though lots of
people look at that kind of thing
because it's the highest of the high end
of what you can get so few people are
using it that they kind of stopped even
even doing driver support for that I can
look at some benchmarking suites that
are specifically just made for
benchmarking like 3dmark and those are
still updated and those do still have
driver support for multi-gpu
configurations but keeping up support
for something like that that's a lot
more contained and it's not a whole new
game or anything like that is a lot
easier for them
maintaining support for lots of
different games so that's pretty much
what it comes down to money investment
of time and also just the amount of
people who are actually into it so it's
obviously two sides to that and you
might fall on one side or the other
whether you think it's it's a useful
thing to keep up with in support of SLI
or crossfire configurations but for now
it looks like two-way is the max it's
going to be should I look at getting
baggage of PC gaming or wait until
cryptocurrency money stops the algae
prizes on GPUs okay Patrick roseberry at
raging iguana on YouTube I'm sorry on
Twitter I like you I like your Twitter
handle the difficult question because
speculation has evolved in stuff and we
don't really know exactly what's going
to happen with a cryptocurrency
I don't see cryptocurrency disappearing
anytime soon by any stretch the the
validity of mining cryptocurrency with
gaming GPUs also may or may not be
something that stays popular so for your
purposes I would look more at the ramp
races because the GPU prices have
fluctuated they've gone up and down and
if you follow the markets for example
you can get a Vega 56 or a Vega 64 for
almost MSRP if you were following along
in the past few weeks they of course
would back up again but they do dip the
overall price of memory though due to
the man shortage is crazy high so that
is anticipated potentially to start
falling off as some production ramps up
and some of the fabs in 2018 so I would
keep an eye on that maybe give a couple
months into 2018 to look at those prices
and then of course keep an eye on the
GPU prices but just bear in mind the
volatility of cryptocurrency can also
affect the volatility of GPU prices and
it's if you can predict that sort of
thing you probably have a much better
job prospects than I do
coming up in the near future because
it's never been anything that I've been
interested in attempting want me to do a
liquid cooling build and I am unsure if
I should look at coal mine
okay and today a UTI with the release of
copulate it's a worth it to wait and buy
copulate and your mobile or should I
just stick with my hat so Jerry the
question is about liquid cooling and
should you water cool you're 67 or K and
1080 TI the way you're discussing this
makes me think you're considering a full
custom loop in which case I hope that
you have been saving money for that
because a full custom loop is expensive
and is not often the most you can get
for your money when it comes to actual
PC performance in your situation if you
really want the most you can get you got
a 1080i you're doing just fine with that
for now
yes you could upgrade your 6700 K to
copy Lake that would be a huge upgrade
and there's also a lot of stuff rumored
to be happening in 2018 so I'd say
you're pretty good for now with your
hardware setup when it comes to liquid
cooling if you're interested in setting
up that custom loop bear in mind that
the Intel sockets have maintained
backwards compatibility when it comes to
the actual coolers for quite some time
so you could for example take a LGA 1150
1151 1156 CPU mount cooler and still use
it for example with coffee lake it might
be a good time to start parting out some
of your custom loop and then you might
also potentially have an upgrade path to
still use like a CPU block that you get
right now even next year when Intel
comes out with whatever next gen stuff
they're coming out with next year all
that said just please bear in mind
custom look and cooling loop is not the
best bang for your buck when it comes to
the amount of performance you get for
your money so just keep in mind you're
gonna spend probably between 400 and
$1000 on the cooling and I would try to
make sure that that stuff can be used
for as long as possible which CPU
generation do you feel was the most
innovative and why this question is from
Randy Martin are at name brand Randy on
Twitter and it's a little vague here so
I'm assuming you're talking about the
entire lifespan of computers as it has
ever since there were consumer computers
out there there's probably lots of
potential answers to this question but I
would actually go for the stuff that AMD
was working on back in 2005 and 2006
with their
original Athlon FX series of processors
because they did some crazy innovative
stuff back then that's Intel at the time
they kind of said you know we don't need
to do that stuff or anything the inter
integrated the memory controller onto
the CPU and they also introduced dual
core they also introduced 64-bit CPU
architecture so that didn't all happen
at exactly the same time but it is all
kind of that same timeframe and it
really gave Intel a kick in the pants
right around 2005-2006 AMD was on top
they were winning and it wasn't until a
good 11 or 12 years later coming back to
this this year in 2017 that AMD finally
actually has sort of come back again
when it comes to their cpu game so I
think that's what I would point to well
we do for a cold night bar what would I
do for Klondike bar man that's an old
reference I used to have so I'm old
right I'm older so I used to have VHS
tapes recorded of movies you know they
come on actually we had a Betamax - back
in the day and I remember we'd record
movies from TV and then they'd have the
commercials in them and I'm that's what
the Klondike bar commercial reminds me
of would you dress up like a clown
that's the one yeah yeah I would dress
up like a clown that's the only thing I
would dress up like a clown for what is
your favorite video you produce this
year and what was your favorite text
uber video this year oh that's a good
question this one's from Lenny at malice
Fox on Twitter and so if I'm going pee
early by revenue my my for reasons
PC building sucks right now that video
took off lots got lots of views on that
lots of feedback so not necessarily my
favorite video though I kind of go back
to the LGA versus PGA video was one that
I did this year that I felt like turned
out really well
so that was a lot of fun the arctic
panther build series of course was a lot
of work but also a lot of fun and
actually still ongoing that's not a
single video so I don't know if I could
I don't know if that counts
and then also what's my favorite tech
tuber video this year also a very good
question I not a specific video but I
really like the work the gamers Nexus
has been doing this years they've just
really been setting the bar when it
comes to the level of testing and
validation of different components and
that kind of kind of thing
no single video stands out but um yeah I
have a lot of respect for the work that
Steve and company are doing over there
and I would also throw in the hardware
connects video that they did just kind
of recently talking about the vertical
GPU mounts on cases when you put a GPU
right here just doing some practical
real-world world testing of a
configuration that has gained popularity
due to an aesthetic value but actually
tested it and found when you have
especially a tempered glass side panel
right here up against a vertically
mounted GPU that's believe it or not it
blocks a decent amount of the air and
your GPU runs hotter and it affects the
performance so I like the practical
testing like that and I do feel like
it's something that I need to do a
little bit more of this coming year so
I'm gonna do more of that this year I'm
gonna do games this is a Cole Cortez at
sea underscore Cortes 84 on Twitter and
let's see so you're starting a channel
something so the advice that I usually
give in the Kyle
I feel like it gives pretty frequently
people ask us about starting a youtube
channel is not to start it with the
intent of it being a full-time job of
your profession to do it because you
enjoy making the videos because you
enjoy the contents not necessarily
because you want lots of views or you
want lots of money that might come in
the future but you need to start from
the right mindset from the beginning and
if that mindset is I'm gonna make
YouTube I'm gonna make youtube channel
I'm gonna be famous I'm gonna make lots
of money I just I haven't seen many
people achieve success because it takes
a lot of work several years of work
building up a channel from the get-go
and you should not be looking at view
counts you should be looking at the
feedback you get from the people who do
watch you should be responding to that
you should be updating your content and
adjusting it so that it's still true to
what you want to do but also a
has some vague aspiration towards
appealing to the people who you want to
watch your channel as well and then just
remain diligence and just don't have
high expectations from the get-go it
takes a long time to get started and get
the ball rolling especially now compared
to five or ten years ago so yeah just
make sure that you're doing it because
you enjoy it and not because not because
of the money the money comes later power
alright guys I would like to thank you
for bearing with me today since I have
really just had some kind of logistical
cleanup and tacking of stuff to do but I
was happy to answer some of your
questions at the same time if you missed
it then go ahead and follow me on
Twitter at Paul Hardware and perhaps
next time I do a Q&amp;amp;A you can get a
question in there as well in the
meantime I got that H 400 I build all
taken apart and the case back in there
the case actually I it's pretty pretty
nice case I felt like it was just the
build overall with the various quirks
and everything ended up pissing me off
so maybe we'll see that again in the
future
and then of course this is the entry
level thread Ripper giveaway PC which
I'm picking the winner of today but use
probably in the past for you guys by the
time you see this video point is that's
all packed up here and then I got all
the retail boxes and a graphics card in
this box over there so whoever the lucky
winner is we'll get that shipped to them
ASAP
once they answer their email of course
but guys that's gonna wrap it up for
this video so hit the thumbs up button
if you enjoyed it thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
