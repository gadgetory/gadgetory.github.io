Nevada is brought to you by coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool all
right guys I'm over at Wynn was invited
by Nvidia here to share some of the
stuff they have going on at CES 2018 and
that's several really cool things it's
also raining on me and there's there's
also a velociraptor over there somewhere
so I'll try to make this quick
first off g-force now you guys may or
may not have heard of it it's basically
what Nvidia is doing with their grid
technology servers render games and then
stream the game over the internet and
send the images to you and you can play
that video game on something that's much
less powerful than a typical gaming PC
GeForce now is still in beta but they've
expanded it a bit they're adding a bunch
of Ubisoft games six including Rainbow
six siege and fortnight they've also
added 120 FPS mode now it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're gonna see
the game 120 frames per second it means
it's going to render it 120 frames per
second and send those frames over the
Internet to you at a higher rate so that
you get better latency so even if you're
playing on a 60 Hertz display you'll
still only see 60 frames per second but
you'll see frames faster reducing
latency which is of course very
important when you're playing a game
that's being rendered on a remote server
so basically what this allows you to do
is take something like a very
inexpensive laptop maybe a $400 laptops
that if you tried to play pub G on it
would get maybe a couple frames per
second but then that you're streaming
the game from Nvidia servers and you're
getting a much more reasonable frame
rate 60 90 120 fps again depending on
the game they need to enable the higher
frame rate for the game in order for
that to work you can even play lots of
PC games now on Macs with GeForce now
allow you access to PC gaming on a Mac
in places where the PC game wasn't even
available on the Mac before so that's
pretty cool next up is what I think is
kind of the most exciting news from
Nvidia this week which is BFG D that's
big in gaming displace I sorry but big
format gaming displays is what it says
here I'm very easy to make that
confusion these are large 65 inch 4k
displays they feature g-sync
4k resolution 120 hertz refresh rate HDR
with a thousand nits of brightness
ultra-low latency i asked them for specs
on that they're not actually giving
those details out but they said they
should be on par with gaming monitors so
really good
of latency for gameplay and there's an
Nvidia shield built into the TV what
that means is although the TVs don't
necessarily have TV tuners which I
thought was an interesting choice but
you can use the Nvidia shield to access
the Internet and you can use that to
access Android apps and that kind of
thing they for instance demonstrated
streaming from Amazon in 4k grand tour
which I think I'm gonna need to start
watching now cuz that show get so much
positive buzz but I'm getting distracted
more on the gaming side of things though
they did have a destiny to demo that
they showed off and it's really just the
confluence of all of these gaming
technologies that have been available on
the PC for so long integrate it into a
huge 65 inch TV that you could use in a
living room or I guess in your gaming
room if you're okay with a really big TV
that maybe you're standing a little bit
too close to but still a good experience
all around
they had three models on display from HP
on their omen series also from Asus and
Acer and HP said that they're looking to
bring these actually to the market make
them available for purchase around fall
of this year 2018 they do not have any
pricing yet I asked them for ballpark
pricing they said if you look at like
top 10 displays that are like 4k 120
Hertz maybe not with all this technology
in it but in that ballpark they said in
that ballpark so take that for what it's
worth maybe maybe you'll be able to
afford one of these I think these are
really cool but I'm hoping it's not one
of those really cool things that Nvidia
comes out with that only the richest
people are able to actually afford one
last thing I wanted to mention this is
just some updates that they've been
making the GeForce experience first off
is something called freestyle which I
initially looked at and thought to
myself hmm they're taking Instagram
filters and allowing you to apply them
to the games that you're playing
basically big middle finger to anyone
who's put a lot of work into the art
style of the game but know this makes a
little bit more sense when you look at
it for example the most useful thing you
could do with freestyle is colorblind
settings so if you are a colorblind
person you can put a colorblind mode on
a game that didn't otherwise have it and
I think that's the most practical use of
this but colors and filters overlays
there's a big menu of ones that are
available they had 15 preset so you can
go in in to individually adjust settings
on them and you can overlap them with
each other as well so you can then do
that
get it all set up for your favorite game
and then you can save a preset for your
game up to three presets per game that's
stored and saved by GeForce experience
and then just go ahead and switch
between those and whatever game you're
playing whether you want a sepia tone so
it looks like you're playing a very old
game or you whether whether you want
really crazy over saturation or you want
it to look really dark and gritty or
that kind of thing even sharpening
settings and that kind of thing there is
potentially a two to seven percent
performance hits on the game when it
comes to framerate so do bear that in
mind this is something that happens in
the driver so there is a little bit of
overhead but not too bad and then again
up to three presets per game so plug
them in and get your freestyle on also
they've updated Ansel and Ansel now has
a little bit more access to some of
these overlays as well so there is a new
Ansel UI as well
Nvidia actually did have a couple more
things on display new max-q notebooks
for example a new and updated Ansel UI
but of course we are always limited on
time at CES 2018 so I have to wrap it up
for this video guys if you did enjoy it
hit the thumbs up button I'm gonna be
back with more coverage from Las Vegas
Nevada for CES 2018 and of course a big
thank you to my sponsors for this event
Coolermaster enter max ocz Toshiba and
deep cool thanks for watching guys we'll
see in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
