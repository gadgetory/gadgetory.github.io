welcome to this very short video it's
going to be very limited on information
but I am going to be bringing you what
could very well be an exclusive world
first unboxing of the geforce gtx 980ti
that's right it's here and videos
announced it in fact they have
additional information about this card
that I don't even know yet but I'm going
to find out soon that would be the price
and the launch date I won't find that
out for a couple hours I can't tell you
in this video but when I do find out
I'll post it down in the video's
description so you guys can find that
information out too
anyway this is a the of course almost an
engineering sample this is the founders
edition of the 1080 TI it will cost the
same roughly MSRP as the ones that are
actually coming out this is of course
invidious retail box and all that good
stuff they have a bit of documentation
back in there I'm sure this is all this
all the detailed private information
about what Nvidia does and their and
their spare time I suppose
and here it is a 1080i since it is the
founder tradition it looks very similar
to a GTX 1080 which you might have may
have seen before it comes in a lovely
packaging right here and I'm just going
to set it here so we can upload it just
briefly I really like the founders
edition design I've said this before I
think they do a very good job with it
you might notice the main difference
being here the CI they've added the CI
to the penny and then there is a power
delivery difference here where we've
gone from an 810 a single intensive
affinity to a 6 pin and an a-10 visit
1080p I so there it is other than that
pretty much the same when it comes to
the design they have improved the cooler
they've made it a little bit better they
showed us some charts on that I don't I
don't know the detail information to
rattle it off for you right here but I
do have some specs as tip so you guys
know these words do have anti-static
bags in videos properly packaging these
so now we get that no one get mad at
Brian
the surgeon and yeah so thanks for this
twelve billion transistors on the GP
itself which is a beauty 102 is the GPU
with in there so it's entually of the
same GPU as the Titan XP but a purser is
going to be complete variations to
configurations and everything it's got a
1.6 gigahertz boost clock 2 gigahertz OC
from what they're saying which I imagine
means when you overclock it up in around
about 2 gigahertz yes I'm getting a
positive indication for there
swanny a streaming 20 SM units with 128
chord each so that's that's how many
FM's are in there those are the same
building blocks obscenity is built on of
course 3584 CUDA cores xx of geometry
units 224 texture units 6g pcs which are
draft graphics processing clusters
mediate rock units and 350 two-bit gddr5
memory and they did discuss gddr5 x vs h
vm to memory DDR 5x is not only more
available but the HTM to memory isn't
fast enough yet they're still making it
faster so they say when with gddr5 X
here and actually found this the
performance here at least in this
particular iteration was better than
what was they could have gotten with HB
M 2 so that's why they won with that and
then finally for memory capacities at
gddr5 X memory there is 11 gig that's
right
11 gigs of it in there an interesting
number but they did actually make a
spinal tap reference which was totally
appropriate and everything should go to
11 I completely agree
anyway guys we're expecting that these
will be reviewed soon again there's lots
of information that we still don't know
I'm going to post price and launch date
as soon as I get that in the comment
section down below hit the thumbs up
button on this video if you enjoyed it
and it was very quick and hastily put
together but I wanted to get you guys
something on this for lush as NVIDIA has
just now confirms if this exists and
will be for sale soon check the
description links and stuffer down there
thanks for watching see you next time
