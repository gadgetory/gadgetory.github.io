hardware this is my monthly builds video
for September 2018 and today I'm gonna
tell you how to build the fastest one
say the fastest gaming PC possible for
now the enter max liquid tech cr.42
all-in-one liquid CPU cooler has a
massive contact plate made just for
thread Ripper and is rated for 500 watts
of heat dissipation high pressure pwm
fans mount two rubber channels on the
radiator to absorb vibration and the
sexy logo and edge lighting on the block
is addressable for syncing with your
motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box too so
click the spots or link in the
description for more so if you're not
familiar with this series every month at
the beginning of the month I part out a
couple pcs I'm not actually gonna build
the system's today so if you're
interested in actual builds check out my
builds playlist here it is
featuring just recently my build of the
month for last month which I built and
then tested that's pretty much the mo
plan the builds in one video build one
of the system's in another video test
one of the builds later in the month
that's a process that I can't seem to
stop doing and if you wants to take part
in next month's builds video then go
ahead and check out the strawpoll length
in the video's description for what pc
builds you want to see in october and
then of course last month i did this
multiple choice selection which many
people chose many multiple different
things but the top vote-getter was a
back-to-school build for school work
right but but actually for gaming we
also wanted the most epic writer for to
build possible i didn't do that this
month mainly because threader / - kind
of fizzled people are not very
interested in that I'm gonna follow up
with some more thread Ripper - content
but just not right now
and then we're also pretty close to the
top was AMD and $500 budget so I've
combined a few of those ideas into the
first build for today this actually is
my February build sub $500 gaming PC and
this was about 470 bucks at the time now
it's down to about 420 dollars so we
have had some price drops and I did a
full how to build tutorial on this
system as well as they follow up with
setting things up and testing it so to
that end I have my four hundred and
fifty dollar back to school gaming PC it
has some upgrades compared to that one I
did at the beginning of the year first
off in that we're using a 2400 G instead
of a 2200 G so this is a four core eight
thread CPU it's got a bit better
integrated video graphics than the 2200
G it costs a little bit more but you can
for about hundred and fifty five dollars
right now but bear in mind when you're
looking at the total price for this
build at four hundred and fifty bucks
you could easily shave about fifty bucks
off of that and make this a four hundred
dollar build if you just go with the
twenty-two hundred G which is four cores
and four threads still an APU so it's
still got graphics integrated and you
can get that for about a hundred bucks
here you'll get a little bit more
lifespan out of the CPU side of this but
both of these are designed with the idea
that in the future you will upgrade
these to a system with the graphics card
these are going to use an APU the
integrated CPU and GPU together on the
same chip but you can take it discrete
graphics card which you can buy for you
know 200 to 500 ish dollars drop-in
alongside that and give yourself a
really big boost in gaming performance
and I've also done a test on upgrading
this 500 build to a more like a $750
build so check out that video too if you
want to see some of the difference
between the two but if you're just
getting at a PC gaming and you've got a
budget of 400 to 500 dollars this is
what I would recommend you build and of
course this is back-to-school build so
you know you can use it for school work
and stuff too that's that's what you
explained that's how you explain it to
your parents and you look you say look
mom and dad this doesn't even have a
graphics card so it's not even like a
gaming PC right truth is you can game
just fine with this CPU at 1920 by 1080
most games you want to play for tonight
or anything like that and it comes with
a cooler to the AMD Wraith stealth so
that will get you by again for now this
system has lots of potential upgrades
and if you're interested in the
difference between performance from a
2400 G to a 2200 G check out my apu
testing video that i did earlier this
year where I ran some benchmark
comparisons between the two but apart
from that core component the CPU and GPU
combo we have a motherboard for about
$80 we have an 8 gig memory kit for
about $85 a 240 gig SSD for about $40
and then a case for 60 and a power
supply for about $30 so let's run down
those and why I choose what I choose
I want micro ATX for this build because
I like it as a form factor it's a little
bit bigger than mini ITX and you have
the potential for a little bit more
expansion because you're not limited to
just a single PCI Express expansion slot
I chose this as rock board the B 450 M
pro 4 because with the precision the be
350 motherboards asrock had some really
good choices down in the budget range
for 70 or $80 actually
decent power delivery with some cooling
on it so you can get some overclocking
out of this board it's got 2m about two
slots for upgrading your storage in the
future if you want to go with the
high-speed m2 and via me drive one there
and then one down in the bottom right
only four SATA ports so bear that in
mind but you're probably not gonna be
maxing this out with SATA drives it has
the requisite 4 memory slots so you can
upgrade your memory in the future which
is very important and then it even has a
couple RGB headers both in addressable
5-volt as well as the standard 12 volt
RGB headers so if you do want to
customize your system in the future with
some LEDs I don't recommend doing that
right off the bat because you don't get
extra performance out of LEDs but it
does have the headers on there so for
$70 I think that's a nice set of
features for B 450 board for memory I
chose this Team 8 gig kits and eight
gigs is kind of on the low side for a
system right now but memory is one of
the more expensive components still that
you have to buy also and I've addressed
this many times with Rison systems
before it's better to go with faster
speed memory so the ddr4 memory speed
that you'll read is usually going to be
2666 3030 200 and it gets faster I
recommend 3,000 or 3,200 speed memory or
faster with an 8 gig kits and then also
double checking the motherboard that
you've chosen to make sure that on the
motherboards memory compatibility list
the ticket you've chosen has been tested
with Rison so that you can plug in the
XMP speeds and get it to run at that
speed I chose this kit in particular
because it's $85 it's not specifically
on the memory list for the motherboard
that I chose but we do have some
positive feedback including one guy down
here who just bought it within the past
couple months who said gigabyte gamer 3
motherboard and an AMD Reisen 7 1700 X
CPU 3200 speed with no problems so we're
trusting that guy and that this memory
is going to work and the team T force
Vulcan kits have worked pretty well for
me in the past too and one of the
biggest upgrades you can do to this
system although what up the base price
by a decent amount is going with 16 gigs
our 2 by 8 gig kits instead of the 8 gig
version either way I would go with the 2
by 8 gig or 2 by 4 gig kits and remember
again with 4 slots you could add more
memory in the future or get rid of the
kit you already have an upgrade memory
is a really simple thing to upgrade but
it's also a pretty key component for
getting the most performance out of your
eysan system so more on that in my how
to build videos so check those out if
you want a little bit more feedback for
their main ether components these are
pretty swappable you could easily go
with something different than what i
have specifically chosen here in
particular for the storage since I'm on
PC part picker and they have a thing
called a parametric filter told it I
want an SSD I want a capacity range
that's going to give me a 240 gig or a
256 gig drive and then I'm sorting them
by price and you can get 240 gig SSDs
for 40 bucks which is pretty cheap right
now again here you might want to double
check reality check if you have a brand
that you like or one that you've seen
reviews on I've personally used the
SanDisk SSD plus for quite a few builds
so that's one that I often will
recommend to people for a case that
shows the fractal design focus G mini
and here I was pretty much looking for a
micro ATX case that was in the price
range that would fit with this build so
about fifty to sixty dollars you could
spend a little bit more on a case if you
want to but this one is going to give
you a couple one hundred and twenty
millimeter fans built in so you will
have your airflow taken care of and you
can swap one to the back if you didn't
like the all intake configuration fits
full-size ATX power supplies it's a
micro ATX case so we're gonna take
advantage of it and being a little bit
smaller since this is a back-to-school
build I wanted it to be somewhat
portable so you could take it with you
it's got a clear plexi side window so
you can take a look at your system after
you put it together and also some decent
cable manage options so this is a
perfectly adequate choice but of course
if you find another cases in that range
its micro ATX and you like the look of
it better or the reviews better by all
means feel free to swap that out finally
for a power supply I wanted a 550 watt
power supply I wanted it to be 80 plus
bronze rated and then of course I wanted
it to be somewhat aesthetically okay
looking this power supply is not modular
so all the cables can pre connected but
that's okay to deal with I just wanted
to make sure that they were all black of
course if you can find another power
supply that suits you better like a
modular one provides some convenience or
going with a better efficiency rating
like 80 plus gold again feel free to
swap that and power supplies are pretty
swappable as long as it's ATX and those
are all the parts for my $450 back to
school gaming pc bear in mind here again
lots of potential upgrades here you're
gonna want to add another hard drive for
example so you might want to budget 40
bucks for that
if you don't have one around that you
could use of course you're gonna want
Windows to install in there so there are
some more expenses but you also have the
upgrade potential of going with a 16 gig
kit instead of a 2 by 4 gig kit or of
course adding a graphics card in the
future adding more storage but that's
really where the fun of building your
own computer comes from is all of the
modularity upgrades you can do in the
future let's move on though so my next
build is more on the expensive side
total price here is 2356 dollars and 49
cents as of today including a mail-in
rebate and this is the fastest gaming PC
that you could possibly build for right
now any time I use an absolute like
fastest I have to remind you guys my
mantra which is never speak in absolutes
and for that I need to point out I'm not
going all-out throw as much money at the
build as possible this is still a build
I find somewhat sensible and I would say
if you want some of the core components
here this is kind of what I would guide
you towards we have the highest end
Intel mainstream processor that's the
8700 K which is a 6 core 12 thread
processor and it's got the best
instructions per clock and that's gonna
correlate to the best gaming performance
right now that's even better than the
Intel high-end desktop stuff that they
have an X 299 again for right now
because we're expecting an Intel 9000
series CPU launch maybe very soon we're
not really sure so for anyone investing
in this bear in mind you're probably
gonna have faster Intel processors
coming out very soon but the second part
of this of course is that NVIDIA has
announced and will be launching
theoretically in about 11 days their GT
I'm sorry their RTX series the RT X 2080
and RT X xx atti they're supposed to
ship out on the 20th of this month and
they're already available for sale and
pre-order in a lot of different places
now I want to point out and reiterate I
do not recommend pre-ordering the RT X
2080 or 2880 hours the 27 T once that's
available you should wait until there's
inter independent reviews of these cards
before you go and you drop your money
that said there are people who are like
I want to build the best gaming computer
I can build right now so this is my
answer for people who would want to do
that with what's available or available
very soon and the total price of 23 or
24 hundred dollars is of course very
expensive but it's not like absolutely
insane expensive when it comes to
high-end gaming pcs so let's run down
these parts apart from that 80
700k I paired it with a 240 millimeter
all-in-one locally cooler from
Coolermaster now there are other air
cooling options that are out there but
if you're gonna get the CPU and you're
going for the fastest gaming performance
you're probably gonna want to overclock
it and a 240 millimeter all-in-one is a
good choice for that I've used this one
before it's nice and quiet it gets the
job done and Wow you can get it for as
cheap as 60 dollars although I did find
out that this Amazon link is broken on
Amazon if you go directly and look up
the master liquid light 240 you can get
the white LED one for $52 but we're kind
of splitting hairs when it comes to the
overall price of this system any 240
millimeter all-in-one will do just fine
but if you can get those $70 I think
it's a good choice for our motherboard I
usually go in the 150 to $200 range for
mainstream Intel motherboards and I've
chosen the Z 370 or s gaming 5 which I
just found has a nice set of features
four dimm slots of course it's got some
lighting on it which you might find
appealing or not that's entirely up to
your aesthetic decision but let's talk
functionality it's got that USB 3.1 gen2
front panel connector as well as the
slightly older USB 3.0 connector there
it has good lighting options apart from
the LEDs built into the motherboard it
has RGB W header are up there which is
nice to have if you like having white
options in the RGB LEDs too and it's
also got the 5 volts addressable header
there too so either way you will have
support for your RGB strips it's got
very solid power delivery for
overclocking and it's got a couple PCI
Express slots if you do decide to go
with a two-way configuration in the
future more LED headers down at the
bottom oh and look a debug LED I like
having that for your motherboards that's
just a nice feature there - oh and did I
mention 3m two slots one two and three
you probably don't need more than two in
fact if you go with more than two you're
probably gonna run into some potential
conflicts with SATA ports and otherwise
but better to have it there than not I
would say and 470 dollars that's a good
motherboard running down the rest of the
parts on the list we have a 16 gig
memory kit ddr4 3200 fast memory isn't
quite as important with Intel as it is
with AMD but best memory is still good
and then the less-than for about a
hundred and fifty dollars you can get
this set I focus purely on gaming
performance here so of course you could
great to a 32gig kit that would be
completely reasonable for this system
but 16 gigs is all you really need if
you're not concerned about say gaming
and streaming at the same time if you
are gonna stream at the same time
upgrade that memory that would be a good
choice for storage I chose an MDOT to
drive because we want very fast load
times for our games if you want to
install steam on this a 500 gig main
operating system drive in the 960 Evo
which has really fast read and write
speeds it's a really good nvme drive and
it's actually come down in Christ this
is one of the first time I've
recommended one of these for like a
somewhat normal system for about a
hundred fifty-five dollars that's a good
price for the 500 gig 960 evil I was
also looking at the Western Digital
black MDOT to nvme drive but this one
has a bit better performance and it was
about the same price not just the 500
gig 960 Evo but another 1 terabyte ish
data drive and it's also about 150
dollars of course you get out of
mechanical Drive instead of this if you
wanted to save a little bit of money you
know 2 or 4 6 terabyte mechanical drive
would be a perfectly adequate solution
here but hey if we're gonna have lots of
games installed on the system that we
can load at a moment's notice
we want our steam drive to be on an SSD
and not a mechanical drive so again here
just use the PC part picker search
options to look for an SSD that is in
the 1 terabyte range and sort by price
and again just like I recommend it but
the first build just reality check here
and choose one that suits your needs
that's not terribly overpriced this is
actually from a brand you've heard of
and then there is the graphics card the
r-tx 20 80 TI and this again is only on
pre-order so currently the cheapest one
I could find that you could order right
now is $1,150 maybe GA these are
supposed to sell for as little as $1,000
but I'm not gonna pretend that they're
available for that much until I can
point you guys to somewhere where you
could actually order it for that much so
this is the one I chose just based on
was available on PC park picker you can
actually preorder it from B&amp;amp;H although
expected availability is October 22nd a
month late it's supposed to have
actually be available on September 22nd
but we'll see how shipments go when when
it comes to the early sales you can buy
this directly from the EVGA website or
pre-order I don't know you can just Auto
it notify
right now although it's 50 bucks more
expensive there for some reason compared
to bnh but anyway so you have options
for ordering right now but don't don't
order any of these 2080 or 2080 TI's
until you can actually get some reviews
from me and hopefully some other people
too rounding things out with case in the
power supply it just shows a about $100
case that I know is a good one there's a
pure base and there's a silent base both
from be quiet that you can find in this
range I just chose the all-black version
you can get the one with the orange
accents that would match with the
motherboard a little bit I suppose but I
like these because they come with nice
be quiet fans that are very quiet it's a
solid all-around case but if you have a
case that you preferred by all means
swap it in as long as it's ATX it should
work just fine and then of course power
supply here since it's a higher-end
system with a 650 watt power supply if
you are ever considering an SLI
configuration especially for 20 80s or
20 ATT eyes I'd recommend something more
like an 850 watt power supply but 650
watt 80 plus gold and then from a good
brand like EVGA and then I opted for a
fully modular version here and and and
of course the 80 plus gold a little bit
more efficient there so 80 bucks for
that and you can even get it for down to
$60 if you opt for that mail-in rebate
of course you gotta remember to fill
forms and send it in after you order it
but guys that pretty much wraps it up
for my monthly builds video for
September 2018 I'm actually gonna build
one of these systems probably going to
do that 2080 ti version because I think
I might be getting my hands on one of
those but that all remains to be seen in
the future hit that thumbs up button if
you enjoyed this though and links to the
builds lists as well as all the
individual parts are down in the
description as well as links to my
earlier videos on how to build systems
and how to set up systems and all sorts
of other helpful contents that I have on
my channel which hopefully helps you
guys out that's all for this one though
guys thanks again for watching we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
