garage work log video I'm not at my
garage I'm in my car because I'm going
to Ikea I'm gonna pick up some
countertops because I'm going to put
countertops around the edge of the
garage that's kind of the goal for the
project for today I'm also not driving
it
I've decided if I'm gonna vlog in the
car I should do it while I'm still in
the driveway anyway let's go to Ikea
I think this is what I'm looking for
these are countertops they're pre-cut
you go out these because they're
reasonably priced their actual
countertops so they actually made a wood
lease depending on which one you get I
wanted something sturdier something that
will hold up for a little bit more long
term that'll hold up to like scratches
from getting heavy stuff but on it and
stuff like that and I kinda wanna go
with the wood finish because I kind of
like the wood finish on my my work table
that I made so I just going to kind of
look through these it's gonna be a
combination of the finish that I like
which is probably gonna be kind of more
of a standard wood finishes over here
and what they have in stock because I
want to pick them up today okay I'm I'm
very hot and sweaty but I managed to
actually fit these countertops in my car
there's not much room in here I now have
an awkward ride home and I'm back home
okay so here's the garage it's probably
not looking very much different than the
last garage work log that I did but
fortunately my mission this morning was
successful so from Ikea I have three
long countertops these are all about six
feet long about two feet wide so my main
goal for this of the day today is going
to be to start on my clearing out of
crap project so I'm going to be clearing
out a lot of the stuff that you see in
the background here I of course need to
do a lot of organizing Evitts most of
these or many many of these boxes are
empty but some of them do have stuff in
them so I'm going to be kind of
separating I'm going to throw away a
bunch of old boxes that I know I don't
need anymore
and all that kind of good stuff also my
wife is out of town for the weekend
that's kind of part of why I'm doing
this project right now so I can actually
make use of the rest of the house just a
sort of temporary storage area so I'm
going to set up the camera I'm going to
do a time-lapse I'm going to start
cleaning and then if all goes well I
will end up with one of the countertops
coming up from the wall right here one
of the countertops going back there into
the corner and one of the countertops
along the back wall and that will allow
me to actually make use of some of that
space back there it's a decent little
background for me but really
functionally it's nothing other than
just storage and messy looking storage
at that so hope I can get through all
this but if not I do have today as well
as tomorrow as well as Monday today
being Saturday and if all goes well I
will have a new set or at least some new
looking stuff going on in the background
for our live show on Tuesday here goes
and there it is I am pretty much
finished for now so what you're looking
at here is pretty much my my 3 hem arp
birch countertops these are the all all
wood versions are not the ones that have
like a thin layer of wood and then like
particle board underneath wood all the
way through i think it's worth than
spending a little bit more money they
some metal ties from Home Depot to
connect it to the wall and then I got 9
actual legs that are positioned
throughout the legs I might end up
repositioning I sort of scattered them
around I don't know I don't know I
didn't really have any rhyme or reason
for it mainly it was so you could like
actually sit it at any of the inner
areas here like a desk and be
comfortable and whatnot but I think this
is going to solve several problems for
me one being hopefully it looks nice the
wood framework up top now matches the
desk top over here which now matches my
work table don't look at that side of
garage don't look at that side we like
to say also I just have a ton more like
like desktop space to work with so I'm
going to have like computers like
probably computer here and a computer
here and then like my streaming system
here and monitors and I want to put some
shelves in and I want to paint the walls
too actually which I should have done
before installing these these
countertops but what are you gonna do
you know I had to I had to move forward
and this was I think the biggest project
on my list that I felt like was holding
me back from moving on to some other
things I still got lots more work left
to do though if you saw the dining room
is pretty cluttered with all the stuff
I've been pulling out of this area I
need to go through all that might do a
little inventory video or something like
that and actually show you what a lot of
that stuff is some of its newer some of
its older some of its just boxes so yeah
also got to clean the rest of the garage
gotta set this up for the live show
tomorrow too
since it's Monday now and yeah so you'll
be seeing this on the live show you'll
be seeing more garage work logs and
other stuff like that on my channel very
soon thank you so much for watching this
video everyone don't forget to hit the
like button I know I've been hitting you

good of everyone I promise and I'll be
