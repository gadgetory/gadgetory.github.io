sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill guys of 1/3 will take so feel
free to have a play more in the comments
it'll be fun
I'm here to shop talk about some of
these cases as a core p5 wall mountable
case by Thermaltake designed for water
cooling and first off they have an
insane amount of mods here so for the
love of modding I'm going to share a
nice montage at the end of some of this
design work because it's really
fantastic and having recently struggled
with some PT PT G to bending myself I
think it's going to be worth it to show
you guys some of this what the pros can
do but apart from the p5 they have a new
case basically a smaller version so this
is the core p3 also wall mountable but
you can have it standing on a desk just
like it is so this kind of an open-air
chassis it's got a croelick panel here
at the front plenty of space in there to
work with and it's designed to allow you
to build a system that you can get a
really good look at basically from any
given angle because there's not a whole
lot going on in here you can put your
arm all the way through and of course
you can see right through that acrylic
they made this a little bit smaller for
a couple reasons one well the p5 is just
pretty damn big to was that the p5
actually had some limitations with
compatibility when it comes to
all-in-one water coolers so this one is
fully compatible with all-in-one liquid
cooling units including thermal takes of
course so you can do 120 240 or 360
right here I might even be able to wider
ones I'm not positive about that and you
do have enough room to get the cabling
over or get the tubing over from your
all-in-one unit from your CPU block you
can also rotate these brackets here for
the power supply so you can have it
horizontal or vertical and you can
position them so that it will hold
different lengths of course the graphics
cards can be positioned also sticking
out here horizontal or you can also make
them vertical so you can get a nice look
at the cooling solution for a graphics
card or of course if your liquid cooling
you can get that water block right there
so you can see the water flowing through
it the limitation here is that they push
the radiator mounting point a little bit
closer to the actual motherboard tray so
you don't have as much space for
mounting reservoirs for example but they
have put a bracket an extended bracket
here at the front so you can have a
radiator with fans behind it and they
still have room for just in front of the
radiators to put a reservoir and of
course it's going to be compatible with
standard reservoir mounting systems
whether you're working with Thermaltake
or whether you
working with reservoirs from other
vendors as for colors this is a white
version that will be coming a little bit
later it's also going to be available in
black and it should be coming out within
a couple weeks so follow thermaltake on
social media and you'll be able to find
out when it's actually available I also
want to show you these fans here because
guess what there are 48 fans and they're
all connected to the same system that
basically have a digital control
mechanism built for these fans that
means they have actually a 5 pin
connector rather than a 4 pin connector
so they're not going to be dropping
compatible with your typical fans but
you route them through a little fan
controller box which is actually fairly
small and it gives you digital control
over all of them so basically any sort
of combination you want to make of the
fans to flash in different orientations
or if you want to group them up in
different groups you can do that digital
controls over here so you can see our
PM's and that kind of thing even as a
feature where if you stop one of the
fans the controller will report it and
in just a moments it should pop up on
the screen at least when Shannon did
this a few minutes ago it worked there
it is alright so if you have a lot of
fans and one fails and you don't know
about it well hey now you know and it
even tells you which controller it's
connected to that's pretty fancy get it
fancy ok I'm finishing off over here
because obviously there are a ton of
mods and you want I want to show you
those let me get to those in just a
second a lot of them of course are built
with all Thermaltake stuff so
Thermaltake water cooling whether you
want massive radiators of all different
shapes and sizes fittings fill-in
coolant that's all there all the
fittings up here in chrome and black and
actually up here on the top right is a
sort of unique thing that we have not
seen before which is the thermal take
special fill fitting with an LED light
inside so the it illuminates the coolant
from within and gives it sort of an
ethereal unearthly glow well let's
finish this video off the way I promised
you with a montage of mods custom PC
builds there's a really really nice ones
here and I just wanted to show them off
a little bit thank you guys for watching
this video and one last shout out to my
sponsors fractal design MSI and g.skill
thanks for sending me here to Computex

we'll see you guys in the next video
