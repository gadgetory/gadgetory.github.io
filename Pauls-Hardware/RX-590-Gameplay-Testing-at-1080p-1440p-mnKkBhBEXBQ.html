back to Pauls hardware today's video is
going to be a little discussion and some
gameplay with this new graphics card
from AMD this is the AMD Radeon rx 590
it actually launched yesterday and I'm a
little late to get a video up on this
but I am going to just plug this in and
test some games today gonna try a gaming
at 14:40 as well as 1080 before that of
course will take it out of the box and
give you a closer look but more to the
point since I'm a little late on this
I've had the luxury of watching several
other reviews and reading several other
rid reviews on this particular product
and I can give you a bit of a summary
right now the RX 590 is sort of like an
overclocked rx 580 and an RX 580 is sort
of like an overclocked R X 480 we're
still using the same base GPU
architecture that AMD originally came
out when they first launched Polaris
based GPUs and it's been updated and
refined a little bit and we also have a
12 nanometer manufacturing process now
rather than the old 14 nanometer
manufacturing process which means they
can run it a bit higher frequency and
they've also upped the TDP so they
jumped from 185 watt typical board power
to 225 watts with the RX 590 we also
have higher frequencies out of the box
so just by comparison the RX 4 80s
originally had about around 1100 to 1200
megahertz clock speed ranges the 5 80s
would be more in the 1300 to 1400
megahertz range and now we have these
cards which are getting into the 1500s
and even low 1600 megahertz ranges which
is nice higher clock speed should
improve overall performance but higher
clock speeds also potentially means more
power draws so hence the increased
typical board power for the 590 versus
the 580 so if the upshot is that we now
have a new mid-range graphics card in
the RX 590 to compete with the likes of
the rx 580 or maybe in videos gtx 1066
gig then why is the response to this
launch bin sort of mediocre well i think
that was down to the price which is $279
recommended MSRP from AMD which just
seems a little bit on the high side even
if it were dropped down to maybe $250
you'd be getting a little bit more bang
for your buck down in this price range a
difference of 20 or 30 bucks actually
makes a decent difference so it's
to say that if you already have an RX
588 gig it's not gonna be worth its
upgrade to this card also if you're
already rocking an nvidia gtx 1066 gig
probably not going to make that much
difference either if there is something
that might impact your decision it would
be one if you're just looking for a
graphics card in a two hundred three
hundred dollar range in that case it's
definitely a contender and then also you
might take a look at the game bundle
that AMD has paired with this actually
if you buy an RX 590 or a vega 56 or 64
you will get this blockbuster launch
bundle which includes Resident Evil 2
the division 2 and Devil May Cry 5 all
of which are triple-a titles all of
which sell for 60 bucks each if you're
interested in those games that's a very
valuable add-on package there that's
good through February 9th 2019 so it's
not like it's going to go away in the
next couple weeks and that's something
that I hadn't heard mentioned a lot when
it comes to the initial reviews of this
card so something to consider - if
you're potentially interested also if
you're potentially interested you might
be interested in some gameplay so that's
what we're gonna do next
let's get that testbed system set up
all right guys we're actually starting
to do some gameplay now we're starting
with shadow of the Tomb Raider the
newest in the Tomb Raider series and
just so you guys know I'm using the
fastest computer ever which has a 9900 K
so that's our CPU that we're working
with and that's just running it stuck so
about 5 gigahertz max on a single core
right now we're at 2560 by 1440 but I'm
also going to test at 1080 in just a
minute we're in DirectX 12 mode and then
we also have the settings just set to
high basic is off so the top left corner
you should be able to see frames per
second in green you can also see the GPU
memory usage as a percentage as well as
overall total current fan speed and then
we've got the CPU performance metrics
the 9900 K as well as the GPU
performance metrics with the RX 590
guess I just gotta hold II and I'll jump
to my death nice no she's very strong to
Terrell hole through the rock eggs
yeah she's buff pausing all right guys
we're trying to move pretty quickly from
game to game here and just give you a
little taste of each one an idea of the
performance so right now we're not quite
hitting 60 frames per second which is
kind of where I want to be we are seeing
some tarrying we're getting right around
the 50 FPS range so I'm just gonna
switch over to 1080 and we'll see how we
do there I'm 90 hi I'm Laura you get XP
points what do you like I'll show your
character we've never played this I just
use this roulette the benchmark thing
yeah alright when we play the beginning
part we're at benchmark
I know everything Oh motion sensor
yeah it's like parkour run to the jungle
is they supposed to go this way I don't
know I think you gotta shoot guys
alright guys I think we should move on
but just to sort of sum up we're getting
around eighty to eighty-five frames per
second maybe dipping below that a little
bit depending on the environments and if
there's a lot of foliage and stuff going
on but definitely very playable at 1080
maybe a little bit tougher at 2560 by
1440 so you might want to turn down the
game settings but let's move on alright
guys moving on to some tough G little
player unknowns battlegrounds I haven't
doubled in this in a little while but to
start off we are at 2560 by 1440 once
again and we are at high settings yes
all just the standard overall quality
high settings across the board let's get
started
jump into a game and see what kind of
performance we get you have a mic they
can present chat I do not have a mic
there's no mic connected to this
computer on Emily the mics we're using
interconnected to different
oh yeah up there it's confusing when you
get multiple computers being captured
and like displayed over here even though
it's not being run on that content I'm
actually surprises pass 60 frames per
second to be honest I think is Edition
yeah now you're down to 60 frames so
there you go yeah yeah it can fluctuate
pretty significant sodium familiar with
no frame reason to these buildings 270
we hit up we did lose a little clock
speed there dropped from 1580 at 1525 I
did it again
are you know how to chat miss LOM had a
tea
now I can sit backwards he left them oh
no you gotta buggy I said we got two
buggies our team is actually pretty well
set up right now no oh yes do the
backpack reload forget to be one of
those Dan came in we can't pick up a
weapon I kind of like that as a future I
mean I think it would make sense if some
weapons drop that weapon you pick it up
again the yeah it makes sense if some
weapons are loaded in some work yeah and
the guy was right he's like uh what were
you guys playing I guess he is play this
game for a while let me look up out of
Chatham you got a helmet we would a
police vest awesome team
yeah control team you its jack I
remember that yeah I'm gonna switch
resolutions okay guys I'm gonna take a
brief moment here my team is doing quite
well we're getting mid-70s FPS dips
sometimes but that's been fairly
consistent which isn't too bad at all
but I'm gonna jump over to 1920 by 1080
and we'll see if we get any more frames
doing that when I just see a got did a
simple process this chat I mean you
could just look for like key bindings
backpack
yeah this is my answer it gave us a rush
based game so texting drink and place
equals judge so either use a Michael
don't play the okay doesn't your answer
there's just no sex chance I'll taste
yet it Oh huh well there you go okay all
right I want it kind of find on my
answer you're way over there
yeah it's tricking the player are we
gonna die soon gained up Death Zone but
we're done come
the Chiefs go
yeah I guess night oh supply job yeah
what could go wrong there way up to
there keep an eye up off someone's gonna
try snappy huh keep calling me too it's
a Molotov yeah I gotta quit the pan
so you can serious fuck I'm on fire
people are they help fairly try to shoot
them okay stay frosty in a test pool are
you get on a first-person view I kill
someone No Oh dad how do I pick them up
use No
and I suck at this I'm sorry get out how
do I pick up get up again fuck oh wow
there you go f oh there we go sorry
sorry okay like I said thought I'd know
how to do this sorry as I say why your
vise is dead you go there
oh no default you got a shot I feel bad
it's okay fuck I thought it's cuz when I
first went up to my son I gonna press f
it didn't light up I didn't seem like it
I'm sorry
I died after being no help to my team at
all so let's move on next game on the
list guys is called duty black ops for
cops for so I'm gonna play the battle
royale again because that appears to be
fun sometimes
I'm gonna start out at 2560 by 1440 once
again and I'll switch to 1080 in just
two minutes
and as for details and textures we're
very high and then high for most of the
other stuff so there's a quick look at
those same goes for shadow qualities
let's get started and deploy how are
they so far away there's a dude in a
helicopter one of my one of my teammates
is in a helicopter
my whole team is in a helicopter I'm
running with bandages they can't are
they coming to get me Kenzie just
chopped off with nukes of it and they're
pretty far well they totally ditched her
ass when I leave something bad when
you're running through fields you guys
speak to see in frames per second
anything is I better pick me up because
if not I'm running away from the
collapsing field thing
Oh can't go in the car ah well we're
dying now
coming
that's cool I'm a helicopter made up to
the chopper guys Oh frame rate it was
pretty solid well over the 70 up in the
70s I will say with the chopper and lots
of movement going on right now we're
getting we're dropping down a bit but
when we're on the ground it's a little
bit higher than now are we is he flying
yes yeah okay picks your bone I'm just
flying along the edge of the zone oh
there you go you can see let's go you
can see like the bullets not again yeah
keep our first person resume it yeah I
might hope well I have ammo this time
around well I guess that is the downside
hey yeah I don't feel bad being blown on
by a rocket at least it's actually
pretty cool I guess we're expecting
extra bone right now to get a little bit
more gameplay footage and maybe see
someone play who's better at this game
than I am we'd have a nice jump in frame
rate going from 2560 by 1440 to 1920 by
1080 so it is a way that you can get
more frames or if you're playing unlike
in 1920 by 1080 freesync monitor this is
probably a good example of kind of what
you might expect but I think that's
probably about all the time we have for
this game and we should probably move on
jumping into overwatch next we got the
new update with Ashe the newest DPS hero
available real quickly again gonna start
but at 2560 by 1440 and then I'll let
you guys know when I switch to 1080
other than that we're using the ultra
presets and I have turned off the frame
rate cap so let's jump into a game and
say yeah we do so you could defend that
statute we have to keep them from
getting up there further this is just a
choke point there's no friendly fire
right no I have bubbles though I can
vocal people so when they die in front
of me seems like that
a purple bubble huh let's to see the
counter in the middle of the screen yeah
94 93 that's my charge whenever I put a
bubble on me or somebody else if it
absorbs damage it increases my church oh
I shouldn't
so keeping my charge maxed is very
helpful for my offensive abilities
because it greatly increases my damage
output
can you see you inducing that say get a
fast pace King it can be yeah but frame
rate of a giddy I'm not even paying
attention to any of this 189 80 frames
per second that's that's quick again
it's it's solid no I wanted that's good
timing in a bubble that that dragon you
just shot out should it totally killed
me this is where they're actually trying
to go right now yeah yeah this is the
capture point they're trying to get to
so they need to get there and stand
there until it turns over and becomes
there's ice and then after that it turns
into an escort right now we're actually
pretty well here okay dragon thank you
wait up
oh yes yeah yep be careful chill do you
master but if I come master
we went and on Blizzard world we're
solidly getting in the 80 frames per
second range at 2560 by 1440 with our RX
590 pretty solid let's strain it around
and I'm gonna switch to 1080 oh we can
do 120 see what the old gato thinks of
that yo gato has no problem with that
Thank You El Gato brigita so what's that
was a mission on this we got to get up
there and there's a oh that's a great
great idea Alpha Al Pacino
okay keen oh that's such a cool name for
a character no I kick your ass ball yeah
I mean just cuz I'm a healer doesn't
mean I can't beat it
you shooting me you shooting me no
nobody shoot
get a people huh I can heal - hey gotta
go what come on fired it's why I like
her cuz she has a shield - so she's
she's a little tanky for a battle plan
for a support character yeah she has no
movement abilities it's one or the other
yeah Wow
there's a turret oh look your turret
can't hit here difficut I'll just stand
here and capture Hey
oh I almost killed her Oh
just update frame rate we're getting a
close to hundred frames per second maybe
just a little bit under na this is
nineties way if it's any to use yeah oh
yeah shielded Bob we won look like what
a great way to end my overwatch gameplay
we got one more game left to play
that's fortnight love it or hate it
we're gonna try it all right guys our
last game is fortnight for better for
worse and just to take a look at
settings 2560 by 1440 once again to
start maxed out the 3d resolution so
we're rendering it the same resolution
that we're displaying at unlimited
framerate I've gotten with the high
default vsync is off and that's pretty
much all so let's get er let's get
started
oh yeah teams yeah wait how do you think
the bus driver Paul is not faking the
bus driver guys does she do that in the
comments to meets he goes one was your
name on this skip Oh Paul Pollack yeah
it's pretty straightforward Paul did not
think the bus driver can I believe he's
just I'm sorry I don't know how to think
the bus driver can't like how I don't
know pick up a dude in table G it's the
shiny bits over here
Plus halo there's the chess with the pop
oh Jesus died that's what happens for we
don't think the bus ridership so it is
shoot him
kill them kill them Roger Roger crawl
into the water to hide no I died all
right oh I suck it for tonight
hey what difference between like this
and watch game it's it's kind of the the
story of like did you land on top of a
weapon no did you encounter someone else
who did yes on the plus side though I
can watch this person and their buggy
which apparently has a rocket engine on
the back Wow Wow kids how far this game
has come all right guys I've jumped over
to 1920 by 1080 also in full-screen mode
now please bear in mind the game before
this was window full screen which might
have a small impact on the framerate but
it shouldn't be too significant in
either case I think I'm gonna get much
better fps and maybe I won't die as
quickly and 1920 by 1080 but I was out
it's getting angry huh
yeah fan speeds at 77% Wow
it's also ambient temperature in here
has gotten warmer we've been dumping a
lot of heat in the garage think about
this mike is right next to like the
computer you think it's gonna pick up
noise maybe huh possibly all right uh
well shit that's right though Joe you
know how to get rid of that someone oh
wow there's me though guess your net
all right we're back in the bus there
you go
I thank the bus driver as everyone share
that that is everyone just always
gravitate towards the Luxor lights what
do you think like a pin like the area
were they gonna go when that's what you
see oh yeah oh that's my teammates to my
teammates put those down like how their
teams can't see that makes some sense
well that's good thinking fuck I got a
gun
yeah no excuse to take away what hassles
Wow your team got slaughtered no it's
like feel like we dropped down into a
busy area over here this many of my team
alive oh yes yes no he put up a wall how
how smart he built a whole wall around
me so he could revive me Thank You red
blue red el 63 whitey get up son
okay okay have a really nice sniper
rifle there you go right there
shit Ambo it's quite a reload time
today so that's a pretty impractical
weapon I had I feel like oh look at that
told you it was their use yeah here here
yeah here you can use it it's coming
yeah and it's not aware of that at all
and should I try to play again there is
that let me try a game Jill's gonna try
thanks guys I like that idea
it makes things happen it's been saying
a lot guys gonna watch this evade his
game so that's good yeah sure I think I
remember once what as long as I kill a
guy I probably feel proud of myself yeah
that sniper rifle was really nice but
not in that situation kind of follow
these guys here can't lava can't live
there I'm following you far far far far
far do doopy doopy doopy tip tomorrow
as you start destroying things it'll pop
up little dots on it
no nice again no you know it's funny
what's funny popular well the headset
does have a mic how do you what you can
adjust your weapons right if we guy you
do that to do to do what you can adjust
your weapons tab probably a more Iife
rate venturi Wow this computers really
hot huh yeah even you're warm this is
something you're sitting right where the
exhaust is fine yeah still this you know
I feel the heat
nup job nice is no longer shit am i
seared knocked out but oh I throw a
grenade at him so you did a better job
to meet you and I guess that about wraps
it up for for tonight as well
just to recap we're getting in the low
hundreds hundreds frames per seconds at
1080 1080 and then easily up above 70 at
2560 by 1440 not too bad so there you
have it guys some gameplay footage with
this new graphics card from AMD the
Radeon rx 590 I personally am glad this
card exists because I'd rather it be
there than not but I also totally agree
that it does seem a little bit
overpriced at 280 bucks I think if just
a bit of a price reduction not around
the $250 range and I think AMD would
really have a winner with this one and
you have maybe a little bit more
interest especially when you consider
that if you wanted to pair this with the
free sync monitor especially a 2560 by
1440 monitor like as demonstrating some
gameplay with today of it's gonna cost
you less you can get those for around
300 to 400 dollars whereas Nvidia
options typically start around 500 bucks
so that is something to consider along
with of course that pretty cool game
bundle that's offered as well anyway
though I will post links to this card as
well as some other ones down in the
description below if you guys enjoyed
this video definitely hit the thumbs up
button and let me know what you think of
the captured gameplay footage now that I
have the entire captured PC up and
running I am very happy that that is the
case and I can capture high resolution
than 1080 so I hope you guys have
enjoyed that as well
thanks again for watching this video
though and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
