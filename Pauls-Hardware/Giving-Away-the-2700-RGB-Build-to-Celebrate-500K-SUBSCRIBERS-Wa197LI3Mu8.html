subscriber Thank You giveaway video so
let me start right from the top by
saying thank you to all of you guys who
have subscribed to my channel whether
you're new subscriber whether you've
been subscribing since back when I first
started this many years ago and I think
it's 2012 when I actually originally
started my channel thank you guys I'm a
half a million I never thought I would
get this far but I'm going to keep
making videos and I'm going to keep
giving back to you guys whenever I can
so actually last week I did a 500
thousand subscriber casual livestream
where I just I played some games and
stuff and I did some shots and it was
pretty terrible and all that stuff but I
had fun and thanks like anyone who tuned
in for that and I did have some
questions posted down in the comments to
help determine what the actual giveaway
should be because of course of course
I'm going to do a giveaway and I decided
that since I build computers on my
channel I should probably give away a
computer that I've built so first
question was what CPU should the
giveaway be based on and it was a very
tight race between the 70 to 100 K and
are on the rise in seven seventeen
hundred seventy seven hundred K one out
again very very slim margin so I will be
going with the 7700 K and actually I
went and bought one from Micro Center
just the other day because the only one
that I have right now is an engineering
sample I don't like to give away
engineering samples so here's the retail
box for whoever the winner might end up
being and then also what motherboard
manufacturer should we go with a to s1
this by a pretty significant margin so
good job Asus apparently your marketing
is going well at least for this
particular platform so 7700 Canon asus
motherboard what case should we use your
results with fantex
followed up closely by NZXT corsair
fractally Emily and coolant master but
fantex won this one with 21% of the
votes and then the final question
RGB yes or no and about 2/3 of you
definitely want RGB and all the things
so I don't I don't know what to do I
mean we need we need a fan text case we
need an asus motherboard we needed 7700
K based system so probably BG 270 and
RGB scene
III don't know I just I don't know no
you get this guy's that's my that's my
classy RGB builds that is my January
system of the month I put it again look
at it back there it's it's beautiful
that's what you guys you never want that
ah yes the RGB builds and I don't I
don't know whether to laugh or cry now
because this obviously represents the
pinnacle of technological achievement
that can be accomplished accomplished
right now with PC building I mean arise
and of course notwithstanding there's
some arguments that can be made there
but look at it we have a system which is
incredibly powerful if you want to do
gaming what if you do anything else
total retail cost of all the parts that
are included here is right around $2,700
of course right now it's sporting the
springtime color scheme which is which
is paired up nicely with an SEO somebody
background sorry I'm not giving you a
predator x34 that's that's staying with
me but you will get pretty much this
entire system right here I do need to
get some shoutouts to some of the
vendors who provided parts for this
build
they did not provide the parts for the
giveaway I kind of let them know that
after the fact but apart from the CPU
that I purchased the parts that are
involved here are going to be the case
of course which is the fan text and to
evolve tempered glass and then to the
vault peih-gee has RGB accents on the
power button on the top as well as done
on the front and those have been wired
up with the motherboard so they can be
coordinated with the RGB lighting as you
can see making a lovely transition
between I pretty much did a yellow to
blue transition right here which gives a
very nice springtime color scheme but
that's also a good way of syncing the
lights elsewhere in the case which is
everything except for the NZXT crack in
X 62 which has its own NZXT cam software
to handle it but yeah that way
everything looks like it's all
synchronized even though these are being
handled by two separate softwares so
just to rattle out the parts you real
quick so of course 7700 K CPU under
there NZXT crack in X 62 CPU cooler the
fantex and to evolved temper
glass case motherboard back there's from
Asus as well as the graphics card so
that is the Maximus 9 hero motherboard
which is a z2 70 chipset board which has
been doing a wonderful job so far the
graphics card is the asus rog Strix GT x
1080 also with RGB trim and man I guess
I love this color scheme having like I
finally played around with it more and I
got this lined up and gosh it looks
beautiful anyway say apart from that
1080 we have the g.skill this is a very
highly sought after item right here by
the way g.skill tried NZ r GB memory
again just just beautiful with the RGB
colors there and all classy too right
doesn't look garish doesn't doesn't look
ugly or anything like that it's like hey
this is how LED lighting should be we
have LED lighting there are some LED
strips down at the bottom and then up on
the side here those are also from fan
tech so those also sync up with the case
in the rest of the lighting our storage
comes from Toshiba this is the OCZ Rd
400 one terabyte SSD like God and that's
at $700 a piece of this equipment of
this system right here so that's
actually probably one of the most
expensive pieces in here yeah actually
that is I think so that's that's
interesting too and that's for power
supply we have the EVGA 750 g2 not just
that wonderful 80 plus gold rated power
supply from EVGA but also they're very
nicely done sleeves cable kits which
came along as well and of course that
has been integrated and everything's
plugged in and working and then rounding
out everything there's also a 480 gig
ocz try on 150 SSD that's tucked away in
the back so there's about one and a half
terabytes of all solid-state storage in
the system and then finally I will be
doing a Windows of Windows 10 license so
you'll get you get full Windows 10 setup
and activated on here as well alright so
I guess that's what you guys want I did
ask you guys for the feedback so we are
giving away the classy RGB build with
all the parts that I just talked about
now
really

international audience because I am
splitting up this giveaway I am making
it international but the prize itself

cost of the system just to accept
delivery for it in some countries
