useful oh yeah
tweet it bro keep forgetting which Mouse
is which hello everyone who is watching
us live whether you're watching us live
or whether you're watching us in the
future
hello and welcome to awesome hardware
this is a technology live show which we
broadcast simultaneously to twitch and
YouTube and usually we do the show on
Tuesday evenings at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
however today we're doing the show on
Wednesday and we started it like noon or
like 12:30 why why did we do that Kyle
because we're going to copy text Paul
well first off you're going to kind of
be Texan like couple hours and then
you're going to fly the Taiwan in a
couple hours and then while I sound
really drunk right now um I got that
wagon in the lazy mode okay so you're
flying you're getting on a plane to
Taiwan in a couple hours yep and I just
got back from Hawaii from a family
vacation last night that's true so this
really made the most sense for both of
us so we're endeavoring to not let you
guys go too long without a live show we
didn't want to go like a month in
between so that's why we did sort of a
weird off episode here on Wednesday but
it's cool we're still drinking some beer
it's still even though it's midday and
we're you've been having a good time I
just finished Kyle's half so if you
didn't catch that you can check that out
via the link in the description we
talked about stuff cuz if it was good
good we did some some what we do and I
forget didn't hit my PC depend my PC we
did defender time not fund talk about
some tech news yeah um
really quick at the beginning of the
show oh you know I forgot hold on I want
to talk about your giveaway if you don't
add up of course yeah cuz I forgot to
bring that up if you guys aren't aware
Kyle is giving away a computer a
strategically it's a very strategic
giveaway yes coincides right with the
scapular just kept yours I was not at
all a coincidence McConnell is giving
away like a $2,000 system no so I
checked that out over and over in his
channel it's crazy
um the link is not in my description
right now I'll see if I can put it in
the
but if not it's in his description
$2,000 system enter to win is it
international yes it's international
it's gonna be awesome
so do that yes in the meantime if you
guys would like to help support our us
us the things we do even further by
stuff on our stores Cal stores
biblioth√®que slash store sure it's mugs
pint glasses these all very high quality
gear and also you can order stuff from
my store if you order during the show
we'll give you guys a big old shout out
towards the end yeah and my store is at
Paul's hardware nets also shirts I've
got some lady shirts to get some decals
got some beanies polo shirts as well as
of course the lovely glasses we're
drinking out of Imperial pint glasses
they're super great alright that's how
we begin the show oh wait no that's kind
of how you begin the show we're drinking
more beer too I've moved on to a
Lagunitas little sub this is a some of
the beer that we picked up the other
week for preview show I think Paul's
still going on working on the great
white working on the great white follows
coast both good options so cheers to you
guys
thanks you guys for being here happy to
be drinking of you know legal drinking
age then that it's been submitted to
pleasure of drinking looking and always
responsibly
mmm-hmm midday midday on Wednesday
midday responsibly that's that's right
yep as I sorry I remember as I said that
I pulled up our stream for like 30
seconds ago just me it's me like holding
one beers I finish this drink ease
respectfully yeah it's okay okay
is that you know that's the one thing
that you look forward to tonight is
you'll be at an airport where there's no
judgement of drinking at any Saturday
and it brings any time anyone can drink
at an airport socially acceptable it's
not really weird that's very pretty I
was leaving from Ontario like a few
weeks ago and it was like 9 a.m. and I
walked through in this bar there's like
four people
yeah bar yep I am no judgment whatsoever
but hey no one bats an eye it's normal
yep alright we're gonna get right back
into some tech news because there's
certainly plenty of it going around yes
thanks not in a little part due to the
fact Computex
this coming week so lots of tech
launches happen at Computex all right
sell also sell thanks for moderating
today and he's pointing out the nitrogen
obtained so that's my excuse
Kalos excuse was that he was on vacation
last week it was that's an excuse right
yeah okay Marlys I was forced forced to
go to Hawaii
enjoy the tropics about a week ago
actually on Tuesday last week and we
didn't do the show last week so we
haven't talked about it much
AMD announced Rison thread Ripper read
Ripper they actually announced thread
Ripper as well as epic these are going
to be what appears to be an enthusiast
class ship on a new socket designed to
compete with Intel's highest high-end
desktop offerings x99 are potentially
the upcoming X 299 that's rumored and
epic appears to be a a up to 64 core 128
thread CPU like with it's just crazy
it's crazy the amount of cores and stuff
they got going on and that's going to
compete with Intel's high and Xeon stuff
right but as the intimate Abul garden
points out here the executive editor at
PC world there really is a very minimal
amount of information that we actually
know for sure what we actually know for
sure about thread Ripper is that there
is a thread Ripper CPU it has 16 cores
and 32 threads and it releases in the
summer of 2017 that's all that AMD is
confirmed so beyond that anything else
you hear the rumor is rumor or
speculation so just want to point that
out we should right out of the gate as
we talk about this stuff you know so um
but of course there is rumor and
speculation so we're still going to
mention some of that stuff but first off
our nine we have rise in three rise in
five and risin 9 I'm sorry rise in three
rise in five and rise in seven confirmed
by AMD there's discussion that there
going to be a rise in 9 in this high-end
desktop platform that they're talking
about AMD did not mention the number 9
at all it was not said so it could still
be classified as a right
9 we're not sure that AMD hasn't said
that all they've called it is Andy risin
thread river which is a kind of a funny
sounding name actually makes me think of
like like a fart Ripper
yeah like bending over your pants that
are too tight and then your threads just
written that's the thread Ripper but
maybe that's the meadows the intent
that's what they want it's got too much
power to in it so it's bursting at the
seams slows through your pants I don't
know just second Julius really Mudbugs
fart you've been hanging on to for two
months needing nothing but Mexican food
after a fiesta
I don't know as obviously what they're
aiming for with this so no nine is
mentioned now other rumors have included
an increased memory bandwidth capability
by me by way of a quad channel
controller which could be very
interesting considering how much effects
memory speed has had on existing rise in
performance for the desktop processors
that are already out that could be very
interesting to thing to to exist there's
also speculation that's not just a 16
core 32 thread part would make sense but
also potentially a 14 core or 12 core or
10 core part would also make a lot of
sense but again that's a rumor different
price points more rumors all versions of
the Rison 9 would feature 44 PCI Express
links well that could be interesting
nice
that's also the rumored number of PCI
Express Lanes that the next 299 intel
skylake XK be like X kylieqq X I got a
case would have yeah so it would be
competitive there but we don't know that
for sure
quad channel RAM support of course yeah
yeah I already said quad channel ray I'm
sorry sorry
two chipsets X 390 and X 3 99 that would
make some sense I guess from a branding
perspective and then also that the
socket which is succat sp3 which would
be a four thousand ninety four pin
socket so really massive socket and
potentially LGA
so who knows model numbers they're
talking about would be in the 1900
series so like right now we have 1800 XS
the highest-end risin 7 cpu so you have
1900 X or there abouts the 10 core
against there speculating would be a
risin 9 1955 and the top-end 16 core
would be the risin 9 1998 X 1998 see
that's an interesting number cuz now
you're getting close to like actual
years that we've like yeah maybe that a
retro chip
yeah does it come with like far cry 3
Blood Dragon back in 98 I mean I'm gonna
talk about 98 right now come with that I
don't know and then come Theory DVD
included that would be sweet see yeah
they should team up with 99 DX robo
competition rebranding also rumor mills
put the thermals at 155 watt TDP for the
top-end part and 125 watts EDP down at
the bottom for say a 10 core 125 watt
TDP for a 10 core chip that sounds
perfectly fine by me
heck 155 watt TDP for a 16 quart 32
thread ship also sounds pretty awesome
to me yeah so again guys there's tons of
stuff just kind of bouncing around right
here in the rumor sphere so take it all
with a grain of salt but some I'm sure
some of it at least might be more geared
towards what might actually happen and
then of course there are rumors going
around right now about what thread
Ripper might go up against talked about
this a bit on Kyle's half of the show
but X 299 potentially is the chipset
that Intel might be launching to go
along with their new potentially core i9
again all this stuff is really really
not sure yet so hopefully we'll be able
to bring us some more confirmation in
the next next week or so as we visit
Computex in person and get you guys the
story from on the ground and all that
stuff yeah cool all right over on the
server side AMD has officially given a
brand name to their what has previously
been codenamed Naples which is
the server iteration of the processors
that use their Zen microarchitecture
which then is used in Rison processors
on the consumer side right now so on the
desk I'm sorry on the server side you'll
have AMD epic ep YC is how it's spelled
like replacing vowels with wise yeah
Rison epic and but here we have a friend
this was actually at AMD's Financial
Analysts day and here we have Lisa sue
actually holding up a name the epic chip
you'll notice it's huge yeah four
fingers good four fingers across yeah so
four fingers out it's pretty wide so
here's where there's a lot of
speculation as to like is epic going to
use the same socket that that that
thread Ripper uses that high-end desktop
platform is is it going to be similar to
that this does look like an LG a chip
not a PGA chip yeah
from from what I've seen I do not know
if there's any pictures of the other
side of that from the events I haven't
had enough time to really dig in and see
if there's any further than that but
them what AMD did announce and confirm
for sure at their financial analyst day
is well first they're very much
targeting the Xeon lineup that Intel
currently has because the Intel
currently dominates the server markets
but this ship would have up 228 PCI
Express 3.0 lanes which is absolutely
the same the chips will scale all the
way up to the 30 32 core 64 thread chip
that Lisa is holding right here and
would support 8 channel ddr4 memory with
up the 16 dimms per CPU allowing up to 4
terabytes of total memory per socket
which is pretty impressive infinity
fabric is what AMD is going to be using
to tie all of these together infinity
fabric is already in place in the rising
chips they're going to use an affinity
fabric to communicate between Vega GPUs
and the CPUs and they're also going to
use it to communicate between different
CPUs in a multi sockets environment like
you have in an
enterprise configuration so that's cool
this is rumor so just again trying to
distinguish what is announced versus
what's worried but it's rumored to scale
from as little as 30 gigabytes per
second up to 512 gigabytes per second uh
and as far as the infinite infinity
fabric communication between chips which
is absolutely insane which but would be
what would be necessary if you wanted to
maintain scalability while you're just
adding more and more cores via adding
more and more processors so that's kind
of exciting to see what actual
performance they're able to get out of
that and of course like we already
mentioned they're developing their GPUs
along with this at AI acceleration as
well as machine learning they're trying
to help to develop both of these in
tandem with each other so that the CPU
side and the GPU side can both work
together and mix workload environments
to maximize just the raw computing
performance you can get and I imagine
scalability is of course huge in there
that's that's really what they talk
about with this is they want to be able
to just pile stuff on which really makes
sense when you take what they did with
Rison and the different SMT units that
make up horizon processor and just sort
of building that out as they add more
and more on there uh also on or also
discussed I guess a little bit at this
event is their roadmap and we briefly
discuss this on Kyle's half which is
that right now they have Zen in 2017
which is based on 14 nanometer
architecture and they've talked about 40
nanometer plus architecture a
refinements of 14 nanometer Zen to their
saying is going to be based on the 7
nanometer architecture and then 3 is
going to be based on a refinement of
that they're targeting these for 2018
through 2020 so Andy's definitely not
letting up when it comes to their
development of CPUs at least on the CPU
side is what this is mainly discussing
which is good news for all of us who
have been excited to see a lot more
competition in that space in the past
few months cool
yes I'm excited about that on the server
side actually because I don't know
servers just have that that sort of raw
power feel to them so I'm curious to see
if AMD's got anything going on a
supercomputer like sense right because I
feel like that's that's kind of the
crowning achievements of a lot of the
the hardware developers like Nvidia the
super-proud I mean like they named all
of their Titan graphics cards after the
Titan supercomputer that's based on on
their architecture so it'd be
interesting to see if AMD has anything
like that in the works honestly that's
something that just popped into my head
right now I have no basis for that epic
would be a pretty good name for a
supercomputer
I mean if it really scales it like
they're talking about and if the
Infinity fabric is really able to help
all those difference you know rock
computing elements work together then
that seems like there's a lot of
potential day so this mean epic is also
going to see a pretty decent boost from
higher memory speeds probably right if
it's going to work the same way
infinity fabric on the rise inside and
it runs at the same frequency as
whatever memory frequency you set so I'm
not sure what going from dual channel
the quad channel would affect with
something like that right but certainly
being able to run higher memory
frequencies seems to really be the the
bread and butter of getting more
performance out of that platform so yeah
I mean as they refine the the process
and as they come out with new new newer
chips they should theoretically be able
to support higher memory frequencies
right which should theoretically improve
performance of a scale infinity fabric
up to to improve how everything works as
a hive mind yeah so to speak be
interesting like we could see maybe
you know for once memory speeds could
affect like render times for video
editing and things like that
with infinity fabric yes before that's
it's not it's more of the the capacity
of memory that's been more important
than the actual frequency but infinity
fabric could potentially change some of
that which which I'm totally fine with I
mean it yeah it it adds another way to
potentially upgrade the performance of
your system over time yeah and what's
easier than swapping out a memory kit
yeah exactly so yeah I mean it's nice to
be able to tell people yet you can build
your system right now get a get a budget
memory kit you know twenty four hundred
speed or something like that and then
you know a few months down the line you
can upgrade it or something or wait for
Andy to release release a new ad ISA or
whatever
microcode for the chip and then you can
you can actually run with higher speed
memory and then you can upgrade down the
line right so yeah I think all that's
good people in chat the noise in the
background it's probably Hiro snoring
yeah that's our hero snoring because
he's right down here or if there's a low
rumbling sound at the Train or at the
tree which could be running by um all
right now let's move on to Vega yeah yes
Vega alright so again a lot of you guys
have probably already seen some of this
stuff cuz a kit did come out about him
about a week ago right now that's the
wrong one this is Vega cuz it came out
about a week ago but it's very important
information and and stuff so of course
we need to discuss it briefly this is a
PC world article by Brad sharkus was
that no no okay so so we have a little
bit more information about Vega
specifically in the demonstration of the
founders Edition Vega frontier Edition
Vega cards I almost called the founders
Edition how silly of me is getting so
close with diversity met that mistake
there so yeah they've run out of ID so
clearly frontier edition that sounds
Frontier edition that sounds like a like
a place in Disneyland like frontier land
it does for a glint happen to your land
okay so the thing so here's use the card
demo they showed that honestly I'm
totally done with this this is fine with
me I
two completely different color scheme
than you typically saloon gold and a PC
it's blue and gold it's got this little
LED thing in the corner I know it's not
going to match with a huge huge number
of existing PC parts Oh but it's a
little bit different and I don't mind
the look with the brush metal and the
sort of inverse blue and gold with the
Vega and Radeon logo I think it's okay
came from so here's the full gold
version with the included closed-loop
water cooling for it this was just weird
to see a blue AMD card yeah that's
because they're so red and AMD like I
associate blue you know with Intel I
don't know I guess I should I should
hate this color scheme because it's kind
of like UCLA and UCLA a terrible
terrible place yeah where's your USC
pride where no one no one should ever go
or visit treater horrible school but
anyway there it is so the frontier
edition is the first graphics card based
on Vega architecture which of course
people have been talking about for
months and we've been talking about and
everyone's excited about and super but
then they're like hey here's the
frontier edition how could we like give
you guys a reveal that is more slightly
disappointing than this basically an
under clocked card designed for for data
scientists immersion engineers and
product designers rather than gamers
which great there is a small portion of
the population it's like sweet I'm one
of those people yeah and then there's
all these gamers who have been waiting
for this we're like yeah so of course
some of the first questions asked by
Raja Kaduri at this read it was a reddit
AMA that he did was when did we get the
gaming version of this so it's what
anyone is still coming they said there's
more about the Vega version the Vega for
gamers graphics card which will be
revealed at Computex this next week so
again more reasons for you guys to
subscribe to our YouTube channel so you
find out all information hey someone
suggested maybe we do a gold PC and a
follow up gold oh yeah there's a gold
build yeah that'd be cool Gold bill
would be sweet with the gold build was a
classic I still I still thoroughly enjoy
that video yeah
it's probably worth a lot now that'd be
cool yeah that was a giveaway system I
wonder who yeah I wonder whoever won
that still has that um they look
upgraded since then but yeah so Vega
will not be on store shelves the week of
Computex just to point this out
although Andy is doing a press event on
May 31st at 10:00 a.m. Taipei time
which apparently I haven't been invited
to yet I need the mocha bout that I
better that to what this press event
they're doing it may 31st at 10:00 a.m.
that's Tuesday actually I probably can't
go to it cuz I've got other stuff
doesn't matter I'll still visit AMD at
Computex soon and do that stuff anyway
so they are doing a press event which
typically they have been live-streaming
recently so you guys might be able to
catch it from over here in the state's
10:00 p.m. Eastern 7 p.m. Pacific on May
31st I'm sorry it would be May 30th over
here yeah it'll be May 30th 10 p.m.
Eastern 7 p.m. Pacific yeah so Monday
nights you guys go check out an AMD is
going to be doing livestream where they
might talk more stuff about Vega won't
be on store shelves the week of Computex
by any means but they did show the
sniper I'm sorry the Vega frontier
edition running Sniper Elite for between
60 and 70 frames per second at 4k Raja
stressed that they're really trying to
hit that 4k 60 frames per second barrier
with Vega with modern titles I hope so
he also confirmed that the 16 gig
frontier Edition is going to have two
stacks of HBM to memory with eight gigs
each rather than four 4 gig stacks of
HBM to memory so that's a thing - he was
questioned about potential yield issues
with HP m2 because that was something
that helped back the launch of the
feejee cards they were very difficult to
find for quite a while he downplayed
that but who knows what's actually gonna
happen anyway all things said we're
still they've still promised a q2
release of Vega so that gives them the
entire month of June to launch something
ok cool it's not really for a very
taxing game do you know there's a
benchmark that's part of it
yeah I mean it's an it's a I forgive it
it's a forgiving engine it's based on
but it's based on one of the high-end
engines be interesting to see like what
and real high but I'm totally I could
totally be wrong about that and pulled
that out of my ass the interesting you
see like what a GTX 1080 or 1080i does
in that game at 4k yeah and if it's
between 60 or 70 frames per cycle you
could probably sort of estimate how
powerful that Vega GPUs let's get a lot
of the speculation about Vega is how
powerful it's going to be when it
actually launches and there's been
everything from saying it's going to
rival the 1080 TI - it's going to rival
the 1070 yep and I could leave a pretty
wide range with a pretty wide range and
I can see landing anywhere in between
there so we're not going to know until
there's cards out there in people's
hands and independent reviews and all
that stuff so it goes all right if you
got a Samsung Galaxy s8 and you've got
that iris feature that Jesus iris uses
your eyes unlock to unlock it which is
just that the height of security and
keeping your phone secure and everything
it's already been hacked so don't trust
it all you need apparently is a laser
printer ironically Samsung laser
printers seems to work very well laser
printer you need a picture of the
person's eye that's a relatively
reasonable resolution why is it so loud
it's like that's pretty much this may
you just need one eye yeah well you know
anyone I Atlit but granted that's also
easily attainable for most people who
post pictures on social media and then
you need a contact lens and you put the
contact lens over the picture the
printed picture and then you can fool
the iris scanner into letting you into
unlocking the phone we put an actual
contact lens over the paper
I believe that's what he does yes just
to make it like this curvature mores
yeah it's it's excise so look yeah so
let's say you're spearing us yeah it's
to make it look like a real eye with the
proper reflection of it so to figure
this out
sighs just holding the piece of paper up
eh and the phone's will not Wow cool
okay but I mean
so I get it but my time I do that who's
gonna do that
who's gonna like I mean is it that easy
for someone to get that clear and that
close of a picture of your eye
people post selfies of their face all
the time I guess you're right everywhere
then did it say how detailed the photo
has to be cuz if there's like a 5d mark
ii from two inches away that's different
than a selfie that you take post on
facebook with compression and but
if that is the case then that's that's
pretty very much right so here's here's
the picture he took oh yeah with not a
very nice camera yeah okay he zooms in
up to there a photo for medium distance
is sufficient okay well then there you
go then that's that's pretty easy to do
cool you can just pull that Haley zooms
it in we zoomed it in with some editing
software it looks like he's using GIMP
or something like that yeah printed out
with a laser printer so it needs to be a
printer with a reasonable that can
handle reasonable resolution good lord
no it should use any money unlocks it
hey so yep I'm convinced just boys I
mean this is an emerging and emerging
market of biometric security with
portable devices which is on the one
hand a very useful thing I mean I use
fingerprint unlocking for my phone all
the time and I always think like well
that's either a very difficult thing to
break or the easiest thing in the world
to break if I've just been knocked out
by a mugger and I'm lying there
unconscious on the streets they can just
take my finger and put it up in there
and unlock my phone or something like
that is the RFID implant that came got
at LAN Syndicate last year right I mean
that that is the next step of this kind
of thing your body much much much more
difficult to defeat or something like
that I know the next time you see Kane
he's gonna have like his arm chopped off
yeah well yeah some guy really wanted
time off you want to get in my apartment
you need alright so there it is no don't
trust the fake news don't trust the iris
unlock my eyes alright I've been trying
to keep up with this at least once a
week and we talked about this net
neutrality it's under attack I'm gonna
I'm gonna go over this really quickly
because I don't want to hammer on it too
much but if you're not already aware
comments are currently open so net
neutrality rules have been challenged
these
net neutrality rules that were put in
place back in 2015 they've been in place
for a year and a half or so and if you
ask most people they're doing just fine
keeping all the packets going to and fro
across the internet neutral so they
can't be handled or mishandled by an
Internet service provider they can't be
blocked or throttled or slowed down or
anything like that
ajit pi and the current ephesus FCC want
to roll that back to give Internet
service providers whether it's a can
Wired service or wireless service more
leeway in controlling the data that
comes to and from you most people like
the vast majority of people think this
is a bad idea we're okay with the
internet just being neutral wherever you
go whatever website you go to get the
data and and and that's where it comes
back to however unsurprisingly they
voted on the initial notice of proposed
rulemaking which was rolled out 2-3
weeks ago and they voted along party
lines two to one and they have voted to
take this to the next phase which is
that they have crystallized rules and
they are now accepting further
commentary though so what everyone needs
to do is go to the FCC's website post a
comment how you do not think that
rolling back title to control over ISPs
is a good idea how you feel all data
packets should be traded he treated
equally and that you do not agree with
his action granted they might ignore you
and and go ahead and do whatever the
hell they want to anyway however it's
important that people speak out right
now so that at least when they ignore
everyone we can say hey this isn't what
we wanted you to do and beyond that it
will be more down to going to the voting
booth and that kind of thing however for
the time being thanks to John Oliver and
the folks over at last week tonight you
can go to go FCC yourself comm geo FCC
yourself calm and it will take you
directly to the page on the FCC website
where you can submit a new filing and it
can go in there enter and upload a text
file of your statements bear in mind
that when you make this post it is
publicly viewable by
anyone on the internet so keep that in
mind however that's important because
there have been a ton of apparently
erroneous filings made that all have the
same statement in them and everything
like that this is something that I was
going to delve into a little bit further
but suffice to say that there's people
who are using technology to try to
subvert this process but the more actual
people there are commenting with unique
comments the better of a situation we're
going to be in and screw anyone who's
trying to subvert this process by using
bots or anything like that
so they're easily bots for knaves to
position themselves against is basically
yes they're using bots to submit
comments with the names and addresses of
real people so that I let's see if I can
actually do this or not hold on uh what
was it called was it called
so no ha no one's making BOTS in favor
of net neutrality I'm not sure these are
all misery I guess I can't say that for
sure or not uh Comcast or Turks that's
it is um so there's lots of um
accusations going on right now about
potentially the Internet service
providers doing shady things to try to
make it look like there's more comments
in support of rolling back title 2 um
but if you are not sure if you have not
commented but you think somewhat but
basically a lot of comments have been
made in people's names with using their
names and addresses taken from some
separate unknown unknown database and
post it in their names so if you go to
Comcast rotor comm WW Comcast rotor comm
you can punch in your name and see if
your name has been used in an FCC
submission on this whoa
ok let's browse that database and tell
you so that's a good way to figure out
if you haven't made a comments well has
my information has someone made a
comments on my behalf using my
information absolutely that's kind of
lame and and those comments that have
been submitted are all using the same
exact text that were basically say Obama
sucks and a few other things like that
it's how you can be damaged bla bla well
because they're all using the same
yes and there's there's been tons of
them submitted anyway again I didn't do
enough research on that to delve into it
too much and I did not want to dwell on
this topic too long because I've been
trained to bring it up on every episode
just to remind you guys I really
encourage you to go over there ongoing
diamonds yeah because yeah it's
important keeping the internet neutral
keeping the internet open for everyone
to access for new businesses that start
up with new websites to not be blocked
by an ISP who has a competing service
that they want to provide to you versus
that other competing service that they
want to they want to shut down yeah it's
a very very so what's what's the next
step now for the FCC like to to get C
commentary period is open for a couple
months now okay so it's going to be I
think a couple I'm sorry I don't know
the date but I believe it's two three
months that this next stage is open for
people to continue to submit more
comments right and then after that they
vote on it again and that's the final
vote and then they'll initiate whatever
rules they decide on based on that and
again most people are expecting they're
going to ignore most of the comments
yeah are they going to take a bunch of
these BOTS submitting comments and be
like oh well look at all these all these
comments yeah say the same thing that
we're clearly submitted by BOTS but we
don't care about that yeah and try to go
the other way with it no matter what and
again at that point it's just a matter
of like well how can you get those
people out of a FCC at that point it's a
matter of how can you get the people who
choose the people are going into the FCC
out yeah and will not go that far
because that's a bit too deep into
politics and we try to only touch on the
elements of politics that more directly
affect the stuff we talked about which
is technology although of course there's
plenty to talk about with politics but
let's not get too far off track let's
move back to let's move into a new
segment I'm have you heard where mmm
where's where's my yes where's my lower
third something we're all familiar with
and I just never it's not plagued with
evil missmiss uh you know deception and
lies can diffuse it miss and that kind
of thing indeed okay hi maybe hardware
we're going to start off talking about a
new Nvidia graphics card that launched
this week GT ten actually that week ago
the GT 1030 quietly launched didn't see
too much about this a few sites got some
samples from some third-party vendors
and stuff but the GT 1030 is a
cost alternative to integrated graphics
this is the Nvidia reference design for
it you can see it's a very small single
slot card it's only got two DVI outs
very low profile cooler so it's not
going to generate too much heats it's
got two gigs of gddr5 memory 64-bit bus
384 cuda cores so you're not talking
about a heavy hitter here by any means
however it does run a decent clock speed
1468 supports resolutions of up to 76 80
by 40 30 20 at 60 Hertz connectivity
varies but you'll probably have any
variants of the display port 1.4 hdmi
2.0 or dual link DVI probably two
outputs and a variant of those depending
on how much licensing your video card
manufacturer wanted to pay for since
HDMI costs more money it's going to be
in an expensive upgrade over integrated
graphics according to them UGA has a few
different SKUs that are out that the
article talks about and actually if you
go over onto Newegg you can actually
shop for these right now so I thought we
would just do that let's look at what's
available on doing 70 bucks yeah so
these are all in the like seventy to
seventy five dollar range and given that
they're going to be low profile like a
lot of these cards are low profile
options upgrade for pre-built and
low-power yeah a pre-built upgrade or a
solution for something that you just
need a video out for that you might need
some level of graphics performance so if
you're going to be playing back
excuse-me 4k video or something like
that potentially an option for you but
yeah super cheap and I'm sure there's
going to be people who take these and
pit them against integrated graphics and
that kind of thing but nice to know that
they're super small MSI apparently has a
more full sized one that's not low
profile and then MSI also has this one
here which is completely passively
cooled check that Wow yeah ultra-low
noise so yeah no noise
anytime you can have paths completely
passive cooling that that ups my
interest over something like something
like this of course it's going to be
more limited use cases when it comes to
strict gaming implementations that
and budget options they're out there for
you
sweet alright let's move on to this
article on a tech report FSP for
Travis's source power Fortran source for
something like that whatever they fist
yeah I tweeted about this a couple days
ago they have announced a new power
supply which has a water cooling option
why check it out the medium is the PTM
plus liquid cooled power supply who
needs a water-cooled power supply
honestly well I made a joke about
overclocking your power supply which I
thought was mainly a joke but you can
actually deliver more wattage no when
you connect it to an open-loop cooling
host like I believe these these looks
like a bits power I'm is that if it's
power logo looks like it it might be
something's a solution by bits power
down there why not just get a power
supply that is rated at the wattage you
need instead of overclocking it I don't
know you can't do that as easily with
CPUs as you can with like this seems
primarily to fit a niche of like yeah
that system build where it's like I went
crazy overkill with water cooling I'd be
like well you didn't know why to cool
the memory and SSD and the power supply
and you'd be like well my next build I'm
gonna do all that stuff and here's the
power supply like that's there's like
five people they're gonna have to build
a system where they water cool
everything then it should only make five
five of these unit and this is the power
supply they will only have five it
should be labeled one two three four
five yeah so FSP I mean for the record I
mean they're solid om of power supplies
they make lots of very nice units who
knows how much how much faith you need
to have in your water cooling abilities
to run a liquid cooled solution through
your primary 1200 watt unit uh as you
know this is very neat I guess it's very
hey just don't I just don't understand
yeah like has overheating power supplies
ever been an issue I know every our
supplies typically use very high end
never why very high end
components that it is bits power okay
confirm that this is the FSP actual
website for the hydro PTM plus and I
just don't like I just don't like the
fact that you're putting water even
closer to the power source yeah like why
don't we just have a water-cooled AC
outlet did I mention that sounds smart
did I mention it has RGB LEDs okay well
that makes everything okay
alright but if it wasn't for that it
wasn't really RGB LEDs I mean one little
tiny leak out of that little connector
there fell love with the inlet and
outlet any little league that gets into
any of those ports you're done you're
totally done I'm also curious like
there's some pictures here of like you
know some CAD designs of the block and
stuff like that and this appears to be
the block unit like I'm very curious
what in the power supply
it actually makes contact with and cools
right I'd like to see the actual water
because most power supplies you look at
like there's a like big-ass capacitors
and various other things like that in
there like yeah I don't know hopefully
maybe he's just anyway maybe a comfy Tex
they'll have like just depend opened up
version of this thing you can look at or
something like there's the bastard
doesn't do it just passive it's just
like whoops it straight Baker completely
completely aesthetic non-functional yeah
all right EK here's some real liquid
cooling from ek a new gaming series kit
so he can have several kits for a liquid
cooling that they sell that you can buy
the existing kits are what are they
called slim liquid and performance they
have slim liquid performance and extreme
series this is the gaming series because
you can't use any of those other kits
for gaming this is the only one you can
use for gaming that's not true
I try to make something to say something
there's obviously a box full of lies
Paul alright so they have a two forty to
eighty and 360 they're all named after
the radiator size and fans that are
included and the difference here is that
these are all coming with the dual five
and a quarter inch Bay pump reservoir
mounts how many cases actually have a
dual having according to pay these days
there's a decent number there are I
wanted to say that there are but that
one does be quiet - be quiet dark face
900 I just
there are but there are also they're
becoming increasingly unpopular it's
kind of the hip thing with many factors
just be like no one uses optical drives
anymore so yeah yeah but there's a lot
of cases that still do have them at
least a dual yeah sure and it is a very
viable place to mount a pump and
reservoir because you can have that on
the front and you can easily look and
see your liquid levels in that kind of
that's fun anyway so the gaming series
kit is available I believe now or might
be available soon again three different
sizes comes with ek bard our fans and
again that that BAE unit there up the
front Bay Bay Bay DUI believe that's DD
C Zion oh no wait hold on did it this
Asylum d5 pwm water pump oh that's
included day fancy okay
and of course UK fittings unluck they
include some clear clear concentrate to
add into the liquid so that when you're
filling your loop you can make sure to
put some some killer in there to make
sure you get no bacteria growing all
right cool so those should be available
now or soon awesome
next up cryo rig we talked a bit on Kyle
SAFF to show about some new career
products they're also coming out with
this cry rig h7 which has been a very
popular cooler the quad looming RGB
cooler version of this which includes
RGB LEDs
they've also reconfigured the pipe
configuration on it to allow for 20 a 20
watt higher GDP cooling as far as
classification and then apparently also
improved performance over standard h7
15% enough that means cooling or what
also edits forward for LGA 2011 v3 which
the original crier gauge 7 did not have
which is kind of nice
you had to upgrade to one of their
higher-end models that cost like 50
bucks for that so that's cool too and
then you have both an under global oh go
on top that lights up with RGB so here's
a question does it go with rise and
support out of the box do you still need
to get the after bracket I am not sure
about that I have to imagine that they
would include it in the box since this
is a yeah
we shipping protein out after am4 is
already out there right that would be
the only thing that makes sense but they
do have a name for bracket for the h7 so
I would imagine if this doesn't ship
with it in the box that yes you can
still get it by contacting Craig six
millimeter heat pipes and then of course
NZXT scam software can be used to
control the RGB LEDs which is really
nice because often when you get an RGB
LED thing if you're really into the RGB
LEDs that everyone's into it that's fine
if you're not but if you do get it often
the software that's supplied to control
it it's just lame or just has a very
limited number of options available to
it sure whereas NZXT scam is pretty
mature at this point since I've been
developing it for a while okay yeah
that's all for off and heavy hardware
let's move over to swordfight
we're Kyle and I argue about a
contentious topic for you guys and you
guys can all vote as well
contentious ism yes so arguments that's
what we're all about right now
so how to post this into chat on youtube
and over on Twitch so we can argue but
check this out
PayPal is mad at Pandora because of
their logo for their app so yeah so yes
right here you can see Pandora on the
Left yep PayPal on the right
woah they're both Peas yeah their most
piece how now the Pandora logo here is
new they have they started a bit of a
rebranding and redesign they redesign
some of their their their logos and
stuff like that um but PayPal was like
hey that's too similar yes confusing
memories and it is um huh people are
gonna click on your app instead of ours
does look pretty similar so uh yeah
basically they are having a trademark
law battle right now and we're going to
save them a bunch of money in lawyer
fees and decide this battle right here
and right now so who should win this
dispute what do you guys think is PayPal
on the right because they were there
first with their logo with the P on it
or is Pandora and the rates because it's
just a P man and you can't just make a
pee
and then be like that's my P and no one
else can use P anymore oh think I think
I think you know what Paul anyone can
use P no one owns P okay you know
everyone everyone has to pay to some
degree and that rhymes so it must be
true but when it comes to the type of P
or the characterization of the P
consistency of the P consistency of the
P flow of the P it should be a unique P
to you so if someone is copying someone
else that's a T it's my rap name by the
way
the thing is is like yeah P flow people
right so P flow you know if that was
your logo P flow if you had to pay pal
logo your P flow and then then like Papa
Papa Playa
came out with a track and a new logo
with that P which is the Pandora logo
you'd be like people are going to think
that hey is P flow you're gonna use me I
could get confused the thing is you can
have multiple P's they just need to be
different P's and while this is what
while pandora's P logo is slightly
different it's also similar in more ways
than one I mean any any person over the
age of 45 would probably get confused
like on their mobile phone it's very
ageist
for me to say but I could easily see
like my parents like looking at their
phone and seeing like the Pandora the
new Pandora app logo on their phone and
being like oh it's PayPal just click it
like we might catch on a little bit
sooner even I might get confused you
know and a drunken stupor like I often
do and be like ditz PayPal and like why
is paypal playing music now like what
the fuck's going so I mean I think
PayPal has at least a fighting chance to
win this argument and I think it's it's
fair of them to defend their current
logo because logos aren't cheap there's
a lot of thought process I remember when
I was choosing a logo for bit wit it
cost me some money to find a designer
who would you know kind of a create
create a logo that made sense and didn't
really look like anything else you know
it's tough there's a lot of logos out
there already in existence so it's it's
fine it's hard to find something
when you do you want to protect that
investment because you spent a lot of
time money and research developing that
logo people don't realize how much work
and energy goes into making a logo and
so when another big company like pandora
comes along and just kind of slaps on
some random blog that looks very similar
to yours that could cause some sort of
conflict or confusion among your viewers
and I'm sure there are a lot of people
who both use Pandora and PayPal right
those two are very like they're very
popular they're very useful
they're extremely popular so I could see
why PayPal might create a stink about
this and I think it's perfectly valid
because they're trying to protect their
investment and their brand so tell me
why I'm wrong Paul let me explain how me
why I'm wrong I everything I just said
um was heinous lies you're completely in
the pit of hell you're biased all right
sponsored by Plus no pinstripe and/or
now you probably have an expectation of
what I'm going to argue about here and
that's P right there's pee everywhere
there's too much pee they've taken the
pee they've reuse the pee and you can't
just do that with pee because you can't
just own pee like you can't like you can
be like that's my pee but it's really
everybody's pee I read it but I'm not
even going to talk about that I'm not
going to talk about how everyone should
have equal access to pee what I want to
talk about is nuance subtlety and nuance
and that is what clearly the designers
of the Pandora logo focused on as they
design this logo not only to clearly
represent their brand but also to
provide clear distinction between
Pandora and PayPal
let me demonstrate here as you can see
the logo side by side first off Pandora
obviously there is a pee in the center
of a rounded square as is typical of
most app icons now if you look at the
PayPal logo here the first thing you're
going to notice is that is literally the
opposite it is the opposite of Pandora
because the Pandora the center is blue
whereas there is white on the outside
PayPal opposite how can they be the same
they are opposite you might also notice
that PayPal has to piece a clear
distinction between the single P over on
Pandora and the addition of italicized
font italicized font universally
recognized as calling something out as
different special or unique which makes
it different special and unique when
compared to the Pandora logo I rest my
case
that's stupid you're dumb and no PayPal
hey those way superior company is never
started by Elon Musk I rebelled here you
got to go first
Tendo or sucks inches yeah most for the
win we've given people plenty of time
here so let's see what let's see what
you guys think it's horrible or you get
the results horrible what are your worst
oh look at that
40% for my new app PayPal PayPal didn't
read the third option
oh I never read the third option you
should with this useless pay Paul
actually which is a new app with a
similar logo so it just sends me money
we could all have it I need to I'm it's
this app is in development we're gonna
be launching the beta version soon you
should do that it's just you click on
you put much send you money cuz it's how
much money do you want to send Paul I
sent in five dollars yeah you know what
you know what Paul now you know what an
argument what the fuck's your logo hey
that's true gonna look exactly that's
that's why I argued in favor of it not
being infringement is so my logo could
also you'd be like I want to listen to
Pandora or send Paul money I'll do that
instead right now because that's what I
clicking on sorry we get confused
nothing to PayPal instead so thirty five
percent of voters say PayPal had
firsties and therefore they were
actually I'm kind of surprised at that
huh
I kind of would expect but you know it's
not too far off but but PayPal certainly
seems to win this is a little bit
different then the finebros trying to
copyright in trademark the word react
that's true that's a little different
it's because that was just a verbal
written word whereas this is an actual
image is such a design it's really a
design someone's created so there's a
difference there I can see why it's true
in that for you right guys that's a
strawpoll will stay open so if you're
watching the re-upload of this on
youtube you're still welcome to go down
there vote you could you could change
the future you could change the future
yeah all right that is all for my
prepared commentary and stuff your way
of the show which is awesome
we're gonna quickly answer some
questions that have been submitted with
cash donations in chat um which Kyle has
lined up I just burped it wait can i
define the beginning of the where's your
half end and my half begin oh wait uh
here we go
anything all set here we go uh dude
double John majid 200 rupees to ban gin
chattery again woo chattery right uh
Chowdhury chattery I know that's it
that's an awesome last name that's cool
chattery sounds like a dream on chowder
and curry the same powder and curry like
some New England clam chowder
Chowdhury or like like hurry it's
awesome I need some Japanese this
definitely he's still up - dude imagine
you know yeah my last for today hope you
still remember me from the previous half
we do hope someday you'll come to India
and meet both of you yeah you guys will
love our food places in people 236 a.m.
oh I love Indian food I happy I admire
your persistence staying up - slate and
I do love Indian food
anyway it's fantastic some good Indian
places around here there's a couple
around here that we'd love to go - yeah
let's get any food at this that we might
be able to do that maybe to see if the
packets to see what Joe yeah I still
need to pack that's important leave a
Cho you trap Davey chow ah stay on watch
because today is my last day of finals
after that summer I'll be able to live
live my dream and a flip
toilets and cleaning burgers $5 hookers
my treat for you both baby you are
mature beyond your age now there's like
years light-years ahead of your age um
well thank you very much good luck on
finals hope you hope you a sit and look
out for those hookers and you're gonna
look back and find this when you're
older on those summer jobs that used to
do when you were younger cuz it's it's
kind of nostalgic even though you don't
make tons of money I don't know I just
cuz it yeah really I look back I like
thank God I don't do it anymore yes now
those whore now that all the work is
done what I mean I mean I never said I
think for me it's cuz they were
typically like lower responsibility jobs
it's like what happens if I screw up and
don't come to work oh yeah nothing
nothing about like practically nothing
will happen we get another word that's
kind of cool all right Andre race our
mighty race - Lisbon Portugal March a
great job what do you know about my
country I know that your language is
Portuguese I know you have a great band
that comes from your your country called
Portugal the man oh cool there you go I
don't think they're from Portugal that I
think I'm not careful I know that I
always feel like Bates I always feel
like pulled Portugal's being crowded out
by Spain cuz like Portugal's right on
the edge there and Spain's like hey give
us some more group of Portugal's like
we're just yeah we're just some coast
right here yeah yeah right that maybe
that's true and you guys had some brutal
uh brutal um foreign import taxes - I
never citing an SSD to Portugal once it
was like oh five dollars or something
like that was crazy I know from watching
Anthony Bourdain that Portugal has a
delicious and unique cuisine which is
similar yet distinct from Spanish
cuisine beef testicle especially in some
of the places Portugal has colonized all
right I probably know more stuff about
Portugal is benevolent it'll take cool
James you can't catch to the
five-year-old's really will be better
thread Ripper or Intel I nine
uh that's deferred to say man we at we
don't know anything we don't know
anything at this point it's really it's
really hard to say I hope they're both
equally good if it continues a trend
going right now AMD will offer a
solution with a higher core and thread
count for less money
we'll offer more raw performance but in
cell will have a higher a better
instructions per clock when it comes to
per core and how it's doing
yeah which means that they would kind of
go back and forth on the benchmarks
depending on the software and stuff like
that right so yeah there's tons of
question marks out there but it's all
going to be high-end stuff so um it's
both exciting but also not quite as
practical for people who are buying like
you know budget six $700 systems yeah
you know it's not it's not going to
affect those people too much right but
still exciting for us all saying is you
probably don't have enough money to even
buy your one I'm trying to say this I'm
he's calling it's a more it's a more
niche yeah poor market aster than the
people who are building gaming PC's
because but but you know there's there's
a huge push in like into content
creation video editing and all kinds of
stuff like that so I'm sure there'll be
plenty of demand for both of them
yeah and hopefully there will be
different reasons to say use this versus
you this depending on your subject a
cheaper one will be better
yeah Quinton Moseley $20 80 bucks
keep on living the dreams hashtag beer

Aaron now look at lettuce has said he
will do a d-wave vid any chance one of
you can get a hrl of quail tour please
please please not Lou cliff I prefer get
got tired of shower asking wait was what
is HL everyone what do you weigh in each
RL I don't know what is it you talking
about D wait what is do you I mean this
is something I should be aware of but
I'm not d-wave do you wave do you wave
systems do quantum computing Oh quantum
computing okay all right I do not have
any connection with D wave everybody and
practical application for quantum
computer would be way out of my my like
either of our ranges for what we
typically talk typically talk about yeah
that said I'd be very excited to check
it out
sure and uh you know investigate into it
more and see what it's capable of and
that kind of thing but the fact
I don't know when hrl quailed 4 is
probably indicates that I'm probably not
close to taking one that that I'm a post
one you haven't been following the
quantum computing landscape quite quite
as closely as you could be more or less
but yeah fascinating but not something I
am currently directly have access to I

yeah knuckle Ripper yeah like it depends
on the case you choose I suppose indeed
go down $5 hey Paul D up my other
Spyderco knives of them the tenacious
that you use on camera very easily one
of my favorite brands so my tenacious go
it's over there I don't it's my only one
better Co I still use a crappy just
cheapy razor blade that I got or my
scissors it's very very mediocre it's
incredibly mediocre Alex B $2 upgrade
from a 4770k and gtx 980 to a 1600 and
1074 1440p i would say you're good on
the cpu man don't change the 4770k
if you wanted to you could upgrade your
gtx 970 to us a 1070 if you were going
from 1080p to 1440p because you will be
getting quite a bit more frames with the
1070 you can sell your GTX 970 for a
decent amount maybe 150 bucks or
something like that and put that towards
a 1070 which are fairly reasonably
priced these days you can get one with a
pretty decent aftermarket cooler on it
for around you know 3 or 350 bucks and
see a whopping performance I would not
upgrade to the 1600 rise in from the
4770k unless you're thinking about doing
some more heavily threaded tasks like
video editing if you're doing some
rendering or if you're doing live
streaming heavily then it could be a
decent upgrade but other than that like
the four cores 80 threads will be
working just fine on that core pending
on your situation in some configurations
and at some resolutions you'll get less
performance out of that 1070 with the
1600 then you would out of the 4770k you
especially if you're overclocking near
4770k absolutely I'd say stick with a 40
like calcium stick with the 4770k and
grabbed at 1070 yep okay good
good option dayton hens nelson $10 love
both your channels have built multiple
builds with your help that's really
awesome to hear as always I would like
to use Rison with Linux and VM windows
for gaining have you guys had any
interest in doing something like this I
honestly never worked with virtual
machines that's something that um is
still sort of foreign to me I get the
gist of it but um I have not yet had a
need to do it which is probably why I
haven't delved into it at this point but
um I'd be curious to learn more about it
though yeah Peyton if you're not already
familiar with them context level one
text is where you would definitely want
to go because that is where I've seen
the most investigation into Rison
performance with Linux iommu
configurations that function with Linux
to pass through I believe that's passed
through the GPU so you can get proper
GPU support with Linux so I have I'm
wrong about that but yeah go go
subscribe to level on level one text
message Wendel on Twitter and he's super
enthused about that kind of stuff and I
will say I am curious about that but
like Kyle and sorry I have not delved
into it that much myself me planet
vampire comm sorry I'm burping $5
donation I'm upgrading my 2600 K build
which has a dying motherboard should I
get a 77 or K rig now or wait hoping for
coffee like higher core count for 4k
gaming only definitely wait for right
now because in the next week we're gonna
have it seems like new Intel stuff
coming out and even though that's
high-end desktop stuff that they're
talking about maybe something there's
really it's really the stuff they've
been talking about coming out with onyx
$2.99 is is varied in many ways like KB
like X for example it's all rumors we
don't have that confirmed details for
now but it should you should have a much
better idea once Computex comes out of
what's there yeah so I would say
there might be more options that you
might consider versus a 7700 k so it's
definitely worth waiting for that at
least
yeah beyond that I don't think there's
too many platforms coming out so after
Computex you should hopefully have a
good idea of the current landscape and
what you can choose yeah charrid mtech
for $10 hey guys would it be worth it to
trade in my nitro fury in for an RX 580
for the vram upgrade or would that be a
lateral move performance wise keep up
the great content well both the channels
um a nitro fury I'm thinking what that's
probably like oh okay the fury for arch
high maybe um it would be an upgrade for
sure especially on the VM side I'm not
sure I don't know because it's what HBM
versus the way you're talking about
energy carries supposed to still perform
better I don't even know I have not
directly compared both of these cards
myself hmm I don't know I feel like the
RX 580 might overtake it I could be
wrong yeah you're right I haven't tested
it myself near em um you got what four
gigs of HBM versus eight gigs of gddr5
um I don't know I'd prefer the capacity
at this point over HB m it's it's like
without having tested both of them
directly against each other myself and
there's probably people who have done
that and I would recommend do their
videos some Google searches to people
who have directly compared a fury to an
RX 580 I feel like it would be more of a
lateral move yeah that's my feeling
again and I would highly recommend
looking at people who have directly
compared the two of those to get a
better idea I feel like for people
within that within that performance
level of like sort of the Nitro Fury or
nine Nano the only card I would really
ask them upgrade would be a gtx 1070 or
higher quite a few people and chatter
saying the Fury is definitely faster
than a 580 okay so which is the
impression I had - yeah fury should be
faster than his 580 thanks to all they
get you guys in chat and pointed that
out and pointed it out tactfully - no
one was like noobs you dicks
obviously some no even though that would
have been totally warranted I was born
no yeah yes a lateral move if not a
downgrade so stick with your fury okay I
think cheered him Nathan thatch thanks
again for your donation on both halves
of the show thanks for the last video
you uploaded gave me the best idea to
mount my daughter's neck to a d15
vertically so it can fit my s340 you de
bomb Nathan if you're the same person
who tweeted to me this thing
I say again to you I am glad that that
was able to help you out I know that's
really a niche situation and I'm also
still absolutely amazed that a d15 fits
in an S 340 which is a relatively
smaller case that's that I'm not too
surprised that case right thing it's
very small but I feel like it's got
enough clearance vertically or I guess
horizontal yeah it's the horizontal
clearance but um yeah Alex Bevin two
dollar donation thank you so much
love your bits can you make an old 775
PC Alex if I had a motherboard yeah I
mean I do I have a couple LGA 775
motherboards I do not I would need at
first part of me says like no I wouldn't
do that but then the second part of me
says I've seen the random gaming and HD
videos because his videos keep popping
up on my feets and all he does all he
does is post about like hey I found this
old piece of crap for two bucks and I'm
like like maybe I should find old pieces
of crap for two bucks make videos out of
them
that could be interesting they do pretty
well I mean there's subscribers also
very consistent so yeah I mean his
videos are good he does a good job
covering stuff yeah concise and all that
stuff so my Q stuff too you know but
seeing stuff like that makes me consider
other possibilities for what I might
cover so I don't want to rule out
something like 775 I don't have any
media plans to do that though I just got
an HP Pavillion a zero zero a zero zero
zero from my aunt and uncle Oh God who
have had it in their family for 12 years
so and they just they just got they
dropped it off at my house 2005 um yeah
something like that
so I'm I might be doing a video on that
soon okay it's it's pretty hairy
convenor estai popped the side panel off
after I got back from Hawaii I was like
good god it's like never been cleaned
before no never never
this is the best kind
the biggest Delta in terms of
performance increase anyway Luke Timmons
can five dollars $85 Californian five
California dollars should I upgrade go
ahead chef grade my power supply for my
next PC bill or be used my own t sonic
and get cable mods surprisingly close in
price Luke I'd say if you have AC sonic
power supply keep using your C sonic
power supply and some extensions because
that's why you buy a nice power supply
like a see sonic that's well-built and
don't go with a cut-rate one as you can
see you can use the same power supply
for eight like Kyle's mentioning if like
a 12 year old system if you bought a
high-end nice power supply 12 years ago
it's so gonna be good
it would probably still work just fine
branded it might not have the efficiency
ratings and all that kind of stuff but
for your purposes I'd say stick with
that see sonic you weight sells adding
stuff so what are you doing bringing
attention $5 I'm upgrade from 4790k to
and r9 390x to a GTX 280 I and Verizon
7200 with an nvme that I only have
Windows on should I transfer games to
nvme i/o I would say yes for within
whatever capacity is able to be handled
by your nvme Drive and so if you got a
240 gig nvme drive put on like one or
two games that are the games that you
play the most and ideally not GTA 5 s it
takes up 80 or 90 gigs or something like
that yeah like that's really what you're
looking at what games do you play the
most that you just want to load quickly
it's not going to affect the performance
of the game as far as frames per second
it's just going to be like when you
click that game and get me into the game
it's going to be faster yeah so I'd say
yes definitely make us if you got a
steam or whatever make make a games
folder on there but also have one on
your on your hard drive or whatever so
you can take stuff still install it
without getting the filling up your nvme
SSD too much if you get past about 80%
full on your nvme SSD I'd start cutting
stuff back you don't want to get too
much past that because I'll slow down
its performance true finally we have a
Miss question from my half from Mike for
five dollars I have 6 3 pin fans that I
had hooked into a SATA powered
they screamed at 1500 rpm bought three
splitters I only have two CH a ports can
I use CPU opt yes you can use CP opt for
any other you know four pin fan that you
have one wanting to connect that
shouldn't be a problem um I mean it's
not the only question here yeah so Mike
yes you can use that CPU CPU opt is
usually the secondary CPU fan so it's
going to rent the same rpm that the CPU
fan runs that opt optional it's optional
you know um so yes you can plug in there
I would also consider something like
getting you can usually run three or
four fans off of a single fan hub but I
mean as long as they're not super high
rpm fans or something like that
so a silverstone if you look up fan
splitter silverstone on Amazon they have
one for like six bucks and it's one plug
and it leads to three plugs on the other
end and they're all daisy chains which
is nice because you can plug in one here
and then take the daisy chain and extend
it out somewhere else to plug in
something else I would opt for that well
I don't know if you just want to get it
done yeah just plug into the CPU
optional fan if not consider something
like a daisy chain that lets you plug in
three fans for per plug or something
like that yeah alright that is all for
my half of the show that's all about
some hardware oh no it's not
dammit I don't keep any up - okay
personally Lawrence thank you very much
sir Johnson - you picking up a navy-blue
CPU cooler shirts I've only got one I
thought I had oh wait now I've got
Martin and then we've got a bio sponsor
shirt from Lawrence gets his double
drats in Murray double Johnson thank you
very much Emory Lawrence double Johnson
you got a pub glass wait does Emory get
a double Jones Emory also gets a double
ooh he got the heavy middle gray t-shirt
logo it's a good one and finally a
Johnson - John thank you so much John
from Virginia got the thumbscrew decal
yeah you oh yeah alright guys thank you
so much for tuning in to episode 106
we're gonna kick it off to a raid at
which rate those of you who are on
twitch right now we are going to go
ahead and host Puget systems oh yeah
hugest systems they do some really great
work their articles are fantastic
streaming we're gonna host them go ahead

friend of Jarrell friend of Jerry's well
go ahead and tell them that Paul and I
Sencha and give them give them lots of
love give them lots of love and praise
Laureus they do some good work over
