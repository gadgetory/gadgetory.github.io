this week I've been working on lots of
different stuff so for instance I have
the Nash build that I've put together
over here I finally got that sort of
setup and the basics up and running so I
have a video for that coming on Saturday
I've also been working on getting the
parts together for my wife's
water-cooled system that I'm going to
build in the fractal define nano s and
I've also been going doing the sort of
ongoing organization and and putting
things where they should be project here
in my work area and I've come across a
lot of CPUs that I've had so I thought
this might be something interesting for
you guys to take a look at - which is a
lot of the CPUs that I've kind of
collected over the years in working in
technology and that kind of thing so I'm
going to go over what I have here in
front of me this isn't every CPU that I
own because a lot of them are in use in
systems that I have up and running here
and there and this is by no means an
exhaustive look at like you know the
history of CPUs or anything like that
this is just what I still have on me I
try to collect these when I can but I
don't really do it like I don't have
like a CPU from every socket and
platform that's ever existed or anything
like that that'd be nice to have maybe
maybe in the future someday actually
let's start out with probably a problem
that a lot of you guys have encountered
which is it I don't have all the CPUs
I've ever used because I've resold them
a lot of you did what I probably did
back in the day which is I built a
system use it for a couple years and
then I would sell the system you know
maybe scavenge a couple parts but sell
the system in order to buy parts to
build a new system so I do have a couple
CPUs that I wish I still had around
including the first actual desktop
computer that's my dad bought back when
I was just an early teenager and that
was using an Intel 46 DX chip which is
an old-school processor and I don't even
know what happened in that system when
he finally got rid of it but that was a
family system from there I moved to an
AMD k-6 to 450 that CPU ran at 450
megahertz
it was absolutely fantastic for me and
then again I sold that system when I was
through with it and I moved on to the
Pentium 4 now my and BK 6 to 450 system
was pretty epic but it was based on a
bare-bones system that I had bought at
Fry's so I didn't really put the whole
thing together a piece it
myself my third system that I could say
was the first system I really got all
the parts for individually and put
together I also don't have because I did
resell it but I do have some pictures so
that one at least I can share with you
guys and give you a better a better idea
of like an old-school system that I
built back in a day so um here it is
look I've got an NR max power supply
that's a that's always a good decision
you might notice here that I have for
instance like a copper CPU cooler on
there that's that's kind of cool I also
might notice that the cable management
management is pretty terrible
you know it's using an 8-bit motherboard
EBIT was my standby go-to motherboard
company for quite some time this is a
th7 raid motherboard from them these
pictures actually took before I sold the
system so you know this epic features
like dual optical drives DVD as well as
a I think it's like a 24 speed CD burner
as well as a floppy disk you'll notice
my genuine Windows XP key right there
which you guys are all welcome to steal
now and then there's the system itself I
have no idea of what kind of case set is
all I know is that front panel like when
you when you tapped on it it would slide
down kind of like it was on hydraulics
or something like that and I thought
that was pretty badass
so here all my CPUs arrayed sort of in
chronological order so AMD is on the
bottom row Intel is on the top row these
are actually from about 2002 to 2003 on
the far left here going all the way up
to about present day for both for both
manufacturers now overhead in the far
left you'll notice these CPUs don't have
heat spreaders on them that was a big a
big advancement that was made and you
see Intel and AMD both doing that with
heat spreaders and all their CPUs I'll
show you why they do that the CPU right
here but AMD for their part went from
these Athlon XP chips to their Athlon 64
chips this was when they were doing
really well really putting the screws to
Intel this is when they started
introducing some fancy new features like
IMC integrated memory controller as well
as actual dual-core processors as
opposed to single core single thread
processors that have been available
prior to them from there
they kept moving forward with the Phenom
series followed up to Phenom to series
and then currently we have the top and
AMD CPUs the AMD FX series that's an 80
350 right here which is actually
launched in 2012 but it's still the
fastest AMD
CPU you can get if you're saying Paul
you're wrong they have that 9000 series
as well well you know the 9000 series is
just an 80 350 that's been so it can
overclock more so if you buy an 80 350
and you can overclock the 5 gigahertz
it's a 95 90 gray as for Intel we start
up here on the top left with a Pentium 4
old-school super heat generating Pentium
4 after that Intel started to get their
act together after AMD came out with
their FX or the Athlon 64 FX series so
Intel started really pushed this is when
they introduced their tick-tock cycle
after that so these are LGA 775 CPUs the
QX 6600 and the Intel Pentium Extreme
Edition 955 or what I have here and this
is where Intel decided you know those
pins on the bottom of CPUs it can get
bent and broken and damaged and stuff
we're going to move those onto the
motherboard so that's as the first LGA
land grid array CPUs from Intel and
these I mean a QX 6600 is still very
very highly respected chip being a quad
core and everything the extreme edition
was very high had a very high clock
speed one of my CPUs that I do wish I
still had was my eye 7 9 20 I did have
one ended up selling it this was the
first time Intel gave the enthusiast
platform its own socket and chipset so
this was LGA 1366 socket compatible CPU
and they'd used x58 chipset motherboards
they also introduced triple channel
memory at this time which is pretty
sweet
I am skipping a few generations in
between this lineup of Intel CPUs over
here because I don't have them all but
this is a 2500 K that is a Sandy Bridge
CPU this is actually the second
generation Intel Core CPUs the 2500 K
has a soft spot in all of our hearts
because had amazing performance
fantastic overclock ability and it was
reasonably priced it was like 215 bucks
or so I think when it launched beyond
that of course you have these bigger
CPUs on the top right and that's Intel's
enthusiast lines so starting with the
Extreme Edition I think Intel kind of
got the idea
hey we should make a separate series for
the people who are really into this kind
of stuff so they made the enthusiast
platform but I do have here is this AI
739 60 X this launched in 2011 and it
would suck at 2011
and x79 chipset motherboards Intel also
stepped up to quad-channel memory
support with this series and this was
also the first time that Intel came out
with a consumer six core processor next
we have the newest Intel enthusiast
series which is going to be using x99
chipset LGA 2011 - three motherboard
sockets or socket motherboards and this
is a 5820k out of a 59 30 K and a 59 60
X which are all super awesome this one I
use for testing and stuff like that but
then lastly we have a 6700 K which is
the current fastest consumer-level
processor the Intel makes although it is
still a quad core where as you can get
six or an eight core CPUs if you go with
their enthusiast platform let's move
back over here to the beginning though
and take a closer look at some of these
chips because I think they deserve a
closer looking at so let's start with
this one this is the Athlon XP again the
specific one we're looking at here is
the 3200 AMD also at this time used some
pretty confusing nomenclature to name
their CPUs so this has a 3200 plus is
the actual name of the CPU Athlon XP
3200 plus although the 3200 plus was
sort of AMD being tricky they're trying
to say that you know what the frequency
doesn't matter because of some other
things they built in there and up till
then
well even still now frequency is often
looked at as like what makes a CPU fast
this 3200 plus though actually had a
2200 megahertz clock speed in in real
life but AMD was basically saying that
this lines up with processors from Intel
that run at 3200 or 3.2 gigahertz this
one is a foreigner megahertz bus fee
that launched in May of 2003 and it sold
for just about $500 yeah that's right
$500 for an AMD processor anyway though
it doesn't have a heat spreader which is
probably the main thing that you'll
notice here we're at vs. like these
processors that have that metal piece on
top but this actually lets you look
directly at the CPU die which is just
that's that square that rectangle that's
right there in the center and this is
what was exposed on CPUs for for lots of
time it you might notice it also has
these four little pads on each corner
and that's so that when you were putting
like a heat sink fan on top
of it to keep the thing cool it wouldn't
damage the dye nevertheless that was
still fairly easy to do one other thing
before I show you the other one is just
to look at the pins on the bottom also
very very I want to say the pins are
large they might look small but these
are so these are pretty thick pins on
there especially if you compare it to
say newer ones on the Athlon 64 so
you'll notice you know they made the
pins a lil bit finer that actually meant
that these older CPUs as far as the pins
on the bottom this is PGA by the way
which is pin grid grid array we're
actually a little bit harder to damage
from the pin side as far as bending pins
and that kind of thing
I'll show you some vent pins here in
just a second as well but why was this
guy so delicate and why is there a
legacy now of whenever you install heat
sink fan that you should install and
mount one corner and like the you know
the cross pattern you're supposed to do
when you're when you're tightening down
heat sink fan you're supposed to like
just get one corner kind of on there and
then do a cross pattern one corner and
only only a tighten it down a little bit
at a time that is because before people
realized that this was a problem they
would do stuff like this this is another
Athlon XP processor it's not too much
different than the one I just showed you
this is a slightly lower model 2800 Plus
though Athlon XP this one did launch a
year earlier in 2002 and it sold for
about four hundred dollars when it
launched but to look at that I left the
heat I left the thermal paste on here
let me get you guys a nice close look
though so if you guys can see that
corner right there just where I'm kind
of trying to point at with this razor
it's chipped just the corner has a
little nick on it right there
that means this processor is dead that's
right the actual die that you're looking
at right there on top has about the
resiliency of glass which meant that if
you did try to put a heat spreader down
on this and you did just go ahead and
tighten down one corner of it all the
way down before you bothered with any of
the other corners it was going to go
down and put pressure at an angle and
you were going to end up breaking the
corner of your CPU die and then your CPU
is dead then you'd return it so wherever
you bought it from and if I was the
person at the place where you bought it
from who took the CPU out and looked at
it
I would then send you an email that says
I'm sorry sir or ban your CPU is
physically damaged and cannot be
replaced and it was very sad the
flipside to that though would be
flipside that's kind of a joke let me
show you though anyway this this Pentium
4 right here which is in shadow but look
look it's a Pentium 4 had lots of use
this isn't my Pentium 4 unfortunately
this is this is a different Pentium 4 I
didn't use this one personally alright
so as you can maybe see on the corner
here we have a massive amount of bent
pins on this which meant whoever had
this processor before mishandled it or
perhaps they tried to install it with
pressure when they were using a ZIF or
zero insertion force socket but anyway
they managed to bend these pins down
pretty horribly I might add there's
there's several more scattered
throughout this particular CPU bent pins
I did notice though that none of these
are actually broken off when I would get
returns of this nature and I saw bent
pins I would actually often spend a bit
of time and I got pretty good at
repairing them I'm not going to show you
guys exactly how I did it now but
basically take a razor blade I can't
even see what I'm doing but you know
whatever
you take a razor blade any I would kind
of put it along one line and kind of you
know bend one line to be straight and
then I go with the razor blade into the
other direction and do along the line
there and kind of bend them up to be
straight and it took a lot of kind of
precision and patience and and
carefulness and that kind of thing but
as long as the pins weren't like bent
flat down to the PCB you can generally
get them to sit up straight again and
once you've gotten those all
straightened up in the lines and drop it
back into a socket generally the CPU
would still work so whereas with chipped
dies on on CPUs without a heat spreader
I was pretty much forced to give people
bad news often when damaged CPUs of this
nature would come through I was able to
fix them and if I got it working again
then we were able to honor the RMA and
give the person a well usually they
wanted to refund with something like
this but yeah I always felt like that
was nice to be able to dude be ok
you broke your but I fixed it so
here's your refund moving up the line on
our AMD processors though you'll notice
this one here that has some some actual
writing on it so I wrote down at LAN 64
3000 plus on this because that's
that's what it is however if you see the
actual text printed on the heat spreader
there ad a 4600 da a 5 B V that is a
that's not the same that's not the same
model as an Athlon 64 3000 plus the
difference in price between a 3000 plus
and the the 4600 at the time when this
processor first hit my hot hands was
pretty significant I think the 3000 plus
you can get for 200 to 250 dollars
whereas the 460 was over 800 or M for
the 4600 so this was a unique chip that
came through and basically what the
entrepreneur in person who had this chip
originally did was they popped off the
heat spreader saudi-led deleting a cpu
is what that's often called but they
were able to use whatever methods were
at their disposal to pop off the heat
spreader from a much more expensive cpu
of 4600 then they took a cheaper CPU
this 3000 plus and remounted the heat
spreader to it and then returned it and
try to get a refund we caught them I'm
happy to say we tested it and we're like
that's not the right CPU dude very very
sneaky though and I don't know I don't
know if this is something that still
happens or not I'm kind of out of that
that that realm anymore but um for what
it's worth this is still a working 3000
plus AMD processor it's just it just has
the wrong heat spreader on it
look all the pins are nice - I also
wanted at least give you guys a quick
look at this one because it's just it's
one of these God like it's a god like
I'll call it that God like this is an
Athlon 64 FX this is the FX 62 F X 60
and of FX 62 where I think we're kind of
at the peak of AMD's like dominance when
in the mid 2000s and the CPU industry
these were more than $1000 they were
dual-core at a time when dual-core was a
very very new thing and they were also
overclockable
which is pretty badass let's move up to
the a to the Intel slide though so I can
show you guys this QX 6600 Core 2 quad
LGA 775
you might notice I wrote I have these
labeled I wrote engineering sample on
this because
is an engineering sample before I go
into what an engineering sample is let's
look at the bottom you'll notice this is
an LG a CPU so since I showed you this
horrible Pentium 4 with all of the bent
pins until eventually got sick of that
and I like you know we could do we can
move all those pins over to the
motherboard side and then no one will
ever be able to to bend pins on a CPU
ever again and they haven't been able to
do that so LJ is land grid array and
that's again as opposed to your AMD
processors your AMD processors which are
PGA or pin grid array ok back to the
engineering sample thing you might
notice here if you can read that text
which I think you're able to at the top
there it says Intel confidential in
telecom potential so an engineering
sample is basically CPU the Intel has
produced that is not meant for retail
sale so instead of stamping it with what
you would see on a retail CPU which do I
even have any do I have any of those are
all of my yeah it would appear it would
appear that pretty much that's not
entirely true I do it I do have none
I do have not engineering sample Intel
processors but none of the ones that are
out here those are all engineer examples
anyway I'm not engineering sample like
this one will actually say what
processor is on the on there and will
tell you like you know the SKU and that
kind of thing whereas engineering sample
processors well not they have a very
mysterious a bit of text on there which
says Intel confidential it will I think
tell you yeah it'll tell you where the
fab is so this one's from Malay and it
might give you a little bit of extra
information but often with engineering
samples it becomes difficult especially
if you have multiple ones of them to
tell which one is which that's why
you'll notice on my engineering sample
CPUs over here I usually put a some some
nonstick tape up there so with writing
as for what they are or you can just use
you know a permanent marker and write
directly on them or you can do what I
did with my 39 60 X and do a little bit
of text that's actually right up there
on the PCB on edge and that also works
as well so there you have it guys
hopefully this has been a
a nostalgic walk down memory lane for a
few of you and perhaps an eye-opening
look at the way CPUs have developed
physically at least over the past 10 or
15 years for others probably most
specifically those who are newer to the
PC enthusiasts DIY build your own
computer space group that's that's
that's official but PC master-race we'll
just call it that anyway thanks so much
