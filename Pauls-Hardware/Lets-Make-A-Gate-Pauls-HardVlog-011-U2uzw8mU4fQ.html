the case may be it's morning here
welcome to this video this is not a
normal video because I'm vlogging and
I'm outside I'm kind of outside of it in
my car
I'm going to be building a fence today
and a gate so if you're not into that
then maybe come back at a later date
when I doing my normal videos which are
mostly about computers and Technology
this one I'm just building a gate I
can't even really call this a garage
work log because I'm not even gonna be
working in my garage I'm on the side of
my garage anyway I'm going to home
people right now I need to pick up just
a couple more things to finish this
project then I'll show you guys me
building a gate I hope it's fascinating
anyway I'm taking you along for the ride
though whether you like it or not some
Depot is a mysterious and magical place
I'm gonna tools out right now because I
got a few tools but I've already been
distracted just buying other things so I
got this stud sensor I needed a better
stud finder get some rope and doing a I
have an idea for a pulley system for
some of my lights in the garage so I got
a bunch of stuff for that stuff as well
but the part I'm actually here for is a
where to go disappear that's over here
need a hammer drill me at this one I
already researched it 50 books and here
goes the Obi okay I've returned home I'm
in my backyard and here's here's what I
got going on here so this is kind of the
area behind my garage normally like our
trash cans are right here and part of
the reason I'm doing this project is so
I can move the trash cans over to the
side of the house and then this area
here I want to use to like build stuff
because I need to build some shelves and
whatnot inside the garage so anyway
here's a what I've got going on this is
my workbench made up of computer boxes
this is some redwood that I picked up
actually got that on Saturday and
brought it over here so what I just
picked up that I needed was this drill
right here which was a hammer drill um
ended up being used accidentally found
out as I was at the cash register and
she was like hey this box looks like
it's been opened so she opened it up and
she knocked 15 bucks off the price so I
was like alright that's cool long as it
works so I got it for 35 bucks instead
of 50 bucks
I've got these lag bolts these are four
inch by half inch galvanized lag bolts
with washers so those are going to be
used to hold one of the posts to the
side of the cinderblock wall over there
I don't know what else to tell you guys
this is all just stuff I had out
yesterday that is using because I have I
was working on this yesterday
and today I'm hopefully gonna finish my
REO be hammer drill here is going to be
supplementing my existing drill which is
a black and decker which I've been told
is the raid max of the power tools but
this one I've actually had for four or
five years and does is been doing a
great job for me only just yesterday did
I realize using this in place of a
hammer drill not very effective if you
didn't want to go into something like a
cinder block wall other than that I've
got my my other power tools here
circular saw on my jig saw cuz they'll
probably be needing those other Hardware
other tools safety glasses cut it keeps
that ready so here's the side of the
house and here's what I did yesterday so
the guessing fence the fence that's
there is a temporary fence that's just
kind of propped up and I've been meaning
to replace that for quite some time so
finally getting around to it I have a
4x4 a redwood 4x4 right here and this I
set up yesterday actually used some dug
a big old post hole couple feet down put
some gravel down in the bottom by the
way if anyone's watching this trying to
get advice on how to do this take
anything I say with a massive grain of
salt and by no means an expert at any of
this stuff here I'm just kind of going
with some of this stuff I already know
and some stuff that I've looked up
online anyway I put gravel at the base
of this one there's gonna be another 4x4
against the wall here and that's what I
started drilling holes for yesterday
then my batteries ran out on my Black &amp;amp;
Decker drill Dan here I got some gravel
should put gravel gravel at the base of
the post that way you get some drainage
there so you don't get to like rot or
mildew and then down then there's the
post hole that I dug yesterday filled up
with some quikrete just poured some
water in there and that has set up and
this this thing's pretty rock solid now
very sturdy so what I'm gonna do next
and I'm probably not going to do much
narration I'm just gonna kind of point
the camera at what I'm doing and do it
as I need to mount this other 4x4 to the
wall right here I need to drill like one
and a half more holes
for that to mount with those big old
screws not that 4x4 over there build a
small fence here and then build a gate
that I'm going to be mounting right
there and hopefully everything goes
smoothly
it took me a bit of time yesterday and
what I probably could annum better job
on at least I didn't have the right bits
to go wide enough but these are my
counter sink holes for my big lag bolts
and I had to make this hole wide enough
that the washer could fit down in there
so I had to widen it at some point
yesterday anyway but that's a four by
fours pretty much all setup I got three
mounting points one here there's a lag
bolt already in there and one more down
at the bottom that should be enough and
then the only other thing I'm going to
do on the opposite side over here in the
actual wall of the garage is mount a 2x4
just before the strike plate for it to
close on and that one still not sure
actually how I'm gonna mount that anyway
hopefully I'll come back towards the end
of the day her later this afternoon and
show you guys my progress here goes
let's get to work
okay quick update because I don't forget
film anything in a while I got the site
pretty much finished good to go it's all
nice and solid in there you got the 4x4
mounted to the wall over on the side up
bridge piece in lower piece in and I got
all of these pickets installed so it
wasn't too bad at all this last one here
along the edge I had to trim the side
off of to get to fit in there next up
I'm working on getting the the strike I
think it's called the strike border to
the place for the strike plate on the
other side ready together here is the
holes I've been punching in the wall to
my garage because I don't have like a
solid piece to to mount to in there so
I'm actually using these little gates
which are called toggle bolts this is
one of the things I found recommended in
one of the I forget it was I think was a
forum or something like that that I
found so basically these fold up like
that pop through the hole pop out on the
other side and that grips against the
wall and I just got to tighten it down
from the outside through the points that
I've drilled in this board here and of
course actually once I get that in there
I'm gonna I have a little bit of space
on the side I need to goop it up and put
some what do you call it that stuff on
there that goopy stuff keeps critters
out anyway off we go
alright guys it's it's Tuesday now and I
wanted to give a little bit of closure
to this video so uh also this is this is
what I look like I have my hat on
because it's sunny and my protective
safety glasses hey here's the pink
though as you can see I'm finished
actually got to be about ninety seven
point five percent of the way finished
yesterday but I had to call it cuz it
got dark I had mounted the gate but I
mounted it a little bit too low and
since the cement kind of slopes up a
little bit here it wasn't opening so
today I had to take it and basically
shift it up like one notch here from the
holes there oh and actually I need to
fill I've been filling these in with
some wood filler I need to fill one more
in that day than that once that was up
there had to sand down a little bit on
the side just to get to open and close
properly also got the mechanics
installed over here for the latch and
little little catch plate there or
whatever it's called but everything's
all together and it even works so open
and I can handle built in and everything
it opens just like that and there it is
pretty sturdy you know I can just pull
it closed apparently I need to clean my
lens I'll do that later anyway that's my
gate it's all done and now I've just
realized since I didn't put the string
in yet I can't go back through
I'm trapped outside anyway that's all
for this video guys thank you so much
for watching I'll be back soon with not
more fence building videos it's probably
only fencing gate building video that
you ever see for me but who knows maybe
I'll do more in the future if this is
insanely popular or something like that
thanks for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
