link in the video description to learn
more what's up guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware this is my monthly builds
video for June 2019 this is a monthly
series where I do parts lists for
computers so if you don't know what
parts to pick to build your computer
with then maybe this video will help you
out or if not this video maybe some of
my older videos because I do these just
about every month although I did not do
this last month for various reasons but
check out my personal update video if
you want more info on that this month I
have a couple builds one of them is
based on what you guys voted on last
month's which was actually for May I
guess you voted on it in April point
being you wanted to see the ultimate
htpc 2019 Edition I assumed that you
were talking about my htpc so I did sort
of an updated parts list for that that
we're gonna go over and then beyond that
so much has happened since I originally
asked you guys about this most
specifically AMD announcing and
confirming there is n2 series of
processors which are coming out so here
is a strawpoll for next month that you
guys should go and vote on its link down
in the video description and we've got
the rise in 3900 X that should be
available they're going to be up for
pre-sale on July 1st and they're
actually supposed to ship out I believe
on July 7th yes 7 7 for the 7 nanometre
processors just have a bang for the buck
1 with the rise in 3600 which is a $200
6 core processor 3900 X is going to be a
$500 12 core processor also maybe we'll
have some more info on Navi by then and
then you know for you until fans we got
that fourth option but this video is
actually one of the more challenging
ones to make right now because we're in
an inflection point we know there are
new CPUs launching next month
but I'm supposed to be telling you guys
what to build right now if you have to
build a computer right now if you can't
wait a month I have a build for you
which is basically these end to ready PC
if you want to upgrade to Zen to you
good plan to upgrade to Zen - or if
you're buying a CPU right now you should
be planning to buy Zen - but if you need
to buy right now you can get something
that will tide you over and then you can
upgrade us into next month or in a
couple months so that is the build we're
going to start with but speaking of Zen
- here is what is actually going to be
available this is an article from an
antic that has them all in a fancy
little chart there's there's a cpus
themselves if you want a little bit more
info on zen - there is an ananza Kartika
linked in the description that has a
write-up on them and most specifically
this little chart that shows you all of
the upcoming Zen 2 CPUs that we're
expecting to launch
Rison 5 Rison 7 and nano Rison 9 which
is going to be indicating the higher
core count CPUs from 12 to hopefully 16
core but they didn't actually confirm a
16 core quite yet it's only been from
the other channels that have confirmed
16 core not directly from AMD so we have
the 3600 at the bottom of the stack for
200 bucks that's a 6 core we also have a
3600 X at the 6 core 37 and 3800 X's are
8 cores and that's actually going to be
also probably a pretty compelling option
that 330 dollar 3700 X but regardless of
which of these CPUs you might want to
get you can't get them until next month
but what if you need a computer like
right now that is what my June build is
all about this is some $500 so it's a
minimal investment and it is Zen - ready
although I will point out that you will
need a BIOS update for the motherboard
in order to be ready for Zen -
unfortunately most of these BIOS updates
are already available and then the
second caveat is that one of the
features of Zen 2 in the horizon 3000
series of processors is PCI Express Gen
4 supports you will not get PCI Express
Gen 4 support with any existing and for
300 series or 400 series motherboard
this is something that AMD has just
recently confirmed there was speculation
that via BIOS updates they might be PCI
Express Gen 4 compatible but ambi has
said no if you hump these PCI Express
Gen 4 you've got to get a 500 series of
motherboards and those also aren't
available quite yet but you probably
don't need PCI Express Gen 4 there's
only going to be a few sort of edge case
scenarios such as if you're getting the
latest Navi graphics card when it
eventually launches and that may or may
not actually make use of the bandwidth
of PCI Express 4.0 and I'll
have some SSDs that are coming out some
MDOT to nvme SSDs that actually can
theoretically take advantage of that
extra bandwidth but those are also sort
of just being announced so chances are
you can get by just fine with a 400
series motherboard for right now so that
is why I have chosen the parts that I've
chosen here a total price currently is
four hundred and sixty seven dollars and
83 cents after a mail-in rebates but at
the heart of this build is the AMD risin
320 200 GB which I've recommended for
for a while now since it originally
launched because it's less than a
hundred dollars down to about 87 bucks
now and you get not only a quad core
processor but integrated graphics as
well so you don't need to worry about
splurging on a graphics card for the
time being and then when you upgrade
down the road upgrade your CPU upgrade
your GPU and you will go from a sort of
entry-level $500 build to a much more
powerful system of course you'll pay a
much more money for that but at least
for now
you will have a working system the
motherboard I've chosen is the ROG Strix
B 450 - eff gaming I've also frequently
recommended the MSI tomahawk B 450
motherboard but the ROG Strix one has
come down in price and I think it looks
a little bit nicer I does have a few
features that the MSI board doesn't have
although the power delivery on here is
maybe not quite as good as a tomahawk so
if you are looking to get one of those
eight cores or 12 cores an overclock
then maybe also still lean towards a
tomahawk tomahawks about $110 this board
is about a hundred and twenty dollars
but Asus also does a really good job at
keeping their boards up to date for the
newer series of processors and
everything so so there it is but you
know feel free to get the tomahawk - if
you'd rather have that one for memory we
have a g.skill ripjaws five kits this is
also one that I've recommended multiple
times before available for just seventy
eight dollars on Newegg ddr4 3200 and
you do want faster ddr4 memory if you're
pairing it with Rison and 16 gigs is
what I recommend right now a 2 by 8 gig
kit that will give you a couple more
memory slots available on the
motherboard if you decide to upgrade in
the future since the motherboard has 4
memory slots and you should be able to
plug in the XMP setting for this memory
to run it at 3200 speed and it's very
least if you're having any difficulty
hitting that speed you should be able to
run it at 29:33
for storage I was just going for
something that will be minimally priced
and for that you want about a 500 gig
class standard SATA SSD there are a few
that are cheaper than this one from a
data
it's about $55 but this one is gonna be
a little bit faster than those and is
their 800 series which is a little bit
nicer so for a few more bucks I felt
like this was a better choice than some
of those really cut rates you know 45
$50 500 gig SSDs for a case we have the
NZXT th 500 about a $70 case is kind of
what you're gonna be looking at in this
range there are cheaper cases but I find
them to often be lacking in features
this one has tempered glass tons of room
to work with inside the only downfall of
this case is that you are limited to a
single 120 millimeter fan that it ships
with so consider popping another one in
there just for standard airflow or of
course you can get more fans than that
and get it out fully if you want to and
then finally for a power supply we have
the corsair CX m 650 watt which is 80
plus bronze rated keep an eye out for
good deals on 80 plus gold rated power
supplies but 550 to 650 watts is all you
really need for a power supply
this one's partially modular so you
don't need to plug in all the cables and
the cables themselves are all black so
they're not going to stand out and look
ugly once your build is put together so
with this build you have some $500 full
sized ATX system with tons of upgrade
and expansion possibilities and my
recommendation would be to wait about a
month and then take a look at the Rison
3000 series processors that launch again
with the BIOS update you should be able
to drop them into this motherboard
there's really good six core a core and
12 core options on the horizon and we're
really excited about the potential
instructions per clock improvement that
we're getting with this new series of
CPUs as well as of course the
possibility of going upwards of 8 cores
since we do have a 12 core variant now
available and even the potential for
like a 16 core option down the line as
well
the final thing you need if you did that
upgrade would be to add a graphics card
as well and I will leave that to your
discretion because that's sort of a
separate discussion as far as what
graphics card you could go with anything
from the $300 to the maybe 5 to $700
range I think would be a good pairing
with this so I would opt for like an RT
X 2070 which he can get for around $500
but again maybe when Navi launches
whenever that actually happens that will
provide some more options as well for
now though let's take a look at my
second build which is the HTPC and I am
following up my original ultimate HD PC
build which is from July 16th 2017 now
which I have promised sup grade and do
updates on for quite some time so
basically
is sort of the updated parts list for my
ultimate htpc which I am planning and
continuing to do some work on and some
updated videos so stay tuned for those
when they become available but here's
what I've got in there or sort of what I
have in there and what I want to put in
there and please ignore the
compatibility warnings on here because I
already know that these parts are
compatible so for a CPU right now I
would go for the risin 5 2600 cuz it's a
6 core you know need a ton of cores and
an HTTP C processor but I do use this
system for gaming and direct gaming on
the system so for that at 2600 is a good
option the cooler is a no fancy r95 C
fanless CPU cooler and these are
actually pretty hard to find these days
but quiet PC USA does have them in stock
they're a bit expensive at about $115
but this one has been cooling my
actually I've actually I have a few
different processors under it so far and
it does a great job and there's no fan
included it's available in a sort of a
nickel finish as well as a copper finish
the only downside to this is that it is
only AM 3 compatible so that is why the
motherboard I'm using is still the Asus
crosshair 6 hero which is an X 370
motherboard which should still be
getting updates for the Rison 3000
series of processors so maybe next month
or so I will update the CPU in this
build once again but it also has a
pretty good audio solution with the
supreme effects audio lots of expansion
with SATA ports it's got that USB 3.1
gen2 pork on it's tons of i/o at the
back but one of the features that Asus
had on this board when they first
launched it was backwards compatibility
with a m3 CPU coolers so you can see
this is an actual actually an a m3 mount
here these sort of narrower ones that
you can see just behind it as the m4
mount so I need this board in order to
use the cooler that I want to use which
is the fanless one and that does mean
that if I wanted to update that HTPC for
rise in 3000 series and update the
motherboard as well I would either have
to ditch my CR 95 C fanless cooler which
I really don't want to do or I would
have to find a motherboard that it can
somehow mount to I did see some 500
series motherboards at Computex it had
Intel mounts I think but that was kind
of weird I'll have to look into that
some more but for the time being this is
the board I'm continuing to use for
memory I had this Corsair Vengeance lpx
kit ddr4 32
it's low-profile so it sits under the
cooler and works at 3200 feet with the
XMP settings on an AMD platform down to
85 bucks now which is which is super
nice for storage I want lots of SSD
storage basically for this parts list I
have dropped in the adata su 800 2
terabyte SSD cuz it's about $200 for 2
terabytes so that's a pretty reasonable
price this SSDs I'm actually using with
the system right now are different than
this but I'm probably gonna reconfigure
those once I go back to do the rebuild
for a graphics card my intent would be
to drop a 20 atti
into the build I was using a 1080 TI
back when that was the fastest graphics
card and that is what's currently still
installed on it but I will probably
eventually go with the 20 80 TI when I
update it - so here's an EVGA one for
the low low price of $1100 if you guys
are interested what the HTTP C looks
like right now or just about right now
there it is it's basically sitting on
top of my subwoofer collecting dust but
it's very functional and we've been
using it as an HTTP C my most recent
update video on this was back in
December but don't worry I'm gonna
update it again more I promise finally
for the power supply we have the inner
max digi fanless 550 watt because again
familis for HTTP cos trying to go as
familis as possible the only thing
currently in the build that has a fan on
it is the graphics card and the graphics
card has 0 fan mode so the fans don't
spin unless it's being used so most of
the time it is essentially a famous
solution the last things I would want to
add to this ultimate HTPC would probably
be an up-to-date current generation VR
headset valve just recently announced
the valve index it's supposed to be
coming in May but I don't know if
they've actually started shipping them
out quite yet and I did not put down a
pre-order for this so I might have to
try to get one somehow or maybe I will
still order one we'll see for now I do
have an HTC vive as well as an oculus
rift that I can continue to use and then
lastly I'm using the HD homerun prime
that supports a cable card so we have
cable service through our cable provider
you can drop the cable card into this
connect this to your network and then
any system on a network can access the
TV tuners on the card so you don't
necessarily have to have a TV tuner card
that's part of the HTTP C that you put
together
connect this to your network and then
it's much more versatile this one in
particular has three tuners so the HTTP
see can record up to three programs at
once and what I'm hopefully going to be
doing is integrating this with the
freenas so that the NASS can record
shows and save them there so that the
HTPC can stay off when it's not being
used because that would help save power
but guys those are my builds for this
month parts lists are down in the
description if you want to check them
out I will be back next month with some
updated builds featuring hopefully just
launched or about to launch rise in 3000
series stuff which i think is one of the
more exciting launches in recent memory
so I'm looking forward to that
hope you guys are - if you did enjoy
this video hit the thumbs up button on
your way outs and again links to
everything I talked about is down in the
description also don't forget to vote on
next month strawpoll thanks again for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
