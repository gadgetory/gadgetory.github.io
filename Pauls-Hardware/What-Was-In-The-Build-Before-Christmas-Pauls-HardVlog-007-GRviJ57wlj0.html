Paul's hardware I'm doing a quick vlog
style video because I know that's all
I'll have time for this weekend if you
guys were watching my channel you might
have seen the Christmas video that I
posted and thank you guys so much for
the amazing response from that video I
really was happy with how it turned out
and oh my gosh like all the likes all
the views everything like just so
amazing so merry Christmas everyone
happy new year and thanks for all the
love on that one but i did get also some
questions on that video and i also
needed to come out and say that i am a
big fat liar I'm sorry this is the
motherboard that I used in that video
and as you can see it's not in the
system I did do the video with this
motherboard but unfortunately it is
actually defective the cpu I'm sure is
fine and the other parts I think are
also good like the power supply but the
motherboard I think if we can get a
focus here the motherboard has some some
rust going on back here I think that
might have something to do with this
some corrosion so the mother more did
not last so I had to go with an
alternative the alternative being well I
didn't have another p67 board I didn't
have a z77 motherboards so basically I
couldn't use that 2500 k although it
rhymed so well in the poem but um I went
with an AMD system so actually this has
been working great so far it's got an
a-10 7700 k AP you in there and a
discrete graphics card with the GTX I'm
sorry not a GTX discrete graphics card
in the r7 260x apart from that let's
let's go over and run down real quick I
did some modifications here I added this
little gigabyte front panel USB 3.0
Loremaster century in case from quite a
few years ago and it didn't have USB 3.0
is that's my external SSD which has been
translated don't worry that was the
already dead motherboard anyway apart
from that I did add some bling this
little enter max TB Vegas fan especial
LEDs that you can
push this button on the back and cycle
through super oh look at that that's
beautiful just like Vegas I'm sure the
parents are going to be really happy at
that this is for metal nieces and
nephews by the way and their parents but
let's take a look inside actually all
right so inside the Zelman cpu fan is
still four is from their old system
because i had their old system here that
i used a few parts from and then the
motherboard in the back is an asrock FM
to a 88 x so it's a nice 88 x
motherboard i got eight gigs of corsair
ddr3 1600 memory i have that h is r7
260x right there and then the power
supplies and enermax maju 82 plus this
one is an 80 plus bronze one and this is
also from the old system for storage i
have that verbatim SSD which is 256 gig
it's only say a tattoo but it's still an
SSD so it's actually still really fast
and peppy and they're doing doing
anything fancy with it besides games and
stuff that's for the OS nother the
bottom we got a WD black 500 gigabyte
dread which is going to be very fast as
mechanical drives go and I wanted to
give them some nice solid reliable
backup storage and and and then the
other things for this little build here
are some accessories because like i said
i want to i kind of nudge them along
towards some pc gaming so i'm going to
drop in a xbox 360 wired USB controller
and i've been setting that up for them
i'm also i've got some some corsair I
think these are vengeance like 11
hundred a thousand thirteen hundred I
know there's some of the older vengeance
series a headset so I'm going to toss
that in as well and then not the
keyboard I'm sorry that's my keyboard
it's good it's got MX Browns on it
alright so and then finally some of the
software that I've setting them up with
so i installed steam for them and i got
them set up with an account and i
dropped in Super Meat Boy because it was
only 75 cents on the Steam sale then i
also got them portal the original portal
so they can try that out I got minecraft
on here so I'm sure the kids will be
happy with that and I got the little
language minecraft controller so they
can actually still use the USB for the
xbox 360 controller with it and then we
also have some emulators
so I did n64 and they've got mario kart
64 on there and then we've got nes
emulator that has a bunch of nes games
on it so they can play some old school
games as well which i'm sure that dad's
gonna be happy about I know he's he's
down with some of those okay I gotta get
this packed up and then we'll see if the
kids like it cuter yes you computer it
is oh that's exciting yay any possible
backs it's paper cords I got some cables
okay there's a drive rails in case you
install an additional three flight by
today hey that's the manga wow you can
see it
hey Anna remote control that's a
controller or so to bring my video to
resolution I have set up the system over
here these are my nephews let's imagine
hi say hi Matthew that's that's Lucas
and Lucas is right now playing mario
kart 64 use an n64 emulator we still
need another controller that I think
that would be cool to get because want
to set up some multiplayer here but
thanks everyone for watching this video
and dealing with my with me lying to you
all on that on my heartfelt Christmas
video and don't forget to subscribe and
like the video and everyone have a
fantastic new year I want to be back
