we're gonna enjoy this okay our week
streaming to vote now it should be live
to both I'm pulling a few tubes so I can
see what people yeah we're live all
right Wow what's a dirt there why is it
whoa
so much darker there hold on who cares
though hi everyone how's it going oh my
god we look like we're in a dungeon some
German dungeon porn streams welcome to
awesome hardware hey live show talk
about technology every tuesday evening
at 5:30 p.m. pacific time and really
sort of we're sort of engaging in this
thing where our production quality
steadily degrades over time or
drastically degrades over time i i've
been contributing to this with my audio
issues that we've had when we
broadcasted from my house
and you maybe maybe can't tell right now
but we're broadcasting from Kyle's house
with the first time ever way to throw me
under the bus so Adams now now it's
implanted in everyone's mind that my
house sucks now you look like you're
about to get murdered Natalie we had
equal you know poor experience at my
house - so that's true we had some audio
issues with you the other week now we
get video issues and audio issues with
me but you know what this this really
separates the true fans from from the
posers exactly though those of you who
just love Paula nice so much you're not
you're not detracted bye-bye inferior
video or audio quality you'll soak with
us through thick and thin alright and
trying to make it break and if that and
if the all this leads to to us having 23
some 23 followers or viewers by the end
of the stream then so be it but I have
confidence that a lot more of you will
stick around I think it's gonna be great
I got brighter I can also adjust the
saturation yeah I'm trying to make it
look like we're slightly less in a cave
so we were having issues streaming with
my fs7 my seven EFS seven which is like
a $7,000 camera looks really nice it's
what we've been streaming anytime you
stream the show from my old office that
wasn't working so we popped in the
second
best thing which was this c920 well it
looks so bright and washed out there and
then here it looks fun right there's
something else going on I don't know
there's some weird switch processing or
something like that and actually
something it's up it's actually not my
fs7 that's the problem it was the ripsaw
right it was deemed to be the ripsaw the
razor ripsaw external captured car that
we were using just wasn't taking the
feed properly from the camera wasn't
playing nice with our stuff so sorry
we're gonna get a ironed out for the
next time so apologies that we're late
and I apologize for the potato video
quality for right now it's just for this
episode yeah and it was this or nothing
honestly so let's move on
hey yeah it's nostalgic makes me feel
like we have 30 subscribers again I've
done I've done a streamer too with the
the 920 so there we go
and yeah I know how much time fuzzy it's
because like this happens if I move over
here and probably sharper now hey hey no
this is my Sharma is your personal speak
get room
get your in sharp area okay if you guys
aren't already impressed thank you for
the super chat innovation we're not
going to encourage you it's a debate
it's a buy stuff from our store it'll go
towards a background for the set my
story is Paul's talk weird that Nets
feel free to buy stuff there and help us
buy an actual camera what happen was
that transition what we have the the
collapse the collapse transition right
now why you don't like that is the
circle let's do the ezybounce next I
just realized I just caught it the tail
end of it I was like what the hell yeah
that's messing with that last time we
streaming from your office but this is
like a Windows Movie Maker stream yeah
or just using transitions from the 80s
thing so I mean the video quality looks
like it's from the 70s era but thank you
all right
my story's full surf right that net go
buy stuff bit with that tech slash doors
Cal store you can also buy stuff there
it's yeah it's real nice it's way better
quality than the video you're watching
right now like this one I'm wearing one
of Kyle's shirts right now all the
shirts come hyper credit although this
those are the ease bends that much what
about these is what it was called wait
wait for it it looks like it stutters it
looks like it struggles to transitions
why would you want that I don't know
these are nerd next up is ease in out
back which sounds kind of dirty our
house it is let's dive into some tech
news for my half oh my god
what happened the switch to the webcam
I'm still trying to switch back to the
ripsaw grips are not available
this is the best livestream ever do it
just switching out did we mention that
we occasionally swear on this live
stream oh yeah at the amount of
technical difficulties we're having
that's definitely going to come as a
warning very soon and we're really are
our main goal for this show is to reset
your expectations anything that we've
done in the past few years as we've been
live streaming the show that's may be
impressed year of make you think hey
they're doing a good job or have the
forethought into this we're trying to -
all that reset back to ground level so
that now we can do like minor things to
impress you guys again from here I know
you must destroy you must destroy in
order to create yeah
thank you so that's good to give you
more of an explanation but let's talk
about some techniques you first off we
have apparently a 12 core AMD Rison
processor which has appeared and a user
benchmark database entry
whoa so this once again is from the
infamous tomb of
Epis AK ton ipecac to map a sec who
originally posted this it is an AMD
engineering sample which has appeared in
the user benchmark database is still
there if you guys want to pull it up
links are in the description by the way
for the stories were talking about today
OC 3 D picked up this though pick pick
this up and they kind of went over some
of the details now it's still too early
to tell
obviously when these benchmark entries
come in they there are certain ways to
fake this type of thing so grain of salt
and everything but it does appear that
as was anticipated back in January when
AMD first showed off rising three stuff
or I'm sorry rising 3000 series
processors based on Zen tomb
architecture that the processor that
Lisa held up there had space for not
just a single eight core type of
possibly a second one so speculation is
that we'll have up to 16 cores and 32
threads on the mainstream Andy platform
in for sockets and everything this
benchmark entry seems to corroborate
that to some degree again assuming that
it is correct the entry itself used an
MD Myrtle system which is a code name
that has been used in the past to refer
to Andy I'm sorry a.m. for test
motherboards the actual sample name is
2d 3 2 1 2 BGM cwh 237 flash 34
underscore 10 rolls off the tongue which
we're all very familiar with according
to the article the D and the M in that
name which is is there is there a second
ago where you go oh it's right there the
V in the end in this name appeared
appear to indicate desktop for 1 then
the M I'm guessing maybe is mainstream
which means it was it's it's for the
ambien for platform that's how they're
deriving that information the actual
entry shows a 3.4 gigahertz base clock
in at 3.7 gigahertz boosts clock for
this engineering sample also of note is
an engineering samples in particular
engineering samples
that have database entries like this
often are running at lower frequencies
than their actual shipping frequencies
when the CPU actually launches so if you
think 3.7 gigahertz boost is slow then
while you're talking about more cores
for one but also it might actually run
faster than that one actually launches
also note is it that it used ddr4 2666
memory and you can sort of slow the
score the score entry is there for
single score quad-core and multi-core so
yeah hopefully that's true rumors that
we've talked about here on the live show
recently have indicated that if we're
expecting rise at 3000 series to launch
probably looking at like July maybe June
July my my money right now would be on a
like a formal announcements with some
demos and maybe some early information
at Computex followed by a launch a few
weeks later or a month later in July
it's not like they have something you
know what launches they've done in the
past yeah so that would make sense that
would be fairly reasonable and if you
want a comparison here at least I've
pulled up the multi score multi-core
score scores for these these tests on
user benchmark this engineering sample
scored 1741 in the in the multi-core
test a 2,700 X scores 1294 so from about
1300 up to about 1750 a 9900 k scores
about 1505 on average hmm so that's also
a decent jump up over the 9900 K which
would expect given that it has more
coarse 50% more cores and threads so
cool moving up right
do you guys ever use WinRAR I'm gonna
change that transition it's it's getting
a distraction
this check distracting let's do hold
whatever hole is trap hole well when are
the software that you download whenever
someone sends you a dot RAR file and
you're like why didn't they just make it
a dot zip now i have to download winrar
when winrar winrar kind of a tongue
twister yeah
when our i mean to its credit is
perfectly functional usable software
that does like to unpack many different
varieties of compressed files but one of
those compressed file types in
particular dot ACCE has presented a
vulnerability with the softwar software
and one that's actually been around for
about 14 years
oh good yeah and they've just now
patched it so the good news is they
patched it the bad news is you know
Bolton roller that's a vulnerability
there aren't any stories about like
people being crazy hacked by this or
anything but the vulnerability itself
was discovered by the security forum
security firm checkpoint software
basically a seee files are are
susceptible to this when are uses
third-party code libraries in order to
do unpacking of certain types of
compressed files so the one they used
for jce files is called an ace v2 DLL
which is a code library that hasn't been
updated since 2005 which is 14 years ago
so an AC file format is from win ace
it's designed specifically for win aced
on windows do you know when ace is when
ice hasn't been updated since 2005 so
that's why you probably haven't heard of
it it's a very old format okay but you
could take a winrar or an AC file and
you could I forget whether it's you take
a docker our file new rename it to AC e
or vice versa but one way or the other
you can take it you you can you can
winrar will take that file and if it's
created the right way to exploit this
vulnerability it will unpack an
executable into the system startup
folder they weren't able to initially do
that but then they can I used a few more
little tricks to get around that unpacks
an executable to the startup folder the
next time you restart the computer it
runs that executable code so of course
that could be any variety of you know
malicious software that n runs on your
system in a bad sort of way so good news
winner R has been patched the what they
did was basically dropped AC e support
because they said it has not been
updated since 2005 they do not have
access to the source so scored source
code so WinRAR no longer compatible AC
files so all of you dot AC e on your
windows a surjection fanatics probably
sad by that one anyway update winner are
and that's all a small price to pay
moving at one terabyte micro SD cards I
want a bunch of these micro huh micro I
see your phone so you can pop them in
your phone the really tiny ones a little
like fingernail-sized your phone are
your drone they can now yeah good for
drones good for like hero Pro or action
cameras like that mm-hmm
and man one terabyte on on that tiny
little that's insane tiny little thing
there micron and Western Digital in
particular have both unveiled one
terabyte micro SD memory cards they did
this at the Mobile World Congress event
yes
Barcelona which is going on right now
actually going on and through the 28th
they believe so there's a few other
stories we're going to talk about with
relation to that event and stuff that's
been announced there Lex are actually is
the first to market with one of these I
thought I had a link for that where you
go right right go didn't turn into a
link for some reason so Lex are actually
announced its back at CES and you can
actually order it right now so it's
available on B&amp;amp;H look at that Lex our
one terabyte hope you ain't chest this
is one this is an SDXC memory card
though not a micro SD but it's still one
terabyte card $400 actually shipping
March 6th or that's
expected availability according to B&amp;amp;H
photo video right here
damn micro wasn't same SD cards though
like thing even smaller should be
available they're gonna cost they're
gonna be expensive too available in
April sand disks is going to be the
SanDisk Extreme UHS - aye micro SD card
in April for $450 and it's assumed by
Western Digital that's what W DS part of
this micron does not have a price for
their one terabyte card which has also
been announced they say it's gonna be
available in the second quarter of 2019
WD knees SanDisk card has the faster
read speeds 160 megabytes per second
just pretty impressive that's right up
there with like a spinning mechanical
hard drive microns read speed is a
hundred megabytes per second which I
would lean towards the WD in that case
because like fine I've got 4k video and
I'm copying it off the card I want it
copy up the card faster yeah good the
micron card does have the advantage when
it comes to the write speeds though
because it does 95 megabytes per second
versus ninety megabytes per second on
the SanDisk one microns is using 96
layer 3d quad cell QL seen and we're
just just fun that's very funny
many many terminologies to apply to that
man's best man again does have the
faster rate speeds so there it is
these read and write speeds though pale
in comparison to the other thing that
was talked about at Mobile World
Congress which we're talking about on
Kyle's app of the show which is micro SD
Express cards which can do like nine
hundred and eighty-five megabytes per
second it's like double the speed of a
fast SATA SSD why that cows have though
which we blue we will be switching to in
just a few moments this means they'll
have to scale up the support for mobile
devices because I know a lot of like
phones and stuff will only take you know
micro SD cards up to 512 gigs for
example so there's gonna have to be some
sort of catch up process yeah I mean the
SDXC I think that standard does support
up
what a terabyte I don't know if it goes
beyond that
hmm but I believe SDXC can apply to both
full-size as a full-size standard SD
card as well as a micro SD card hmm I
could be wrong about that but let's hope
I think that's how it works okay
speaking of fast transfer of data to
something external USB 3.20
this just stimulates my body sb 3.2 is a
thing that will be absorbing the USB 3.0
and 3.1 standards that right that's
right yeah if you have any USB 3.0 or
3.1 device there will be a USB 3 point
to device that comes along and like eats
it and sort of consumes its and absorbs
its its Chi and energy and it's very
sexual and then you have USB 3.2 wrong
that's what I thought it was gonna
happen when I first read this article
but that's not actually how it works
oh that's too bad unfortunately the way
it actually works is stupid and
confusing no and it's just a matter of
them renaming things over and over again
in an effort apparently to confuse
people or something like that but for
example here did you know I think you
did but maybe you did or didn't like
right now we have USB 3.1 gen2 yes and
we have USB 3.1 gen2 you know what USB
3.1 gen2 on is it's just you as a
glorified USB 3.0 it is just USB 3.0
yeah the same yep they just renamed it
we're getting when they had USB 3.1 gen2
hashtag mark because you know adding dot
numbers after making decimal points and
adding generations makes things simpler
and easier to understand yeah so kind of
in the same way USB 3.0 which is
currently called USB 3.2 gen 2 by to you
following yeah you it uses the
reversibility of the USB 3.1 type C
cables as this picture shows right here
it used that to double the bandwidth so
basically increase the data throughput
so 3.2 gen
by two supports 20 gigabits per second
data streams but cannot be used with
standard USB type-c input/output designs
hmm
so that was not a question available
they yes but not to maintain that speed
be sure yeah of course you're talking
about sending all the glade announced
all the data
it's like taking a two-lane road and
making all the data flow one one way so
now you have twice as many lanes to send
that data down but now you can't drive
less yeah back way that from my
understanding okay
so just just just to clarify here that
for anyone who's still confused about
the terminology here I'm gonna quote
from the article incident wait wait no
I'm not cuz already said that so now USB
3.2 gen 1 is going to replace USB 3.0
and 3.1 gen 1 right so USB 3.0 was
originally USB 3.0 right then they made
a USB 3.1 gen2 have to be 3.1 gen2 came
out right now they're making it USB 3.2
gen 1 that's stupid let me repeat that
USB 3.0 is now USB 3.2 Gen 1 Y as well
as why would they be the big one that's
so stupid as well as USB 3.1 jinhwan are
they that so that it that contains the
the data the data speeds five gigabits
per second which was the original USB
3.0 as well as 10 gigabits per second
those will now be all grouped together
as USB 3.2 Gen 1 also still known as
SuperSpeed are they just trying to
confuse everyone because that's what
they're doing well because it's working
beautifully I'm already confused you've
explained it very clearly yeah what's -
yes I'm mad that USB 3.2 Gen 2 will be
replacing USB 3.1 gen2
no no it's like a nightmare it's like
this is an I think I had this nightmare
once it just woke up in a cold sweat
okay this is the word this is the most
fun story to go over and kind of make
notes for it like there's no hope of
actually explaining this to anyone
so then USB 3.2 gen 2x2 like that should
just that's 20 20 megabits per second
right David's gigabits per second
why don't like that should be called USB
3.1 gen2 by 2 you know any we like it
even that's not the most graceful but
what it makes logical sense but if 3.1
gen2 is 10 gigabits per second then 3.1
gen2 by 2 would be 20 gigabits per
second that makes logical sense as long
winded as those names are why I don't
even know where to begin
I there seems to be multiple alternative
ways that they could have named these
different connections and I pick the
worst one possible and it seems like
they chose something that's so obtuse
and confusing as to to to really spoil
this for anyone who's like somewhat
excited about next generation stuff like
I'm like if we're trying to look Silver
Lining or positive or whatever about
this like it's a new standard it doubles
the the transfer speed that's or the
bandwidth available at least like that's
good and impressive but knowing it like
getting a system that supports it and
device that supports it in both ways so
you can take advantage of all that might
be pretty confusing if this naming
holdeth like you're saying that the idea
that popped into my head just like me
having had a drink or two on the instant
right now whatever just USB 3 USB 3 5
USB 3 10 USB 3 20 you just named after
the speedy members at the end or the
speed yeah that differentiates it right
with different names but in the meeting
tells you the speed that it supports
because a lot of people you could say
USB 3.1 gen2 what's the what's the
bandwidth there a lot of people who
break I don't know like I don't even
know every time yeah sometimes I forget
it I have to remind myself right anyway
no yeah I mean none of this makes any
sense
this is this is stupid and annoying and
I I guess we're just gonna have to deal
with it but you know it's because the
people what's what's the group of people
who do all the USB shit the Universal
Serial businessman Universal Serial
businessman you know they're just a
bunch of Engineers like making all this
stuff up the USB implementers forum
right those guys they're just a bunch of
engineers which I'm sure they're very
knowledgeable and thank you for all of
your hard work engineers but I don't
know anything about marketing or how to
make something friendly to a consumer or
presentable to a consumer because this
is just garbage
yeah and the shitty thing is that
existing USB 3.0 devices are still going
to be listed at as their old names
they're not gonna update you know if you
go on Amazon overnight the package with
these new new terms so you're gonna have
both you can't you can it's gonna be
infinitely more confusing wait is that
is that updated or not you can't go risk
retcon the like descriptive terms stuff
that's been on store shelves for the
past year or two or something okay so
there you go guys USB 3.1 gen2 it's
gonna be gonna be awesome
so bittersweet let's move on we have a
new segment okay the new segment is
called price check Oh like the price is
right do I get a car if I win the idea
here is that we're gonna reality check
in real time live uber you guys at home
how much shit cost whole this is
something that you probably couldn't do
at home by yourself and apparently it's
sponsored by gamers Nexus S I'd still
love that picture where that come from I
guess please
come in come in late here because I made
this segment up like an hour ago and
have done a sponsorship so thank you
Steve where did we originally have that
picture from I posit a gamer's makes
this video adjust the rest of their face
just the right screen capped it and
tweeted it and you're like I'm gonna use
this one day I don't know what it's
gonna be more back and use it again
after the fact one day that day will
cover you go all right so we're doing
we're not some price checks here and the
things that I'm interested in price
checking are one the AMD Radeon 7
because that's been out for a couple
weeks now and we we had some information
some promises some early stuff about
like third-party versions of the cards
coming out and AMD assuring us that
there would be plenty of availability to
meet demand yep memory is a second one
and actually gamers Nexus posted to the
news video within the past 12 or 24
hours or so talking specifically about
an updated report from the people who
report about memory crisis saying
expecting like a 30% price drop mm-hmm
in q1 that's over the course of q1 so
we're gonna take a look at memory crisis
and then of course we have the recently
launched GTX 1660 TI which have you I
don't want to spoil it for Kyle since he
didn't get one but no I did not it's
it's $280 graphics card my question is
are they children needed are versions
out there are they available for sale
and and what are what are they I don't
know is that we're gonna take a look
there right and since I'm into it we're
gonna be using PC part picker because
yeah that's a great site for aggregating
prices of things I've already done a
search for the Radeon 7 right here and
wow this actually got worse since I
loaded it up there were two prices
listed when I first pulled this up
numbers laugh you'll note we got
gigabyte MSI issue sapphire XFX
as rock and power color here don't fool
yourself though all of these are the
same card they're the reference version
of the card we think have different
different manufacturers who sometimes
they put a sticker on the fan and you
know any least they put it in their box
yeah they put it in their boxes note
that it's there right we only have a
single one listed here with an actual
price which sometimes gives you hope if
you peruse PC part picture that it might
actually be for sale seems to be
available and Newegg just yeah well it
temporarily it sorry you block you block
so effective and it's not not in stock I
don't notify so despite these somewhat
mediocre and poor reviews of this card
when it first launched when it came to
its performance and especially its power
draw compared to some of the other
options available from Nvidia it doesn't
even seem to really matter much because
you can't can't buy it it's also unclear
as to how many units may be made yeah
but some people have been started
following this since the launch actually
happened and like I talked to AMD and I
I referenced this in a few like video
that we did with gamers Nexus and a
couple other ones because I heard from
AMD like there weren't plans for
third-party and board versions and there
was gonna be a limited run of cards
maybe that information came from someone
who hadn't received the PR like feel
that they were supposed to give to
everyone and I was getting more like
actual information versus the
information they wanted to talk about
but it does seem to be the case at this
point that the Radeon seven was very
much like a stopgap yeah I probably them
using Radeon instinctive GPUs that are
already out there and trying to sort of
repurpose them right so it still make
some money say that they were first to
market with a seven nanometer card but
it doesn't seem like the type of card
that has any long-term viability and
that would kind of be kidding I'm kind
of curious in the next three to six
months especially as other cards launch
like how much the Radeon seven is even
gonna play into like benchmark
performance comparisons yeah cuz like
does it matter to compare the
performance of a Radeon seven for any
out there when nobody can buy one and it
seems like very few people actually have
one it's already in a relevant card and
it's only been out a couple weeks mainly
because it was never really designed to
be a relevant card in the first place
apart from CES week that's when yeah
that's when it was
that's it was designed to attract people
to AMD during CES because they weren't
ready for their actual next-gen products
so they just rehashed last minute so so
there you go fresh check on the three on
seven is there is no price I guess there
are some being sold on Amazon possibly
but they're all like to destroy a
hundred dollars over Christ so those are
those are people who got like one or two
of them right Ridgeland when I launched
and they just have them up there for the
fear and I'm Sayla Creek there whether
they can make it two or three hundred
dollar profit on a single card next up
is memory memory man max so here I just
have a memory search going on we're
looking for ddr4 dims which is the 288
pin dims and if you're sorting by price
we're looking at a 2 byte 8 gig kits to
buy 18 internets of ddr4 memory we're
going for like 200 bucks five six months
ago yeah maybe a little less than that
for the lower speed ones but like this
is here for 2400 you've been able to get
one in for like 120 130 we've got a 2666
kit here for $85 that's pretty good
like two years ago I did a ddr4 kit that
was a good kid I think it was a 2666 or
maybe a little bit faster for like 90
bucks or something like that
so it does seem like we've kind of
dipped back down to kind of the low
points as far as that's good what was
available what's the absolute cheapest
kit that you could find like 70 to 75
bucks if you just need some ddr4 memory
and that's the capacity you want you can
get away with less than that if you go
like a four gig kid or something my
shirt 3000 speed memory currently
starting at 90 bucks
I am 92 $100 not bad let's look at 3200
speed memory all right you got paid
another 15 bucks for your 3200 speech so
looks like 3000 speed memory kind of
maybe the maybe the bang for your buck
right crosspoint there cuz there is
right overclocking that's a deep that's
a decent $15 jump to go up to 32 right
beyond that I like for me about 3200 is
still kind of gravy at this point right
I'm gonna just select a bunch of these
super extra go all the way up to 30 oh
that's good report doesn't it's great
it's gonna haven't let's live a little
so look here and this is always
something you should consider if you're
shopping for memory looking at let's say
you were looking for a 3200 speed kit
because you were like a 32 and it's big
kit that's what I want this is a 3600
speed kit that was a few bucks
pennies more 115 dollars more dollars
now granted this is a sniper exit kit
we'd have to double check you know
sniper X is good and stuff like that
ladies dance to the cat let's see what
really it's a little bit lower here but
you know the speed would kind of make up
for that to some degree so it's always
good to reality check higher speed
memory than what you're looking for just
to see if you know sometimes not a huge
your difference yeah might get a little
bit more than that right it does seem to
increase pretty quick after that though
the 125 140 yeah what is the those are
more enthusiasts kids 3733 Patriot Viper
kit for one's a weird speed that is a
weird I never see that in the BIOS under
the XMP often Amazon its capital C 17
though that's pretty fast
remember the the rising I'd be curious
about the rise in its compatibility yeah
and yes chats you can buy a lower speed
kit and overclock it but your mileage
may vary with that you know depending on
the I season and often up in like like I
I would often something like you know
buy something in try to overclock it
that I'm often trying to talk to people
who might not be comfortable with over
fucking so telling someone to go in and
like hey select the XMP value turn that
on most people could handle that in the
band right telling them to go in you
know increase your memory speed now go
into your timings or I try to loosen up
your timings and go through the testing
process of making sure things are stable
the other thing with memory is that with
memory overclocking I've had situations
where you can think you're stable and
start using the computer for a week or
so right and start to have really weird
issues that happen every so often and
then you want to turn that memory back
down oh yeah yeah yeah that's a
troubleshooting process to it it's not a
straightforward one last price check
we're gonna do here and that is again
for the sixteen sixty TI hey you'll $280
okay I feel like Nvidia price.this so
strategically it's like on the cusp of
saying like alright it's a pretty good
bang for your buck performance but also
on the cusp of saying like man I've got
a that could have made this 20 bucks
cheaper and it would have been like wow
this is awesome but instead you're like
oh it's 280 bucks maybe you should just
buy a 2060 right and whatever it's a
good not amazing anyway these are
ranging in price from $280 all the way
up to 325 330 like don't buy it don't do
that don't buy this 1660 ti4 $330 at
that point you really should just be
getting a 2016 yeah doing that but we do
have it looks like six different
versions for two $79.99 ACS gigabytes
otech gigabyte has to because you know
oh they have the Mini ITX in the
standard OC emma site has the ventus and
these do appear to be available in stock
for not nevermind temporary license or
they also about shouldn't be hold on
okay at least the ones I was looking at
earlier we're available DB G's yeah he
gazes in stock which which one did you
get buy right now for your video I got
the MSI but I got the gaming X okay and
I they didn't tell me what the price was
until like like 12 hours before the line
oh my so I really had to
that later I thought it was gonna be
maybe you know one of the standard 10 or
$20 increases but it was 30 bucks more
bright default price is 280 and the MS
and MSI gaming X is 310 which is a
pretty good jump yeah
so I had to add like a some text to my
video it's a kind of account for that to
some degree sure there are some like
dual fan versions down here at 280 bucks
though I like so tax got a little dual
fan it's a smaller one but it still has
a slightly larger cooler I would maybe
be record something like that but yeah
anyway so okay staying fairly true to
their promised radio Radeon 7p r zh' to
be a vaporware product yeah the 16 60 TI
at least does appear to be available for
anyone who wants to actually buy it and
it feels like that shouldn't be
something you have to consider when
you're talking about reviewing a
graphics card but these days it often is
it's crazy
anything in the card itself of course
yeah alright guys that's all I got for
my half of the show buta thank you so
much we're gonna close this down now
switch over to Kyle's half link to that
