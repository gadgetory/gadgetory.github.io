had a product arrived in the mail today
this is actually my new film this is the
LG optimus G so I'm just going to do a
quick unboxing of it because I have not
looked inside at all and wanted to do
that for you guys right here so starting
at the LG optimus G now I chose this
phone based on sort of a snap decision I
just wanted to kind of kind of I don't
know I was gonna I was going to go with
the samsung galaxy s3 then I was
thinking about the nexus 4 and
eventually I went this one and the
reason that I went with it I don't know
there's a few it's very similar to the
nexus 4 as far as the harbor goes they
both have the same processor in their
quad-core from Qualcomm it's fairly thin
fairly light um let's see what else
comes in the box here we have the LG tag
ok some documentation return bag for
your old cell phone unlike that we also
have USB cable to plug it in charge it
and we have the USB AC wall adapter of
course it's pretty much all it's in the
box take another look at the phone so
this has android 4.0 on right now that's
that's one of the big differences from
this one to the nexus 4 well i'm
probably going to end up rooting this or
doing something along those lines but it
would be nice if it came with like a
clean android 4.2 because that would get
the benefit of project butter which is
supposed to make the UI like really
smooth and really nice so if it gets
that upgraded that would be pretty cool
if not hopefully i'll try to figure out
a low down here anyway there's a little
bit of bloatware on this the sprint
version there's a lot more that comes on
the 18 tiver jie as well but this one
you there's just a couple sprint apps to
go in there which don't bother me too
much fortunately 4.7 inch 1280 by 768
display right there in the front
that's the same as the nexus 4 this is
really nice display though it's 320 PPI
it's got gorilla glass 2 which has a
feature that i really like 1.3 megapixel
front facing camera and 13-megapixel
rear-facing camera with LED flash got
sort of a black black design on the
bezel as you can see a volume rocker
here on this side over here we have a
headphone jack on the side is a power
button on the bottom a micro USB slots
you also have some Torx screws there in
the bottom so okay kind of cool-looking
and then speaker on the bottom here as
well LG logo of course LG logo on the
front as well another thing I'm hoping
this is going to do is with Twitter
because I like to take pictures
sometimes and post them on twitter you
can follow me there by the way it's at
Paul hardware with no s so then i'll
link it down in the description but for
taking pictures with that my old phone
which is right here which is you can see
fairly tiny also an LG but this phone is
getting pretty old and the camera is
pretty terrible so this should be a
really nice upgrade in that department
and yeah so i'm going to be playing with
this phone i'll bring you guys a full
review once I've had some time to mess
around with it thanks for watching
please subscribe and we'll see you next
time on pulse harbor</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
