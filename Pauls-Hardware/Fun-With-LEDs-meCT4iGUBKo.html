channel last week then you saw my garage
were clogged where I did a bunch of
cleaning and organizing but one of the
up shots was that I ended up with this
box labeled LEDs that is now full of
LEDs conveniently enough so today I'm
just gonna kind of play with LEDs for a
while that's really the long and short
of it I'll talk a little bit about LEDs
and what I know of them I'll do a
journey of discovery for stuff that I
don't know about them and I will ideally
be actually doing some LED lighting at
least in the top shelf here I'm probably
not gonna get everything done today
because what I want to do is try out
different solutions for setting up LED
lighting whether it's inside a case or
whether it's like LED accent lighting on
a desk I'm doing the desk version today
but what I originally planned was to get
the NZXT hue and actually set it up
connected to my computer so that when I
turn the computer on like all of the
lights lit up at the same time and then
I can go in and change the RGB settings
on them and everything I was gonna use
an NZXT hue plus for that I had actually
been in contact with NZXT about that but
I kind of dropped the ball and I didn't
request my sample in time and they ran
out and now even though I'm willing to
just buy them I can't find the damn
things anywhere so anyway point being
that today I'm just gonna kind of take
LEDs that I already have on hand I've
got some from cable mod although that's
an empty box but cable mod we've got
some BitFenix and I even have this right
here which is somehow the original NZXT
Q which is still not even been opened
before so I'll do some messing around
with that too and you know maybe I will
there'll be a resurgence of interest in
the original Q out of the box again this
is the old hue not the hue Plus which
means it's got a five and a quarter inch
bay adapter thingy up on here you can
use the three knobs red green and blue
to adjust the actual color so turning
the green knob will make there be more
green or less green for example same
goes for blue and red so like if you
turn the blue I imagine if you turn them
all all the way up it should turn white
right
the strip it comes with is also like
super long it's probably a good six feet
long total and then you can also do
stuff like is this deal Oh
pressing and hold the center button to
turn it on and off and then this button
here will cycle through different levels
of brightness so you can make it pretty
bright too or it goes back to dim and
then lastly this one you can tap to like
I go into like it's like crazy have a
heart attack mode
oh that's nicer fade in and fade out you
can do a color cycle just by switch or a
color cycle by fading as well so you got
all the basic kind of color modes you
have in there although honestly all I
really want to be able to do is just do
solid color lit up in the background
there and then be able to change that
color when I want to so this could be
also a viable option for that provide
just need to mount this unit like
underneath the desks at the edge so I
can actually have access to it let's
begin by answering a long debated
question which is when you have an RGB
LED strip like this one this is a cable
mod one by the way and you plug it into
a non RGB LED source what happens it
turns red most of the time when you have
LEDs at least most LEDs that are
designed to go in computers are going to
be 12 volt because that is the typical
voltage that most computers provide
they're able to provide 5 volts as well
but most of this stuff internally that
you see does use 12 volt but you should
check one way or another the easy way to
check if you have a 5 volt source it's
just to plug in the LED and turn it on
if you have a 12 volt LED plugged into a
5 volt source it will simply be dim
however if you have a 5 volt LED and you
plug it into a 12 volt source it will
die so that is something you should
definitely be aware of again most of
these LEDs are 12 volts but if you buy
off the like stuff from a store like
IKEA has an LED set that you can buy
those run on lower power 5 volt so
trying to interchange the two and the
same system will not work and that's
just something you should watch out for
the nice thing about other nice thing
about LEDs as you can daisy chain them
together although how many you can daisy
chain 2
there's gonna be based on well LED
strips themselves as well as wherever
your sources your source of power but I
could even do stuff like this now that's
interesting
this one is now trying to be white or
something I don't know what color it's
trying to be it's definitely not white
because that I can see maybe just trying
to be white it looks kind of red and
blue in there but that's it that's an
interesting that's interesting see I'm
learning things I don't know what I'm
learning but I'm learning something so
if I plug this in directly is it still
gonna be white this is an RGB one again
by the way nope plug it back in just
nothing's gonna happen that or I broke
something all right so I've got all not
all but a nice representation of the LED
strips that I have out here in front I'm
gonna go over each one from the bottom
of the top starting with this one this
is a longer one 60 centimeters long and
this is the cable mod RGB LED strip that
they sent over for me to use along with
the ASUS Maximus 8 formula which has an
RGB LED header now you'll notice apart
from this one being longer than the
others it well it's RGB although I'm not
plugging in an intern RGB source right
now so it's just gonna be red you also
know this like the spacing of the LEDs
you know they're fairly close together
that's something else you might look at
and then as far as connection goes this
one uses an adhesive strip so it's got
3m of material on the back you peel that
off to stick it to wherever you're gonna
stick it which works pretty well because
you can you know attach it to pretty
much any surface that would accept that
type of you know adhesive material
however you do have other options as
well so this one is also from cable mod
and this is one of their newer ones that
is part of their magnetic series so this
one's also RGB alright so again here you
got pretty much a 30 centimeter version
of this longer one here that I showed
you at first except you might notice
spaced out here they're actually magnets
that you can see through the films so if
you take something metal like my knife
right there hey it just it's it sticks
on to it that's it's pretty nice
magnetic LED strips are super handy if
you have a steel case don't use them
aluminum because they won't work with
aluminum but I definitely like them
guilmon is not the first ones to come
out with an RGB or with it well I don't
know if they're the first with an RGB
LED magnetic strip but this one here is
from BitFenix this is part of their
alchemy 2.0 series and I've had this one
for a little while though I haven't
really done much with it so far but this
one also has LEDs and well LEDs of
course this one also has magnets added
in there every so often this one happens
to be purple although that's available
in red green blue white and I think some
other colors as well but again this one
has the magnet so you can stick it in
whatever you want if you have something
metal you know it sticks to it so easy
to position in your case and move around
and all that good stuff Kyle actually on
his channel on us obsessed Network did a
pretty nice comparison between the
BitFenix and the cable mod RGB LED
strips the nice thing BitFenix did was
the actual cable extensions that came
with it they put in our they put a
magnet on that too right on that point
where it connects so that helps with
your cable management's as well which
yeah nice little bonus feature anyway
though that's the purple one from
BitFenix alchemy 2.0 now we're moving on
to more obscure ones that you probably
can't just get so we're moving into my
type a collection that I have curated
over the past couple years because I go
to Taiwan I wander into the electronic
stores I see LEDs and I might go LED
strips I should buy them this one is
blue although it is looking fairly white
on the camera so I don't know I don't
know what the deals with that it's
fairly bright as well the nice thing
about these is they're cheap they say
like three or four bucks each
two to four bucks I mean depending which
shop you go into in that kind of thing
you might notice though that you know
they don't look quite as nice just
looking at them they have that white
backing and then I have a couple other
ones here that one was blue but else I
have a couple other colors and these
other colors you know that since they're
white in the back and they're just
getting older they started to kind of
fade and discolor a little bit so if you
haven't positioned somewhere in the case
where you know that's not very visible
then you know that
be an issue but some to bear in mind and
you can tell why the company is selling
in the US have gone with this black
backing more recently but these of
course also available in different
colors and I've gotten a variety and
I've used them in a few different builds
and that kind of thing but there's a
nice green one one thing you might
notice if you're comparing these strips
they say for instance to this BitFenix
trip is going to be density of LEDs so
this one if you count them has 15 LEDs
going all the way across whereas these
only have 12 so that's another thing you
know where as you get what you pay for
you're paying a little a little bit less
money for these you get fewer LEDs but
they're still nice and bright and they
still work just fine so you know I'm
happy to have them however now that I'm
doing the RGB LED thing I'm gonna
probably find less use for them here's a
couple more kind of unique ones that I
found there that I picked up just last
year so you notice these do have the
black backing on them so you know most
of these are probably also manufactured
in Taiwan but so you know those those
places do have the cool manufacturing
techniques that give you the more
stealth looking background this one is a
double wide so it's pink which also
hopefully is showing up okay on camera
and you get two LEDs going on the whole
way so I mean that's kind of unique
although one of them is out there's one
out that's right there you see lastly we
have another black actually I have more
than these I have like stacks of these
bags here these are in the bags they
come in and stuff and I've tried to like
label them if you go into this I don't
know how many of you are gonna be in
Taiwan anytime soon but if you go into
the store most of the little electronic
stores have stations where you can bring
the LEDs you're gonna buy up to them and
plug them in and test them that way you
can verify what color they are and
everything but here's a nice green one
that I got which maybe I'll use in my
wife's build actually because I your
build might end up being green soon or
it might be orange in which case I can't
use this but um again that's just an
example of a very similar LED strip say
for instance to like the BitFenix very
close this one actually even has a
higher density of LEDs it's got one two
three four five six seven eight nine so
I'm so excited for 15 - 17 18 it says 18
LEDs so long that 30 centimeter strips
so obviously there's huge variety
available
you just gotta pick your poison so I
think what I've decided to do for now is
use the NZXT original huge it's got this
really long LED strip that I think will
work perfect at least for the top shelf
back there it's also got I need a
dependent control unit so I can easily
you know turn it on and off and adjust
the LEDs granted there you know remote
control units and that kind of stuff but
hey again I was trying to use what I
have here to get myself going rather
than having to go out and buy anything
or that kind of thing
in the same vein if you guys are looking
to set up LED lighting yourselves and
maybe you have already got the LEDs but
you're like I have the LEDs now what but
you're gonna need a power source so I've
got an old power supply here and this is
my ex-roommate's old systems power
supply that I pulled out it's a Z sonic
it's actually even 80 plus bronze rated
so I'm just have no problems here what I
would want coming off this is a molex
plug I don't have one but I do have SATA
plugs that's fine it's gonna work for me
because that's what the Q original hue
uses you would want to if you're doing
this run a molex plug off of there and
then you'd want to set up a basic little
solution kind of like this you get a
molex fan adapter these are very very
common to get along with computer cases
or just as accessories or you can you
know buy one online for a dollar or
something this has a lead coming off of
it for fan power just the red and the
black here the red is connected
incidentally to the yellow cable which
is 12 volts by the way on the molex plug
the yellow is 12 volt the red is 5 hold
the black sir ground anyway those two
are coming off that I had the 12 hole in
the ground and then I just splice them
together like I showed you guys earlier
splicing that and making sure I connect
the red to the line with the stripe on
it to connect the black to the ground
and then you should be just be able to
plug that in and run your LEDs at full
power full brightness power supply
you're going to need two jumper or hot
wire so to speak which is a fairly
common practice if you do PC building
but not all of you are probably familiar
with how to do it but you get a standard
power supply make sure it's not plugged
in unplugged and turned off ideally
you want to look at the 24 pin cable
here and you will notice a green wire
and look next to it there should be
black wires I usually the black I
usually use the black wire right next to
it but all the black wires are grounds
so any of those should work so in my
hand here I have a simple little piece
of paper clip I have clipped it down to
a very small size and I've kind of
crimped it into a little v-shape and I'm
gonna use that to basically jumper
between that green cable that I've
already located and one of the black
ground wires next to it I usually use
the one just to the right if you're
looking at the clip side and that's how
that works and then we will be safe and
we'll put a little bit piece of
electrical tape over the top of that
just to hold it in place and make sure
we've got some insulation at least a
little bit insulation over the top now
where your jumper now this power supply
is hot so to speaker it will be hot when
it's plugged in and turned on
anyway fan spins up power supply should
be on unless it's one of those fancy
power supplies with the fan doesn't spin
up unless you've unless you've actually
done something to it like making it get
hot all right so then I can just connect
my meseta power here tada and now I have
power for my LEDs right so I think last
thing I'm gonna do here is install these
back here and give you guys a look at
how it how it turns out
installation for the NZXT Hugh was dead
simple and I must say it's extremely
cathartic after having spent so much
time with these 3m strips like
protecting them and not using the
adhesive and be like I have to protect
the adhesive for when I actually use it
actually peeling it all off and sticking
it to the back of that shelf was pretty
nice it's working for me for now but I'm
definitely not like sold on it for sure
I will go over a few of the things that
I still want to do just looking at how
everything looks and I would have done
this all today but in all honesty it is
yeah I have to do my taxes this week and
my friend is getting married in a couple
months
and his bachelor party is also this week
so I'm pretty packed in as for our stuff
goes but don't worry I will be back on
over the weekend most like on Saturday
with a probing Pole episode so send me
some questions if you guys are
interested in that and in the meantime
what I will be doing in the future is
first off of course repositioning all
this foam back here it's not terrible
but it's not straight on this side and I
think I'm just gonna go all vertical
with all of it I think that'll look kind
of cool with the lights behind there not
sure what to do about this hot spot
right here on my metal wood protector
cover piece that's you know I don't know
I'll figure it out
the NZXT hue itself is sitting right
there which is not the best place for it
but it's there for now and I'm super
embarrassed that you can actually see
some of the ketchup and mustard cables
from the power supply there I'd like to
maybe undermount that whole thing down
here something like that and then of
course I do want to do lighting along
this lower shelf in the back as well but
this was kind of a tester and just
playing around with LEDs and having a
good time that's all for this video I
had a ton of fun I hope you guys did as
well if you did do me a solid and hit
the thumbs up button down there also
down in the section down below you can
leave me a comment let me know what you
thought of this video and if you have
any ideas of what I should do with my
RGB or LED solutions in the future also
you can check out the links in the
description for my amazon link which you
can click before you shop at Amazon that
is an awesome way to help me out or you
can check out my store store that pulls
over at net where you can buy
shirts mugs print glasses else oh now
have a zip up Hoodie as well as some
polo shirts and have a brand new shirt
coming out next week so I'm very excited
about that one thanks again for watching
everyone and we'll see you next time
and that will allow me to look at the
pennant the min itself also it allowed
me to snap things off and hit myself in
the eye I'm gonna leave that in because
that was unplanned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
