Harbor today I'm going to be doing an
unboxing and overview of this quad
channel memory kit from g.skill this is
the G scale Trident X series 4x4
gigabyte to 2400 speed ddr3 memory kit
so let's take a closer look at the G
scale Trident X quad channel memory kit
there you can see it in its retail
packaging it is pretty much a red and
black color scheme again this is a quad
channel kit so you'll see stuff like
designed 4x17 that I designed for x79
sandy bridge-e quad channel this is of
course just as at home in a dual channel
configuration so if you got for instance
the Sandy Bridge or an Ivy Bridge
processor or if you're running an AMD
processor that of course also uses dual
channel configurations this will work
just as well now the speed rating here
2400 is going to be very dependent on
your memory controller the memory
controller is part of your processor at
least with modern processors that's how
it works so Ivy Bridge very very good
memory controllers so if you're rocking
a third generation Intel Core processor
chances are you gonna be able to run
these as at its rated speed at work we
have some of the 2666 kits and those
just as equally are just as equally
suited for high D bridge and actually
all of the Ivy Bridge processors that
I've tested so far which is 35 70 K and
a 3770k
have been able to around the 2666 kits
at the rated speed so here's the insert
of course so actually you have either of
the extreme edition i7 right there so
that's going to be sandy bridge-e
of course you also got standard Ivy
Bridge logo right there designed for
third generation Intel Core processors
and z77 platform okay so maybe they're
not talking about x79 but it'll work
just as well next 79 anyway before I get
too distracted this is the kit
information as you can hopefully read
right off of there ddr3 2400 PC 319 200
people ask me what the difference is
between these two numbers basically the
second number here is
multiplied by the prefetch buffer which
is a factor of eight with ddr3 so
basically if you take that number
divided by eight it should be 2400 is
that correct 19 200 divided by 8 8 goes
into 19 twice that's 2 with the
remainder of 3
3,200 eight goes into 32 for 2400 yes
see my math works
you guys probably all did that in your
head like a minute before I did anyway
apart from the speed of course and by
the way is just to follow up on people
asking me about the difference between
these two I pretty much ignore the big
number I think the big number is just
there for marketing purposes I only
focus on the 2,400 so I'll say this
memory kid is 1600 or 2,400 or something
like that anyway this is a 4 by 4 gig
kit so it gives you 16 gig stole 4096
megabytes per stick of course and then
our timings here cast latency of 10 12
12 31 1.6 5 volt here's some extra
information from g.skill about how
awesome these memory kits are these are
the top of the line memory kits pretty
much and its really the fastest memory
that I've gotten my hands on to date
apart from that little insert there you
also get a g.skill little case badge
there if you want to advertise for
g.skill on your case or if you just like
collecting the case badges I have a
collection of case badges and I'm sure
at some point in the future
I'm totally gonna put them all somewhere
all right here's a kid itself you get
four of these they're all identical
things that I like about this kit an
actual black PCB on the memory itself
right there you'll find kits that are
really cool heat spreaders on them and
then you look and it's just got that old
kind of get a look in green PCB or they
even like a turquoise PCB underneath it
and if you're picky about colors in your
case well a little bit of green sticking
out the side might just be a pet peeve I
don't know depends on what kind of build
I'm working on to be perfectly honest
but coming back to what I like about
these sticks apart from the black PCB of
course I do like the heat spreader I do
like the color scheme that they've gone
with the heat spreader has this red part
on top and this thing is actually quite
sharp in fact this would be one drawback
to this kid if I'm gonna be nitpicking
is these two points are here actually
quite sharp you could easily cut
yourself on them or at least poke
yourself these in the middle not quite
so much but do be careful of those but
the heat spreader does work quite well
keeps keeps the sticks nice and cool
dissipates the heat gives it a pretty
tough look matches really nice I should
say with asus rog gear of course and i
think that's probably what maybe they
were going for with this one but also in
any sort of black themed case or black
and red of course but you will notice
the heights so you do have some extra
height compared to the top of the actual
PCB which is right there heat spreader
itself but if he's noticed there's a
small screw right there let me just get
my small screwdriver and I'll pop this
in and here is a nice thoughtful thing I
feel like g.skill has done with this
kits is that they let you remove both of
these screws and if you do have let's
say your your stick of memory that's
closest to your CPU and you've got an
air cooler well just go like that tada
so the top part of the heat spreader is
removable now I will say that when you
do remove this top heat spreader just
the memory looks well truncated I don't
know how to describe it the memory
doesn't look quite as fierce as it did
before not quite as badass but it's
still there it's look at the black heat
spreader it's still got the tray 10x so
I'm guessing probably not too many
people are going to set up these kits
take off all the heat spreaders and run
them like that but let's say you do have
that one stick that's too close to your
air cooler and you got a big fat air
cooler with a fan that sticks out and
you need just a little bit more space
well you can pop that off of the one
stick that's closest to your memory I
think it still looks okay that way since
it's underneath the the like an air
cooler anyway and does give you a bit
more flexibility which is always nice to
have and that is gonna wrap it up for
this video guys once again this has been
my unboxing and quick overview of the G
scale Trident X quad channel memory
and this definitely falls into the
category of one of the products that
I've handled and gotten to play around
with a bit on our new ITV YouTube
channel that's my day job and I've
decided to take a second look here on my
channel because it is one of my favorite
products over the past year so you've
been watching Paul's hardware if you'd
like to see more tech videos and
unboxings you can find them on my Paul's
Hardware YouTube channel don't forget to
subscribe toss me a like if you enjoyed
this video and we'll see you all next
