YouTube which is good it's always a good
it's always good to be live to YouTube
hey YouTube hate switch how is everyone
doing today
welcome to awesome hardware this is a
live show we stream every Tuesday
evening we discuss technology computers
computer parts as well as just any
random stuff that pops into our heads so
thank you for joining us whether you're
watching live on Twitch twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware or my channel pulse
Hardware welcome thank you for joining
us or if you're watching oh no did my

that good stuff
I am updating the after party after
party is going to start at the end of my
half of the show and it's always a good
time always but I put the wrong time for
the start and it's also still unlisted
so I'm just updating that I was pretty
good on my half hour I think well maybe
I went 3540 but I don't think that's
true no did I go too long that's true
sorry it must be the glitching it was a
glitching so oh also sorry Kyle's
glitching it's really I'm fine
like I can move around and stuff nothing
wrong mainly my arm whenever Kyle moves
he's he's glitched out part of the
matrix I can't figure out exactly what
is happening on today's show yeah maybe
it was cuz we did a live 12 hour
livestream I'm just just on on Saturday
that was fun but anyway it broke me I'm
sure you guys are impressed so help
support our endeavors by buying stuff at
our stores Paul sorry Burnett is my
store
you can still order now in time for
Christmas delivery if you want to buy
presents for loved ones also having a
deal 10% off of orders over fifty bucks
twenty percent off of orders over $100
and there's a wide variety of high
quality merchandise you can purchase and
obtain yourself including organic cotton
beanies as well as the new Robo love
design which is plastered across a a
multitude of products oh yeah of course
if you buy awesome hardware merch from
either of our stores my store at Paul's
Arbor at net or Kyl start bit mate not
tech slash store we will split the
profits so supports us both Cal's got
the same holiday discount deal going and
it's got some new merch too including
the 8 bit boy blaster which is available
on gaming mouse pads and ceramic mugs
and it's all super nice stuff so thanks
to all you guys for supporting us and if
you buy stuff we will shout out your
name during the after party as we do
Johnson's yes in order to thank you for
your support we knew it how that works
all right let's let's dive back into
some some technology news here starting
up with with RAM prices they were
supposed to put news news RAM prices
there it is yes Ram prices we've talked
a lot about pricing of various computing
computer parts in the past couple months
because there's been a lot of volatility
in the market with GPU prices finally
coming down SSD prices finally coming
down this article is from trend force I
actually sourced this via gamers Nexus
because they discussed this earlier in
the week but the contract prices of DRAM
products have started to slide since the
fourth quarter of 2018 that's what we're
in right now that started in October and
om now having a negative outlook on the
market and the price falls are expected
to enlarge in the first quarter of 2019
so RAM prices are good and according to
this article they're supposed to be
better of course we're also in the u.s.
at least expecting some tariff
situations possibly to engage come
January so we're still up in the air
about that and how that's going to
affect it but whether they counteract or
anything like that
this at least is good news for anyone
who's interested in
interested in buying RAM the dram
exchange is reporting that the first
quarter in 2019 could yield another 10%
drop and dust desktop Ram prices so cool
and that is due to the fact that the
market currently has an oversupply of
memory and manufacturers are still
continuing to increase output and demand
for DRAM which apparently was very high
for the past couple years has been
sluggish so people don't need as much
memory maybe I don't know if demand
dropped off because the prices were so
high it's hard hard to gauge when it
comes to muscle but my neck raises died
down a lot so my name craze has died
down so at least for like gee DDR memory
and that type of thing but anyway
there's also another factor here which
is the investigation into price fixing
in China and that is ongoing so still
potentially more to come there but
hopefully 2019 outlook for memory prices
at least this is a little bit rosier
moving on 3dmark we already kind of
mentioned that they announced teased
this upcoming portroyal benchmark which
is going to be added to the 3dmark suite
of benchmarks this was actually
announced last month that it would
announce that it would launch in January
the update here is simply that it's
gonna launch January 8th so we have a
specific date rather than simply a month
that's cool that's more specific yeah so
this is gonna offer comparisons of
real-time rate racing performance for
any graphics card that supports
Microsoft DirectX ray-tracing so as of
now that includes arc GX 20 70s 20 80s
and 20 ATT is soon to be r-tx 2016 yes
potentially as well I mean it was that
wait was that included
pay attention to that part let me see
what the 20/60 say it would support ray
tracing
hardware ray tracing oh it didn't say
that so I shouldn't say that
nevermind you heard it here no you
didn't hear it you didn't hear it
nothing nothing the demo picture the
demo video here which of attraction that
does look really cool that's right mooks
is kind about did you see how cool it
looks lots of shiny reflective objects
and and all that look at all the Rays I
mean look at all the Rays being traced
just right now there's at least 10
degrees in there the demo video here is
2560 by 1440 just a just bit of extra
info and then after January 8th if you
buy the 3d mark Advanced Edition which
costs $30 us you will get portroyal
included if you already own 3d mark like
me and me and Kyle you can buy it for a
mere $2.99 why so I'm glad they're not
charging a massive I'm gonna come a
upgrade for you also wonder how much
Galax paid for that brand integration oh
Galax always they always I know they do
but I wonder how much let that runs for
with what if I wanted bit wait grab how
much it would cost yeah I don't know
yeah we have to get in touch with 3d
mark and see what their what their prey
get one for awesome hardware right there
so I mean I'm just happy that it lasts
there will truly be a reason to invest
in like an RT X 28 ETI because I mean
obviously we've had this poor attempts
of ray tracing and games like
Battlefield 5 and empty promises from
shadow of the Tomb Raider but now the
final intended purpose which is to run
benchmarks against various graphics
cards in a you know on Rails demo that
requires no human interaction and that's
really what it's what we're bounce with
what it's all about when it comes to
high-end graphics cards that's a we love
about benchmarking most it's not having
to benchmark I'm I'm semi erect right
now just thinking of it
tables lifted Oh also also sub note if
you if you subscribe to the 3d mark
professional Edition which costs
fourteen hundred and one thousand four
hundred and ninety five dollars that's
the professional Edition
which fortunately Kyle and I are not
professionals so we don't need that
addition we're okay with the $30 version
but yes you you will also get this if
you're paying 3dmark $1500 for their
software moving on them
the feds feds the feds this is a little
bit a little bit update on net
neutrality you haven't brought up net
neutrality in a bit net neutrality is
currently not being enforced by the FCC
due to the actions of one ajit pi as
well as others involved in there but
there is an investigating that's sort of
spooling up the US Justice Department is
investigating whether crimes were
committed when potentially millions of
people's identities were posted to the
FCC's website without their permission
because the FCC when they were when they
did what is called a notice of proposed
rulemaking in order to rollback their
decision they made in 2015 to enforce
net neutrality by classifying Internet
service providers as title two service
providers under the Telecommunications
Act of is it that name any better point
being when they did this they had to
open up commentary from the public
people United States citizens were
supposed to go and say like yes I think
that neutrality is good or because of
this reason or no net neutrality sucks
or whatever between what actually
happened was there was a bunch of people
whose identities were stolen and/or
their identities were used to post fake
comments the comments and in general
were sort of all messed up anyway
because like if you listen to what a
Jeep I said he's like well I'm only
gonna listen to comments that provide
like legal ground like the legal grounds
for this like I don't I don't care what
people I don't care what people care
about this I care about like someone
coming at me with something legally
speaking but anyway so the point is the
FBI has issued subpoenas in order to get
more information from the FCC the FCC
has previously also been subpoenaed by
our state this is the feds the US
Justice Department federal federal law
apparently the scope of the subpoenas is
similar but this comment
scheme or the fake comments took place
over the course of the months beginning
in April 2017 after the Trump
administration's FCC chair Ajit PI moved
to overturn Obama era rules and forcing
net neutrality so sorry just just to
clarify I'm a little cat these were the
comments that they posted fraudulently I
guess were they all comments against net
neutrality this is this is why this
information is being requested and now
being forced to be subpoenaed gotcha
because the FCC has been very very
hesitant or not helpful or basically
told people to go you know f off
yeah when they're asked for this
information they have not been providing
it voluntarily okay so people had to go
through other means in order to force
them to do that right more than 20
million comments were filed leading up
to that decision in 2017 and the New
York Attorney General's Office estimates
up to nine point five million so nearly
half of them were filed in people's
names without their consent Jesus
there's lots of people who like looks
because it's and it was a public system
so that's that's why there's a there's a
privacy issue here if some shady
organization or whoever whatever
whatever shady people were posting these
comments fraudulently in the name of
other people we're also posting on the
FCC's reporting tool which anyone could
go in and look at publicly right so
people who weren't even weren't even
probably aware of this situation we're
having their name and information posted
which is which is impetus for this going
on right now pie stuck oh and and and
then there's a follow up so I mean
that's obviously a crappy situation but
I guess good that it's being
investigated more and then I follow up
here from Eric from ARS technica a GTI
has buried a two-year-old speedtest data
in the appendix of a seven hundred and
sixty-two page report
this is the communications marketplace
report that the FCC works on which they
stopped publishing as of December 1st
2016 they basically didn't publish it
for a couple years they finally have but
they did it in a way by taking the 2017
and 2018 reports and smashing them
together and then taking the actual
information about the this is this is
monitoring broadband internet service
providers for their advertised speeds so
if you're a if you're somebody in the
United States who pays a broadband
internet service provider for and they
say you know you're gonna get 10 Meg's
down and five up or whatever they're
testing this is this is them testing to
make sure that you're getting what you
pay for right which seems reasonable to
me
they stopped publishing this at all back
in and at the end of 2016
finally they have published the reports
for both 2017 and 2018 there is the
issue that the 2017 report the actual
that if you actually read it is very
clearly was written in 2017 and there's
no explanation why the information
wasn't released and then there's the
fact that the actual broadband
measurement reports are buried on page
349 in appendix F 1 of the 2018 report
I've had the 2017 report and appendix F
2 page 463 of the 2018 report the
reports themselves charts at least can
be seen in the article on ARS technica
and this green line here is indicates
100% of the promised performance and
then all dogs barking so hundred percent
is here and then what the actual
provided services see is below that so
if I had AT&amp;amp;T DSL service right you
might be a little upset if you had their
IP APB B service hey it might be kind of
happy that the verizon list here is
actually for two separate services they
offer so there was one that
underperformed and there was one that
over performed that's why those overlap
and there's some others here that
actually seems like performed well so
that's why
it's kind of weird like it seems like
this what's Hughes Hughes hooked me up
with that Hughes service he's apparently
is awesome I'd love to be he just
customer for sign me up so yeah anyway
if you guys are interested in these
reports the charts are again listed in
the video description or the articles
linked in the description you can check
out the tricks um selves to fair enough
alright let's move up China no China
okay
back in August they announced that there
is a new body and in there a state
administration of the State
Administration of press and publications
which is taken over responsibility for
approving games video games in specific
so there's good professors well they've
just recently state media has reported
first the first twenty titles assessed
by this agency Wow and nine of them why
they say are they they're bad Wow bad
and they cannot so that's half fifty
first only half of games getting yeah
through the gate nine have been refused
permission to go on sale eleven had it
recommended changes and one of them was
Mario Party now this general article is
from BBC which talks about some of these
things although it doesn't get into the
specifics about games there's also a
reddit page that has a little bit more
go away reddit it has a little bit more
investigation here in some posts now
this is a reddit posts and they're
posting a link to this image which isn't
an untranslated source so this is not
basically this here is not verified so
great assault for this information here
but this is the translated information
about the games themselves so for
instance arena valor by ten cents
League of Legends so for for the for
some of them they have corrective action
listed needs to be edited in some way
they need to change in league of legends
they have overly revealing female
characters and rewards given based on
rank and oh and an inharmonious chat
room everyone needs to you know the
melody in the harem
they need to get back on top of that so
corrective actions these games can
change themselves or makes them edits in
order to be made acceptable in China pub
G however due to blood and gore is
prohibited the bloody same with
fortnight's fortnight blood and gore
Volger cunt I've never seen any blood
and gory notice like a cartoon
it's like rated E that has been
prohibited maybe the same with h1z1
alliance of valiant arms ring of Elysium
talat in the house for tonight vulgar at
all yeah so I I don't know I'm confused
by the white everyone everyone here
should wish that we had you know
benevolence you know in part of ours of
our governments that would come and tell
us what games are okay and not okay to
play I never moved to join pletely band
the ones that are not okay just for this
reason anyway just just an interesting
bit of what's going on across the
Pacific I suppose let's move on though
please and talk about something more
positive
Kyle and I did an extra life charity
events on Saturday we were playing video
games for 12 hours straight you're damn
right I got really tired by the end news
staring but we had a great time we
raised over $20,000 for the Children's
Hospital of Los Angeles and we promised
at the end of that that we would come
back because most of the donations were
going through the extra life donation
portal here and this is our awesome
hardware team and the total donation
amount it's actually got up a little bit
we've had a couple more hundred more
Dell dollar nice couple hundred board
thanks guys dollars in donations come
through so thinking L so much again
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles is
where these donations were going and
this isn't all because we also had
people because we were live streaming to
twitch as well as YouTube and we had a
lot of YouTube super chats come in as
well so I had the opportunity to go and
add mine up and I can I'm gonna be
dropping another one thousand one
hundred and seventy three dollars and
six cents on top of this I'm out right
here yeah
you know my super chant did you have
yours too yes my super chat total was
very close to yours thirteen hundred and
forty three dollars so adding both of
those figures up to our twenty thousand
that's that's about twenty three
thousand dollars ears 1343 yeah
thirteen forty three plus one one seven
three for me
plus the twenty thousand the name of
this segment is called yes eighty we're
using the calculator tool here from
Windows 10 here it is
twenty three thousand one hundred ninety
six dollars it's not bad at all I mean
we we were dangerously close to 25k here
I think overall so we just wanted to
report that to you guys and to say thank
you to any of you guys who were able to
join us during that livestream and
especially to those of you were able to
donate you guys are awesome and we're we
have three computer systems that we're
giving away donations were not required
for that they were merely suggested and
those three giveaways are open through
the end of this week so you guys can
still go and enter those word if you
want the links are still in the streams
from YouTube you have the description
the descriptions of those so feel free
to do that
alright I don't need to do this I'm
gonna do it anyway
what sponsor spot hey technically I've
already done on my tab partners I'm
gonna do it I'm gonna do it anyway
needy free so she was getting bonus Kyle
did his on his hat because he forgot
what I did I made a point though where
just make it up anyway Toshiba sponsored
awesome hardware in the end the final
months of this year we wanted to say
thank you to them we are advertising
their BICS flash based products like
this excess of an excess 700 external a
says the the TR 200 internal 2.5 inch
SSD as well as the RC 100 little m dot
220 240 to drive because I'm links to
all three of these in the video's
description they're reasonably priced
and they're fast and you know everyone
needs good SSD storage so check it out
and thanks Toshiba Chris sponsor us mark
alright next up I don't know debates not
available Toshiba I can fix it
fix it I always forget and I look at
Chad they're all waiting for me mr.
Shima just all in chat all right there
it is I fix it there you guys go
time for ask to the audience ask the
audience for a while I know this is fun
getting some feedback what are we asking
them to date if we have three questions
we're gonna ask you guys about we're
gonna will pitch the first one or two
and we have some straw polls for you
guys to vote on and Kyle and I will will
gauge what we think your response will
be and then we'll find out what it is
cool that's pretty yes so the first
story we're going to talk about here is
some new cameras some new phones and
phone cameras coming out your phone that
have cameras built into them of course
as as naturally way the phones work
today's follow the highway honor of you
20 and the Samsung a 8s and they have
this new this new fancy new design what
is being dubbed the hole punch camera so
here we can see it the hideous notch is
it introduced by many phone camera phone
makers who notch at the top for a camera
and a speaker and whatever else
yep nope this new thing and this is from
Samsung is this is a hole punch so just
a little video screen just a little
picture right there right so that's so
much better than ah chair this is so
there's there's the hole punch right yep
up in the corner right I was looking at
this and thinking to myself I am not
sure what to think we should ask the
audience so you guys can vote on this
right here hole punch cameras are they
acceptable versus the notch let us know
what you think in chat I'm gonna phone
app Asus and chat right now I think I
can do that of course I can yes there we
go
so guys motive mode if you want this is
a dumb question it's not a dumb question
easy answer right here well we're trying
to we got to start with these simpler
ones and then we build up okay to the
fancier ones where I'm going to and in
ask the audience fashion we're gonna try
to guess what percentage or whatever of
the audience guessed what oh service
here Thanks thank you sell sells also
posting
much obliged cell sorry I'll be quiet
and clipping who are you just saying
we're supposed to guess what the
audience might might think right we're
supposed to guess beated the audiences
yes yes the audience in this room but
before any of that let's ask the second
question as well so people should weigh
in on both no can give a little bit more
time all right so this was a story we
brought up on Kyle's half of the show
which is Corsair making fake memory fake
dims actually just dummy dims basically
if you have a slot of four dimm slots or
eight game slots or whatever you have
with your system configuration and
you're only populating half of those
slots with fancy RGB light up memory and
like you don't want to spend the money
or you don't need the extra sticks for
the other slots but you really want that
Universal look with all of them
populated and lit up you could get these
fake dims 40 bucks for a pair of them
they plug in and connect so you can get
the lighting there's just no actually
actual memory there are those fake gold
contacts then well they would still need
the contacts because there is still data
transferred through there to control the
LEDs for powering yeah so there's
something going on there I'm actually
I've actually kind of curious how that
how that all works for them but yeah so
second question we're asking the
audience today this is if you're
interested you guys want do you guys
want these dims do you want the art that
RGB goodness such a nice mix it up and
do you appreciate this as a product
that's available now that you could buy
and use or do you think it's dumb and
stupid or other some other variant of
that but in the meantime while you guys
vote on that one and these are the
important questions that need to be
answered folks yeah it's very important
you're doing market research right now
yes I did already talked about this on
my half you are correct but now we're
out now we're getting feedback we value
your opinion
yeah we're adding information right
information from you guys right so what
do you think Cal hole punch cameras I'm
gonna answer this honestly yes they are
way less noticeable we have to say how
much the audience so what give it a give
a percentage and also it always depends
on what you've written how you've warded
the other oh yeah very tricky
very tricky I'm gonna say 7d 70% yes way
less noticeable yeah okay I think
they're with me on this one I'm gonna
play the odds and say 69% Wow
bold daring do I know just had to go
yeah you had to go prices where I could
go thank you notes
I could go with 69% possibility of being
right alright you go with it I'm just it
is it is the best number of strategy 0
to 100 so I can't fault you there
alright let's see what the audience
thinks of this one oh damn you are quite
close you chose right to go low and it's
starting to dip though I almost said 65
I was so close to saying students at 65
and that whatever one was 64 yeah you
still would have won you dick but I mean
you're pretty close to yeah you gotta
get you gotta give I give you credit
your answer is only based on my answer
for that that's true I'll answer first
in the next round alright before we do
the next round we have one third
question to ask the audience since I
have to take a drink right oh yeah
definitely drink so recently the past
week week-and-a-half there have been a
bunch of AMD Zen - and Navi room Zen -
CPU and Navi GPU rumors going around you
you're up on this stuff Cal right yes
yeah we've talked about this briefly
last week this actually I was all
sourced from a photo by Outdoor TV and
there's you know it is rife with
information there's tons of info there
when it comes to what was leaked but of
course it's all leaked information
sure not confirmed by AMD and DS comment
on this is that they do not comment on
rumors and comment is no comment
yeah something like that so yeah you've
got Navi based graphics cards the RX 38
e RX 37 t &amp;amp; RX 36 t supposes graphics
cards coming out the 38 II would be 15%
faster than Vega 64 still with 150 watt
TDP so it would compete with an Rx 2070
but it would only cost 250 or TX 2070
r-tx see they're doing the whole thing
where it's confusing a shit again yeah
well I mean this this seems very much
like it goes along with what AMD has
been doing with their win video what aim
no AMD I'm doing with their naming
convention which is to leapfrog the
company they're competing with oh yes
right like X 399 yes when int X 2 X 2 99
shorts and I have RX and they are there
to be fair they were already using rx
but that's very similar to our TX sure
and RT X 30 80 so now if Nvidia really
wants to make an RT X 30 80 it would
have to be almost I'd have to have
almost the identical name which is which
I really hope that's not the case so
just the T is the only differentiating
using and so many part in the name of
many different ways there's also a bunch
of rise in 3000 CPU stuff 6 cores 12
threads rise in threes 8 core 16 thread
rise in 5s and 12 core 24 thread rise in
sevens including 6 core 32 thread rise
in nines previously haven't existed with
again some very attractive pricing if
you know it's true if true but
theoretically this stuff is launching at
CES with a couple of these ap use like
higher-end ap use launching what looks
like a copy text and q3 nice as well as
a rising 9 launching in may perhaps
anyway so all this stuff is discussed in
this tech spot article which is this a
Steve article that's him
wrote this article and they go over some
of their reasons why they think this
information might potentially not be on
the up-and-up
sure including some just some ridiculous
performance gains at the same TDP right
you know you're talking about a 95 or 95
105 watt TDP for an eight-core jumping
up to 12 core increasing the frequency
from four point six to five gigahertz
mm-hmm and still like not increased
linkage it's then you're it's all stuff
in there so sure that's insane that's
our third question to ask you guys are
they true
what do you guys think are these drawer
nuts your person to find out what you
guys feel about it no your answer the
last question first
but yeah before before we get to that or
before we see what you guys think about
this one we will of course go back and
see your responses okie-dokie to answer
to thank you again so for posting links
and chatting so weird a question to go
there it is all right of course I
respect dims
I'll go first this time okay I'm gonna
say I'm gonna say 29% of people are
interested in this 29:29 know I could
just say 30 he could I could but maybe
that's what I wanted used and maybe
that's what you wanted me to say and
also maybe that's a cop-out and I'm not
a cheap ass like you so I will go with
the braver bolder decision and I will
say 31 31 percent no I'll say 38% 38%
just to just to entertain you a bit I'm
scared a little scared all right so I
said 29 cos at 38 my ruse succeeded okay
what do you guys say so he says yes 31
person so my god
I need speed going with my gut I really
need to just trust my gut instinct so
I'm gonna I'm gonna do a like a bad
thing here strategically I'm gonna
explain my strategy here I since there
were three answers it was gonna be split
more right bad some people expect the
interest to be low already good point so
I was trying to beat you into doing
higher than me it was that time I was
gonna be lower
I took a chance like I said it was bold
yeah I mean but if you had done what I
wanted you to do you would have one kid
instead you did something else and lost
that's true I'm gonna play it safe next
time because now I have to take another
drink but I'm gonna be up there if you
go get more beer
I could you could also try my compressor
on up more if you can - those people are
losing their minds and it's it's Mack
sorry I don't think I don't think it can
be that's assuming also that these are
plugged in the right way there's two
channels and Kyle is always on channel
one before and I'm just assuming that
but honestly I should I should go check
that on the receiver the numbers not
showing up you don't see power so
nevermind we're gonna see what the
answer to this question is recent zem to
an avi GP rumors Cal ooh
are they true yes or no maybe I'm gonna
say I'll go first again here cuz it's
and since I tried to deceive you on the
last one you do that I'm gonna say 30 37
% that's very that's a very predictable
but 37% yes
30% of people your was 37% of people
think that it's a yes here do I go high
or low I feel like I'm on The Price is
Right chant that's sometimes trying to
make it challenging for you Oh xxx
compressors too high
oh my god I was even loud like.oh too
high yeah
you said 37 that's the 37 36 cows gone
30 seconds on low I'm going look he's
going low everyone goes what else oh
you're right
you were race but that third answer was
just too good
yeah I knew people were going to go with
that one that's lots of people hedging
their bets thing that makes sense all
right well I had to lose one yep thank
you for the additional beer oh I forgot
to open yours that's okay dude can you
love that you freakin panes and that
wraps it up for asks the audience
heyo and that also wraps it up for my
half of the show double hail which if it
wasn't obvious I was trying to proceed
through with some amount of haste but
you guys good you did guys thank you so
much for watching this half we are still
gonna move on to the after party so if
you're watching live don't worry that's
linked in the video description as well
as hopefully at some points links links
are that hopefully also timestamps yes
timestamps are always much appreciated
thank you for that thanks guys we're
gonna cut things off we'll be right back
