sponsored by Cooler Master and gigabyte
what's up Irwin and welcome to my PAX
Prime 2015 coverage this video is all
about the hardware I know pax prime is
all about like gaming and gaming culture
and all that kind of thing but how can
you play video games if you don't have
hardware to play the video games on
press i'm talking about pc harddrive
we're going to ignore all the console
stuff that's here for the time being and
we're gonna head and said we're going to
look at the pc hardware that's here so
let's do that right now ladies and
gentlemen i'm here at the cooler master
booth and besides being my sponsor for
this events because they're awesome they
also have some fantastic things going on
here so i'm gonna start off with the
master case 5 which you guys probably
have already seen in my excellent video
that i did i hope that video is
excellent i hope you guys like it Rajiv
is going to be my lovely assistant today
although I'm not asking him to speak
because his voice is already going but
I'm basically with the master case it's
moddable it's expandable you can add
things to it and cooler master true to
that word is starting to add additional
things starting with a tempered glass
side panel pretty awesome so basically
you got a lock on the top and it
actually fits in and goes on just in the
same way that their current existing
panel does so it kind of slots into the
side Rajiv could you can you maybe open
that up for us you know what it might be
locked where'd the key go you ran off
with a key look how secure the master
case 5 is all you got to do is lock this
up and then you will have massive
security no one will be able to take
your side panel or the stuff that's
inside your case that is a bonus of this
system it is a very nice piece of
tempered glass though Greg glass still
get a little bit of invisibility inside
of the case very well made you don't
need to do anything to the case all you
need to do is get this piece of tempered
glass pop it in and it fits in with all
the existing mounting points which is
pretty cool so what regime wants to know
from you guys at home is how much this
thing should cost so post in the
comments and let us know how much you
would pay for it i'm sure that's going
to be a very wide variety of suggestions
but they want to bring this out for
people who are getting the master case 5
and they want to know what you guys are
considering my you might pay for an
upgrade of this quality alright so i'm
at lee harrington station because he
left but Lee Arrington is over here
doing like BTW
tube bending as he is very good at oh
here it is look he made this one it's
like a swirly straw you could like drink
your drink out of it or that kind of
thing I'm pretty excited Lee's right
here please say hi to the people hi
people Lisa I'm gonna go from visit Lee
soon I keep telling them that they keep
saying that but he doesn't show up
eventually maybe i will go to pc junkie
mods PC gmail com he's a rookie buds and
you can check out Lee stuff he makes
absolutely fantastic custom builds and
all that kind of stuff all right over
here we have Jerry Jerry is actually
also being he's part of the cooler
master experience right here look at
that that's Jerry and travis is
interviewing Jerry right now for
Travis's youtube channel and Travis is
actually doing some ln2 cooling over
there yes yeah as Jerry is saying right
now but he's yelling really loud so I'm
going to tell you too much much more
calm tone of voice six or seven
gigahertz on a 6700 k is what travis has
gone for here with the liquid nitrogen
ln2 cooling he's got his ln2 pot all
connected up to the processor and he's
going to start pouring this stuff really
soon we're probably not going to be
around to see it but I promise it's very
exciting look at all those pots I wasn't
expecting to see that much pot here in
Seattle but let's move over here to this
custom painting case all right here
which has seattle seahawks logo on it so
i just wanted to show you can't see it
though because he's actually doing more
painting here's the really cool thing i
want to show you not over here with
richard AKA Darth be this Richard does
custom pc builds and everything as well
he's very good friends with Lee they
have kind of a rivalry actually if you
ask them directly they'll each say that
the other person is better but secretly
they believed on god I'm not going to
get rich what the heck are you doing
here and why is that 3d printer so big
yeah so we want to do DIY and kind of
focus so if you're doing DIY you have to
have a 3d printer is it goes on smoking
I need it to so but we want to do
everything large and in charge right so
we brought our 3d printer from the
Vanilla Ice project and so we can do a
36 inches tall by 15 inch diameter so
I'm redoing some crazy things that
probably can't say I'm going to be doing
daft punk helmets and short-term helmets
because I want to get
okay but I'm going to doing some cool
stuff like that like that and one of
those dimensions again okay 36 inches
tall 5 15 inch diameters mind you guys
have anything bad guys I'm stopping by
gigabyte since this is the hardware
video I'm going to start with some
hardware now I want to be a ought to be
direct I'm gonna let you know that a
gigabyte doesn't really have anything
it's like new new here on display at PAX
Prime because they've launched a lot of
really cool new stuff personally of
course all the c-17 or that sort of
thing so i'm not going to show you guys
many details what they have a display in
their hardware walls i'm just going to
show you real quick but i'm going to ask
you a very important impertinent
question that is which of these pieces
of hardware might you want to see us
unbox on our live show awesome hard work
because that's what we've been doing for
our sponsor spots on our hardware oh and
we need something else we've already
done a couple of the g1 gaming morons
who
there's the soc boards this is the x 99
but we hear this may be a c 17 t version
of the soc boards phone us and that
might be kind of cool do you want to see
more x 99 on there do you want to see
more of the c 17 t would you be
interested in the ultra durable series
of mainstream maybe that's sound like a
bricks we we could do something like
that or of course video cards there's so
many of those available and we we have
it done a video Kurtz actually here's
the gtx 980 that just a little fun and
we haven't really touched that there's
these gtx 950 they occupied your site
specifically reiation sli systems the
web and of course all that went for
skirts in canada so we need let me some
comments in the comment section in this
video and let us know guys what products
and gigabyte you might want to see you
might want to see us to do a little bit
more coverage on an awesome party right
over here there in front of the gigabyte
booth this is where they have their main
tournament going on they have a
professional game caster or Jupiter
he's a shout outs for the tournament I
have some general said I'm here you're
all using a purse you know like if I
heard where they're actually running the
heirs of the star haha gtx 950 and 19
although they've repaired it with just a
super Oh be in til 730 series SSD it's
pretty crazy granite slab there also was
not a sir like a professional tournament
these are all just evening you are
participants or people have come to hang
out a bag see what happen to play heirs
of the story a week so they'll jump it
in some of the teams will preform some
of them are people who are grouped
together and this is going on all
weekend here there's some fantastic
prizes including of courses until some
really serious SSDs and their 50 seems
if you have a lot of fun and there's a
long line today
people win device though not based on
their hearing the wind style without the
body before the last I guess I want to
chase aluminum a display here well no
problem let's go back here's one from
exotic pc this one's a bit more question
that's going to college on i-81 gaming
every curse that is a case is it a
corsair graphite 762 gorgeous this one
is actually available if you want it
that is great i'm going to buy the
system right here this guy will build it
for you that's Ivan AKA crazy russian
look he's pimping this validated it's on
the cover of cpu magazine the actual a
couple versions there and system NCIX
ncx us and if you're in the US you can
get that and they have a simpler version
of this bill which is less money but if
you want this one like as is with all
this customized up in there you can
overhear herman CX know before Ellie
Bishop to you you don't even ship it to
you all filled but Ivan would not tell
me how they do that Ivan hat tell us
tell us how you ship things
he's a silent partner today I guess
those are the systems and builds of all
the cool stuff they have to hear the
gigabyte booth I'm pretty happy come to
move up so guess we made our way over
here to the nvidia booth and as they
have been doing at several conventions
that we've gone to recently they're
demonstrating vr capabilities all
powered of course man video hardware
primarily gtx 980 TI s steve is using
the Crescent Bay prototype oculus right
now and he's using it to play eve
valkyrie which is basically an in space
dog fighting game and it's a lot of fun
you can actually look around the cockpit
while you're sitting and playing we're
using it with the xbox controller I was
really missing my mouse and keyboard to
be honest but open the other room though
we just finished a demo which is using
the HTC vive and they were using that in
combination with a demo that was set up
through valve so it had GLaDOS in there
had a lot of the the portal characters
it was both funny entertaining as well
as an excellent demonstration of how the
technology works they put you in a room
and you're looking all around and you
have to do some different things you
have these little hand controllers that
you're doing to manipulate the stuff on
the screen there's a lot of fun and I
think the conclusion that we've all come
to is it first off we need this
technology to get into the hands of
consumers which it should be available
very soon and second off is that I think
all of us needs to start working on
plans for like a VR room in the house so
you can have an area set up where if
you're not going to be sitting like this
you can actually stand up walk around
move around and get all that kind of
stuff done but that's it for here at the
nvidia boost some fantastic
demonstrations and if you guys ever have
the chance to try this out you really
should because it's one of those
brand-new computer gaming experiences
that you can't really get anywhere else
the ladies and gentlemen décor Sarah
moose now of course they're like many of
the other hardware vendors here didn't
really have a whole lot in the way a
brand new hardware to show at least not
if you're following the stuff that they
launched at some of the other gaming
events that have happened in the past
month or two now the cool thing though
is that there is at least a couple
things here that are new to me and i'm
going to show you those things very
quickly i'm going to start with this one
right in here and that is their new
headset who that is this is a void
headset features cool stuff like RGB
lighting that's also available in
several different colors you got yellow
you got white you got black and you can
make the stuff on the side light up and
change colors and that's
its a 50 millimeter neodymium drivers
microfiber wrapped ear pads
noise-cancelling microphone and
universal compatibility with pc xbox one
ps4 and mobile as well as an MSRP of
just 79 99 so check these headphones out
I haven't done an audio quality test or
anything like that on them but I did
want to show you guys that they exist in
there here let's so let's go over this
direction this is the scimitars this is
an RGB mouse that's designed for mmos
and MOBAs so you will notice on the side
panel here there's a big old array of
buttons actually 12 of them in total and
it's got a cool feature they can
actually slide that little array of them
up or down so depending on where your
thumb is you can readjust them to match
where your thumb is that's pretty cool
if you don't mind just one sec I'm going
to take a look at the the most proper
just to give you guys a full look at it
and it's pretty cool got the RGB
lighting system of course dpi switches
there and then just got to push this
little guy up and down and it will slide
and if you want to lock it there's a
little allen key on the bottom and you
can crank that down that'll lock it in
place nice little mouse cimmyt are also
features a 12,000 DPI optical sensor and
MRC MSRP is 80 bucks pretty good mouse
i'm over at msi right now they have a
master's gaming arena going on up there
they play heroes of the storm they also
have another tournament oh area over
there where they're allowing anyone who
just happens to be impacts to jump in
and play but I'm going to talk about
Hardware in this video because this is a
harder video and I'm going to talk about
these new msi laptops new or new
versions that are coming out soon the
first one here is a GS 46 cute new
phantom only then there's this part and
there's that bird so this is the dock
right the doc is separate so if you want
the portability to laptop as well as a
doc this whole panel here you can
actually like pop up and remove and
install a graphics card and you probably
can't see the graphics card I go down
there because it's really dark but there
it is so discrete GPU right there this
doc also has like a hard drive Sox lot
that you can drop in there to flipping
around to the other side you have a
power button pusher you got some
expanded i oh so a great way to take and
go from a mobile laptop over to a more
full-featured gaming systems is a laptop
itself as you can see it's a much
smaller
yes it is for Jenna 1920 x 1080 screen
and it's got a 97 TM in it already so
mobile gaming you're pretty much going
to be all set this is a next generation
intel processor that means is a skylake
basically although we're not going to
exactly which skylake processors in
there so they leave that up to your
imagination a pretty nice little feature
bugs up next up right next to it we have
the key to 70 to 75 so let's take a look
at that one
there's the GT 72's 6qe dominate pro G
now this is one that I've actually seen
before and showed you guys before the
body style is very similar but they've
actually enhanced the keyboard and the
keyboards like effects that they're
doing with the lighting here and
everything to make it a bit more vibrant
but the main thing with this one is that
this is going to be an unlocked skylake
processors in there we don't know the
specific details yeah the respect but I
mentioned that means you're going to be
able to overclock it which I suppose is
something you can do on a laptop also
you have super raid for you can actually
fit up to 4m to SSDs in their use a pci
express its interface and i think you
can train them together and that kind of
thing pretty cool and then as far as the
size as a screen and resolution this is
a 17.3 inch screen and a silver now 1920
x 1080 with the GPU and this one is a
video gtx 980 em and then again we're
expecting to see that's a skylake
unlocked mobile processor in here at
some point too so keep URLs in 2g t-72s
6qe Dominator purchase
I guess I couldn't leave the MSI booze
without showing you their brand new gtx
980 TI this is a lining edition this is
the best graphics card is the 980 TI
series that msi will produce and i'm
very excited about it maybe I'll even do
a video on this maybe let me know in the
comments if you think I should write so
we have OC right because it's
overclocked yeah triple fans into the
dry pros a cooler we also have an
excellent lighting system great lighting
the Lightning system so you can see this
logo here this is not just an RGB LED
but it also ties in with the MSI
software right you should light the mist
is called mystic light so you can see
the demo they have going on here in the
case where it's lighting up in different
colors you can use this be an Android
app to control the lighting change it to
cycle through or anything like that if
you saw my coverage of the x99 got like
motherboard from MSI it's basically
those same features that are available
through that at all right under than
that we have a massively massive cooler
they've added this extra blade under
here because the cooler is very heavy to
support I mean that's a thick piece of
metal that's going on right there that's
it give some more rigidity you might
notice the power delivery up here eight
plus eight plus six a plus a plus six
that's about 150 watts of available
power should be enough for a gtx 980
also the back plate looks beautiful
it actually has the Lightning logo
facing the correct way so be oriented
towards the case window when its
installed in the case or excellent and
beautiful yeah just an overall crazy
over bill card 12 days power delivery on
there the video outs are pretty much the
same as you might expect from a 980 TI 0
for 4 8 millimeter copper heatpipes in
there an acid super copper heat by beret
and they're also talking about doing
another version of this card I nobody
told you this was the highest end but
they might do another one with
integrated liquid cooling now you can
buy this liquid cooled out of the box so
that's still a maybe though so guys if
you want let ms I know if you want to
see a lightning version of the 980 I it
comes with a liquid or three attached to
it is that'd be pretty sweet hey guys
i'm here at EVGA now i have come to look
at their actual bc hardware that they
have out on the table right here where
people can come and touch it and pick it
up and feel it and be one with the
hardware alright so EVGA launched a
series of 170 boards along with the
intel sixth generation core has a
skylake along with skylake watch and i
have not seen any of them so i'm gonna
run down them really quick let's start
where should we start lower high end
let's start in the middle
and this is the most confusing video
coverage area so here's the for the win
what's the MSRP on this one Jacobs about
219 219 for this one so this uh this one
is going to be made for your two-way and
maybe three 2-way SLI maybe do a
crossfire look hard for physics or like
a piece xpress be okay and you got a
four dimm slots you get a very nice all
black VCB running back just like that
and this is pretty this is going to get
all the things done that you need if you
want if you want even sent me and
skylight great no okay now if you want
to step it up a little bit you can go
for this guy right here this is the for
the win no not the for the witness this
is a classified edition you guys have
taken all the red out with a classified
except for that button right there right
that some of the lights are red to the
lights miles you got the dark mode right
yeah so with the VJ boards you can turn
on dark mode and that will turn all of
your lighting off so that you can use
your own lights if the lights that
happen to match or if you're just going
for like a dark and brooding builds
that's an option too but this one apart
there's other features like overclocking
stuff on here surface mounted switches
you got some of that down there but you
got more of it here more and better more
phases for the power delivery I more
power phases
verdi audio okay the biggest thing is
okay for pci express lane that's that's
probably right under there no it's down
here how they moved it down here alright
so plx bridge there and that's why you
can do up to 4-way sli configurations
because it is a multiplexer and it
basically gives you more lanes vs
switching alright this one over here
what is it wait what is this now that's
a next time I i have this board i have
that bored at home this is my main test
bed bored yeah let's let's it is a good
report it's been so incredibly solid for
me that all right let's show you guys
this one actually jacob can you hand
model for me and mine holding it up hold
it up and give guys a good alright so
Jacob was just telling me this is the
best selling EVGA Z 170 motherboard it's
mini-itx for one thing so if you're
building a small powerful system or if
you want to do something for like a
steam box type thing or you just want a
small footprint there's your option you
got to dimm slots so you can still get
yourself some pretty good memory
configurations you got 16 gig dims now
coming out so you can still drop 32 gigs
on to this board if you want it to Z 170
chips out of course you got a single PCI
Express gen3 slot for your card and and
this is I bet it's also popular cheese
riser cards with a sport for some reason
I don't know why your task you need
enough space
apart from that though we got some USB 3
we got USB 3 3
SATA 6g
nice arrangement of io 199 alright guys
so if you're building a small powerful Z
170 system the Z 170 stinger from EVGA
is a great option all right guys asus
has some demonstrations going on with
some of the new motherboards they put
them on these systems and all the
systems are designed by a system
integrators so this one is from ncx pc
so if you saw the built that i showed
you that ivan was pimping over there at
the gigabyte area this one was also
built by that same team so you could
actually buy this whole system if you
really wanted to I mean if you want to
just as is let me open up the side panel
real quick and show you the inside who
look at that it's beautiful smarticle
it's fantastic I'm going to make it out
of here so these guys can actually use
the system to game though next up is
this system from digital storm and I'm
probably not going to get a very close
look at this because it again it is in
use right now but again very nice system
all put together and they've all
featuring the brand new acc 170
motherboards unfortunately they don't
have any of them that are like out on
display that I can just like show you
close ups up so you're not I'm gonna
have to do is get one and like get one
back at the studio maybe do an overview
of it that would be a great idea I'm
going to try to do that here's one from
Butte assistance I like this because
it's tiny and you got lots of storage in
there look at that mess s DS and those
hard drives that's pretty sweet
what do you think megiddo where it's
beautiful it must be quiet it's very
quiet
oh I think we have a system hard lock
that's probably what that is yep systems
locked up okay here just systems it's
probably not your fault it's all the
wear and tear that these devices get on
the show floor here's a bill from
Cybertron PC this is using the AC strict
GTX 980 TI in there you can see it in
their clothing on ominously it's pretty
nice I can't see it through here but
this is a this is an again that n win
904 chassis and it looks pretty I I
apologize i can't i can't really go into
any further details in that but that
this is a popular area and I'm trying
not to take up too much of anyone's time
yeah let's go this way Falcon Northwest
always quality always always classy vaca
Northwest they do a lot of like little
mini mini tiny systems so here's another
mini ITX build I have no idea what
chassis this is or if it's a custom job
or something like that
no side panel window or anything but I'm
sure that the hardware inside is beastly
I don't know what's inside this system
that they don't have a have a little
checklist out here that's saying what's
going on in there let's finish over here
with the origin origin pc there it is
origin has this chassis that they've
been working for quite some time and
again the building there's looking
pretty yeah yeah I really want that's a
maximus eight ranger in there which is
one of the more affordable ASUS ROG
motherboards it's a it's a very nice
board or so I've been told I'm gonna try
get my hands on one and do some more
foot do some more coverage of that and
here's the system i really wanted to
show you i don't know if you guys could
get this at home though because this
system is actually built into the bottom
of the racing simulator
let me let me get this out of the way
what's that the other name that
shouldn't be there okay nice building
there we got a bunch of course their
first ax100 I corsair water cooler
Julius 980 TI strict graphics cards some
pretty nicely sleep the white cable and
going on and I believe that's corsair
dominator memory as well corsair neutron
XD series SSD and all of this is
powering this rig right there so if
you're at PAX Prime and some of the
later days of X Prime and you want to do
some 3d simulation racing you can jump
into the sea right here play some games
okay guys i'm at the HyperX booth and I
think a lot of stuff going on but I want
to talk about their new product which is
a cloud core right here now you guys
probably are familiar with the cloud and
maybe the cloud too because we've talked
about those before and those being
actually good gaming headsets which it
aren't usually words that go together
but the cloud core is hyper X's the
intent here is to basically bring the
cloud at like audio quality to the
market at a much lower price point so
you still get all the same good quality
audio hardware in their 40 3 millimeter
drivers and everything you just don't
get quite as many of the accessories and
the pouch and all that stuff so like
this little guy over there which is the
USB external that comes along with the
cloud to for example does not come with
this you also don't get the pouch in the
other accessories you do get of course
the headset itself which is important
and you do get the microphone right
microphone comes along with it if i'm
not mistaken but you're still going to
get the legendary cloud replicability
good audio quality yeah I'm excited two
people going to be able to access us now
at a lower price point is this available
in different colors ok Clark or is just
on the black and if you want the blingy
colors like the pink over here that's it
then you gotta go to cloud the cloud the
cloud and up in the cloud so you pretty
much here's a pink one this is this is a
cloud to that they just came out with
new color I think Linus might like this
one we should have hyperx some one of
these up to Linus it'd be good idea ok
and that is all for pax prime 2015
coverage here from Seattle Washington
I'm going to be back with one more video
where I actually take a look at some of
the games day up here and maybe just
some silliness because lots of silliness
tends to happen and maybe even some
cosplay it's stuff like that so don't
