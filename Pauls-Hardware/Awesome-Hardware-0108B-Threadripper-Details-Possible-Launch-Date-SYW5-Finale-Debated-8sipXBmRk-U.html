don't even know even care you know how
tired I am right now or how little
entrance I don't care oh because you
 feel asleep in my last week so
that all right that actually relieves
like all pressure on me to like be like
what if I told you that I wasn't really
asleep what if it was all an act then I
will act along with you all right well
then I will write it right you probably
don't believe me I'll do it oh yeah
maybe the whole time I was thinking haha
everyone thinks I'm asleep but I'm
really not that they're all clipping
this and waiting to surprise me with it
on Twitter alright hello everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware this is the
second half of episode 108 we already
did the first half it's on Kyle's
Channel check it out if you didn't
already it's linked in the linked in the
video description we talked about
technology we occasionally curse and
drink and do things of debauchery nature
and that kind of thing so please bear
that in mind and I didn't fall asleep
promise you did don't do fall asleep go
watch less what's outside people last
week we were suffering from jet lag
having just returned from Taiwan this
week
we're still kind of suffering from jet
lag it's it's it's a bit better but
we'll see we'll see how long Cal can
laugh yeah we're also planning to go and
have you laughing we're planning to go
and have some sushi after this half of
the show so we're excited about that and
just wanted to share that with you guys
my half we're going to talk about AMD
thread Ripper and some bit of news on
that also just a quick touch on net
neutrality the games report of course
since e3 is going on we're going to talk
about practically none of the stuff that
it's announced there and then we'll talk
about some scrapyard wars because that
has finally been launched in its
entirety on the lioness tech tips
channel and
and we got got some make some to
say we got some thing it's things just I
got some things to talk about it ain't
okay and you know that's uh real quick
if you guys want to help support us and
our stores and that would chant the
channels that we did because that we
make we make so many channels bit with
bitch wit dot tex slash stores kal store
his shirts and mugs and spike glasses no
yeah mugs pint glasses buy something for
me this time cuz last last half the show
no one bought anything for me and I felt
really sad if you buy from us during the
show we will give you a shout outs and
it'll be awesome you guys love it my
store is pulsar Burnett I also have some
shirts and some decals and a beanie and
indels and a polo shirt and more and
more more glasses it's all very high
quality stuff and if you buy during the
show we say thank you to you at the end
of the show and if you buy from both of
our stores that gets shipped together
and you get a little bit of a shipping
discount that will be refunded to you
after the stuff ships all right dude
let's continue the news section because
we ended Cal's half with news we begin
my half of news how this works it's how
we dovetail
oh maybe people did buy things from me
and I just didn't refresh no usually cuz
I turned off mail forwarding from my
older email address so I'm not getting
those anymore Wow
so I'll be calling them anyone who
bought a shirt or any sort of birthdays
for me on my half of the show today
we'll be getting the call out you'll be
getting a double johnson without even
having to buy anything from paul's
shitty store it's amazing at the end of
this half of the show so stay tuned my
store is like literally the same as your
store it's way different nicer way way
different it's like the savory guy i
guarantee you there's probably like
numerous forum posts on which ones
better call store versus cal store
what's your experience here either one
yeah alright ah is my mouse not working
okay I think my wife is home so
apologies dead phone users because my
dogs might be barking in just a moment
dog alert alright let's talk about
thread Ripper stuff we have an
announcement from Dell about the
Alienware area 51 thread Ripper addition
there's pictures over here look at I
never had a product before called area
51
I have they how could you not have a
crowd like if your if your company was
alien where I feel like that'd be the my
first product that I ever made would be
the area I feel like that's just yeah
that's a perfect name for a product if
that's if that's a company name you're
anyway I'm digressing sir maybe they
have I'm not sure I think it's an
awesome name it's a great unique design
uh-oh
I should have gone nothing like cradled
the camera I did I did were not we're
slowly turning the volume back up bird I
did provide a warning there so hopefully
all is all as well as it does the camera
are we little yeah let's tweaked a
little bit I got it
House Council on set sorry that's this
is just the weight is too far towards
towards me a little bit I think yeah
that should be fine okay
thanks to the Wu matter at hand so this
is going to be among the first ways that
you can buy rise in thread Ripper and in
fact part of this announcement is that
through 2017 Dell will be the exclusive
major OEMs and threader for based
systems now that doesn't mean that
that's the only place that you're going
to be able to buy charger for builds
from put more than that just for a
second look at this one here it's the
same picture of a thread wrist turner
for CPU look at that you big on detail
from that Ren
here I was used using the Arsenal
Kickstarter oh yeah probably how they
took that picture yep computer you see
it as you can see here this chassis that
they've designed which has everything
kind of tilted at a 45-degree angle
alien egg which which looks pretty cool
can support up to three GPUs the base so
there's obviously there's going to be a
bunch of different configurations for
the system that you can get base system
might have anything from the 12 core 24
thread Twitter / CPU all the way up to
the 16 core 32 thread third or per CPU
will be talking in just a minute about
all the various CPU versions AMD is
currently talked about the base GPU
configuration is going to have a gtx
1050 TI or and a Radeon rx 570 but the
max as you can kind of see here assuming
that they eventually plug in these
graphics cards some sit under the power
plugged in yep will go up to a 3-way rx
580 configuration or a two-way gtx 980ti
configuration so that's kind of cool
memory goes up 64 gigs you can get the
base which is a 2666 kit or a 29 33
HyperX memory kits for the higher-end
model up to one terabyte m2 PCIe SSD 2
terabyte hard drive dual killer II 2500
gigabit NICs
and either adele 1828 o 2.11 AC 2x2
Wi-Fi card or a killer 1535 802 that
11ac 2x2 Wi-Fi card gonna be factory
overclocked or at least you can get it
factory overclocked and yeah kind of
like you know the things you would
expect from buying a high ends pre-built
system we're showing what did they get a
look at that this
the the blown-up version yeah I just
noticed that it wasn't on the we looked
at that on the screen we literally flee
right at the beginning okay as right as
the dogs lost their I believe
that's okay hello Milo everyone go
follow her on Twitter mrs. Paul hardware
okay
yeah it's so the drives fit in this rack
on the on the right side the graphics
cards on the left looks like they've got
a 120 millimeter fairly thick radiator
here with a liquid cooling solution the
the blue PCB on the motherboard and the
green dims are just a bonus
yeah yeah that must not be the upgraded
version with diaper X and all that but
anyway all this is to say that AMD
Turner per could launch on July 27th
because that is the information that
came along with this information from
the Dell Alienware area 51 threader
addition is that it's going to be
available on July 27th transit property
yes based on that information the
assumption as we made that July 27th is
probably when this threader per thing
from AMD is going to be available this
article from tech powerup says a bit
more specifically this is when you will
be able to purchase PIB product in box
retail packages of certain models of
thread Ripper also expected a and B will
launch about four SKUs on this on this
date to 12 core options and to 16 core
options okay and then of course all the
motherboards that go along with them
which are going to be suck its tr4 or
sp3 are - that's the socket I mean
that's it's it's LGA 4000 something it's
I forget how many pins ERISA does this
process is a full socket name TR 4 SP 3
are 2 socket BTR for sign in sake are
what's SP 3 or 2 it's a more specific
for yeah I don't know
okay it is the first time I've seen it
I've seen tr4 I like comics yeah I
believe sp I believe sp3 r2 is because
if you look at all of the LGA socket
names they have the pin count which is
what you're more familiar with - v3 x oj
four thousand ninety four is what I'm
seeing a chat I apologize if that's
hopefully that's correct
um be at the the threader per socket has
lots of pins and that is the name of it
is TR four SP three or two might be
another two the number of pin G I mean
some well sometimes they have iterative
code names for sockets as they increase
in size or yes skew or whatever I just
don't know exactly what that is
so I have a general idea just not
specific you know what I'm trying to say
but they will have the MDX 399 chipset
and we did start to see some of these at
Computex which was cool I did want to
point out here though as we've already
mentioned that's that that Alienware
option here Gordon um from does PC Gamer
I'm sorry not PC gamer
let's who does Gordon um work for now um
anyway he's next in a PC world PC world
sorry um he says that it's not just it's
it's it's not just Dell who's going to
have thread Ripper stuff they're the
only major OAM it's going to have three
steps so that blocks out major OEMs like
HP and Lenovo you will still be able to
get boutique om builds from the likes of
origin main gear and other smaller PC
OEMs right yeah okay cool
sweet now for those rising thread Ripper
models that we were just talking about
this is actually a couple weeks old so
we kind of missed talking about this
last week but I wanted to bring up this
list one more time this is a tech power
our tech powerup article and it lists
them all here in paragraph form
which is lame I was searching around for
something that had bullet points and I
didn't find it over here on yourself
over here on this week town whitelist
it'll tweak down the question is is it
worth whitelisting is it worth Anthony I
don't know if you're watching this week
is it worth whitelisting tweak town to
view this list
hey I knew here yes buy a zero bias
little biased go ahead and maybe pause
it for the next five spots let's pause
can you pause it and mute anything click
on my dad and I'll walk you through
blocking it what is that I've never done
that before
where's my whitelist why do we need to
be walked through blocking an ad all
right on this page
okay so you must pay 210 $5.99 in order
to to move forward
Oh God had blocked what the hell I
should I should have just done this
before computers broken
I'm seemingly just permanently whitelist
them just at least on this computer so
Celine if we'd have to encounter so many
issues of tweet-tweet town every time
all right in the add society this crazy
yay-hey no way
ha ha ha come on ha ha ha ad blocker ha
ha ha the hell don't run some changes on
this domain take your filters breathe'
ah God I swear I've done this more times
it's so can you just just look up the
article from a different website though
for some reason none of the websites
just had this listed at a very easily
legible format you know it off the top
your head I have them eyes in the notes
just do that but I can't show people I
want to show people whatever they can
leave they stop ears and I just hit
reload why is it still all right Anthony
as you can see here it could be ad
blockers I'm trying to hit don't run pay
time he was in this domain I don't know
why adblock is popping this additional
site up says whatever the hell it's
saying it's even got select week time
very smart tweak down it tells you what
you choose which ad blocker tell it
which one click don't run on pages on
this domain hit reload I'll look there
it is and then it's thing pops
up again all right that's that's dumb
sorry guys it's a we're not we're not
going to show you that then use a
different source that's what they're
saying a different source what is that
what do you mean do you have a different
ad blocker
here's here's what I can do here is what
I will do right now on the fly for
everyone at home tribe did you try
refreshing the page
I just yes I did I hit refresh I hit
reload I did I did the exact steps that
it told me to do in order to show that
webpage and it didn't work not surprised
so we're just going to go here we're
going to copy the link address we're
going to go over to Firefox where I
don't have a block installed we're going
to scroll down to that list we're going
to use the snipping tool delete folder
system32 try that we're going to snip it
there it is
Hey look at that problem solved snip
snip snip that one in the bud alright so
once again having attempted to to view
tweak town and failing we have taken
measures to extreme measures all right
all that
okay here's the list the nine rise and
threader four CPUs the sixteen core 32
throw an option at the top the reason I
wanted to pull up this list is because
the names are freaking confusing as hell
again and god dammit AMD I'm tired of
this garbage there's already enough
Intel CPUs that I have to learn and the
i9 series and all that crap that AMD
comes out with this alright there's some
theory that all of these numbers line up
with years that are significant in some
way in what in computing history are you
serious but was like The Da Vinci Code
right now that we have to decipher this
bolt I don't I don't know like what does
that have to do with file you're not
even properly sequential like look oh my
the lowest and 110 core 20 thread right
well okay the nice thing about sniffing
tools I can draw on this that's fun I
feel like we made a breakthrough I'm
gonna use the highlighter up here
alright so the 1955 is the lowest end
from there you can jump up to the 1995 X
this is a typo it could be that might be
a typo that's got to be a typo maybe
they meant 1955 this is this was copied
from tweak town this could very much be
a typo alright I hope that's a typo and
it's the 1955 or the 1955 I was I'm even
more confused
then it would go from that to 1956 in
1956 X where you get 12 cores and you
know a little bit higher frequency check
out the TDP s on all these though 125
watts at 155 watts I mean if you can
really get a 12 core 24 thread at 125
watts that's that's pretty damn nice and
that's like lower than what Intel has
been specking out there at like 140
watts and potentially up 265 watts for
their 10-12 core variants we don't have
numbers specifically for the higher end
stuff because those are still just paper
launch items the 14 cores are 1977 and
1977 X and the 16 cores are 1998
1998 X again they seem like years
yeah but party like it's 1999 teen 76 to
1977 to just uh it'd be it'd be one
thing if like all the 12 cores were
1950s again all the 14 cores were 1970s
but that's that's not necessarily case
like there's overlapping and in the
nomenclature is that just makes you all
the more confusing and let me see if I
can check that other arc all right so
the lineup is c2 tech power Arkell like
come on tech power techpowerup you wrote
out all this stuff 16 cord ships are
followed by the 14 lb on time story so
I'll Coraline up no this says it's still
1976 X right right now 1955 the 10 core
10 core ok that's a typo ok now that's a
typo net right so this is this is a typo
this is not 1995 X its 1955 X right
and Anthony fix your stupid I block your
stuff and update your story 1955 X ok
there's your thread Ripper models that
are that are potentially coming out
though going from 10 cores up to 16
cores sounds pretty cool we don't know
very much else about them other than all
that stuff we've already said there's
some rumors right now like the rumor was
that the the highest-end version 16 core
32 thread was going to cost potentially
850 dollars that's very very very rumor
though and I'm not even a pulp the
article on that cuz I guess I could add
you're saying it's right it's right here
alright here's the article on that could
potentially cost $849 you said you were
going to pull the articles I know but is
rolled it up but even the even
techpowerup says let's be honest it
seems like an immensely optimistic value
undercutting even Intel's 10 core 7900 X
which has been announced at $999 and
tray quantities so
probably not that but hopefully you know
a range of AMD CPU options that are
viable for high-end desktop computing
and hopefully more on that soon
cool all right I wanted to talk about
broadband and net neutrality because
I've been trying to bring that up a
little bit to touch on it because I
think it's a major issue right now
and I encourage you guys to do take some
action on it if that resonates with you
now one of the things that they've
talked about with broadband and net
neutrality is the fact that the current
net neutrality rules which is that
internet service providers are
classified as common carriers under
title 2 of the Communications Act
they're saying that that has hurts
Internet service providers somehow it's
caused them to not innovate and not
expand their networks as much and this
article is pointing out that the
internet service provider lobbyists
themselves tends to sort of have two
different messages depending on what
they're talking about
this is an article about the NCTA the
internet and television Association
which is cable industry's top lobbying
group they're pointing out that the u.s.
is now in the top 10 countries for
adoption of internet speeds over 15 and
25 megabits per second as well as in the
top 10 for overall speed in fact the
average peak connection speeds in the US
from 2012 to 2017 as shown in this chart
and also this is from NCT ata
has been increasing pretty steadily the
time period from 2011 to 2014 was was
handled by what is known as soft touch I
believe regulation there was some
standards in place that were loosely
enforced but they were challenged in
court by Internet service providers in
2014 and that's actually then that
actually challenged the rules that were
in place against blocking throttling and
papers
prioritization federal appeals court
wiped those rules out there were no net
neutrality rules from 2014 and through
much of 2015 it was in 2015
that the FCC actually did classify ISPs
as common carriers under title 2 and as
you can see after that the internet
speeds just tanked right they went
downhill they were terrible after that
no that's not true great good they kept
going up in fact they kept going up
pretty significantly so all this is to
say that if you've been hearing that's
title to classification if internet
providers is a bad thing and stifles
innovation according to the internet
lobbyists themselves that is not true
basically what is this has been summed
up as is a power grab by ISPs they see
that the cable the cable television
model that's been sort of ingrained in
the US for so long is dying
that is also quantifiable cable news or
cable cable TV signups have been falling
off big time which is why the major
internet service providers are trying to
have more of a stranglehold and more of
a grip on Internet service because
that's what they see is their next
potential ability to get more money out
of people so if you like being able to
access any website that you want anytime
you want and not have your internet
service providers say oh we'd rather you
not go there so we're going to make that
site slow for you we'd rather you go to
this website that we own so we're going
to make that one nice and fast for you
then you should be against changing
these rules leave it how it is it's
already classified as title to keep that
as it is so strongly encourage you guys
and you can go directly to go FCC
yourself calm which is the website that
was set up by the good folks over it
last week tonight that will directly
take you to the FCC webpage go ahead and
submit a new filing tell the FCC that
you support continued regulation of
Internet service providers as common
carriers under title 2 of the
Communications Act and bear in mind the
FCC might not listen to you
because ultimately they don't have to as
you PI and the people in charge there
right now there's two Republicans one
Democrat and the Democrat seems to be
the one who has been supporting net
neutrality rules the Republicans have
been against it I don't want to make
this a party issue or anything like that
but that's really where it where it
falls out right now and it's going to
suck if they ignore people and don't do
what people want but they might do that
anyway and in which case we'll probably
wait until the next cycle of the people
to be elected to come through but again
I don't to go down too much down that
rabbit hole but just do what you can
right now to let them know how that how
things should be
everyone who understands this issue who
I've talked to pretty much agrees and
understands that the that's the way it
should be and that it's kind of stupid
right now that this is even a problem or
even an issue that's being brought up
but when the guy who's in charge of the
FCC is a former lawyer for Verizon then
he's probably going to do what perhaps
is in Verizon's best interest moreso
than what's in the best interest of all
the people use the Internet
right uh speaking of Verizon Verizon now
officially owned Yahoo and Marissa Mayer
has resigned so she's not there anymore
that's as of today and this was a pretty
big deal that was going through in the
world of big companies who deal with the
Internet's but yeah Yahoo and AOL
because Verizon also bought a while back
in 2015 we're now going to be merged
into a new division under Verizon called
oath it's going to be a bunch of stuff
including a bunch of websites they on
like half post Yahoo Sports TechCrunch
and gadgets as well as apps they own
like Alto and Breck roll as well as
tumblr will all be part of us now
Verizon initially made this offer for
Yahoo back in July four point eight
three billion dollars in cash after
multiple data breaches came to light
over the past year they shaved 350
million dollars off that
purchase price however they are still
going through with the sale or they have
gone through with the sale now
so about 4.5 billion was what the final
sale cost was Verizon's goal if it's not
obvious to you what this acquisition is
to continue to expand their status as an
advertising juggernaut they have ad
technology that they've acquired from
Yahoo they have a suite of highly
trafficked websites that they now own as
well as all the you know just being
Verizon Internet service provider
whether you get well they don't that can
I kind of cut off their fire gets cell
phone service from them they track stuff
to see what people are interested in and
they use that to album ads sell them ads
that's where lots of money has made
these days guys can't talk too much
trash on it if you use lots of Google
services because that's how Google
operates as well but just so you know
that's how these large companies work so
yeah they also have AOL and they're
going to data mined everything and make
more effective ads my parents still use
AOL email yeah they're their data is now
belongs to Verizon didn't even know it's
still existed yep lots of people who
figure out how something works continue
to use that thing until it doesn't work
anymore that includes me all right let's
talk about games yay movies like like
video games video games yes did you guys
we're gonna dive into the games report
because III is going on right now Kyle
have you been very very closely
following e3 and all the know stuff
going on they know I haven't neither by
I am not nice kidding I vaguely don't
have I feel like the things are not I
don't pay much I'm just no substrate
just started updating in the wiki that's
completely not I was unauthorized
that's quick though against my will is
actually really quick updating rape here
a bottle opener
yep open this bottle III is going on
right now so there's lots of video game
announcements and stuffs that has been
happening we're very close to e3 it's
happening in
it's happening in in Los Angeles but I
don't know just not really that
interested in going it's mainly because
of the jetlag yeah
if I was feeling normal I might be like
hey I shall go over to e3 for day or
something like that but it goes through
so apart from e3 the GOG good old games
summer sale is now underway so if you
guys want some good deals on games and
if you like helping support the
diversification of other gaming
platforms besides steam which i think is
a good thing
gog you know it's not a bad one there
summer sale includes a couple free games
or at least games that you get for free
if you make at least a purchase if you
purchase anything I believe you get a
rebel galaxy if you spend only at least
10 bucks now you also get Alan weeks
American Nightmare so a couple semi free
games at least with a base purchase and
there other than that they have over
1500 games on sale up to 90 percent off
that includes The Witcher 3 for 40% off
stardew valley for 33% off her story for
50% off braid for 80% off and torment
tides of numenera for 30% off it's a lot
of things off yeah so go buy video games
yeah babies other than that's here was
an announcement from e3 or at least the
pre III PC gamer event that they had the
original Age of Empires is being
remastered it's going to be called the
definitive edition what do you think of
this Kyle what you probably don't care
if you didn't play the original Age of
Empires I did not I did resent in IMC
gaming that early on this was in 1997
was when the original Age of Empires
launched it is now being remastered you
were nine years old that was nine so
celebrating its 20th 20th anniversary
it's being remastered new soundtrack new
zoom levels which is kind of cool when
you have a game where you have a very
limited scope of what you can see look
look look at the old zoom level okay
does look at that zoom level
that zoom level oh I see Matt you can
zoom that so it's the same game but just
super clutch just different uh I mean
yeah they've changed some of the game
mechanics to allow for stuff that's been
developed that's people have come to
expect when it comes to UI and
interacting with the game stuff that in
97 was unique and innovative that now
you'd be like wait that's that's just
how things should work I don't have good
examples for that but anyway also 4k
graphics which is super important when
you have a game that looks like this
nevertheless though Age of Empires is a
a long time beloved game lots of people
used to like this conservative side by
side of the how it used to look versus
the updated version I don't think the 4k
4k graphics is all that important or
anything like that but you wouldn't have
been able to play this game without
bootlegging it unless you actually had
the old CD ROMs from 1997 and that was a
pretty rare thing so cool just do a lot
of people to play it sort of a one of
the foundational strategy games so
there's that alright destiny - there's a
4k PC
60 frames per second demo that Nvidia
launched it's very gaming yeah destiny 2
is coming soon I thought I had some
notes for this that I don't but where'd
they go
the release date is now in October Wow
yeah I never pasted that in there all of
my notes are gone that's fine but anyway
this is an Nvidia demo that they
launched it's probably being played on
some pretty high-end hardware because it
is 4k and it is pretty like I mean it's
very smooth if you guys the link to this
is in the video's description I'm not
going to play it at that high of
resolution right now but it looks really
cool it also looks like they're playing
it on a controller but will will spare
than that the c2 is going to be
available for PC on October 24th
Activision confirmed that that is about
a month after that
box 1 and PlayStation 4 editions launch
which will be in September 6th the PC
beta
however is scheduled to start and late
August so that's sooner it's only a
couple months away but they haven't set
a firm date for that so if anyone is
interested probably keep an eye on the
destiny to social medias imagining I've
never played destiny yeah me neither
that's ok oh good this is why the games
record is often so lackluster on our
channels like this isn't one of the
three games that we actually play so
it's hard for us to get too into it but
this is one of the new titles it's
actually going to be distributed on
battlenet which is kind of cool
oh the Blizzard lizard thing yeah we
talked about this at the last week or a
couple weeks ago cool but yeah that's
cool Pokemon yeah this this one's for
you Kyle I like Pokemon I brought in a
Pokemon a story here because kind of
like spoke about a proper Pokemon goth
game Pokemon game is coming to the
Nintendo switch do you have a Nintendo
switch no I do not
maybe it's time for me to get one though
this might be what pushes you over the
edge could be because it's not just like
a Pokemon game it's a real pokemon game
what does that mean it means but what a
real it is being developed by Game Freak
who is the same developer who has
developed every title in the main
Pokemon series since pokemon red and Blu
back in 1996 and I know you're familiar
with those yes so there it is so that's
just going to be is it going to be more
in the same vein as the originals just
the same sort of play style and I mean
again RPG again not maybe have details
bear that but it is the upper core RPG
Pokemon games an RPG Pokemon game ok it
says it's unclear whether or not this
will be the long rumored Pokemon stars
which is supposed to be a port of the
existing Pokemon Sun and Moon from 3s or
a completely new entry sounds like a
Pokemon porn parody but it will mark the
first time in the history of the series
that a main pokémon are GRP
title is coming to a whole console that
is true which most people will probably
play it on the handheld version anyway
that but that's cool I guess I have to
get switched now oh c'mon dammit Palin's
switch finally for the games report
whoever watches horizon lunar colony map
is going live next week I bring this up
because I've kind of been feeling the
bug to play overwatch recently this
might be a good a good kicker because
that I haven't played over watching a
couple months I played like like two
matches or something and had a lot of
fun playing overwatch I wish there were
more pictures here but yeah use your map
its lunar colony and that's always
exciting because overwatch they spend a
lot of time with their maps designing
them making sure that they're lots of
replay value and that they're strategic
and all that stuff
you can battle in in Winston's dormitory
yes so this is the lunar colony where
Winston grew up the spaces inside
include Winston's dormitory the
telescope room for the animated short as
well as little areas that clue players
into the reasons that Winston left the
colony and head to earth to head to
earth I guess there's also a to
checkpoint map so I think there's there
might be multiple maps in this
environment but that says it has low
gravity areas so that could be a
different gameplay elements that gets
integrated as well cool but again just
about a week
June 20th until these go live so
overwatch players be happy be happy for
overwatch things sweet all right let's
move on to them their fights third fight
so we're just tired space off this is
not face off alright so for certified
we're going to discuss scrapyard worse 5
so for any of you guys who haven't been
watching this season of scrapyard Wars
it's a it's a show no it's a series of -
tech tips and Cal and I participated in
season 5 the teams were me and Kyle
against Linus and Luke
and just this past weekend's the fourth
episode of season 5 which is the finale
went up on the Linus tech tips YouTube
channel and you know it's it's it's
interesting it's interesting you read
the comments on this video because you
know they're not all I mean a lot of
them are very positive of course a lot
of people definitely enjoyed it but it
seems to be some controversy this
doesn't seem to be like a cut and dry
kind of thing true let's just scroll
down and and all cheating aside I just
want J's two cents to be on the next
rapper yeah that's what's really
important here good J on here talking
about our hard drives that failed that
was definitely a big big big issue their
finale is always the most hyped episode
but it leaves you with an empty feeling
after because you know there won't be
another episode next week I feel the
same way watching like the last episode
of the season of Game of Thrones
yep it's coming back soon though so
obviously there was potential ner do
well er E on both sides there's
accusations of cheating going around
some people with some suggestions about
how the bench benchmarking went done I
like I like that one linus cheats no
problem someone else cheats no go oh but
a lot of people pointing out just just a
fundamental the fundamental point here
that if you take the raw benchmarks of
both systems we that Kyle and I
technically came out on top yeah but
obviously you know we're not we're not
the ones to make the final call on that
so of course this being that was sword
fight this being sword fight we're going
to take a little little debate to this
and let you guys also I'm going to say
we want it in I'm gonna say we won and
why right here
Kyle gets a good luck of being able to
go first on this because I know the way
you think Paul I know you've already
devised a rebuttal in your head as you
usually do you kind of
anticipates that I'm going to take the
easy way out because generally by this
time of the show I'm already petered out
so I'm gonna say we should have won
because at the other day
I'll admit both teams cheated Linus and
Luke had their you know their Michael
guy who was giving him free fans and all
kinds of crazy assed deals and they were
negotiating
you know hardware deals long after the
kid knew exactly who they were I mean he
showed up wearing a Linus tech tips
shirt Linus did in case you guys haven't
seen it that yeah that actually happened
I'm not joking and then they proceeded
to negotiate deals which I feel like
breaks the one of the biggest rules of
the series and granted we had that fubar
moment with the hard drive everything
was in order
we had our together but it was go
time it was like we had three hours left
to do all of our benchmarks and head
over to J so that we could do the finale
and our hard drive that we legitimately
bought just wasn't working mostly mainly
because the guy who bought it from
yanked it out of the the toaster without
without sort of you know stopping it
correctly he just sort of yanked it out
and while the platter was probably still
spinning and that probably killed the
drive and the drive that Linus and Luke
had pawned off to us as sort of a you
know tossing us a bone that didn't help
either and so it was like yeah we
grabbed an external drive and used that
instead we grabbed it from your garage
which technically is cheating but the
alternative there is that we didn't grab
a drive at all we had zero hard drive we
gave up and we were just qualified
without there ever being a sort of
finale like that would have been the
most underwhelming terrible ending to
any scrap yard yet any scrap yard Wars
yet so I felt like in the spirit for the
in the spirit of the show and the series
there needed to be some kind of finale
but it should have been a close fight so
I feel like us us grabbing that that
hard drive was kind of in you know for
that sort of reason I'm not honoring it
saying like we didn't cheat I'm fully
admitting that we did cheat the
difference is is that our cheat
was found out right then and there
whereas Linus and Luke's cheat was found
out long after the video the whole
series had been shot edited and uploaded
to the public I feel like that's the
difference I remember when when that
video first came up you saw it before I
did and you you called me and you text
me like did you see scrapyard Bors did
you see the latest scrapyard war did you
see that scene with Luke and Linus and
that guy and I was like no don't tell me
don't tell me they don't tell me they
cheated and I watched it I was like holy
 that's that's the only difference
that's really the only difference both
teams cheated but we got found out on
the spot while the cameras are rolling
and they got found out long after it was
already published so try to argue with
that bitch you know you know Kyle I
wanna I wanna I so want to agree with
you you know I want to say you're right
I want to say we won but ultimately you
know it comes down to you know we have
to be honest with ourselves we have to
be honest with with the folks at home
and you know we we didn't we didn't live
up to the the rules that were
established by the the rule makers of
the game you know we had an agreement to
go in beforehand and that's the one
thing that I think wasn't made clear I
think perhaps to everyone the actual
specifics that we laid out at the very
beginning for the system and the the
actual storage drive configuration I
don't think that was really specified
and like here's the rules like like they
said to 10% RGB bonus that you could get
they didn't mention that we very
specifically said it has to have a hard
drive and it has to have an SSD and the
operating system has to be on the SSD
those those are the rules so we had to
follow that and that's where obviously
if you watch the show that's where we
didn't like line up we had the SSD we
had the operating system we had the
whole system we didn't have the hard
drive that was in there which needed to
be there in order
for us to have all of the games loaded
quite a few people were like yet the SSD
should have just loaded a game ran the
benchmarks deleted the game loaded the
other game ran the benchmarks we could
have done that it would have taken more
time we're already short on time but
technically according to the way that we
had agreed on everything at the
beginning of the before everything
started that's that's what it should
have done that's I mean that's that's
how it was supposed to go so you know
Kalin I did our best but when it came
down to we just we didn't have that hard
drive in there and that's really the you
know that was the make-or-break thing
and you know you could go he could say
Linus cheated you know you could say
that but you could just easily say -
didn't cheat I just said both of those
things and the second thing I said based
on what I need to argue is what I'm
gonna say is the correct thing see yeah
yeah that we're not you're not good cuz
it dude I never get the dude's name but
the guy at the shop that Linus and Luke
went to they walked in and they were
like he was like he was like hey like if
I can get an autograph first or whatever
like so obviously you recognize him but
what he said after they went through and
spent several hours there picking and
choosing things out of piles of hardware
that they should be able to buy he was
like I would have done the same thing
for anyone else and he said that yeah
and then we should believe him that made
me laugh we should believe him what if
what if it just at one point he was one
of at one point that guy was just like
just sucking Linus's dick like straight
up suck it in and like he's just like I
would lose for anymore Carlin sitting
there like lakitu power supply and
diseases I goes over and it's just I do
this for all my customers
I'm series are like anyone I liked I
just had we got a good vibe movies I
just I predict it's just not a little
special because you're you
you can you get an opera that's just
part of it
I'm just saying you're totally right he
would have done that for anyone who came
into his shop he might up
all right well obvious so we're gonna so
we're gonna we're gonna reveal what you
guys the viewers at home think right
here in just a minute but I think we
should also point out here that's uh
where we're not going to take this line
down yeah
we're going to hack into I think the
wine show on Friday I'm hacking in right
there the hack in Kyle's already working
on getting it back on get that started
oh that leave a mess ain't the same as
you should just
oh you deleted it you should just post
that that's my fiance entered uh no flag
for spam what if I accidentally start
hosting some of them it is easy
none of that none of that I actually
went through the chat what's the book
I'm a bad hacker
I can't even hack up so yeah we're gonna
we're gonna hack into the win show on
Friday we're gonna we're gonna argue
this ourselves here and we're gonna lay
this to rest you know obviously all
right so who really won what are the
results we won we won Kyle obviously we
won that's official I am the least of
the completely unbiased
yep so he personally has set our stream
yeah with with regular viewers of our
show
awesome well I feel vindicated I really
do you know we should do is roll on
there very closer we nearly lost to Jay
yeah Jay Jay was something upon us
somehow crept up there that just somehow
yeah that goes a dickhole
I would I would have think thought the
viewers at home would
with these but they're so selfless Anna
you guys yeah all right so yeah
obviously there's the this isn't the end
of that discussion more more to be
talked about in the future this isn't
over
the yeah it's not okay should be a long
long running feud I think most likely
yep so we're looking at almost eight so
we should sushi yes it is so we're going
to we're going to round out the show by
reading off some of the questions that
were donated so thank you oh we got to
find where my half begins I owed a ninja
fifty dollars I met your stream all the
time because of my schedule this should
make up for it do you have any
recommendations for monitor arms mana
price has some good ones oh yeah
monoprice I've used what's the other one
runs really popular the Ergo tech or go
to freedom arm or yes the one I'm using
for this monitor right here which is a
great a great swing arm for that for a
single monitor just lots of a range of
movement and it's got a nice finish shot
and everything so those are a couple I
would recommend the ones that Wendel
uses are really expensive but they're
super nice but if it's for like a really
heavy-duty net and monitor so and those
are like enterprise like they're made
for so those those might be a little bit
overkill I apologize I don't I don't
remember the name of them right now but
it's a couple options for you Sebastian
Casella for the fifth inch of AR
whatever that is double Jenkins to the
real winners of scrapyard wars thank you
sir those fancy Canadians didn't see it
coming love the show please never stop
we completely agree this bastion and we
thank you for your contribution to
today's show it's an Argentine peso
Argentine peso yes indeed why didn't I
know that
Leon Leon course of $10 you Kyle
love you Paul winky face
nothing well you know if you really want
to hey Leon you know where to find me
that just was nearly the same thing it's
just with you it was more vigorous he's
just playing hard to get thanks again
Hector Martinez Delatour a tech dollar
sir if it didn't create a conflict
interest would you invest in AMD stock
uh I don't he doesn't do the stock mark
I don't lie don't really know how the
stock market
I just never take another time - yeah I
just I'm not into the stock market thing
so I've heard bad things about the stock
market you know like in the past I like
it being no I actually like how the
stock market used to work well now it's
all like computer-based something about
something about 75% of all the
transactions on the stock market being
done by computer algorithms is what
bothers me these days
anyway we could we could really dive
into that but I don't want I don't
really want to as much so yeah yeah I
probably wouldn't just because I don't
do stocks in general so but thank you
Hector for your donation
crafty hack $5 yeah neglect is still
abuse you should after party to make
sure your get your gaming builds
actually work we should just say Wow
shots fired
oh the rising build back there just to
the windows updates oh well it's in good
shape
yes that's that's true we'll have to see
about that crafty again see we'll see
how I'm feeling after after sushi des
Jones $5 should I stick with 1600 X
build that I have a part list for or go
balls to the wall and wait forth Red
River that's a good question does
because thread Ripper is tempting we
still don't know a lot of things like
what's the entry level CPU is going to
cost and what the motherboards are going
to cost I'm going to expect motherboards
to start at probably 200 bucks maybe
even 250 bucks plus that's just kind of
how it goes for high-end desktop
platforms so you're going to spend more
on a motherboard and you don't know what
the minimum price for CPU is going to be
so if you're not feeling like your
motherboard CPU combo you've got say 500
5 600 bucks to spend just on those two
parts I'd say at minimum and that's just
a guess then probably just go with your
1600 X build for right now also for what
most people are doing
we love the massive thread and core
counts for threader print everything but
for what most people are doing it is
quite overkill and you can
by with a lot less so true hopefully
that helps you make your choices
completely agree Jared Jared Allah's
great work what you guys do is case to
see if you have any recommendations for
a tempered glass case that would easily
support the a 240g water cooling kit by
ek um tempered global Wow
so many cases now that have tempered
glass that are better really good
chassis
if you want something relatively
inexpensive and just set up sort of a
good all-around that's 340 tempered
glass
he has a XT it's a great choice for a
case yeah should easily fit a 240
millimeter radiator kit be quiet
pure be 600 is another one if you're on
the more budget end of things the p400
eclipse from fantex is also a good
option
mmm yeah I think there's there's there's
a bunch of good ones out there some good
choices there yeah next time we've got a
pity oats Cote for the 10 Canadian love
your show building an r5 1600 PC and one
overclock decently the CPU do I need the
pricey flair x3 200 megahertz all
featured or others are getting those
speeds for less money 250 Canadian for
16 gigabytes you don't need the flare X
I think it definitely matters like what
kind of die on the actual RAM that you
get some are more compatible than others
but I think the BIOS is matured a lot
more since the launch of Rison so you're
starting to see much more compatibility
offered with a wider range of memory
kits I would do some research and just
search for which which kids have been
known to work and which ones haven't
flare X if you just want that ultimate
peace of mind because it is straight up
validated and certified with Rison but I
know like my G scale sticks my ripped I
was five and my tread and Z kits have
all worked just fine with a variety of
different rising CPUs so yeah okay yeah
so I mean the the corsair 3000 speed kit
that will run at 29 33 and pretty much
all day res and CPUs I have tested you
can get that for a lot cheaper 3200
you're going to pay a little bit more of
a premium for so maybe try to aim for
that
three thousand spot I still get a lot of
the same performance um you know it's
just a couple ticks behind what you
would get there so yeah you definitely
don't need to pay the premium for the
high-end flacks stuff if you're pairing
it with the 1600 lots of other options
out there and hopefully we'll see more
as validation continues and memory
manufacturers come out with more kits
that are specifically tailor-made for a
rezoned yeah so next up we've got Josh
for the $5.00 Paul here's some money
since I didn't get exactly your story
y'all keep up the amazing work you do
keep us in the know and entertained
we'll do our best
thanks Josh marshmallow for 10 bucks I'm
about to build a new workstation gaming
PC and was wondering if I should wait
for thread Ripper or go ahead and get a
rise in seven 1,800 X and get X and X
399 and thread Ripper after it's been up
for a while I think you vent or get X
mana and Federer after again just just
remember you're talking about a complete
platform change going from risin 7 1,800
X up to thread Ripper and what is there
so yeah it really depends on what you're
doing with this with your computer and
if you need all those cores and threads
risin 7 1800 X is perfectly fine right
now for the vast majority of what lots
of people are doing if you're talking
about a gaming PC or even a little bit
more like gaming and streaming or video
editing or that kind of thing and again
remember that thread Ripper motherboards
are probably going to also cost a
premium of a good fifty to a hundred
bucks plus over what you would pet pay
for for an X 370 visits basically we're
sort of parroting what we've always said
about the mainstream versus the high-end
desktop Intel platforms right going from
like LGA 1151 to I'm sorry like Z 270
versus X X 99 this is basically the same
sort of thing like X 99 is going to
appeal to a much smaller group of
enthusiasts who either just want the
best of the best or really need that
extra horsepower when it comes to
productivity workstation applications
video editing etc but for the vast
majority of us just go with the
mainstream because it's going to be just
as good for what you need it for most
likely and it's going to save you quite
a bit of money too so it's the same
thing here with AMD that we've been
saying
you know for for Intel the last few
years indeed
Stevens 1955 thank you very much X he
just said that's because it's 1955 X
like the cpu ah yes the thread refers to
trigger per CPU thanks Steven it's an
awesome awesome oolong I've nothing
automatic Mac thanks for the $5 vation
having it Nate and sorry for being late
you were forgiven you are totally
forgiven cashy's said cash she said five
dollars I have a 1070 1050 Ti in my rig
Oh seed my 1070 how do i OC the slave
GPU 1050 Ti what uh I'm assuming using
the 1050 I for something like physics or
yeah hello see it you did just didn't
any what at whatever yes software in my
experience if you're talking about
afterburner or like precision X you
simply have to select the different GPU
from the drop-down menu
yeah and and then you can adjust the
different parameters for that make sure
you don't have the sync option built-in
there but I can't say that I have
exactly
tried your situation with a secondary
card setup for physics or something like
that so yeah yeah that's an interesting
situation though yeah I would say maybe
try other overclocking software if
whatever you're using isn't isn't
functioning for you afterburner and
precision X or good options for Nvidia
cards
Johnny Fong thank you for your five
dollar donation I was at e3 today an
alienware had a thread Ripper system
with the Vega GPU pre-orders for the
system was July 27th could be on Vega is
released that would make sense
I would actually expect Vega before then
I'm hoping for Vega by the end of this
month but who knows there's been a lot
of sort of back-and-forth with that
but yeah launching the boat at the same
time would make a lot of sense I mean
they kind of double hype with with the
launch and the CPU and a GPU at the same
time that'd be cool but it is nice to
know that they have working systems and
demo systems going on at places like e3
Thank You Johnny
Levi Webb thank you for your $5 donation
$5 a I don't know what the a is
Australians you know it'd be a yeah he
says you guys are always the winners but
Linus cheated honest Luke even looked
guilty look what does the I'm gonna
corner Luke next time we see Luke in
person at a corner Han I'm gonna ask him
straight up cuz Luke coordinated now
Luke won't lie to me about my looks Luke
in the eyes he won't lie no you could
tell how guilty he looked after that
scene with with Michael after they got
all that free yeah all that
you could just tell like Luke just had
this like low self-esteem about him he
just like was hanging his head low just
like we did about there well you could
just tell he was like kind of like
Eeyore yeah you know super kind of
depressed enlightening guilty conscience
Fisher wants to win straight up yeah
Sebastian Casella another really this is
Argentinian pesos or every teen pesos
maybe Argentine peso yes 20 argentine
pesos lightest also cheated when he got
a vga of the vga with the note in it and
said i hope you guys win or whatever
multiple times technically he didn't
though because the rules were
if you arranged if you coordinated the
sale before hands the price and you said
alright we're going to come right now
we're going to buy this for this amount
of dollars and you did that even though
if they recognize you on the spot it was
supposed to be okay you could argue that
in that situation he was cheating
because the guy must have known before
but the guy didn't tell them before and
we're really in a situation where if
someone does that there's only so much
we can do like we try to talk to them
negotiate do whatever we can to set the
price up if they're just holding back in
there like I kind of know but I don't
want to say anything like that's kind of
one of those gray area situations where
we like we've done all we can to do what
what what we would think
you know to abide by the rules in our
situation you know is it possible that
he only made that sale for that amount
of dollars because he actually knew that
it was Linus or yeah do you like I feel
like anyone who's ever watched Linus in
their life will know immediately how
long he calls in taxes on them yeah like
one especially his like sobs his sob
stories like the sob story
stuffy guys friend broke his arm and
we're all trying to pitch in to buy him
a PC we're on a really tight budget he
has some he has a very distinct voice
and he like everyone knew he has a
single psychological some psychological
sales tech maybe the janitor uses which
I've seen him use many times but Thank
You Sebastian all right and again
there's still that's what I feel like if
Mickey Mouse called you hey Paul what's
your favorite oh this is not on his
collar
I was just calling to take a poll to see
what's your favorite Oh Museum hey
you're on there's our partners stop hey
your Mickey Mouse voice freaks me out
uh you'd be like Disneyland probably
wouldn't this I'm probably go through it
that sale could yep you freaked out but
no that's why this is such an enjoyable
season because there's still so much
debate to happen after the fact all
right
Ulysses Lyra thank you for your $5
