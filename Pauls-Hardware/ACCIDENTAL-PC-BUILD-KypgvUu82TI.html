excellent there's always the things that
you want to do and the things that you
have to do I think a big part of being
an adult is figuring out when to do item
a and when to do item B today's video is
definitely going to be a lot more about
item B the things I have to do the
things I want to do include taking like
new hardware that's arrived like this
new max - 99 motherboard from MSI and
just getting it up and running and
running some tests on it and whatever
but it's difficult to do when like my
dining room table which is supposed to
be my overflow zone looks kind of like
this these are all cables that are from
travel and as well as a couple of test
systems that I had set up out here and I
need to clean this up for one thing in
order to make space to do anything else
breaking down this massive pile of empty
boxes would also be pretty helpful I
imagine of course out here in the garage
you can see you know part of the reason
why my overflow area that up there is
overflowing there's no space for
anything if I clear off one space then
it clutters up the other space point
being although I am fortunate enough to
be able to do YouTube videos full time
here at home and work from home and
everything I typically like to have sort
of an ebb and flow as far as the
hardware that comes in and goes out
there should be hardware not just coming
in to my work area here but also going
out and in the past few months there's
been so much stuff coming in that by the
time I finish one project have to move
on to the next and the rest of the stuff
just piles up so for today rather than
focusing on a single little project like
reconfiguring my monitors here for the
new streaming capture system which still
aren't quite exactly how I'd like them
to be or clearing out my old capture
system removing the hardware from that
and decommissioning some of that I have
new plans for that case coming up as
well clearing out any of this stuff here
I have a laptop that we took to copy
text that I still need to pack back up
to return to EVGA and generally speaking
wherever there's mother
words loose hardware lying around I want
to find the boxes for it put the
motherboards in the boxes just get
everything back to where it should be so
that if I say oh I need to do this right
now
I can actually just do that whatever
that happens to be and start working on
it anyway I've done a half intro for
this video I'm going to set up some
time-lapse cameras I hope you guys enjoy
I'm not going to call this a garage work
log but this is also intended to get me
more to the point where I can work on
another garage worklog because that's
another thing that I've been wanting to
do for a while I really like my garage
work logs I like working out here to
make things more efficient and
functional and I especially want to
clean up a lot of the cable management
stuff that's gone on up here and reroute
some of that make it look a little bit
more tied in and professional so I'll be
getting to that stuff very soon there's
a lot of time this summer hopefully to
handle that kind of thing but for now
I'm going to just work and work really
hard and I'll come back at the end and
I'll give you guys a quick rundown of
what I was able to accomplish here
and I think I am all done for today
I say for today but actually what you've
been watching over the past I don't know
how many minutes has been the end of the
day on Friday or the second half the day
on Friday in the first half of the day
on Saturday I've gotten many many things
accomplished not least of which being a
sort of reconfiguration of the streaming
and capture system over here in the
corner actually installed the three
terabyte drives that I got for it so and
I have some additional backup storage on
there and i reconfigured these monitors
so that they're laid out a little bit
better
using my ergo tech freedom arm back
there I switch the 4k monitor or that I
want to get a 2560 by 1440 monitors to
sit back here as well maybe a freesync
one because I don't have anything like
that but I worry about that in the
future for now it's a lot cleaner and
everything's laid out a little bit
better I didn't do much with my main
gear system over here in the corner I'm
considering a giveaway with this little
look worried about that later over here
is my tiny item collection which has
basically been all of the SSDs memory
and CPUs that I've been pulling out of
the various systems and test bed the
test beds that I've had set up that I
tore down in order to reconfigure some
of those those were back here they're
not there anymore
excellent didn't get to this test bed
yet though this is an old x2 99 test bed
need to set this up again maybe some max
- 99 configuration I may be next 399
configuration on it not really sure it
will depends when I get around to that
test beds in general or have been
repositioned back down here and then as
far as this far into the garage I didn't
get too much done over there this table
still piled with stuff again that's
going to be another project to get to at
some point in time but for now though
the main goal was to get that table
cleaned off this table cleaned up of
course the dining room area out there
cleaned up as well and then you probably
also noticed towards the end here that I
actually built a new computer just one
of those things that kind of happens
randomly with me but I have decided to
embark upon a multi-stage project yet
again which I think you guys might be
kind of excited about I'm not going to
tell you too much right now but let's
just say it involves arctic Panthers
that's that's all that's all I'm going
to tell you for now but what I do need
is something to use in place of Arctic
Fantasia that's been my main editing
station back in the
the computer room for a while so this is
my reimagine ation of the silent base
600 the systems I previously was my
capture system back over there the case
is super super quiet the fans that comes
with their super quad as well so I
thought I need something quiet to use
for video editing and Instagram so I
might as well jump up to X 299 so
basically in here apart from the be
quiet case I'm also still using the be
quiet straight power ten 700 watt power
supply solid side panel windows on here
so I'm not concerned at all about how
things look inside but I do have the
cooler master master air pro 4 right
there I've got 32 gigs of Corsair memory
that's installed motherboard is the Asus
x2 99 prime deluxe and then the graphics
card is the Asus GTX 1080i Strix I also
installed a new SSD in there which is a
samsung 960 Evo which I'm going to get
the operating system installed on and
then I do have some more parts to add to
this again once they get onto that
further configuration time and so guys I
am hot and sweaty and I still have your
work to do so I'm going to call it quits
for this video thank you all so much for
watching I know it's been again sort of
a random in-between cleanup type video
but hey I built some systems I took
apart some systems i unboxed some things
i Reeboks some things it was good times
this times up button if you enjoyed the
video we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
