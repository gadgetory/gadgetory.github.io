hardware today I'm taking a closer look
and I'm gonna be running some benchmarks
too on this video card right here this
is the Asus Poseidon Platinum GeForce
GTX 780 so you take an NVIDIA GeForce
GTX 780 you have issues design a custom
PCB for it and they also design a crazy
custom hybrid water cooler that includes
both air cooling and water cooling and I
actually had the chance to sort of set
up a really kind of gimmicky hack
together water cooling loop for this
just to test out the difference between
the air cooling and the water cooling so
I'm gonna give you guys a close-up look
at the card run over all the specs show
you guys sort of my water cooling setups
that I did and then also share some
benchmarks so stay tuned so the retail
box is pretty it's got rog red and black
on it and unlike the video card inside
though it is no good for rendering 3d
games there is a peekaboo window under
the flap and there's info on the hybrid
cooler being awesome and the VRMs being
awesome and the awesome red LED lights
and gee 1/4 threaded fittings which is
actually pretty nice system requirements
are here note the 600 watt recommended
power supply and here is an exploded
view of the card since I do not plan on
exploding it myself today next up are
the specs including the three gigabytes
of vram on a 384 bit interface running
at 1500 and 2 megahertz the GPU as well
which has a one thousand six megahertz
boost clock and will actually get up as
fast as 1058 also a three year warranty
from Asus and the IO listed next
including the introduction of a rule
link DVI which quite frankly I was not
expecting inside the box you've got your
padding the video card a peg double six
pin two eight pin power adapter
ROG case bed for impressing your lady
friends driver disc and manual the card
itself is about 11 inches long and
features a beautiful metal shroud in red
and black plaits jaunty angles ROG and
Poseidon branding and two 90 millimeter
fans on the back is an attractive
brushed metal backplate which they
always seem to do a good job on with the
high-end asus carts then down at the end
you have some voltage Reed points as
well as VG a hot wire connections the
card is of course fully PCI Express gen3
compatible and here's about the closest
look I can give you to the GPU itself
which sports 2,304
food of course to SLI fingers means you
could do up to four-way SLI but NVIDIA
has limited the seven ATS driver support
to 3-way SLI for a reasons I cannot
fathom
so probably 3-way is your best bet here
if you want as many of these cards as
possible
here are the connection points for water
cooling they come capped and can accept
P one-quarter fittings of your choosing
you'll also notice some heat pipes that
help keep that vapor chamber cooled down
particularly when not water cooled and
the long metal piece just below the PCB
which is the edge of that vapor chamber
assembly your eight pin and 6 pin PCI
Express power connectors are down at the
end and praise the maker they put the
catches on top which makes it much
easier to plug in and remove them for IO
you have a couple dual link DVI outs the
bottom one has analog and an HDMI 1.4 as
well as DisplayPort 1.2 moving on here
is a speed through of my hack together
water cooling loop which I'm very proud
of because I threw it together the last
minute using parts from Home Depot I
integrated a random reservoir that I've
had sitting around forever and a cooler
master glacier 240 L which provided me
with a very strong pump and a 240
millimeter copper finned radiator and
looked very funny hanging off the in
windy frame that is our primary test
Bend with the water cooling loop in
place I was able to overclock the GPU to
one thousand one hundred and sixty
megahertz boost block which actually
topped out at one thousand two hundred
and forty one megahertz while
benchmarking speaking of benchmarking
let's take a look at some here's the
Asus GTX 780 Poseidon Platinum running
at the out-of-the-box speeds on air
overclocked on water and for comparison
I have a reference GTX 780 and from my
recent 4k video there's the overclocked
GTX 780 Ti and the overclocked and
water-cooled AMD Radeon r9 290x enjoy
so there you have it guys the asus
poseidon platinum gtx 780 a fantastic
car definitely one of the coolest cards
i've played with in quite some time when
it comes to who this card might be
designed for or who would really get the
best use out of this card I really see
it being somebody who is building a
system right now looking towards the
higher end since we're talking about a
GTX 780 and wants to invest in an air
cooling solution right now but
potentially upgrade to water cooling say
the next three to six months because
really if you're looking longer than
that then you're probably looking at a
next generation of cards coming out you
look if you're looking shorter than that
we'll just do water clean loop right now
but the water block on this card the
whole water cooling loop setup excellent
performance overall so I can't say I
have a whole lot to compare it to
because I haven't done a ton of water
cooling of graphics cards myself but at
20 degrees C plus difference going from
the air point to the water cooling is a
pretty huge difference and that's also
taking into account that the air cooler
was already performing a good 10 to 15
degrees C below what the stock air
cooler for the seven-day he does so
pretty cool all around but so I'll post
a link to the video card here I new make
that common in the video's description
if you guys want to check it out while
you're down there don't forget to the
like button maybe leave me a comment on
how much you liked this video or how
crazy or how where do you think this
card actually is and whether you might
actually buy one because I'm interested
are you guys interested in a card like
this or so just one of those sort of
elitist top-of-the-line cards that you
maybe read about or watch a video about
but never really actually that
interested in buying let me know in the
comments below thanks for watching and
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
