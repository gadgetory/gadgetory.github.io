here I have another gtx 980ti
this one is the reference version from
Nvidia and this one from EVGA is custom
in today's video I'll be showing you
three things first off what is the
difference between custom and reference
second I list some pros and cons for
each design and third depending on the
type of computer that you're building
what is the best choice between custom
and reference see like I said three
things I also want to point out that
whereas I'm using these nine ADT eyes as
an example for this video this video
really applies to all GPUs that have a
reference design as well as custom
versions so whenever a GPU manufacturer
like Nvidia or AMD makes a new GPU they
almost always design a reference
completed graphics card as well like
this one originally this was to provide
an easier means for AIB or a IC partners
that's add-in board or add-in card for
those who don't have all the acronyms in
the world memorized to actually get the
graphics cards onto store shelves with a
minimal amount of R&amp;amp;D investment in
recent years though these reference
designs have scaled up in performance
and looks to become more like statement
pieces from AMD or Nvidia so for example
nvidia has been so pleased with the
design of this reference cooler that
they originally launched with the OG
titan in february 2013 that they've used
essentially the same design for all of
their high-end single GPU graphics cards
ever since sometimes they may make parts
of it more or less black depending on
how badass the GPU inside is of course
AMD for their part didn't hit with as
much reference cooler design success
when their Hawaii GPU based cards
launched but they have made some
extremely compelling reference designs
with built in water cooling such as the
very successful dual Hawaii r9 295x2 as
well as the upcoming fury x card but I
already mentioned add in board partners
and if you haven't noticed this before
you can buy graphics cards from an AI V
partner like EVGA msi gigabyte ASIS or
XFX but you'll have a hard time actually
buying a graphics card just from AMD or
just from Nvidia
for that matter AMD and NVIDIA design
and manufacture the GPUs at the heart of
the card they create a reference design
that they also might manufacture or
allow ad n board partners to manufacture
and the AIB partners handle things like
packaging distribution customer support
and returns so if the reference designs
were perfect
we'd never need any custom designs right
well that may be true but as Morgan
Freeman once said in the classic film at
Robin Hood Prince of Thieves
Allah loves wondrous variety a Ivey
partners with the means have taken to
designing their own versions of cards in
order to improve cooling performance
overclocking or simply to help their
cards stand out in a marketplace flooded
with look-alike reference cards adding
your own special sticker to the
reference design doesn't always do the
trick so custom cards come in a few
varieties the AIB partner can choose to
use invidious design for the PCB the
printed circuit board that the GPU
soldered to think of it like the PCB is
to the GPU as a motherboard is to a CPU
in this case the layout of all the
components on the PCB will be the same
the GPU location the power delivery the
traces but the cooler that sits on top
can be radically different that's the
case with this GPU from EVGA which uses
EVGA specially made cooler on top and
the Nvidia reference PCB design on the
bottom they put a backplate so you can't
really see it key BGA's recent custom
cooler designs are called a CX or active
cooling extreme and other manufacturers
have also come up with fancy names for
theirs as well gigabyte has the wind
force Asus has direct Cu MSI has twin
frozer for example but they're all
custom coolers if you want to simplify
things and their performance may vary a
lot depending on lots of factors and
deciding which custom cooler is the best
is not really the point of this video so
we'll leave it at that one thing to
point out though is that almost all the
popular designs for custom coolers right
now are open with multiple fans like the
ACX cooler here two and sometimes three
whereas the reference designs for both
nvidia and and
are closed housings with a single blower
style fan that's meant to push air out
the back of the case so when I talk in a
moment about choosing which one you
might want for your system
I'll be comparing the characteristics of
open multi fan cooler designs versus
closed blower fan cooler designs even
though it's not out of the question for
a reference cooler to be open or for a
custom cooler to be closed now custom
open multi fan coolers like EDG ace here
will also have cooling elements
positioned on top of the heat generating
parts of the card like the GPU memory
and voltage regulators and very often
like the ACX cooler will use heat pipes
or other efficient conducting parts to
pull heat away from the GPU memory etc
and out into these arrays of metal fins
which are usually made of aluminum the
fans on top of the fins push air over
them to evacuate the heat from the area
but since the design is open the air
will not be pushed at the back of the
case well some of it will but most of it
won't and will instead go out in all
directions to co-mingle with the rest of
the air in your system the second part
of a custom design can be the PCB itself
this is usually reserved for the most
specialist high-end cards aiv partners
with engineering teams at their disposal
can redesign the board itself retracing
the traces moving components around to
suit their needs and changing the power
delivery elements to maximize
overclocking potential or even to add
video memory LED lights or other
distinguishing features
so our custom-designed PCBs better than
reference designs I can't really say yes
or no across the board but I think that
a manufacturer like EVGA or asus
wouldn't go to all the trouble and
investment of designing their own custom
TCB unless they saw some tangible
benefit from doing so speaking of
tangible benefits it's time to talk pros
and cons for reference versus custom
graphics card designs and we'll start
with the coolers remember I'm not just
comparing reference cooler versus custom
with the cooler here but also closed
blower design versus open multi fan
design since that has been the market
trend for quite some time on the plus
side a reference closed blower style
cooler will keep the other components in
your
some cooler by pushing the hot air out
the back of the case often to the tune
of five to ten degrees Celsius for a
component like the CPU for example but
this will obviously vary a lot depending
on your hardware on the minus side cards
that use these designs usually run at
significantly higher temperatures in my
experience sometimes 10 to 20 degrees
hotter than a comparable open cooler
video will tell you that their GPUs are
designed to run at 80 degrees Celsius or
more but keeping things cooler can mean
better performance longer lifespan and
higher GPU boost frequencies the
flipside for custom open design coolers
is that the GPU can run much cooler but
at the expense of warming up the rest of
the parts in your system in either case
as parts get warm fans will ramp up
their speed to help dissipate the heat
so it's hard to say that one solution or
the other will provide a better
experience if you're looking for a
silent gaming system either the GPU fan
might get loud or your case or your CPU
fans might get left for the PCB itself
the benefit of a reference design is
usually compatibility reference PCBs
will get the job done and they have a
wider range of compatible aftermarket
coolers so if you want to mod your card
in the future with something like an
NZXT krey-kin g10 or Corsair hydro HD 10
for water cooling or a full custom water
cooling loop with a block for your GPU
you'll have a lot more options with a
reference PCB design custom PCB designs
often have the benefit of added power
delivery and can generally outperform
reference design boards all else being
equal of course these cards are usually
designed for overclocking and since they
are often high-end models it's very
common for the GPUs and custom design
boards to be binned or tested for
performance with the best performing
GPUs selected for custom-designed
graphics cards if you don't want just a
980ti you want a 980ti that can
overclock like mad and beat out your
friends 980ti a full custom design is
the way to go even though you'll find
less compatibility with aftermarket
cooling solutions these highest end
models usually do get support from
companies like EK with specially
designed water blocks since they're
usually the best performing cards on the
market the other trade-off if it wasn't
already obvious is cost as top-end
custom cards can command a hefty premium
even
their reference design counterparts that
use the same exact GPU so the last thing
to talk about is what is the best choice
for you and my question would be what
kind of system are you building in my
opinion there are situations where the
reference blower style design works
really well if you're installing
multiple graphics cards with SLI or
crossfire but you have limited airflow
for example it's much better to have the
hot air escape out of the case rather
than warming up everything else inside
especially if you have multiple cards
and a smaller form factor system as well
when space and air flow are very limited
a blower style card will do a great job
particularly if the case positions the
card right next to a side intake so it
can have its own little airflow system
without affecting the rest of the
components now there's no denying the
efficacy or popularity of custom designs
and I generally recommend them over
reference designs if you have the proper
airflow high airflow cases are all over
the place these days so if your case has
larger front intake fans unobstructed
paths for air to get back to the GPU
area good exhaust then you'll be able to
mitigate the extra heat that the
graphics card can add to the system the
trade-off can be noise though so invest
in some higher quality case fans and CPU
cooling to help keep things quiet I
don't know what you guys are using at
home though how many of you have an
Nvidia referenced design GPU from the
past few years it looks exactly like
this one except for the letters on the
end and how many of you have a two or
three fan GPU cooler running from any of
the other corners of the market where
those exist let me know in the comments
and I will read them and smile speaking
