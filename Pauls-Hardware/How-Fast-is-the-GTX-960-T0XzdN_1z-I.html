invidious new sweet spot GPU and it's
gonna cost you about $200 I'm gonna do
the short version of this review right
up front this card performs very well at
its price point it uses significantly
less power than the last generation gtx
760 and it's a recommended by for pc
gaming at 1080p not last part about
1080p is very important but more on that
later let's start the closer look at as
o tex geforce gtx 960 this is the amp
Edition which means it's over Clark from
the manufacturer $210 MSRP and it has
what ZOTAC is calling exo-armor that's
the back plate on the back as well as
the dark gray metal shroud it's got a
wraparound backplate and then the cooler
is what ZOTAC is calling a storm it has
two fans on the front it also has two
copper heat pipes at the middle they're
very long though they go all the way
across the base of the card then come
back around and go all the way back
across the top it's also got freeze
technology so tech has lots of fun names
for their stuff this year that means the
fans don't spin up until the GPU reaches
a certain temperature that's all the
rage these days as such this card seems
geared a little bit more towards silent
operation its idles at about 40 degrees
Celsius that's passively cooled of
course with the fans not spinning and
then since the fans stay at low rpms the
temperatures do get up to the high 70s
and low 80s under full load but that
didn't result in throttling and remember
Nvidia designed these GPUs to run at 80
degrees Celsius the upshot is that this
card is very quiet it's only eight point
two or 208 millimeters long and thanks
to GPU boost the core clock out of the
box is gonna wrap as high as one
thousand four hundred and thirty
megahertz I like the design of this card
it's actually got a nice dark gray
finish it's got some subtle kind of
carbon-fiber ish accents a black PCB and
then so tech gets extra bonus points for
including that wraparound backplate just
a single six pin Peggy connector is all
that's needed since this card only draws
about 120 watts max the zotac suspects
say they recommend a 500 watt power
supply for your whole system but
Nvidia's reference card only says you
need 400 watt power supply which I think
he can get away with with this one
because my max power draw under testing
was less than 300 watts and that's with
an overclocked
59 60 X the video outs on the back are
the same as the 970 in the 980 what
three DisplayPort 1.2 s1 HDMI 2.0 and a
dual link DVI and you can power four
displays from the single cart future
sport is also pretty much the same as
the 970 and 980 including the new
dynamic super resolution g-sync and
shield support GPU boost physics etc all
that good stuff but now on to the gtx
960 core specs it's a brand new GPU it's
called the GM 206 still Maxwell
architecture but that's as opposed to
the GM 204 that's used in the 1970 and
980 when I first saw the specs of the
960 I was actually a little bit confused
I was surprised to see the memory
configuration at least and over the past
couple days I've had this internal
argument with myself kind of coming at
the gtx 960 from three different
perspectives pc perspectives anyway the
first perspective is actually invidious
they made the 960 after all they know a
thing or two about it I think in videos
goal here is to jam as much performance
as they can into a 200-dollar video card
without cannibalizing the sales of their
other cards like the GTX 970 so you have
1,024 cuda cores and they've juiced the
GPU base clock to 11:26 and the boost to
1178 but most cards like ZOTAC see our
shipping overclocked to even higher than
that but they also did some things to
slow down the cards performance and it's
pretty clear to me at least that this
was to keep the card from over
performing at higher resolutions there's
32 ROP units which is half of what the
970 has for example and only 2 gigabytes
of memory on a 128 bit bus the GTX 760
also had 2 gigabytes of memory by
default but it was on a 256 bit bus
which just kind of feels like a step
backwards ok if you can't already tell
the second perspective from the three I
mentioned earlier is my own and I am
horribly spoiled by access to high-end
PC hardware and 4k monitors and all that
kind of thing so when I start to agitate
over these design choices I have to
remind myself to calm down that this is
really just a $200 card
whereas the gtx 660 and 760 for example
were more in the 250 dollar range at
launch I also think that I was so happy
with the bang for your buck that was the
GTX 970 release that I guess I kind of
thought it would just always be that way
anyway the third perspective since
you're probably wondering is that's of a
pretty standard
PC gamer who might not have a lot of
money to spend and who is perfectly
happy with their 1080p monitor for the
foreseeable future
ultimately I could only resolve this
with benchmarks so that's next
so something used to point out as we
look at hardware specs yes my testbed is
super awesome and thanks to Intel and
EVGA and g.skill for the CPU mobo and
memory also I wanted to throw in a GTX
760 for comparison and the only one I
have is EVGA is 4 gigabyte for the win
version so bear in mind how having more
memory helps its performance especially
at high resolutions also I do have an
hour 9 to ATX I was going to do
comparisons from team red but it failed
spectacularly on me right at go time so
my apology my apologies for the lack of
AMD representation at least in this
video we'll do the comparison video in
the future 3d mark this is the only test
I ran at 4k and here is the best example
of why the 960 is a 1080 card grade of
1080 miserable and ultra as the GTX 960
is doing its job in my opinion it should
perform about 30 percent lower than the
GTX 970 on to Bioshock Infinite's
the GTX 960 s marginal performance boost
over the 760 didn't impress me much here
I ran most tests with 4x anti-aliasing
and AAA is something you want a lot of
memory bandwidth for still it's setting
about where it should compare to the 970
Metro last light this one is always a
killer but I thought the 960 did a good
job keeping the minimum frame rate from
dipping too low and even hitting well
over 30 FPS average at 2560 by 1440 for
Crysis 3 the GTX 760 wins here even at
1080 and I think that can be attributed
to anti aliasing and the heavy load that
CryEngine puts on the GPU also reminder
once again that the GTX 760 has 4
gigabytes whereas the 960 has only 2
and lastly battlefield 4 I actually
think the thing that impressed me most
was that you can finally get a card that
holds above 60 FPS average playing
Battlefield 4 on 1080 ultra settings for
$200 so now that we've seen some numbers
how things look for the gtx 960 well
from an videos perspective i think they
did their job the card costs less than
the gtx 760 in just a week or two ago it
holds its own
gameplay and it even won't threaten
their upper tier offerings that are
designed for higher resolutions for
about two-thirds of the price of a GTX
970 you get about two-thirds of the
performance from a my perspective I
would have liked to see just just a
little bit more from the GTX 960 and the
past this tier of cart has seemed kinda
like a gateway drug teasing you with the
performance that nips at the heels of
$400 cards in some situations I think
when Nvidia is actually doing and to be
clear I am just speculating here I know
nothing is leaving a space open for the
gtx 960 TI with maybe more memory
bandwidth more ro peas more cuda cores
also a 4 gigabyte version of the 960
will probably happen at some point if
history is any indicator ultimately
though i think it's the 1080p gamers
perspective that is most important and i
know there are a lot of you out there
for you guys I think this card will do
everything you want it to and I think
you'll be happy with it
I think this card could even hang with a
1440p monitor but you're probably gonna
have to turn down some settings maybe
reduce the anti-aliasing and that sort
of thing to get a good framerate but let
me know if you agree with me in the
comments though don't forget to like
this video and subscribe to my channel
if you haven't already thank you guys so
much for watching this video and we'll
see you next time
ultimately though I think it's the 1080p
gamers perspective that is most
important and I know there are a lot of
you up very durable durable guys okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
