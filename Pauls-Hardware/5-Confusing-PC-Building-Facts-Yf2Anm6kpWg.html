make out like building a PC is easy it
is for the most part but sometimes
instead of being easy it is hard that
usually means that you've encountered
one of the following PC building
paradoxes but hopefully this video will
put some of your fears to rest screw
struggles if you've ever had to bust out
the pliers to separate a screw from a
motherboard standoff then you've already
learned this hard lesson about our
phillips headed friends you see the fact
is that the pc building gods and their
infinite wisdom chose to use two
separate standards from opposite ends of
the globe when choosing which types of
screws should commonly hold our
computers together there is UTS 6-30 to
and then there is m3 based on the metric
system i usually call UTS 632 the coarse
thread screw it's used for power
supplies 3.5 inch drives PCIe expansion
slots to hold on your cases side panels
and most of the time for motherboard
standoffs m3 I like to call fine thread
it's usually used for smaller 2.5 inch
drives whether they're hard drives or
SSDs for securing optical drives and
sometimes from other board standoffs as
well which is why it's always a good
idea to check what types of standoffs
and screws your case is using before
installing your motherboard is it a UEFI
or a BIOS the BIOS or basic input/output
system is what your PC churns through as
it boots up and it has long been a place
of fear and uncertainty for new PC
builders now we must also deal with the
fact that newer motherboards don't have
a BIOS anymore it's become the UEFI for
a new motherboard since about 2014 which
stands for unified extensible firmware
interface which really just rolls off
the tongue and is not confusing at all
at least when I tell people what bio
stands for it would kind of click a
little bit and they'd be like oh yeah
that kind of makes sense to be fair the
BIOS has been around since about 1975
and the new UEFI standard was needed to
allow booting from larger hard drives
for low level operating system tie-ins
that allow UEFI based computers with
Windows 8 and Windows 10 and SSD to boot
in like 15 seconds or less just remember
that for you it still works functionally
the same as a BIOS you can still access
the UEFI by tapping delete during
startup
can still revert to default settings
using your motherboards clear CMOS
function if you happen to screw anything
up and we've even been getting away with
calling it the UEFI BIOS even though
that's not technically correct busting
static myths I've given my fair share of
warnings about electrostatic discharge
or sapping something to use the
scientific term but the fact is that I
have never in my life actually damaged a
piece of computer hardware with a quick
shock from ESD that's not to say that
you should ignore an ESD completely but
using practical methods to neutralize
your static buildup like touching your
power supplies housing every so often
while that's plugged in and grounded is
almost always enough to prevent any
issues also make sure that you're
working on a non conductive surface like
wood so no metal table tops and if you
live somewhere that's very dry you
should take extra care as less humidity
means ESD will be more common CPU socket
lever pressure and you CPU installation
can be a nail biting experience even if
you built a system before build guides
like mine are always careful to point
out just how delicate you should be
during the step but for the newer Intel
LGA sockets the fact is that after you
ever so daintily place the CPU in the
socket with the notches and the triangle
lined up you'll often have to wrench
down on that locking lever with some
significant force you might even hear
some creaking and groaning from down
there but like an elderly couple making
sweet sweet love the cringe inducing
sounds will quickly subside once the
payload is deployed I should mention
that if you're using a newer Intel
skylake processor you should be a little
bit more careful with this since their
PCBs are thinner and also apologies to
any of my regular viewers who can now
never install CPU again without making
that elderly couple Association what
about this SSD is 2.5 inches don't you
hate it when your computer parts are
deceptive take a look at this 2.5 inch
SSD for example I think most of you
would agree that this is a 2.5 inch
drive it you know what let's check
ah so that's ah this is actually more
like 2 and 3/4 inches wide maybe they're
referring to something else
all right so I have discovered that no
part of this drive actually measures 2.5
inches you're some fish large okay so be
honest this fact probably hasn't caused
problems for you guys directly unless
you've blindly attempted to
scratch-build your own case but there it
is
neither 2.5 inch drives nor 3.5 inch
drives not even the five and a quarter
inch drives that we hear about from
legends of PC buildings pasts are
actually the size that they say they are
the measurements comes from spinning
mechanical hard disk drives whose
internal spinning platters do measure up
properly 3.5 inches or 2.5 inches
whatever the case may be the only
defense that I can think of for their
deception is I don't know maybe it's
just really cold outside and that is all
five confusing PC building facts I had
fun making this video I hope you guys
enjoyed watching it if you did don't
forget to hit that like button down
below I could totally do some more
videos in this series so let me know if
you have any ideas in the comments
section also you can use my amazon link
which is down in the description click
on that before you shop for stuff at
Amazon and that helps me immensely feel
free to visit my store at store dot
paul's hardware net where you can
support me by picking up shirts or mugs
or pint glasses and lastly consider
subscribing to my channel if you're not
already for the latest to tech videos
and as always thank you for watching
