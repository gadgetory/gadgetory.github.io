sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill alright guys I've made my way
over to Galax and I'm rolling solo today
I don't have a camera person so I'm just
going to be behind the camera the galaxy
first makes graphics cards and some
other things too that I'll show you in
just a second but in my efforts to bring
you every single variety of GT X 1080
and 1070 that I can find at Computex
let's take a look at some of what Galax
has to offer so here's the proverbial
wall of graphics cards and the ones up
at the top of the ones here in wrested
those are in the GTX 1078 since Kennedy
range so starting I will start on the
far left that's the reference PCB
designs at the top is a gtx 980
reference or let's get a reference pc me
thanks got some of the blower style
clear on that a little bit of blue
accents pretty clean looking overall
hello that we have a gtx 1070 version
again so use the reference PCB so i'm
imagining these are going to be
reasonably priced although granted this
is more for our global audience as Galax
doesn't really sell in the US currently
for the right of that though we have a
couple more more special versions we
have the EXC
version 2 the gtx 970 and 1018 these
have kind of black shrouds they've
actually done a bit of extra work with
pulley on them especially the size of
the PCB the sides of the shroud and of
course the fans we got a double fan
solution to the exo CF top of the gtx
980 triple fan solution going on there
for the 1070 file here they've also
integrated some RGB LEDs they actually
that it is sort of interesting Ledo on
the back plates which does have a
backlit looks pretty nice have a piece
of acrylic that they've integrated their
LEDs kind of shine through it and get a
bit of rim lighting right around that
edge that's pretty nice looking actually
I don't know I don't like those peg
connectors I know those are ugly but the
card itself is weak it also has RGB LEDs
on the pins so
RGB LED other things that is definitely
a theme of complex this year's to the
right of that we have the Big Daddies
the galaxy geforce gtx 1080 hall of fame
we have the white version of top well
they're both white versions they have
white PCBs and up top is a first attend
a monster card it's very long it's very
large has to eight pin power connectors
it does have a back plate on the back
but this one's like literally just
attached to the wall so there wasn't
much I could do to get a look at that
perhaps we will get some additional
footage of it at a later date below that
we have the gtx 1070 Hall of Fame this
one doesn't have a cooler on it but I'm
told they're going to be using the same
cooler here you can see the very very
nice clean white PCB though that is what
galaxy's fairly well known for they
started this whole thing I think with
the white PCBs at least on the graphics
cards super clean as you can see it's
got 12 face power delivery to 8bim power
connectors and it's just a pity visa
design overall and it's in a white bill
that feel like you should really go with
the Gallic scarred but hey if you're
doing white milled you might want some
of this stuff down here too okay check
this out galux actually has a bunch of
additional white PCV components they
have on display here including SATA SSD
with some LEDs they of course have their
high bandwidth SLI bridges also
available with Galax trim so you know
those are going to light up and
everything ddr4 memory ddr4 4000 memory
actually is well pretty fast speaking of
working in gigan eight gig dims there
again with white PCBs and Galax all fame
branding on them we have a PCIe SSD here
as well which looks pretty clean and
then we have little white piece m2
drowse I actually thought those are
really sexy when I first um I've got two
drives especially green PCB ones they
just they just kind of suck so
nice to see some white versions here
previously
very nice speeds on them too looks like
they got read speeds up to 2500 write
speeds up to 1200 I believe they are
nvme and it's really nice now they also
have the variants that you connect to
YouTube so you get the PCIe n but to
2280 version DLC guys you got to
compatibility so if you want a little
bit our storage and go with that
and this one also has pretty fast read
and write speeds pretty much the same as
the other one twenty five hundred and
twelve hundred respectively but that is
going to wrap it for the galaxy booth
guys hope you've enjoyed it
trust me I'm here I'm behind the camera
if you enjoyed this video that'll maybe
give my sponsors a bit of love the
sponsor links it down the description
and a big THANK YOU to them correct will
design MSI and G skill for sending me
out to compute X I'll be back soon with
more videos
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
