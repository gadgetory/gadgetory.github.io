hardware I am back and I am doing a
quick video here I've moved into my new
house and I'm still very very far from
being unpacked and having everything set
up though but nevertheless I don't want
to bring you guys a video and I do have
a pretty nice product to share so this
is the Maximus 6 impact motherboard if
you guys haven't heard heard of it it's
Asus
ever rog mini ITX motherboard so the
small smallest mainstream form factor
for a full fledged desktop computer and
the impacts has been on the radar for
quite some time it's available now and
this is not going to be a full overview
I'm really just going to give a really
quick unboxing talk about some of the
parts of this motherboard that I really
thought were compelling or some some
innovative things that Asus did if you
guys want a full rundown of everything
on this board check out the new egg TV
youtube channel because I did an
interview with JJ from Asus and he gave
just about all the gritty details you
might want about this motherboard but
that being said this is the Maximus 6
impact it's a socket 1150 motherboards
so it has a z87 chipset right there and
it's designed for Intel's fourth
generation Core processors aka Haswell
and here's the box so the m6 impact what
they've done here is they've tried to
give you a true rog our republic of
gamers experience despite the small form
factor now there's certain things in a
SFF builds especially mini ITX
typically you're only going to get one
little PCI Express expansion slot and
there's maybe multiple things that a
gamer might want to install on there of
course in this particular instance if
you're going to be doing a gaming rig
you're going to be installing a discrete
graphics card right there so they've
tried to integrate to a pretty solid
effect I think anything else that you
might have wanted so a discreet sound
card is something that high-end gamers
really wants say have actually done a
little daughterboard implementation for
the supreme effects audio to give you
really high quality audio despite it
being motherboard audio of course
they've also included some cool stuff
like
an M PCIe combo 2 card that's a little
riser card it gives you your wireless
first of all so for Wi-Fi you get to 802
at 11a BGN AC so newest dot 11 AC
standard supported right there and that
so that's pretty cool on the little
riser card they've also given you an mg
FF form factor add-on right there so you
can put an NG F F or m dot 2 SSD and
that's the newest form factor it's
designed for like small ultra books and
that sort of thing now you also get
sonic radar as part of the supreme
effects audio which is like Steve's
favorite thing he uses an FPS games and
you can see where sounds are coming from
via a graphical layout on-screen that's
pretty cool all the rest of these specs
are all right there's for our CPU
support in memory and whatnot so if you
guys want to take a closer look that's
right there go ahead and pop open the
box there's the board it's still in the
little box and this is actually the same
board that we did a little build with so
I kind of disassembled that because it
wasn't gonna be a permanent build anyway
but you're of course gonna get your
users guide it's gonna get your RG
stickers which are very handy to have
it's gonna have your Maximus 6 impact CD
and JJ was pointing out don't throw this
away you should go to the Aces website
to download the latest drivers but
there's a couple things such as the
Kaspersky antivirus as well as daemon
tools Pro which can let you do school
stuff like doing a virtual optical drive
so you can mount iso's we need to have a
full-fledged software included so that's
only available on this disc so don't
throw it away
apart from that IO shield of course
serial ata cable a little rap for them
one two three four
pretty standard Asus ones those actually
all have the straight plugs on both ends
which I I kind of lean towards I like
having the option to go straight plugs
over the angled plugs but in a small
form-factor you're often not going to
have quite as much room for the angle
here is your antenna this is actually
Wi-Fi antenna and that's kind of a cool
thing you can spin it around so you can
set it up on the desk cover you wants
and get good a good signal but also
they've gone with these larger size
standardized antenna connectors so you
do have the option if you're positioning
this somewhere really far away from
their router for example to attach your
own antenna to those connection points
and you don't have to use an adapter
speaking of antenna or wireless card
here's that one at that little little
riser card that they have on there and
this is this is a cool device MPAs mm
PCIe combo - I really like this when
they first did it with the RG I think I
first sat on the the Maximus 5 gene
motherboard that we had and I what I
really liked about it is a couple things
first off you get your Wi-Fi and you
don't have to use an expansion slot
that's cool second off having the
ability to pop in a little SSD and use
that as like a boot drive especially for
me because I take the systems and I tend
to move them around a lot and not having
a serial ata cable sneaking off of there
with a SSD on it I just find that to be
very handy and this is n GFS so this is
an example of kind of what Asus likes to
do with their rog boards and that is
embrace new standards ng FF next
generation form factor super small form
factor and I'm kind of excited to see
where this is going to go because it
gives you the ability to not only do the
little SATA connection basically through
there but it also gives you the option
to do direct PCI Express connection
that's just part of the ng F F form
factor spec PCI Express x2 or x4 so
potential in the future we can see ng FF
form factor SSDs achieving much higher
throughput than is available on SATA at
least with SATA revision 3
a little screw popped off of that I
should probably figure out where that
goes and put it back though it goes back
there clearly but yeah I've heard from
that you got your little riser card in
there and that's also got a look how
convenient I can spin the Santa in
selnick on there of course you see that
until probably hey hey hear that this
was handy little extension there so kind
of the mini ITX version of the q
connector this actually saved my butt in
our life build that JJ and I did because
I hadn't plugged in my front panel
connectors but I was able to take them
all plug them into that I'm gonna take a
little block and that's that's why BJJ
BJJ in our build race to be fair he was
doing a water cooling bill than I was
doing a mini ITX bill the night I
skipped a bunch of stuff look new ROG
case badges those are kind of handy
edges and here is that supreme effects
audio board so as you can see gold
plated audio connectors analog audio
connectors which is actually a place for
gold plating does help with analog
connections there's your joint connector
so that's where it makes contact with
the motherboard get your shielded
supreme effects audio chip and right
there which I believe is the actual
limit double check real quick okay I'm
gonna cheat a little bit here just to
make sure I get everything right here as
far as the audio chip goes so rog
supreme FX impact 6+2 channel
high-definition audio line out digital
the audio conversion playback
signal-to-noise ratio a weighted
differential output 115 decibel pretty
pretty impressive specs right there for
audio headphone DAC playback signal
noise ratio 1 to 10 a DC recording
signal-to-noise ratio of 104 aspect that
I'm not quite as familiar with elma
premium audio capacitors doesn't caps on
they're specifically made for audio so
they're gonna reduce you know the signal
noise and that sort of thing
TI LM 4 or 5 6 - high fidelity audio op
amp so op amp is not swappable which is
something that we've seen a little bit
more frequently but a
I'm kind of dubious about the value of a
swappable op-amp but it is specifically
made for audio and supports 600 ohms
headphones so another thing that gamers
in the rog series might be interested in
using high-end headphones this one 600
ohms very nice content protection for
full rate lossless DVD audio blu-ray
playback Jack detection multi-streaming
front panel pretty cool
and of course sonic radar functionality
also built in so that's pretty sweet ok
let's take a closer look at the
motherboard so here it is the Maximus 6
impact and right here I mean just
looking at the amounts of hardware that
they've managed to wedge onto this
little mini ITX board is pretty insane
especially to consider first off so that
you still have the overclocking
capabilities that you would with a
full-fledged like ATX or micro ATX board
they have this daughter board right
there the impact power tech inside ROG
right there it's got a little it's even
got like a little backplate on it which
is pretty cool right there looks sweet
and then the the one thing that I found
when actually building with this is it
will ship with these these bolts in
place right here so you need to pop
those off and then that is where your
actual connection points are for your
mini ITX mounts a new mini ITX case the
board of course is red and black keeping
with the ROG standards for making their
boards not just very functional but also
quite appealing to look at as well
there's your 1150 socket the daughter
board of course the riser points which
is a where'd that go I totally lost it
oh they're both right here ok so these
are your these are your two connection
points here that's for your M PCIe combo
card so you would just pop it on right
there and they've also given you
Phillips head screws but give you a very
sturdy connection since those do feed
back to places where you might actually
be plugging and unplugging stuff just
keeps it that much more sturdy one other
thing I did want to point out about this
this little riser card here the MPC
combo to cart is that when you plug it
in do that real quick like that of
course you do get the you know you can
screw it down in there make sure it's
securely connected but also the way it's
all laid out right here you've got your
the position for the the audio
daughterboard right there it's going to
come out across this little section
where they've made a groove in the
heatsink but also with your ng FF form
factor your m2 connector right there you
have the ability to go with different
lengths so they're shorter versions
there's longer versions depending on
what type of capacity you have this
supports the lengths all the way up to
110 millimeters and it's going to be
protruding across the board in this
direction which means it's not
necessarily going to conflict with your
video card or the daughter board for
your audio so that's pretty handy I'm
definitely looking forward to seeing
like some super high capacity 256 gig
512 gig maybe even one terabyte ng FF
form factor cards because popping that
in right there especially for me because
that tends to set up little systems that
aren't in cases and I move them around
frequently not having a necessarily te
cable hanging out for there that has the
SSD connected to it it's just really
handy I like it okay
but apart from that's I guess that's
pretty much gonna wrap it up again this
has been a closer look at the isus
Maximus 6 impact motherboard again thank
you very much for bearing with me you
guys over the past few weeks since I've
been moving in all I know I haven't been
posting videos but looking forward to
getting the garage set up out there
which should hopefully take place in the
next couple weeks set up all my lighting
and whatnot so I can produce more videos
more frequently but thanks for watching
this one if you enjoyed it if you liked
this motherboard go ahead hit the like
button maybe I was I'm thinking they
should make that into a love button
instead of just a like button that'd be
cool
but okay I digress thanks again for
watching this video guys we'll see you
as soon as I can possibly make another
video very soon very soon I promise</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
