lately about what the cpu market will
look like next month after AMD launches
their third gen Rison processors based
on a new microarchitecture and seven
nanometer process technology Intel AMD
is biggest and essentially their only
competition on the CPU side of things is
still struggling to bring their next-gen
desktop parts to market which will be
based on a 10 nanometer process Intel's
10 nanometer Hardware has been teased
since 2015 but has also been repeatedly
delayed with a current expected launch
in late 2019 rather than berate Intel
for letting AMD catch up or going off on
how much better rise in 3000 series will
be which we won't truly know until the
reviews come out at the beginning of
July I offer a solution Intel needs
another 2,500 K the Intel Core i5 2500 K
is a legendary CPU that was introduced
on january 9th 2011 it was based on
Intel Sandy Bridge architecture and
manufactured using 32 nanometer
lithography and sold for 216 dollars per
CPU if you bought to pray of 1000 units
retail prices we're usually about 220 to
230 dollars which put it right in the
sweet spot for a mid-range gaming PC
build the 2500 K had 4 cores but no
hyper threading so four threads as well
you had to pay another 100 plus dollars
for the 2600 K to get 8 threads in those
days actually until still charges you a
heavy premium for hyper threading but
more on that in just a bit
under load 4 cores would run at 3.3 to
3.4 gigahertz and a single core would
boost to 3.7 gigahertz which wasn't too
shabby it also had a dual channel ddr3
memory controller and an eye GPU which
is a new thing at the time Intel HD
graphics 3000 integrated onto the die
sporting Gen 6 microarchitecture and 12
execution units running it up to 1,100
megahertz
just make sure that your motherboard has
video outs if you want to make use of
that AI GPU and that means a z68 board
rather than P 67 P 67 was a weird
chipset that didn't support video outs
but did support overclocking and also
had a brief recall due to a bug with the
SATA controller but I don't want to go
off on too much of a tangent about LGA
1155 motherboards I mainly wanted to
point out that Intel's motherboard
lineup
used to be even more confusing than it
is today and simplifying it would be a
good thing to wrap up my look back at
the 2500 K though I want to point out
two amazing things it had just a 95 watt
TDP
and the performance per watt at the time
made even high-end desktop users jealous
simply due to its efficiency then
finally it being a 2500 K meant that you
could overclock that's what the K means
on the end by quite a bit actually
and also quite easily if you had decent
cooling which basically meant an OG
$30.00 cooler master hyper 212 you could
literally just set the multiplier to 44
and have a stable long-term Alcor OC to
4.4 gigahertz well over a 20% bump from
stock this combination of efficiency and
performance as well as that bit of
easily accessible extra sauce that you
can get from overclocking made the 2500
K the go to gaming CPU and I know that
there are quite a few of you out there
who are still running the Sandy Bridge
champion today and that long-term
viability is something that also isn't
often discussed that means that the 2500
K was even more of a value for the money
and here's where I think Intel has
really lost the plot in recent years
they just went far too long with that
legitimate competition from AMD I would
say about 10 years from the late 2000s
up until first gen Rison in 2017 and
their CPUs just seemed to offer less and
less value in the interim while
performance plateaued on top of that
they decided that four cores was enough
for the mainstream market
hyper-threading should cost you at least
a $100 premium and that platform
longevity beyond one to two years was
simply unnecessary none of these choices
were consumer friendly and AMD has in my
opinion pointed this out in glaring
fashion with their competing mainstream
Rison products for well over two years
now
if Intel wants to win back gamers and PC
enthusiasts I think there are four
things that they need to do with the new
version of the 2500 K which I am
advising them to make and sell as soon
as possible so first off until no more
skimping on cores and threads AMD has
made hyper threading or simultaneous
multi-threading a standard even at the
lower end of their product stack and
Intel needs to stop pretending that
they're hyper threading tech is some
magic price inflating unicorn AMD has
already listed the names pricing and
specs of their 3000 series CPUs in the
200 to 250 dollar price range that the
2500 case successors should be living in
there is the risin 5 3600 X which is a
6-quart well thread 3.8 gigahertz to 4.4
gigahertz CPU with a 35 megabyte cache
95 watt TDP and 249 dollar price tag and
then there's also the horizon 5 3600
also six cores and twelve threads
running at 3.6 to 4.2 gigahertz with a
65 watt TDP for 199 dollars note that
both of these are unlocked so it's safe
to assume that a savvy user could
probably buy the $200 3600 and overclock
it to just about equivalent performance
to the 3600 X if you want more cores and
threads AMD is starting its eight core
16 thread line up at three hundred and
thirty dollars with the 3700 X just FYI
so there it is Intel you need to match
AMD here with a six core 12 thread CPU
nothing less will be acceptable in this
price range next I want a long-term or
at least longer term a platform for
intel's next generation of desktop CPUs
by platform I mean the motherboard and
chipset line-up AMD launched their
socket a.m. for platform back in 2017
and promised to keep it viable through
2020 I think they lived up to that
promise with three generations of Rison
CPUs living on the same platform meaning
that some users who invested in a 300
series motherboard back in 2017 will be
able to drop in a new CPU in 2019 or
2020 with more cores and threads than
expected without doing a complete system
overhaul I think there is value in that
as well and I would love to see Intel
commit to something similar with a few
generations of CPUs planned for the same
socket motherboards this would also be
an improvement over the original 2500 K
which had two generations of
motherboards in its LGA 1155 socket z68
originally and then z77 these were
launched in 2011 and 2012
next is frequency and overclocking which
are becoming more and more important for
Intel especially if the third gen Rison
specs that we have seen so far are
consistent higher frequency directly
impacts instructions for clock
performance and IPC is where the battle
has raged in the past couple years when
comparing AMD and Intel given how much
time they have been working on 10
nanometer I'm really hoping that we'll
see frequencies go beyond 5 gigahertz
especially with more advanced cooling
ideally the new 2500 K would hit 4.5 to
5 gigahertz at stock giving it a head
start over the rise in 3000 series when
it comes to frequency and then also have
the potential to go to 5 point 4 or 5
points 5 gigahertz if you want to spend
some time overclocking or if you upgrade
your cooling solution frequency isn't
everything of course but I'd love to get
back to that satisfying feeling of
getting more for your money by just
making a few tweaks to the UEFI which is
really what overclocking is all about
finally as is pretty much the case with
I guess pretty much everything in the
world we need a good price I think going
back to the 220 or 230 dollar cost of
the original 2500 K would be a good idea
it would actually undercut AMD's 3,600 X
and it's a really good price for a
mid-range one thousand dollar build was
plenty of budget left over for a GPU and
other components
I think PC gamers are getting tired of
feeling like they need to spend another
hundred dollars for more cores and then
another hundred dollars for
hyper-threading only to find that the
cpu they want is now in the 400 to 500
dollar price range when AMD is offering
these specs and features for much less
consider that the eight core 16 thread
Intel 9900 K right now is 495 dollars
while the AMD 2700 X is two hundred and
eighty-five dollars still with eight
cores and 16 threads more than $200
cheaper yes the IPC is better with the
9900 K what is it two hundred dollars
better most gamers would rather just
spend that money on a better GPU so
Intel give us a this is all you need
kickass CPU in the 200 to 250 dollar
price range and watch how much gamers
will love you for it so that's my
solution in late 2019 or even early 2020
Intel needs to launch a 2500 K Redux a
$220 bang for the buck overclocking
beast with six cores 12 threads and a
reasonable TDP at around 100 watts put
down a new platform with a new socket
and let us know that you'll be using
that platform for three years at minimum
and then actually follow through on that
also please don't call it to 2500 K
Redux or anything make a simplified
product naming system for the new CPUs
it doesn't confuse people oh and also
just one more thing
Intel please update and improve your
stock CPU cooler and go back to
including it even with the case cube
processors budget builds need CPU
coolers too and no cooler in the box
with the CPU means you need to add 20 to
30 dollars to the base price so that you
can just keep the system up and running
and that's pretty much all I have for
today guys thank you so much for
watching and let me know if you would
buy this CPU or the theoretical new
version of the CPU
if Intel launched it and if it would
change your feelings about Intel at all
if you've been feeling negatively about
them to any degree alternatively if you
think there's some other key feature
that this theoretical new CPU needs that
I didn't mention and let me know in the
comments section below as well don't

while you're edit we'll see you guys in
