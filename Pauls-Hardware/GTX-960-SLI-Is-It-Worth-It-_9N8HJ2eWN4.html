right up here at the top that allows you
to use two of the cards together at the
same time it's called sli or a scalable
link interface and the gtx 960 can
support up to two way configurations for
today's video I'm going to be going over
one of EVGA Zanu gtx 960 s the SSC or
super-super clocked and also be running
some benchmarks to answer this sli
question is two of these for $400 a
viable gaming solution or should you opt
for a single higher-end card like the
gtx 970 or nine eight either way you
should like this video before proceeding
so let's start off with a closer look at
EVGA s take on the GTX 960 the SSC
version at least which will run you
about two hundred and ten dollars MSRP
there a CX 2.0 plus cooler design is
very similar to what we've seen on their
970 and 980 models with some minor
changes you still get double ball
bearing fans which use less power and
have a longer lifespan swept fan blades
and a sizable fin stack beneath the
plastic shroud the heatsink has been
updated with three straight copper heat
pipes or SHP straight heat pipes that
extend the length of the card as well
and like the 970 and the 980 the fans
don't spin up at all until this GPU
reaches 60 degrees Celsius or warmer
EVGA calls this DB noise inverter
because I guess all of the manufacturers
decided to name their fans not spinning
technology this year on the back you can
see the black PCB no backplate
unfortunately but if that's your thing
you can step up - EVG BGA's FTW or for
the win version of the gtx 960 which
does include a backplate there is a I'm
going to call it a front plate between
the cooler and the PCB basically what
this does is a memory and mosfet cooling
solution that's going to keep those
components about 10 degrees cooler
compared to not having one on their EVGA
also integrates a dual BIOS system with
a switch right here physically on the
board which allows you to have a backup
BIOS ready in case of an extreme
overclocking failure or to keep two
profiles on tap and easily be able to
switch between them this is a dual slot
card length is 10.1 inches or 250
millimeters and EVGA also improved the
power delivery over the reference design
by adding a six plus to phase power
delivery system and a peg an 8-pin peg
power connector instead of a six pin and
an optimized power target that provides
33% more power to the GPU according to
EVGA a four watt power supply is
recommended video outs include three
DisplayPort 1.2 s1 HDMI 2.0 and one dual
link DVI with a single card my maximum
GPU temperature during testing was 72
degrees Celsius average power draw was
about 250 watts under load never peaking
above 300 so very very power efficient
just like the 970 and 980 when it comes
to the core component tree you'll find
the GM 206 GPU right at the center of
this which EVGA has overclocked to 1279
megahertz based and 1342 megahertz boost
frequency during testing this card
actually boost it up all the way to 1418
megahertz right out the box from the
manufacturer and in a two way
configuration both of the GPUs were
humming along at about 1404 without any
manual overclocking lastly we have two
gigabytes of gddr5 memory on a 128-bit
bus and this has been a sticking point
with some folks particularly those who
were hoping that this card could handle
some entry-level 4k gaming feel free to
check out my first gtx 960 video where i
show that this card should really only
be considered for 1080 gaming but what
about two of them well let's check out
some sli benchmarks so thank you once
again to Intel and EVGA and g.skill for
providing the 59 60 X X 99 classified
and the Ripjaws ddr4 memory kit used in
my test bed also remember that the two
gigabyte frame buffer in the 960 does
not add up to 4 gigabytes when you SLI
two of them together there's still just
two gigs per GPU which is not going to
help out the high res benchmarks and yes
is alive the EVGA gtx 960 and the zotac
960 for these tests because that's -
that I have it's heresy I know 3d mark
firestrike ultra is pretty brutal at 4k
so although we saw decent sli scaling on
normal and extreme mode ultra maxed out
the 2gig memory buffer and caused enough
slowdown to negate any benefits BioShock
Infinite continues this trend we see
decent scaling
1080 and 1440 but not so much at 4k if
you're just looking at average frame
rate the 960 sli will usually land
between the 970 and 980 at standard HD
resolution as graphically intense as
Metro last light is the built in
benchmark actually doesn't use more than
two gigs even at 4k so here you can see
the sli 960s doing a bit better at 4k
and beating out the 970 now I usually
rate anything less than 10 FPS as
unplayable so I have no idea how I got
through the SLI 960 benchmark run in
Crysis 3 it was pretty terrible that
said it was actually able to best the
GTX 980 at 1080p here the battlefield 4
numbers again also reinforced this trend
again we have pretty good scaling at
1080p and just a note to anyone trying
to play battlefield 4 at 4k with a GTX
960 please don't and so it last we come
to the conclusion if you watched my
intro video for the GTX 960 then you
know that I would have liked to have
seen just a little bit more from this
GPU and then I was saddened by the
relatively small memory buffer and the
128 bit interface don't get me wrong
though if you're gaming at 1080 and
there's nothing wrong with that and you
don't plan to upgrade your monitor for
let's say the next year or two and
there's also nothing wrong with that
this is a very great budget card with
very low power requirements I also like
EVGA is take on the gtx 960 SSC which
runs very cool and very quiet although i
and the coalition of tech youtubers will
continue to give them grief for the lack
of backplate when many other vendors are
using them even on lower tier models we
know that you have back plates EVGA and
we want them but sli though do i
recommend it with the gtx 960 know like
pretty much straight up no but why well
i usually don't recommend multi-gpu
setups at all when a single more
powerful GPU is available
the reason is sli scaling can be a huge
issue with games although most of the
games I tested today do have good SLI
scaling their triple-a titles this isn't
always the case in many games you'll get
zero benefit with the second card or
even a slightly lower frame rate with
two cards versus one the single
situation that I can see sli working for
this configuration or for this GPU is if
you have a monitor like this one right
here to my right this is the Asus 1080p
144 Hertz high refresh rate
this is the 120 but it's a high refresh
rate monitor and I can see a 960 SL is
getting you closer to 120 or 144 FPS to
match the refresh rate of your monitor
and you wouldn't really have to worry as
much about memory limitations because
you're still 1920 by 1080 for a 60 Hertz
1080 I think a single 960 does just fine
and for any higher anything that uses a
higher resolution than that I think
you'd be better off with a GTX 970 or an
AMD r9 290 for that matter given the
tantalizing price drops that team red
has been responding to this launch with
and that's all for this video thank you
