that it is all right I shall be
streaming live to YouTube so hello
everyone I am giving it just a second oh
you know I should do I should mute this
alright good
that's better hi guys welcome to this
somewhat impromptu Q&amp;amp;A video I want to
start off by saying that yes I'm angry
super angry I've been trying to maintain
my anger to make it last throughout the
video so I will be you know feeding it
to you a little bit at a time and I want
to point out from the start here that
this entire video is powered by the Sun
yes my power wall and solar system is up
and running so over here I have we're
already getting four and a half thousand
kilowatts that's just before 10 a.m.
here in Southern California 3.6
kilowatts is charging the home and I'm
using just shy of a thousand kilowatts
to power this this video and all the
electronics in my home right now so cool
but hey the main point of this video is
to address something that's come up in
the past 24 hours it's affected several
of us tech youtubers if you follow us
myself bit what Kyle js2 since Hardware
unboxed gamers Nexus and it's all sort
of derived from a couple things
originally I guess video cards posted
something vaguely related to this but
they did not name names and then there
was an individual who came and posted
something yesterday basically accusing a
lot of us who had gone to Computex in
Taipei Taiwan which I was at all last
week still kind of getting over the jet
lag from that of basically taking money
in order to go to booth so the the
accusation was that any of the Computex
coverage that you saw from me all those
booths were not me
going to Computex and deciding I want to
cover this or this or this it was me
going and saying hey you want me to come
cover you you better pay me money that's
absolutely false it's completely wrong
I am not sure if there is any legal
recourse involved here I'm not currently
planning on calling up the lawyers or
anything like that but there is
apparently some additional information
that I'm not going to go into right now
that does affect other people
personal stuff that again I'm not going
to go into details for but it's it's a
concern because we have the tech
community rely almost entirely on our
integrity and I personally have a strong
philosophy of doing the right thing as
well as purity of intense I want to do
what's right by you guys because I have
a lot of respect for anyone who has
chosen to follow me to subscribe to me
on my channel and I think it is
absolutely wrong to mislead you guys in
any way
and in particular I think accepting
money for coverage of something is one
of the ways in which viewers can
sometimes be misled
there is the way there are ways of doing
it rights to do sponsored videos to
disclose that upfront and that gives you
guys the foreknowledge of okay when I'm
watching is sponsored but personally I
do not do any wholly sponsored videos I
accept money for pre-roll ad
integrations that I post at the
beginning of videos and in the case of
something like Computex which involves a
lot of money investments up front to pay
for plane tickets and hotels and to
bring an editor along with me and pay
for food all of that requires a little
bit more money than your typical day to
day videos so when I go to Computex
I get a group of sponsors I put their
logos at the beginning of the video and
I say this coverage is brought to you by
these people and they helped me to go
there and travel and bring that content
to you that's pretty much all I do and
it's it's been a personal decision of
mine to not do sponsored videos for one
thing it just makes it easier because I
do I mean I'm I'm blessed to be
successful enough to the point where I
get I get people who come to me
manufacturers who say hey we'd love to
have you show our product on your
channel you know we could we could pay
you for it and I always say I don't do
sponsored videos I've
I've replied to people with that
multiple times just in the past month
when people have approached me with that
kind of thing I'd like to keep the
separation there simply because not only
does would accepting the sponsorship for
a video mean that I have to then go and
do that video for that person and I like
to keep my videos a little bit more
geared towards what I'm interested in
and what I want to do but it also in my
personal opinion serve detracts from the
integrity of the video itself if it
wasn't something that I just considered
thought of Tim to create organically
versus a separate third party coming and
say hey hey saying hey do you want to
make this video we'll pay you money for
it so that's that's how I do it
more specifically this morning
I caught on some follow up from that
original the original tweet was from an
individual who's shut their Twitter
account down on everything and just to
show some of the fallout fallout from
something like this heard OCP followed
up with that with some statements that I
thought were were incredibly misleading
and deceptive and also showed no
integrity towards for instance what we
had recently praised heart out he heart
OCP for in the past couple months which
was the coverage of GPP and sort of
drawing that on to the public and being
well researched and looking at multiple
sources and the immediate response from
her dose of heart OCP following up with
that was like oh yeah youtubers it's all
pay to play and like you know you
wouldn't believe the some huge sums of
money that I paid for exposure exposure
are huge and even like the suggestion
the suggestion and this that Kyle said
in Computex
in 1998 I was offered prostitutes to
cover companies products like that's not
said directly but it's in the same
goddamn tweet accusing us on all the
people included in this of pay-to-play
and that's pretty freakin offensive I
hold myself to some pretty high ethical
standards and that's absolute
 so I got no more to say on it
than that but this is supposed to be a
Q&amp;amp;A video I hope that was a bit of anger
for you've been trying to you know keep
that high up but let's move on just
actually some of the questions because
I'm going to try to keep this video but
to
the 10 to 15-minute range if possible
okay
first question is from cell cells
moderator and our live show we do on
Tuesdays which is coming back next week
by the way once Kyle gets back from
Japan he that's what--when crap like
this happens how do you still find joy
in what you do is it worth it and some
follow-up questions are there there I
mean you kind of have to roll with it
sometimes it's it's one of the downsides
to to success in some degree like I have
I have a level of success that I'm
fairly proud of that I'm also very
grateful for but along with that is
gonna come people who for some reason
think that I'm not deserving of it and
you know there's there's psychology that
goes into that I've been somewhat open
in the past that like I've struggled
with depression like that's a common
thing and when you have people sort of
attacking you with stuff like this yes
it can it can sort of drive you down
like that so I try to maintain
positivity stay positive by wearing the
shirt of course and also just trying to
focus on things that I do that bring me
joy and that give me a feeling of
accomplishment and also that give me a
feeling that I've helped people that's
often why I tend to focus a little bit
more on entry-level stuff with computers
and I often don't go into quite as much
depth as like gamers Nexus is because I
try to make things approachable and
understandable for people so I don't so
anyway I I hope that answers that
question I know I got I ramble a bit but
another question from Moises is these
are all questions that were just
responded to the tweet that I posted
just before the show how are you I'm
doing okay again a little upset but
trying to maintain positivity brian says
well being a bad mood mean we will see
some emotion coming from you well you be
the judge Brian trying not to be too
emotional trying to maintain dignity and
decorum but so it goes oh thank you for
the hugs pop guys thank you thanks for
the donations in chat by the way as well
I appreciate you guys jumping in there
and saying that but I'm I'm I'm probably
not going to get to the those actual
questions but I do have a few more from
Twitter lined up here Dan 101 out of
pure curiosity and nothing else how do
you make your money
is kind of like Jays to sense videos and
- has also done it video in the past so
I tweeted yesterday because when when
when accusations kind of come out of the
woodwork like this oftentimes they're
pretty baseless and they don't get much
uptake this one there's a little bit
more going on behind the scenes which is
I think why there was more of a response
from various youtubers like myself Jay
posted a video last night and it's
important it's important again integrity
is is so key making sure that you guys
know that I'm doing everything to bring
you guys honest and true information is
also important and it's stupid that I
feel like I have to tout that because
it's the exact opposite of what I want
to do is to be like hey guys look leave
this stuff I'm doing that's good I don't
I don't like to do that and so it's it
seems like almost a step backwards to
try to do things with integrity and
honestly and then come and then have to
like make a video be like see look look
at me doing things right and everything
but you kind of have to at some point
especially when accusations got like
this so more to the point of answering
your question I would direct you to that
video it's called how I run my youtube
channel where I sort of make lots of
statements and there's basically three
main ways that I make money one is from
YouTube Adsense revenue and that's if
you guys watch ads before the video if
you don't have ad blocker or if you
whitelist me or if you just watch the
video and you get an ad show and I get a
percentage of that money same goes for
YouTube bread if you're signed up for
YouTube bread and you watch my videos
depending on how many videos you watch I
forget exactly how its perched out but I
can see like a certain percentage of the
YouTube ad revenue is from YouTube bread
a second way that I make money is
through those add integrations and those
I line up directly with sponsors and try
to make sure it's always stuff that's
relevant to the concept I produce as and
also products that I'm are reasonably
good that no one's gonna get no one's
gonna buy that product and feel like oh
like Paul really led me wrong with that
pre-roll ad he did I usually try to make
those 20 seconds or less and a little
trick if you guys are watching my videos
on the YouTube and you want to skip
because I know with ad integrations you
can't skip them a double or a triple tap
on the right side when you're watching
in the YouTube app on your phone will
jump forward 20 seconds and you can skip
the ad or like two right arrow clicks if
you're watching in the browser I try to
make them easy to jump forward because I
know not everyone likes to watch those
what's the other the other way I make
money is my nice my store so if you guys
want to buy merchandise you can go to
pulsar bread Nets and I sell merch like
mugs fun stuff it's all high-quality and
that's I make a little bit a little bit
of money to I think that's it
right Oh Amazon Amazon referral links
have account with Amazon and I also have
an account with them what is it
double click Africa do I have another
account so like if I linked his places
like new egg if I link you to a product
and you go through there and you buy
something then I get a small commission
from that which is pretty standard just
about every youtuber does it - also
explains that in his video as well so
that's how I make my money note that
none of those things was someone coming
and saying hey Paul can I pay you five
thousand dollars and you make this video
that we want you to make covering this
product that you wouldn't have made
otherwise I don't do that same thing
with the booth coverage at at Computex
so moving on a few more questions I'll
try to get through these quick since
I've already gone over my estimated
amount of time a little bit alley
Ramesh's did you use a gaming laptop for
video rendering or where you provided
with a PC during your Computex trip I've
tried taking like portable systems on
the go slick for CES I've been bringing
a physical system that's like more
full-sized and that helps excuse me that
helps with rendering because full-size
systems are a little bit better this guy
p-tech strip one of my sponsors was
gigabyte and completely unrelated to the
gigabytes ad contract that they signed
up to put their little logo at the
beginning I asked hey you guys have a
laptop that we could borrow and use for
the trip because I have a razor blade
but I like to grab something else for my
editor
use and they provided this which is a
gigabyte arrow 14 it still sits small
which is nice the screen size is a
little smaller smallish for us I believe
this is what a 15.6 inch screen no sorry
it's 14 inch screen
hence arrow 14 but it's got a quad-core
7700 Shh Q + 16 gigs of ram and this was
perfectly adequate for editing and
rendering the videos at Computex and no
i wasn't paid to put that in Nick hey
it's just a question that was fast I
have to explain myself so often alright
daymo crickets ed is their PC relay to
perch that if you could design or sell
your own that you would do recently I
have been I had a chance to check out
the 11 dynamic from Leon Lee that der
bauer worked with them for and I like to
see a lot of sort of little little
touches that I think maybe maybe weirder
bars idea I don't know exactly what was
what but I think a case would be cool
every case that comes out has sort of
different nuances to it and it would be
interested to take interesting to take
all the things that I like most about a
case and try to have a case manufacturer
make that and put that together I've
done nothing to pursue anything like
that but maybe in the future
a few more Lamont Cranston favorite new
tech Computex I'd have to say there were
some cool cases that came out I liked
the evolved X as far as all the cases I
thought it was just when it comes to
price and everything you can put in into
it I thought they did a good job with
that need to test actual wire flow and
everything of course still but I think
he's probably at the 32 core thread
refer to which is supposed to come out
in August I thought that was a big
announcement and a little bit more
practical than Intel's
28 core hey and I could go into a
separate side tangent about the drama
around that too but let's let's not make
this video too long
torch games studio says what what's your
advice what's your best advice for an
absolute beginner diving into the world
of PC building one ignore the haters
that's that's an important part of it
but I would say you just have a day job
have something that you can support
yourself with don't immediately try to
support yourself with the YouTube
channel make sure it's something you
enjoy doing from like from its core you
need to enjoy the technology you need to
enjoy the
production process as well as the entire
process through editing and uploading if
you don't like all those things then one
of them will start to be feel like a
drag on your production and just make
videos that you enjoy and remember
there's no shame in getting a product
reviewing it and then returning it if
you're having a difficult having
difficulty from the get-go finding stuff
to do videos on one last question from
Jason B how many times have you
accidentally stuck your fingers in a
running case fan I was originally gonna
say way too many to count but then I
realized he says accidentally because
stopping a case fan blade with my
fingers was off in a way that I would
use to actually determine what the
loudest fan in a case was so I would
just go and stop the fans to be like
nope all right that woman wasn't the
loud one and when it comes to that just
many I've done that many many times but
I probably probably at least 10 or 15
times it's usually a nice wake-up call
and perhaps shaves a little bit of skin
off of your knuckles but guys that's
pretty much all the time I have for this
video I didn't want to make it too long
just wanted to address a few things
there might be more on this topic in the
future who really knows but this is
pretty much all I have to say about it
for now but we'll probably redress this
next week on the live show we should be
back next Tuesday and was that five six
or five days or so 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time on twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
as well as my youtube channel and Kyle's
YouTube channel and I should maybe have
one or two more videos coming up later
this week too and also I do have the
parts coming in for my 1,000 deep build
back there which I'm very excited to
move on to the next step for water
cooling parts from aqua cool apical aqua
tuning alpha cool okay thanks for
watching this video though guys hit the
thumbs up button if you did enjoy it and
I'll be back soon angry angry I'm very
all right now I'm calm now gonna go get
some more breakfast jet lag just makes
you want to eat all the time goth
