Ontario International Airport that's
Ontario International Airport in
Southern California not actually in
Canada
boarded a flight and I came up here to
Seattle Washington and I am now here
where land syndicate will be happening
land syndicate is a land of its land
means local area network back in the
late 90s and early 2000s lands were very
popular events people would go to them
bring their computers Network them all
together and play multiplayer games
after the internet became better and you
had broadband high-speed connections LAN
events became less popular but a lot of
people are nostalgic for them there's
there's reasons why you know it's
important to gather together in medias
groups and all that kind of stuff so in
that spirits Logan and Jennifer and Kane
and Wendel and all the good folks over
at Texan ticket have put together this
event Lansing to get this the first one
I think there might be more of them in
the future
this entire area it's gonna be packed
with gamers there's gonna be beer and
probably as would be expected many many
shenanigans so this is going to be my
video covering a little bit of the
events giving you guys a little bit of
the experience if you're unable to be
here I hope you enjoy it let's see what
happens
so much power power limit this power no
one man should control should be enough
beer any will this be enough beer 70
gallons or 700 pounds
I'm 900 pounds of beer and metal apple
cider so this one will be all for cane
we also have Firestone rookie jack
we have ballast point grapefruit sculpin
IPA with natural grape fruit flavours I
won't be having that here's here's a
Firestone Union Jack IPA free month
brewing this is a summer Gale we also
have Lucille India Pale Ale well there's
lots of IPAs here you might you might
think Logan had something to do with
this events Firestone firewalker which
is a nitrile felt natural velvet merlin
oatmeal stuff actually I will be
drinking lots of this and we have GG
guys is the morning of what its gonna be
day one of slain syndicate and before we
jump over to the events I want to give
you a quick tour of the Airbnb where
state is it's pretty nice
anyway I'm just doing entryway behind me
here behind you is the rest of the place
so bathroom is actually right here this
is very nice I just showered in there
and and everything works just
beautifully I guess I don't need to give
you guys it will tour the bathroom it
anyway they're just got some you know a
little sitting area here some
instructions for we're supposed to do
nothing in that closet day
I'm sure what's behind this door it's
locked I'll try to Jimmy it open later
no not really that'd be rude and here's
the main area
it's more light in here it's a little
bit messy cuz I have been well I slept
out here but we got a little kitchenette
yeah looking good frigerator table here
for dining or I've been using it as a
work area actually I need to post my
video ASAP look I brought like a second
monitor for my laptop so so that's very
handy anyway entertainment area over
there we got this this is actually quite
useful for heating as well as just
ambience you know just hit the button
there and you go get a nice fireplace
super cool so I slept out here on the
couch actually I need to make my bed get
everything nice and tidy and of course
there's one room here cuz I'm also
staying it's not just me but it's also
Kyle and Heather so and they locked the
door you can read my damn face I just
wanted to show people that we now have
coffee thanks a fee and then we're ready
to face a day and we also got quiche
Heather Heather is eating quiche it's
okay it's really good quiches so that's
the coffee shops in Seattle you go in
and they just have quiche ready for you
right there guys I'm here with Sean and
Sean like where you from what do you do
hi I'm from San Francisco and I want a
bar actually fantastic Sean has been
serving us out the holiday in a very
responsible way

gift for me I also wanted to take a
brief moment and pause and say thank you
to Kyle for running the camera right now
but uh Thank You Kyle
Sean wanted to be present to me this
gift in full view of you guys at home as
well as Kyle of course behind the camera
what I'm I'm very interested what do you

well actually I know you're a big fan of
various views from around the world I am
I enjoy I know the barrier has some good
ones we thought we'd bring you a few of
these oh that's just for you yeah
something kind of difficult to get a
hold of it's very difficult we've got a
whole bag of them and you know what
these are only for you just me just you
I have to drink them and not share them
with anyone else I really
let's share these what and what about
what about hold on hold on can I anyone

just me just him okay okay all right
just all right there's a whole bagful of
them but I just we go to Paul I mean
there's a wait there's a whole okay okay
okay the resale value alone on these is
it would be through the roof it's quite
nice of course I that's that bag so
thank you very much thank you I them for
everything so I'm a big fan
hey I appreciate that thank you very
much and thank you for handling the camp
thanks guy appreciate that thank you do
to lily weird rules about the greater
Seattle and possibly Washington area
once the food is gone they have to stop
selling beer so each sparingly but eat
and just you know wait to the last
minute so don't make them run out of
food real quick we want to drink till
the we go home right isn't that the case
yeah Wendell's working our traffic
shaper right now because stop looking at
speed tests seriously all you're really
doing is ruining it for everybody next
to you and when I find out who's
actually doing this over and over again
I'm just gonna point that's him and let
the entire rest of you guys descend upon
them so do you guys know what makes Land
Syndicate happen Steve hey Steve makes
Len syndicate I know there's so many
people are doing a tremendous amount
more I'm talking to the knight great and
I'm staying at you but
no because of people like him I'm
looking forward to me I will not get out
there's only one of those many em right
here because I'm guys all have you're
taking my phone I love you Steve and I
need your help
let us down Steve I'm going to speak so
guys land syndicate right
you've already been watching this video
so you kind of know what this is all
about but right now everything is
actually up and running that's right we
have internet there's beer and there's
food so we're gonna do a quick to kind
of run through of what's going on here
and so over here we have the epic pants
store that is right they do not sell any
pants so better than everything else
they have specials specials going on
right now for all lands syndicate
attendees John and Sookie are both back
here and they're wonderful people they
help keep all of the like merchandise
stores running not just for my store but
also for protection ticket also for Kyle
and aka awesomesauce Network and they're
also wonderful people
Sookie was wearing my shirt yesterday I
was like it's awesome so anyway you guys
can't buy any stuff here cuz you're not
here but good epic pense comm they're
gonna buy a big pants stop we're going
to my store gonna buy my stuff over here
is kind of a general land area
is set in stacks of 10 people so you got
10 dunno 10 desks for 20 people they're
all I end up everything is networked in
that there's power and internet which is
very important
unfortunately Comcast had some issues
earlier today but thanks to Wendell and
Kane as well as Steve like everything's
working now so everyone that a cheer of
applause went up when the internet
started working and now people can play
games against each other online talk
about the empty game room that hasn't
been set up yet also guys if you haven't
seen it there's posters on all the walls
in here guess who helped to put those
posters up me but not just me there was
lots of people helping James James was
really helpful with that and Shawn
another Shawn not Shawn by the way Shawn
is running the camera right now he's
joined Tek syndicate and he's really
nice guy
way better than Edsel way better than it
and finally one of the really important
locations here land syndicate which is
outside because you know legalities this
is where you can drink beer it's all
unfenced
with the cage you know when you start to
drink beer people might get rowdy you
want to make sure we can close these
gates at any time and lock all the beer
drinkers in so that they can't escape to
taint the experience with the rest of
people who are calmly playing
video games in Atlanta a place they have
lovely selection of beers though and I
think I'm gonna go and drink one right
now okay guys it's now Lance etiquette
day two and good news Internet's been
great today there's actual gaming going
on it's a very exciting but not just
gaming going on at Lancer ticket no
there's also tabletop games there's a
tabletop game area but over in that area
earlier there was an epic battle of wits
as people answer trivia questions put
together by Steve in order to win some
creative labs that's a sound blaster
head says the song was part of the
winning team for that yeah great job I
think he kind of I probably bribed Steve
to learn all the answers to the
questions before they start of the show
most likely that's how it went down I
actually had I was part of a team
originally but then I abandoned them so
they decided to call themselves balls
former subs they were in it till the
very end and in the last question which
was about Unreal Tournament they kind of
a kind of fell apart it was a very
strong effort though very strong effort
I was impressed anyway I said from all
that cane recently had a biological
implant placed in his hand that's right
something that you might not expect an
event like this but vial implants they
put a RFID or NFC chips actually into
your freaking hands they'll do left or
right hands gain had one installed that
he can now use to like open the
electronic lock at wherever wherever the
help game lives that's pretty
fascinating I've had quite a few people
ask me what setup I brought here to land
syndicates and prepare to be
disappointed because I did not actually
bring a full system I am sitting here
next to Joker though he's over there he
got a full system set up and good to go
so I'm I'm a little jealous but this was
a little bit easier to transport so I've
got my g550 JK laptop this is my
standard laptop that I use most of
because it's my laptop I do have this
little add-on monitor here this is you
know it's not a spectacular monitor it's
a aoc plugs in via a USB 2 though and it
just provides you a little little extra
screen space so you can throw up a
chatroom or anything like that for
peripherals I got the Razer DeathAdder a
very classic old-school Mouse this is
kind of my portable Mouse all of my
video games my Steam library and
everything your on my course Air Force
GS 500 gig SSD right there and which
actually works great for when at steam
games off of and everything and then I
have this just obscene set of
peripherals over here as well as a USB
2.0 hub that all that's kind of running
off of so the mouse is plugged in over
here the my my Xbox 360 controllers
plugged over here plugged in over here
my headset my sennheiser headset was
originally designed to plug in directly
to my laptop but I've discovered this
laptop actually doesn't really have all
that great of audio which is kind of
disappointing so as a temporary solution
I'm running this Sound Blaster XG 5
which is like an external deck by Sound
Blaster and it's actually working pretty
nice so far so that's cool just got my
mic and head flow headphone plugged into
that and it's also a pass-through so I
literally have a USB 2.0 out going into
this which is passing through into my
USB 2.0 hub which has my controller and
my mouse and everything plugged into it
but it's it's actually working which I'm
surprised about that also gives me an
extra USB port to plug the monitor in
over here and then one more USB 3.0 port
to plug in my storage everything does
you can maybe see my set up here the LAN
syndicate is not quite as as epic as
some people I'm just working on a laptop
but it's been doing a good job I'm
pretty excited and I feel like I have
enough peripherals laid out on either
side of it it kind of makes up for my
lack of actually having a desktop
anyway this is gonna kind of be the end
of this video but I want to show you one
more thing that is a little bit of a
montage of all the epic actual gaming
systems that people have brought here to
play with and show off with add to play
and syndicate so I'll leave you with
that thanks for watching everybody
everybody hit the thumbs-up button and
subscribe and all that good stuff like
you know how to do
I am working
