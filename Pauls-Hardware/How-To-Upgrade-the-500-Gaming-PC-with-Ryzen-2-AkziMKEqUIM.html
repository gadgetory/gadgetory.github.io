more what's up guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware today's video is how to
upgrade a computer not any computer but
specifically the computer that I built
over the past couple months this was
meant to be an entry-level PC less than
$500 to get yourself off to the races
with an AMD and 4 socket motherboard and
an AMD Rison 320 200 G processor this is
the box for that one in there and the
reason we went with this specific
processor is because it's new it's a
quad core it's only 99 bucks and it's
got Vega graphics integrated so this
system has been running off of
integrated graphics that's part of the
processor since I've been testing it
over the past couple months now part of
my MO for this build was that it would
have an upgrade path and whenever I
recommend parts to people for building a
computer I will often tell them do you
think it can upgrade this in the future
part of the joy and benefit of building
your own computer is the ability to
upgrade it when you have more money and
now that it is I want to say early to
mid 2018 maybe your tax return just came
in or maybe it was your birthday and you
got some money or something like that
all that is to say you've got some cash
you're ready to upgrade your system how
are you gonna go about doing that first
you got to choose the parts to upgrade
to you got to make sure everything's
still compatible and then of course
there's a physical process of doing
installation now our primary upgrade for
today is going to be the CPU central
processing unit the 2200 G that's
already in there now since that's a CPU
and graphics card we're going to need to
add a graphics card in as well
but the CPU we're going to be upgrading
to this this is the Rison 520 600 X it's
the new Rison 2 series of processors
although it's still backwards compatible
with our existing b3 15 motherboard and
AM for socket one thing about this
processor is it's only a processor does
not include graphics so that means that
we're going to need to upgrade our
graphics at the same time
by adding a graphics card we didn't have
one before I'm gonna choose the graphics
card in just a minute here because GPU
prices are still pretty high but there's
some that are a little bit more
reasonable than others and I should also
mention that this CPU being part of the
rise in two series is based on Zen plus
architecture it's a twelve nanometer
process instead of 14 nanometer there's
a few other benefits to this processor
as well and it can run at a higher
frequency than the last generation 1600
X now I can't actually give you guys any
performance numbers of the CPU yet
because it's not launching until next
week but I can do the installation show
you physically how to put it in and then
in a follow-up video I will show you
guys some actual benchmarking numbers to
show you what kind of performance you
get by jumping up to this six core
twelve thread processor from our four
core for thread processors that's part
of the our APU
now before we move into our upgrade
options I wanted to quickly also point
out that along with the rise in two
processors that are launching April 19th
there's also a new lineup of
motherboards you'll find that they're
400 series in other words so we have X
470 and B 460
that's as compared to last generation
which was X 370 and B 350 now you're not
going to get a huge amount of extra
performance or anything like that by
going with the 400 series motherboards
rather than the 300 series motherboards
but if you're buying a new rise and 2
processor right now it might be worth
looking into the 400 series motherboards
that are available just to see what's
out there and I am told at least with
overclocking the higher-end processors
it is a good bet to go with the 400
series motherboards but you can get by
just fine with the 300 series
motherboards the last thing to mention
about the motherboards as mentioned in
the follow up video on this original
build is that you want to make sure that
you have compatibility compatibility is
there but the motherboard itself might
need an update depending on when it was
manufactured so let's begin by going
over to the support page for our
motherboard the a B 350 in gaming Wi-Fi
in this case from gigabytes and if we go
down to the support area we can find
BIOS versions over here and we can
actually see that since this motherboard
was first manufactured back in June of
2017 they've had five six seven eight
different Mouse updates and the BIOS
updates all do certain things but
usually it's maintaining compatibility
for new memory modules
sometimes fixing minor issues with
overclocking sometimes just stability
updating the aji set its the AMD CPU
micro micro code and that can actually
help improve performance too so so I
want to make sure that we have the most
up-to-date version of this and the
current version is f-22 which was
launched on March 16th updating that GC
and actually if I jump over to the
actual system here and I pull up CPU Z
if you're not sure what's version of
BIOS your mother mother work currently
has just pull up CPU Z go to mainboard
and you can see it right here we're on
f-22 B which is a variance of the f-22
that they've actually launched this
might the bee might mean it's a beta
BIOS this was from February 13th so so
I'm gonna go ahead and update just to be
on the safe side and make sure that
we're ready for our newest processor so
I'm gonna click download from America
and it has downloaded and I'm going to
copy that over to a USB Drive so I have
my USB Drive plugged in it's just a
little four gig drive it helps if it's
formatted fat32 and my experience but in
here we can see a couple different files
we actually don't need those we just
need two f-22 file here the actual BIOS
itself I'm just gonna copy it over to
this drive bada-bing and then we will
restart the system and of course it has
Windows updates to do all right now the
windows updates have finished and it is
restarting I'm gonna tap the delete
button as it is booting you can see the
quick boot menu that pops up down at the
bottom and that will allow me to get
into the BIOS and the BIOS we mentioned
a little bit in the second video in this
series so jump back there if you want to
know a little bit more details but
here's what I'm gonna do to prepare the
BIOS for these upgrades first thing I'm
actually going to do is go into my
memory settings if you remember before
we did
plug in XMP settings or you may have
plugged in XMP settings right now you
can see they're disabled but if you have
those enables because I'm going to be
updating the memory go ahead and disable
that you want the memory running at the
default low speed and you don't want
your new memory to automatically boot up
with XMP settings before you can at
least go in there and set them
yourselves I'll just make sure you don't
try to boot and get a boot failure or
something like that and have to swap
everything back in so memory setting
back to defaults another thing that you
can do here if you don't want to do that
is just go to load optimise defaults
there and that will load optimize
defaults including default memory speeds
beyond that though we want to of course
update that bios and at least in the
gigabyte UEFI you want to use the mouse
go down here to the bottom and over to
queue flash and then here we can see
updates you can also use this to backup
your current bios version if you really
want to do that now it automatically
chose the drive and it automatically
selected that BIOS file that I
downloaded but you may need to browse to
find it directly once we've chosen that
we're just going to hit enter and it
verified it and then we click the button
and it'll go ahead and start updating
the BIOS again a BIOS update is not
something that you need to do all the
time it's something that you should do
if you're considering a system upgrade
or if you're considering say selling
this motherboard let's say you have an
old be 350 motherboard that you're
trying to sell or something like that
you want to make sure it's up to date
for the new processors so this is
something I'd recommend doing before you
sell that that way you make sure that if
you sell an old be 350 motherboard or X
370 motherboard from last year to
somebody who's going to be updating this
year but the Rison to set up because
there are going to people be people who
get rise into CPUs but still are trying
to save money by using a 300 series
motherboard it'll make sure that they're
able to install and get up and running
and they won't be calling you back and
asking you why you say why you sold them
a motherboard that doesn't work so just
take a minute or two and then we will
you reboot so after the BIOS update
finished we did a restarts and then the
windows update finished I'm probably
going to get questions in the comment
section for this video asking whether it
was smart to do the BIOS update in the
middle of a Windows Update I've never
had an issue with that in the past but
if you want to be on the safe side it's
probably best to do your Windows updates
then do the BIOS update one than the
other but it worked just fine for me in
case you were wondering so just running
cpu-z here and I can see if I go over to
the motherboard the BIOS version is
updated we're on f-22 rather than f-22 B
now with the updated date and then also
if I jump over to memory we can see that
the memory speed has dropped back to the
default which is 20 133 or basically two
times this current speed
of 1066 so we're good there too so now
let's take another look at what our
upgrades are actually going to be I
already mentioned the upgraded processor
of course that's going to give us a lot
more processing power very very handy if
you were for example been playing games
on your system but maybe you want a game
and stream it at the same time the six
core AMD Rison processors have been
great for that the 1600 and 1600 X and
of course the 2600 and 2600
falling up with roughly the same specs
but they're gonna run at a higher
frequency which is pretty cool now
because we're switching from a processor
that has graphics built in to a
processor that doesn't have graphics
built in we're gonna need a graphics
card but the other big thing that I
would definitely upgrade or consider one
to be one of the first upgrades of the
system is memory memory is the other
thing that's really expensive right now
prices haven't going to come down to
much so we're looking at something
that's gonna hit your wallet right now I
have a 2 by 4 gig kit installed so that
gives 8 gigs total but this is also a
mini ITX motherboard it's very small so
there's only 2 slots so if we're
updating our memory we're gonna actually
want to take out our to four gigs sticks
and replace them with two 8 gig sticks
to give us 16 gigabytes total and also
maintains our dual channel compatibility
because we want to use the same two
exact sticks of memory in order to run
them at the exact same speed now the kid
I'm gonna be using today is this trident
z RGB kit from g.skill i'm using this
because it's one of the kits that's just
been universally compatible with all the
rising processors that i've used it is a
3200 speed kit and 2 8 gig sticks makes
16 gigs so it's also got fancy RGB s on
the top so we're gonna light up the case
a little bit more and make it fancier
that way but if you don't want to spend
the money on that kit because it tends
to be a bit more expensive than other
kits that are of comparable speed but
maybe not quite as blingy you want to go
back to your motherboards support page
and actually go over to the support list
now these are PDFs so they're going to
download really quickly but we have
memory support lists here they're
specifically actually saying pinnacle
ridge support versus Raven Ridge and 7th
gen so pinnacle Ridge is the newest one
that's probably the list that we're
going to want to download but of course
if you're looking for compatibility with
say a 2,200 year 24
then look at this raven ruthless i'm
guessing they're only validating kits
that they have been specifically able to
test with these new rise in 2000 series
processors well let's take a look at
what they've come up with this is just a
big spreadsheet every one of these from
different manufacturers is going to look
a little bit different but basically
they're separated by memory speed here
we can see the memory manufacturer we
can see the density of the dims we can
see whether it's dual rank or single
rank as far as where the actual memory
chips are on one side of the PCB or both
sides of the PCB from the memory and
then we can see if they've tested in one
or two memory sockets and whether
they've validated the XMP settings so
what I would do here is look down in the
3200 megahertz range check that list out
just look at the kits that are of the
capacity that you're looking for make
sure that XMP has been verified and then
of course highlights these product names
search and see if you can find them for
sale in your area it does take a little
bit of hunting work to get these
specific kits working with your
motherboard but that's part of the
reason why I chose that team kit for
this original build was because it was
readily available at Newegg works just
fine with the XMP settings in this board
and this is the same case for the kit
we're gonna be using right now so we are
almost ready to start upgrading the last
thing we need is that graphics card we
know our CPU we know our memory graphics
card is next and graphics cards are very
expensive I'm gonna be looking at
desktop desktop graphics cards just over
on the Newegg website I like choosing
the Newegg radio button so I see only
stuff that's being sold directly by them
and I browse through this a little bit
guys and let me just tell you that the
Radeon rx 500 series like a rx 570 or
580 are very good cards they're about
$100 more than their MSRP right now
about the same goes for the GTX 1060 you
can get those in the 300 to 350 dollar
range right now still pretty pricey when
you consider that they're supposed to be
200 to 250 dollars for my money right
now if you really have to buy a graphics
card and you can't wait any longer
the GTX 1050 Ti is a solid performer
especially if you're playing at 1920 by
1080 and if I start by lowest-price here
we can see that you can actually
get one for 194 dollars 195 might seem
like a reasonable deal for this but bear
in mind that the MSRP is a hundred and
forty for this card so you're still
spending about fifty fifty-five dollars
more than MSRP but it's a big jump up
from the integrated graphics that you
get with the 2,200 G or even a 2400 G
and it sort of pushes you down the road
towards getting a much higher end system
and since you have to have a graphics
card to go along with the new processor
since the new processor doesn't have
graphics this is kind of the most viable
solution in my book for right now all
right guys I've relocated over to my
work table I've got a Phillips head
screwdriver and a rubber mats to work on
and of course my upgrading items the 27
sorry 2600 X I'm gonna use the included
Wraith spire cooler that comes with the
2600 X for now I was actually going to
potentially do an upgrading to the
cooling as well today but there is a
hundred and forty millimeter height
limitation for coolers on this case and
the coolers I had around were a little
bit too tall so perhaps we'll follow up
with that and a new video of course that
g-scale trident z r gb memory kid
already mentioned 3200 speed 2 by 8 gig
and then an msi geforce gtx 1050 Ti
so just pull all the new parts out of
the boxes and I wanted to make a quick
note about the graphics card since we're
using a 1050 Ti there is no extra power
needed on this graphics card but that
will not always be the case
and since you may be he had an extra 100
bucks to spend or something and maybe
update it to attend 60 then I wanted to
point this out many graphics cards like
this Vega 56 have supplemental power
required usually this is in the form of
either a 6 pin or an 8 pin extra power
plug so you can see this one is a 6 and
then it breaks off an extra 2 if it
needs all eight if you have a graphics
card that requires that extra power then
you'll want to make sure to grab that
extra cable either that's affixed to
your power supply if you have a power
supply that has all the cables attached
or you might need to grab an extra
modular cable that should have come with
it like this then you can wrap that up
and make sure that your power is plugged
in should only be able to plug in one
way and the only other thing to note
about these extra 8 and 6 pin power
connectors is that try not to get them
confused with the CPU supplemental power
that can be an 8 pin plug but that's 2
blocks of 4 rather than 6 and 1 all
right so here's our trusty original
builds and I was actually going to pull
the motherboard out next but what I've
realized is that thanks to how this case
is designed I think I can actually get
away without doing that so I'm gonna
remove this top piece because the top
piece on this case can be removed just
in the same exact way as the side panels
let's just get down in at the top which
is where we need to be if we're gonna be
removing our heat sink fan as well as
the CPU now if you're planning to update
or upgrade your CPU cooler then this is
probably something where you want to
pull the motherboard out out as well you
need to remove those 4 Phillips head
screws to hold it down and then you can
unplug all those motherboard connectors
and pretty much just leave them where
they are and that way you'll be able to
just kind of plug them back in but again
since we're trying to kind of work
around our existing Hardware here I am
just going to remove the memory by
removing those two little catches on the
one side and
not one at a time that was easy enough
and then of course next is the CPU which
has its original CPU cooler on it simply
held down by four corners four screws on
the four corners I'm going to start by
going to opposite corners and unscrewing
each screw just a couple turns a couple
of rotations again in the similar way to
mounting the CPU cooler on to the CPU
originally we just don't want to get one
corner cinch down too tight while the
other other corners are not so we want
to loosen it in a uniform fashion around
each corner once you get and got it
backed off a little bit you can just go
ahead and unscrew the rest now you get
to experience a quirky unique traits of
these AMD CPU coolers which is that when
they ship you the AMD CPU cooler in the
box very handy to get this in the box
and this is a pretty solid cooler as
well it has thermal paste pre applied
and that's what I used when I first
installed this the thermal paste has a
bit of a reputation for having a
glue-like quality to it when you're
removing the CPU or the cooler so I got
lucky there see I was able to kind of
wiggle it and slide it a little bit off
to the side it also helps that this
system was up and running five or ten
minutes ago that means that the thermal
paste is going to be a little warm if
you happen to have thermal paste that
just doesn't want to give it doesn't
want to budge you might have a situation
where you actually yank the CPU out of
the socket along with the cooler when
you're pulling it out don't worry when
that happens you should flip it over and
double-check your pins on the bottom if
you're pulling it straight up out of the
socket it should it should allow it to
pull it up even if that little arm is
closed but you do want to double check
here and make sure that all the pins are
still straight and everything and then
of course since you're going to want to
probably sell this old CPU you got this
2200 G just recently for $99 right you
could probably sell it for 80 bucks
still give or take you're gonna want to
do that you're also gonna want to do the
same thing with your memory right now
your original little two by four gig kit
of memory throw those up on eBay or
Craigslist or wherever you can safely
sell them to a friend or a neighbor get
some cash back from that original
hardware and you can apply that to
towards your new upgrades
so amazing to clean the CPU here is a
product from Arctic clean which is
called thermal surface thermal material
remover and surface purifier this is
actually a two-step process
one fluid to remove most of the stuff
and then one more to go on there and
make everything pretty and clean
absolutely not necessary to use this
stuff but I will post a link to it in
the description if you guys don't have
this just go ahead and use some
isopropyl rubbing alcohol I've gone
ahead and cleaned off both the CPU and
the CPU cooler and again this is just
because I'm assuming you guys are gonna
want to make the most out of your old
hardware and resell it and if I was
selling an old 2200 G I would probably
want to sell it along with the cooler
so anyone got it could go ahead and get
set up and running and not need to worry
about getting a cooler as well so there
we go nice and clean and also just want
to double check those and then of course
if you kept the original packaging for
this box it back up or on Craigslist so
before I go ahead and drop the 2600 X in
I wanted to quickly compare the coolers
here's the Wraith stealth that came with
2200 G and here's the rates fire you'll
notice it is substantially taller so you
got more just mass here in the aluminum
hint thin array around the outside
there's also a copper slug at the center
and coppers a better conductor of heat
than aluminum is so having a copper
contact is very often the things done
with coolers if you want it to be a more
effective cooler so don't try to use
your stealth with your 2600 ex and just
wanted to also point out if you get the
2700 X the highest end actually comes
with the Wraith prism cooler which is
similar to this but they say it's even
better at cooling and it also has RGB
LEDs so that's something you can do now
thankfully with everything removed here
is this actually gonna be a really
simple upgrade from this point forward
so if the gold triangle is lined up
properly it will drop right in just just
like I just did that's a zero insertion
force sake
and I have zero insertion force team
shirts on my store check out the store
in the link in the description alright
CPUs installed with the lever arm
dropped and now I can go ahead and take
our cooler stick that in right on top
again thermal paste is pre applied here
if it wasn't if I had no thermal
material I want to get some thermal
paste and put a blob right dead center
on that CPU but we're not doing that for
right now so I'm just going to attach
this
okay guys file this under problems I
wouldn't have if I wasn't trying to do
this with the motherboard in place there
is a backplate you guys remember behinds
the am4 socket and that's basically
falling down it's just it's just
dropping down a little bit so the
threading that I need to get this little
screw into is dropping so all I've done
is taken a plastic just a knife here and
I'm kind of sliding it under there just
to prop it up enough just to prop it up
enough that I can get that threaded on
and again this is really just because
I'm being lazy and not removing the
motherboard but if you guys are doing
this exact build then you might be you
might need to do something like this but
improvisation it's always fun
our memory also goes in the same way as
before just lining up the notch and
pressure straight down and finally we
are going to install the graphics card
so for that we got a couple expansion
slots here in the back there's a
protective little plastic piece and then
beneath that just a couple more Phillips
head screws that are holding on our two
PCI Express expansion slot covers we do
need to remove both of these
and then from here we'll just take our
graphics card in PCI Express slot is
along the bottom and that of course
lines up with the PCI Express slot on
the motherboard it's one notch on one
end of it so pretty tough to get this in
backwards or anything we do need to push
some of our cables to the side here from
where we ratted them when the original
build was was done there is a little
notch here along the bottom of the
graphics card which is just kind of
there incidentally but I find it's a
convenient place to route through cables
like the HD audio cable we have right
here and once it's slotted into the
motherboard we can secure it on top with
those two screws
moved back over here to the desk where I
have monitors and stuff I have plugged
the system back in but it's not powered
back on yet I do want to point out that
the video outs on the motherboard which
were previously usable with our 2200 G
now are no longer usable because there
is no graphics no I GPU that's part of
our new 2600 X CPU about 2200 G and our
memory we are setting aside for selling
to apply towards the cost of the system
I'm gonna flip the power switch in the
back on the power supply and then I'm
gonna hit the power button and the
system spins up and that's always a good
thing we have initial power so we did
boot up but it actually booted all the
way into Windows which is good it means
things are working new graphics device
so it did reset to default resolution of
all 1280 by 720 is the best we can do
right now we are going to need to
install a driver for a new graphics card
so we would get that from Nvidia can
download the latest one I'm not going to
go through that but I do want to double
check that everything else is running at
the right speed so you're probably
pretty familiar with the BIOS by now but
I've done the same thing to get into it
before by tapping the delete button as a
system was booting up it's letting me
know that it's done an automatic BIOS
reset so we did that kind of
preemptively beforehand but often times
the best will do that when it recognizes
new hardware but here we can go in and
for instance over on the right we can
see our CPU we're not at 3.6 gigahertz
and then if we go up here to motherboard
intelligent stuff I always forget how
how gigabyte labels things but here we
can get back into the same stuff that we
got back into before such as what's CPU
is running at and that's CPU for
settings you know it would be nice if
gigabyte did it would is just tell us
right from the get-go what's installed
so even though even though I'm not being
told directly what CPU is installed
that's just part of gigabytes choice for
their UI here I can't at least go to my
advanced memory settings and I'm just
going to switch to profile 1 for X and P
mode so they'll get my memory running at
its rated speed of 30 200 megahertz
that's pretty much all I'm going to do
here as mentioned everything else it was
probably going to be within the
operating system so let's save and exit
and the last thing I'm going to do
hopefully is run cpu-z the updated
version of cpu-z so it actually
recognizes my processor we got the risin
5 2600 X right there properly listed TDP
I'm not going to go into the speeds
right now because I'm not supposed to
show you guys that yet but we can also
see over here with our updated BIOS
everything's recognized properly and we
can even look at our memory and see that
the memory speed has taken we're at
about 1600 megahertz which equals 32
mega 3200 megahertz double data rate and
that means we're good to go the
installed updated software is pretty
much ready the final thing of course
would be to download and installed that
Nvidia driver for the graphics card and
then we could get back to gaming or
maybe try setting up like OBS or xsplit
to do gaming and streaming at the same
time there's so many things you can do
now that this system has gone from being
a pretty entry-level quad core with
integrated graphics to a 6 quartz well
thread CPU a discreet graphics card with
a pretty decent amount of horsepower and
overall a much more powerful system with
16 gigs of system memory alright guys
that is all for this video the upgrade
of the originally $500 build now it's
more of like a 750 or $800 booth I've
actually have not added up all the cost
of the parts in here because you know
you sold some parts you bought some new
parts it's hard to keep track of but I
will get a list of all the parts in here
and I'll put it down in the video's
description as well some other helpful
links to my original how to build video
as well as my first 5 things to do with
a new PC build video which if you have
not gotten a new PC set up before should
be very helpful with getting Windows 10
installed driver updates and all that
good stuff but guys thank you so much
for watching this video hit the thumbs
up button on your way out if it helps
you out at all and share it with your
friends if you know anyone who's
interested in building a gaming PC
anytime soon thanks again and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
