cool I just tweeted hi everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware it's a live
show
discuss technology computers lots of fun
stuff but remember Tuesday evening at
5:30 p.m. Pacific time on twitch.tv
slash awesome hardware as well as to our
YouTube channels mine is Paul's hardware
that's where the first half of today's
episode is being streamed to this is
episode number 190 side a right now and
30-40 minutes we'll switch to Kyle's
channel which is side B that's like the
description as well as links to the
stories and articles and stuff we're
going to talk about today you're not
wrong pocket not get real real good real
hard-hitting cup of quick words of
warning before I begin the show we do
enjoy an adult beverage typically beer
feel free to join us if you're of age
please drink responsibly and we also
occasionally use a belt language on the
show mother clucker as Kyle is
demonstrating right now so keep an ear
out for that I think you've been warned
and we can proceed with selling stuff
yes she's also what we do at the
beginning of the show if you guys would
like to help support our channels check
out my store Paul's hardware net wide
variety of high quality merchandise
awaits your perusal perusal purchasing
needs that are real web hoodies mugs
pint glasses
yes perusal I like that words nothing
wrong should be used more often
yeah pretty peruse the where's captain
thumbscrew still still they're still
super nice thanks to all you guys who
order during the show we'll give you a
shout out towards the end if you wanna
check out the Kyle store it's bit wit
tech slash store yes there's a new screw
with confidence shirts as well as other
high quality high quality merch where
you tell is wearing it right now I
really like the olive color I don't know
if I have one of those
I think I've fuckin dirty you have both
yeah and you have both too because I do
it because they were sent to me and my
olive one went I need to find it it's
nice because I usually wear black it's
nice to switch it up to something
yeah it's good to have some color in
your life yeah remind you that you know
there's there's warmth of Joey to the
world outside spaces good Stefan all
right since it looks like everything is
going well so far
also big shout out to our moderator cell
sub-process oh he's there in chat so I
tried to find the section for disabling
links in chat because that was a problem
last week but I couldn't find it it
looks like you can disable comments in
live chat altogether but there was no
option for link disabling unless I
completely missed it but I think you
have to do that when you setup the live
stream possibly I yeah I looked in those
settings to like in the event settings
of in Locarno so she said maybe there's
a link that could lead you to that okay
all right let's talk about tech news
wait I'm supposed to click this thing ah
why would that go there any news or
thirds all right professional all right
starting off with a bit more information
that has come out about in videos RTX
super Oh super you guys might have heard
a little bit about super around copy
text that week because that's when they
first put out that video where it was
like a shiny logo that said super and
g-force and everyone was like mysterious
in video what do you what are you doing
I haven't followed any of this so I knew
have it know so I'm actually very
excited well it kind of makes it kind of
makes sense because honestly it was like
there's there's not really much
substance to it it was a it was a big
tease and a lot of people thought in
video was doing that to just sort of
suck some of the wind out of AMD sales
with their Radeon announcements and
their Navi stuff and I you know that
probably is the case but there is
something called NVIDIA super at least
according to these leaks I mean
according to a video this article of
course or video and now we have this
chart here this is an overclocked 3d net
article showing actual listings for
these super cards RTX 2080 super 2070
super
and 2060 super bear in mind all the
since early information has not been
verified or confirmed by Nvidia so it
could all be bunk but the information as
to the launch dates that they're talking
about which is a super series of cards
in mid-july came from video cards and
then here are wallet check shown right
there sporting it just a very snappy
pink shirt that looks like he was
rocking it he came out with some of
these some of these specs that are
listed here so we're looking at a mid
July launch would be just after the
Radeon Navi series the new rx 50 750 700
xt launch these specs indicates that the
cards are slightly juiced versions of
the existing our TX 2060 2070 and 2080
the biggest difference here is going to
be your 2060 super down down at the
lower ends no price listed here of
course but it's jumping from 6 gigs to 8
gigs of memory the the existing are TX
2060 has 6 gigs now we have 8 gigs there
beyond that we're looking at about 128
to 256 more cuda cores depending on
which version you're looking at the
2080s super looks like it's going to sit
between the existing r-tx 20 80 and the
20 80 TI there doesn't appear to be an
Archie X 20 80 TI super and honestly
beginning to the point where in video is
just having too many little supplemental
names to add on yeah like at the end
like for instance I guess they couldn't
have made a 20 80 TI there you had that
but it could be the 2070 TI and 2060 TI
right yeah what they throw on super in
there I guess super its Super T is old
news man yeah super one fraud with the
Nvidia marketing team said to Jensen we
gotta go super I guess super so think
what you may or think about the them
calling it super but it does seem like
they're having a bit of a refresh for
the RT X series and probably rumor has
it that Nvidia plans to reveal their
r-tx super series of graphics cards
within the next two weeks according to
this article wince dental I think not
articles from the
it is now the 18th that seems a little
little short if it's gonna be after the
Navi launch because the Navi launch is
the seventh
what's short the well the article says
within two weeks but that would still be
in June yeah if it was two weeks from
when the article was posted all right so
anyway we still don't know for sure but
feel free to check the article out if
you want to look a little bit more
specifically at some of those specs it's
not just the coot of course there is
also a boost in the memory speed it
looks like some of the models that were
using slower ddr2 ddr3 GD are six from
fourteen or at least the the the
bandwidth yeah right yeah
oh because the interface I'm sorry faces
interface interface for the 2060 went
from 192 bit to 256 because they're
adding more memory modules so you
haven't an additional memory controller
and that means that the bandwidth went
from 336 to 448 also with the 2080 the
memory speed went up to 16 Giga bits per
second told you need er 6 though but
anyway so that's where you get your 448
gigabytes per second to 512 so a bit
more memory bandwidth there it makes
sense it makes sense up the only cannoli
card whose capacity memory capacity was
bumped up was the RFC X 2016 because
because now at eight gigs it'll rival
the the rx 550 700 series yes so an
Nvidia I think would much rather be able
to say like here's our card and it's
better than their card and not have to
make some excuse like well your card
only has six gigs of ram later size 8
gigs or leading aimday with no cards to
play they've gotten tired of doing that
with the existing with like the 1060 and
me and the RX 5 580 inch yeah they
played that out that's been around for a
while and this will done some credence
to some of the stuff that AMD said in
the past week or two which is that
they've specifically are targeting the
RX 50 750 700 xt @ 1440p gaming 2560 by
1440 and that six gigs of ram is made
a little cutting it a little slim for
14:40 gaming yet
AMD said that if this is true it would
seem like nvidia agrees at least to some
extent maybe I maybe I'm putting too
many words in their mouth but I think
that makes them sense and also just for
the for the spec sheet when you're doing
comparative right
comparisons of the cards of course
without the way to see what the
frequency is that they're running at our
you know hopefully there'll be some
clock speed boosts there too it'll be
interesting to see if there will be
significant clock speed boosts it's not
listed in this article here but I think
in the original video cards article they
list the actual GPU names because each
GPU has like as a different little skew
and they do that they do have an updated
name on there I don't know if they just
did that for the for the to
differentiate the chips or if there's
any significant difference in the
manufacturing process freedom chips for
these at all or refund rates or
something like that yeah so a lot of
stir remains to be seen but hopefully
we'll find out soon and if you bought a
2070 or 2080 or 2060 you're a sucker
because there's better ones coming up
I'm just kidding none of that that was
always the case for anyone who buys any
computer parts yeah all right as I move
on to this this actually is from a
couple weeks ago the original articles
from the end of May so it's been out for
a couple weeks but week we didn't really
talk about it too much and there's a
little bit of an update going on here
but this is about some user benchmarking
Geekbench benchmarks they have online
databases and the benchmarks were
uploaded to them that were sourced from
Rison 536 hundreds that being third-gen
rise in parts is n2 based some of the
chips that were expecting to come out
well that we're pretty sure coming out
and you know July 7th I make big Liars
of AMD a thing if they go back on that
at this point the 3600 is the lowest end
in the stack at $200 has four point two
years boost clock 3.6 gigahertz base
just a 65 watt TDP so I'm expecting this
to be a pretty popular chip because yeah
price right so your buck
and everything these numbers were
sourced from to mapa stack we've talked
about his his database numbers before
because he likes to he likes to dig into
the benchmark databases from sources
like this and find numbers that were
uploaded by people who have the chips
already theoretically and didn't unplug
their internet when they were running
these benchmarks so the benchmarks got
automatically uploaded of course again
this is really information could be all
bollocks but we'll find out
we'll find out soon two sets of scores
just a couple for each one the first one
here is from user benchmark and you can
see they give an overall score as a
percentage there's different
configurations I believe for the for the
different setups here but it's scored a
hundred and seven percent on this upper
score which according to the article
would put it on par with an i7 8700 K or
an AMD Rison thread Ripper 1950 X pretty
good numbers if these new CPUs from AMD
are getting are getting are if they're
nudging up against the current IPC
performance the current single core
performance of what what in socre
already has like within eighty six
hundred k 8700 a that sort of thing then
that's a pretty big indicator that AMD
has done a lot of ketchup
with the ketchup with with the new micro
architecture design as well as the
process shrink down to seven nanometers
and it would indicate that you know
hopefully that that's gonna mean better
gaming performance and and so on
the clock speeds are a lot higher this
time around to clock speeds are
definitely boosted up as well and be
able to get higher on on six cores than
you will on yeah sixteen for sure yeah I
hope so
I mean even if it's like just a couple
cores on the higher core count ones that
can at the faster frequency second tests
were from Geekbench this was run on an
Asus tough gaming x5 70-plus motherboard
squared 5390 points single core 2600 and
so I'm sorry 26,000 third and 71 on the
multi-core
there's also link there was a discussion
on the latest tech tips about this and
they posted a link to a geek bench I 580
600 benchmark score so you can look at
the single score single core score there
which is about 5,700 about 5,400 it
looks like at least in this comparison
the 80 600 K is running a little bit
faster you have to bear in mind that
with these summaries they don't always
show the frequency so that's something
that you kind of have to keep in mind
mister Epis AK though we hate where you
go there you go mr. haversack where's
your link to whether it is anyway here's
his Twitter he is continually posting
things so Heaney actually just within
the past 24 hours posted this which you
might be able to see it's a 3,800 and
yeah 3800 X which is an 8 core the
higher end 8 core that's gonna run at a
faster speed single core score they're a
bit higher but not too much at 5400 6
still slower than the multi-core score
of 34,000 oh by the way I didn't show
the multi course so this is 8600
multi-core score of 22,000 this is the
nice 3,600 26,000 so you know similar to
what we've been seeing with rise in 1st
and 2nd gen even if you're seeing a
little bit of a drop-off in single core
that multi-core score for anything
you're doing you know I think the most
practical use is like video encoding or
something like that you know you're
getting a lot more a lot more juice
there
multi-core score for the 3800 X 34,000
59 which is up there with with you know
some of the higher end desktop scores of
course you know it the tests vary
depending on settings and everything
like that and you can't determine all of
that from the reports here but oh
actually though I did want to show that
the link for the 3,800 X did show the
frequency it was running at base of 3.9
in a max frequency of four point four
seven gigahertz not that I'm surprised
that the multi-core scores for these res
and 3000
processors have been like quite a bit
higher like notably higher than last gen
because I was expecting a need to
definitely work on their single core
performance to catch up with Intel
because that's sort of been their their
weak point in that area but it seems
like they've optimized for for
multi-core performance as well and you
know all this stuff that they have you
know talked about for how they've like
limited a lot of workload to a single
CCX instead of like transmitting data
between them to reduce latency further
yes does a Windows Update yeah yeah
those windows update as well but I feel
like that's that's kind of cool they're
very attacking multiple fronts yes I
mean if you can if you can figure that
they're taking a single core performance
and increasing it this much then you
take that and multiply it by 16 threads
or more if you're going for the twelve
or sixteen talking about the 12 or 16
cores right it's going to it's gonna add
up yeah while reducing latency between
between chords as well it's it's pretty
cool nice it's a cool like I said early
number just unverified but exciting
nonetheless so I'm excited I got
together a few more weeks
July 7th again is when the launch is
although I believe pre-orders go up July
1st but don't pre-order stuff it's bad
don't do it bad to do wait for the
videos next up
cryptocurrency good one gasps no I
haven't heard about cryptocurrency I've
talked about cryptocurrency much since
kind of the bubble burst and GPU mining
sort of became unpopular it is a hot
again now Paul sure now let's dive in
this is a facebook cryptocurrency it's
called Libre and I just thought it was
somewhat interesting deeper so I'm going
to go over it TechCrunch article here is
very long if you guys really are
interested this I encourage you to read
it because I'll be perfectly honest I
did not get through the whole thing I
was crunching Chetty it's stuff ready
for the show and there's more to be said
about this but from a high level
perspective this this new cryptocurrency
called Libre will let you buy things or
send money to people with nearly zero
fees according to Facebook
so you can buy or cash out your Libra
online or the local exchange points at
grocery stores you can spend it using
interoperable third-party walk apps or
Facebook's Calibra wallet that will be
built into whatsapp messenger as well as
the Facebook app what they released
today just today or was this yes this is
fifteen hours ago so yes this was today
what they released today was a white
paper which explains Libra and it's test
net they are working out kinks in the
blockchain system and they're expecting
a public launch of this in the first
half of 2020 I multiply about this
because on the one hand finding a good
use case for blockchain is a good thing
it is a useful technology and I think
there's problems with I think there's
problems with it what's with the
cryptocurrency bubbles in like 2013-2014
and in the past couple years but I think
finding a good way to use it that's sort
of more Universal I think will be
beneficial to people there's a lot of
stuff that it can replace when it comes
to fees and tracking of things however
if you look at the people who are behind
this Facebook we're not exactly the
biggest fans of Facebook around here
we've pointed out quite a few things
that we don't like about them they are
not completely in control of Libra
because Libra is there's actually a
governance board it's going to be
controlled by the founding members of
the Libra Association and that includes
at currently 28 different companies
although they say they're trying to
expand it to and when they want like a
hundred by the time it actually goes
they actually go go live with it this
thing includes like companies like uber
and lyft eBay Spotify you have Facebook
down here you got others such as visa
you have some independence what do we
got some venture capitalists like
andreessen horowitz breakthrough
initiatives capital companies
so you might look at these loose lists
of companies and you may or may not have
existing opinions about some of them so
I don't know I think we can use Libra
through other apps besides Facebook yes
okay it is a it is a currency but there
is it but Facebook created pages
Facebook is one of the founding members
or there's one of the Libra Association
okay so there's lots of different
companies involved because Facebook
wants it to be universal I mean I think
I think their idea the their ideal goal
is to create a universal digital
currency that's international that you
can use anywhere that you know ideally
for the end user is like convenience and
doesn't have fees for transferring money
and moving stuff around Facebook and all
these companies get out of that is well
they can they can they can your data
mining they can see what's happening
with the money and where it's going yeah
you can they can they will also where to
go they they they basically will earn
interest on the money that's in there
mmm they'll earn interest on the money
that uses cash that users catch in
that's held in reserve so there'll be a
title money there that they'll her
interest on right looks like how venmo
makes money like there's no ads in venmo
but I think they just make money off of
interest and each each of the founding
members has paid a minimum of 10 million
dollars to join and then they will have
the option to become a validator a node
operator and again the article has more
technical details on this
I'm not going to delve into right now
because I'll probably get stuff wrong
but I didn't know that's that's the
thing this is that it's nada and we've
got a mining operation GPU money is not
involved so if that's what if that's
been your concern this whole time don't
worry this route this is not going to
suddenly be something that people are
mining Libre and buying Marty views for
or something like that so you can only
get it through spending real money and
converting it yeah
burn money and then you can transfer and
I imagine at a certain point they'll
have transfer rates that go up or down
or whatever but yeah again stuff on the
article talking about some of like the
inconsistency of the value of stuff like
Bitcoin for what they wanted to do so I
bring this up more as an FYI rather than
like I hope nobody tries to think I'm
saying like hey look a Libra it's
awesome or anything like that this is a
wait-and-see type of thing I personally
don't have a huge amount of trust in
Facebook or several of the other
companies involved here so I doubt I'm
gonna be jumping on it's starting to use
use this or anything yeah I guess that
kind of better wraps it up anyway let's
move on my credit card my Chase credit
card still works very well everywhere
that's good good mighty mighty dollar
oh I'm $80 okay sure Gizmodo article
here I have been poned is for sale gonna
bite you have I been poned have you used
I have have I been pwned
I know I haven't hit I've heard of this
yes it's a website founded by security
researcher Troy hunt in 2013 and it's
been around for for a while it's been
sort of a key player in certain hacks
mainly like hacks of existing companies
that have massive databases of user
information companies get hacked they
find that the user information is stored
with very poor security and now that
information you know is it's out there
somewhere hackers have it they're
probably gonna sell it and resell or
whatever you've been poned as a website
that has broken news about hacks of this
kind and it has a really cool thing
where you go on there and you punch your
email address in and it tells you if
your email address has been poned before
compromising anyways be compromised if
your email address was part of any of
these massive right Dave data breaches
that's handy
yeah handy in many ways doing the Lord's
work however Troy hence has been the
main
and doing the Lord's work in this way
and he's tired and maginot I imagine
he's got lots of other things before
Troy he has a statements he made a blog
post about this he said it's time to go
from that one guy doing what he can in
his available time to a better resourced
and better funded structure that's able
to do way more than what I could ever do
on its own on my own have I been poned
gets about a hundred and fifty thousand
unique visits on a typical day but that
can spike significantly they get ten
million unique visits on an abnormal day
such as when various collections of data
are dropped online that might for
instance collection number one back in
January that exposed seven hundred and
seventy three million emails and
twenty-one million passwords yeah so he
says he's getting burnt out and he needs
to hand this off I'm hoping that this is
acquired by a reputable company that
continues do you know doing this because
this is very good a lot of people you
need to know this like the key thing
about this is like your you might not be
hacked you your email or whatever other
accounts that you have might be just
fine
but the login information for those
might be out there might have been
released in in a previous hack and all
it takes is for the right person to
purchase that information and then feed
it to some botnets that start going and
testing for vulnerabilities and suddenly
you know if they realize it that they
have your actual log information yeah so
yeah it's a very useful tool if you guys
have never used it it is it is up and
running so feel free to go in and go
there and check your emails and what do
you think it's gonna sell Vito says that
it's been purchased by Windows Defender
that's not true no it doesn't say how
much he's selling it for I don't think
so all it says Troy said since he posted
his blog a few organizations have
reached out to him asking to be part of
the merger and act
in process that's that's all the article
says as far as that goes so cool
any all right don't tell it to Norton
it's alright
yes please no that's no semantics
alright that's all we got for the
general tech news we have another
segment here the ever-popular yes/no ah
love is yet another iteration of us
thinking you guys for information about
stuff yes no is a very simple very
straightforward though a very simple and
straightforward is we and we have a
thing we're gonna we're gonna rule yes
or no on it whether it should be or
should not be and that's pretty much a
hot-button topic zone yet fortunately
we're repeating stuff we've already
talked about a little bit so we can go
through stuff as we've done in segments
like this in the past we're going to run
through each thing first and then we'll
jump back to the first one to get your
feedback on it and there's truffle links
for each one so the first one we already
discussed Nvidia r-tx super we told you
guys the info about it at least that we
know or that we theoretically know so
we're judging this based on theory to
some extent and the question is just yes
or no what do you guys think
Nvidia super is this a good idea should
it be should it should it video go
forward with it
zoom in that that zoom job they're
pretty pretty straightforward there yes
it is our wonderful friend cell is
leaking the straw polls thanks tile in
chat so you guys can vote on that it's
really no room for gray areas in the
segment isn't it no that's why it's yes
no cuz there's no maybe it wouldn't be
yes no maybe yes maybe no yes that's why
I just know maybe so if you're not even
like a third cop-out answer or laughing
like that that's true because very
clear-cut
oh well that's funny what I have
subtitles on so it's doing automatic
subtitles I should just read linking the
straw polls Excel that it's really no
room for great areas
it's picking up pretty well it's usually
pretty good I'd love to see it on the
wild video see how that goes if we could
just repeat I could just keep reading
the subtitles from like 30 seconds ago
eventually it would cycle yeah catch up
yourself speaker reverberation or
something like that
all right next article here is from MIT
technology review actually the next two
articles are from MIT technology review
it's it's pretty much explained in this
image right here but there's also a
headline there's a new chip they've been
working on real-time robotics a start-up
in Boston and they have this new chip
that lets route robots quote-unquote
imagine their actions before they make a
movement so especially in industrial
situations where you have robots that
are doing things if you get in their way
most of the time they have no way of
knowing you're in their way or sensing
that or anything and they'll move right
through you so possibly to prevent
workplace injuries they're giving robots
sensory information so as you can see he
puts his arm out in front there and
instead of going through his armor
running into his arm the robot sees his
arm there maneuvers around it in order
to continue its job fancy so basically
we're giving robots the ability to sense
and you might think I like a first thing
you might think here's oh that's that's
a good thing however I will point out
that this is giving like one of the
things that humans have that that the
you know gives us an advantage
somewhere up here in the frontal cortex
we have like this simulation thing we
can imagine things before they happen we
can think like oh if I you know Jam this
into my eyeball and it'll hurt or
something like that so you can imagine
stuff we're giving robots that
capability will they use it for good or
for evil we don't really I mean are they
really imagining it or they just sent
detecting an object and going around it
is it just an algorithm it says imagine
in quotes Kyle that's a headless that's
a headline it's MIT technology review
they do yeah they're there for I know
cliff Bay when I see it or it takes a
quick better to know one and that's
that's pure quick Bay giving it is
fascination of ours to give robots human
properties like now they're imagining it
or they're thinking yeah not eventually
eventually and in some cases they
already do I guess you could argue but
these I think they're just they're just
program fortunately don't imagine it is
the night daydreams
it is the name sure about this of the s
no segment then we can completely ignore
that and make a summary judgment without
even having that information if you're
kind of like ignoring it I mean then you
cannot ignore it too you have the choice
all right you can do are we arguing this
for an hour no we don't not even like
anything we're just going to be seeing
where people think yes or no and we
could say our opinion still when we come
back to all imagine what it ain't
anything L imagine what my answer will
be sure you're about to be able to
imagine their actions before I make it
think was good let us know final hit
here MIT technology review kind of in
the same vein the world's best
supercomputers are being updated to run
AI software faster this is from the
international supercomputing conference
which kicked off in Frankfurt yesterday
they have a list of the 500 most
powerful super super computers u.s. is
still on top China has the most
computers on the US has the most
computing power with a hundred and
sixteen supercomputers China has more
supercomputers though with 219 anyway
that's kind of beside the point
hey I write artificial intelligence
terrifying Thinking Machines
supercomputers gene sequencers break
down the Strand in minutes does it talk
about that yeah they're doing software
optimizations here to make them better
at AI
gaining access to the supercomputers can
be a challenge because they're in high
demand however look like geospatial AI I
didn't get good notes on this article
stuff the speaker if you noticed I
missed 90% of everything you just said
that's fine on this shift computers be
able to do AI faster are like we're
giving them giving them more power I
guess it's kind of the same same
question we're deal
both in both of these circumstances like
how quickly do we want Skynet to happen
yeah do we want to accelerate that
eventual and we're talking I don't know
like AI sort of as a as a general
concepts artificial intelligence seems
like something that's other it's
separate from people and the computers
that are processing a I put too fine a
planet but like these are the most
powerful computers in the world we're
giving them the ability to think even
better this is what I'm saying
Skynet right that's the concern here
though anyway point being we're not
trying to get into details here should
this be a thing yes or no let us know
your opinion I want to get back to
getting answers for these things so
scared the segment scaring me back to
the most remote well that's that's the
whole idea but you got to face your
fears yeah no to everything I just want
to say null and everything okay we got
argue r-tx super right now right there
are you just kissing or just kissing
okay
people people already voted people have
their opinions let's say yes archaic
super your competitions don't for it I'm
stoked no not really I'm not stoked
but I'm just saying yes as in it's it's
a logical business move on invidious
part and they need to stay competitive
they're always one step ahead of you
know Kyle of course I I deep down I say
no internally I don't I don't think this
is great you're shooting yourself in the
foot then it's just gonna make you know
the products deck more confusing and
it's just a cash grab from it see now
now your yes opinion is starting to sway
people and yes just power gained another
percentage point our for sweetie 839 huh
dumpy I like these yes no because it's
so clear cut yeah and 61 percent of
people think that in video should not do
the Arizona turnip option all right
moving on should robot to be able to
imagine their actions before they make a
move big fat no on this house us no I'm
a fan that's fine because I wanted to
say yes nope nope I trust the robots at
least a little want robots with arms I
think they're kind of cute no you're
teaching them you're essentially
teaching them to dodge bullets so that
when we eventually need to
counter-attack them they'll be able to
just matrix neo that bullshit
because they're imagining the bullets
hitting them look guys right again even
strong even more strongly 70% it's I'm
rooting for the underdog which is myself
alright so we need to give robots the
ability to imagine stuff no I mean and
really life without an imagination is so
it's boring yeah
finally is it super computers be updated
to running a software faster yes or no
no Cal says no I'm gonna say yes here as
well I think the the yeah if the last
thing it gets yeah I'm gonna get smart
enough as long as we have like prime
directives in place that like humans
shouldn't die or be killed or or you
know should get massages and free
cheeseburgers I think it's okay you're
putting too much trust in the computers
and it'll they're probably do a better
job at figuring stuff I probably already
have you in there yeah they already lol
I was 3 for 3 here geez don't wear this
thing
you're all doomed so yeah we're just
we're ready to hand off control right so
no today no god that's exactly what we
don't just give in Kyle no that's not
that's it's just fine once you once
you've let go of yourself and your
desires and you realize that the
computers really I really know what's
best I have a suspicion that you you are
a robot but you're just one of them and
you're trying to coerce me into into
your little scheme whatever hive
mentality hive mind that that you guys
have laid out not guys but you droids
have playing fourth there's stuff that's
offensive see second not only a droid
would say that that's ridiculous Kyle
that sounds like something yeah right
we're here where's your CPU let me let
me take that out no no Kyle frightened
you have nothing to fear from us
all right let's say I wrap it there's a
wraps it up for my half of the show
thank you all so much for watching you
and promoting and all the good stuff we
have more stuff talking about on Kyle's
half and if you're watching on twitch
just stay right where you are if you're
watching on YouTube the link to house
half is down in the description thanks
again yeah watching yes kill all humans
