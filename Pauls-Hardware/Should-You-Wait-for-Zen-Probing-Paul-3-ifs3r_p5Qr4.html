hardware this is probing Paul episode
number three or at least the third of my
QA monthly videos that I'm doing so
every month I answer some questions that
you guys ask this month I will be
responding mostly to questions that were
asked in last month's video this is last
month's video where I showed the months
before that's video if I keep doing this
it will eventually like it'll go down to
near infinity I imagine depending how
many of these I do anyway thank for all
the feedback and and all that good stuff
in the last video appreciate that you
guys and I'm back to answer some more
questions so let's get right into it
starting off with this one
No that's the headline question but we
have one actually that was right before
that which is from Finn Jake and he said
would the cards you put on the Shelf get
dusty over the time this is this is
pretty straightforward he's talking
about the Shelf behind me the answer
would be yes they do but I have this
look it's a feather duster this is an
ostrich feather duster which means it's
very soft it looks best to you know
clean the desks out of it after use it I
got this because you know lots of stuff
back here and I need a quick and easy
way to clean it and a feather duster
just works great now granted if you have
a graphics card that's been in use for a
while it's gonna have dust kind of caked
up in there and on the fins but if it's
just sitting out you know you just kind
of go over the top give a little dusting
off and then you're good to go so that's
my solution for that anyway next
question here is from Sufyan con who
says is it worth waiting for AMD Zen or
should I get an Intel CPU for gaming
that's a very good question this is the
this is like the ultimate question the
eternal question should I buy new
hardware now should I wait to upgrade in
the future and there's no direct answer
for it what I would ask you to answer
this question for yourself is do you
have a computer that you're using right
now for gaming if gaming is what you
want to do and is it living up to your
expectations is it possible you know
there's a lot of times a system can get
to three years old and it can still do
everything that a brand new system would
do but it just does it a little bit
slower so it all depends on how patient
you are I guess to some degree how
accepting you are of not having access
to the newer technology like and not to
these and nvme support and that kind of
thing depending on what system you're
current you currently using of course
and then you also have that
forward-looking potential or factor here
which is that a and B Xen is something
that we know is going to happen it
should happen this year at some point
we're expecting it in the second half of
the year so that's at least three months
but probably longer than that until we
actually see an actual AMD Xen CPU that
you can buy and install in a system so
you have that maybe time that's like
well you're gonna be waiting for months
so you're gonna be waiting until
December we don't really know an AMD
isn't necessarily the best at always
sticking to their release dates for
certain products like they just came out
with a Radeon Pro duo and that was
supposed to come out in December and
that was after being pushed back from
like q3 last year so Hardware schedules
can get pushed back waiting can be
frustrating so all that taken into
consideration it's obviously gonna be up
to you whether or not you should invest
or not but hey if you can't live with
the system you have right now then just
upgrade just upgrade and tell yourself
you know it in three six months
this is gonna be supplanted by something
else that's newer and faster but hey
that always happens that will not not
happen regardless of what you buy so if
you can sort of tell yourself that and
live with it then it will give you a
little bit more confidence to go ahead
and buy right now that said and I know
this is another future looking thing
Intel should be launching cabie lake or
kb lake in june we're expecting that in
June so that's another I guess factor
the throw in there to make this in even
more confusing decision for you next
question here is from Ray Marlin RT and
sorry these are all pixelated I just
screen captain what kind of camera to
use a good question I've answered this
once or twice before but the first
answer would be the Panasonic Lumix gh4
DMC gh4 this is it right here the prices
come down a little bit but if you buy it
new you can get it for about $1,300 I
just really like this camera because
it's got features specifically for video
that are really nice like the flip out
screen so you can flip around and be
able to see yourself it's got like an
audio jack input which is just something
that you really need it's got an HDMI
out I'm using that to record right now
so it's got a clean HDMI out
accepted by lots of different capture
cards so you can use it to record
directly which is super helpful I've
actually just ordered a new one of these
I'm gonna have two of them to assist
with my workflow and specifically for
doing live streams I wanted to have a
better image quality of the live streams
all around and my other camera that I
used right now which I swear to God I
brought out here now is completely
disappeared I'm blind it's right here
okay this is my lumix Alex 100 which
actually has also has a micro 4/3 sensor
and really nice it's a fixed lens but it
is a very nice compound lens it does
really nice close-ups and I would just
use this for what I bought the second
gh4 from but what these camera companies
seem to like doing is they take their
kind of prosumer level point-and-shoots
that are kind of like this that cost 800
to a thousand dollars and they cut out
to like really really important features
that video production people would want
one is that discrete audio jack in so
you can do a audio from a different
source besides the built-in speakers and
then the second thing granted you can do
audio from a different source you just
have to sync it up later in post but
that's annoying the second thing is that
clean HDMI out I thought this was gonna
have it originally when I got it but
that HD I'm out on this is only for
watching recorded movies to be played
back which is all of completely useless
for me so for that reason I got another
gh4
I'm looking forward to it arriving soon
I got it on eBay for nine nine hundred
and forty dollars I think yeah I got it
used I was okay with that alright here
we go next question this one is from
Adam Ricard he's asking do you have
giveaways basically besides reviews and
the answer here would be yes yes I do
here's a bunch of giveaways I searched
my channel for giveaways so I wanted to
point out this one and particularly the
one that's right at the top because
we're doing another one just like this
next month in April but I've done like I
did a hundred thousand dollar giveaway
where I gave away a full computer I mean
hundred thousand subscriber giveaway not
a hundred thousand dollars and then I
also gave away for two hundred thousand
subscribers I gave away a gtx 980 yeah
I've done some giveaways I don't like to
do them all the time but yeah again
we're doing a really really similar one
to this one coming up in about a month
it is the same people it's me Kyle Jay
and hardware connects Dimitri and yeah
it's gonna be great you can
dollarz you wanted to find an OS and
some other stuff too I hope I'm not
spoiling it by tell you guys early but
yeah it's a giveaway and that'll be in
first or second week of April I think so
yeah another question here and this
one's sort of associated that's from
Sween 92 what's your recommendation for
an affordable microphone lab or Yeti
style for an aspiring content creator
well you actually pointed to one that I
would definitely recommend even though I
don't have one and use it personally it
which is a Yeti yetis are just they they
do a really good job plugs in via USB
really easy to use sits on the desk has
a pretty decent Stan built-in with some
isolation so you know you didn't get too
much noise if you bang on the desk or
that kind of thing
I use a few different audio solutions so
if you're a content creator obviously
you're gonna want maybe better audio for
a camera so this is a rode videomic this
is a video mic Pro I find this to be
very convenient to pop on top of a DSLR
plugs in if you have an eighth inch
audio input on your DSLR and this will
just give you much better audio and much
more directional audio because if you're
pointing it at your subject and your
subject within 5 to 12 15 feet in front
of the camera it'll pick them up really
nice its directional though you got to
point it at them and then you only have
the option of plugging in via this
little 8 inch jack so another option
well I'll show you guys what I'm using
right now and this is since I have two
of these this one would normally be up
there but I pulled it off this is
another mono priced product this is a
what is this this is their large
diaphragm condenser mic which if you
want to find it it's just six hundred
eight hundred six hundred eight hundred
is the model of this and this is nice
because it's XLR so I use this along
with a soundboard this does need power
but for 82 hundred bucks depending on
whether it's on sale or not the sound
you get on this is really quite nice I
mean I have a lot of echo in this room
and it still does a pretty good job I
have it like right here right right in
front of my face but just out of the
camera's reach this also gives you like
a shock mount and that kind of thing so
you need to drop 8200 bucks on this and
then you definitely need a sound board
since you need power for this so you're
probably gonna spend another 50 to 100 I
don't know how budgets are affordable
affordable you mean by by affordable so
that tends to vary depending on who you
are
the last thing I will I will show you
guys here is a audio solution that I
used for the first several years that I
was doing YouTube which is a zoom h1
this is about a hundred dollars and the
nice thing about this is it's portable
for one and it's also pretty versatile
so it's it's still a hundred bucks
apparently the price has not gone down
although I've seen it cheaper here and
there if you can find it on sale it's
got pretty nice built-in mics so as long
as you have it fairly close to your face
as you're talking that picks up pretty
good audio it's got built-in controls
here so you can turn the volume up and
down and all that good stuff battery
powered so double-a battery and that
lasts quite a long time with just a
single double-a can record directly to
the device itself via microSD cards it
has a microphone input so you could
connect it up to like a lav mic if you
have a right lav mic that doesn't need
phantom power you could plug it in here
and use this as a digital audio
recording device if you're not using the
microphones it's also got a line out so
you can use that to actually put some
headphones on and record what's going on
inside there and everything again it's
100 bucks and you get a lot of features
in here it's not like the best audio
quality but as long as you can keep it
pretty close to your face or the subject
or whatever you're talking to I find it
does a great great job I even got this
little this little bracket I don't even
live those shockmount
I got the shock mount as well which is
not made exactly for this but um this
allows you to even take it and use it
kind of like the same way that I would
with the rode videomic which is to mount
on top of a DSLR or something like that
and yeah speaking of microphones my mics
probably picking up a train rolling by
right now let's give it a second we'll
come back that was a kind of long-ass
train but hey it did go by faster than
when I had to wait for my computer to
update to Windows 10 which it did
automatically right before I started
recording my my my probe and Paul for
today isn't that fun also the dogs are
in the other room speaking of dogs wait
this is the wrong question next question
from where does the excellent in my
intros come from well I'm not going to
tell you guys directly but maybe someone
in chat knows and I will also say that
there's a big hint staring and staring
you right in the face right now until it
is I'll leave that and that's
that's my mystery alright another actual
tech question this is from Michael Webb
he's got a memory question he says he
has a skylight 6,700 kg1 gaming
motherboard sets from gigabyte and won't
let him use all four memory sticks he
says only to work he has eight gigs in
the machine so he's got a four by four
gig kits and it's a g.skill 3,200 Hertz
kits any ideas why it's only letting you
have two sticks work ok Michael uh just
a few things that you should check out
here one is there is a chance that your
motherboard is simply defective and that
one of your memory channels isn't
working properly two would be that your
motherboard is set to use XMP mode if
your motherboards is set to use XMP then
as you're booting up it's automatically
trying to run that memory at 3200 mega
transfers per second for a second to be
specific and it might not be able to do
that your processor might not be able to
do that your processor is where the
memory controller is and if it's memory
controller can't run at that speed then
you can't run that memory at that speed
so definitely try checking to make sure
you have XMP is on or off try running
the memory at the default speed for
skylake which would be 21 33 and then
maybe instead of enabling XMP try
ramping up from there and seeing if that
does it by and large you just need to
test everything that default speeds and
see if all four sticks are recognized if
it's not they're running at default
speeds and chances are you got a
motherboard problem maybe a CPU problem
but more likely the motherboard and what
you're really going to want to do is
find a repair shop or something like
that that you can bring the equipment
into so they can test each components
individually in working systems like the
CPU and a known working motherboard the
memory and a known working system just
to pinpoint exactly where you've got a
hardware failure if you are dealing with
a hardware failure and it's not just the
fact that your memory your CPU can't
handle that speed again 3200 mega mega
transfers per second for ddr4 is an
overclock speed until only actually
guarantees you'll be able to run that's
at what 21:33 is the default so yeah
moving along from Alex want is we have
that's Robo hazard by the way we have a
very important question I've
I've been asked this a lot and
thankfully yes I do have a peel box now
and here it is
I have only shared it with a couple
people so far and I'm sharing it with
you guys here on probing Paul here
towards the end of the show
peel box for three to five Diamond Bar
California so if you guys want to send
me anything that's legal to be sent
through u.s. mail and hopefully not like
huger useless make it be useful or at
least I don't know food no don't send
food unless it's fudge your might
beginning some fudge in the mail soon
okay let's move on to the last bit of
the show here which is going to be the
Twitter segment and I didn't ask for
questions on Twitter today I asked
people to come up with a cool backstory
for Heroes scar so here is our new
little dog I say little but that's not
true he's actually 85 pound mastiff
pitbull mix and he's got this he came
from the from shelter we we got him from
rescue shelter he's about 7 years old
and he has some pretty his ears are
cropped pretty pretty hurt heinous ly we
don't really approve of that but you
know he's he's amazingly cute super
friendly
he's got the scar on his snout right
here and it's very mysterious he looks
he looks like a real tough dog so I'm
just gonna go down the line here and see
what people had to say about this timmy
said fighting off a mob of ninja kittens
Zayn said an entire bushel of ninjas
were they ninja kittens I don't know
Paul says ninja cats so obviously
there's ninjas of some kind possibly the
feline variety involved here I got it
when the Fire Nation attacked from Mike
I think that's a that's a Last Airbender
reference I believe I'm not familiar
with sorry
here was a retired samurai dog he lost
his ears and got it got his scar after a
vicious sort of eeeh Slee he's alright
so he rose I mean it's a Japanese name
so I guess that's why we're getting the
ninja side of a shaving accident that's
a possibility breaking out of the crate
he did escape from his crate the other
day using his massive strength and then
he went and laid down on the couch
because he just wanted to lay down on
the couch inside the crate he used to be
a pirate and fought off a group of
ninjas now we're introducing pirates to
this alright nodding through a
chain-link fence perhaps any of those
two escaped from the kennel Dog
Shawshank Redemption I could imagine him
standing out in the rain too pouring
down freedom all that got into a fight
with YouTube execs on Cal's behalf
that's a good one we need some sharks
and
the story somehow pulled the bumper off
of a truck that's how he did it
Dougy kryptonite treats as he fought
giant cat robots from outer space were
they ninja cat robots could be defending
a GT 740 from a big nasty bullet gtx 660
was a fan blade strike during epic
midair battle I like that I like the
inclusion of the actual hardware their
secret ninja obviously when in doubt
could be aliens fighting alongside the
humans against Sauron all right also the
elves and all free folk dorbz he got
shot into work she got shot in the war
bar fight with a shark it's be a pretty
fun bar to be a part of Dave put a he
did a whole story here adopted by this
man Tito Leibowitz he's a small-time gun
runner and a pit bull fighter promoter
born to this we'd like bitch of a mother
he was always a shameless man
and ashamed of this man wait ashamed of
this and then right after I completely I
completely read that first the first of
all to understand what happened to here
you got to understand who here the dog
was I hate anyway thank you Dave I like
I like your whole story that I am Dee
fury ax overheated exploded as it flew
towards him as he threw it on his way to
and they flew it exploded as it flew
toward me he threw himself in the way oh
so he sacrificed himself for me I like
that one too I might go with that one
walking down the alley in the back one
night we don't really know what happened
just just came up with a scar and then
you're supposed to tell there was
something about you should have seen the
other guy
I think was the other option wow they're
a lot more there's quite a quite a many
responses quite many responses he
thought an arctic Panther that's a good
one there yeah and if anyone asked you
say he should have seen the other guy
it's beautiful all right guys that is
gonna wrap it up for this episode 3 of
probing Paul thank you all so much for
watching I hope you have enjoyed it you
can hit like button down there cuz
that's always a good thing to do I have
links in the description for my store if
you want to buy shirts mugs or glasses
and mugs like this one as well as pint
glasses and all those good things if you
want to ask me more questions leave them
down in the comments and I'll be coming
back to this in particular before next
