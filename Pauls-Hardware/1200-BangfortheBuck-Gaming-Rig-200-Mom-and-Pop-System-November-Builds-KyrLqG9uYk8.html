Paul's hardware this is my monthly
builds video for November 2015 so click
right up front explanation of how this
actually works every months or
theoretically every month I do a couple
builds I create these builds in theory
so you're gonna be looking at today is
not actual systems I'm putting together
it is going to be parts lists so if
you're here to see a build don't fret I
do build these sometimes but what these
we are looking at today is builds based
on your feedback the one that I did just
last months for October we actually
built so this is the $500 powder that
was a seven hundred dollar system
because they didn't have a graphics card
we basically built the system or had a
graphics card we basically built the
system without the graphics card which
made it about 150 bucks cheaper and you
guys can check that out it's on my
channel it's live right now and that
build turned out quite nicely it's very
happy with that so beyond that I also
get some feedback from you guys and
that's how I decide which systems I'm
actually going to put together in theory
these systems are the cost of the system
that I'm listening in the title of this
video is just the system doesn't include
a monitor or peripherals or Windows so
bear that in mind as well unless I say
otherwise of course because I have done
full builds as well and lastly I wanted
to point out that you guys should vote
because the builds I'm doing today which
is gonna be a $1200 bang for the buck
gaming system this is based on last
month's straw poll what kind of bills do
you guys want to see for November it's
all hundred-dollar bang for the buck
system one so I got that I'm actually
pretty excited about how that system
came together with what's available
right now and some of these deals that
are going on for the Black Friday
holiday time period of the year and then
one last thing is that I'm not planning
on building any of these systems that
I'm outlining for this month I am
already working on some December builds
though or getting parts together to do
one of the systems in December so
everyone please go ahead and vote and
for anyone who's in chat right now I
want to post this so you guys can vote
as well on what you want to see for
December now for this straw poll I did
the votes based on CPUs or the system is
based on CPU so you're basically
gonna choose a system or choose a CPU
and then I will build a system kind of
based on that I try to mix it up how the
builds are formulated each month defect
in so we got a 59 60 X 60 700 K I 3 60
100 which is the new skylake CPU that
just launched it's a dual-core but it
does have hyper threading interesting
interesting situation there but super
budget skylake or about his budget sky
like as you can get also also have a
couple Athlon CPUs in there the x-48 60k
is an ever-popular super budget AMD chip
that you can build with although
performance wise it's you know you kind
of get what you pay for so I was
actually on the fence about building
with that chip today but I didn't
there's also the FX 6300 which is AMD's
six core CPU which is a bit more
expensive than the 860 K but also very
popular kind of bang for the buck CPU so
guys you can vote on more than one of
those if you want just let me know what
you're interested in seeing and for
today we are going to jump into the
$1200 build first here's all my saved
parts list so you can see my builds I've
been for for instance May July August
September October now they're all the
way down here in November so there's my
twelve hundred dog gaming bang for the
buck system and then now we're also
gonna be taking a look after that at my
two hundred dollar mom-and-pop system I
have listed this one as a three hundred
dollar system but actually when I parted
it out last night got it all the way
down to two hundred dollars which is
pretty awesome anyway let's take a look
at the November 1 first this is twelve
hundred dollars total this includes CPU
cooler motherboard memory storage video
card case and power supply again guys
peripherals and and operating system for
instance are up to you but I I squeezed
a lot of power into $1200 when I first
had the $1200 price point I was like you
know that's gonna be really based on
mainly the game or the graphics card so
what's the best graphics card I can
squeeze into a system for $1200 so I
went right for the top with the 980ti
now you can actually get those for a
little bit more of a discount now 630
bucks as opposed to 650 from there I
went to the CPU and I felt that kind of
like the best CPU to pair with the 980
TI like you can't you can't do a 980 TI
in a
and you know an 860 K or something like
that you got to give it something
something some CPU performance to back
up the GPU performance so I went with a
6600 K and from there it was just a
matter of how much money I had left over
for all the rest of the parts so those
two parts together are what eight
hundred and almost $900 right so that
basically leaves you with about three
hundred dollars for the rest of the
stuff that you might need in there which
is doable but let's see how it turned
out and all came together right so CP of
course 6600 K bear in mind guys you for
shopping for a 6600 K right now these
are still hard to find sometimes so
whereas the Amazon listed price here was
252 and 255
it's actually not available that's sold
out so the one that have lists on Amazon
is 320 you can still get it a new egg
they have stock but they're selling it
for 20 bucks more 270 dollars if you
happen to live close to a Micro Center
go into the store and buy one there it's
a great way to do it beyond that we have
to have a cooler for the 6600 K since
the skylake CPUs do not ship with CPU
coolers built into them so the hyper 212
plus bang for the buck great this is a
bang for the buck system in my opinion
hyper 212 was the best bang for the buck
CPU at CPU cooler I even saved like
three or four dollars by going with the
212 plus instead of the 212 Evo
performance honestly is pretty much
exactly the same
Wow you can't even get this for as
little as 20 bucks right now if you
include a mail-in rebate in there I
usually don't include mail and rebates
when it comes to the pricing of the
stuff that we're looking at here is the
motherboard and actually before I before
I dive into that let's take a look at
the graphics card since those are kind
of my to start out parts that I went
with $630 so 20 bucks off the $650 price
point for a 980 TI and if you're
spending 1,200 bucks then I think it's
worth getting a 980 TI if you're not
into the 980 TI if you're on seam read
get a fury X and it's the same price or
right around the same price and
performance goes up or down depending on
what you're testing and what drivers
using and stuff but if your ex is still
still doing really great job even up
against them
I like both of those and this is a ZOTAC
one it's aftermarket cooled so it's
gonna run cooler and quieter and it does
come a little bit overclocked out of the
box as well and you probably able to
overclock this a little bit better than
the stock or reference model okay moving
on
once I had those two parts in the bag at
was just a matter of what is the
cheapest z170 board I can get well a
cheaper z170 boards right now are going
to cost you around a hundred bucks I
found this one from asrock it's a z170a
matte pro 4s so it's LGA 1151 we needed
z170 since we have a 6600 k the reason I
went with that is if you're looking at
bang for the buck in an overclockable
processor you need to overclock it this
is not the best overclocking motherboard
buy that I might you won't be able to
get the most overclocking but you should
be able to least put a 6
push the 6600 K to four point two to
four point four gigahertz another than
that this board doesn't look too bad
it's got kind of a little bit of a
copper accents on the heat sinks there
and black overall so not too shabby it's
even got an MDOT 2 slot which you might
be able to see kind of right there in
the middle so you can drop in an MDOT
two if you need to other than that it's
got four dimm slots pretty pretty
standard you know feature set apart from
that I wanted to show the i/o because
that's you know kind of useful
there's i/o you know you got your USB
3.0 and HDMI only thing it doesn't
really have that I thought like would be
nice would be an a USB type-c connector
but hey we're looking for bang for the
buck and type-c is convenience and but
not necessarily to get you any more
performance for memory I was thinking I
was going to have to go with a four gig
single stick for this build and I was
looking at those and then I realized you
can get a two by four gig ddr4 memory
kit right now for about 50 bucks so I
would this one and of course last night
it was in stock in this morning it's at
a it's out of stock so this is a team
memory kit it's all black so it'll match
and it's ddr4 3000 in fact you can get
ddr4 21 33 or 2400 kits 2x4 gig kits so
if this is one isn't in stock right here
just use that convenient PC park picker
drill down thing and find yourself an 8
gig 2 by 4 gig kit of ddr4 memory gotta
be ddr4 and and and you should be good
to go even if it's 2133 2133 at 2400
you're not going to be using the eye GPU
so I find it that storage this is the
place where I probably see ya this is
where I felt the hurt from the budgets
the most was in storage I was looking at
what to put in here and I ended up
deciding on this hundred and twenty gig
team SSD it's $40 $40 now what I would
want to put in here is like a 240 or 256
gig SSD that's kind of my standard right
now and those you can get for 70 or 80
bucks this was just to stay within the
price but it's not even a bad SSD all
that you know all that said as well and
hello it's everyone in chat I told you I
hi thank you thank you guys
everyone who's live right now you guys
are fantastic and thanks for joining me
okay
but this SSD like 120 gigs look at the
rating it's got a five-star feedback I
think it's a SandForce controller or
something like that but it's a team it's
scat 550 megabytes per second reads and
writes 520 megabytes per second rounds 5
550 reads lease and I ops anyway it's
gonna get you the speed that you need
but this is the one major caveat from
this system this $1200 system that I've
put together as is hundred and twenty
gig storage is all you have so the
Assumption here is that you have a hard
drive lying around somewhere an old
laptop hard drive perhaps something
that's in the 500 gig range or higher
that you would also drop into the system
otherwise you're gonna be limited to
like you know GTA 5 and maybe one other
game that you can install on this SSD so
that's that's my that's my biggest
shortcoming on the system but hey it's
still within budget
moving right along since it's micro
micro ATX board I went with a micro ATX
case this is a cooler master n 200 which
as you can see here again has a $20
million rebate which isn't included in
the price here but you can get it for
pretty cheap forty to fifty dollars ish
and this is a nice case part of the
reason it's in this combos because it's
a it was actually combo'd with some of
the other parts that are going on here
but you got some USB 3.0 front panel
everything you'd really need nice
ventilation and all that good stuff let
me pull up some better pictures painted
interior it looks pretty nice it's got
space for whatever you know for the
stuff you'd want to fit in there lots of
length for that lengthy
980ti graphics card and just a nice
budget case all around it'll kinda it
does it gets the job done the only thing
that I might want to do is now it's even
got two fans for some reason I thought
it didn't have a fan in the front but it
does anyway pull the master and 200
matches with the hybrid 212 finally we
needed a power supply and again go into
the budget I was like alright we need at
least 600 watts for a 780ti and I want
80 plus bronze because that's the
minimum I'll go with when it comes to
power supply efficiency rating and yeah
80 plus bronze 650 watts
turns out oh and it can't be like super
ghetto like it can't be one of those
no-name brands I've never heard of so
Silverstone is a reputable brand when it
comes to power supplies they have this
one available on amazon 650 watt 80 plus
bronze this has like a hardware which
shoot shoot
this one has a gold award from hot
hardware I believe I think that's right
anyway this this was very positively
reviewed by one of the sites that
actually does full power supply testing
and everything it's not going to look
very pretty it does not have good
cabling it's not modular but it will get
the job been 650 watts and you should be
you should be pretty good 50 amps on
each 12 volt rail so that's enough for a
980ti and that's all
$1200 for a gaming system which includes
a 980 TI and a 6600 k and a pretty
decent feature set besides that again
just add add a hard drive or something
in there that's pretty happy of this
1200 bucks anyway you guys are you're
shopping for you know you send in your
Christmas lists out or whatever to your
parents or whatnot
check that out and yeah I'm impressed
with what you can get from your money
for that alright let's move on to the
next build the next build is a
mom-and-pop system when I talk about a
mom-and-pop system and basically saying
not for gaming and not for doing any
like heavy lifting if you want to do
this for for like work or something like
that if you want to use this for like
AutoCAD or I don't know anything that
requires a lot of CPU power this is not
the system for you this is a budget
system it costs $200.00 and this is also
uses a BGA ball grid array integrated
CPU on a motherboard and that starts off
right here but the total price is just
under two hundred dollars hundred ninety
eight ninety five total from right here
and it's all starts out with this Intel
quad core Celeron processor the J 1900
which is integrated into the as rock
this asrock motherboard there's only a
couple motherboards you can get there's
an as rock and a Battlestar I kind of
view bass rock as a step above Biostar
which you should probably too but you
get your cpu built in there and it's
even got a little passive cooler on it
so it's not going to make much noise
beyond that you know the motherboard has
kind of the features that you would
expect it's got integrated video so
that's your GPU your CPU and your
motherboard all kind of in the same
little thing here so it's got HDMI out
DVI if you're going 1080 you got support
for all that it's even got some legacy
ps2 ports on there basic sound options
this will do your basic computering just
as you might expect and and I was
looking at it I was like that's pretty
cool Tevan got two DIMM slots even
though they're set at perpendicular
angles to each other which is different
you don't see that too often but hey
they're trying to cut down on the board
space beyond that we need some memory so
with a single stick for eighteen dollars
of Team Elite four gig memory you want
to go with faster memory if possible but
the board's only rated for 1333 so I
just went for 1333 this is a single four
gig stick and then you even have a
little bit of upgrade so you can pop in
another four gig stick if you wanted to
and hey they're only $18 I'll get the
job done the harder the hard drive or
rather hybrid hard drives less slash SSD
is the one here that I was a little bit
on the fence about this is the Seagate
500 gig momentous XT which is a heart
hybrid it's got a 500 gig hard drive and
then it's also got some NAND flash in
there that works as a caching drive for
for the the
the spinning mechanical drive it makes
it perform the performance you get that
kind of instant responsiveness in a lot
of situations like you would expect with
an SSD without opting to pay for an SSD
and you get 500 gigs of space and for
mom-and-pop system it's simple it's
viewed by as just a single drive you
don't need to do any configuration or
setup stuff and it is noticeably faster
than a standard hard drive now look
looking at the prices here for this at
Amazon you can get it for $58 however
the other pricing on this is more
expensive closer to 100 don't buy this
for $100 if you're getting anything more
than 50 $60 for this remember that for
70 or 80 you can get a 240 256 gig SSD
and I would definitely recommend that
over this dread this one I just went
with because definitely little bit
cheaper 500 gigs of storage so she'll be
plenty for a mom-and-pop system and
again you get that kind of SSD ish
performance with it so I think it was a
good choice you can shave off a good 40
50 40 ish dollars off of the price of
the system by going with like a bare
bone dirt cheap 160 gig mechanical
spinning drive which you can find on
Amazon for like 20 bucks or less so keep
that in mind as a possibility if you're
really trying to save money
finally we needed a power supply and a
case I found that in this Roseville r37
9 - M micro ATX slim case taking
advantage of the fact that you know
we're really not planning on popping in
a graphics card or anything too
expansive in this this is ATX case it's
got the power supply integrated it's a
pretty basic look black and white
doesn't need to look too pretty just
needs to get the job done which means it
can fit your motherboard in there it's
got the hard drive integrated again not
going to look pretty but it's going to
get the job done now one thing one final
thing I need to point out with this case
and this build just in the interest of
full disclosure is that you would need
one of these this is a 3.5 inch to 2.5
inch drive bay adapter that Rozsival
case does not have a 2.5 inch drive
mount these you can find in your old box
of computer parts if you're me I
actually have way too many of these or
otherwise they're they're really
easy to find so make sure you got one of
those have got to mount that drive in
there the way you should anyway that's
all for this video guys I really
appreciate you guys stopping by if
you're watching live I know I don't do
these and a regular like cadence I don't
have like specific times that I set up
so anyone who is watching you guys are
just kind of they're on point for when I
went live or when I tweeted about it if
you guys want to see more videos like
this then of course subscribe to my
youtube channel
Paul's Hardware hit the like button the
thumbs up button down there if you
enjoyed it again I'm not building either
of these systems that I went over today
but I do have some builds on the channel
and they're my builds playlist if you
want to check that out and then I will
be building a build I built I build the
I build be building a build in December
so make sure you vote in the the straw
poll the link is down in the description
and also in December are coming up soon
I have this that system right there
that's an ass that I built with Logan
just recently so I'm working on that
edit and getting that all together too
anyway thank you guys so much for
watching and we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
