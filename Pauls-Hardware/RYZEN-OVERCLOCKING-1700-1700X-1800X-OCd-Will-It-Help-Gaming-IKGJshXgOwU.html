hardware this is my second rise in video
where I'm going to be talking about
overclocking as well as hopefully some
additional coverage on not just the 1800
X which is installed right here but also
the 1,700 1,700 X right here and I want
to keep this kind of open and just kind
of take you guys through my day
I'm going to be validating my tests with
Grand Theft Auto at 1080 because that's
where I saw the biggest amount of
disparity and my initial tests that I
posted yesterday and I'm also going to
be using Cinebench r15 just to validate
as we move through if our overclocking
is actually getting us additional
performance or less performance or if
some of the sort of tweaks and changes
that have been suggested by AMD and some
of the other motherboard manufacturers
are actually having much of a
significant significant impact
i expense the evening last night setting
up yet another new test better sort of
reconfiguring one of my old ones for the
motherboard I have the Asus crosshair 6
hero using the latest bios versions
available five seven zero four I'm told
there's another BIOS revision probably
coming out next week and there have also
been micro code updates that AMD is
working on so there are updates to a lot
of this hardware that has just launched
that should theoretically improve
performance to some degree now this
motherboard has a unique feature with am
four boards in that it has a mounting
solution not just for a m4 but ATS also
managed to do am three months on there
as well so because of that I was able to
upgrade the cooling solution to a
corsair h100 IV to now bear in mind if
you guys are planning on doing something
like this at home you might want to
consider this the backplate which is
required for the course for h100 IV to
the one that comes with this motherboard
is still in a m4 backplate so I was
actually forced to take the backplate
for a of three for my saber tooth 990 FX
revision two in order to actually get
that fit on there anyway all that being
said make sure you've got the proper
backplate so that's definitely doing a
better job keeping things cool just in
my brief testing I've done so far it's
re about good 5 to 10 degrees cooler I'd
say to my initial test from yesterday
for the graphics card we got an EVGA
GeForce GTX 1080 for the win - that's
the IC X version so this
is overclocked out-of-the-box and am
running is over clock speeds these are
the same Corsair Vengeance lpx memory
kit that's two by eight gigs I'm going
to set this to three thousand speed
although I refer these initial tests
I've just been running it at stock 2133
also did much nicer SSD with this build
as a patriot Hellfire four hundred and
eighty gig SSD and I have a fresh
install of Windows 10 on that like just
installed last night said all the
windows updates I'm running the latest
version of the Nvidia drivers three
seven 8.6 six which is available and I
think that pretty much rounds things out
for the test bed oh that cool the power
supply is in course i HX 1000 i and then
i also have an extra one terabyte SSD
connected via USB 3.0 and that's got a
bunch of my games and stuff on it up on
the top you can see my results from
yesterday and that is what the 1800 x 68
50k and 7700 K this is Cinebench
multi-threaded here since is it a bench
single threaded here and these are the
results multiple tests that I ran in the
past week or so GTA 5 at 1080 is where
we saw a good 20 frames per second
lagging behind for the 1800 X and I've
just rerun all of these tests with my
updated system here and I found that my
numbers went down so this is at stock
with the crosshair 6 hero 3.7 and 4.1
gigahertz is what the CPU is running at
3.7 on all cores 4.1 gigahertz when it's
doing 1 or 2 cores and I've done none of
the optimizations that are recommended
by AMD or Asus at this time there's my
Cinebench score for multi thread single
thread and then even my GTA 5 score drop
down from 118 to 105 so I'm not exactly
sure what's up with that but let's see
if we can improve that that's just a
starting-off point so we're going to
make things better from there also
really quickly wanted to go over some of
the stuff that has been sent to me by
vendors so I am using ghetto notepad for
this but this first one was from AMD
that came in a couple days before launch
actually happened this is when they
recommended that you use Windows high
performance power profile profile and
that was to make sure that since then my
pure power and precision boost
technologies have the ability to respond
to varying workloads as quickly as one
millisecond so the switching time is
slower if you're set to balanced and it
can take
to 30 milliseconds switch between power
states so we should set it to high
performance that's definitely one thing
that we should want to do
here's another list of things that AMD
sent over again this is direct from AMD
this was them addressing some of the
information that they were getting about
1080 testing in the gaming performance
not being up to snuff what they're
saying is that some games don't reflect
that as much as others and they wanted
to make sure that if you are
benchmarking games that aren't
performing as well that you maybe get
some of the good performing games in
there as well as well as well so
separately for battlefield 1 the
divisions Star Wars Battlefront
Assassin's Creed syndicate battlefield
hardline overwatch Witcher 3 and Dead
Rising for according to AMD aren't going
to show as much of a performance deficit
in at least in the 1080 testing from
what they're saying so I'm not testing
any of those results so I'm not going to
give it the best run at it in this
respect because I'm going to stick with
GTA 5 for now but they've also
recommended running the latest bios
toggling a simultaneous multi-threading
on or off making sure that you're set to
the high performance plan also a fresh
OS image of Windows thankfully I have
done that make sure there are non
background CPU or temperature frequency
tools in the background that's going to
be a challenge if we want to actually
monitor things while we're doing it but
I'll try with and without make sure the
system has Windows high precision event
timer disabled although when you
actually try to use the rise and master
software it tells you to turn on high
precision event timer so you can't
really use rise and master to configure
things and high precision event timer at
the same time right now which is kind of
confusing but hopefully that will be
fixed in the future and then they also
have a note here about Intel platforms
which I don't know honestly I wouldn't
really go around to changing my Windows
testing configuration to accommodate AMD
but there you have it anyway so we're
going to try some that stuff and since
we already started with most of that
turned off let's go ahead and turn some
of it on so I want to start out in the
BIOS I think for overclocking and I'm
going to do what I would probably
normally do if I wasn't making a video
which hopefully will make for a good
video too which is to just go ahead and
kind of try to
try to max out everything right here
from the BIOS we're going to try a do CP
1 which is overclocking profile that
Asus does and that is to allow XMP
profiles to be used and about so this is
just going to dial in the ddr4 3000
timings that the memory is supposed to
run at I also did an overclocking preset
to extreme Tweaker overclocking presets
I'm just messing around with the presets
here this is set our BC ok frequency to
112 it'd be fun and then I do want to
adjust the voltage here so again I'm
going with some settings that are
recommended by Asus for this board which
is 1.35 volts on the actual vcore we're
going to go for 1.2 volts eight one
point to bump up the dim voltage to one
point three eight five and we'll leave
other stuff at ATO all right
where what does this get us right now
target cpu speed is twenty-six
thirty-six point for it's a weird number
due to that VC okay and we got going on
right neck
so let's go to manual CPU core ratio and
just did fit here is what the frequency
is FF IV is the quartz frequency
multiplier the ID is the core frequency
divisor so we're just going to continue
if I D here and let's set it to set it
to a four gigahertz that's high T of 143
that's just nothing can go wrong
no idea what I'm doing refresh windows
install I'm not running any background
CPU temperature freaking schools high
precision event timer is disabled I can
verify that I know because when I try to
actually do rise and master here which
I'm not going to leave running by the
way we can see when I try to engage a
different profile it tells me that HP T
is not enabled so I'm just gonna leave
that as it is
oh and then also of course we must go to
our power option
power options and high performance is
what we want and never never go to sleep
computer you stay awake for all time
okay that's prob about enough time let's
away is it still in single building
single core mode
none of that all right run see what
happens
Oh oh dear I think that means it however
clock that's table I moon shot failed
damn it let's see what I would normally
do after something like that happens
which is go back to Lou it optimize
default will start from square one again
and let's just let's just dig through
here and try to find the stuff that I
think I know what I am doing with that
divider should divide divide 40 by 20
and that equals 400 what again the
custom CPU core ratio is 2 times the FIP
divided by D I D so 2 times 160 is 320
divided by 8 4,000 right I'm sorry
not not 4,000 40 times our base clock
gives us 4000 mega right that's that
that's starting to make some sense to me
I don't know why they can't just
sustainable two-player but there you go
alright performance faster not going to
use I've manually set the memory to 29
33 we're just going for 4 gigahertz
overclock and then I am going to go back
again down here to the voltage and do
some manual entry so I could spell it
exactly what I wanted to be which is
1.35 for the core voltage 1.2 okay
Daniel love first month quake 2 for the
SSD voltage and add in voltage read set
to one point three eight five there we
go everything else going leave it I'll
and let's see how this turns out words
cool alright so we have booted into the
Windows operating system once again
which I always considered to be a win
after dialing in a new overclock so
let's split up Cinebench I have waited
just a few moments for everything to
settle down as far as
system loading up and everything and I
am running cpu-z at least at this point
because I don't know I don't know if it
qualifies as one of the monitoring
programs but I did want to verify that
yes we are at 4 gigahertz and then the
voltage is a little bit higher than I
dialed in its gonna about one point four
one seven right now but so see how it
handles Cinebench preparing the project
and I'm still set to one core all right
now let's try all course that's probably
a little bit more serious well
alright just a small change a bump the
core voltage setting the BIOS up to one
point four one two five so just above
one point 4 volts we are now actually
getting up above 1.5 according to cpu-z
which is high but let's let's see if
that changed anything at all going for
the 8 core test again a core 16 thread
test I should say and I don't know
should I keep my hopes up I mean it is
it is going does seem to be doing better
than before I wish I knew how hot
everything was getting the CP the fans
certainly are ramping up
hey that's an improvement look at that
17:58 success okay so I I'm trying to go
for 4.1 gigahertz and I'm probably not
going to hit it but I wanted to give it
one more shot basically I use the same
settings at last time which includes the
increased voltage to one point four one
to five and I have just bumped up the
base clock be CLK to 102 point six which
gets me up to four point one gigahertz
and a little over 3000 megahertz on the
memory and again no idea is it going to
work enough but so give it a shot just
because I am that curious about the
temperatures and everything I'm going to
keep rising master up at this point it
does have a temperature listing here and
it is already quite warm I mean the fact
that we're idling around 60 tells me
that this probably isn't going to be
something we can maintain but you know
again if you have liquid cooling or
something then maybe it would maybe just
be more effective he goes that didn't
take long
Wow that's not a normal fog either it
was just like hey no sorry
all right guys if this is functional and
the temperatures aren't too crazy bad
I'll probably call this as my overclock
for my 1800 X again I'm doing this
pretty pretty quickly I would normally
do much more validation and long-term
tests and everything but for the sake of
a quick video just to see you guys see
what we can get this is where we're at
so I have done just a very minor change
from that original 4 gigahertz overclock
I bumped the base clock up just just
ever so slightly like one not shuts up
100 point two which does get us just
above 4000 megahertz for CPU frequency
and then for the memory we're running at
about 29 to 29 40 2950 just a little bit
of boost from that be CLK improvement
let's hit run here and cross our fingers
that we're going to be a reasonable
speed core speed does look like it's
dipping just a little bit you might see
that there again I'm not you
strict monitoring software here but you
can see the temperature getting pretty
warm they're hitting 81 degrees Celsius
fans are ramping up you can probably
hear them in the background but I'm not
seeing too much core speed dipping
so that's a good thing and also of
course the fact that it hasn't crashed
is that's also a good thing so yeah
definitely got pretty hot but definitely
might not want to run this full-time but
um you know those appear to be at least
stable for our purposes right now and a
score of 1719 there's actually a little
bit less than our previous score of 1758
but still still not bad at all and then
of course we gotta check GTA 5 with you
settings so with that overclocked in
place 4 gigahertz overclocked memory at
29 33 at 29 50 ish basically we saw a
nice improvement in our grand theft auto
scores again this is testing at 1080 I
ran through them twice and I'm just
averaging all five of the scores from
the built-in benchmark about 129 frames
per second 129 and a half still not
seeing the same full frame rates that we
saw with the 68 50k in 77 hundred K but
it is good to know that by increasing
the clock speed we can get a bit more
performance out of the 1800 X and this
might also mean that if we can at higher
clock speeds with the other Jeep other
CPUs 1700 and 1700 X of course being our
two options that we have right now or
theoretically even say like the risin 5
CPUs that are supposed to still come out
if those can go higher frequency since
they have lower core counts then we
might see better game performance out of
them and games where you don't need 8
cores and 16 threads all that said
though uh get these out of the box I
think I'll start with 2 1700 also a pro
tip if you're going to swap out a CPU
from a system you've been overclocking
with always load optimized defaults
first
here's the baseline for the 1700 again
running its stock it supposed to have a
three gigahertz pace and a 3.7 gigahertz
boost but I just noticed it was pretty
much running at 3.2 gigahertz all the
time if I wasn't focused on overclocking
I might try to figure out what's going
on there but some say I'm overclocking I
will just move on in overclock it and
run all the cores at a higher frequency
we had a 1375 score in Cinebench single
that score was 137 and then in GTA 5 at
1080 we got 108 point for average frames
per second that's actually a little bit
faster than the 1800 X was in my second
two tests at least this morning but bear
in mind that was without those
optimization steps so I'm thinking maybe
those optimization steps did have some
impact on improving this score although
again it's still significantly less than
the scores I had in my original test run
last week now I will overclock so let's
do that beautiful and a nice score - and
hey here's your proof that's if you
don't want to pay 500 bucks for an 1800
you know pay pay like what around a
little over 300 you get a 1700 overclock
it to 3.9 and then you're just about a
hundred megahertz short of what a 1800 X
will be able to do anyway 1685 those
next chord and here's the overclock 1700
score and GTA 5 120 5.8 that gives us
the final result here for the
overclocked 1700 a very nice boost I
would say going from the stock frequency
up to 3.9 across all cores and again a
nice boost in the gaming performance
again still not quite matching up with
the 1800 X and still fall short of the
safety a 50km 7700 UK but again
definitely worth it considering the
lower cost of the 1700 the guys have
jumped ahead a bit I've spared you the
stock testing for the 1700 X here are
the results though it's a 3.4 gigahertz
base clock and 3.8 gigahertz boost clock
CP
however when I was actually running it
XF our extended frequency range was
definitely kicking in because it was
running at about 3.5 gigahertz base and
3.9 gigahertz loose on a single cork
when it was on all cores it was about it
was running at 3.5 and also I noticed
this in this extra applies to all the
tests the crosshair six hero is running
a 100 point six base clock when I'm
using default settings so that's
resulting in slightly higher than the
actual numbers to like three point five
two or so gigahertz anyway 1504 was the
score for Cinebench 147 was a score for
Cinebench single thread and one 11.1 111
dot one frames per second on average for
GTA 5 and then we have again here's my
GTA 5 final run benchmark and I think
although grant is my methodology is not
a hundred percent perfect for this video
this was more of a free-form I wanted to
benchmark I wanted overclocked I'm not
doing the proper amount of validation
I'm not running the test enough times
I'm not even doing the proper burnin for
the CPU to get the proper temperatures
I'm not even really monitoring
temperature as accurately as I could but
what I am doing is overclocking these
processors getting achievable stable
overclocks at least for the tests that I
am running and showing definitely some
improved performance from that so we
look at our 1700 ex-members the 10
adventure multi tread score while
overclocked 4 gigahertz was 1714 the
single thread score was 161 and GTA 5
got 127 point 6 frames per second so
again just a tick slower than 1800 X
speeds also running it for 4 gigahertz
and just take faster than the 1700
running at three point nine years so
pretty much expected from from all
perspectives except of course
temperature again I would I would
completely disregard my temperature
column right there because yeah I'm not
a hundred percent certain that all those
numbers are accurate but to draw some
conclusions from this because I think we
can drop some conclusions despite my
already mentioned flawed methodology one
would be that if you're overclocking on
Rison it's definitely worth your while
it's definitely going to give you a
better performance to crank all those
cores up to running at a higher
frequency three point eight three point
nine you should probably expect based on
my testing here as well as based on
vendors and other reviewers who i've
talked to three point eight to four
gigahertz you should be able to hit with
any of these chips you might be able to
get four to four point one but beyond
that is really really challenging unless
you're doing exotic cooling or ln2 or
that kind of thing also with voltage
once you get past that one point four
voltage point temperatures just start to
spike like pretty insanely so that's why
you definitely want to consider a
higher-end cooling solution if you're
potentially signing to overclock
although I would like to rerun these
tests possibly with an air cooler to see
if I could get also in that range
without having to spend one hundred plus
dollars on a closed-loop liquid cooler
and finally to answer that last question
about can you fix the rise in gaming
performance issues that we've been
experiencing especially at 1080 by
overclocking and the answer would be you
can make them better but definitely
still haven't seen it achieve the same
level of performance as I was hitting
with Kaiba Lake systems and lestrade
well each system so if you're thinking
about buying Rison and you're just going
to be gaming with it it's still tough to
say guess go for one of these processors
I would say either hold out for a risin
five chips because I'm imagining those
are going to give you more bang for the
buck when it comes to gaming performance
or if you've are even considering kb
lake or Broadwell even them well I'd say
a view like if you're strictly going for
a gaming
PC is going to be a good option for you
right now but that's up say Rises those
have its place and if you're doing
things beyond just gaming if you're
going to be gaming and streaming at the
same time for example if you're going to
be doing heavy video editing or whole
wide range of actual workstation tasks
then these are awesome values for the
money especially when you can compare
them to Intel higher-end Broadwell II
offerings that's all for this video
though guys I hope you've enjoyed it I
hope it wasn't too long hit the thumbs
up button if you did and links to pretty
much all the hardware that I use is down
