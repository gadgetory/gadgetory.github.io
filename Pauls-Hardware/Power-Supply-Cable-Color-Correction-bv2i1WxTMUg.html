welcome back to the channel Paul here
and it's just a kind of a lazy Sunday
morning I am doing my thing working out
some computers back here behind me and I
wasn't really planning to do a video
today but I decided to make one this is
what is hopefully a tutorial I'm not
sure if it'll be a tutorial because I
don't know how things are going to turn
out yet on how to deal with unsightly
power supply cables specifically the 24
pin but this can't apply to others as
well let me give you an example of what
I'm talking about so this is the blue
build that I did a month or two ago in
the BitFenix ages case and this is going
over to my cousin so I guess that
answers another question I get asked
often is what do I do with old hardware
the builds that I put together this
one's go to my cousin but I couldn't
give them everything that was supposed
to be and I had to swap out some parts
so for instance I got a 960 instead of
the 970 because it's my only 970 I need
to keep that for benchmarking I have a
thermal take ni CL 32 cooler in there
because I using the NR max cooler for
this month's build as well which is
coming very soon stay tuned for that and
then also I had to swap out the power
supply because that BitFenix power
supply I was actually borrowing from J
now that power supply had really really
nice sleeved cables I'm switching it out
for the cooler for the Corsair CS 450 M
but let me let me extract this really
quick from my totally legit static free
workstation it's a chair and bring over
here to show you guys so this is the cs
450 M a little foreign 50 watt power
supply since I'm using a 960 this will
have plenty of juice this is a great
power supply 80 plus gold rated and and
lots of other stuff too it's got partial
modularity it's got nice all-black
cables but it has a very very common
thing that I see with lots of systems
which is this part of the 24 pin so if
you've ever watched awesome Hardware the
live show the cowl and I do every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time you might have heard us do the Pitt
my PC bit that's usually on Kyle's half
of the show and we often rail on this
when it comes to builds as far as
something that people could fix up and
make better cuz it's like that I got
nothing against a rainbow you know
rainbows are pretty but like nothing
matches here you got this kind of darker
orange you got black you got rid you
have like this
teal and blue and purple and gray and
it's just is hideous none of those
colors match theoretically the color is
line up with like different voltages and
all that stuff so it's somewhat
important I guess but if you don't want
to do what I did and spends like half
your life or half a month at least on
doing a custom sleeping job which looks
great but it's just it's insanely time
consuming I decided I wanted to figure
out a way to do it much quicker and much
simpler and something that folks could
at home without too much trouble so
here's my solution basically I'm going
to be spray-painting this section of the
cables with plastidip in a very similar
manner to what I did with the SLI bridge
tutorial that I did a couple weeks back
I know they're very very similar videos
I have no excuses in order to do this if
you want to do it at home you're going
to need some Plasti Dip itself I'm using
the camo version of black because it has
a bit more of a matte finish as far as I
can tell and I like that matte finish
you're also going to need some painters
tape or some masking tape because we are
going to want to mask this off and
that's about it you'll need an open area
usually you should do this outside in a
well-ventilated area and then I'm just
going to be masking this off now I'm
going to mask the sleeve itself up to
about here I'm going to paint over this
so it kind of keeps maybe a little bit
more uniformity from there to where the
cables go and then I'm going to be
masking off the plug here the reason I'm
using Plasti Dip is well there's a few
different reasons one is it's flexible
so since this cable is going to need to
bend over yeah it's going to need to
like Bend pretty significantly like that
in order to plug in and route to behind
the motherboard tray the the plastic
enos of the Plasti Dip and it being
flexible it's much better for that if
you use regular paint it might crack or
something when you actually try to plug
it in i hope the Plasti Dip is stretchy
enough to do that another reason is that
it's completely non conductive and
different types of paints can have
different type of conductivity you
really don't want to risk getting some
paint up in up in here and bridging one
of those connections accidentally so for
that reason again Plasti Dip is just a
bit safer third reason is this will void
your warranty most likely but if you're
really frugal or whatever and that's a
concern of yours Plasti Dip does peel
off kind of just like plastic if you
want it to and there is a chance that
you might be able to peel everything off
right here now the the pitfalls that I
might be
dealing with here are going to be the
paint getting kind of clogged up in
between the cables right so hopefully by
using the proper painting methods of
starting to spray off to the side and
spraying over the cables will fix that
but yeah I'm just going to go ahead and
mask this all off take it outside
spray it down and we'll come back and
see what the results are
so I ended up actually doing a couple
coats on this
I trade the first coat on with the
cables pretty much going straight I took
it and based on where the clasp is under
here I kind of bent the wires in the
direction that they're going to be when
they're actually installed in the case
down there that sort of separated some
of them and exposed some more of the
places that hadn't gotten paint on them
and I was able to go in and kind of do a
little bit of cleanup now there's
definitely some rough spots this is
definitely looking to be more like a 10
foot mod but I think it's getting the
job done so you can see where some of
the the Plasti Dip has kind of fused
together especially where the wires are
coming together
there's also spots like right under here
where you know I didn't get full
coverage I could go back and do further
coats there but when this is installed
it's going to be bent that way and I
think that'll be okay also getting up
like under here which is going to be
kind of visible and then spraying even
down towards the interior of this was
something else I did to try to minimize
just anything that came through I got a
little bit of pooling of the Plasti Dip
along the edge here but I think it'll be
alright I'm just removing the last bit
of masking here and then I'll give it a
give it a shot in the case and see what
it looks like one other thing I
mentioned this in my SLI bridge video
peeling this off can sometimes start
peeling the Plasti Dip here as well I'm
going to use an exacto to separate it
but a tip I got and thanks to those of
you guys who posted in the comments
section on that video is that if you
remove the masking while the Plasti Dip
is still wet and it will just peel off
and it won't start peeling up the Plasti
Dip too so that's another possibility
and there she is ladies and gentlemen
the the finished product or at least to
finish finish enough for now
the whole bill doesn't put together yet
but if you're wondering what I was going
to do about the power supply itself I'm
going to use the power supply cover at
the BitFenix he just comes with and that
will kind of block off some of the green
from the cs4 50m the cable model or the
modification of the actual 24 pin I have
mixed feelings about I honestly was
hoping it would come out just maybe a
little bit cleaner than it did it's not
bad by any extense
but I mean you can just see especially
where all the cables come together some
of the kind of
mishmash II stuff that happened with
Plasti Dip there and and you know it
just wasn't perfect it's it's as I said
a ten-foot mod from further away it does
I think what it's meant to do which is
it blends in and it doesn't draw
attention and it doesn't make it look
like just a mash-up of color that kind
of throws the whole color scheme of
everything else off apart from that I
have kind of a primary color scheme
going with some red a little bit of
yellow from the Crucial Ballistix memory
that I threw in there and blue of course
but I think overall I'm happy with this
the fact that it is still morning right
now and I'm done is a very very
significant factor in that so let me
know what you guys think though I think
that's really what this is going to come
down to is if you guys think that this
type of little modification is worth it
considering that it was like seven or
eight bucks for the can of Plasti Dip
which I actually already had masking
tape and that's pretty much it maybe an
hour worth of your time depending on how
much you spend on unque blowing Andry
cabling things and also how many coats
you do I end up ended up doing a third
coat and I think that's probably the the
most significant thing that I learned in
this little mod was that pre bending
this section of cable in the direction
that you wanted it to go and and
twisting that so that it exposes any of
the wires it might be kind of kind of
laid out in that position it's really
really helpful and doing that a third
time and adding the third coat is what
helped me pretty much cover up just
about all the color that might be
peeking through there let me know again
in the comments guys what you think of
this mod if you think it's worth it
should it should you do something like
this should you go for like paying for
cable extensions which might cost you I
don't know thirty to sixty dollars
depending on what you get and how many
of them you get or should you just go
full out and likes leave your own cables
like I did with arctic panther let me
know what you think let me know if any
of you guys are actually considering
doing this mod that now that you've seen
me do it
and of course leave me a thumbs up on
your way out if you enjoyed this video
stay tuned for your s and benchmarking
stuff coming up this week don't forget
to subscribe for those and we'll see you
very soon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
