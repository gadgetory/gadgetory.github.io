favorite I know economically the design
it's still one of my favorites and my
onyx it's like a house it's like a
pillow for my hand 7,000 but hello
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
it is Tuesday November 14th 2017 the
world is still here everything's still
here and we're gonna talk about
technology today we're also gonna drink
some beer we're also going to
potentially use adult language so please
bear that in mind if you're easily
offended if you have small children

with something that doesn't let noise
through beyond that we do the show every
Tuesday evening and we stream live to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware and
also to our YouTube channels right now
you're watching my half on Paul's
hardware the second half is going to be
streamed at Kyle's channel bit with
links to that is in the description as
well as links to all stuff we're going
to talk about today the description on
YouTube that is shout out to our twitch
viewers howdy folks and of course you
guys on youtubes as well

few left of the smaller mugs just a few
a few other sales going on tournament
starts to check it out also Kyle store

still going strong all good stuff it's
okay not really good we'll jump at you
at the end and I've just opened our
first ever bottle of black Tuesday from
the brewery that's the name of the
Brewing Company this is the brewery it
seems an ideal choice for our show as we
stream on Tuesdays yes you know we
should have opened this on the week of
Black Friday we could have had two black
weekdays in one week that's okay though
maybe I'll buy another one heavy if it's
good nothing more blacker yeah it'd be
extra black and this is a special
limited edition beard seasonal and
actually one of my cousin in lausanne
wifey sauces side recommended I get one
while I had the chance before they sold
out everywhere the special thing about
this Imperial Stout that's aged in
bourbon barrels is that it's 19 point
something percent ABV good lord
yeah so we're taking actually taking
this step up another shoe if that's not
the darkest beer I've ever seen last
week's beer which I don't remember the
name of even because there was so much
alcohol that was 16.7%
I remember that call boy what was it
called again the rump kid from kid
pumpkin is here sent in by a fan we're
gonna be doing mail time on cows half of
the show as well as discussing all the
important things pretty much every
important thing that needs to be
discussed yeah we're gonna talk about a
I'm both halves sure will and let's dive
right in we're almost ready alright very
ready I think we're ready okay here we
go
cheers Cheers give this give this black
Tuesday Ivan I have proper drinking
glasses but
you think we sold those in a store or
something yeah Wow out of that very
flavourful we are going to die hmm
you know what's scary though is that it
doesn't even taste like 19 percent it
doesn't taste like easily 10 percent and
I believe it if someone holds me so
dangerous which is very scary
it's tasty it's really good whew it's
dark and mysterious Oh delicious
all right let's proceed like we're like
blackout - yeah first thing that's gonna
be hot heavy heart rate let's talk about
some new hardware stuff at I'm heavy
most of the hardware news from this year
who's already do you know the big stuff
the big launches has gotten past but
there are some products launching just
in time for the holiday season starting
off from be quiet be quiet the dark bass
700 I like this case why do you have one
I think right here I did a building one
no it's actually completely built on the
table there oh is that built earlier
this morning okay so that's a video
coming tomorrow on floatplane and then
and then we'll come on the main channel
I gotta get I gotta get used to the
plane thing I'm out yeah we do have a
video to show in just a second here but
um this seems like a pretty cool case it
is very nice as a follow up to some of
the other stuff that they've done in
this series like the dark bass pro 9 900
and I have worked in and it's got some
nice features there it's my favorite be
quiet case by a lot like honestly the
dark bass pro it's kind of like all the
good stuff about dark Bass Pro 900 but
in a mid-tower form factor let's I'm
gonna talk about 6 bps customer Bryan
right well Bryan Bryan totally scooped
you with his video I know by the way he
always does
Bryan where's the sexy there's a sexy be
no one's more likely to scoop me than
Bryan
alright so Bryan would steal new video
this has tempered glass side panel RGB
lighting one of the things I really like
and I'm sorry I got ahead of myself
pause brands it front panel IO right
here look at that USB 3.1
uh-huh ah type-c port right there that's
a 10 gigabit per second and it's got the
internal header right there
it was it was the first time I've ever
plugged one of those into a motherboard
for so satisfying it was so nice it's
such a nice upgrade something there USB
3 it was great so that's that's very
nice to know all sauce tears is poor
position faint controller hmm Auto one
two three
yeah beyond that though you got its
reasonably sized supports up to e-atx
but not not like full everything he ate
CX is that there's a size limitation
twelve point zero eight by ten point
eight two inches not all the ATX
motherboards are made into the same so
you just got to make sure it's fits
within that steel abs plastic and one
point two millimeter aluminium a four
millimeter thick tempered glass side
panel Wow that's perfectly that timed up
was nice Brian Bureau good job Brian
he's on it there's these stripes along
the front as you can see right now
brian's brand new cables a little
rickety tables that's like me for the
first four years of my chance that's
true crappy costco fold-out table for
four years but what i was trying to
point out here finally it's this wood
this LED going along the edge here this
is really nice to go six different
colors now can you also tie it in I mean
you love how it wraps around the foot
the feet yeah that looks pretty cool can
you also tie that in to your motherboard
yes okay so it has a six color
controller that you can just do default
or you can connect it to your
motherboard right and have it sync all
up 240 millimeter silent wings PWM
6-pole motor fluid dynamic fans FDB fan
bearing fans which is they're super
quiet oh yeah and a three year warranty
launched today
removable mother tray and removable
motherboard trash and say yeah and
what's it a it was like the dark bass a
modular design
modular design so as you can see lots of
pieces come apart here with the
motherboard tray and you can flip it and
rotate it and stuff so a lot of the
features of like dark Bass Pro 900 for
sure one hundred and seventy nine US
dollars yep for the MSRP so it is a
little on the expensive side but it does
seem to have you know the feature set
that you'd want for a case you're
spending that much money for my god
sorry
189 euros I guess but she was different
isn't isn't it usually more US dollars
than euros uh maybe because be quite sad
German company they get a bit of a break
there so the changes the currency
exchange rate I honestly don't know I
just maybe then I don't I don't look at
the money market either maybe the euro
has tanked recently I saw somewhere that
it was 175 euro which would be around
well this is but it's still pretty
that's too close
well that from one of the other articles
yeah I'm not sure text by articles no
cell said YouTube's dropping frames like
they're hot really he didn't say like
they're hot part I added that for
dramatic effect but he did say that
they're dropping for I don't know tell
ya I don't tell you cell fix it oh it's
your job because it's at 60fps I can
switch the 30 on the fly right maybe no
I can't I gotta stop all right be right
back well you're back don't go anywhere
make sure not to uh and the actual
Street continuing continuing on like
nothing ever happening is the same the
same now except if there was a frame
rate issue hopefully it should be better
now
mmm-hmm theoretically yeah we are at
30fps where Kyle's and he hasn't updated
to the gh five yet no actually not the
gh4 can do 1080 60 you needed upgrade
you're sure your capture camera from yes
you should get the new that what I've
got this got coming out in the 4k 60
yeah I just got I just tell another
older ones and I feel dumb I need to
return it or something and is it out yet
yeah
4k 61 so I think it's coming out really
soon I've only seen a few a few things
about it cool all right thank you guys
for the heads up thank yourself with a
heads up on that one hopefully it sounds
like from chat things are looking better
now moving on for hot and heavy hardware
X 299 motherboards
any sky like X fans out there it's
powerful hardware so there you go
Asus is releasing a trio of workstation
X $2.99 motherboards which are useful
for Rick station any type people who do
work station any type things sounds
racist that's set racist against
workstation epa sees a specific goal is
to bridge the gap between standard
desktop motherboards and higher-end xeon
offerings so this is work with sky like
xep is the the article doesn't seem to
indicate that they're gonna work with
Zeon's asus has done crossover stuff
like that in the past but it's not
currently listed although you know if
intel will somehow let them I'm sure
they'll they'll give it a shot there
here's a look at the specs though
there's three of them the X 299 sage the
X 299 Pro /s E and the X 299 Pro all
with WS in front to mean the workstation
the stage is the biggest then it is a
SSI CEB sized motherboard so it's a
server it's a server specification but
this should fit and most EA TX at most
cases that support EA TX it should fit
in
it's got full seven full size PCIe slots
and a PL x bridge which is the first
this is the first X 299 by the board
I've seen what's at PL x bridge might
might give it enough PCI Express Lanes
to compete with Red River oh snap but
yeah it doesn't mean you can run a quad
by 16 setups or you can do a by 8
connection to all seven slots at the
same time so that's cool and yeah it
looks pretty cool too that's another
thing I like about the workstation
motherboards AC status they look pretty
sweet at least you know the ones they've
done in the past 3 4 5 years and a very
viable option for someone who's building
a high ends you know workstation gaming
system or something like that who
doesn't want the RGB thing
yes because you got a really clean
nice-looking motherboard granite they're
gonna be more expensive because their
workstation but you know if you're
building an X 299 then maybe maybe money
it doesn't matter to you maybe you have
lots of it
yep plus I think the workstation boards
also have slightly higher grade
componentry than like gaming gaming
oriented Watson used like higher
capacitors and other the surface mounted
Hardware on there that's rated for the
longer longer lifespan mm-hmm
there's like some workstation systems
have to be running 24/7 right so I think
they're accounting for that that's why a
bit more commands to be used in
situations where like you know your
business is relying on yeah right kind
of thing not your game save or whatever
yeah all right one more one more bit of
heavy hardware here from cooler master
this time RGB liquid coolers cooler
master is finally jumping on this
bandwagon but actually I don't think we
one of the first be honest yeah well
they do lots of RGB stuff but not a IO
liquid coolers now they do have them but
I think the title I think the title here
highlighting the RGB look at the chorus
is that I mean that is yes something
that these do but I think that price is
actually something that stood out to me
a bit more the 240 $60 $70 $70 and the
120 is $60 what that's what that's what
it says here that's what the that's what
PC game that's what Paul Lilly says I
don't Paolo II wouldn't lie to you
I don't know we Paul's our honest people
but yeah there's the new Luther course
how is it super cheap I don't understand
then sort of devalue all of their other
coolers I mean potentially like it's got
RGB I just don't understand it now
that's their actual product page how do
they do that it's got RGB so it's it's
got the RGB Coolermaster logo in the
middle and yeah that's very helpful
pictures so comes it comes with this
little this controller RGB controller
which is the same one in the the 610 air
cooler than any recently which is nice
little easy to use
a very nice solution solution and you
can connect up you can daisy-chain
several strips to it or several items to
it if you want to so that's pretty nice
to have but yeah there's there's a kid
it comes with its low-profile dual
chamber RGB pumps with six lighting
effects and the controller lighting is
compatible with RGB motherboards from
aster our case use gigabyte an MSI so
it's got the basic four pin RGB comes
with master fan MF 120 our RGB fans
supports all modern Intel because
consumer sockets including LJ 2066
AMD support goes up to and includes
Rison so you get a socket that am sorry
am for support but does not support
thread Ripper um your switch is fine I
mean der Tauber get one of the inner Mac
starter for coolers those are actually
really nice the link text yeah yeah
they're good solid yeah the newer
designs and those that look pretty cool
too the pump design on this is man is
manufactured in-house I want a designed
in-house by Cooler Master too so I
wanted to point that out to it is not a
nice tech pump kits that they slap their
name on or anything like that so that's
that's that's weak alright let's move on
cool segment number two for today is
gonna be the classic sword fight sword
fight is where Kyle and I argue about a
very like a hot subject something very
controversial it's hot we also provide
you guys with strawpoll you guys can
vote on you know you're free to vote at
the beginning or you can wait and hear
our arguments we're gonna take each side
because we can do that we have the
flexibility and our frontal lobes to
take one side or the other and hopefully
come to a conclusion then we'll see what
you guys think about it so we're gonna
start first off about Game of the Year
Game of the Year and none of them
current the current option it all sucked
for games gonna here I hardly played any
games this year this is sad this is
and in their bus right so currently up
for game of the year we have legends of
Zelda breath as well yeah Super Mario
Odyssey yeah
player unknowns battlegrounds yet
persona 5 what horizon zero dawn yeah
now argument here is for player unknown
style grounds which insanely popular
game we've played it we've talked about
it we've benchmarked it however still a
steam technically a steam early access
game technically still in beta not like
that they they won't tell you that it's
a full fully launched game yet they're
still developing it so should it be
eligible for game of the year that is
the question right now we're gonna we're
gonna argue about this what do you think
should player unknowns battlegrounds be
eligible for game of the year of 2017 or
should it's should have wait should
maybe it should wait for its full
fruition and maturity in 2018 what do
you think I feel like the obvious choice
is yes that it should be eligible
obvious choice so I'm gonna argue no oh
no it should not be eligible I'm playing
devil's advocate here okay I'm gonna
take the underdog side because a game
that's an early access there should be a
separate contest or awards ceremony you
posted the chat by the way to be a
separate award for beta games or games
that are still in development ongoing
games that have not been fully released
yet I don't think it's fair to compare
or best unbeli released games yeah well
yeah I mean or just no you're right that
sounds you call it the blue ball level
there should be no award it should not
you should have to finish your game
before it can be ranked in or given an
award or eligible for that sort of work
I feel like it's not quite fair I feel
like it's it's probably it's the best
beta one of the best betas ever because
it's been in beta for so long they've
been able to patch it regularly and keep
iterating it and fixing all the bugs and
making it better
adding new things but I don't know I
feel like they're just sort of riding
the beta wave they're like it's working
for us right now like we don't like they
don't feel the pressure they they feel
zero pressure they're on top of the
gaming world right now they feel zero
pressure to actually turn it into a full
game or label it is that you can get
away with a lot when you're when you're
still in beta and I feel like there's
just something not right about it again
playing devil's advocate this isn't fair
to say that I honestly feel that way but
I could see how other developers who
actually completed their games might
feel a little salty and rightfully so I
think that Blue Hole needs to just man
the eff up already
it sounds like an insult but that's
really the name of the studio the
developer no I'm not 12 go away people
with Chad blue hole boo-boo yeah
I think it's I think it's dumb finish
this by the way now I really want to
play pub G yeah hurry up go on with your
stupid argument good tell me why you're
so on I will say yes of course it should
be eligible for game of the year because
it has broken a bunch of records on
Steam as far as like most concurrent
players and that kind of thing tons of
people are playing it right now
it's it's doing good for the computers
in general for PCs and PC gaming it's
drawing more people in who have heard
about this phenomenon and who are like I
got to get in on that people are
enjoying it so what more can you say
when you're trying to rank games of the
year it's a game it came out this year
it's one of the most popular things that
people are playing and enjoying and
people are like building computers to
play this stuff like that so I think if
you think that that's wrong then you are
against your anti computers and I feel
like that's kind of that's kind of
insulting to all of us but maybe
Battlefront you should be eligible oh
and it's in it because it's technically
welcome in beta will come - that was in
beard
yeah
I think the argument is about front to
has had the amount of successes alright
so guys you can feel free to continue
continue voting or whatever gonna check
out the results
no should not be eligible oh wow wins I
was I'm surprised actually no I I knew
you're gonna win the whole really yeah
because people because I read the
comments on their head okay so this has
already been yeah in discussion okay
yeah I mean the argument people are
making right now resting wih their does
Bethel guns be even on this list when
it's not even a fully launched game and
yeah like like you said yeah there's
something to be said for that right just
because it's successful doesn't it you
give it that status all right thank you
all for your wonderful participation
here yay next up we have a topic that is
is really super super hot on the
internet right now everyone's talking
about it EA has gone and given people
yet another reason to hate them we're
gonna be going to into this in depth on
Kyle's half of the show Walker for right
now though and for the purposes of sword
fight we are going to specifically take
a look at some memes that have been
birthed as part of this boo this current
every other word was normal and then you
got to bird point being though we're
gonna take a look at some of these memes
I've come about as a result of this and
we're gonna figure out which is the best
okay because I like that if anything
that we that can be gleaned from you
know the fodder of the Internet's and
people hating on something it is epic
memes yep so the source of this of
course is Star Wars Battlefront
- mmm-hmm which he is developing and
they the news came out recently as to
some of the practices going on about
this EA went on reddit in order to
respond to
some community complaints about this and
said the intent is to provide players of
the sense of trying to accomplishment
for unlocking different heroes as for
costs we selected in the initial values
based upon data from the open beta and
other adjustments based on milestone
rewards for launch I'm not gonna read
this whole thing basically they blow a
bunch of smoke up people's asses about
why they're trying to charge a bunch of
people for things to unlock in the game
unlockable heroes it is the most down
ranked reddit comments ever well are
they charging people for items in the
game I thought it was they were they
were requiring an insane and certain
amount of credits to purchase certain
things in game that credits you can but
then you can buy the credits with real
money right so it's it's basically pants
unlock heroes paints unlock things that
other people it's like that would take
you just way too long but it's not just
the paid unlock stuff that's better but
it's also the wait I lost my train of
thought there it's not just painting a
box of stuff that's better but it's also
the egregious amount of work that it
takes in order to unlock stuff manually
cuz they're all well you can just play
the game and unlock this like just grind
or whatever right there's a bunch of
stuff that's come out as far as like
stuff that's locked like certain quests
you can only do a certain number of
times a day and then it's locked for 14
hours so three times so it's basically
they're pushing people as much as they
possibly can towards spending more money
on the game via unlocks and stuff quick
question before sorry I have to ask do
you know if these things that people can
potentially unlock actually improve
their gameplay let's improve Oh does
absolutely okay then that is a problem
yeah I was gonna say this is just
cosmetic then who cares but yes
legitimate use for that's pay to win yes
the legitimate use for like in-game
upgrades and upsells and stuff like that
make them cosmetic like that's fine yeah
buy a pretty hat you know buy a World of
Warcraft cute little pet that takes a
hundred hours to mark they give money to
charity for something like that yeah
that is an appropriate use of in-game
purchases this is not and
the all of the bad feedback that's a he
gay yeah alright so first name is the
opening crawl from Star Wars Battlefront
to the intent is to provide players with
a sense of pride and accomplishment for
unlocking different heroes as for cost
we selected initial so the blue is based
upon take the initial comment basically
yeah this and this will be the opening
credits they want players to read the
opening credits opening credits
hilarious here's number two is new plans
for an x10 controller as a front I am
shocked that's not already a thing it's
good this that's a way an existing meme
I didn't see anything with added in the
commenter but it doesn't make a lot of
sense I like that it's got the chip
reader in there too though that's
honestly that's not a terrible idea at
all
yeah I mean if you didn't want the game
or you know your data your credit card
information to be stored in their
database and you just swiped it every
time you want to make a transaction I'd
be a real easy way to do it instead of
having to input all the data the digits
by controller or whatever I don't know
all right Kyle like I don't know why I'm
defending this me Mouse I'll totally buy
that I'm being way too hard about this I
thought this counts as a meme but this
is this is an interaction with EA
customer service today everyone's like
shit
and then they ask may I know the reason
for cancellations I'm sure you've heard
same reason as all the other customer
supports who's who's must be going
through hell right now be nice to them
if you do have in common
they're just doing their jobs people
they're not possible this is this is a
very appropriately reused me sinking the
depths previously only theorized please
black hole theory with the EAS karma and
that is before and then finally we have
the the pragmatists
for the pragmatist meme here which is I
would say yeah we got en a no they're
not gonna make any any money cuz
everyone's hating on them right now but
there's no point yet oh yeah compare
they're like the reddit
their mentality people who are
complaining about it versus all the
other gamers who are just by gonna play
the game yeah it's a very loud minority
things that they complaining about so
that's funny there's are memes we're
gonna we're gonna argue this of course
right now which one do you think how
what was your favorite this is obviously
very controversial um there was some
more - I have to apologize just for any
honorable mentions that I missed I did
see a couple more today after I had made
this list I gotta say that I mean I
talked a lot about the controller I
think that that's a hilarious meme I
think that's pretty good
the customer service knows thing is
equally funny because that's just
incredibly meta like even even their own
customer service like yeah we got cheese
probably a script thing that they can
just push now they're calling for that
we understand that's is the reason we
understood yeah that's my quick argument
yeah I mean they turned off the refund
button did you catch that he ate it
yeah really they turned off the
responsibility for that game or just
specifically for bail French for
Battlefront - I didn't about that so
people had to call in in order to get a
refund that's a dick move which
apparently I haven't verified this but a
thing I read said 60 or 70 thousand
people got refunds or something like
that but I was that might not be
verified I want to I want to clarify
that but um yeah lots of people getting
refunds due to due to some of this
nonsense
but again all right Sophie so you're
gonna go we don't need to argue this I
think cuz we've already spent enough
time of it but you're going for the cut
for the controller the next gen
controller yeah I'm gonna go with the
opening crawl just because I thought
that was a pretty classic when was that
again this is the stuff at the Star Wars
oh yeah yeah
just a giant excuse yeah list of
bullshit now provide players with a
sense of pride and accomplishment for
locking the first people to grind while
playing about getting frustrated against
people who have just worked out money
heroes and yeah and now have a leg up in
in the battlefield so to speak because
they have cash and you don't know that's
shitty pay to win should be shunned all
right so let's take a quick look at
responses thank you to all who voted I'm
a bumper service response all right that
is Lani I want both sword fights hey
Plus customer service right there
and yet Akai wins with the next-gen way
control e opening crawl coming in third
sad truth in last noise noise noise it's
just it was too real mystery no yeah
it's anger expressing is for nothing
and we will be talking a little bit more
about that whole debacle in my half as
well indeed a tune all right what is
next next news is good old standard
basically what standard Ted just news
there's nothing more really that
technical well it's it's alright I'm
solving is turning the Lord of the Rings
into a TV show have you heard have you
heard about this no hear this I'm not
surprised though everything gets its own
TV sure there's the Ring of Power with
the power the looks like my wedding ring
the language is that of Mordor which I
will not utter here no do not but anyway
amazon has won the rights to the Lord of
the Rings television series to produce
television series of this good they have
also done a multi season commitment to
creating a TV series and the Lord of the
Rings universe the way the article reads
makes it sound like they're going to do
something in the Game of Thrones style
as immediately thought that but the
comparison there seems to like people
simply being oh it's gonna be a clue to
rings but like
with people having sex while they
discuss important plot points and stuff
like that and a lot more rape and incest
I guess but I don't know I don't
necessarily think that's exactly what
they're going for but just the way that
the game of Thrones is kind of this epic
medieval style rape story being told
over what's fantasy and all that kind of
stuff yeah that's what they're going for
I wonder though since wow I don't know
can can Amazon get away with the same
kind of crap that HBO pulls as far as
like yeah I mean they could make it as
our graphic and visceral as Game of
Thrones if they wanted to what what do
you what is your take on that because
the movies are nothing like Game of
Thrones in that sense um but I would be
kind of an interesting spin I I guess I
mean the comparison obviously is Peter
Jackson's work with the Lord of the
Rings material which that's not which I
really liked at least I mean at least
not The Hobbit but the rest of it right
and yeah obviously you can go grittier
and dirtier and and that kind of thing
as evidenced by Game of Thrones I I
don't know if I would want it to go that
direction but I could see it be a little
bit more adult themes to some degree
yeah but you also got a look at the
source material material and chair or
token and like you didn't he didn't
write about a lot of read but tortured
stuff like that yeah there's obviously
evil and bad things that happen and then
that kind of thing but right not that
much graphic description so I feel like
if you want to stay a little bit more
true to the series who the source
material then then you wouldn't go super
hardcore with it yeah but yeah I mean I
can do with some more violence yeah
violence I'd be cool with that violence
is fine he was right this is not ray
swords just like yeah man on man
violence I guess that's good study rape
but you know what I mean yeah
yeah I don't think that's what I meant
okay no Jeff Jeff Bezos the you know the
owner of Amazon our CEO of Amazon has
reportedly asked Amazon Studios division
to focus more on the big prestige worthy
shows with global appeal similar to Game
of Thrones this new show will explore
new storylines proceeding in jr. are
Tolkien's Fellowship of the Ring with
the potential spin-off series also
included as part of the deal so it's
going to be prequels it's gonna happen
before The Hobbit I don't know if
they're gonna go back because it really
is a second age I mean that's the thing
there's so much history in the universe
so like everything in the Hobbit and
Lord of the Rings is Third Age and
there's still stuff that happened before
the earlier in the Third Age before that
stuff and then second agent first date
so I don't know but there's a lot of
cool history there's a lot of cool
stories it's really cool universes Peter
Jackson have any involvement no I don't
believe so
okay and there's lots of long-lived
characters as well who do exist in the
current and in the Lord of the Rings
series that you guys may have seen
usually like the elves and stuff yeah
you got Galadriel and Tom Bombadil and
and and Elrond and quite a few other
characters such as that so cool that
revealed how much was paid for the
rights to the show but reports claim
that Amazon Netflix and HBO were all
originally approached with the offers
and it was priced in the 200 to 250
million dollar range which is pretty
crazy but it's some pretty drool-worthy
intellectual property to purchase of
course but that does is to make it as
expenses as expensive as Jeff Bezos his
entire acquisition of The Washington
Post which is kind of crazy to think
about as comparison anyway those insane
next up Firefox has a new version out of
Firefox Quantum and it's been getting
some pretty positive feedback from what
I've been reading they've made it much
faster which is obviously always a good
thing
when it comes to internet browsing but
Firefox version 50
seven there's no there's nothing there's
no other this is a ARS technica article
but there's nothing besides that picture
of Firefox so they have a sleek to
interface it's got major performance
enhancements under the hood faster to
load and render render pages user
interface should remain quick and
responsive even under heavy load with
hundreds of tabs whoa hundreds it
specifically says fact checking that one
yeah so since Firefox was originally
developed was initially developed web
pages have become more dynamic and
structure and applications are richer
and more graphically intensive
javascript is also a lot more complex
complex and difficult to debug secondly
computers now have many cores in
simultaneous threads giving them much
greater scope to work in parallel so
it's been updated to take advantage of
that and security also remains a
pressing concern prompting the use of
new techniques to protect against
exploitation some of the rebuilt
portions are even using Mozilla's new
best programming language which is
designed to offer improve security over
C++ by the way who opens a hundred tabs
I'm it's because I know if I get to the
point where the tabs are so small that
all you can see is the icon and no
letters I start to get worried that's
and then they can get even smaller than
that to where it's just the X it gives
me all you have is the X to close that
gives me way too much anxiety to get
close to that I can't handle that
I'm like I don't really need I can go
back to this I'll reopen this one I open
like penguins behind us hang with oh
yeah
stupid ass lockscreen right this was a
really cool PC master-race
right as we started the show or as we
started the show the background computer
just said to do windows update perfect
timing
so yeah Firefox Quantum check it out
they have Firefox version 57 not this
current edition of it but that actually
kicked off back in September with the
developers edition I guess there's been
a big uptick in developers working with
it to stop oh and apparently they're
puffins not oh heavens puffins my
apologies
can't say anything on the internet about
being correct is an egregious what does
assumption this
yeah shame on you call shame on you well
cool all Johanson new you the new
Firefox quantum yes fun alright let's
talk a little bit about the internet and
using its and connecting to its you have
an internet service provider in Colorado
there was a there was a it's it's
November so there was a votes back in
people voted on things last week here in
the United States in a lot of places
it's only 2017 so this is kind of a mid
mid election so there wasn't a lot of
stuff but there was some stuff but among
them were some votes going on in
Colorado about exempting specific
counties from a state law that prevents
municipal broadband deployment
I know the word I want to say by the
time I get to it I'm sure I will
remember what the word is but yeah back
in when was it 2005 Senate bill 152 was
lobbied for hugely by big
telecommunications companies Comcast and
whatnot and it got passed and basically
what it says it's like hey hey you
people in Colorado you better not get
with your city and start to like create
a city owned municipal broadband service
that provides other broadband
connectivity options for their citizens
you're not allowed to do that
that's what come cash head that's the
law that they passed okay it's lobbied
for by Comcast I've got as well as well
as other internet competition or but in
2005 they basically outlawed in Colorado
the municipal broadband unless the
county specifically goes and has a
voters have to go and specifically
approve to not go with that state law so
on Tuesday there was a coordinated
election in Colorado two counties voted
on the ballot and exempted themselves
from that state law yet again which
increases the number since 2005 of many
many counties and it's getting close to
half of the counties in Colorado have
exempted themselves from this Eagle
County in Boulder County are the newest
ones but yes this is
just sort of further proof that people
want to have options when it comes to
connecting the Internet's options are
good and if your state or if your county
or your city wants to go and start a
broad bands you know service for its
citizens they should be it should be
fine for them to do that and a big
internet service provider company
shouldn't go in and create laws against
it so yeah it's good good job to the
folks of those counties for going
forward with that and yeah cool okay
that's pretty much it
beyond that's we talked a bit about net
neutrality on the show here and there
and we talked in the past few weeks or
that month yeah at least a couple weeks
ago about a vote that might be coming up
on the restoring Internet freedom rule
what is called the restoring Internet
freedom rule by the FCC that's actually
not gonna happen as was initially
anticipated it was hinted at that it
might be on November 22nd that they
would have that vote which would be a
typical day for them to have the vote
because it's the day before Thanksgiving
and Thanksgiving weekend and it's a very
popular time to vote on stuff like that
because people go away for Thanksgiving
weekend and they forget about it so a
popular time for unpopular legislation
to me why not why not just on
Thanksgiving because then the people who
actually vote on it are like wait that I
don't want to work on Thanksgiving it's
a lack of dedication it is it is I mean
you come on you would think that um how
badly do you like the show and best
friends would be willing to do that but
even their soul their black soullessness
but the good news at least temporarily
is that that's not going to happen on
November 22nd there will be a three week
warning prior to the scheduled votes and
if you are if you're in favor of net
neutrality which according to most of
the evidence I've seen most people are
if you're not you work for an Internet
service provider or you've been grossly
misled then that's a good time to call
your congressperson
and let them know what you think about
what the FCC is doing in the meantime
the FCC has other stuff to worry about
but we're not going to go into that
let's talk about Roger Cordrey
you heard first last week one week ago
here on the on our show we broke the
news that Roger Cordrey had left AMD and
potentially was gonna join Intel we
didn't actually break the news we pulled
it up on wucf tech but Roger Cordrey it
has been confirmed has left AMD or is in
the process of leaving Andy and his
joining Intel and that he's going there
to build discrete graphics cards
apparently which is gonna build some
sweet graphics pretty I mean not
physically build himself but he'll help
design so in intelligence great graphics
card yes yes that's that's right Kyle
what and and I'm sure you're thinking
the same thing that Ryan shrout thought
when he wrote this article which was
that Intel hasn't made a discrete GPUs
since they introduced the i7 40
Starfighter graphics card in the late
90s great that was the first thing that
popped in my mind what came to my head -
yep now Ryan shares before I got into PC
bill I'm sorry Josh this is a Josh
Woolworths article apologies jot that
Josh I don't know if you're watching our
show tonight but good good throwback
though there Josh I'm sorry Paul hurt
you baby but yeah after Roger was made
the lead of Rihanna technologies group
back in 2015
their headcount was decreased and their
R&amp;amp;D funds were decreased as AMD was
putting a lot of focus and effort on the
development and launched a Verizon and
also the products derived there
therefrom so the speculation is that
perhaps Roger wasn't feeling like he had
quite the support when it comes up to
the launch of Vega and everything Vega
had a lot of hopes pinned on it and
launch itself was just not quite up to
the standards that people had been
expecting especially given the hype
leading up to that so Vegas
disappointing launch probably had
multiple contributing factors its
but besides that as pointed out in the
article burnout had to be a big factor
in Rogers decision to leave the company
insulin onset on Wednesday that Raja is
now the Intel chief architect and senior
VP of the newly formed core and visual
computing group so we might be seeing in
a few years time because these do things
do take time to develop discreet GPUs
form Intel another quote from the
article while Intel is still using AMD
GPU technology and upcoming products
which we're gonna talk a little bit
about on Cal staff again by the way this
particular higher and rearrangement of
the group points to Intel being much
more aggressive with not only their
integrated graphics but also addressing
the mid-range and high-end standalone
graphics market so it would be a pretty
freakin interesting situation to see a
three-way day
a three-way between AMD Intel and NVIDIA
it kind of messy make it kind of messy
more to the point though but it would be
good for consumers three-way competition
between all of them for graphics cards
heck I don't see anything wrong with
that no but yeah probably what this is
though more so than Intel pushing into
the gaming market although the gaming
market is significant is keeping up with
advances in AI machine learning and
self-driving and automation technologies
which are probably going to be pretty
huge deals they're already pretty huge
deals and their pair gonna keep being
more and bigger huge deals as time goes
on and we have more self-driving cars
and more computers ruling our our lives
and algorithms that tell us what to do
Oh Joey just makes it feel safe anyway
though one last story here before we
close out with some johnson's silicon is
getting more expensive silicon wafers
more specifically the price has been
going up on which is which is according
to this article the prices are expected
to inflate which you might which you
might assume base
done this the original article click
here's from et news about the price of
Korea IT News silicon wafer price
continuing to soar so this could mean
that Nvidia AMD and Intel products will
increase in price as well because
silicon wafer price according to this
article is supposed to go up by around
20 percent in 2018 and this is one of
the base fundamental materials that that
chips are produced from I don't know if
a 20% increase in silicon wafers will
directly equate to a 20% increase in
Nvidia AMD and Intel products but I
don't think it could it could lead to a
price increase yeah to some degree
these reports come from Japanese silicon
manufacturers some co s um Co this is
due to a silicon shortage Simcoe
provides up to two thirds of the entire
world's silicon wafers and they say that
due to an increase of price of silicon
wafers that started from early this year
Simcoe is expecting to make its biggest
performance in recent ten years since
the global financial crisis of 2008 so
to sum up again the producer of
two-thirds of the world's silicon wafers
was like hey the price is going to go up
by 20% by the way we're gonna make more
money this year than we have since a
long time
strange coincidence but does it explain
why there's a shortage like there is a
shortage though like Simcoe is having
experiencing any shortage or their job
well I mean there's a it's there's a lot
of demand I mean there's lots of okay
products being me technically so there
it seems like they're just sort of
adjusting their prices based on demand
yeah potentially they also say there's a
shortage there's a silicon shortage okay
so maybe a little bit of both yeah
alright sure so yeah sure it it it is
nice to be a commodity supplier we kind
of had this similar discussion when it
came to the DRAM DRAM crisis and that
kind of thing like Samsung like oh do
you grant price is a super high cuz it's
been
well let's crank up our production now
that prices are high and we're gonna
have our best our best quarter yet but
the flip side to that is that silicon
wafer industries are limiting themselves
from making extensions of their
facilities so increasing production
building another Factory you might say
like why don't you build another factory
to make more of it because if you
increase that and increase your capacity
for output and then next year suddenly
the demand goes down then some surplus
thing yes some have a surplus the prices
fall back down and you get flip X flips
back the other way so bright obviously
there's two sides to that but ok you
know we'll see how much of an impact
this actually has I guess it depends
like how much GPUs will like video cards
will increase in price for us depends on
I feel like if silicon is worth more
than 20% of what goes into a video card
because I feel like if it's worth more
than that then I don't know I don't know
I'm saying we need a bomb cost breakdown
of all the components of a basic
graphics card you know I haven't looked
at one of those in Wow all right we're
going to it quickly yeah that's all I
got for news we're gonna quickly run
down some of the donation comments that
have been made things still I guess who
do that for us Aaron Barlow $5 cheers
guys cheers to you thanks Aaron Cheers
Aaron Aaron Zachary Trumbull Cheers
by the way this is strong this is lowest
I've ever drink I'm you're gonna taking
it easy I'm trying to be I'm like
halfway done I'm like whoo Zachary
Hummels that looks sorry I haven't seen
the shiner yet today is my birthday so I
took a few days off from work but I'll
send y'all some by the end of the week
no problem Zack thanks Zack thank you
for that
Scott until make six dollars and sixty
six super medal all Pauls well and
appreciate you guys we'll be out of town
next week might not catch you guys the
lives so enjoy Thanksgiving Thank You
Happy Thanksgiving Scott
eat lots of Turkey Charles Phillips 20
bucks let's check hi Paul I just got the
EVGA X 299 for the wind came on the
board and it doesn't fit my fantex case
any suggestions for an ATX case with
room for
some water cooling and thanks for your
videos well you know the case we
discussed earlier today we are faced
about our catalyst really impressed with
it's very some 100 although if you get
like the full-size ATX board for that
case it will cover up the rubber
garments you'll have to probably route
the cables through the openings for the
modular mer drive trace see a few more
bucks on the dark bass pro 900 that's a
really good case yes tons of room and
we're going to 99 build that would that
would kind of make sense if you're cool
the full tower and that's a great option
yeah I mean it's it's large but it's
badass yeah it's not the largest I mean
it's not like a cosmos 2 or a 900 d or
anything like that or they would lead or
an thule ceiling back there yeah geez
but yes
Thank You Chuck those are good
suggestions for you yeah good luck
shadow plays 5 bucks
hey guys can't stay for the whole stream
but I wanted to thank you for inspiring
me to build my first PC just waiting for
Black Friday to buy you're welcome yeah
that's it that's a good time you don't
like the week leading up to Black Friday
like oh yeah tons of deals during the we
have this Black Friday gets earlier
earlier every year yep
all right we're doing black October
black everyone's just every company's
just trying to get a leg up and try to
like desire it as early as black winter
oh yeah January and I add our GB to
everything on my PC well I get a 69%
performance increase like when adding
racing stripes to your car I need to
know please thanks
no you won't you'll actually get an 86%
performance increase so I have tested
this thoroughly and RGB does in fact
affect performance in a very real and
significant way so make sure everything
you buys RGB make sure to spend extra
money on all the RGB things and you
don't get more frames far be it for me
to call you a like way more frames dead
all right
panda commander $5 6700 ka just bought
Izzy 270 board what exactly do I need to
do for everything to run smoothly
getting a graphics card that matches it
yeah get an SSD get a case with decent
airflow get a get a reasonable CPU
cooler like something you're probably
gonna want something that's thirty to
fifty dollars if you're looking at an
air cooler you can get get something
good for that look at options from be
quiet or cooler master or where else I'd
say spend my fifty two hundred dollars
on it if you're overclocking
aggressively yeah you've gotta get a
liquid cooler yeah yeah I mean watch our
videos yeah we will share all make sure
you put the CPU into the CPU socket on
the motherboard yes close the lever and
use motherboard standoffs I forgot to do
that yeah that's important mmm doop
scraps like you've had a tenkan 80s hey
guys hoping you can give my dude Mike's
my good friend Jason a birthday
shout-out happy birthday Jason
happy I feel worse him I force him to
watch your show while we hang out in the
beer so I know he loves it
great fishery as always remember to
floss yeah that's the best way to get
someone to love something is just to
force it on them I wonder Oh Paul you
don't like you don't like ballet
let me just force you to go to ballet
lessons with me but I take ballet
lessons I like I wonder if there's
people who are forced to watch our show
because someone likes it and there's
other people who are forced to watch it
like hate us like I hate those guys cuz
I was forced and they don't care about
techo ever just be very polarizing okay
that's kind of offended like that that
explains all the idea I'm just trying to
drink a beer and talk about yeah you
don't have to watch our show if you
don't want to oh wait you do because
someone's forcing you that's stuff
that's why shouldn't you shouldn't force
people to do it she had us to all of our
oppressed viewers out there being I
guess we're being held to watch the show
against their will if anyone is being
physically restrained right now call
9-1-1 like literally coli how could they
do that if they're being I know way out
good luck thanks back don't give up
yeah you can nod through you can not
through a rope if you give it a half
time but for the warrior seven five
dollars and 55 cents finally catching
another live show no work tonight but
you've your first jobs that got you
out of your parents houses did either of
you go to college yes we both went to
college yeah but the job that got me out
of my parents house was Newegg that was
the first job I got out of college and
before that I either lived at home or I
lived on campus or like you know around
school so Newegg was my Savior I guess
so I'll go with the fruit well cuz I
went to college and then I was back home
for a bit and then I moved out and then
I was back home for a bit and I moved
out anyway the first time that I was out
of college and then I moved out I was
dave and buster's over to Dave &amp;amp;
Buster's oh yeah it's been fun
it had its its funding it's fun it's fun
to attend this is fun to go there sure
on a Friday night I don't know if it'd
be fun to work there yeah yeah got some
stories all right those of you don't
know Dave &amp;amp; Buster's is like a Chucky
Cheese for adults it's pretty it's
family friendly Buster's its family
friendly but they have like no exes okay
most well I mean I don't know how many
if you're in the u.s. right answer here
okay you're sharing it all up in my Dave
&amp;amp; Buster's trivia hey well have you
tried their chicken wings with honey
mustard I will next time because it
sounds delicious
sounds like a really fun job Thomas cost
the third hey you're a third of
something Thomas Constitution ten bucks
own a 7600 K with a gigabyte Zee 270 HD
three the motherboard is irritating for
overclocking with Z 270 dead is it bad
to buy old hardware now should I do an
r5 build value wise since Zen looks to
be upgradeable or coffee-like
LK time MLK means so for first question
you should be able to sell your Z 270
motherboard and 7600 K for a reasonable
price right now they're still very
viable CPU and motherboard our five
build would be kind of a side grade from
that so it's hard to say I mean yes you
have a bit more of an upgrade path from
there
but I mean if you're gaming I'd say just
stick with your 7600 K yeah I mean if
your main concern is gaming just stick
with you seventy six nine okay maybe
upgrade your motherboard I wonder what
he means by motherboards irritating for
overclocking Z two seventy hd3 some of
those Loran gigabyte motherboards they
just don't have very good power delivery
so you can't quite you can't really get
that much out of it
ability I don't I don't know I'm not
positive about that specific board but
yeah I mean some lower end boards
they're just not as good or maybe the
BIOS hasn't been updated to provide you
access to a bigger BIOS locking features
update your bias first
I mean maybe gigabyte hasn't been
updated it because it's a it's not a
motherboard right but I mean if he has
like the same BIOS that it shipped with
or something oh yeah that could maybe
some shirt yeah do a BIOS update and see
if that improves your your overclocking
options but yeah I mean yeah there's not
a whole lot to upgrade from from a 7600
King unless you really need a lot more
cores and threads or something like that
so I'd say maybe consider a motherboard
upgrade or just hang out for another six
months or a year and see what the
landscape looks like thing because the
7600 case totally fine
yeah been said and five dollars hey guys
bought an r5 Verizon 5 1600 X in the GTX
1070 based on your reviews and couldn't
be happier with the priced performance
any opinions on v1 tech the exact they
make the the custom modification
products those guys are awesome yeah
super nice and I have always thought
their work was pretty impressive
I've seen their stuff I've never used
and that can yeah build with this stuff
I like I always talked I always like
seemed at CES and he's like hey send me
some stuff doing a build and I feel bad
cuz I don't follow up yeah I've always
seen that positive experience yeah even
though I've never worked there stuff I
can still I generally tend to rate or
judge a company based on the people who
work there and has songs like super
chill yeah he's incredibly true he's a
super cool guy doesn't mean he's a great
business owner by default but he seems
honestly seems passionate about what do
you do
they're just nice people yeah no
definitely I'm the same way so I would
give them a chance
I can't hurt to try take a child even
child
hmm got an aggressive American tourists
at what you will ever consider arrive
stream of ging with their donator
just with a donator I think it would be
a cool getting stomped on with you guys
in the pub G or another game whatever
the fuck do you know what I mean you
know TV it's funny you should mention
that because did we we didn't do the
announcement at the beginning of they
have to be no I totally blanked on that
all right well we're doing it the
announcements yeah did we did yeah are
you black out Tuesday's I react end like
that
okay say about that TV though we are
planning a livestream charity give that
announcement yes yes that we're planning
last year charity to give Jubilee Wow
can we say that yeah we considered a
great yeah the 9th December 9th night is
a Saturday mark your calendars mark your
sweat in your phone specific time it's
still TBD we're gonna do we're gonna do
a charity event December 9 similar to
last year but a bit simpler we are going
to both have come if you build your
system yet your system mmm from the
dirty yeah they give away I can do that
there 20 minutes okay so I'm gonna do it
three weeks ago Kyle and I are each
building computers we're gonna have
everyone will probably start it off like
a few days or a week before the actual
events but anyone who wants to will be
able to donate we're probably about five
bucks that sounds reasonable right yeah
okay so five dollar donation for an
