paul's hardware this is my monthly
builds video for October 2015 so the way
this works is every month at the
beginning of the month ideally and
apologies I'm a little bit late this
month I'm going to be doing a couple
builds I do them live so I'm streaming
this right now to my twitch channel
which is twitch TV / Paul's hardware if
you want to follow me over there and I'm
gonna be showing you guys the parts for
the build so these are theoretically
reticle builds i'm not actually
assembling them today although i will be
assembling one of the builds later this
month so subscribe if you're interested
in that you can see already some of the
builds that I've done in the past here
behind me apart from being my twitch
channel live this is also going to go on
my youtube channel Paul's Harbor so you
can help me out by clicking the like
button if you watch this video and like
it also links to these builds are down
in the description i use pc part picker
and then if you want to help me out
further than that you can always visit
my store and pick up merchandise like my
shirt here or mugs or glasses or that
sort of thing so going back to pc part
picker that's what i use because i think
it's a great website and it allows you
to take lots of parts from Los lots of
different places and kind of
conglomerate them all together and it
shows you price history and it shows you
like where you can buy them at different
locations and it tips you off to combos
and that kind of thing as mentioned i do
sometimes build these systems like the
ones behind me and i will be building
the one that's based on this motherboard
that's right here next to me in the past
I've done for example the entry-level
x99 build which I assembled nuts that's
that one no that one every day and then
what else have I done Oh recently I also
did I tried this was an experimental
thing but I my two-thousand-dollar
skylake gaming pc build that I did
actually did live so it's a two hour
video and again that was kind of
experimental so thanks to all the folks
who have actually watched that one I was
surprised as many people did who did it
anyway alright so let's get right into
it um oh wait no let's not get right
into it because I'm forgetting some very
important things I need your feedback I
need you guys to participate here
because that is how this works in fact
last month I specifically requested Oh
what's up what's up with a bombs going
off in chat last month I requested you
guys first
budget builds systems are just kind of
looking for a price point seven hundred
dollar gaming system was the number one
request and I also did a thousand-dollar
video editing system for this time
around because those were the top two on
there and then I'm also going to be
asking for you guys's feedback for this
coming month which is coming sooner
rather than later so for November what
kind of builds do you want to see and I
just have a few random suggestions I put
up there we have an email system for a
mom and pop for 300 bucks an entry-level
skylake build I did the entry level that
I did the entry level haswell-e build
our x99 build and that was interesting I
kind of want to do the same thing for
sky like how cheap can you get a skylake
build system built the system for ultra
via a VR ready build could be
interesting or a twelve hundred dollar
bang for the buck system anyway give me
a feedback vote on those links are in
the description if you're watching this
on youtube to those voting things
alright first built here is actually a
very specific build one it is of course
the seven hundred dollar gaming system
that you guys requested but to it's also
a build that I'm going to be building
for my brother-in-law Jason so he
actually started off with a few parts
that he already had but one part in
particular so here is kind of the system
that i put together for him this link
isn't in the description but you can see
most of the parts that i have here and
then also his case city area has on hand
which is a real legacy you to dash B
that's this one right here and it's not
available anymore rosewill has
discontinued this case this is also the
windowed side panel version although I
will be working with the non windowed
side panel version so I already started
out with the case that he had and I kind
of based on that had to choose the rest
of the parts from the system now since
you guys at home can't necessarily
gotten by that case I've replaced it for
the actual build this is the actual
October build seven hundred dollar
gaming system and you can see all the
parts right there and I 560 400 so this
is a skylake system the gigabyte h17 TN
Wi-Fi motherboard g.skill ripjaws 5
series eight gig memory kit a crucial be
x 100 250 gig SSD geforce gtx 950 OC
edition video card from gigabytes
roseville neutron mini-itx which was the
replacement case that i got and then the
EVGA supernova GS 550 watt power supply
and let's just kind of run down each of
these parts and I'll kind of tell you
guys why I chose
and kind of my thought process behind
them because I think that's a one of the
important things about doing these every
month is not just to tell you guys
here's a build put it together but to
kind of introduce you to my thought
process and kind of the way I go about
choosing parts because I think the
process of picking is important and if
you don't necessarily want to build this
system or these systems then you can use
the thought process to choose out your
own parts anyway um does the roseville
Neutron minitower and I picked this one
because it's cheap 40 bucks right now
originally it was ninety dollars it's
mini-itx it's a little bit I think it
might be actually a little bit larger
than the legacy you to dash be but um
it's got like some red LED fans in there
it's got a side window and it's forty
dollars i actually think this might be
going end of life from rosewill which is
why it's on like a kind of a blowout
special right now so bear that in mind I
don't know how long this will be will be
available but forty bucks for mini ITX
system painted black interior all that
good stuff I think you'll be happy with
its let's move on to the base of the
system now when when when my
brother-in-law told me he wanted to
build a new system oh wait now i'm
skipping things in my notes if you want
a different case in that one I just
showed you if you want something else
besides Rosewell Neutron the other ones
i was looking at with the corsair 250 t
the cooler master elite 130 although
that's a smaller little shoebox one
which would still work but i wanted
something a little bit spicier Lanley
has also has a pc dash Q 0 1 B which is
another possibility doesn't have quite
the same finish inside anyway does just
some other options that are available
for you guys all right so I wanted to do
a skylake system and the nice thing
about skylake is it's the newest
platform from Intel gives you access to
the newer technology has like more
bandwidth for your storage and PCI
Express and it's also got like a USB 3.0
USB 3.0 and then some more native
support for stuff like youryour you to
connectivity depending on the
motherboard you get of course you're not
going to get all that stuff the i5 6400
is about a hundred and eighty five ish
dollars 180 I don't know it depends
where you get it mostly say they're on
special right now
but I can't feel like they'd be able to
sell this chip for much more also
consider an i5 6500 which is going to
cost you about twenty to thirty dollars
more but that one does have a higher
boost clock speed this one right out of
the box gets you what does it give you
wait I have notes 2.7 gigahertz is the
base frequency 3.3 gear hereit's is the
turbo you're not going to be able to
overclock this but that's okay it's
quad-core that's one of the big reasons
I went for it full quad core and that's
definitely important if you're going to
be doing some of the newer games that
are out there alright moving along from
that we have the motherboard of course
that's a gigabyte h17 TN I have it right
here we talked about this a little bit
on our live show I really like the
feature set of this motherboard from the
i/o options that you have on the back
which there are a ton of Jason's going
to be using the integrated GPU out of
the gate so it's nice to have the full
feature set there you also get stuff
like USB type-c connector I believe it
has USB 3.1 if i'm not mistaken wait
does it does it even if it's three-point
oh that's still okay to USB 3.0 but it
does have the it has that does have the
type-c connector so that's pretty nice
the other cool thing about it that you
can't see in the pictures here if you're
looking at this on newegg is that it's
actually also got an m dot 2 on the back
of it right there and i like having that
m dot to support this is an m dot 2 PCI
Express connected slot as well so you
can do pcie you can also run a sada n
dot two on there and i believe it's m
dot to 20 to 60 length and 20 to 80
that's supported so i really like that
feature set i like to look at this
little bored too so if you're building
in that window case i think everything
will match pretty nice for you all right
moving right along we got a g.skill
ripjaws 5 series kits this was a very
close call i was actually came down to
the wire here with this kit because i
was originally going to go with a
corsair kit that i found but then the
prices fluctuated a little bit and I was
really trying to keep this under seven
hundred dollars I didn't completely I
wasn't completely successful on that but
it's a 3200 kit so like what I do when
I'm if I'm looking for men
first off like I got to find how much I
want and I wanted eight gigs for this I
wanted to buy two because I want I want
to take advantage of that dual channel
I'm sorry two by four and that beyond
that I was looking for as fast as memory
as I could get because you want to give
the igpu a pretty good yeah you want you
want to make sure that your I GPU can
can handle what you're throwing added
and faster memory faster memory speeds
is definitely a very good way to do that
so 3,000 speed 3,200 speed you can
actually get a pretty reasonable price
for this is a two by four gig kit of
3200 speed ddr4 memory for $65 the other
one I was looking at was a 3000 kit for
seventy dollars she just find what the
fastest is it's that's not lower that's
that's low price if you get too much
beyond that you get to the premium stuff
that's like the cutting edge as fast
memory as you can by the price really
starts to ratchet up pretty quick so
that's why I cut it off at 3,200 but
that'll give you a good performance for
your I GPU and your 6400 processor
alright moving along to storage 250 gig
SSD I think it's kind of the standard
right now ATX for crucial be x 100 of
course there's lots of other 240 gig SSD
options in this little range but i find
the bx 100 to be a good option if
there's others there that you like the
color of better or something like that
then feel free to go for those and then
lastly we have a video card since this
is a little gaming system and this is
gtx 950 from gigabytes i went with this
one because it's a hundred fifty bucks
straight up I feel like it's a great
card for 1080 gaming which is probably
what your ad if you're spending seven
hundred bucks on system and as does it
doesn't look too bad either it's got a
black PCB this is overclocked straight
from from gigabyte this is the I believe
this is an OC version this is it yeah
this is a 950 OC and then they have the
wind force in the extreme but this will
this will kind of get you set up for
gaming then of course you have the
option in the future if you really
wanted to you can always upgrade all
right the final thing to point out here
is that I'm I'm over budget I have to
admit only by $13 713 dollars and ninety
three cents so I was trying to figure
out how to cut down some stuff but i
really like I just just scrounge up
another fourteen dollars I'll say that
all right anyway that's the seven
hundred dollar
gaming system and let's move on to the
next build which is a
one-thousand-dollar video editing system
and $1,000 video editing system I was
like all right let me throw this
together then I found it was more
challenging than I expected because
what's important when you're building a
video editing machine everything like
you need a fast cpu for rendering you
need a fast graphics card ideally a
workstation graphics card are those but
those get really expensive and that's
going to be for like real time effects
processing like you know you're doing
overlays or after effects that kind of
thing you need massive hard drive space
for storage because video files take up
a lot of space you need even bigger hard
drives if you're considering doing 4k
stuff you need a fast SSD so you can
have your roz on there and that will
give you on the fly like it'll be able
to pull the video off there faster so if
you're scrubbing through a bunch of
files or something trying to find your
in and out points that kind of thing
it'll load up quickly you need another
fast SSD if you can afford it to use as
a scratch disk you need lots of memory
for keeping all the big video files in
the memory which is much faster than
even than having them on the SSD so
basically that a thousand dollars for
video editing system yes we can make one
and we can do make a pretty powerful one
but we are going to be making some
compromises we're not going to be doing
the ideal video video editing system
which if you were asking me straight up
I'd say go for as well II system go for
a six core or even an eight-core
processor but those are much much more
expensive we need to keep this under a
thousand dollars so I'm just to run down
the the parts list right off the bat
Intel Xeon e3 1231 yeah I'm with the
Xeon i'll explain that in a second the
msi h 97 pc mates budget motherboard for
just under ninety dollars i got a 16 gig
kick a kit of g.skill ripjaws x ddr3
memory sandisk SSD plus 240 gig SSD i
went with a couple two terabyte hard
drives and then a radeon r9 390 from
gigabytes and then I case and a power
supply you know what I feel like I did I
feel like I completely glossed over the
power supply in the last build so you
know what I'm going to do is I'm going
to go out of order here and jump back to
it because that's something that I
actually wanted to point out did I don't
think I even pulled it up pardon me guys
just one second here yeah did I know I
Wow bit of an oversight on my part
alright I pull this up real quick that's
assuming that new eggs page will load
all right there we go jumping back to
the last seven hundred dollar bill
really quickly I wanted to point out the
power supply because i was looking at
power supplies and i thought this one
was really nice sort of feature set of
things 80 plus gold for first off this
could be very efficient it's got a high
quality components inside 550 watts it
will support pretty much any system you
want to build right now with a single
GPU in it barring some of the very very
highest end GPUs even with like a 980 TI
I feel like you should be able to get by
with it it's also fully modular it's
black and look at the cables that's how
I want to show you the cables the cables
are all black even the 24-pin so it
means if you have a window system and if
you watch Kyle on my live show and we
talk about pit my pc and things that
suck and things that often sucker the
cabling and power supplies and it okay
moving right along let's go back to the
thousand-dollar video editing system we
got 16 gigs of ram i think i got all the
way down to the end and then reminded me
of my oversight on last build which is
the EVGA 600 watt power supply this is a
less expensive power supply because it's
80 plus bronze but again we're having to
cut a few corners to stick within the
thousand dollar price point now let's
talk about the Xeon e3 1230-1 v3 the
reason I went with a Z on there's a
couple different reasons one is that
this is the slightly older platform from
Intel it's LGA 1150 so this is going to
be compatible with like your z97 boards
your H 97 boards and even some z87 and
h87 and some of the other budget
chipsets that are in there as well
double check with your motherboard
manufacturer though because you want to
make sure that if we are using an older
board that has been updated the bios has
updates to be compatible with this new
or xeon but the things i like about this
one is one that is a quad core with
hyper-threading for two hundred fifty
dollars hyper threading is significant
it does play a significant role when
you're rendering out a video rendering
out a video and like you know you got a
20 minute 4k video and you hit render
and you walk away are you going to be
coming back to that and a half an hour
or you're going to be coming back to
that in an hour and a half or in 15
minutes that's that's really your price
is going to play the biggest role in
that so having the quad core with
hyper-threading as well as it being a
Zeon which means you get ECC memory
supporting that kind of thing I didn't
go with that but it is possible and this
turbos up to 3.8 gigahertz right out of
the gates anyway the other alternative
to this one that I was looking at was
like a 6600 k which is a skylake we're
going to pay a little bit more for that
platform overall and you're also going
to need to get ddr4 memory which costs a
little bit more and even with the 6600 k
even though you can overclock it you
still don't get hyper threading so I
think I think for your heavy list heavy
lifting tasks this actually be a pretty
decent choice that's why I went to with
the Xeon e3 1221 v3 the motherboard i
went to pair with it is the msi h 97 pc
mate this is a budget option but it gets
the job done look how tiny these little
pictures are it's blue and black did I
pull up the actual website for this I
did it's blue and black I was not
carrying it all about how this system
would look as purely going for
performance but it's got like some extra
PCI Express slots is not completely cut
down with x1 slots so you have some ad
on potential layer for adding on stuff
for memory slots of course so you can
expand it in the future six say 26
gigabit per second connectors I was
happy with the feature set of this board
the only thing that made me think maybe
you might want to spend a little bit
more money on something else will be to
get something that does have an m dot 2
slot or something like that for dropping
in an SSD or something like that in the
future oh yeah 6600 k not to be confused
with the Q 6600 for those of you
discussing that in chat alright let's
move on to the video card and this is
probably a controversial decision when
it comes to a video card well I chose
the r9 390 eight gig video card from
gigabyte now this is a really really
really important point for any of you
guys are actually building a system for
video editing the GPU is really
important any time you're doing stuff
that involves real time like effects or
transitions or anything like that if you
have GPU acceleration rather than
relying on the GPU it is a night and day
difference just just trust me however
you are dependent on your software for
whether or not you can turn on GPU
acceleration I think a lot of you guys
for editing on windows-based system are
probably going to be using Adobe
Premiere if you're using Adobe Premiere
and you have six point 0 or creative
cloud or newer then you can do GPU
acceleration using nvidia gaming GPUs or
AMD gaming GPUs AMD's is opencl and
video ones used CUDA it's really really
helpful like like I would not do it
without it the flip side of that is
getting a dedicated work sedation GPU
can give you better performance and it
will be more widely compatible with
higher and software if you're doing
actual like cat or you know if you have
other like I actually don't even know of
some of the more industry standard like
high-end software's that are out there
like avid or that kind of thing I don't
know how those work with the
acceleration okay but anyway moving
along the reason I got this card was
because it has eight gigs and video
memory eight gigs is a good thing to go
with but again i'm assuming that you're
using Adobe's software or a dish video
editing software that has GPU
acceleration if you're not if you're
specifically building a system to use
other software then definitely swap out
the gaming graphics card and get
yourself a actual workstation graphics
card that means you're going to be
getting a quadro card if you're looking
at Nvidia are going to be getting a fire
pro card if you're looking at AMD the
other nice thing about getting a gaming
card though for video editing
workstation is because you can game with
it too whereas the quadrant firepro
cards or a lot more finicky about that
kind of thing anyway hurt so where am I
at this is the gigabyte radeon r9 390 a
king a bite video card and this was
three hundred dollars and i found out
immediately afterwards that it was like
sold out so that's definitely a problem
but you should be able to find a 390 for
about three hundred dollars you might
have to look around for a little bit a
little bit of time some of these are
really overpriced than these some of the
other locations that you can get them
for but look for a 390 with eight gigs
if you can't find that for 300 bucks and
look for a 290 or 290x with eight gigs
and those should honestly work just
about the same maybe a little bit slower
and put those are your options
okay feel like I'm moving through this
what's next memory alright so for video
editing you need lots of memory 16 gigs
was about all i could get by with giving
the budget constraints this is a 2 by 8
gig kit though it actually also happens
to be blue i went for the cheapest to
buy a kick kick that i could find that
was from a reputable memory manufacturer
it was also a reasonable speed honestly
1,600 would be fine but the pricing on
this was it's the same for 1866 kit and
it also happens to be blue and it'll
match with that motherboard even though
I don't care alright moving along to
storage one thing that I find to be
extremely important when you're doing
video editing are you doing video
capture is making sure that that raw
footage which is worth so much money
it's saved in a safe location for that
reason I have not won the two hard
drives these are hitachi two terabyte
hard drives these are fairly well known
to be good performing drives long
lasting drives they're 65 66 dollars
each and I got two of them because you
can put them in raid 1 and then when you
copy to that you got the data on two
drives and I think that's important okay
um I'll part from the hard drive so you
of course want an SSD I don't build
systems these days without an SSD in
them so this will be for your operating
system and probably also as a scratch
disk since you're only going to get one
in here this is a sandisk 240 240 gig
SSD plus and get this for 7124 again a
budget option that be x 100 that i
showed you in the first build would also
be a great choice there's lots of
inexpensive 240 gig SSDs but this is one
that I've used before and it does a good
job let's let's get down to the dregs
here when I was running out of money and
I just needed to find stuff that worked
we have a DIY PCF m18 dash BK black case
this case is probably pretty god awful
but it's about thirty dollars and again
gets the job done so it's black it
doesn't have any fancy like gaming
features like LEDs or lights on the side
or a window which is unnecessary no
painted interior but hey it's $35
probably not much in the way of cable
management either
this is going to get the job done you're
gonna have a but you also have lots of
drive support there at the top and that
kind of thing I did want one feature
from this case which was USB 3.0 I
wanted that on the front panel because
it's useful for transferring video files
and stuff like that so yeah twenty 2799
with seven dollars shipping that's
pretty inexpensive granted there's lots
of better cases you can get by spending
fifty 2015 20 or 30 dollars more but
yeah staying within budget finally power
supply ebg631 600 watt power supply
originally had a 500 watt power supply
for this build I upped it to the 600
watts mainly because of the graphics
card choice I was getting pretty close
to hitting 500 watts of actual usage on
pc park pickers so i opted to a 600 watt
unit and there's 80 plus bronze at CVG
a's the cabling on these is looks pretty
bad begin who cares i don't care about
the cabling i just care that it works
because it's a video editing system and
i was showing you guys the cabling but i
wasn't actually showing you guys the
cabling hey here's a cabling tada yeah
it's pretty bad anyway so there is my
thousand-dollar video editing pc i think
this will do a really good job editing
for anyone who needs an editing system
and you can even game on it a bit and i
kind of had fun because my first xeon
build or my first xeon based system that
i've done with these monthly builds so
there you go guys again links to these
builds are down in the video description
so feel free to check those out to feel
free to let me know what you might have
changed your updated or made difference
in the comments down below and of course
don't forget to vote on the builds for
next month which is actually probably
just going to be in about a week and a
half two weeks now because this one is
so late also don't forget you can get
shirts mugs glasses at my store that's
stored at paul's high road and that's
like the video subscribe to my channel
if you're interested in more just like
it thank you so much for watching and a
big shout out to all you guys who have
joined in and said hello live because
you're great
and I really appreciate Creek right
because you're great people and I really
appreciate appreciate I'm having
difficulty talking here at the end of
