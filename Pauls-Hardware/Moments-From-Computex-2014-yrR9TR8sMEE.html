had arrived at LAX and our journey was
just beginning somehow I knew he's
training on bring us both the highest
highs and the lowest lows I had Steve by
my side which meant i knew i was in for
a healthy dose of cheerful banter but
somehow I knew that's deep behind it
cheery facade Lea black brooding
this be a trip to remember
suddenly I found myself in Taipei I
didn't know what the hell it happened
flight was just a hellish landscape of
crying babies poorly timed movies
somehow I made it I have no idea what
time it is Stevie no time it is it's 90
5 p.m. local time ok it's only 68 market
just arrived to the taipei airport hi
this is this is going to be a live
demonstration of Steve's first
experience with Taiwanese humidity we're
walking out of the airport and leaving
the safety of air conditioning for the
first time let's just watch Steve before
it's pretty heavy watches we're also
making him do physical manual labor at
the same time to intensify the process
let's watch as the beads of sweat form
on his forehead look at this look at the
look of disgust and dismay on his face
it's actually a lot more
it's only nine o'clock at night oh it's
nine o'clock at lip nuts closer to 10 i
think as we landed it thing what do you
think Steve can handle this for weeks
actually a lot like Florida yeah I'm
actually surprised exactly more like
we're very correct yeah all right
so--okay so you're alright with it yeah
okay I was hoping you'd throw a fit and
be like no I'm going home I'm going to
fight a plane to go home let's meet
tomorrow morning and see how I am okay
we're doing all right next up we're
going to find our hotel
by the next day my
Steve and I check into the hotel had a
good night's sleep water down to the
local 7-eleven
there were no SIM cards available
it turns out we might be nearly
incommunicado
I've been in Taiwan for nearly a day
digital Plaza which is a veritable
wonderland look video cards Steve Steve
there's a guy following us the camera I
don't really know what to say about this
what should we do look at you go that
way okay now you can't take video of me
taking video of you I'm taking video
this is Plato Kyle we did this last time
you started under I just you asking you
to explain what the hell we're looking
at right now I think that's a rabbit
head on top of a mannequin wearing a
dress okay so people often ask me why it
costs so much money to the treat data
from cartridge this is why because in
order to actually do something like this
assemble a hard drive and get in there
and get everything out out of there you
have to do like in a clean room with
professional equipment by faceless
unmasked drones who apparently are part
of some sort of clone army which is very
expensive to maintain a clone army oh my
god i thought that guy was real at long
last we had come to it the one thing
that one must always buy while you're in
taiwan leds purplish yes dual as you can
see they have a fine assortment up here
dual wit we've gotten multiple different
colors to replace some of the ones we've
used over this past year but we're now
when i bring it back I got some I got
some red the one thing they don't have
is green I don't know why they're out of
green just must be lots of people doing
nvidia builds or something like that but
i got a nice assortment here as you can
see whenever you get those kind of happy
about my purple my purple and i got one
of these right there one of that right
away it's looking purple ones so i would
make a nice royal build or something
like that it's gonna maybe do a DIY kit
Kyle's not making his slick I what have
you selected so far so far I got the
same one as you the double width purple
one excellent choice and I asked him if
he had double with white 120 she does oh
hey
I like this I'll take two of those
that's pretty hot thank you sir that's
pretty hot hey how much they are right
150 for those double width ones which is
basically about five bucks yeah bucks
west Manhattan pricing in the US the
ones up here are only 100 NT which is
about a little over three dollars
fantastic deals so we got more builds
coming up they will be gloriously lit up
with our LEDs from Taiwan hmm i agree
with Kyle it's a lot of hard drives hard
drives everything on the stores on cell
right now fifty percent off gone down
you're gonna love it here and today's
video is brought to you by fractal
design define r4 now in light hi Josh hi
Josh more family fun friendly time in
Taiwan goodness that's that's serious
keep it away I really enjoyed Taiwan but
sometimes you're walking around you run
across some of the shadier areas at 0
I
I didn't see nothing hey stay tuned
they've got exploring for breakfast
we're going to try out what is called
chinese pizza it's kind of like a onion
pancake there's some egg in there
special sauce bit of basil
put that basil amazing that basil thai
basil it's like an orgasm well you know
what that's like just doing a little
exploration in the marketplace over here
cuz I cals discovered something honestly
nothing makes me feel better than a good
old a drumstick I know buddy you guys
could i get some sausage shop now i met
a gigabyte overclocking events briefs
actually i press conference I were to
show you guys this super sweet
every continue this mass humilation be
overclocked to convince our is writing
you need to be sure ladies and gentlemen
boys and girls I know I haven't been
doing a ton of actual computex coverage
in my little blog video here but I had
to show you guys this look at that board
in there you know a motherboard that is
well you might recognize that logo right
there that's a tough series logo so over
there are the sabre-tooths motherboards
that you've probably come to know and
love if you are liking hey Zeus boards
on oh my gosh what is that what is that
those are all whites asus tough series
motherboards they are known as the sub
ronco right there Sirocco
portmanteau saber-tooth in a bride
they went with a military whites winter
color scheme for these they went all out
and made actual white PCBs they look
amazing and they're telling us that if
the demand is there for these that
they're actually going to be doing these
a full run and I really hope that they
do because I want to get my hands on one
of these because we've made a white
build before but I think I think we
could one-up it especially if you get
one of these asus motherboards so super
sweet
explain to me or 11
and in this cigarette I got this bad boy
that's not true at all hey why are we
always step oh ok I've known you Helen
her feel when they own you it's a love
triangle yep now i'm at the place where
motherboards are born
