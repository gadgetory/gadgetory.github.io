Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be about three often overlooked computer
accessories that I find to be vital I
use every single one of these components
or at least some variant of them just
about every single day and although I
talk often about the exciting parts that
go inside a computer such as the
processor and the graphics card
motherboard memory storage I don't often
talk about the stuff that goes outside a
computer at least beyond the essentials
like a monitor a keyboard and a mouse so
my three categories for today are going
to be an external drive connecting
device which I have a few variants of
right here a card reader which you might
think is kind of a given but there are
some things to consider when you're
purchasing a card reader and lastly the
vitally important but again often
overlooked ups or uninterruptible power
supply so let's start with the simplest
one which i think would be the card
reader now if you don't use an SD card
for anything I don't I guess you must
never take pictures I take pictures
while often video very very frequently
so recently I have upgraded from my 64
gig cards which were doing just fine for
me when I was recording 1080 to some 256
gig SD cards which are very fast for the
read and write speeds specifically for
4k because 4k uses up tons and tons of
space now getting the data off of the SD
card and onto your computer and onto a
working drive where you can have it
backed up and actually do stuff with it
like editing can take some time
especially if again you're recording at
4k so one of the things I purchased very
early on was this little USB 3.0 card
reader which is just an external unit
plugs in USB 3 and then it has a few
different reader slots around the
outside whether you're talking about
compact flash or SD or some of the other
variants that aren't quite as common
compact flash is becoming less useful
but I got that when I was using my Canon
5d Mark - because it had a CF card in it
and then SD is pretty much what I use by
and large for most everything now this
card reader has worked quite well for me
even though again it's a pretty generic
fairly inexpensive model that I got off
of ebay and I'll like this down in the
description if you're interested and the
one thing I actually do like about this
card reader is that
as a little USB like just plug on it
with a lead so I can plug it in into it
I can narrow like USB slots especially
if it's on the side of a laptop for
example and it won't block the other
slots so I thought that was kind of
useful another one that I have right
here is actually made by Kingston and
this is the MobileLite g4 and I like
this one because it has just the
essentials it's only an SD card reader
but has both the full-size SD card
reader as well as the micro SD card
reader on the other side again USB 3 so
it's nice and fast a little bit sturdier
as far as the design so I will often
chuck this into my backpack without
really considering protection for it
which it's held up pretty well so far
the one thing that I don't like about
this again is that plug because it is
fairly wide so when it's plugged in it
can block slots next to it but other
than that a very high quality one and
again I'll link that one in the
description if you guys are interested
now another option for anyone who is
looking for a card reader especially if
you're building your own system is to go
with one that's just integrated so you
don't have to worry about you know a
little dongle or something that you're
plugging in or plugging into the front
or rear USB ports on the system for that
I would recommend something like this
this is made by inter max it is the
mighty charger ECR 5:01 and it's a five
and a quarter inch bay adapter so you do
need a five and a quarter inch Bay in
there but it gives you a bunch of USB
ports which is kind of nice including a
USB 2 as well as USB 3.0 as well as a
high amperage USB 3.0 for fast charging
but then it's also got that card reader
built into it pay very close attention
if you're buying something like this
that the card reader itself connects via
USB 3.0 or even more ideally if you're
looking towards the future USB 3.1 those
are just starting to come out onto the
market as well you'll find a lot of card
readers will have USB 3.0 ports right
next to them but the card reader itself
will have a USB 2.0 connection and that
can more than cut in half your transfer
times especially if you're dealing with
large files like 4k footage being
transferred off of an SD card so there's
some card reader options for you guys
and I would especially recommend this if
you're still relying on the old USB 2.0
card reader that came integrated into
your laptop or as part of your case
because upgrading to something like this
will definitely be worth your while the
next device I'm going to talk about here
is what I'll call an external drive
adapter because if you
watch my channel and if you work a lot
with computers chances are you're going
to end up being a tech support person
for someone in your life whether it's a
friend or a family member at some points
and often those people will have all the
drives that you need to connect up
somehow and this is in particular going
to help out with older 3.5 inch drives
especially ones that have an IDE
connector does anyone even still use
those yes you'll have someone who comes
along with like a eight or ten year old
computer and they want you to pull data
off of it or something like that and it
can be a real pain in the ass unless you
have something like this so I'm going to
go from my older and less elegant
solution over here up to something that
I think is a little bit more svelte
shall we say so this was my old external
drive adapter and it came with a couple
different parts one was a wall wart just
to provide some power this actually
comes over with a little adapter here
and plugs into this guy which is just a
little on/off switch and a pass-through
and that adapter which can then plug
into this little splitter here actually
this has a soul splitter coming off of
it and that has a molex plug as well as
a floppy connector on it so the molex
plug I could use to just plug in any
molex drive and provide power to it
which is actually pretty convenient in
some situations I've used this to plug
in like a an optical drive just to eject
it and get the disk out or something
like that but once that's connected for
power then I can take the power plug
from the molex and either plug it
directly into the drive or that floppy
connector and plug it into this and then
that will pass the power through this
device this is actually what connects up
the data for the drive so it has IDE and
a couple different flavors on two sides
here whether you're looking at the
notebook form factor size or the full
size 3.5 inch one and then of course a
standard SATA adapter with full-size
SATA power and data plug on that so I
can use that to plug in newer drives
that have the SATA connection standard
and then of course just a USB 2.0 plug
that goes over there so this again in
elegant but it will allow me to take
something that's quite outdated such as
an IDE drive and still plug it in via a
USB 2.0 to a computer so I can access it
and pull data off of it and if you're
dealing with a really old system and
it's you know got problems and it
doesn't boot up right or something but
you still need to pull data off of it
connecting just the drive up to
something like
this is a great option but again in
elegance so let's move on to something
that's a little bit more practical and a
little bit more well user friendly which
is what we like to call toasters
something like this again you must be
three instead of USB two on this one and
then it's got a little slot that the
drive drops into and this one won't work
for IDE its SATA only but if you deal
with a lot of SATA drives basically you
just drop the drive in like that engages
the SATA power and data connectors and
then on the back you have a USB three
type B cable that plugs in over to the
computer and then of course a separate
power adapter to provide power and I
like this one because it's worked really
well for me so far it's an off-brand but
also has a power on/off button and I
like that just to be able to I can turn
it off while still leaving the drive in
and the drive won't be spinning and
making noise and being hot well I'm not
using it so there is option number two
option number three which is my favorite
because again just simplicity it's just
a little USB 3 adapter like this again
SATA on one side a USB 3 on the other
and it's actually got a little double
plug on this side so that theoretically
if you plug it into a USB port that
doesn't have enough power available you
can plug that into another USB port get
more power and power up the drive now
this will probably only work for smaller
drives 2.5 inch drives that are made for
a laptop and notebook use or SSDs
because they use a lot less power but
plug it in like that plug the other end
into your computer and then you're good
to go
I use this as an external drive much as
I would like I would use a thumb drive
except it's connected to a one terabyte
SSD and it's like the best fastest
external thumb drive that you could
possibly ever get except maybe some of
the Thunderbolt options that are out
there of course and I actually will edit
off of this I'll put raw footage and
just edit off of it on a laptop while
I'm on the go again that does have
limitations because for example if you
have a larger Drive like a five and a
quarter inch optical it will not have
enough power to power that so you can
eject and everything unless you're using
again a slim drive that's made for a
notebook and then it probably won't work
for 3.5 inch drives either these just
require a little bit more power and of
course
have the connection there for the older
IDE if you need that so again a variety
of options available here but choose the
one that best suits your needs and
finally the UPS uninterruptible power
supply what this is is basically a big
old battery that you plug into the wall
that keeps itself charged and then you
plug your vital devices into it and then
if you have the power go out or if you
trip your circuit breaker your system
computer will still have power that
allows you to get a bit of extra work
done or most most likely just shut
everything down properly so that you
don't lose any information or have an
improper shutdown I just got this one
during Black Friday and Cyber Monday
sales from cyber power Cyber Monday
cyber power it's a conspiracy this is a
gaming system battery backup which means
nothing gaming is just a purely a
marketing ploy for this although I guess
they're listening how long you can run
an Xbox or Playstation 4 in a big-screen
TV like you know if your power goes out
Minik no I I must continue playing video
games that's my only option let me pull
this out real quick ok so this is a
pretty typical UPS at least for home use
and you can usually get ups that'll be
good for home for around 80 to 120 maybe
upwards of 150 to 180 200 dollars
depending on how much power it's able to
supply and how big the battery is so if
the power does go out and it's drawing
from the battery how long that will
typically last so usually you plug them
in hit the power button and turn them on
so theoretically turn it on if the power
is on which isn't happening here maybe
now there we go
got hold it in for a second and then up
on the front it's got a couple USB to
our USB ports so you can charge stuff
off of that if you need to that's a more
modern addition to UPS's not much to see
other than that again it's just a big
old battery in there and then most of
the action is over here on the back
where you have for example a USB
connection so you can connect this
straight up to your computer this is
more for a situation where you have it
connected to like a server or something
like that where the server could
communicate with the UPS
if there was a power outage then the
Surtur server would shut itself down
automatically in the event of the power
outage
you can also rat your network through
here if that's something that you want
to do as well as coaxial cable and then
a bunch of plugs some that are labeled
as battery and surge some that are also
labeled as surge protectors so this is
also like a really high-end surge
protector it will clean and filter the
power that's coming out of your wall
socket to provide more stable juice to
whatever devices you have connected up
to it and that's pretty much it if your
power doesn't go out often it's still
very possible to trip a circuit breaker
by over lot over loading it with too
much stuff on there these are the
accessories that came along with and
just to close with a quick anecdote the
time that I found a UPS to be most use
most useful for me well of course is
when the power goes out and you're
working on something and your computer
doesn't shut off like oh my gosh I have
time to save or whatever but I actually
back when I lived in an apartment we had
power outages fairly regularly and the
power would go off to the entire section
of the apartment but what I found was I
could connect my modem and my computer
like you know just the computer and the
screen up my UPS had enough power to
power those and even though the power
was out to the apartment complex as long
as a modem had power you know stay still
able to get the data connection from
wherever the node was set up so I still
had internet and a workable computer at
least for you know 20 to 30 minutes even
though the rest of the power was out in
the entire apartment and I thought that
was kind of cool but that's gonna wrap
it up for this video guys I hope you've
enjoyed it did this one at a slightly
different style than I typically do I
was a little more off-the-cuff but let
me know what you thought of it hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed links
again to all of these things or at least
whatever ones are still available for
sale are down in the description and
we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
