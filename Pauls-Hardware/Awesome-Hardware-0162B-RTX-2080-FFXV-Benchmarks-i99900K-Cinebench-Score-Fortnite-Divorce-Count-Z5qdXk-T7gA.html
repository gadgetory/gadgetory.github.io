interesting
occasionally it's dangerous because its
legs will flail and stuff but and like
knock things over or what I mean ideally
no but what's dangerous about his legs
flailing his leas he's very he's a large
dog his long legs they're very powerful
they flail around they can kick things
over like your balls he says I said I
was like like knocking things over and
you're like no I said ideally he would
not and I mean I'm oh I hope I hope he's
not knocking things over but he's not
things over before and he thinks he's
small all right he does he would like to
be a very small puppy he would curl up
in your pocket and go to sleep and she
always seems so cute
no Chihuahua complex but oh you know
what I forgot to do is open my my lead
in there but we're probably starting
right now so hi everyone
hey welcome hey welcome to awesome
hardware how's it going I am going to
paste that and then strategically delete
just like that look at that look at that
URL URL ninjas all right
yeah we're like okay hi everyone welcome
to awesome hardware live show we talk
about technology computers and computer
hardware and mostly broadcast every
Tuesday evening and we stream live to
our YouTube channels
we already stream the first half of this
show which is episode number hundred and
sixty-eight - Kyle's channel bit wit so
that's linked in the description if
you're watching in the future and they
didn't check that out you should we
talked about lots of interesting things
now we're to talk about more interesting
things more technology some Nvidia stuff
some Intel stuff some fortnight's stuff
kyle is gonna be able to drink more now
since he's already completed his half of
the show it's delicious but a real quick
FYI for you guys we do enjoy a beer on
the show and we do occasionally use
adult language so don't listen if you
don't like occasional adult language
it's it's an adult show tax returns I
guess that's what we're making insurance
oh geez that horrible Kyle cover your
ears if you would like to help support
our channels and get yourself some nice
merch at the same time
check out our stores Paul sorry Burnett
is my store
sure it's mugs pint glasses mouse pads
it's all super super nice
you can also buy awesome hardware stuff
which supports both of us at the same
exact time and you can buy that from
either of our stores
Kyle stores bit wheat that tech slash
store he also has hoodies and shirts and
bottle openers and and very it's it's
fun it's fun and it's good and it's
useful and it helps support us and we
thank you for doing that
if you bicep during the show or if you
post donation comments we do appreciate
that but we will be thanking you and
replying to those in the after party
which is gonna be on Twitch at the end
of this half it's a slightly different
arrangement than we've done in the past
but people don't seem to mind it so far
so point is let's get to the news yay
all right what do we got today Paul we
have some very newsy news slow our mind
with knowledge super newsy news Kyle as
soon as I scroll down to where I wrote
stuff dad about it haha okay first off
from legit reviews and if you guys want
to check out any of these articles
they're linked in the comment section
down below or in the description of this
video I should say and for legit reviews
we have a report about a square-enix who
is the developer of the Final Fantasy
series of games posting benchmarks for
the as yet unreleased r-tx 2080 from
Nvidia what to their benchmark result
site so we have only had limited
releases and some leaks here and there
for the RT X cards we have been able to
unbox the cards and show them to you
guys physically so far but we are still
under embargo for actual benchmarks so
that makes this somewhat special in the
fact that it was Square Enix posting
them makes you think that that's
probably something thank you region of
it you know nurse and as you would
expect so it says Archie X 2080 but it's
got the 20 atti on there too
I guess I should have included that in
the title did they in their article the
article said 2080 that's what I was just
what's up come on neighthan weird this
is
yeah Nathan weird damn it Nathan fine
but anyway check out the twenty atti
sitting there on top with a score I've
not run this benchmark yet oh here oh
don't oh we're doing this by any man we
hit fast it's like a penguin I've not
run in this benchmark yet so I guess it
gives you a score not a frame rate looks
like it yeah so high quality settings
twenty atti score over ten thousand
we're dreaming the Titan V's score of
over 9000 hmm twenty eighty coming in at
80 166 which does beat the 1080 TI right
there
and all these are beating or coming
close to various versions of the Titan
that have been available over time here
it was restless down there yes all over
the place
that's 2560 by 1440 though what about 4k
here that 4k results as listed and here
again we can see that 2080 I coming out
on top by it by inducing margin there
5842 compared to 50 282 from the closest
Titan V remember the Titan V was a tiny
V cost oh he's about to ask 3000 I think
was what it debuted at when it
originally launched and it's Titan V's
Volta right so Nvidia skipped Volta they
had Pascal they worked on Volta they
they only an integrated Volta into the
Titan V and like workstation cards and
like super computers and stuff which is
cool but you know we never got to really
mess with the volt of stuff until Turing
which is what the 2000 series is based
on which has both the volts of stuff
with the tensor course as well as the
Turing additional stuff which is the RT
course for retracing turning still
$3,000 and up on Amazon and Newegg you
mean the Titan V Titan be sorry still
over 33 grams so yeah still in high
demand
mmm-hmm for that one but in either case
the 2080 and these tests is beating out
the 1080 Ti and I think for the listed
prices that's going to be the big
question for people right now who are
actually seriously considering a
high-end graphics card because the 2080
Ti is a halo pro I mean a thousand bucks
if you're lucky probably more like 1150
1200 and up
for the 2080 TI's if you're looking at
anything like right now probably through
the end of the year but anyone who's
like looking at something reasonable as
in the seven to eight hundred dollar
range reasonable which I this feels
weird even trying to say that see that's
what they're doing that's what they're
trying to make it say that that that's
reasonable it's still not but people are
still gonna buy it so we still have to
say like alright if you're thinking
about a card in that range
that's your those are your options
twenty eighty and ten atti yeah and the
twenty eighty it has GDR six but it has
eight gigs 1080i has gddr5 X but it has
eleven gigs so there's let's think about
here I also know the performance is
gonna be a question I also think the
r-tx twenty eighty is prone to go up in
price from what we think it is now and
the gtx 980ti is prone to go down in
price from here on out because i think
the video is trying to get rid of their
older 10 series supply it would be able
to see some bargains on the 1080 TI
especially after it being so overpriced
for so long last year that would be some
like recompense for the egregious
overpriced 2000 series and what we've
seen so far of course more than that
once we can talked about talking about
benchmarks at some point in the next 48
hours I can say that safely right not
sure I mean yeah that's fine okay I
think there's a red laser pointer on
your bag Wow Jensen Jensen is gonna drop
down from behind me and just like snap
my neck right off I'm pointing you real
quick real quick his gun gets Jam he's
like damn it Tom you're fired
you've got lucky this time hoop ripped
my gun was a Tom this is probably if
anything goes wrong in that situation
definitely on top all right moving on
the Intel 9000 series of CPUs which is
still a rumor at this point which is
still unconfirmed but so many leaks like
I feel like the past three four or five
episodes of this
live show as well as lots of other tech
news sources around the web have just
constantly been talking about 9,000
serious leaks when it comes to
performance they're all they're all
there
they're all either really really
consistent leakers and they're sort of
like you know they all have a hive mind
or they're all true it's it's hard to
say for sure but here's another one
sorry to say and this one I guess is
potentially slightly more legitimate
because it's a video and the video
itself is by hke pcs like in lamb and he
recorded the screen so this is it's
harder to fake something like this yeah
I mean videos certain things you can you
can fake in certain ways and I'm not
saying this is for sure but this looks
fairly legit
they're running Cinebench r15 with the
rumored I $9.99 hundred K which is 8 for
16 thread it's just going to be on the
new LGA 1151 socket and it's clocked the
5 gigahertz in this demo and he runs
Cinebench like life on camera and it
comes up with the score of 2166 that I
mentioned it's running at 5 gigahertz
it's running at 5 gigahertz so there's a
video and you know think of it what you
what you will again yeah looks pretty
legit it seems like some of these demos
for some of these elites I don't know
it's hard to say like Intel playing this
or something but at some point you have
to be like our people aren't if there's
no consequence for leaking stuff right
then that was it intentional or not this
is just pretty that's pretty how things
like that guys face was in the
reflection of the modern everything here
less people the side people don't know
who he is or anything so have you no
shame lao khene lam the score of 2166 is
about on par with a stock I 979 hundred
X which is the ten-course skylake X so
that shows you that an eight-core the
the single core performance with an 8
core is improved enough
to outperform the ten core with scaling
X also of course you get a frequency
bonus from there because it is clocked
at Foggy Hertz which is significantly
higher than the 7900 X runs at stock I
don't know what that is off the top of
my head but point being it's still
pretty impressive score of 2166 if you
want to compare it to a md5 and radec
s-- which is also a core 16 threads
scores in the mid-1800s depending on who
you look at and who's testing 1836 was
what overclocked 3d he got and there are
specific tests so that's a good 330
points behind and of course this is just
Cinebench and it's early info and could
all be lies probably all lies but it
does seem like there is some effort to
put more eyeballs on the rumors and
stuff about Intel's upcoming launch
which we still don't have any firm
release date on I don't know just to
just to keep people thinking about that
as a possibility coming up I mean the
even if you wanted to buy an 8000 series
processor right now they're they're
limited like they're having supply
issues with them so they're all
overpriced
so if they don't have to worry about
selling out their current stock then it
would make sense to hype up the next
stuff that's coming up in order to draw
more attention away from what AMD's got
going on or just get people excited
about the next generation of products
yeah Intel might be back in the game who
knows but I mean I'm ok with that
I had like a competition movie God
though the r-tx founders edition was
disassembled this is video from gamers
Nexus friends Friends of Awesome
hardware and Steve recently disassembled
or attempted to disassemble their 20
atti founders Edition directly from
Nvidia and he was unable he failed at
that test won't be able to remove the
cooler from the PCB and remove a few
elements from the cooler itself but the
cooler has a vapor chamber across the
entire base of it and it is just like
fused together in this assembly dishonor
of it's not soldered but
it is it's it's it's screwed in from the
top and let me jump further for it in
the video this top plate that has the RT
X xx atti logo on it there's a bunch of
glue underneath that well you have to
remove that plate in order to remove the
screws that are underneath that in order
to remove the fan assembly from the top
from the thin array that's beneath it
and the vapor chamber that's beneath
that so it's just it's a it's a it's a
bitch of a thing to get apart basically
yeah yeah
Steve ended up I'm gonna take the ink
into it in order to get the glue loose
enough to pull this piece off and that
allowed and we get it to pieces
underneath interesting thing about this
was it's this PCB this PCB is part of
the cooler by the way it's not the PCB
from the PCB from the GPU part is has
already been removed at this point right
but this is a full this is an RGB
capable PCB it has controls capable of
that so they potentially were designing
it with that ability in mind but then
just decided no probably a branding
decision right GeForce GTX at the
GeForce r-tx now logo has always been
green so it only can be green and that's
all we shouldn't allow people who funny
if they made it RGB but you couldn't be
red like they remove the red chili bean
and painted blue I guess pretty soon
that should be removing the blue one too
right
cinto yes but a shout out to Steve for
really hacking apart there their sample
yeah graphics very cuz I mean he he
states multiple times in the video they
don't care about the aesthetics of it or
scuffing it up or anything it's also
it's create the Assembly of the whole
thing is insane there's 70 71 screws
holding the whole thing together Mike
and he had to take apart like even
little screws which is retention plates
for like the cable coming from the from
the RGB control over to the thing you'll
be taking pictures every three seconds
to remember where all the screws go like
that yeah so so there it is
you know I was an interesting watch for
me and if you guys again want to check
it out it's linked in the video's
description
the r-tx founders edition teardown by
gamers Nexus and good on Steve for
actually getting it apart he actually
after the first video because he did an
initial video on this we're just able to
get down to the PCB so if you want a
water cool it's your okay yeah you can
remove that top cooler and get to the
the PCB so you can water cool that
that's not a major issue but if you want
to get into the cooler itself in order
to do stuff like service the fans if
they get really filled with dust or
something like that it's very
challenging the IP rating for dust for
these is pretty good but they're still
gonna get filled with dust over time if
you're running it on your computer so
that's why Steve does the tear downs and
I find them quite useful although I've
not at this point been willing to take
my fresh clean founder's insufficient
sample and like hack it apart so I
appreciate Steve doing that for for all
the people yeah let's move on oh nice
alright so you guys all like to build
computers or to some extent I assume and
you maybe have built has spent money on
computer products over time we have a
situation in the u.s. right now that
might be affecting how much you pay this
is an article from the verge an article
from the verge not a video about
building a computer from the verge more
on that later in the show oh but we've
got some tariffs going on in the US some
trade Wars I'm not going to comment too
much on the trade Wars of the tariffs
we're going to stroll past scroll past
the picture of Trump Trump here but
Monday night the US Trade Representative
USTR finalized a new round of tariffs on
200 billion dollars worth of Chinese
imports and according to the article the
impact on tech companies will be severe
and the question in my mind that I will
say is not a hundred percent answered by
this story and I'm going to
to follow up on this further later on is
how much is this going to be affecting
the cost of individual PC components for
people who are buying them in the US and
there's not a clear answer but starting
next week affected goods by this tariff
will face a 10% tax as they enter the
country and the way tariffs work if
you're not familiar is we're not
charging China anything when the
products come in the agencies the
companies whoever in the US is buying
those products from overseas has to pay
the tariffs no tariffs for the money for
the tariffs goes to the government so
that that's how that works um which
means that if you're a company and
you're selling a products and the
products you you're selling come from
overseas and suddenly the cost of your
product goes up by 10 percent because
you're having to pay attempt there's
some import tax most often that costs to
some degree and companies work this out
different ways depending on their profit
margins is passed on to people who want
to buy those products so is next week
the cost of computer components which
we've been like thankfully watching
decrease in certain areas for quite some
time I'm going to suddenly jump by 10
percent I can't tell you that for sure
right now but the article does list
several companies that are fairly
concerned by this cyber PowerPC is the
company closed most closely related to
what we talked about and the products
and that we usually talk about here and
the cyber PowerPC CEO said that these
tariffs will increase the cost of all
our products and we will no longer be
able to stay competitive in our
company's 20-year history so while we
propose the section 301 tariff action is
the greatest threat to our company's
survivability never arise now to be
clear there is stuff that's excluded
from these tariffs and that often seems
to be stuff that will like stand out the
least or piss off people the least or at
least affects their directs consumers of
products who are buying stuff so phones
for example are exempted so people
aren't going to suddenly have to be
paying more money for their iPhones or
whatever but there is a wide range so so
sorry the tariffs spare most popular
computer products like phones and
computers but a wide range of
electronics are listed including printed
circuit boards power assemblies and
computer chips so this is where I'm not
sure right how much this is gonna affect
individual products like motherboards
and processors it says computer chips
power assemblies printed circuit boards
CPUs and motherboards sounds like a lot
again a lot of components have some
element of that yes so worried
memory has PCBs we're not really sure of
this there is again linked in the
article the final list of goods and
there's a PDF that you can go look at
that lists all these products it is I
don't know how many pages long
sorry it's 194 pages so I did a little
bit of control finds on this for to see
if it specifically listed CPUs or
anything like that I was unable to
determine too much like there's another
company listed in the article who's in
having a really tough time because they
creates what's it called element
electronics makes Roku integrated Smart
TVs and they're specifically one of the
things listed is the the panels they
have the the TV panels themselves so for
companies that are importing parts that
are assembling products here in the US
the that's where the that's where the
tariffs are hurting people apparently
you know for certain finished goods then
it's okay but that makes less sense to
me because it's like there's lots of
stuff that's where the parts are
manufactured elsewhere but it's
assembled in the US mm-hmm so that makes
zero sense to me how that somehow helps
us by by doing that but right of course
I'm sure is gonna be much people in the
comments you're like no you're stupid
stuff but whatever it is best point
being
next week suddenly all of our computer
parts start costing 10% more and 25%
more by the end of the year that's that
sucks just when we started to see a dip
in prices for like GPUs after the mining
crazy idea
finally and like SSDs and everything so
yeah again this is something a lot to
keep an eye on and I tried to do a
little bit more research before the show
but I ran out of time so we'll come back
to it
maybe we follow up on it maybe well I
don't know if the prices prices do go up
noticeably I hope they won't go up like
exactly in a week because it might like
cuz you know blah to vendors still have
their existing supply that they've
already imported over I don't know I
might have to wait for that to to go
away before they start raising the
prices but either way eventually it's
gonna but companies do forecasts and if
they know an increase price the true I
mean they're not gonna wait to raise
their price there you raise it when they
know that's coming to make up for the
loss yeah yeah so anyways I will follow
up on that more and yeah I know politics
and everything that it affects exactly
everything exactly what we do I do a
monthly video on building a computer for
his cheap as possible yeah this directly
affects me I'm gonna talk about ok yeah
ok fortnight has been blamed for 200
divorces in the UK since January this is
news this is since January this news
tryna turn to get something later after
the stupid tariff news but yes divorce
nothing lighter than divorces well it's
light-hearted divorce because it's
caused by video game playing people
playing too many video games no no to be
more specific this is according to
research by divorce online co dot uk' so
a uk-based divorce website and they said
since January 2018 200 divorces have
mentioned addiction to fortnight and
other online games as one of the reasons
for the relationship breakdown so that's
kind of grouped together it's possible
that you know not every single one of
those was directly like some fortnight
addicted person who is yeah I'm spending
all the time on that but this was
information was also prior to for battle
royale being released
on mobile devices and March so maybe
it's gotten worse since then but I feel
like this is something that has been an
issue for I mean at least since video
games have been like a very common thing
there have been stories of people
spending too much time with games I
would like my memory goes back to World
of Warcraft because that was a game that
there were so many stories about but
World of Warcraft II also had stories of
people meeting on there and like getting
married yo you know there's that aspect
of it too but you know there's there's
not really a whole lot to that the
article goes over a few other aspects of
I wonder claim to my donor if it's the
gamers who are requesting the divorce
look I just want more time like she just
keeps nagging me yeah just want to play
for tonight right so I don't need you I
have not I have a mistress and her
name's Pat no no Kyle I have to imagine
amongst all of those maybe some of it
was that way just let me play video
games in peace
or we're getting a divorce that's I
never knew I could love something this
much I have to imagine if it comes to
that that it you know must have been
over an arranged marriage or something
like that yeah article also talks about
like NBA player Andre Drummond's whose
says he's hooked on the game and a
baseball player and David Price who
missed a game makes missed a baseball
game because he had carpal tunnel
syndrome due to do the playing too much
for tonight so anyway a few more things
in the article there but let's move on
once this is a little bit more serious
tech news I guess but a MD who sort of
quietly launched some new rise in laptop
CPUs with bigger graphics integrated you
something that I think a lot of people
were expecting when AMD launched their
rise in AP use originally the 2200 G and
2400 G for the desktop people like this
makes sense as a product to integrate
somehow into a laptop you're sorry you
can you really quick scroll down so I
have to see a GTI space is to be that
guy thank you
but yeah the the interesting thing here
is that AMD has not made any official
announcement about this but the APU are
listed on AMD's website directly so you
can just go there and look like here's
the page for the risin 7 version the
2800 H is what it's called yes I
understand you use cookies am d and
there it is are there any new are there
actual laptops launched already Lundy no
so that's that lease at least not that
was linked by the article so that might
be why they haven't made much of an
announcement like this is because the
products are there now but there's
really no products there really no like
laptops based on them that you can buy
interesting thing is that since the the
even though that's there's an R 5 and an
RS 7 the r7 2800 H here and the why are
they both 2800 H one of these is
supposed to be not 2808 alright
nevermind there is an r5 2600 H 3.2
gigahertz and 3.6 gigahertz for bass and
Mac's boosts clock respectively 512
stream processors on the Vega GPU which
is clocked at eleven hundred megahertz
and here is the product page for these
seven thousand seven 2800 H both of them
are four cores and eight threads
this one has 11 GPU cores base clock of
3.3 gigahertz moose clock of 3.8 and
there's the rest of the Flex there there
is a configurable TDP so depending on
the chassis it's integrated into in the
cooling solution depite between 35 and
54 watts so so that is that's
interesting same core and thread count
for both the risin 5 and 7 SKU yeah
so let me spec that slightly confusing
if you are familiar with the desktop
side of it but if you're not then I
guess
really matter but either way cool to see
these maybe we'll see some cool laptop
designs based on these and if you want a
gaming laptop but you don't want
something with an actual discrete GPU
and imagine these would be borrowed on
power consumption and everything sorry
about the dogs
it's all good
about that everything's fixed now we're
all back to normal
so yeah since they are BGA mounted ball
grid array CPUs which are meant to be
soldered directly to a PCB or a
motherboard in a laptop also known as om
there's no retail pricing provided so
that that that's the only thing that
sucks about this story let's move on
though
oh that's all we have for news short we
are going to now do another segment the
classic sword fight segment oh yeah
certified is where Kyle and I argue
about something now do it since we're
doing the slightly more truncated
version of awesome Hardware this time
around we're gonna keep our arguments a
little bit more short but nevertheless
we're gonna argue about stuff and the
first thing we're gonna argue about is
also in a strawpoll that you guys can
help vote on to help us argue decide who
wouldn't who won the argument that's how
it goes right sure
yeah okay I'm gonna postal strap hole
here cells also posting this drop hole
big big round of applause to cell
processing our moderator for being here
moderating and being awesome thanks so
also well I think about it I meant to
say this at the beginning of the show in
the beginning of your show Harbor
connects oh yeah they had a million
congratulations subscribers I just
tweeted him right before he went live ha
they're finally they're at a million and
they deserve every day no subscriber
that they have they do so much good work
there and they're just still the best
visuals in the tech game I think in the
PC space ever and Dimitri you guys
awesome
you guys are awesome we got Harbor
Canucks and they're great people too
yeah I just could ask it guys good ass
guys just love their asses they have
amazing butter succulent cheeks let's
get a handful yeah every time in 44k all
right so uh so hard you we're gonna
argue about this first of all ninja
ninja
Asian enzymes about dance on rooftops
talked about fortnight of him ninja is a
streamer and he is the most popular
streamer right yeah members oh who knows
he just everything he's a face of our
generation and for tinnitus is kind of
his game and he is being featured on the
cover of ESPN The Magazine is he getting
divorced which means he's finally made
it what never mind a tire man okay cuz
we were talking about fortnight so of
course this this is the this is ESPN -
oh okay perfect I totally I should have
your head linked up on that sorry I
should at that yeah don't mind me okay
anyway this is an ESPN tweet about it so
of course everyone in the replies is
talking about how sure whether or not a
person who plays video games is an
athlete right ESPN is is a sports
network right is it's fortnight of sport
it's eSports mmm sports that's the
question that we were going to answer
right now
hmm and while we give you guys a brief
moments here to consider that I'm also
going to go over the next question just
so we can we can back-to-back can it can
it kind of go over that and the next
question is a little bit more sensitive
you know it's a sensitive subject indeed
I'm totally not even logged into the
right account there so oh post anything
in YouTube chat if you might draw
someday then that's fine I got you
either way no big deal
okay so there's that and the question is
about the verges how to build a PC video
which as we know I would have nothing
about received a fair amount of
criticism has it been dragged far enough
or does it require further dragging
we're asking you guys to to respond to
that we have Kyle's video here
Lyle actually did this one sorry that's
a Lyle video yeah I've never met Lyle
strange you know I'm missing Mikey
we've got we've got Gregg's video here
from science studio why not subscribe to
Craig
there we go I know I didn't realize I
wasn't subscribed to him either until
like this week I subscribed subscribe
Greg Greg Greg I did too just now
alright so vote on just a second but for
now back to the ESPN thing esports
fortnight does it count as sports no
Kyle's gonna say no you say no why not
wait does like do games like chess and
checkers do they count sports see that's
the that's the argument that you could
make if you were arguing this is that's
that's where I'm going it's like okay
one's a tabletop game and one's a
digital game but if one's not considered
a sport I don't think the other should
be and I don't I don't think I've ever
seen like a chess player on the cover of
an ESPN Magazine nor have I ever seen a
chess game on the ESPN channels so I'm
gonna say that eSports kind of falls
into that category and I don't think
just because it has the word sports in
its name officially deems it an athletic
sport there are certain elements that a
professional eSports player has that
overlap with certain abilities that a
real at the true physical athlete has
like all the hard work dedication and
the time spent and maybe mental
exercises and things like that there are
certain things that overlap there but
you could say the same thing about like
solitaire or being a professional
Chinese checkers player I think there's
a difference there's a big enough
difference there to warrant set a set a
segregation all about segregation on
this show all the segregation episode
all right so I obviously then will say
yes eSports are sports and definitely
sports and I have a very basic argument
for this if we're defining sports as
something that's covered on ESPN ESPN
covers poker and you can't compare the
athleticism of poker to the athleticism
of something like for tonight if
anything for tonight requires more
athleticism because it comes down to
this dexterity and skill of fine
movement
fine motor skills in the hands reaction
times which are all very key elements in
sporting events whether you're talking
about something like baseball or
basketball or something that does
require those fine motor skills like
like golf for example so if we're
talking about something that requires
physical skill I'd say that there's
physical skill involved if we're talking
about like oh they can be fat or
something like you can have a fat person
who's really good at eSports and still
somehow be a an eSports athlete and they
don't count somehow as an athlete
because they're fat bowling motherfucker
how about look at some bowling of people
who bowled and that's a sport then you
play with a ball and you throw it at
something and you keep score with points
at everything so there is there you go
I'm gonna try to tell me fortnight's or
eSports not a sport I just I think what
all of these have in common is that
they're all competitive and require an
immense amount of training and
preparation now that doesn't mean that
there should only be one umbrella
called sports that all of them go under
I think that it's time we branch out and
have different kinds of sports there's
like the more to it where you're saying
now is that within the confines of this
argument right now you're branching out
into like I'm still arguing in my hey
the defensible grounds no no middle
ground I still don't think that eSports
is an actual sport I think it is an
eSport and that that is different than a
sport and I think I think chess and
poker should be considered T Sports
tabletops force as its sports does some
t sports eSports sports
t sports also could be like an English
thing like okay who did it better
alright let's see what you guys have to
say about this one eSports are they
sports yes or no oh oh like I win Kyle
yeah cuz you got a bunch of nerds on
your side nerds
no Dean percentage I totally like to
watch a lot of me that's every advise -
I could also poised on defense I could
also see gamers being like I don't want
it to be a sport I don't like I don't
like jockeys stuff that's associated
with sports and sporting and this Mets
ball
let's keep it's everyone's own thing
what can I have our own thing and was
part of their fake yeah it's not like an
AT&amp;amp;T commercial totally does all right
let's move on though all right so this
was all over the place this past week it
seemed like for whatever reason the
verge did a video Stephane Etienne was
the host of it and it was all kinds of
wrong it was there's nothing that
there's no way around that and there's
no way around the amount of popularity
attributed to people who are just
shitting all over this video which I was
shocked that Lyle went as savage as he
did why why he's toward the verge a new
one so Kyle did I'm sorry
Lyle his videos performed better than
any of mine have in the last six months
I still haven't I still haven't met Lyle
in person yeah I still only have to take
cows word for it on his attitude and
everything he's a very busy schedule but
I'm just using these as examples
there's Kyle's video there's Greg over
at science studio who also took it upon
himself
Greg's video is great too you should go
check out Greg's video if you haven't
seen it yet as it has more views than
mine more views than Kyle's just
recently break-in 400k here hmm so
that's all teetle so they this this is
ad come on Craig anyway so going over
this now to be fair here and I have had
varying thoughts on this video over the
past few days like it deserves every bit
of criticism I feel like that it has
gotten when it comes to the inaccuracies
in the video sure and I feel like gosh
who tweeted it I don't know gamers Nexus
initially brought it to my attention
with the tweet okay because they were
may also calling out one of their
editors for saying that tech youtubers
are not journalists so here's here and
here's where I feel like some of the
some
viciousness I came in came in on this a
little bit to my mind now the question
we're asking is has it been dragged far
enough and you guys are we've already
posted that link in the comment for you
guys to to vote on the second up so if I
want to if I want to take devil's
advocate which I was kind of looking at
it from yesterday because like like if
he didn't say that
the dude who may notice that video did
that's did not tweet the nasty thing
about youtubers aren't journalists sure
he's just a pawn in the hole so scheme
of things so taking that like stupid
thing that that dude tweeted who is a
who is one of the I think he's an editor
and at the verge yeah and he has deleted
that that that tweet because he realized
it was a stupid tweet and Steve called
him out on that tweet too taking that
and then applying that to this video
makes your reaction to this video so
much more dimension worse so much worse
because if he if Stefan had come out and
been like you didn't used to percent
journalists let me show you how to make
it how to make it from and then when you
end up into this like that that would be
so much more horrible so it's still the
internet and it the response would still
be and it might be hard to distinguish
which group had seen the tweets and
which ones had in true so I wanted I
wanted to bring this up first of all
because I want to hear guys his opinion
on it but also because I just I just
wanted to know if anyone else got sort
of a feeling like I did where after I
feel like four or five days of just get
I like I have people tweeting me like
you need to make a video on this video
about a horrible it is right and and and
lots of there there are other reaction
videos to it besides this video the
video itself has been taken down here
what are you doing he's like brought
this whole bed to my foot and he wants
to be closer to that burrowing
sweet boy right carry on oh I got so
anyway what do you think Kyle should has
it been dragged far enough that's just a
wee question we can quickly answer here
should we cut this off or should we
cancel it continue I'll give my honest
answer here and I think yes let the
suffering end okay I think they got it
tenfold what they were expecting to get
I didn't even think that they would get
the amount of response that they did
now of course Lyle and Greg and other
other contributors probably helped
propel that forward whether it was their
intention or not but I think that what
also initially sparked a lot of
controversy was that they at some point
disabled the negative comments and they
also disables and likes and dislikes
which made the video even more
misleading to new builders who might
have stumbled upon it I mean it's the
verge they have to two plus million
subscribers they've got to be a
reputable source for all kinds of
information and that's just a bad thing
to do in general if you have a video
that's tanking or that's getting a ton
of negative negativity on it right
turning out meds and disabling likes and
dislikes but is not gonna help ya it's
just gonna show that you are aware of
how horrible the video is right and so I
think a lot of that negative feedback
finally did something good something
positive which was all leading up to
which was having them finally remove the
video because the video is now taken
down so that's good and I think now that
the video is down we can sort of just
let it go I think they got the message
and it's it's not it's done put it
behind us okay now I obviously have to
argue for know they deserve additional
mockery so everyone's fun everyone
should go and post on all of the verge
articles comments it's like all the
verge articles about other stuff should
just have comments about this PC video
women's rights if they can play sheep
like in a year from now I want to see
people just trashing the verge because
like remember that BC how to build a PC
video you guys tried to do is terrible
the internet never forgets assholes
never in
never gonna go away but alright let's
let's see what you guys have to say
about that one
it hasn't been dragged far enough not
good by a landslide you guys just don't
let it go the internet you hold more
grudges off of hatred you know daddy's
for let the hate flow through you
channel your hatred itself into you like
this is this is like a it's like a study
in in framing a video right yeah framing
a video what do you mean screaming
framing a video is what you're supposed
to do you know and I'm not talking about
art by the way the videos that are like
artistic and stuff I'm not talking about
that yeah and talk about a video that's
supposed to be someone watches video and
they learn something from it or they
they get something out of it
framing the videos that happens at the
beginning hey guys welcome to my channel
um today I'm gonna do a video about this
like right like yeah you give some level
of expectation for its coming sure if
this Verge video had been stefan coming
out there and being like hey guys i
built a couple videos before i've built
a couple computers before you know let's
build a new one here's how much I spent
and it was more of a like learn along
with me anything like all you had to do
is like there's the phrase there's some
very simple changes that could have been
made to how the video was phrased from
the get-go and you couldn't fault them
for yeah and then you'd be like okay
that's fine but no to bundle Authority
and then they could have made a
follow-up video after he got all the
feedback and be like alright guys you
guys so anyway they're this I guess
that's why we do tech videos about
building computers and they have done a
few of this but yeah thank you all for
your feedback on that and that pretty
much wraps it up for a third fight and
for my half of Awesome hybrid there it
