Joey he swings you know he's more into
the submissive types it's cool he likes
a gentle touch messed up messed up face
something for the for the damaged the
damaged people you know damaged Souls
tell yourself that even you don't know
the love that we share it's true we're
the it's real for the bodily secretions
I believe we're alive to YouTube oh hey
hey hi everyone and welcome this is
awesome hardware episode number 151 to
be specific it's a live show we stream
every Tuesday evening to twitch TV /
awesome hardware we also stream the
first half of the show to one of our
channels in the second half to the other
channel so we did the first half this
week on Kyle's channel bit wit so the
link to that is in the description if
you didn't watch you can watch it and it
was pretty good I thought I thought it
was good it was pretty good yeah amazing
now we're gonna talk about some more
technologies we're going to continue to
drink a few beers quick warning we do
drink beer on the show and we
occasionally use foul language not like
all the time but just an adult language
warning for you guys who might be
sensitive to that thing we don't want to
offend anyone and of course if you enjoy
drinking beer and you're of age and you
can drink responsibly then go ahead and
join us if not have a having tall cool
glass of water or so dare
perhaps lemonade iced tea whatever you
like you know we're not gonna we're not
gonna try to tell you exactly how to
live your life if you enjoy our shows
and you want to help support us and also
get yourself some awesome merchandise
and check out our stores Paul Sartre
Brent excuse me Paul Starr Burnett is my
story and I have a bunch of shirts with
my thumbscrew logo on them there's also
also some awesome Hardware merch if you
order that the proceeds get split
between me and Kyle since this is kind
of a it's a collaborative effort that we
do with the show got a new metallic
silver black lightweight lightweight
hoodie limited edition so buy that
before
it's all gone through mugs bottle
openers it's all real nice stuff Cal's
store is bit with that tech slash store
and you can also buy stuff there yep
desk mats shirts wonderful wonderful
high quality merchandise you can wear or
drink liquid additive or use to drag a
mouse across yes people are really
enjoying the desk mats so they are these
are real nice smooth estimates I
appreciate that the the edges of the
desk mats or stitcher are stitched they
honor which very we can't tell there but
yep you know like the best mat that I
was using for so long to build systems
on that's where that's where it started
to fail is just the corner started to
roll up right and once that starts
happening phrase and it just looks
tattered and an unkempt this is true so
these are good they're good anyway bye
is that all the intro stuff that we
should say I think so thank you yeah
nice job covered oh we didn't talk about
what beer were drinking cow got to here
today yes I did this is from slow brew
reggae red this is a red ale it's 5.6
percent alcohol by volume this
one-of-a-kind ale was born at our brew
pub admits influential musical acts of
California's 90s reggae movement a
harmony of seven different malts three
types of hops and a dash of hemp seeds
California piece makes reggae red a
crowd-pleaser and I'm drinking an Al
Smith nut brown it's a really good rap
yep it's a deep mahogany and color it's
rich malt forward flavor profile
balances notes of this mild cocoa and
earthy humps delicious mmm
all right hmm let us continue so good
with some news about technology yeah
that's that's that's all I have to say
about that
first off on would say an article from
WCCO Tech this one's from Hassan WC CF
Tech often deals in the rumors so this
is in the rumor category but the
information is derived from a fairly
legitimate source this is about Intel's
8 core 16 thread copy Lake s CPU the
has been rumored and has now appeared in
the sighs soft sigh software database
for likes I saw Sandra and that kind of
thing eight cores and 16 threads would
be two more cores and four more threads
then you can currently get on Intel's
mainstream platform with their six core
12 thread 8700 K trying to keep up with
rising and yes this is obviously very
directly a response to rising because
right now on the mainstream AMD can say
like oh well you can buy a 2700 X for
$330 we take cores in 16 threads and
that's more coarse than threads then let
you buy the 8700 K for yeah which is was
like 400 bucks
tighter yeah 300 is at least I'm late I
haven't looked just recently but there's
a core race going on yes corn thread
race and of course for people who know
their stuff there are some benefits to
the 87 okay it's got better per core PCE
performance it can eke out more
performance from a graphics card and
specific CPU limited situations so it's
not like it's a blow-up but marketing
perception is huge for companies like
Intel and AMD that's why they've been
had this ongoing war with their
different naming schemes for their
chipsets that's just driving us all
insane because we can't keep them keep
track of them true and so inevitably
Intel is going to launch an 8 core 16
thread to copulate processor on their
main stream platform this will probably
align with the new chipsets that they're
talking about which you're going to be z
390 a refresh a follow-up to the xethru
70 boards because the accusation there
is that the xethru 70 boards which
launched in 2017 were rushed and so just
in the past month we've had like h3 7d
and like be 360 whatever hack that one
is yeah we've had these like secondary
the lower tier Intel chipsets launched
as well but they have actually had some
better features than Z 370 not
overclocking because you got to have the
Z series chipset for overclocking with
themself but Z 390 should allow you to
have overclocking have
data features like USB 3.1 gen2 10
gigabit per second and I think there's a
few other bits of new spice sprinkled in
there as well but this is just a little
bit further evidence that that's
actually happening the specs or that it
was running at we're just the base level
specs because that's what's reported by
the size soft software so 2.6 gigahertz
base clock is what's reported also 16
megabyte l3 cache and 2 megabyte l2
cache for 18 Meg's total there's no
naming scheme according to the article
attached to this processor so we don't
know anything beyond 8 core and 16th
read copy Lake and then the article also
speculates a 95 watt TDP but that is
100% speculation by the article they
just said no word on the power range of
this part but we can expect 95 watt TDP
who knows who knows for sure if they'll
rate if they'll scale it up or not for
the additional cores and threads it
could be either way but stay tuned for
that maybe there'll be a more concrete
information about that at Computex which
is just a couple weeks off now
next up though cry rig oh yes
good old cry rig has announced a frost
I'm sorry the dogs are gonna bark a
little bit or whine a little bit here
Keurig is announced a frost bit and that
two cooler as well as the c7 RGB so
here's the frost bit cooler Wow
here is really really going at it right
thick hero hero salmon the dogs bark
like I could normally holler at them and
get them to stop but if I hollered at
them I'd be hollering right into the mic
it's always a challenge here Oh Shh and
every time that do that I'm like I
should just lock them out of the garage
but they're like oh they're so nice a
guy like you're too much of a softy I
know I like yo chill in here they are
pretty cool chilling here but I feel
safe and secure when they're around
sorry for the dogs guys I appreciate you
guys deal with that know if they keep
doing that I will lock them out that you
here's the frost bit no plate frost bit
so like a big ol
any fee MDOT two heats with a copper
heat deep it ends ends like a thin array
attached to the heat pipe this actually
kind of reminds me of of there is that
the only picture of it here's a better
picture of it
the little stacked heat pipes for MDOT
to to so this is for the hottest of your
MDOT to nvme drives that friendly you
must be overclocking as well I mean when
it comes to things that you put on top
of an MDOT two drives this does look the
most like like like actually means
business well UK does have a water block
for em - that's true that's true
might be a little bit more effective
this reminded me of the old ocz memory
that they had ocz made some memory that
they had a huge to go but I'll show you
yeah well I'm a TV at 3:00 but the heat
pipe came up off of the heatsink and
went over the top of the memory and
there was an additional fin array on top
of it - so there you go I guess what's
the latest Samsung in the 917 917 Evo
and fro and then 70 even on Pro maybe
that maybe those can make use of that um
we also have the c7 RGB and this is just
an RGB update to the c7 c7 being they're
tiny little cooler ITX cooler I mean you
don't have to use it an ITX situation
but low profile still does an adequate
job of cooling it's 12 volts RGB that
they've added to this so not addressable
what's what's the TDP on that cooler
I forget no wait specifications details
okay a hundred watts under Watts so they
so they now have three variants of their
c7 the standard one this one that's RGB
and the copper but it's not proper
version that they released so can can
can we get a copper one brother GB is
yeah that was meh follow up that's what
I'm holding out for then make it happen
probably okay baby
maybe at Computex 2019 it says oh yeah
both products will be shown at Craigs
Computex booth at nine
exhibition hall oh I know the non-gang
exhibition hi l27 I hoped you said
beautiful can't wait to check it out and
precise swing by there and I think I
have an appointment them but usually
they don't you just stopping by
yeah all right next up until my car I
have launched 96 layer TLC mend flash
light as well as 64 layer Doctorow ulc
so talking about how many bits per cell
there is and this image actually is a
pretty good example of that SLC
single-level cell which could basically
store two states yeah basically one bit
of information so you could have a 1 or
a 0 2 bits per cell allows you to have
each bit in four different positions 1 1
1 0 of 0 1 or 0 0 triple level cell TLC
allows you to have each bits in 3
different positions which means you
suddenly have a 50% increase in the
different states that it's capable of
maintaining qlc then also adds another
33% on top of that with 4 bits per cell
so you can see that this isn't just
about like going from 1 to 2 to 3 but
actually it's it's this is why the
increase can be more than just going
from 3 to 4 so going from 3 to 4 is a
33% increase not a 25% increase like you
might like you might assume for example
so yeah both of the companies until an
my crown have also created one terabit
qlc memory dies so that's a 33% increase
in the density that they were able to
achieve with TLC and and that will
hopefully mean in the future that we'll
be getting some much more capacity
patience capacitor capacitor spacious
space capacity to us staying in capacity
Deus
I know it's capacious their capacitance
and I can't remember which one's right
one of them is just not evil or word
capacitors capacitors I would go for it
I think that one sounds cooler
Suns all right I'll go with point being
they can stir a lot of shit lots of shit
can be stored this actual product from
micron the 552 10 ion is a 2.5 inch
standard size 7 millimeter thick SSD so
for you guys at home yes it would just
fit into your standard computer as it
took my family strap this is an
enterprise level drive though so
unfortunately no prices are listed I
would expect maybe it's expensive and
there's also no further details in the
article when it comes to durability of
this new memory as well as speed of this
new memory and specifically when they've
got SLC to TLC from one bit to 2 bits a
three bit per cell you get more storage
capacity but you get a drop-off in
performance and also drop-off in
durability which means how many times
that cell can be rewritten over and over
again right which is important for SSDs
and especially enterprise level SSDs so
these might have really good capacities
the ion 52:10 series is going to start
the lowest capacity is 1.9 2 terabytes
so just shy of 2 terabytes per drive and
it's can scale up to seven point six
eight terabytes
that's capacities that's you know
competitive with with mechanical hard
drives right now you know to scale up to
eight terabytes and now we're seeing
maybe 10 and 12 terabyte drives so I
don't want to know how much one of these
costs yeah eight terabyte SSD with this
memory big question is gonna be cost but
because they're increasing the density
per die that also reduces the price so
it might be more reasonable than we're
expecting hopefully possibly maybe and
yeah we still have to wait to see like
what the actual performance is going to
be these drives will be well suited to
the consumer SSD market where right
endurance is much less of a concern than
the enterprise space and cost per
gigabyte is a crucial crucial metric for
most consumers so that actually
indicates that apart from this
Enterprise Drive that they're they've
talked about here
this does seem to be something that
they're gonna be targeting at consumers
so hopefully we'll be seeing much faster
I'm sorry much higher capacity SSDs on
the market soon based on these and
hopefully though they won't be crazy
over priced hopefully they won't have
like really crappy rates terabytes
written stats on I'm ready for high
capacitance SSDs for the consumer yeah
level I want I want like a six terabyte
SSD nvme drive already I think we're all
ready my wife is home so this time it's
not a false alarm in the meantime though
we are going to transition over to our
next segment which is of course sword
fight sword fights traditional long they
revered segments we've been doing for
very long at the Shepherd sword fight
it's where Kyle and I take take opposing
sides of a controversial topic or
subject and we argue about it and we
also provide you guys with the straw
poll that you can vote on and you can
you can vote on the straw poll or you
can wait and hear what we say and then
vote in the straw poll or whatever and
then we'll see who wins
yep that's awesome I'm ready I'm ready
to debate your ass
so we're soon we're very soon going to
copy Tex we are this is all true Cuse me
in fact we're not gonna be doing awesome
hardware for the next possibly three
weeks we're we're we're maybe gonna be
doing an awesome hardware from Taipei
but I have a feeling it will be at a
completely random time and maybe even
not on the right day yeah because if we
wanted to do it at the right time we
would need to do it 8:30 to 4:30 a.m.
yeah my on Tuesday morning not the first
day of Computex not which is that happen
no but we're staying in the same hotel
so maybe maybe we can do one early on on
Monday night or later on Tuesday or
something like that so sure
well we'll tweet about and let you guys
know but coputex coverage CES coverage
if you guys watch our channels you've
maybe seen some of our coverage before
and this tends to happen a couple times
a year at least
when these shows come around we go to
the shows we do coverage at the shows
usually it results in lots of videos I
usually post a couple videos a day when
I'm doing the show coverage cuz it's
just it's very dense there's lots of
that's the stuff to talk about and
everything so question here overdoses do
you guys even care about that like is
this is this all waste of time or not
and money waste time money we shouldn't
even bother with it cuz nobody really
cares about the coverage context and CES
so go ahead and vote on that if he wants
and in the meantime Kyle and I will
argue I'm gonna say yes it's a great way
to learn about new and upcoming products
that's my argument alright a bold choice
how do you launch is at Computex you
know yeah I know because there were no
good lunches at CES this year which
means that all the manufacturers all the
vendors were saving their good stuff for
copy tax so this is the event to go to
this is the event to cover this is where
all the hot hits gonna come out and blow
our minds okay this is how we am this is
how will this is the first sign of next
year's trend cuz yeah there's always a
trend every year every copy text there's
a new trend like two three years ago it
was RGB and then a year after that it
was tempered glass everywhere was more
RGB and and more RGB it like RGB had
infiltrated into more - more components
than last
they were like maximum our maximum our
jury so this is the year of like
ultimate maximum super RGB which we
don't even know what that's gonna be
like so I mean I can't even predict it
no you can't it's just it's an animal
that can't be tamed and yep
you can't can't wait to see it so yep
commentary obviously I disagree Computex
is a grueling hell week of constant
video bombardment to the same booth
coverage from 8 different youtubers and
8 is conservative one thing I've noticed
more and more youtubers going to cover
the Coptics every year um you know used
to be good cop detects run into maybe
one or two other youtubers now it's just
like forest is a forest of youtubers
they're all going around making videos
bunch of young whippersnappers with
their cameras and they're talking
meddling kids how dare they piping's I
did I do it you guys at home right
innocent sitting all you want to submit
or entertainment some information watch
a video about some technology from time
to time
suddenly you pull out your phone you
look at your fee they pull it out
notifications you're like oh my god
copies X there's just this the spam of
information there it's like that's too
much it's too much to even even that
even assess and understand and try to
discern one from the other you start
watching them just get involved in the
playlist and suddenly you're it's like
3:00 a.m. you've been watching Computex
videos for like 16 hours straight sort
of continuously doing lines of cocaine
so you can just stay awake and alert
here I just came charging in like he was
doing something are you
we've all been there obviously and
that's just something that I don't
really think the people at home should
be subject to or force to go you know
it's they have to deal with so that's
why it sucks know what nobody should
actually care about subtext I do I do
agree with question 3 though that the
jet lag
afterwards I'm not looking forward to oh
look it's awful specially since we'll be
in Asia coming
coming back from from the Asia area over
to the US area western United States you
go over the the the dateline and
Dateline NBC for about a week and a half
two weeks afterwards just every
afternoon and about three or four three
or four in the afternoon you just
suddenly feel like you've been up for 48
hours straight and I'll clammy
yeah he turns into zombie your body just
shuts down and you're like no I'm gonna
stay awake and fight my way through soup
there's no way then you wake up and
you're like you've slept through for
four hours and it's like 10:00 at night
and you're like what what do I do now I
don't what it yeah shit like sucks I
posted a vlog after the last Computex
last year and it was it's the vlog story
at 4:00 a.m. we're getting breakfast
let's see who won ah you won yeah 69
percent - hey magic number good number
see see come became that's good I'm glad
and I feel positive about that I know
some people do get a bit undated but
overall I think it's a good experience
and I really enjoy going to Computex
yeah it's a good it's a good time
looking forward it we get to see a bunch
of good tech friends we gotta follow up
who would win a fight meerkat you by
sheer mass and and evilness call me fat
let's put it to the test let's do a demo
I realized we've never actually asked
this question so I feel I felt like it
was something that we should put out
there to people right you went first
last time so I'm not gonna let you go
first again but obviously I think I
would win a fight see Kyle is you can't
you can't determine Kyle's nationality I
feel like that's what that's what is
your right treating me right now
hidden skill is be like you're not
exactly sure what you're doing with so
it's like if I was going to fight Kyle
what style would I possibly use you know
did I use the dragon style
Tiger style I doing every knows jujitsu
because obviously it's a it's a game
it's a counter bounce you have to do you
have to determine what's proper what's
the proper response in order to counter
the attack and everything well that's
where I feel like I know all's be has
the advantage over me so I know all
martial arts I'm although MMA although I
have been trained in in the ways of the
of fighting and I'm very deadly and you
don't want it you don't want to mess
with me
I think I would win I would I would just
bring a gun I think and any go just
bringing okay well because I know that I
wouldn't be able to win a fist fight I'm
too peaceful of a person is arguing very
arguing for me then but you but you
would win if you brought a gun oh no
yeah okay all right fine I guess I have
to argue for me yeah that's how I would
win is I bring a gun and pistol whip
your ass but that's really the only way
that I could that could fend you off but
this that's not the gun isn't part of
the question okay then obviously I would
win all right
oh jeez how would I even argue me
winning a fight I argue do were you
winning already okay so I'm gonna argue
that you win that's okay you're right
you're right sorry Paul wins hands no
sorry I remember certified think the
answer is you I got this I've been here
I've done this before I swear I'm
professional Paul would win because he
is bigger faster stronger and harder in
in in many ways I have always been a
pacifist
have been a very peaceful non
confrontational person I'm very
sensitive constant option and against
conscience and III get upset even like
you know killing bugs and stuff like she
she wants me conscientious objector yes
I'm conscious a conscientious objector
that's that's what I am so I would say
Paul would totally smoke my
you know I probably I was gonna add a
fourth option that the fans would win
which I'm siding with them really but
hey there we go all right we are now to
the segments of the show that I have
been looking forward to for quite some
time it is
mail time yes and we have gotten like a
bunch of stuff we have for action a
bunch of stuff to open so this one's
from an extra PC right lower thirds oh
hey I got a 64 gig USB Drive it's USB 3
what for my instructions for using extra
PC identified the boot menu key for your
computer what is this is this like a
kill stick is this gonna kill my whole
system insert it and then navigate to
file explorer open the extra PC buck
drive double-click the executable file
follow the instructions and what does
this do I'm scared though I'm freaked
out to know new life for old computers
it says Nuala it says extra PC new life
for old computers to use I'm gonna look
this up extra for anyway PC
website for anyone out there all right
what does this do
found a found USB is is like a very very
common hacking technique yeah and of USB
having direct physical access to your
computer is a security risk
big time I have no idea what this
company is or where this came from or
why they're asking him to load it up and
run an executable off of it it's
possible that this is legit on some
level but I would not trust this at all
built on that version of Linux it
bypasses the old slow bloated Windows
operating system to make your PC into a
blazing fast high-performance PC with a
new simple to use operating system that
has the familiar look and feel of your
Windows PC it even works with missing or
faulty hard drives since it runs on USB
stick your existing computer is not
altered and you'll have access to all
your old files you simply plug it in
restart your PC to boot into the USB and
start using extra PC extra PC is easy to
use and made for speed it will also send
all of your sensitive and personal
information to a updated cloud that's
privatized on a secret hideout database
and will certainly be used to exploit
against you and and blackmail the shit
out of you and your likeness I don't
know I wish I could I'm just gonna wipe
the drive somehow on assistant I don't
care about I wouldn't I would never plug
that into anything unless I was making a
video about it alright if you have an
air gap Fleck if you have an air gap not
network connected laptop I have a
ten-year-old laptop that you want to
plug it into and see what happens then
sure that's fine it's very sketchy it's
just even the sticker on the USB Drive
is like printed out with like just a
laser kiss pretty even if this company
makes some software or somebody somebody
that's supposed to go and help which is
possible they have a YouTube video I
don't have I have zero I have no idea
what's what extra PC is or whatever
even if that's the case this was mailed
to you they could have duped all this
stuff taking the exam yeah put something
else on it yeah you have no idea very
sketchy thank you for the very sketchy
gift whoever said that all right this
was sent to my PO Box which is for three
to five foot three model for three to
five thousand Bar California and I went
some was expired by the way this is from
Brandon Brandon Gigi from New York but
I'm gonna hear a letter looks like what
Angie I don't see any white powder
anything says hey pop I just want to
know if you have any extra GPUs or SSDs
or hard drives can you send some please
if you can't it's okay just send back Oh
from Brandon Thank You Brandon it's okay
Paul it's okay if you don't have any
free hardware you do not I get asked
this all the time but it feels actually
feels a lot more like it makes me smile
when it's actually a handwritten letter
yeah that that is something authentic or
the sort of dilemma that comes along
with disposing of hardware that we can't
use ourselves anymore but we need to
find a good use for yeah it's not always
easy but we do try to find unique ways
to make use of it from time to time so
true but Brandon I do appreciate you
sending this letter to me I've got some
stuff here what do we have oh hey I
would say mag connects more of these
more USB Drive magnet looks like a
magnet keychain okay that's interesting
there's a quick disconnect s binder
Microlock there's a little mini
carabiner for your keychain that's cool
a nano torch which is a mini flashlight
it looks like how do you engage that oh
it's already kind of like oh good shop I
dropped it I dropped it broken no it's
fine how do you actually figure that out
what's it supposed to do it's a delight
it's a like twist to turn on it sets so
should be simple enough instructions
and then there's a magnetic key hanger
so someone's just giving me like a kit
to hang and and keep my keys all in
order key smart with tile smart location
I do have a tile I already have a tile
this is a key smart time oh that's cool
never lose your keys again that's active
mexicana use any car remote little light
yeah yeah it's handy um cool looks you
can you can attach several keys to this
little key holder is the key smart and
then it's it's tile enabled so if you
lose it you know you can just ring your
tile and it'll beep or whatever tell you
where it it where it's at if you lose
your keys often get a tile there like
there's you lose your keys or if you
lose your phone yeah either way as long
as you know at the same time because
then you can use a phone to find your
keys or you can use your keys to find
your phone yeah that's actually a really
cool gift thank you very much who ever
since that there was no name as far as
itself alright this one is from i'veeen
at 13 and it comes from Puerto Rico I
mean at 13 in Puerto Rico

the heck is that peculiar package I
think it's a bottle of beer
I do not look like a Puerto Rican drug
lord shut up you look like a Puerto
Rican drug war especially when I'm
opening these packages here the sauce oh
yeah looks like wait let me let me see
that knife after you careful the bottom

just great to me I'm scared paper dolls
I'd hey Paul I found my old AMD FX 6000
MDF on 64x64 thousand plus aces AE and
SLI motherboard and four gigs of ram
what is some they send them your way to
add to your collection didn't test them
to see if they're still working but they
were when I stopped using them hope you
can use them for something it's an F X
50 and an 88 and SLI motherboard Wow
I used to have this motherboard oh wow
this is C n PS that's where the
old-school circular ones for the Nvidia
is like the end of course old Zalman
copper lines for this is a thread of
already included the motherboard manual
for the AV and SLI that's that's look
how small that is Jesus that's a cute
little cool plate three topper heat
pipes here we have oh wait the CPU is of
a fan doesn't even spin the CPU is not
in a box or anything those pins are made
up so you fell out or what but it looks
okay that the pins aren't even bent I
don't know how that's possible
I mean so here we go there needs to be
some other hard thing freshen up against
it 264 FX 4000 and he said he's not sure
if it works you're not they said I was
working the last T check okay so
there we go here breathing cool and you
have a cooler to cool it with you have a
new HTP yep
half the parts for a new HTPC fall well
this is B so B like a retro test or
whatever if this the power efficiency of
this is just horrible now oh wow
got some debut in there the aid and sli
with the ddr - yeah dude here - yeah
installed so that's what are those two
or two gig dims this ocz Kent 3200 a one
gig bin so there's 4 gigs of ram all
four gigs of memory in there which is a
lot for that wacky pipe going from the
the chipset to the to the veeram alright
already cool thanks for the wall you
know you hang that up in frame it's like
a boss I could add that to that up there
with the d fi LAN LAN Freddie Don cell
thank you so much for sending this over
I find it good to processors give that
knife nice me to processors there's this
one in here yeah and the one in the
socket and there's the F x64 yeah I
didn't realize that okay so here it is
an old CPUs okay this one's from Russell
Russell s addicted PC in Chicago okay
it's barely light fairly light
perfecting this size
let's see mr. Russell sent me addicted
PC hey hey girl hey OH
what it's oh my god this is so cool me
ask you about what this thing holy crap
so this is DS light up I'm guessing yeah
these are all these are both RGB ends
wow that's hot sauce it's a pretty
heavy-duty image sleeve it's got a
sleeping on it where do you do not plug
it in yeah can we yeah we have your
whole new setup here oh no dude we'll
just automatically probably need a
jumpers power supply hold on
looks like there's a four pin LED sweet
oh oh and the fan just immediately
turned on yeah well it's no it's already
jumper okay
so probably not gonna I'm guessing it's
not gonna light up unless the the
controller is yeah yeah what is it
somewhere they have just a four pin
cable and an expansion slot I guess yeah
do you have a motherboard no I've been
dealing with lots of different RGB or
the cable mod if you have a cable mod
cable kit with the SATA SATA to four pin
RGB header that would work yeah
controller would be ideal - if you have
the kit
who's the controller - yeah I mean this
is a beefy ass cable though I didn't
know this existed
have you seen this cable or somewhere
before Lake Nona you remember
yes no I have no recollection and that's
pretty sweet though but I might have
something lying around but I don't so
you'll have to do a video on that in the
future okay
all right well that's really cool thank
you again I wish I wish I knew people
who sent us these things we could give
you guys a shout out and stuff that's
really cool very very neat gift all
right next up from from Willy we're in
northern Carolina wait a we have another
package tree which is heavy
ohyeah but I have one main one left this
one hola from Santo Domingo Dominican
Republic Olof Dominican Republic that
just came from South Carolina
I hope that both pong Cal enjoy the
number one beer in the dominican
republic on the next awesome hardware 3
elegans prefer to drink beer when the
beer is dressed as a bride literally
speaking you confirm this with a
commercial I put a link to YouTube video
just look at YouTube for Kazhagam
Presidente
for the first results of the list best
regards a dominican family living in the
USA alright or why not beer I got lots
of beer today I really enjoy and I
haven't sheep my p.o box in like two
months so that's why I have some new
stuff there was water there's at least
one package for today that would have
been returned today if I didn't go
really is President day crazy then
individually alright so cool alright
from the Dominican Republic nice
Presidente beer we'll have to give this
a shot so it looks refreshing probably
not today but we will hang on to this
and the next time we have beer here
we'll try this out yeah and thank you to
the dominican family living the other
saints have this over and then I would
say I saved the biggest one for last
no this package is fairly huge but it's
even heavier than it looks
this is from bearded axe sauces and
marinades I actually looked this up
online and found nothing so perhaps this
is some sort of you know home project or
whatever that the person has sent us I'm
gonna cut away from us so I don't kill
us but it's a very heavy package it's
probably
it's a good 15 to 20 pounds very heavy I
would have to imagine that there are
sauces and marinades in here based on
the shipping label actually the entire
box is covered with with packing tape
yeah like they didn't just tape up where
the box closes along the edges right
they covered the entire box
yeah yep they know how clumsy I am they
were thinking ahead okay so that's why
it's good feeling bad with how dull my
knife is oh it's doing the job if you
get down to the serrated part its sharp
okay
I think we're good here we go bump bump
bump bump
oh wow to be very well packaged sauce
sauce in a box and expected to arrive
this is true even sound oh wait hold on
is it sauce though or is it beer I mean
either way I'll be happy because I like
bow your sauce Oh double Charlatans
double India Pale Ale that's beer that
is so beard double dry hopped Wow 60 Ivy

like a magician Wow
gone so whoever sent this thank you from
the bottom of both of our hearts the
buying US beer trying to bribe us with
the arils will get you everywhere
exactly and you you know the way to our
hearts is really through our liver
can we try all those all right we have
tons of beer now last package here comes
from England's last package and you know
what that means
appreciate that Adrian don't tell me
what to do
Oh Adrian well is this that's my
assumption over Sean yes oh the big
that's an awesome all right effing
awesome twitch says we have zero viewers
right now yep alright so Oh Adrian
Adrian longtime viewer he lives in
England he has sent us fudge on multiple
occasions and every time he sends it
we're like oh my gosh that was so good
it's always so we're so thankful please
never send a smudge again not like
please like we say that to be nice cuz
like you know it's not that good for you
and everything but he keeps sending it
and we are and we keep eating it's
awesome so it looks like we have two
packets here hell yeah one for Kyle I
was gonna ask him and the other one for
me and Diana I told him to surprise me
with with what type of fudge to get me I
said you really can't go wrong
everything he's got me before vanilla
clotted cream fuck
that's oh my god yeah the clotted cream
is amazing chocolate fudge is a classic
and the honeycomb fudge is my personal
fave coffee and cream I don't think we
have tried this yet that's a good one
that sounds pretty awesome
we got Bailey's fudge which is the
family specific type of fudge
but of course the vanilla clotted cream
oh my gosh Adrienne thank you so much
okay are you gonna bust one open let's
try the coffee and cream yeah thanks for
the diabetes in advance yep in the
meantime we will end to my half of the
show by donations - yeah bazinga
$10 here's some money for you to get
some IPAs Paul Kyle said you loved them
last night during a gaming stream I did
I sold you out coffee
but it's creamy no I'm good fudge yes
thank God Les Mis does technically make
Adrienne a fudge packer huh fudge hmm
it's like it's like there's like weed
and then there's like ecstasy in there
sponge it's like this is releasing more
dopamine than any recreational drug
levels of any of my friends have ever
had all right um
bazinga thank you very much for the
donation you've also donated another $10
I hate you Paul after your video about
doing spring cleaning I had to search
spring cleaning thanks a lot Paul you're
now on my PI list along with Kyle
details to follow soon I like pie I
don't like how he says details to follow
soon enjoy a pie like he's like we're in
his fucking game of saw I want to play a
game I find it intriguing like I'm kind
of cured like what's next this to find
the key to unlock like will it be must
jump through ten hoops and dance around
like an idiot
that sounds just eyeball that sounds
like some great exercises diabolic a
positive
about the missing exes proposal but
thank you for giving us money so I guess
yes I try to inspire people with spring
cleaning videos cuz you gotta stay
inspired
Jessie n $10 if I send you pictures of
my rig I built for my brother can you
tell me what you think of it of course
we will it was a gift he did not pay for
it I built it because he just had a
crappy laptop with only two gigs of RAM
I bet he's very appreciative then hey
you should be hit me up for up in my PC
on Tuesday next Tuesday after I send out
the tweet go ahead and tweet me a
picture and say hey this is my brother's
rig and perhaps you'll get picked on
next episode and like I also get lots of
random tweets from people asking for
feedback here and there and I'm sure
Kyle does too
I do try to respond to those but like
with Twitter it's like I jump hard I go
on and I start looking at a couple
things and like maybe I'll be able to
reply and then I get distracted with
something else so I don't always respond
so I apologize if I don't but I do
sometimes so try again I guess if I
don't get back to you and I'm sorry if I
don't yeah same
okay doctor movie is $10 sembly question
late on Kyle's channels so I'll ask you
Paul I'm returning to the PC world after
eight years of using Mac's I need an
Intel motherboard for an 8700 K that has
Thunderbolt 3 support any
recommendations specifically with
Thunderbolt 3 support I would not know
off the top of my head I apologize but I
would say for your 8700 K because we've
seen a lot of random
rumors and stuff like that from Intel
right now maybe hold off for two three
weeks and see what the Computex launches
but what launch has happened at Computex
because you've already got the 8700 K
and you're looking specifically for a
motherboard I would expect there's gonna
be the ZZ bandy stuff that's been
rumored coming out and you probably want
to invest in one of those right and
it'll have all the updated connectivity
support for things like that yeah and
you should be able to find one that has
Thunderbolt support personally I tend to
lean towards Asus um but gigabyte and
MSI are also perfectly adequate options
I mean it depends on the board some
boards are better than others Rourke's
been good to meet you I like as RAC - I
know that pretty much casts in that
around the entire EVGA oh yeah EVGA life
you saw uses an EVGA board every day at
work and it's been someone so that's
yeah it's a couple literally take a look
at your options that come out after the
ZZZ 390 stuff launches which hopefully
it does Moshiach way enough ten dollars
why is it that when I offset my GPU by a
hundred and fifty megahertz from the
stock speed it crashes I need help
please by the way what's a good monitor
for $700 well wait a bundling Mateusz
two questions there so if you're
overclocking and you're unstable it
means that you're you reach two masters
GPU is not able to run at that frequency
yeah at least not with that additional
cooling or voltage yeah it could be
factory overclocked it might just not
have a bunch of headroom you might have
gotten a dud in the silicon lottery
there's a whole lot of reasons why your
GPU isn't overclocking as much as you'd
like it to so just do it in you know
five to ten megahertz increments until
it crashes and then maybe back it off 10
to 20 megahertz from that just so that
you can ensure rock-solid stability no
matter what application you're running
that's what I typically do but you know
100 me 115 megahertz is asking quite a
bit you should be happy with you know
even half that for a lot of cheap use
these days
good monitor for $700 you didn't tell us
what kind of GPU you have but I'm
assuming with one hundred and fifty
megahertz offset that you're talking
about an Nvidia graphics card yeah for
700 bucks I'm not gonna tell you
specifically what monitor you get I'm
gonna tell you what specs I would want
2560 by 1440 120 Hertz or better
probably hundred forty-four Hertz g-sync
support and then possibly HDR if if you
can throw it in there that's that's more
of a maybe yeah looked at easier asus
for those yeah my samsung as good
monitors to bed and cue has good reason
yeah if it is an antique art okay RM for
four or five three $10 false heart falls
hardware you mind looking at this build
and suggesting changes we'll be using to
stream video edit and code worth waiting
for
thread ripper second generation instead
of 2700 x will by july ish if not
there's a link there i can't click the
link or even click blink I'm not sure
I'm scared I'm scared to click link to
let's do it no wait it's not it's not
working you didn't copy it I did I
thought I did Oh God happening it
doesn't you need to put the dot between
the tiny on CC good lord
Beauty part picker oh well good
2500 X just X force thank God it wasn't
like some fishing linkers you know
there's lots of websites that will that
will preview shortcut links for you I
know no you know fuck it we'll do it
live Wow alright double check that the
memory is compatible with the with the
CPU I am because you you're not gonna be
a hundred percent sure on that because
its 16 gig dips and you're gonna have a
slightly lower you need to kind of know
what you're doing with the system to
know if the parts are appropriate 400
gig course Aaron Neutron SSD and a
crucial MX 500 one terabyte SSD and a
three terabyte hard drive and a 1080i
nfn Tech's Eclipse p400 I mean it's a
high-end build what was the question he
just wanted us to stream video edit and
code we're waiting for second thunder
per second gen instead of 2,700 X if
you're talking about July ish then that
might be closer to 300 per second gen
and the kit you're talking about when
well
you're talking about 16 kids anyway
video it's a very it's a very good
question
you'd have a lot more cores and threads
with threader per second Genet than you
would with the 2700 X but you pay three
four five hundred dollars more for the
CPU and probably a hundred bucks more
for the motherboard so yeah you're
paying more for that 2700 X is gonna be
great for editing an already the system
you have laid out here is really
high-end very solid lots of cores and
threads and it will kick ass so if
you're ready to build the system then go
for it
why are people saying frozen oh this
froze again guys weird so weird how
inconsistent then that's been it
happening a couple times on Cal's half
and no just once on my half bizarre m87
30 dollars and 37 cents Paul I thought I
heard that you're going to spend time in
Japan either before or after commie tax
if so anything specific you want to see
while you're there thank you sir
mr. lenticular yes I'm gonna be spending
some time with my wife in Japan before
Computex Cal's gonna be spending some
time in Japan after Computex sort of
poet it's weird that we both play in
these trips and independently by the way
specifically we're going to kyoto and
osaka so we're looking for some like
less big city type environments we're
probably gonna go some shrines and stuff
like that we're definitely seeing the
robot the robot restaurant in Tokyo cuz
they're spending the last couple days
there we're gonna join em we're also
supposed to do Mario Cart drum you drive
around Tokyo in a Mario curtain bar I
don't know the details but we're
supposed to try to do that too so it
should be lots of fun I'm planning to do
probably just a very light vlog of the
trip here and there I'll probably just
grab some clips and there so I'll
probably share a little bit of that but
they'll just be leading up to the
Computex stuff the the week following so
I'm very much forward to the trip I've
only been to Japan once but I really
really had a good time so looking
forward to going back cool pub Shepherd
$10 high pot pie pile hey pop hi Paul
and Kyle had
try to do a show with new guests each
week I am on s two of mine 46 episodes
so far one episode every week I'm about
to do a second show with expert guests
to show weekly fun pollen I don't really
have special guests on here unless like
one of us is gone and sometimes we'll
have like a special co-host to fill in
one of our places but we like to keep it
simple and you know if one of us is gone
and we don't make it too big too big of
a deal about it and we'll just you know
postpone the show or whatever we don't
like to set that precedent because I
feel like once you invite one person on
the show then sometimes it opens the
floodgates and everyone's like hey why
didn't I get invited and it just becomes
complicated it's kind of hard to explain
unless you're familiar with with that
sort of that's or thing but um yeah you
know I Paul and I love each other very
much and when two people love each other
as much as Paul and I do you there's no
one else in the world who can really
compare and so we never want to
jeopardize that relationship it's much
simpler we may never have guests yeah
easy this was very easy all right Dexter
2 4 3 3 $5 do y'all ever toy with lytx
just for grins I tried once then they
scared me and I went back I went back
crawling to windows yeah running back to
windows barely you know it's not to say
that I would never jump into Linux later
on but for now Windows is doing
everything for me just fine
you know I don't know if I ever want to
get into Linux I'll probably hit Lindell
up and have him teach me all of his
everything he knows become a Linux
wizard me too but um I plan yeah Falcons
fans 1979 $5 I have a 500 gig em duck to
SSDs my main drive but I have quite a
few spinning hard drives and I'm
wondering if I if I was still benefit by
getting an op Tantra
it depends what you're doing optin has
really good responsiveness which upend
for certain tasks that are tend to be
tend to lean more towards enterprise
space or like a server it's pretty
effective chances are you're not gonna
see much of a difference with most of
the tasks that you're probably doing on
a standard home desktop computer if
you're comparing an opt-in drive to a
500 gig MDOT - especially if at nvme if
it's an nvme drive in particular it's
you know you're not gonna see much
difference yeah that said opting the
drives are really nice there the
performance is awesome
numbers are really great it's just in
order to take advantage of that you need
to be doing specific use case scenarios
which tend to lean more towards the
server side then yeah consumer side and
like the 900p I think is is the one I
thought I would recommend but someone
that I actually got Wendell suggested
that one 905 oh no now if I was a new
one another how does anyone 9rp is semi
new but Owen has incredibly good
endurance and really good write speeds
whereas the smaller like the 800 800 2 P
or whatever 850 or 800 P those are kind
of trash from the reviews I was reading
that don't call me but do your research
hey long $5 Master liquid light ml 120 L
or stock Wraith prison for an r7 2,700 x
at 4.3 gigahertz binding clearance in
mesh if I see four radiator tweeted
y'all a pic for reference probably
doesn't see the pic but yeah if you have
the option of the ML 120 L
definitely I would go for it yeah you're
not paying a ton of money there I always
get like servin on the fence feeling
when it comes to the liquid cooling /
high-end air cooling market because I
appreciate some of the well you avoid
some of the potential failure points of
a liquid cooler by going with a high-end
air cooler and you can get high-end air
coolers for 50 to 70 or 80 bucks that
would do a much better job than the
Wraith
that said liquid is the most efficient
way of evacuating the heat from the CPU
so the master liquid light ml 120 L I
have one over there so it's a nice
little cooler and so that's a nice
upgrade for you especially a few
overclocked so yeah put it in there hi
love
make it happen TV ciao b-but you have
ten dollars I was on the gym today using
the men's bathroom the men's bathroom is
right beside the women's per usual I
walked out of the men's bathroom brain
farted and held the door from my gym
crush so you held the door to the men's
bathroom open for your gym crush well if
your gym crush was a guy I'd say that's
appropriate but assuming that it's a
woman you done fucked up sir that must
have been a bit embarrassed you can you
can no longer attend that gym you must
cancel your membership immediately and
transfer over all that personal but but
they be hopefully hopefully your crush
your gym crush appreciated the gesture
of you thinking about them because
that's important to a lot of people and
even though we again we're not sure
where they were talking male female or
you know what I'm making assumptions
here but hopefully they appreciated that
you were thinking about them and I think
that oh that's great
he wants me to walk into this room full
of dicks what a guy
no the thought was that like you were
saving them the arduous task of opening
a door as we know is very challenging
for lots of people opening that door is
really doing it for them she may have
had no arms could have been a
life-changing experience Thank You TV
ciao thanks man ten dollars well the
only man ninety-nine ten dollars
hey Paul or Kyle have you ever under
bolted a laptop GPU on a budget gaming
laptop is there any performance game
Long Island man ninety nine it's a
little subjective what you're asking
here if you were able to under bolt a
laptop GPU and at the
time increase the clock speed which
might be possible with a certain number
of laptop GPUs that are very tolerant
for that yeah but you know overclocking
is a your mileage may vary situation and
every GPU is a little bit different so
right yes in some very specific
situations with the right GPU you might
be able to under Bolton overclock and
then yes you would see a performance
gain if all you're doing is under
bolting and maintaining the same clock
speeds you'll see the same performance
but you'll see less power usage and
probably less heat generated so those
are the two benefits that you may get
from under volting yeah you have to test
that to see what's what but thank you
for the donation there mr. Long Island
man
Andrew Andrew Squire five Canadians okay
GIMP for picture manipulation but for
video editing would blenders video
editing be good for a freemium editing
program I've never used blender - did
you from my understanding blender is
more of the 3d rendering tape program
right and video editing program yeah
I've heard various things about Vegas
video editing let's see though what's
the cyber media cyber media made a video
editing program that they were trying to
get some uptake on that I heard was was
okay but yeah I don't gonna tell you I
don't know that I think Vegas is usually
like the not Adobe Adobe suite option
that I hear people editing on that's cos
a lot less what gets the job done and
right I haven't used it myself but I
haven't heard anything terrible about it
so probably just fine maybe it doesn't
have all the features of Adobe of Adobe
but um yeah you buy as a starter
freemium I'm not sure like our YouTube
anything like you can upload to YouTube
and anything that's up that's horrible
don't try that out and talk to you
pentacle i don't know i would do some
research i haven't really looked into it
so i hadn't either
I apologize Andrea which we can give you
a better answer I'm sure there is a
decent premium one though yeah then
we're out there it's gotta be rent rod
nine zeroes to six five eighths
that's my father-in-law oh my exotic
thank you
donating $10 to Paul minor stakes yes we
are no longer family so you're putting
your money where your mouth is and he's
just donating - is he kidding clearly -
his favorite child who your favorite
tech youtuber is it's me I feel betrayed
cell why are you donating money to us so
thank you for your $5 donation you
should pick it sorry for being late he
was in school hey that's fun fight if I
had to fight you guys I would bring a
Gundam Kyle a Gundam Kyle I'm hoping to
see the Life Center life-sized Gundam in
Tokyo I heard there's a full Sun yeah
you know be fun yeah that'd be cool the
scene photo op but thank you so thanks
man we should be paying you hopefully it
will never have to actually fight to the
death
yeah atomic age a 74 $50 Paul sorry I
missed your donation last week but your
wife Oh
buy your wife some flowers or whatever
it is miss mrs. Paul Paul's hardware
loves well I will thank you atomic KJ I
know she loves pizza and I know we're
gonna eat meat too soon so that's what's
on you for that yeah
Steven held $20 hey Jen Steve all I just
finished my first nass using your guide
as a baseline in this guy fantex case
you may be familiar with are you
planning on doing an ass video update
with the Corsair 1000d both of you fly
safely thanks man
Steven yes I am giving the NASS up and
running in the Corsair 1000d I'm
actually very much looking forward to uh
excuse me that because for one - hasn't
been up and running for several months
now which sucks it's mainly because the
USB drive on it died the reason I don't
have that one up and running is because
like for a freenas main operating system
drive you can run it off of a flash
drive so it's getting like a really
high-end SSD or something like that
doesn't make a whole lot of sense I'm
actually gonna be using an MDOT to drive
for that build even though it's not the
most practical thing to spend money on
but I'm not gonna like try to I don't
want to drop in at 480 gig MDOT to drive
in that so I'm getting 120 gig of course
there I'm about to drive to put in there
but it hasn't arrived yet so yeah I
still have some work to do on that but
I'm gonna get it set up and I will do
continued videos on it and setting it up
and
yeah I wanna I want to be able to turn
off every single computer I own except
for that mess and have that on to have
remote connection for data storage as
well as running the plex server to do TV
to like record TV and stuff that'd be
pretty awesome yeah one build to rule
them all
next we have binary grind $5 I want to
get into the arm you get emotional I
think that's a repeat Oh binary grind
high-rollers I want to get into VR I'm
looking to pick up a set up soon if you
had to pick one now which would it be
HTC vive or oculus rift well I still
like HTC vive yeah I'll get ripped it
has made some some strides to to catch
up but I still like HTC vive I like the
whole room experience and they like BOTS
even though there's a lot to set up with
the light boxes and everything I like
being able to move around and stuff I
feel like that's the coolest part about
VR yeah I agree
Jay Bailey five dollars I just bought an
in win ce6 8 5fh 300 TP 3 with a 300
watt power supply
how are the power supplies in those
cases they're actually pretty good in
when used to make power supply is a lot
more than they do now and from what I've
heard they're fairly reliable and have
usually an 80 plus rating there they
don't skimp on their power supplies last
time I checked so I would imagine that
they're ok I would look up reviews
anyway just to see but I feel like they
they are very proud they very proudly
stamped their name on their power
supplies and it's not though it's not 80
plus rated though is it not oh it's not
in the specs as far as I can tell I'm
yeah I was saying that with like their
higher-end cases in mind the ones that
are like $500 plus I didn't realize that
this was a more budget it's a $100 like
HTPC case which I think
with the built-in power supply do you
want 300 watts honestly though I mean
like for like power supplies they're the
type of product where like you can
critique the crappy ones and be like
this is poorly made and it might have a
slightly higher higher failure rates
right but there's you know if your
failure rate is 8% instead of 3% then
they're still gonna be 92% of people who
get that power supply and use it and
it's just fine so a lot of people who
buy this type of system what's a 300
watt power supply aren't going to be
putting a huge load on it for this type
of build yeah and it would probably be
fine as well true it's Brian I can be
super crazy high end 80 plus gold rating
with all the highest end capacitors and
stuff in there yeah you might not be
getting the greatest efficiency so if
you're really concerned then maybe look
for something that you could swap that I
would agree with that
mosha Aquino's once again $5 i have a
gtx 1080 and I'm thinking of doing a
custom loop any tips and would you maybe
like to do it if I sponsor a video Roche
hard to say about the sponsoring the
video thing because we get lots of
requests for that but if you're thinking
of doing a custom loop with 1080 I would
recommend if you've already got to 1080
and it is a founders edition or at least
the founders edition PCB that will give
you a much wider range of options when
it comes to GPS that can go on there and
there's even more options now like EK
has like their that's what's it called
they're the aluminum the aluminum kits
that they know yeah
liquid gaming i forget what they call
that serious but yeah i forget to
there's there's there's lots of kits you
can buy and stuff that you can get in
there and look with cool and brand get
yourself up and running and if you've
never done a custom loop before then
those kits will kind of give you
everything you need and so there's a
little bit less to worry about as far as
the details go yeah it's good for
beginners so that's maybe what I would I
would point you towards but yeah
that's luck this there's there's lots of
ways you can go when you're liquid
cooling so
I hope you have fun GG alright how long
how long five dollars I'm not the best
with thermals knowledge thank you for
the insight if y'all see my tweet soon
thinking of throwing the radiator on the
rear panel spot hmm
okay I don't see any issue with that
neither do I probably only get to fit at
120 back there whatever case it is again
needs more information but um good luck
Halen fat guy fun time $5 having an
issue with getting chroma cam to work
something about it needing virtual
drivers do you guys have any experience
with chroma camp I've never heard of
Chrome weekend before what is that
neither am i I have no idea
remove your background with a green
screen ah software so maybe you're using
it for twitch streaming for example yeah
I don't really have any experience with
that I've done all my green screening in
the past with After Effects but that
wasn't live after you graduated so OBS
you can also do King with I believe but
I haven't done it so don't even know so
I can't give you any good advice
fat guy fun time I'm sorry yeah sorry
about that man I tried crap okay good
luck though I'm a chroma cam chroma keen
we do appreciate your five dollar
donation though Jordan chart Jarrod
although he gives you nothing in return
oh yeah Jarrod and Clarke by now $20
Paul how effective would the ukulele
implant be it cooling a CPU probably
minimal there's and there's not much
actual fluid transfer that's going on
there it's all self-contained so you've
probably set it on top there it would
absorb some heat but then it would warm
up and then then it would just be an
insulator I think yeah
Harris by civic $5 question on student
bill I will be doing a CAD I will be
doing a CAD modeling for which I would
like to be able to do stress analysis
and simulations using my models help
okay
if you're doing CAD modeling and
recommends you want more memory you also
want more cores and threads on your CPU
so consider a 16 gig memory solution
maybe there
two gigs if you can afford it and I
would look at something along like a
2600 X or 2700 X right now yeah yeah and
and just even like a high performance
gaming graphics card would serve you all
if you really wanted to go full
workstation and you're not gaming at all
then the quadros will work too and this
can be a little pricier though No yeah
yeah okay okay let's move on goober will
Cooper would $50 hey guys build my first
PC last week I follow Kyle's build head
and Paul's BIOS windows head and
everything worked great thank you guys
so much awesome by the way DaVinci
Resolve is a great free video software
oh yeah bob is free so you could you do
all your editing through resolve if you
want it to person who asked that earlier
it's a good good good tip there Cooper
would thank you very much Moshiach clean
up once again $5 did you guys watch
Deadpool 2 yet yes if yes what are your
thoughts I have not watch it yet I
haven't seen it don't spoil it for me
trap I'm not looking at chat anymore and
that's it
Johnson twitch raid alright let's do a
stuff yeah do we have any Johnson maybe
one or two I have oh my gosh I have
quite a few actually
Shane smart thank you very much for
picking up a beware of bottlenecks dark
gray Heather t-shirt and a BIOS flash or
heavy mayo wow you bought like three or
four things and I got and then Samson if
we're thinking up a desk Matt yay I'm
gonna use the restroom Riley now damoff
Johnson Riley got a couple decals thank
you so much to end jobs into you Riley
Paul I like your name Paul from
Australia oh my gosh metallic silver
Heather charcoal lightweight super honey
I think you might be one of the few
first people to have ordered that one
also the stainless steel bottle opener
thank you so much Paul and a Johnson for
you
William be from Pennsylvania got the
metallic silver having Heather Navy
lightweight hoodie the limited edition
one you're you're gonna be one of the
few people rocking that one thank you
William
oh wait don't clicked on the wrong thing
John John s from Texas these Star Wars a
navy t-shirt and the thumbscrew decal
thank you and Johnson to you John
wait where's the next thing okay here it
is
click Anthony see from Arizona the
metallic silver Heather Navy lightweight
hoodie thank you Jensen T Anthony I
think that will keep you warm but not to
work it is a lightweight hoodie after
all
Kevin Kevin L from Colorado got the
mousepad and best mat set as well as the
two glass pub glass set thank you Anna
Johnson for you and Shane s from Wyoming
got the oh my gosh
lightweight zipper hoodie gray and black
silver men's black tri-blend t-shirt the
awesome are more Star Wars shirts and
the thumbscrew gaming desk mats Wow lots
of things many many things
thank you any Johnson for you as well I
think that's pretty much gonna do it for
my half of the show so this is usually
the time where we tell you guys to go
and do a raid so let me see so yeah
that's where can app sub processing our
awesome moderator usually lines is up
and yes he has so if you guys are
watching live right now and you're bored
and you don't have anything else to do
then go over to twitch.tv slash luna
lyric that spelled LUN a ly are I K Luna
lyric once again twitch.tv slash Luna
lyric LUN al why are I K go over to Luna
lyrics stream and tell Luna that that we
sent you kyle is checking that stream
that way aha she's painting paintings
and positive vibes and drawing she's
currently has 29 viewers so she's not
she will hopefully you know notice if
she suddenly has more than that but guys
if you enjoyed this video of course the
coasters button is thumbs up button as
always if you didn't watch the first
half the link to that on Kyle's channel
is down in the video's description if
anyone wants to do timestamps we greatly
appreciate that always post those in the
video's description and we will pin you
but make sure they're accurate don't try
to fool us like that one guy did that
one day yeah yeah yeah we see you
we're keeping our eye out for that yep
this time and finally red Luna and
that's all have a good night thanks guys
