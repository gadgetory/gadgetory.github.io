Oh my lovely wife it's just Paul's
hardware is now who just entered certain
building okay we should be live like
just about now you know momentarily yeah
it looks like we're left
hi everyone more or less welcome to
awesome hardware this is a live show we
talk about technology computers computer
building PC gaming other related
subjects as well as nonsense
occasionally we discuss nonsense but we
scream every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware we're streaming live
there right now and we're also streaming
to my channel Paul's hardware this is
the second half of episode number 174 of
awesome hardware this live show we have
been consistently doing except when
there's holidays or CES 2019 that we
just finished with actually we've been
kind of on hiatus for a good month now
yeah because of Christmas New Year's CES
but we're back thank you guys for
bearing with us thank you for watching
us live we have lives you know yeah
whether you're watching YouTube or or
twitch we're glad you're here feels good
to be back and we're glad to be back we
spent the last week in Las Vegas and
that was an experience too long it's
always an experience it's a long time to
spend in Las Vegas yeah but you know
you've got CES to kind of distract you
so you're not spending the entire time
you know gambling at O'Kane and the
hookers and yeah speak for yourself
you're right actually there was no
cocaine or hookers there was some
gambling bit of drinking some delicious
food a bit all that's covered in my
final CES vlog which I posted earlier
today I want to get home no gate also
unless they say yes we did bit we turn
it was nitwit with Kyle
yeah celebrity edition I was pitted
against Luke as well as Steve Luke from
last tech tip Steve from gamers Nexus
yeah just destroyed both of them just
flat-out okay kind of proved wait for
the full episode to launch on YouTube
tomorrow maybe maybe you guys
you just wait for tomorrow before you
you decide but other than that's a quick
plug at the beginning of our show for
our stores if you guys want to help
support us and get yourself some
SuperDuper extra high quality merch
check out the stores I have a limited
edition black lightweight zipper hoodie
limited edition this is the lightweight
one by the way I was sort of I was sort
of off earlier when I thought the one
I'm wearing is not the lightweight one
you know like me although they're both
very nice
I do have heavier hoodies also available
down below that's the charcoal
lightweight one this is I've got some
pullover ones first of all I'm wearing
this is the one this is the one I'm
actually wearing right now this is the
dark gray zipper hooded sweatshirt nice
and everyone should buy at least at
least two at least two but palter
Burnett is where you can find my
products and then you can also find
products at big weight optic big bit wit
duct tech slash store designed it as a
tongue twister yeah my purpose is kind
of kind of difficult to say there but
sure it's mugs hoodies pint glasses all
real nice merchandise we get we get good
feedback on the merch because it's
high-quality
shout out to John if you're watching
he's our merch guy and he he's the best
he does a good job with that but thanks
you guys for supporting us we're going
to dive right back into some tech news I
think yay wait let me do the lower
thirds
yeah okay oh wait no I changed take it
where's your bottle opener where's the
bottle opener that you can find on
Paul's hungry done I changed the news
lower thirds that's never supposed to
happen what am i what am i doing 2020s
been a month
ready alright as announced and promised
at CES just before CES I don't I don't
know when they actually said this it was
like Sunday Nvidia today has released
their latest driver and the driver
specifically is for 17.7 one for 17.7
one and this unlocks a precinct monitor
support variable refresh rate for
GeForce graphics cards for a very long
time because free sync is an open
standard and freesync monitors typically
cost less and a lot of people were like
you know Nvidia
is a standard it's been used for
notebooks for for various things they
could turn it on at any point and a lot
of people thought they just never were
gonna do that because NVIDIA has g-sync
monitors vsync monitors actually have a
chip in them there's some other stuff
that goes on under the hood but a lot of
people like you know a video you should
just turn this on nvidia has finally
decided to do so now it's not without
some caveats they do have a validated
experience free sync monitor vetting
process and this was what they sort of
talked about when they did the
announcement at CES to sort of indicate
like not all free sync monitors are
badass like jisuk monitors by the way
jisuk monitors meet very strict and
rigorous standards for testing and
everything so nvidia went and tested
something like four hundred of the
currently available free sync monitors
they validated twelve twelve of them Wow
twelve out of four hundred were
validated now just to be clear that
doesn't mean that only those twelve
monitors can be you can support you know
free sync on with a Nvidia graphics card
you can turn it on with any frame sync
monitor and Eddie Nvidia graphics card I
don't I don't think there is a I thought
it was like ten series or max welling up
is it max well enough okay I take that
back because I didn't look at the
history there was a is there a kind of
limit maybe 900 series at 1000 series
apologies for that but I mean the the 10
series is already from 2016 so it's not
like that's I think it's 10 series
enough 10 series enough right so for 10
series enough you can turn it on and you
can go and activate it in the settings
now if you happen to have one of these
special 12 free sync monitors that also
meet the g6 standards and nvidia has as
has given the green light for it'll turn
out automatically if you don't then you
just have to go into the settings right
click on Windows desktop go to the
Nvidia control panel to display go to
setup g-sync check enable g-sync g-sync
compatible box and select the active
sync display they're gonna use and then
check enable settings for this black box
and click apply so you know
go under your G's thing to your settings
and you can do that there is also a
follow up by Nvidia that if that setting
is not available or if it's not working
you might need to go to manage 3d
settings click the global tab scroll
down to monitor technology select G sync
compatible in the drop-down and then
click apply and then it should turn on
so you got a couple options here for
actually enabling that so having a
g-sync validated Nvidia validated panel
or free sync validated panel by by
Nvidia just makes it easier for you to
enable the feature it makes it easier so
it's plug in place so if you have the
driver and you have the panel it'll just
turn on it just works which is how a
g-sync panel typically works if you have
a g-sync
like like like this one back here and
the Nvidia updated drivers it just
recognizes is like a G's ik panel right
the Nvidia graphics card cool do you
think is on right that'll only happen
with those 12 monitors a couple of extra
steps if it's not if you have one of the
other monitors you have to go and
invalidate it yourself there are certain
gray areas like there's some freesync
monitors that have multiple multiple
freesync ranges that you can that you
have to go into the monitors settings
like in the firmware and the like
buttons on the monitor to change for
that you have to let go and you have to
go still change it on the monitor and
then go update your refresh rate on the
on your computer and stuff and you can
still turn it on there are some downside
so I mean if you have the cheapest of
the cheap free sync cheapest free sync
monitors with like the bare minimum of
specifications you might encounter some
of the negative side effects of this
which is like black frames popping it
from now and now and then now to help
people combat this tearing and
stuttering or to at least give you a
better idea of like what's my free sync
monitor gonna how is my free six minor
you're gonna behave or I want to buy a
new monitor and want to get a monitor
that supports this right there is a
thread going on in
the nvidia subreddit but unfortunately
it's already been turned into garbage
where'd that go I don't link to it but I
thought it was in the start like a part
in the wind the nvidia subreddit had
created a thread where people were
starting to go and post lately I have
this monitor and I tested it with this
card and here was my experience so that
I can sort of start to develop a bit of
a compendium a sort of non official list
for people who are in that gray area
where you have a precinct monitor but
you may or may not want to turn it on
they had a shared Google Doc and that
like I'd like it was editable by editing
anyone so someone went in and like
deleted all the stuff or somebody else
went in and always one asshole posted a
bunch of offensive stuff on it or
something like that I'm not exactly sure
what happens but anyway didn't have
school that day this just the driver
just became available today so we'll
start to see people testing this with
various monitors and it's it's good news
all around to you and your options
because I think this is both going to
allow people to have a variable refresh
rate gaming experience whereas before
they couldn't afford it and this should
also hopefully start to put some
pressure on some of those really high
priced g-sync monitors and maybe bring
some of those prices down
yeah because you know not everyone can
spend a thousand bucks it also kills
some of the argument of like well buying
an AMD card because you can get it a
free sink motor for a lot cheaper than a
g-sync one you know it does and maybe in
video was starting to see that yeah be
more of an impact on people's buying
decisions right it's always hard to say
like what exactly the catalyst is that
yeah causes these decisions to be made
at the high levels that they need to be
made at like this is probably Jensen's
decision I'm just speculating
sure Mike right it's probably his call
on this maybe I don't know but anyway
good news everyone download that driver
especially if you have a free sync
monitor and an Nvidia graphics card more
good news this is this is this is what a
great way to start off 2019 with two
back-to-back good news stories yeah this
one is about further potential price
decline of
and we were talking a lot about just
tech prices in general especially in the
last few months of 2018 because here in
the US at least we have some some
tariffs going on that are you know
causing some issues but those have been
delayed for various subcategories of
products being imported and whatnot but
the point being those have not impacted
CPU component prices at least not as of
yet probably due due to the delay in the
deal between China and the US for that
and on top of that we have some market
forces just some natural market forces
which has been building over the past
year so that are causing this as well so
this information is all according to
DRAM exchange which is a division of
trend force so fairly reliable they
noted that DRAM prices had been stable
you know they had dropped but were
stable from November to December 2018
December being the end of the year and
also post the like the holiday rush
timeframe orders are less so that wasn't
a significant amount for them to
actually make a forward-looking
prediction on but mainstream 8gig models
modules were about $60 u.s. each protein
during that time period November to
December core gig modules were about you
about $30 us and that's the monthly
average in 2019 already just in the
first couple weeks of January
both eight gig and four gig modules have
already dropped below those lows so for
instance eight gig modules now are going
for around $55 for an 8 gig DIMM and
this is again averages and we're talking
about bulk pricing by suppliers and OEMs
so this isn't necessarily like I should
exactly look for that price at retail
yeah but it's sort of a an indicator for
the overall market the suppliers and
OEMs in the DRAM market say that due to
high inventory weak demand and a
pessimistic economic outlook for the
medium to long term
prices will Leslie dropped 10% month the
month in January so I'm looking at those
55 dollar 8gig dims about a five five or
six dollar drop and that trend they're
looking to continue looking to continue
in February and March so overall in the
first quarter which is January February
March about a 20% drop is what they're
anticipating and that is up from their
estimates I guess last month of about
15% so about 5% more reduction in price
and demand prices dear I'm being a vital
component of computers and one that has
caused like your your budget builds to
sort of potentially balloon out of like
proportion when it comes to pricing cuz
like ah I could go with a four gig dim
and just get by with the bare minimum
right but that's that's such a crappy
situation to be in
yeah Oh like eight gigs all right that's
passable but then I gotta buy two four
gig dims right like you really want 16
gigs cuz then you can go with a cake
dims and give yourself more
expandability option if you're going
with the system that has four dimm slots
and everything right so again just good
news if you're buying memory now or if
you're buying memory next month it
sounds like the prices are low and
they're gonna continue to get lower so
especially if you were looking at memory
over the past two years sigh of relief
there well that's finally turnaround
moving on YouTube has just changed how
to navigate videos in its mobile app
this is what may be more of a concern
for Kyle and I than all of you guys with
them you have my attention if you use
the YouTube mobile app on your
smartphone you might be interested to
know that apparently 70% of YouTube
views are now taking place on mobile
devices that's insane that's a lot
that's more than two-thirds that's not
seen more than desktop yeah so lots of
people watching YouTube on their on
their smartphones and this change is
going to going to affect iOS devices
this week when yeah it's rolling out
this week to iOS users and this is how
it works
watching a movie watching a video ok and
you're bored you have a short attention
span because you've been trained to do
that by like apps that cater to that
like this YouTube app and it's aside so
I just wait just
no just swipe no YouTube has become
tinder tinder then you just get swiped
get swipe left swipe left next video get
swipe left is exactly know where it's
that easy it's the same way if your oh
that's tuned vertical mode scroll and
scroll into the comments or whatever
just swipe to the side I mean it
increases watch time and that's genius
it's a genius move on YouTube smart can
maybe for YouTube does it help us though
no absolutely no does it help us unless
we're the one who's who's getting
skipped to I spotted people stay on a
few reactions to this comes from your
average consumer another tech youtuber
and he's he calls it a retention killer
I saw a few people pointing at this as a
retention killer I mean definitely like
hi I'm this person and thanks for
watching
swipe like what intro with five words
I'm bored
swipe dude seriously so anyway it's just
it's just catering this is just catering
to like the short attention spans that
we already have and it's gonna make them
even shorter which means that people are
gonna have to be like creators gonna
have to be stepping up their games in
like the first five 10 seconds of their
videos to like create these like
ridiculous over-the-top grabbers you
know because that's what that's what
we're headed towards you're gonna have
to have an amazing five-second intro in
all your videos or you get a fraction of
the revenue that you've been making in
the last ten years
see if somebody swiped off of this video
while you were saying that because yeah
because it was actually interesting oh
no it's not real not like me me enough
you know and they're not the weren't
enough memes in that 30 sec real the
three millisecond time span I will say
that for some reason with this brought
to my mind and this is kind of random
but like when I was at CES I only saw a
lioness once this year and I didn't
actually get a chance to say hi cuz he
was across the room doing it video sure
it was a the Corsair booth and I just
watched him for like a minute he was
recording a video and he had this thing
I don't even know what he had he's just
holding this thing and he was so like
animated like this movements around and
everything was talking to the camera
you're like I would just watch him as
like I was like that's intentional I
know that's intentional cuz we haven't
always moved and acted that way like is
that is that what's required now I need
to flail my body around if you take if
you take that video or maybe a recent
video of Linus's and you put it next to
like a video like a recent vlog of like
Logan Paul's you'll notice that they
move and articulate their bodies in a
way that is not human or natural but yet
it's kind of like watching a slow-motion
car crash where for some reason yours
you're gonna see him where this shit
goes let's see we're the ship sails too
cuz I like I've never seen anyone move
like this before
I feel like Linus is very good at like
okay the whole thumbnail thing like he
had adopted these new types of
thumbnails that were unlike anything
that was done in the tech space but had
been existing for months if not years in
other pockets of YouTube like on
vlogging channels and you know
commentary social commentary channels
he's very good at picking up on these
these tropes and the and these trends
and applying it to what he does in the
tech space and so it seems foreign to
all of us because I feel like even
though we're in the tech space it's kind
of ironic that we're sort of a step
behind as well when it comes to what the
algorithm favors and I feel like Linus
has always been sort of first and
foremost on that forefront of seeing
what audience members what viewers are
attracted to so it it's really kind of
interesting I know exactly what you're
talking about this sort of over the top
contort it looks like he's in Silent
Hill one of those nurses like you know
exactly but hey I mean I'm fascinated
chat sorry about speaking there cow cows
imitating - and you know what that leads
to
I'm China that's my my you know my New
Year's resolution not that I've said
anything about a New Year's resolution I
want to pay attention to chat that's
important to tell you things they let
you know things they do all right very
helpful
let me god gamers Nexus involved in an
insane scandal leaking coming out early
you know breaking all kinds of NDA's
with a Radeon seven
benchmark oh boy obviously a huge gamble
here traversing this being it's being
reported over unready gamers Nexus
exposed now here's here's what this
actually is this is this is actually as
a post from Steve this is this is the
original post Radeon 7 leaked a Costa
Rican youtuber with the help of gamers
Nexus did a benchmark CES 2019 without
AMD noticing in their own showroom
obviously this video has been removed
thread has also been locked and as
responded to by Steve so came across
this this is all happened within the
past 24 hours or so
so just to just clarify here there was a
youtuber he was from Costa Rica keep
posted a video from CES his name is
Michael Quezada
he's a spanish-language youtuber from
Costa Rica he made a video very not
serious very joking now I made sort of a
joking video of from CES talking about
killer robots and I was kind of nervous
that some people might not realize that
I was joking despite what I hoped was a
very obvious joke how did you kids hide
your wife so I put a big block text
disclaimer at the beginning that this
video should not be taken seriously just
to be safe just to be on the safe side
Michael apparently did not do that do
that his video I know it's sad that I
had to do that I took away from some of
the humor I would have rather not but I
also don't want to deal with anyone
coming back of course especially some of
the vendors I went to who like her
robots do not kill people that's why
like the ones I went up to where I
actually asked what it takes to kill a
man he's walked away he fuck you
he went from I'm happy to be talking to
you and discussing my products to I'm
never speaking to you again in an
instant you were no dead oh my gosh
there must be some sort of a faux pas or
something above it amongst the robotic
robotics manufacturing community it's
time he got that that day sorry again
for the clipping I know one of these
guys sorry I turned us down
sorry for the people I'm peeking
point being when you make a joke it's
sometimes helpful even though it
attracts from the joke to just be clear
with some sort of disclaimer our friend
Michael apparently didn't do that and to
his in his defense he was talking about
a bunch of stuff at the Andy booth like
he said he saw the security guard and he
waited for six hours at the AMD booth
studying the security guard and his
routine so he could later infiltrate and
get access to the Radeon seven PC so he
could run benchmarks on it which is
clearly a joke when you understand that
in context and I would understand that
as a joke as well what this is is a
language barrier type of thing where
Michael English maybe not being his
first language so so hold on okay
Michael's video is not the video that
started to blow up I looked at his video
it had about it has 70,000 views or so
so it's I think it's you know it's done
okay sure but there was another video so
somebody took Michaels video ripped it
and uploaded it on their own I'm just
like this guy in gamers Nexus with
things with the AMD Radeon seven
benchmarks and that's what got posted to
to read it so that day I started picking
up some steam I see people like oh my
gosh did did gamers Nexus actually go in
and sneak into the Andy booth and run
these benchmarks this whole delete them
out and post them in breach of NDA and
all that kind of stuff the answer is no
it was a it was someone else
32 video who Rio did Michael casados
video right with a very different and
misleading English headline right that
other people started to pull up and I
guess at some point he did make some
fake charts or something in the video so
now we're like looking at those and be
like oh you're very handsome good I mean
I'm glad you know at least spine all the
way yeah so that's that's how it went
but we wanted to let you guys know this
because gamers Nexus obvious obviously
friends of the show you know yeah they
to our knowledge they would never engage
in this sort of nefarious activity and
Steve of course posts and Steve is
active on reddit if Steven ever did
anything like this he'd be the first to
admit that he did it yeah he put he'd
never hide anything ever anymore or 5
point he'd take credit to this he take
full credit if he did anything like this
he goes over the entire we were in the
AMD suite to meet with the CPU and GPU
teams I spoke with him in a side room on
my video to team to b-roll
we showed a news video in front of the
AMD demo system anyway Steve is very
clear about your actual activities in
the Andes basically he did it so Steve
so Steve has everything's true think
it's actually Brady on seven occasions
an engine a CIO asked the audience ask
the audience so we're going to pull you
guys on some very substantive topics
here since we just talked about the
Radeon seven let's start with that okay
so I'm gonna post a strawpoll link and
chat here can you guys can can click on
that and you can you can vote on it but
basically we're down seven you know we
we know what we know so far from from
what we saw at CES you guys know what we
talked about on Kyle's half of the show
where we talked about it most likely
being a Radeon instinct derived GPU
since it has 16 gigs of HBM - and sort
of a configuration that doesn't make a
lot of practical sense for a mainstream
consumer graphics card also the now
rumors that we have that there's only
going to be something like 5,000 units
produced very limited run we're not
gonna see a Dan board partner versions
of the cards so it seems like a
specialty GPU right that said what do
you guys think of it cuz specialty GPU
were not it's providing a higher-end
gaming graphics card from AMD to provide
a little bit more competition from
Nvidia when it comes to like the RT X
2070 and 2080 they're not trying to say
it's gonna compete with the 2080 ti but
it's competitively priced against the
2080 and that 16 gigs of HP m2 might be
a compelling sort of value add to
someone who wants to game and also do
GPU compute stuff at the same time or
it's not somebody post in chat on
cutting back on Cal's half of the show
like there are
games where especially games that you
can do add-ons with like high-res
texture packs and stuff like exactly you
actually can make use of that you're
that much memory so some some more
nichkhun scenarios that that might be
useful for so that's true wanted to ask
the audience yeah and see what you guys
think of this now Kyle and I are gonna
go sort of we should are we arguing
percentage of like you know like like I
say 55% say yes it's you know yes I did
so choose a percentage okay before Carol
and I make our choices though and to
give you guys a little bit more time to
the second quarter vote on this we will
also move on and and quickly go over the
second question which is a follow-up to
CES hopefully guys we're able to watch a
decent amount of our CES coverage before
you got sick of it because CES coverage
is being spammed by many many different
tech tubers a lot of stuff but what was
missing from CES that's that's our
second question I have a few options
here I should have put a a like not
listed or something and I know none of
the above
but you guys you guys can both find
which one they're closest to you got a
few options gaming monitors I saw a
bunch of gaming monitors I was looking
at a bunch of us like a lot of these
have really good stats I still saw some
people afterwards saying like you know
they didn't have one that really hit all
the points like the the higher higher
level HDR compatibility as well as the
high refresh rate as well as the really
high resolution like a 4k or some of one
of the fancier ultra wide ones true we
didn't see anything from Navi Intel was
like oh we're still launching 10
nanometre this year I promise we're on
track
and quick there Jen risings robots that
kind of thing
yeah let's know what you think of that
okay but Kyle let's uh let's go back to
that first one okay and see what you
think Raizel seven yes I'm gonna say
give me a sec I'm gonna say most people
are gonna say no it's just a stopgap
until Navi best to pass on this one and
I'm gonna speculate that it's around 55%
55% you say yes
55% yes say no I'm gonna say maybe well
what am I saying
56% say yes okay is that you gotta do it
quickly because now that I've said it
it's on stream people are gonna start
voting accordingly they're gonna they're
gonna skew the results you gotta you
gotta take quickly otherwise it's gonna
be alright so I just I'm just gonna
choose yes I'm gonna say yes there's a
higher percentage than no okay you know
isn't quite the same as you saying the
exact percentage for no but but sure
just wasn't we didn't predetermine this
so it's true place by ear and see what
the results are okay too early
Wow too early way to ruin and then and
then most people say no we got about a
little over a third saying no yeah only
about 11% say they're excited to buy one
which honestly if I was a m.div I go
that's fine we only made 5,000 yeah
can't sell them to everyone it's all we
need so 25 we got 25 votes from the
awesome Margaery how quickly they go
through this but I applaud those of you
who are you know reserving judgment
that's important if there is a get away
for the review so there's a subtext of
like a moral or a lesson to this whole
thing it's a yes we should not make snap
judgments especially about a graphics
card that we really haven't seen any
actual performance testing of other than
the numbers that have Andy provided us
with which well we can hope are accurate
must be vetted in the long run but then
again do you really want to die and have
your life flash before your eyes without
being rendered by a Radeon seven
graphics card is that a reference to the
ray tracing
are you're tracing quote I'm just saying
that I'm just saying maybe Paul you
should just buy it well I'm gonna see if
they send me one first they send me one
for free
then maybe I'll buy one all right final
question that you guys can also vote on
before we go over the second question
this one is just a straight up straight
blood who had the best CTS 2019 coverage
now I feel bad because definitely seen
it I probably could have included more
hair I tried to go with people I saw or
who were there with me or like when I
did a CES search on YouTube the videos
that came up and everything so I know
there's some missing here yeah
absolutely
but but you got all the important I
think I got I think I got oh yeah the
most of the ones that I feel like you
guys would probably see you got the one
who some people carry about so feel free
and I think Kyle for this one you know
can we argue or no we're just gonna vote
for what percentage you and I each
individually okay Wow I'm gonna say no
you can't not yet okay oh yeah sure nice
we have to give people time okay we
can't taint there you're right opinions
you're right here the opinion of our
team give him a sec give him a taint sec
you're right guida BPS did have some
excellent coverage he I think he worked
harder than I did but all the smaller
channels do I know well the big channels
don't work they don't even anything
I mean I still I still worked I just
felt like Linus just shows up in flails
as a habit I use after covering CES for
as many years as I have I feel like that
this year was the best example I've had
of sort of you know scheduling things
right and sort of having a flow from
the meetings in different places and and
setting meetings that are more contained
in the same area so that you enough as
much time traveling Tech yes City
excuse me oh yeah I forgot to put tech
yet city apologize yeah that's totally
someone who I should have any other
Brian I knew as I was going through
there that I was like I think that all
right so what was missing from CES
though that's nice Dave question booth
babes all the booth babes obviously
there could be many more booth babes but
I mean it's Vegas there's plenty of eye
candy if you were to go and pay for it
what do you think that was missing let's
just we we use it one sure just just
pick one just pick one I'm gonna say
tech tubers dropping breaking stuff did
not see any of that I saw all of
everything else I feel like there was
some stuff with us yeah I'm gonna say
there Jen raisins just would have been
nice just cuz oh you get your vote and I
don't well I'm not gonna actually hit
both their generations cows is breaking
the drop and breaking stuff oh my god
Wow oh good guess because there was a
because there was all that all that all
that height leading up to it the leaks
quote-unquote supposedly cleaning up and
they got blue balls or Jen rising
pricing maybe a super blue I I had a I
had some thoughts on that especially
after discovering did you sorry I'm
sorry sorry headphone user sorry had a
moment of excitement body quieter um
point being though especially after
finding out that all of that information
was bunk and not true I was like you
know what I bet that was seated by not
AMD I I bet that information came from a
competitor sure because if there's one
way to dampen enthusiasm about a product
launching this at the bar high it would
be to Lee promise stuff that's over
promising that's being like well it's
gonna have all this stuff and be really
really inexpensive and then people eat
that up and like oh
so excited about it now and then it
comes out and like maybe it has really
good stats from what was before but what
stats compared to what you were told
exactly sleek like that's why I was like
you know it's already been set so I mean
I have no proof of that or exact English
I've heard some some rumors here and
there so I'm not going to much go too
much further into that all I know is
that if I was in a position where I
wanted to dampen the enthusiasm for an
AMD launched that's and and I didn't
have anything else to combat it with
with like you know what Intel's got this
that's how you would drink that's
probably the way to go because it sounds
pretty Intel loominatee to me full well
we'll see you never know we'll see and
the worst things that have been done in
the tech industry all right oh yeah
final question who had the best CES 2019
Kevin I'm gonna say 5% for me five
Kyle's getting 5% I think I deserve at
least a five I'm gonna say a good fiber
and so whoever is off by more has to
pound the rest of their beer okay which
I have two sips left do you have a lot
more to lose than I do you say 11% a lot
of percent for you for me it is your
have the Street Fighter II to your game
you're kidding to your fan base that's
fair enough and you know I probably call
all of the tech yes city you know votes
probably went to me because he wasn't
included there true so I got a very
similar to him through his altar Oh -
tech tips
- today tips they did a very good
coverage a huge team they do is it's
it's very it's very thorough the tech
link coverage as well Iman I only
watched one or two of theirs but they
had some nice compilations I mean as
well as some stuff that you know wasn't
the typical
tech coverage about you know the case
and vendors and the GPU vendors and
everything true gamers Nexus with the
solid
20% coming in strong there I don't know
what address to that at 18 yeah you guys
so very close we change her a content
strategy to be fair our contest strategy
was nowhere near
you know what we were trying to do when
I co-hosted fewer videos this year we
went for less stress more fun seen it
market which I do not regret it off yeah
zero votes wait no Austin had no I'm
sorry two votes
they probably only produced a couple
handful of videos that week I did see
ApS like I saw Austin there and then
when I was doing CES 2019 searches like
our Marquez video popped up so yeah
that's why I headed them there well okay
no penalize my beer we're happy to be in
the top five at least that's I wasn't
expecting to get on the list at all the
fact that I beat up Marquette is one of
the top tech channels in the world I I
feel very privileged yeah you should you
should use that in your I'll gladly
repeat when you're pitching like doing
ad sales for this year I'd be no better
is better than marques Brownlee alright
number one guys that is gonna wrap it up
for my half of awesome hardware hey so
thank you all so much for watching and
we'll be back again next week we're back
to our regular schedule the week after
next though we'll have to take another
week of it why what I'm gonna be gone
don't worry about it okay yeah but but
we'll be back next week so don't worry
about that shagging my Paul in the
meantime we will be continuing the after
party today so the link to the after
party is in this video's description you
know I should set it to public I don't
think I said it to public you do that no
but uh guys thanks for watching it comes
up on any where it says somebody wants
to do timestamps we'd love we very much
love when you do that so thank you for
that
thanks for watching we'll be back soon
