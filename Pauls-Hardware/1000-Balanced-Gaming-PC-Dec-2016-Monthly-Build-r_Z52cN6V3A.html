monthly builds video for December 2016
every month I do a three-part series
there is a planning phase where I part
out a couple builds for you guys and
talk about the decision-making process
that goes into that second part is where
I actually build the system I just
actually finished doing this system
build for November so check out that
video if you haven't seen it already and
then the third part is the testing phase
where I test the system out run some
benchmarks talk about my experiences
with the parts that went into it what I
liked and what I didn't like so if you
haven't already seen it again the
monthly builds video for last month the
actual build part just went up mini ITX
monster PC and then I have the follow-up
for that which should be up I believe on
Wednesday that's my plan
and then I also of course have these
videos the monthly bill they used to do
this live I don't anymore but I think
I'm actually going to combine these two
playlists to make everything fit
together a little bit better now I do
ask you guys every month for what you
want to see and the PC builds for the
following month so for December you all
voted for the $1,000 build for a sane
person balance over bling like what
would I really spend if I was or what I
really buy if I is building a $1,000
computer but now that I've explained how
things usually work this video is
actually going to be a little bit
different than my typical monthly builds
videos for one I only have a single
build for you guys today although it is
a very good one and for two I'm looking
for some additional feedback for you
guys for what to plan out for next year
because although there's a pretty good
chance I might not actually build the
system for this month mainly due to some
upcoming stuff at the very end of
December and the beginning of January
that I can't really talk about yet I
will be getting some additional feedback
from you guys as far as these questions
here looking back at my past year and
the builds that I've done I realized
that I was kind of limited in the
various case manufacturers I worked with
so I have this question which
underrepresented at least on my channel
case manufacturer would you like to see
in a future build video and I have a
bunch of high-quality case manufacturers
here that I have worked with before
just vote let me know what you think as
far as who you'd like to see me work
with in the future also in early 2017
there are some rumored product launches
I want to know what you guys are most
excited about whether it's AMD Zen CPUs
AMD Radeon Vega GPUs until stable egg
stuff or
or whatever nvidia has going on because
they haven't teased too much as of yet
and finally just as in general for my
parts lists videos what do you guys
think should be included with the
typical parts list just the core pc
components the core pc components and
the operating system which is how i've
done it today or the pc hardware the
operating system and peripherals such as
mouse keyboard and monitor so vote on
those all the links are down in the
description and let's move on to my
build for this month the $1,000 build
which i think is a great price to go for
i think if you're building a pc for the
first time and you don't have anything
else to work with and you're buying all
the parts 500 bucks i think is kind of
the minimum you should shoot for seven
to eight hundred dollars you can get a
good system for a thousand dollars you
can get some nice performance
overclocking capability better cooling
and just a better experience overall so
this system is of course featuring the
i5 6600 k which is kind of what you
would go for as far as a cpu at this
price at for a system at this price I'm
looking forward to there being some
other options besides a 6600 K I have an
inner Mac's cooler and asus motherboard
i used some parametric filters for the
memory and storage and r9 fury graphics
card a deep cool case and a corsair
power supply I've also included $30
kinguin Windows 10 license and bringing
it all to just shy of $1,000 998 total
so let's go over these parts again
that's 6600 K 220 bucks right now there
were some good deals for this on Black
Friday but about 220 is what you would
spend for it solid overclockable
processor quad core no hyper threading
yeah there's there's not much
competition at this price so get a 6600
K and look forward to next year when we
will hopefully have some Zen and KB
league stuff coming in to provide some
competition there you do need a cooler
for that unlocked processor it doesn't
come with one out of the box I chose the
NI maxi TST 40 F it's about 40 bucks you
can get some other options for about 10
dollars cheaper than this like the
cooler master hyper 212 Evo or the cryo
rig h7 I do think this one looks pretty
nice though that's got an all black
finish it does have a blue LED fan which
you may or may not like direct copper
heat pipe contact for the CPU and a good
cooler overall it's got some pretty good
ratings
slightly smaller than the old version of
that but for the motherboard I have an A
to Z 170 ATX price for this is right
around 115 220 dollars and there are
some mail and rebates available right
now this motherboard gets the job done
and has all the features that I would
want in a full-size ATX motherboard
here's the Newegg page which man no eggs
photos have gone downhill in some
circumstances you know they used to take
photos of everything and it would be
nice and big and you can see all the
details but this is just a blown-up not
blown-up picture of the manufacture
phone anyway I'm complaining $25 million
rebate card will bring this down to one
hundred and eleven dollars and it has
SLI support for two-way SLI at least
it's got an m2 slot in there it's got an
all black color scheme with just a
little bit of white accents on there and
even the tiniest little bit of blue
which I suppose would match with that
with that heat sink fan from under max I
wasn't really going for matchy-matchy
with this build but for $1,000 you you
can make some selections that will be
both powerful as well as aesthetically
pleasing now I used some parametric
filters on PC part picker
did I mention by the way PC part picker
is what I'm using to part out all these
systems parametric filters is how you
can do basically a search and then you
can tell in your build PC part picker to
say just do that search and use the best
component from within that search so
just to show you guys how I might choose
memory using the parametric filter all I
really did was choose the basic ddr4
memory speeds that would be reasonably
priced 2133 all the way up to 3000 I
want a 16 gig kit that's 2 by 8 gigs and
then I want something that's as cheap as
possible so if you if you sort these by
price the one that's going to give you
right now is this yield yield Evo
Potenza for $73 so you'll notice there's
a lot of options in the 73 to maybe 83
dollar range down here and I would just
go down these one at a time and click on
each one and see what it looks like and
if it matches this one is red and
probably doesn't match very well so
after going down most of these and
finding that most of them are colors
that don't match at all I found the
Mishkan black line so that's probably
what I would go with here it's an EDR
for 2400 and it's 83 dollars or if you
don't care about things matching
and just get the dig you evil potentio
Aquila Evo Potenza or perhaps even
something in here like you know that
reptiles 5 Series is ddr4 3000 just you
know a hair or two faster so that might
be worth going for too but that's kind
of how I would decide which memory I
want for storage I did the same thing
again remember to sort by price here for
an SSD I wanted a 240 gig 2.5 inch drive
Radeon R 3 series from AMD right now is
60 bucks
the ADATA premier SP 550 is also right
there and that right down there in that
range right around this 60 to 70 dollar
range there's quite a few options for
240 SSDs that's what I would use for my
operating system and then I would add a
2 terabyte mechanical drive to that
these can be found for very reasonably
priced less than $50 gives you a bunch
more storage so you don't have to worry
about running out of space on that SSD
and I wanted a 7200 rpm 2 terabyte drive
that was 3.5 inch size this is pretty
much what I came up with so yeah go for
that Hitachi desk star 7k mm yourself
some additional storage alright let's
move on to the memory card I'm sorry the
graphics card I chose the r9 fury 4 gig
this is the Nitro version from sapphire
available over our new egg right now for
260 dollars to 40 if you count to $20
mail-in rebate card it looks like new
egg has oh good they have slightly
better pictures for this one so this is
a three fan cooler design from sapphire
it's their Nitro version and four to
sixty this is just an insane bang for
the buck this will pretty much run
circles around like a four and rx 488
gig or like a gtx 1060 so yeah I think
it's a better option for here if you do
have a little bit more money to spend
and you want to give yourself a nice
jump up from this in performance I would
consider to consider a gtx 1070 as long
as you can find one in the 380 to $400
range that would be a nice option to let
me back to the case the deep cool do
case do cos do cos v2 ATX mid tower case
50 bucks for this case and it hits all
of the selling points that i want first
off it has good reviews so although i
haven't worked with this one personally
oh great we're back to the tiny Newegg
photos these aren't going to help
very much but see what we can do anyway
it's got a nice clear acrylic side panel
so you can see into your bill it's got a
basement down here that's covered up for
your power supply which is also kind of
nice to have even as a couple five and a
quarter inch Bay's even a 3.5 inch
external bay if you want to add some you
know an optical drive or like a card
reader or something like that
pretty nice design looks pretty clean
I've got good I owe a front USB 3 and
USB 2 and and all that good stuff
painted interior some SSD trays down
there and then you know full-size ATX
layout and all that good stuff so a
solid case from deep cool for fifty
dollars and I think this would be a nice
foundation for anyone to build a system
in at least until you got tired of it
and you know upgrade to $100.00 $150.00
case some that sometime down the line
because that is nice to do at some point
but I think that's a good case for 50
bucks finally the power supply here well
not almost finally but a close to
finally the Corsair RM 650 X it's a very
solid 80 plus gold power supply this
will last you for multiple system builds
I would imagine as long as there's not
some crazy feature and pcs that's coming
out soon that I'm not aware of but a
all-black cabling which is nice that 80
plus gold very reputable manufacturer in
Corsair and this one again is on sale
right now for $70 even ten dollars more
off with the promo it looks like there's
a promo code animal and rebate from
doing wow you can get this fruit
seriously that's including the $20
million rebate card and all that kind of
stuff anyway if this is too much for you
if you're looking for some other options
for power supplies Corsair EVGA who
makes power supplies those other power
supply manufacturers as well but they
have some good options down in the 50 to
70 dollar range again you want 80 plus
gold I would look for 600 Watts for this
kind of build and then I always like to
check the cabling and make sure that
it's pretty if possible and then lastly
now of course you need an operating
system for this build so Windows 10
Professional available from King
Wynette's for $28 and nine cents right
now people often ask me since I did my
Windows 10 for $20 video if kinguin is
still working for me all the
systems that I've gotten Windows 10
licenses for through kinguin are still
working just fine so yeah it's been good
for me but guys that is going to wrap it
up for this video I hope you've enjoyed
it let me know what you think of this
$1,000 build in the comments section
don't forget those links to the straw
polls so you can vote on the other stuff
that I have coming up this video
follow-up will be coming out just on
Wednesday so stay tuned for that as well
and did a bunch of testing very nice
little system here I'm very happy with
it so far and I like that it's portable
so I can take it to CES in January
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
