modders all over the world who have
built some amazing systems like this
Darkseid themed case by George
priscilla's showcasing the spacious
internals in the define s or metallic
acid a mini ITX system by Justin Olsen
featuring a white black and red color
scheme and a super clean layout in they
define nano s there are a ton more
awesome build like these on fractal
designs modding series page so check it
out via the sponsor link in this video's
description and get inspired for your
next project what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware this is my monthly
builds video for August 2017 if you're
not familiar with this series basically
at the beginning of every month I put
together a couple PC build parts lists
these are for you guys at home might not
be as familiar with parting out a
computer that you might build yourself
and then I usually build one of the
systems during the month as well so if
you are here for an actual build I
recommend checking out my builds
playlist and I'll link this down in the
video's description or I have lots of
stuff including just recently my very
inexpensive 525 to $550 rise in three
build which I've already built and
already tested so check that out if you
desire and also help me vote for next
month of course fan feedback is very
important for this series so check out
the straw poll for September and
remember you can choose more than one
option here I have a series of prices so
tell me what price point you're looking
for and then also different form factors
I kept this one a little bit more
generic because I'm not exactly sure
what the landscape is going to look like
next month when we actually start going
and choosing parts but who knows we're
in the middle of summer though right now
it's like August 1st literally and here
is the poll from last month and it was
actually very evenly split amongst the
different options that I put out there
at the top of the full 1080p gaming and
streaming setup with PC peripherals
camera and capture card but very close
behind it was a mini ITX rise NPC very
close by and that was a back to school
system it's portable able to multitask
you can play games so I actually
combined all of these these three top
answers are all what my first system is
and then I also have thread Ripper of
course because thread Ripper is now
announced it's launching on the 10th
code just like a week and a half people
can already pre-order them right now so
links to that is also in the description
that's me all of this is real
and hearsay of course despite my
obviously photoshopped thumbnail I have
no direct access to any of this stuff
but nevertheless I decided since we now
know that thread Ripper is launching at
the 1920 X in 1950 X coming out in just
about a week and a half let's part out a
system that is reasonable thread Ripper
now there's also a 1900 X that was just
announced it's only going to be 550
bucks it's going to be an 8 core but
that's not available to the very end of
the month so for those who want to jump
in right when thread rippers available
what is the most reasonably priced
thread Ripper build that I could put
together was kind of how I was going
about that one so let's start off
actually with neither of those builds
and just take a quick look at the video
card landscape and I'm just using PC
part picker for this like I do most of
my builds this is an exaustive for like
all the people all the cards that are
available but taking a look at cards in
the mid-range that are very difficult to
get do - coin mining aetherium in
particular the 1066 gig can be had for
280 $4.99 that's about $35 over retail
and let's see if this is actually if we
can actually even buy it for this price
this is actually a new egg marketplace
seller it appears but it's actually
there it's in stock so $35 over MSRP you
know could be better I guess
it could definitely also be a lot worse
let's take a look at the 1070 which is
also very popular the pricing is
relatively better I guess still more
than MSRP the MSRP for 1070 supposed to
be 380 or $390 but it is in stock at
least so you can at least purchase it if
you want to Radeon though you're still
pretty screwed it looks like right now
our RX 5 80s are starting at 400 bucks
and that's for 4 gig options and our RX
5 70s don't even appear to exist the
cheapest 5 70 is more expensive than a
580 so yet radians are still very
challenging so bear that in mind
the mid-range of the graphics card
market is getting a little bit better
but it's still not in a good spot but
let's get on to actually building a
system and we'll start off with our
thread Ripper system now thread Ripper
is very brand-new again pre-orders just
went up so compatibility filters on PC
part picker aren't quite up to date yet
but you can see we only have two options
at a thousand bucks and 800 bucks for
the 1950 or 1920 again there's going to
be a 1900 these 550 bucks but not
available for pre-sale yet so let's
consider the 12 core option here so if
we were building a 12 core which would
be a workstation system then we also
want a CPU cool and a motherboard so if
I choose CPU cooler because DC part
picker has automatic compatibility
filters we can see the CPU coolers that
they have determined are currently
compatible now the rising CPUs are going
to ship with a bracket in the box that's
compatible with the wide variety of ACE
tech cooler so any of the ACE tech om
schoolers that includes variants like MZ
XPS kraken series and arctic liquid
freezer as well as Corsair will be
compatible which is pretty nice
in fact over on AMD sites I'll put a
link to this in the description as well
they're having a more updated list of
what coolers are going to be compatible
so based on that I chose the master
liquid 240 for this build even though
it's not currently listed as compatible
on the PC part picker site and then our
motherboard options are also pretty
limited right now we have 5 basically
models that are up for preset right now
from a stock MSI gigabytes another a
drokken an asus and the cheapest is
asrock X 399 Taichi so I just went with
that one since it's a good 50 bucks
cheaper even at 333 dollars compared to
the other options from msi gigabyte and
stuff now I haven't directly tested
these motherboards or anything like that
so I'm just going with something that I
have a reasonable idea should should get
the job done and as rack Taichi board
that they have come out with in the for
the past couple generations has been a
pretty good board anyway here's my full
build and you can see the actual total
price is coming in a little over two
thousand dollars which is nice when you
consider that Intel's 18 core when they
launch it will cost two thousand dollars
by itself also when you consider that
Intel doesn't even have a mainstream or
non xeon base 12 core that you can even
buy right now so this is like your only
option really but let's run down the
rest of the parts we have the starter
for 1920 X 1200 processor right there at
the top of course I chose the cooler
master master liquid 240 240 millimeter
all-in-one days pretty quiet
it was only about five or ten bucks more
than the arc
version and I know this is a good cooler
so with that one as a 99 Tai Chi of
course hopefully there'll be some more
images of that available soon and then
for memory the the SSD for the video
card I went with parametric filters
because I'm not concerned as much at the
specific exact product you should go for
here I just want to make sure that
things are compatible enough so here's
our thread ripper already available for
pre-order on Amazon
there's our master look at 240 I like
the tubing for this one actually it
looks pretty nice and the fans that
comes with are very quiet there's our
list of compatible coolers again because
I'm doing these out of order
there's our as rack motherboard so if
you did want a closer look at it
big old pr4 socket right there up on top
and then of course lots of DIMM slots
supplemental CPU power because they do
seem like they potentially draw a lot of
juice especially if you go for
overclocking since they're all unlocked
for overclocking I just wanted a 16 gig
kits which in my opinion is kind of the
bare minimum you should go for if you
actually want to support quad channel
memory on the threader core platform
this is a 3200 speed 16 gig kit that was
chosen from a parametric filter so it is
g.skill memory of course and we have a
fairly reasonable idea that this should
be compatible as far as running at a
higher speed but I want higher speed
memory so that's why I ruled out
anything below 3200 speed so that's all
you're looking for a 16 gig kit and ddr4
3200 you can just sort that by price and
it's just currently choosing the most
inexpensive kit which is also the most
inexpensive kit buy another 20 and 30
bucks so we're getting some great deals
here apparently did roughly the same
thing for the SSD chosen SSD and I
wanted oh the the space on the SSD I
want a good price per gigabyte number
and I actually have found when you sort
by price per gigabyte and you're
including not just 240 250 gig SSDs but
also also 500 gig range SSDs you can get
below 30 cents per gigabytes but you
have to buy a more capacity rich SSD so
you need a 500 gig in order to go for
that in fact the best price per
gigabytes for a not 500 gig range SSD is
all the way down here with the SanDisk
so it's only 84 bucks
and 35 cents per gig so just bear in
mind guys there's some really good deals
on 500 gig SSDs right now for in the 100
to $150 price range so keep an eye on
those as well even though my ultimate
choice for this build was the cheaper
version for a video card again I just
went with a parametric filter and
finding something that would be
relatively inexpensive gtx 1070 is kind
of that balance of like not terribly
overpriced when it going to comparing it
to the MSRP but you still get a lot of
bang for your buck and matches up a
little bit better with something like a
thread ripper I would not want to put
something like a 10 50 or 250 GI or
something in there with a thread ripper
that would make no sense but ok so I
just got the color master master box 5
this is a really solid mid-range case
it's only about 50 to 60 dollars really
good layout internally again comes with
nice fans so things are going to stay
nice and cool for you and of course will
have space for that 250 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler finally a power
supply the EVGA B Q series doing a good
job with the variants I've tried of it
so far very inexpensive comes with nice
cabling so it's going to look relatively
nice all black cables and you can get a
750 watt version here for just about 70
bucks in fact even as well as 60 bucks
if you go for that mail-in rebate so
that is my thread Ripper entry-level
build about entry-level I know about
$2,000 though but again consider that
the 18 core Intel that they have only
paper launched so far is going to be
2,000 bucks by itself that's a pretty
serious like high-end workstation system
you can get going that will easily be
able to handle gaming as well for about
2 grands so I'm really excited that this
platform is launching soon let's get
into the build number 2 though again
this is going off of your guys
recommended recommended recommended
ations from last month we got a mini ITX
risin 5 gaming pc this is meant to be
able to do gaming and streaming it's
also supposed to be small and portable
and this current list that we're
starting out with here is just the
desktop parts but since I did want to
include everything I do have some
supplemental stuff to add on there as
well and actually the price for this has
gone down by 50 bucks since I parted
this up this morning so that's always
nice - coming in about one thousand one
hundred and eleven dollars and 18 cents
with the mail-in rebate of course we got
a risin 5 1600 6 core processor so if
you're gonna be gaming and streaming at
the same
time Rison is a great option for that
you want to go with a six core or better
so this is a really good bang for your
buck price to performance and unlocked
for overclocking as well gigabyte
motherboard a/b 350 and this is one of
just a few little tiny motherboards that
are available right now although this
one is a little bit nicer I think Bastar
has one of these available as well but
this one also has Wi-Fi and imagine if
you're taking this to a dorm or
something like that you might have to
get some advantage by being able to not
have to worry about running an Ethernet
cable everywhere other than that it's
got a nice layout a couple DIMM slots
PCIe 16 by a by 16 at the bottom so I'm
Tim SATA and I believe it also has nm
got two on the back which I should be
able to find no it doesn't nevermind oh
yeah it does what am I talking about
and then it's got an MDOT two slot on
the back there too so you could drop in
a high-speed nvme SSD if you desired
again I went with parametric filters for
most of the other stuff here so for this
one I just wanted a 2 by 8 gig kit so I
want 16 gigs total so you have a little
bit of extra Headroom for doing stuff
beyond just gaming and then again I want
a ddr3 ddr4 3200 because faster memory
is going to make your Rison system
faster overall and again start by price
so we've got a team T force Nighthawk
kit down here at the bottom which you
know may or may not look the prettiest
to you but hey it lights up there so
that's a bonus to lblack though not bad
and it's got the size and the speed that
we want so check out the other options
down in that same price range though if
you want something that might match up a
little bit better that for storage is
pretty much in the same situation as I
was with our thread Ripper build which
is that I'm looking for a really good
price per gigabyte I chose that same 240
gig SSD but again you have some pretty
good options up in the 500 gig range so
check those if you're willing to spend a
little bit more I also added a 2
terabyte hard drive for this since this
is supposed to be an all-inclusive build
that includes accessories and all that
good stuff so you're going to spend 50
to 60 bucks for an additional couple
terabytes of magnetic storage for long
term mass storage and then of course I
went with the gtx 1070 again because
that's kind of what you want to go with
a few or buying slightly higher end and
don't want to pay too much and then for
our case we have a cooler master elites
one
so let's take a quick look at that very
inexpensive case told me about again 30
to 40 bucks usb3 on the front plenty of
ventilation since it is a smaller form
factor you're going to want to make sure
that you have air going in there since
these are some higher-end components its
kettle stick out part part on the back
so it can support larger size power
supplies and this is a little bit bigger
than the 1/10 version of this so I just
wanted there to be a little bit more
space in there for airflow and whatnot
so there's your case although there are
of course other mini ITX case options
that are out there and then for a power
supply with the B Q 600 Watts which
should be more than enough for supplying
power to the core components as well as
the graphics card now I did say this was
supposed to be a complete layout so not
just the core components for the case
like I usually do but also peripherals
as well stuff for streaming so when it
comes to peripherals you're going to
want to first monitor keyboard mouse and
then something to listen to and then
probably a microphone so I went with
monitor keyboard mouse and then a
headset which includes headset for sound
as well as a microphone for talking
since I'm thinking you're probably maybe
going to be streaming with this system
since that was what we're building it
for so for a monitors starting off we
have the 169 $99 Acer g2 for seven hyu
I didn't want this to get into like hey
help me choose the best monitor I just
picked this one out because it's a
really nice combination of specs and
price for less than 200 bucks you get
not just a 1080 display with 2560 by
1440 it's 24 inch which is a pretty
decent size its IPS so it's going to
give you better color depth we've got a
good range of connections including
DisplayPort and HDMI and it's it's
probably like 50 bucks cheaper than most
of the other 2560 by 1440 monitors in
this range do bear in mind that it
doesn't have a base amount on the back
so you're stuck with a fairly mediocre
stand and it doesn't have speakers but
thankfully we also have a headset that's
included but only 170 bucks for that for
40 dollars you can add a Devastator
three gaming combo from Coolermaster
which includes a perfectly adequate
membrane keyboard as well as a mouse
with all the basic Mouse functions you
would need included including a forward
back button this is again just like
really getting the job done quite well
for only about $40 so that's
and combo there we also have of course a
webcam if you're going to be streaming
you probably want to stream your face in
there as well so the basic solution is
your logitech HD c920 old standby it's
only about 60 bucks this gets really
good 1080 image quality and you can set
it up and get going and you you won't
have a problem there oh wait I didn't
even go through everything yet the
headset I was recommended is the hyper
iCloud stinger which is only about 50
bucks really good bang for the buck
again for this one for 50 dollars the
quality you get and everything you can
get the HyperX Club that's another 30
bucks more expensive and it's got better
sound quality as well as a better
microphone but if we're trying to stay
relatively inexpensive check that one
out so if you take the base price of the
system which is around 1100 - eleven
hundred and fifty dollars the
accessories I just listed there is about
three hundred and fifteen dollars so
that would get you right in the say
$1,500 range now if you wanted to take
things up a step and if you're
interested in a question that people ask
me about all the time which is that when
I'm streaming the image quality looks
really good well that's because I have
higher-end equipment so for instance
this camera that you kind of see right
here is the gh4 you don't necessarily
need to spend that much but if you want
the really good image quality and being
able to switch to stuff like this and
also being able to not just stream on
the system that you've built but taking
something like a console and porting it
in there with an external capture device
then add on this extra kit for another
seven hundred and eighty dollars a
capture card and a camera for a camera
the limits gh7 is a sort of slightly
baby brother to the g4 that IgH for and
the GH five that i use but really good
image quality for this one it's $600
camera but it's got clean HDMI out it
comes with the lens in this kit that is
perfectly adequate for what you'd want
to get done with it and then combine
that with something like an Elgato Game
Capture HD 60s which is external just as
a simple HDMI IN does 1080 60 capture of
video externally whether you're
capturing from a camera or capturing
from a console and that would be the
entire solution for gaming streaming
video capture and just about everything
you'd want to do and the system you're
building is very
small and portable so if you wanted to
take it with you to college I think that
would be a good choice as well the total
for all that stuff together including
the g7 and the capture card is about two
thousand two hundred to two thousand two
hundred and fifty dollars so guys that
wraps it up for my monthly builds video
for August 2017 I hope you have enjoyed
and perhaps gained some insight as you
go about choosing parts for your own a
builds at home of course thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video and
don't forget to open the description
where you'll find links to most of the
products that I talked about as well as
a link to be strawpoll where you can
vote on next month's monthly builds
video thanks again for watching and
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
