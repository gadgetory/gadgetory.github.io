Pauls hardware today's video is all
about the brand new corsair graphite
series 760 t computer case and i would
be saying this is my review of this case
but i've never really comfortable
reviewing a product or a case in
particular until i've actually built a
system in it unfortunately I am planning
to completely redo my personal system in
this case very very soon or as soon as I
possibly can at least so stay tuned for
that video coming up in the future where
I'll be giving a lot more sort of
feedback as far as building in the case
and that whole experience for now I'm
going to do a basic unboxing I'll be
going over all the features and give you
guys a nice close up look as well as as
well as giving you a few of my pros and
cons just initial feedback I'm taking it
out of the box and getting a closer look
at it so that said here it is the
corsair graphite series 760 t so after
getting it out of the box first we'll
take a look at the packaging you have
very very nice thick closed cell foam
and i don't usually talk about packaging
that i want to mention it here because
these boxes are often used to reshape
full computer builds and that's very
nice to have extra padding also a black
shroud that protects the finish when you
first take it out now this is the white
version of the coarser graphite 760 t it
also comes with white led's throughout
and there's another version that's
available that has a black finish with
red LEDs now it carries over some of the
look from the corsair graphite 600 t a
little bit but in style it's really much
closer to the more recent 230 t i do
really like that there is more metal to
the finish although there's still a lot
of plastic on the front bezel dimensions
are 568 millimeters high 246 millimeters
wide a 564 millimeters deep that's
twenty two point four by nine point
seven five twenty two point two inches
we also have tons of other board support
for all the standard motherboards you'd
expect plus e ATX and excel ATX so lots
of flexibility there on the front panel
you have a headphone and microphone jack
two speed fan control a couple USB 2.0
and a couple USB 3.0 ports as well as
backlight to that white reset and power
buttons at the top we have our first
potential radiator mount and there's a
ton of radiator support in this case you
can fit a 360 millimeter or two hundred
eighty millimeter rad up here and you
also have a removable magnetic top panel
that you
leave on to reduce some of the noise if
you don't need the airflow you also have
three front five and a quarter inch bays
one of them has a little fold down panel
for your optical drive so you can sort
of maintain the same look which is kind
of nice and then just like the 600 T
there is a pop out front intake dust
filter I absolutely love these and I
will never run a case that does not have
removable dust filters behind the desk
filter you can see two of the three
included 140 millimeter AF 140 L fans
the two on the front have white LEDs
also up here you have support for a 240
millimeter or 280 millimeter radiator on
the left side you have a hinged side
panel with a full window and this is one
of the features that really jumps out at
you I love the easy access of the hinge
side panel I do prefer the kind of lift
up and off method that the 600 T side
panel had to be perfectly honest but
what can you do the doors can be removed
completely by simply lifting them up off
their hinges so that's very nice then on
the back you have some hex ventilation
right up at the top that shows how much
radiator height there is also a 140
millimeter rear exhaust AF 140 L fan
though this one does not have an LED
standard i/o shield knockout and then
nine expansion slots for that XL ATX
support you also have a standard bottom
mounted PSU and then on the bottom of
the case you have really wide sturdy
stands with rubber feet on the bottom
there's a 120 millimeter fan or radiator
mount that opens up if you remove that
drive cage that's above it and then you
have a nice removable dust filter for
the power supply as well which I also
like the right side panel opens up just
like the left although it is opaque
rather than clear and it provides a nice
look at the cable management area you
also get a first look at that black
interior finish and it has black front
panel cabling as well rubber grommets
for the cable routing holes a very
generous CPU backplate cutout and then
back here you also get for 2.5 inch side
mounted tool-free SSD trays which I
really like these cages are really
simple to use
they're also easily removed if you don't
need them and their positions to put the
connectors in a really ideal spot to
show off the drive and sorry if this
vertex to brings back in a nightmare
anybody by the way I'm also quite fond
of the angled top part of the
motherboard tray which gives you a bit
more space for radiators as well as
routing cables behind the radiator apart
from that you have a little more than an
inch of space between the tray and the
side panel and you have some
thoughtfully placed cable tie downs as
well as many many options for passing
cables back from the main chamber moving
on to the interior beneath the smoky
glass window we have a removable
reconfigurable drive cage configuration
so you get to drive cages out of the box
and support for up to six 3.5 inch or
2.5 inch drives you can also maybe find
a way somehow to buy two more of these
drive cages and then you can actually
install up to 12 drives here total plus
the four 2.5 inch side mounted SSD trays
of course so tons of drive support you
get a really nice black painted interior
pre-installed motherboard standoffs plus
the nice permanent anchor point at the
center that will kind of hold the
motherboard in place while you secure
down the rest of the screws here's
another look at that rear 140 millimeter
exhaust fan and then below it the
expansion slots do come with black thumb
screws you've also got three tool free
five and a quarter inch drive bays up at
the top and then for graphics card
support you can do up to three hundred
and forty millimeter cards with the
drive cage installed and four hundred
and sixteen millimeter cards without
that two-speed front panel controller is
powered with a SATA plug and you get for
three or four pin headers that use three
pin voltage control also your standard
front panel connectors with a kind of
unfortunate burst of color but you get
block plugs for USB 2.0 USB 3.0 and HD
audio if I have a complaint initially
hear about the 760 T would be the power
supply mount some padding here would
have been nice for some noise and
vibration reduction also the hard drive
trays are a design that I've seen many
many times before and I generally
despise they need to be flexed and kind
of wrapped around 3.5 inch drives and
the four plugs just never really seem to
like to stay in place but overall though
damn seven six eighty is beautiful and
it is packed with features so first
glance the course I graphite 760 T
strikes me as a fantastic case I really
like the design I like the window I like
the fact you've got this side panel
latch you can just open and everything I
really like how I managed to get all
this plastic back on there like
perfectly isn't that amazing
continuity anyway thanks for watching
this video guys and
if you're interested in when you can buy
this case and I know a lot of you are
because when I first tweeted a picture
when I picked it up a bunch of tweets
back to me saying where can i buy that
when can I buy that and the answer is
now you should be able to buy it right
now I'll post a link in the description
to this case for sale over on Newegg and
while you're down there go ahead and
click the like button maybe leave me a
comment in the comment section about
what you think of this case and when you
speculate the hardware it might be that
IV I might be installing in it and
whether or not I might be planning a
water cooling loop at some point did I
just say that I hope I didn't say that
anyway thank you so much for watching
this video guys see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
