head's being cut off but that's okay
it's too late for that now I'm going to
be monitoring here for just a second to
make sure that I'm live and assuming
everything is going okay which I think
it should be welcome everyone to today's
video which is a live build I'm going to
be assembling a computer today all the
parts you see here cost about $700 total
and it's an AMD risin system this is
suitable for gaming as well as
multitasking and for anyone who's
interested in building a desktop PC
especially if you're going to get into
gaming and you've never done it before
I'm going to do this live so who knows
what might happen but I'm going to be
giving my best attempt at walking you
guys through the steps one at a time
right here as I do it and we'll see how
things go all that said it does look
like I'm live so that's good again sorry
my heads chopped off but that's okay my
focus was on the computer parts not on
me but let's just get things started
here by going over the parts one at a
time
also a quick word of warning since I am
doing this live there might be dogs
barking from time to time and I might
have some extra noise happening outside
since I am just reporting from my garage
but all that said parts because you have
to choose out the main parts for a
computer before you put everything
together
I usually classify all the parts that
are needed for a modern-day computer
into seven categories the first category
is the processor for that we have a
risin 5 1400 processor this is a quad
core it's one of AMD's newest series of
CPUs quad core with hyper-threading
which means you get eight threads for
your operating system or programs to
work with for physical cores and it's
been a very nice performer it only cost
you around 160 to 170 dollars and it
comes with a cooler in the box and we're
going to be using that cooler today
second piece that you're going to need
is a motherboard this is kind of the
central piece that holds everything
together with any computer the
motherboard we're using is the Asus
prime v 350 M - a it's a micro ATX
motherboard which means it's a little
bit smaller it's a little bit shorter
that way then a full sized ATX board and
to go with it I have a micro ATX case as
well be 350 is a little bit more
inexpensive when it comes to the
chipsets available for rising processors
B 350 will get you the
most the the most of the main
functionality that you need for instance
if you go up to X 370 the main thing
you're going to get the support for like
to weight graphics cards configurations
SLI and crossfire that kind of thing
which honestly isn't that big of a deal
for most people especially if you're
building on a budget third thing is
going to be what should i what should I
say next
I said case so let's talk about the case
third thing is a case you need a case
whole different everything together
other than that they why they have a
wide range of prices this is only about
$40.00 it is a very inexpensive case by
couger the mg 100 micro ATX so
everything's going to be a little bit
smaller a little bit tinier footprint
and then beyond that cases like I said
can get really expensive they can get
100 bucks 200 bucks and you do get some
nice features for that for our purposes
we're going to be showing what it's like
to work in a budget case but it's not
really the case doesn't really affect
performance so there's not too much of a
concern there for memory at the Corsair
Vengeance lpx this has been a very
popular kit to use with Rison because
it's very compatible you got to make
sure that the memory get is compatible
it's risin and risin it's kind of
finicky with certain memory especially
if you wanna run at higher speeds this
kit has proven to be very reliable even
when running at higher speeds it's a
3,000 speed kit but you can run into
29:33 with just about all the rise and
CP rising processors that I have tried
alright that's that's what four things
we have three things left the power
supply is the EVGA 500 BQ power supply
is another thing where you can get away
with the cutting some corners and
getting a power supply it's a little bit
less expensive this is actually a newer
one and they have a 500 ba 80 plus
bronze weight rated 500 watt power
supply it's been very popular for budget
builders for quite a while because you
can get it for about 35 to 40 dollars
this one is a new version 2 BQ which is
all of the basic same internals as the
500 B except the cables look a little
bit nicer however this one does cost
about 10 or 15 bucks more so if you're
on a strict budget just go with that 500
B honestly it's exactly the same thing I
just wanted to try this one out because
I hadn't before and I was ordering all
the parts literally today I picked up
like half of these parts from new egg
this morning and so that's what I'm with
there for a graphics card you do
need a graphics card at least with this
build because the CPU were using doesn't
have integrated graphics the graphical
reason is the rx 580 if you reference
any of the links I've have done any
description for this video you might
notice I have some of the parts that are
slightly different I basically told you
to find an rx 588 gig version that's as
cheap as possible and you can find that
for about $220 this one from Asus is a
very nice version of the rx 580 but it
does cost more towards 270 to $280 I'm
using because the one it's the one I
have here also I was really curious what
kind of this this case is supposed to be
able to handle GPUs up to 13 inches this
is about a 12-inch graphics card it
should fit if it doesn't I have backup
options that are available and then the
final thing that we need is going to be
storage for storage I have an SSD
because whenever I'm building a system
now I always go with an SSD this is a
sand disk in the description I have the
SanDisk Ultra Plus 240 gig
this is an ultra 2 honestly it's not
that huge of a difference but for our
purposes it's going to get the job done
I recommend it 240 or 256 gig SSD to
start with and then since this isn't
going to be able to hold everything that
we need I always recommend finding an
old hard drive an old one or 2 terabyte
hard drive that you have to add to this
if you want some additional storage if
you don't have that maybe consider
dropping another 40 or 50 dollars on a 2
terabyte hard drive just to make sure
that you don't run out of space on this
SSD but you want the SSD because that's
what makes everything fast all right so
now that those parts are all listed I do
have a couple optional parts for this
build and that is specifically because
of the motherboard I chose the case I
chose and the fact that you really want
to pay some attention to airflow I've
added an extra fan to this build and I
added a couple links in the description
to so you guys can find those this is a
fractal 120mm 120 millimeter venturi fan
I did this because this case only comes
with a single fan I wanted to add
another one for an intake in the front
and then I also have a fan splitter
right here because the motherboard
actually has one header on it to plug in
a case fan so I want to use a splitter
so we can plug this fan and the one that
comes with the case both into the
motherboard beyond that I do have some
equipments of course that I'll be using
I have a rubber mat I'm going to be
using that to build on just to keep
things safe and then I also have
screwdriver standard screwdriver small
screwdriver this is from a Fixit kit who
knows if I'll end up digging into the
iFixit kits for more stuff during this
video but this is my this is one I got
during during scrapyard worse as so it's
got many mi and then lastly I have a
knife to open things and speaking of
which let's start opening things that's
like the fun part right it's actually
opening things by the way if you're
watching live thanks to any of you guys
who have happens to join you guys are
great people I hope you wait what yeah I
should use smoke smoke to check the
airflow I'm not going to be focusing on
chat too much because my goal is really
to show you guys how to build a system
and if I answer questions in chat that's
going to be distracting but the first
thing I want to do of course is get all
of your parts unbox now I'm not
expecting to crazy good packaging for
this cougar case because again it's a
$40 case and 40 bucks you know like you
don't you're not going to have probably
a ton of really advancing stuff going on
with this but here's the best way to get
a case out of the box
open the top flaps flip it upside down
watch for handles on the side if they
exist this one doesn't have them and
slide it up like so prepare yourself for
a brief electric shock static electric
shock wasn't too bad this time around
and then we can remove the rest of the
styrofoam gift case out okay sorry about
that headphone users getting the case
out of the box is probably going to be
the main points where I have problems
with potentially hitting the the mic
because the mic is right here but
hopefully I doesn't mean that you guys
can hear me okay alright welcome welcome
once again anyone who is joining live
and chats wow so the nice thing about an
inexpensive case is it's also very
lightweight this is steel but it's very
thin gauge steel so a case typically is
going to have your i/o points on the
back that's where the motherboard sticks
out this is where your power supply
amount that's where you plug in actually
AC power these are some expansion slots
down here for graphics cards you have
two side panels
this is a main side panel and hey good
job cougar these are plastic thumb
screws but they are thumb screws and I
like thumb screws so we'll set those
aside removing those some screws allows
you to get the side panel off usually
when you're building with the system
that is pretty thin this is what you get
when you pay $40 for a case not super
thick stuff but you know what they've
rolled some of the edges over here so
it's not too terrible this does have
some optional fan mounts here on the
side so you could pop fans on there to
get extra air being pushed in directly
onto your components that might run a
little warmer like the CPU and GPU for
our purposes we probably do not need
that though today this case again does
come with a rear exhaust fan which is
120 millimeter that's nice and I'm gonna
I'm just going to start off by removing
both of those side panels and setting
them off to the side we'll come back to
those later all right
this it really is nice actually having
such a lightweight case cases can be so
cumbersome sometimes in this one I could
just lift it up and toss it around I
dress also some different camera angles
to show you so look I can give you guys
the top down if you want I'll try to
remember to switch between those from
time to time a bag of case accessories
some plastic oh it's got little feet are
those feet that's have feet oh yeah hey
that's another little thing you get when
you get a budget case it does have a
little rubber pads for the feet but they
come they don't come free pre-attached
have to peel them off and stick them on
the bottom I kind of want to do that
actually
bear with me once for one moment while I
attach these adhesive foam foam feet
pads holy crap I have 1,700 people
thanks to all you guys for showing up
here again if you're in live chat I'm
going to be glancing that at that from
time to time but I'm probably not going
to be answering too many questions of
that kind of thing because I'm trying to
teach people how to build a computer on
the fly something I've actually wanted
to do for a while I intended to do this
video several weeks ago and then that
was when my one of my GH fours video
outs broke so I had to kind of postpone
it
alright so there's that case we're going
to set this aside for now let's go back
to this little view and we're going to
prepare our motherboard by installing
the CPU and memory and cooler on to it
let's also set graphics card aside so
here is our motherboard basis and we'll
just pop this out you got the
motherboard the main things we're going
to need from here are going to be the
motherboard you will need a SATA cable
so this should come with your
motherboard and we will use this to
connect up the SSD and then your
motherboard is probably also going to
have a manual which you might want to
pull out and set aside because you
there's a chance you might need a
reference a couple things in there and
then finally you're going to want your
i/o shields which is a little piece of
metal again budget case budget
motherboards this is very very no-frills
IO shield there but again will get the
job done and that's our goal for today
is to build a computer that has a lot of
performance for not like crazy months
money builds evident Lee had been around
$1000 plus price and it's nice to do
stuff that's a little bit more budget
because I know not everyone has that
much money to spend alright so I'm also
going to do it we're going to try to
keep things organized as I proceed along
here let's see if you guys the old
top-down view punch in a little bit mmm
all right look I can focus too maybe
okay cool so first get your motherboard
out of the box out of the protective
anti-static bag that it comes in and
check it out you know on the motherboard
you're going to have your socket that's
right there that's where the CPU goes
there's a arm on the side lift the arm
to install the CPU drop Darren back down
to lock it in place there's also this
bracket right here these two pieces and
these are actually retention mounts for
the heat sink fan that goes on top of
here however the heatsink thing that
we're using
is not going to use these so I'm going
to be removing these two little pieces
now so these long slots here that's for
system memory so we're going to be
occupying two of the four usually it's
every other slot that you populate but
again you can reference a motherboard
manual for that so I'm going to be
occupying slot number I believe in slot
number two and slot number four here
there's some other plugs for plugging in
power from the power supply the long 24
pin here and the eight pin right over
here and then these down here expansion
slots so the big long one is where the
graphics card is going to go and then
down here along the bottom edge you have
places to connect other things such as
the connectors for the case like the
front panel USB is going to plug into
these little ports down here you might
also have a front panel audio header
down there and then these slots here are
these plugs and these two plugs here all
SATA plugs
that's where you plug in storage like an
SSD or hard drive or even an optical
drive if you're going old school and you
have one of those finally there's an
MDOT two slot right here this is this
narrow narrow little slot right there
with these mounting points that's also
for newer SSDs we're not going to be
using one of those today but that's part
of the reason I chose this motherboard
is because you can install it with your
SATA SSD like we'll be using and then if
you wanted to upgrade in the future
there's tons of ways to upgrade the
system one of them is to add an MDOT to
nvme SSD which you can drop in right
there not too much to speak of on the
back of the motherboard but do bear in
mind that there is this back plate right
here and we're going to need to keep
that although it is going to come loose
once we remove those four screws which
I'll be doing in just a moment so we can
properly mount our heatsink so speaking
of the heatsink and the CPU let's get
that of the box I put everything back in
the boxes a lot of this stuff has been
used once or twice before but I wanted
to give you guys the full experience so
here we go
fortunately I have not yet used this CPU
cooler so you guys can get that
experience too when you install CPU
cooler to cool the CPU that's what CPU
coolers are for you will need to put
some thermal paste on there the thermal
paste provides a thermal interface
between the CPU which is going to get
hot as it does work and the heatsink
which absorbs the
eat then as a fan on it that pushes air
over those fins and disperses the heat
so what we're going to need to do is
make sure that our CPU is ready to go
with thermal paste if I didn't have
thermal paste pre apply it on here like
this circle of gooey stuff is actually
thermal paste on there then I would need
to actually add some but when you're
doing a first time installation you can
use this pre applied stuff just bear in
mind if you ever need to uninstall this
and reinstall it or anything like that
you're going to need to get the proper
stuff to clean that off and then reapply
some thermal paste it's not all that
tough but it is probably a next stage of
PC building if you've never done PC
building before all right here is our
CPU installation let's get started with
that CPU is in this little clamshell
case we're going to grab it by the sides
they put a couple little notches in
there to make that a little bit easier
on the bottom you'll see a bunch of
little pins those are delicate you want
to try your very best not to touch those
or bend them or anything like that and
then you'll want to pay close attention
because there's a gold triangle on the
bottom here you can see it pretty
distinctly on one corner and that
triangle is going to line up with a
triangle that's on the edge of the CPU
sockets it's the triangle the CPU socket
is a lot harder to see but it's right
there trust me only one corner has a
little triangle matched into it so I got
to do is lift up little arm line up
those triangles is they're both in the
same corner set the CPU gently on the
socket and if you've lined everything up
it should just drop right in there that
is called a zero insertion force socket
because you don't need to put any
pressure on it lower that little arm
back down and that is how you install an
AMD CPU it's actually very very simple
if you're going to have any difficulty
with CPU installation when it comes to
AMD you're probably gonna have it when
you uninstall it but if you do this
thing if you do this right you probably
won't have to do that
unless you may be a bigger your cooler
in the future now as mention this cooler
uses the existing backplate that's on
there but it doesn't use these plastic
brackets on the top so that means that
we're going to need to pull those off
that's really simple there's just four
little Phillips head screws so I'm going
to unscrew those also thinking I should
grab my electric screwdriver at some
point because that does tend to make
these videos go a little bit faster
and we'll remove all four of those okay
now we have our heat sink fan and we
want to pay attention again to where
that thermal paste is going to be and
not touching that we have four mounting
points one two three four on the four
corners those are going to mount up with
the four mounting points on here and
then you can position this however you
want there's actually a some mods on
line so we're removing this plastic
circle on the outside and rotating it 45
degrees so the Andy low goes on the top
but honestly you can do it either way
you can have it that way
you can have it that way it doesn't
matter let's do it this way and we're
just going to line up those four screws
and start them all reading and the idea
is that you don't want to put a bunch of
you don't want to do one corner at once
basically I am just getting each of
these screws started to be screwed in
I'm barely threading each one just to
get it started so all four points are
kind of secure but these are not screwed
in yet and then I'm going to go opposite
corners and give it two or three turns
on each side just to make sure that as
it is being as pressure is being applied
between the heat sink fan and the CPU
that it's done evenly because you don't
want to put a bunch of pressure on one
corner as opposed to the other that's
pretty much it
CPUs installed heat sink fan is
installed now we have this plug for the
fan that's that's necessary it needs to
plug in so the fan will spin and have
power those are usually pretty
distinctly labeled this one's a CPU fan
right here so I'm just going to plug
that in right now and then we'll keep in
mind that we have this little wire
hanging off here actually an easy way to
do this is to just kind of tuck it up
under here again there's a million
different ways to do cable management
but I find taking care of it right off
the bat is a good way to do it so yeah
all I really did was kind of wedge that
in there so it's going to stay in place
it's not going to look bad it's not
going to come loose I could also wait it
until I got this in the case to kind of
tuck that away and everything but for
now it's getting the job done all right
let's make things a little bit brighter
maybe if I can
do this on the fly
okay cool next up we're going to do the
memory Mehmedi okay so memory again is
fairly simple it's just a couple sticks
it's slots into these long slots right
here they are notched in the middle so
you can only install them one way the
notch is not directly in the middle of
the memory it's slightly offset so
basically you got a look at these slots
here look at that notch it's based there
in the center of that and make sure that
your memory notch is in the right place
so that would be wrong and to flip this
around there's a couple caches on
sometimes they just on one side
sometimes they're on both side of this
and we just want to open those up and
draw our memory down into the slots and
I'm going to put firm pressure on both
sides of it and it kind of snaps into
place you'll hear a very satisfying
clicky sound as the latches kind of grab
hold of that and we have one more here
goes in just the same way and snap there
we go alright so memory is installed CPU
and CPU heatsink fan is installed we're
moving along quite well here and in fact
I think all I'm going to do for the next
minute or two is try to keep things tidy
if I can but I just get a few more
things out of the box so let's switch
back yeah that's better
all right so case is out actually know
it before I even do any of that
let's get that fan installed on the
front of this alright so when it comes
to case fans there's an open side of the
fan and then there's a closed side that
has the supports in the brackets right
there usually this is the intake and the
part with the bracket is where the air
gets pushed out so since I want this to
be on the front of the case we have an
exhaust back here let's push an air out
that way I want this to be on the front
of the case right up here pulling air in
so I just need to make sure that the
exhaust part of that is facing back and
this heat sink fan actually has arrows
on it that will also show you the
rotational direction of the fan blades
as well as the direction of the airflow
and then we're just going to mount this
up in front it is a hundred and twenty
millimeter fan so there's a hundred
twenty millimeter mount right up here
and that's pretty straightforward it
just sits right in there
I don't have a good way of showing you
guys this but I'm going to need to set
it in here and then I'm going to need to
screw it in from the front okay most
cases that have front panels like this
will you can remove them you just got to
grab from the front right down here then
actually this has a handle which makes
me feel like this is going to work and
you pull and it feels like you're going
to break and break something but it pops
off just like that
this is just a plastic facade that goes
across the front but getting that up
allows us to access those four mounting
points for that for the fan and assuming
I have fan screws which I do they came
with the fan that I got I'll just screw
that in and get that mounted I am going
to grab my electric screwdriver they'll
be out back okay
things are going well so when I first
planned out this builds because I
actually planned this build out last
month and I wanted to build it I've been
wanting to build it and it just kind of
turned out that today I ended up being a
good day to do that but when I planned
it out I actually chose a different case
again it was a budget cases about a $40
case but it was a Thermaltake case I
just completely lost where I set those
screws over I originally chose a
Thermaltake case for this but I didn't
have that case and I needed to get stuff
this morning so my cases were limited to
something that would fit within the
budget about 40 bucks was micro ATX
because I don't like doing a full sized
ATX case if it's a micro ATX build and
then finally it had to be available at
Newegg for will call pickup so I did
consider some Roseville options
I consider the fractal core 1100 I've
actually built in the fractal core 1100
so if you're from if you're interested
in a build in that case just check my
channel and you should be able to find
that but since I had built in it before
I decided you know let's try something
new let's get this cougar one going here
used a few cougar product products in
the past again inexpensive case so
there's lots of things that are just you
don't see with more expensive cases like
there's a bunch of hot glued stuff and
the panel right here and there's like a
string of it that went across the USB
port which is really just an aesthetic
thing but I'm going to pull that out
there
okay beyond that this should be all I
need as far as getting this front panel
so I'm going to pop it back on but this
would also be what you would need to do
if you did want to install a five and a
quarter inch drive up here like an
optical drive or a fan controller or
something like that you can also access
these front panels here if you need to
get at like the the five and a quarter
inch front panels and a 3.5 inch front
panel so add-on stuff can be access to a
thing you could also pull this up if you
wanted to I don't know if modding or
anything like that
that's fairly simple to get on and off
thankfully in this case does have a USB
3.0 and a USB 2.0 on the front
headphone and mic jack and then a power
reset buttons so all the basic functions
you need that's not super pretty good
but when you're when you're on a budget
that this is this is the lesson of when
I'm on a budget this is where I skimp I
skip on stuff like the case that doesn't
matter as much
maybe the CPU cooler this isn't this is
the Wraith stealth it's not the best CPU
cooler again it's going to get the job
done I would probably want to upgrade
that in the future if I wanted to so
yeah but like I said I wanted to make
sure there's plenty of ways to upgrade
the system in the future all right I
want to get everything else out of the
boxes just so I can clear some stuff out
here so let's get the graphics card
going I also wanted to do this build
today because it's still may may may
18th as of doing this build and
streaming this video and I'm leaving for
Computex next week so I'll be in Taipei
for Taipei Taiwan for 9 or 10 days and
then I'll be back and then it'll be
summer and I'm probably not going to be
able to do live builds from my garage
during the summer simply because it's
too hot so there we go alright so
getting getting stuff all over the place
right there is our GPU motherboard let's
get the power supply out actually
probably a good probably good to get the
power supply in first here since it's a
top mountain power supply so we'll do
that where did my life go okay my knife
is directly in front of me yeah once it
hits you know early-june here it gets
really hot so I do have an air
conditioner out here in the garage but
it's loud so I can't really do that at
the same time all right I think it's
kind of cool I've been using a lot of
EVGA power supplies recently and EVGA
just keeps coming out with
well-placed power supplies I feel like
this is again the newest iteration of
the 500 V it's the 500 BQ there's a
queue on the end there and whether they
give me two sets of screws oh they
didn't it's just taped inside the box
right the BQ version means it looks good
it actually has all black cables so even
though this is only partially modular
the modular power supply means that the
cables come separately entirely so you
can unplug them and get rid of them if
you're not actually using them partially
modular but also all black cables this
one right now is about $55 although I
feel like given EVGA track record you're
probably gonna be able to find it for
less than that at some point and yeah
it's so not you know not that high ends
not that powerful only 500 watts but 500
watts is all most people need for a
standard gaming PC and whenever we
recommended the 500 B we always say get
the 500 B you're going to get you know
the most for your money just remember
those cables look hideous these do not
they're all black so there you go anyone
who's looking for a budget power supply
maybe consider this one if you're
willing to spend an extra 10 bucks or so
for making the cables pretty alright so
our power supply again is going to go up
on the top right up here and it mounts
at the back with four screws and you'll
notice your power supply has a fan on
one side of it in this case in
particular you definitely make sure the
fan faces down it's going to pull air up
out of the case and then push it out the
back in some cases where the power
supply mounts at the bottom you'd still
want have the fan facing down because
it's probably a fan filter down there or
you can't have it facing up too but
honestly that's a debate I don't want to
get too much into right now so let's
just get this power supply up in there
again just four screws and they probably
come with your power supply sometimes
your case will also come with the screws
that will work for this and they taped
the screws into the case
screws bagging is taped check okay cool
how's things going in chat oh my god
there's over 2,000 people watching this
is crazy you guys crazy it's only
Thursday I would expect more viewers in
a mid day on like a Saturday or
something like that but yeah okay two
more of these cool okay and that should
be held pretty securely up in the top
which you guys can't see yes there we go
power supplies up on the top this will
allow us to at least see where the power
supply is and get kind of a vague idea
of where the cables are going to start
to go there really is no cable
management in this case in a lot of
higher-end cases if you're going to
spend 60 70 80 bucks per case you'll
have room back here to tuck away your
cables we don't have that in this case
but it doesn't mean the case is smaller
so since we also have an optical drive
I'm going to probably be pushing most of
the extra cables up in here to kind of
hide them if I can then everything else
just routing down to the bottom to where
it might need to get connected now we
can at last drop the drop that
motherboard in here you
and once you have the heat sink fan
installed on a motherboard like this you
can with some reasonable amount of
assurance hold the motherboard by that
although you don't go don't want to go
swinging it around or anything at that
and of course before you install your
motherboard you always want to install
your i/o shield first Iowa shield should
line up with the i/o on the back of the
motherboard and that means that the
three small holes for the three small
holes for the audio outs are at the
bottom this is one of those kind of
annoying IO shields because it's it's
low budgets and it's not sitting in this
groove the way I want it to and it's
also all metal which means I'm going to
cut myself if I push on it too much so
I'm going to use the butt end of my
screwdriver and I'm going to from the
inside push on that to hopefully pop it
into place and I have recommended this
little technique multiple times before
and who knows it might actually even
work maybe come on there you go there we
go aha and once that's in it should stay
should hopefully maybe
okay trying to remember to refocus as I
move around alright this is the I on the
motherboard we're going to kind of angle
that into the case dropped oh you know
what I can't do that yet what am I
telling you guys it's supposed to be a
tutorial alright
another thing about cases is they have
to have standoffs which are small little
screws that sort of provide a little bit
of gap between this metal plate that
we're attaching the motherboard to and
the motherboard itself again a lot of
cases will come with those pre-installed
this case is not one of them though
again budget case they make you do a
little bit more of the manual labor so
the standoffs I'll try to give you guys
a slightly better view of this standoffs
look kind of like this focus
the standoff look like that they're very
tiny they're usually made of brass and
they're going to have probably there's
going to be between five and nine of
them depending on the size of your case
and everything I always recommends
double-checking which screw type these
actually work with first which appears
to be the Wow
that's interesting which appears to be
neither neither these none of these
types of screws will work with these
standoffs it's does it make sense this
probably means it's the thin thread
because I tried that at first sight so
it wants the thin thread there's a thin
thread and a rough thread it wants thin
stuff so we get the glorious job now of
taking the same number of these as our
motherboard has standoff points which is
one two three four five six and from
there know if you guys were able to see
that one two three four five and six and
we'll need to install standoffs into the
appropriate locations that match up with
that on the motherboard so this might
take just a moment or two another nice
thing that he sometimes gets is a
standoff nut but again the case did not
come with that do i I might have one of
those over here right
would be nice but I do not have that
alright there's two four more one two
three four cool
first for the go in are the same
standoffs that every motherboard uses
the top left the one just below the i/o
shield this one and this one and those
are the same mounting points that a mini
ITX motherboard would use there you go
and usually every single motherboard has
at least those four then we want the two
just to the south there is that one
here's this one if this was something
that I actually realized I might have
done this before I started filming
because this is the part screwing in the
screws that is not quite as entertaining
but there you go alright it's also
interesting they tied it tied the cable
for the fan the exhaust fan in a nut
I'm just going to loosen it up so Stan
we're going to plug into the header on
the motherboard but we'll worry about
that later
for now let's just get that motherboard
installed okay so I usually put the i/o
in first just try to push that up
against that IO shield and line it up so
everything kind of picks out
I'm not sure how well you guys can see
but probably better if I switch cameras
so there's the IO right there and it
just pokes through and then I get I get
I give it a nice push up against that IO
to hold it in place and that will
theoretically align at least one of
those standoff points that I just set up
and then we take our screwdriver
theoretically again okay there's one
once you get one in it'll hold it in
place I usually do that one a little bit
loose so the other stuff doesn't is you
know I can mine can jiggle it a little
bit and line it up in case they are
off-center but again five more screws
and let's see how fast I can do this
okay
trying to use my iFixit screwdriver
because yeah there we go I fix it
screwdriver has a little put you put
your palm on the end of it then you can
twist it let's get a nice okay
here is three no that's for now that's
three
I can't count that's four and
five one more okay
if you guys wonder why I don't do these
types of videos more often as far as the
live builds it's because they can be
tedious from time to time or at least a
little bit slower moving if you haven't
already noticed and yeah whenever I make
a build and edit it I almost always you
know don't dwell too long on the
screwing in the motherboard part all
right I am now going to plug in metal
fan splitter here into the single fan
header which is kind of back towards the
back here and this is going to allow me
to get the fans plugged in and actually
I might have a little bit of an issue
because that fan points the the plug is
right here which is kind of an awkward
point spot it's fairly close for me to
plug in this rear fan but the front fan
I need to write that cable over for it
and the cable is only so long I mean not
not terribly short or anything so I'm
actually thinking I might just run this
along the bottom bottom edge like
underneath and tuck it back up behind
the graphics curtain so I'm going to
plug that in now and then the idea will
be that I can sort of push that out to
the side and get a cable managed
properly once I actually get the
graphics card in there okay I'm also
going to try my best to kind of wrap up
this other fan plug for the exhaust and
get that sucked up out of the way cable
management is one of those things that's
just you got to do it a bunch of times
to sort of figure out little tricks here
and there to get better or worse at it
or that kind of thing and you know just
don't give yourself a hard time over it
or about it like the first time you're
getting it done because nobody's system
is going to have perfect cable
management the first time around that's
just it's just not going to happen
I'm also going to use that as an excuse
to not do the grayscale management here
cuz I don't want to you know I set the
bar too high or anything
check that tuck that in there and hold
on I need a clip ok I'm using some wire
Clippers that's my other tool I did use
a twist tie down there a metal twist tie
which you can use in your system for
kill management but I recommend using
them sparingly because they do have
metal in them only use them if they're
properly covered up and everything like
you know you've got there there don't
use them if they have exposed metal I
guess is what I'm trying to say ok ah
motherboards install whoo happy about
that
power supplies installed let's get some
some stuff plugged into the motherboard
because if you hadn't noticed from our
case we have a grip of cables coming off
right there there are these little guys
which are front panel connectors for
power reset LED activity lights there's
a USB there is a audio and there is a
USB 3 we need to plug all these in if we
want all this stuff on the front panel
to actually work properly
so again just going to kind of bring
these up in here plug them in one at a
time and then figure out where in the
case I can sort of move stuff around to
tuck the cables back away however I can
and real let's try to focus
that's better maybe if one day I'll get
a camera person who can adjust the
camera for me so I don't have to stop
talking to do it alright it's also
getting warmer by the minute here with
all the lights on don't worry though
I can I can muddle through alright power
cables we have 2 extra modular cables
we're going to plug in one of these is
going to be what is known as pci express
graphics cable power cables they're
usually six pin plug blocks or six plus
two pin plug blocks one side goes into
the power supply itself usually where it
says vga if you're plugging in VGA
cables and then we have one more modular
power supply cable to add this one is
the SATA plug so this is really solely
going to be to plug in power to our
serial ata drive although this does have
multiple plugs that come off the end of
it here which means that if I added more
drives I could still use a single cable
to plug in up to three of those and
again modular plug this time the one
that's labeled SATA alright hang those
out there now a good question here is
going to be how the heck am I going to
mount minus SD because I don't know if
there's even a 2.5 inch drive mounts in
this in this case I might have to figure
something out for that I have to mount
it I might have to be get creative down
here towards the bottom or something
like that the nice thing about us is
these this is a 2.5 inch drive which
means it needs a 2.5 inch drive mount
and what I'm looking at in here is
mainly these five and a quarter inch
mounts up here or 3.5 inch mounts down
here I need something smaller SSDs have
no moving parts though or anything like
that so they're pretty durable which
means I like I've mounted an SSD into a
case just like velcro and it stays where
it's where it's where it should and all
that kind of stuff not a big deal but I
think what I'm actually going to do just
to get some improv up
improvisation going is just mount it to
this bottom piece here because there are
potentially some screw holes right there
that would work just fine in fact I
think I'm going to do that right now
where did my yeah ah you can't already
tell I'm very good at losing screws and
screwdrivers and stuff I was in building
all part of the game all right
by the way it is entirely possible that
this case does have a 2.5 inch mount
that I'm just completely unaware of Bob
we'll save that for later okay
sorry
okay I'm back sorry I was I had to make
sure wasn't a pizza or something like
that it was just a delivery but they
dropped it off okay let's move on to
plugging in the cables since I have
everything lined up SSDs in there mostly
shouldn't move
all right front panel connectors are the
worst connectors they suck everyone
hates them and they're terrible but you
should have four typically in here
power switch reset switch power LED hard
drive LED LEDs will say plus and minus
on them and those do matter what is plus
and what is minus the hard drive ones
the the side of the power and reset
switch not so much sometimes you can see
labeled on the motherboard itself where
to plug them in and if you can't make
that out or if you just want to double
check here's where you will definitely
want to double check the mother
motherboard manual find F panel front
panel system panel connector or
something like that and that will point
to you where each of those little plugs
are and we hates them oh he hates them
all right
we have power switch power switch
oh that's LED what's going on why don't
they do that it's confusing okay let's
do power LED plus it's on that side okay
oh come on
this is another one of those things that
I don't typically show the full process
of when I'm doing standard video all
right I have two of the four connected
and now adding lights or that reset
switch and the hard drive LED positive
should go on the same side all right I
don't play with right it's teasing me
okay that's just how they're connected
thank God that's the most hateful part
of any computer builds let's move on all
right front panel audio and USB plugs
are pretty much the same little 10 pin
blocks they have one pin blanked out
it's in a different spot don't try to
get these confused and plug one in where
the other is supposed to go usually it's
pretty easy to tell the difference again
because that difference safety key pin
but that's not to say no one has ever
tried to plug these in the wrong way
before now we get USB
go and lastly that's big old USB 3.0
right there and I'm realizing that I
could have done better top-down lighting
today but too late for that now
okay we will crank the ISO cool alright
so those are plugged in at the bottom
and I'm not sure how I guess and you
guys can see that but that's that's
pretty bad down that is just all these
cables coming off but we'll worry about
that later basically I'm going to try to
take all this excess I'm going to try to
push it all towards the front as much as
possible and then bundle it all up up
there somewhere but we'll worry about
that later and main time let's get those
power plugs connected again we've got
two of those which I pointed out earlier
in the video one is the big one that's
one two four pin and the eight pin which
is up at the top I'm really glad I made
that brighter that's way better
okay 24 pin will do first there's a
catch on one side of the plug I'm sorry
you guys can't see the plug very well
because it's being blocked by the drive
cage but uh goes like this ooh here's a
situation where the edge of the
motherboard because it's kind of
sticking out here doesn't have a very
good support so definitely want to kind
of wrapping my fingers underneath the
bottom of the motherboard as I plug the
power plug in just to make sure I don't
flex it too much motherboards are fairly
durable I don't say they're like super
durable but um you definitely want to
avoid cracking or breaking the PCB
because that is something that can't
happen if you put too much force on them
all right kind of wrap that around a
little bit so some of the excess can be
tucked away now we have that eight pin
which is right up here at the top
there you go over here by the Bing yeah
that's in it so only two more plugs
coming off the power supply and stuff
that need to be plugged in again this
double one for the graphics card and
this triple one that Sita which is for
the SSD actually I forgot this is these
already there so look that's a to wanted
okay SATA plugs are kind of l-shaped
both on the data cable itself as well as
the power cable so you can only plug
them in one way but again they are
fairly delicate so don't try to force it
one way or another this is the data
cable so this is just a connection
between the SSD and the motherboard so
one end goes this is the other end down
here into the motherboard like so cool
and then we just get the graphics card
so all right graphics card again goes in
this long slot and there are two
expansion slots here at the back now
this is a type of case that the
expansion slots are just little little
metal pieces that you pop off so um you
got to figure out how to do that I guess
which I want to flat-head screwdriver
for it and fine okay I am just using a
screwdriver to kind of get these started
and you just kind of bend them and they
they pop up they're not replaceable so
try to make sure that you're removing
the right ones for this particular case
I'm removing the two middle just forward
down here and I mean I'm removing the
two of them that are in the middle again
and then graphics cards just going to
drop in right thing so here we go GPU
make sure that you remove anything from
the graphics card before you install it
it's a might be packaging a lot of them
if they have a nice black plate will
have
one of those on there you can pull that
off and save it for for the future they
might have little covers on the plugs
like your PCI Express connector there
sometimes also plugs covering up the eye
on the back I already move those from
this one and then other than the PCI
Express plug that's going to go in that
slot IO force which you're going to go
towards the back and then there's one
power plug on here PCI Express graphics
power or peg and you're going to want to
pay attention to where that is as well
so just aligning this with the slot
dropping it straight down in and
sometimes it kind of snaps in other
times it just kind of sits and rests in
the slot this one's just kind of sitting
in rest in there that's fine and then
you'll have a weight it's not that's not
all the way down in a what am I talking
about yeah that's big and then of course
we need some screws to screw in the back
which I believe these should fit
this entire big old graphics card will
be held in with two screws makes perfect
sense to me I made it is usually the
most expensive part of the computer and
this computer it is this graphics card
costs about well 220 to 280 dollars
depending on what version you get
whereas the CPU in here costs about a
hundred and sixty 165 right now so there
you go again links to all the parts I'm
using today are down in the video's
description as well as a PC part picker
list if you guys want to check them all
out I tried my best to update them all
so that they're accurate with what I'm
building today and since this graphics
card only have a single plug that gives
us a little bit more flexibility with
our cables here but just lining that up
look that in
that again has a little catch that will
hold and kind of snap into place and
then from there it's just a matter of
trying to tuck the cables away all right
so give you guys a look after the build
because you know what I'm almost done
not too bad it's only been about an hour
alright so again cables is it's it's
like there's not a lot of places to put
them in here but here's what you want to
focus on when it comes to the cable
management with this build remember you
got a fan right here it's going to be
pulling an air from the front that's
going to be supplying some area down
here to the graphics to the GPU which is
has its fans on the bottom as well as
some air up here into the main area so
that the CPU can keep cool so the power
supply has some air to pull through it
and then exhausted by this fan in the
back so it's just kind of a matter of
reality checking where stuff is and then
doing your best to take the extra cables
wherever that might be and tying them
back as best you can
again there's no exact science or exact
specific way you should do this every
time some cases have very specific ways
that they have been built so you can
very clearly see oh yes here's where the
cables are supposed to go other times
it's just a matter of like hey where can
I find some space and some room to shove
those cables and make it work
my main issue actually as far as looks
goes right now is at the top up here
that's uh there we go
alright obviously this isn't going to
win any awards on pin my PC but for the
most part it is it is complete so let's
I'm just trying to do like the most
simple push it to the side cable
management that I can since I don't
really have a lot of zip ties and twist
ties lying around here all right this
one I might like secure down there a
little bit more let's let's spend like a
couple seconds on this this 8 pin is
bothering me this can be better if you
can tuck stuff behind a motherboard tray
that is a perfectly viable option so
that helps all right I don't know how
much that did but there you go
yay cables sort of managed again this
case is just so small and easy to move
around and transport and stuff alright
let's do the final bit here which is
turning everything on I'm going to put
this side panel back on
yes yes that side panel is on I'm not
going to put this side panel on though
because that is a PC building
superstition if you put that panel on
then the system will boot properly all
right I do have a power cable down here
power goes in which way the switches
yeah switch should be on power button
which is power right loop aha
all right so ah so see here's here's one
of the issues of GPU sag the GPU sag is
sagging into the cables at the bottom so
alright there's my build now what I
would do at this point is obviously
those where there are some fan conflicts
down here at the bottom again that is
purely down to the cable management
which I could pull back a little bit
more depending on the situation with
this graphics card I might even have to
do something like pull the graphics
cried out and get those secured down to
the bottom a little bit more just
because there's quite a few of them all
plugging in along the bottom there and
one of them at least was conflicting
with the GPU fans you can't hear it
anymore because this graphics card when
there's no load on it the fans don't
spin at all so that's why it stops but
it works we got some LEDs going in there
we have yeah everything else is spinning
front fan is spinning rear fan rear
exhaust fan is spinning as well so I
would call that a successful build I
wouldn't say it's completely finished of
course but that wasn't really my goal
today my goal today was to get it all
put together after this is when you get
on to the finishing touches and the
polishing phase where you maybe go back
in there and we do the kiln management
pull stuff back a little bit more but
everything is functional now so I would
of course plug this into a monitor get
into the BIOS perhaps do a BIOS update
make sure the memory is being recognized
make sure everything is in there if you
guys are actually building this computer
which who knows maybe some of you are
then I would definitely recommend going
to my next video which would be the
first five things to do after you've
built a new computer that goes over
stuff like checking the BIOS and seeing
that the settings are the way that they
should be making sure the boss is
updated make sure making sure your
drivers are updated and just the basic
steps to getting like Steam installed
and all that kind of stuff and getting
up and running because often when you
get to this point people don't know
where to go next so I'll post a link to
that video if I remember down in the
description of this video and thanks a
lot you guys who are watching who tuned
in live I hope this hasn't been too
chaotic and I'm going to go I'm going to
go maybe maybe see if I can get Windows
installed on this system this has been
my $700 rise in bill
thanks you guys again so much for
watching hit thumbs up button if you
enjoyed the video
huge thanks Lyle you guys who tuned in
live and I'm already taking too long to
end this video so I have to go over
again and click a thing now don't mind
me just clicking this thing okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
