Pauls hardware today's video I am
actually trying to do two things with
the first thing should hopefully
obviously be in this title of the video
which is an unboxing and overview a
quick review of the mod Mike's bias by
antlion
but also I'm trying to do this video in
sort of a new style a different way it's
actually a style that's a little bit
easier for me to create because my goal
for 2017 is to up my video count per
week and to do hopefully four videos a
week instead of what I've been doing for
the past couple years which three videos
a week so if I can do this type of video
it means I can take products that are
maybe a little bit simpler that don't
require quite as much time and still do
a video on them also hopefully will give
me the ability to crank out another
video each week without affecting how
much time I have to invest with the
videos that I already do it's all that
being said let's get this out of the box
actually before the unboxing let's
quickly explain what these are for what
it does the mod Mike allows you to take
something like a set of headphones like
if these are and make them into a
headset like what this is because
headsets are kind of notoriously bad at
Privett providing good sound quality
although this one is definitely an
exception because these are by
Sennheiser but these are also quite
expensive Sennheiser has a nice set of
headsets that are all like the 200 to
$300 range that do a good job but the
primary difference between a headset
headphones is the existence of a
microphone so blue mic whoops down like
that on something like a headset
headphones you have a much wider variety
when it comes to your options and also
because these are made by lots of
different companies other than companies
that just make headsets that are
specifically for gaming these happen to
be some fostex t-50 RPS that were custom
modified by the kind folks over at
Mayflower electronics but you have lots
of options so it can give you the
ability to find a set of headphones that
you like a lot and then add the mod mic
v and voila you have yourself a headset
without the limiting factors that
headsets are known for which is often
poor quality and I think it has to do
with companies just being able to get
into the headset market very easily I
think there's a similarity there with
the
look with keyboards as well because I
just you find so many keyboard
manufacturers out there now and the same
with headsets and they're often just
really mediocre because it's not too
difficult for antlers to get everything
together to put together a headset
anyway here's everything that comes in
the box which is pretty much all this is
a wrap for the cables so since you are
going to be adding an additional wire
that is one of the slight downsides to
this configuration is like with a
headset dassault setup like this one
from sennheiser you have your analog
headphone and microphone jacks that are
just correct connected up correctly but
the mod Mike you're going to have an
extra cable coming from the mod like
itself which means that you're going to
have two cables coming off of your
headphones but they've done their best
to help you deal with that in that
they've given you a carrying case first
of all they've given you this wire wrap
so you can wrap up everything if you
want to set up a bit more of a permanent
solution or you can just use these
little clips that it comes with as well
which I believe are very straight down
here so a little kid of accessories
they're providing you gives you an
alcohol prep pad that's because you're
going to be using some adhesive to
connect the mod Mike Slive up to your
headphones and then I've also got these
magnetic pieces which again are well
magnetized so you can actually connect
that so it's got some pretty strong
adhesive there you just remove that and
put that on the side of your headphones
I'm just going to I'm just going to kind
of do this on the fly right now and
hopefully using the methods that they
recommend so I've cleaned off little
area that's what you're using adhesive
here you're probably going to want to
find the flattest and cleanest area you
can
although if you guys already spotted
Kyle's video on this since the bottom
like five actually came out back in
December and there's a couple videos I
don't it already
he actually connected it up to a part of
his headphones that actually looked more
like vistas on my Sennheiser's like
right there and it's still gripped on
there just fine so it's pretty good
adhesive and you should be okay I do
recommend going with the left side just
to stay where your cable will probably
also be coming out for the headphones
themselves and
here we go and actually before I go
ahead and pop that on although I have
already removed the heat adhesive
backing I'm going to connect it up to
the mods mic itself so you can see how
pretty strong magnet magnet will hold
this in place then this can rotate 90
degrees which is we're going to do to
flip it up or flip it back down so I'm
just connecting this up to make sure
that when I actually attach it unto here
it's going to be coming down at the
right angle and everything so here goes
okay so just with some firm pressure
there and the adhesive is going to stick
and now we have a microphone connected
up to our headphones now before I
finished setting all that up let's that
quickly go over the all the accessories
that are included now one of the
complaints was the earlier model mics
I'm on like for was that it came with a
very long cable and getting that sort of
tidied away and cable managed was
difficult so this time they've gone was
giving you a couple different extensions
so you can use one of these or both of
these depending on your what your needs
may be and that provides a little bit
more modularity and flexibility since
this is the mod mic next little carrying
case here as well hold up a little pouch
the antlion logo or antlion brand on it
well so that's pretty nice to have as
well if you do need to take this on the
go you do get an extra one of these guys
which is a little magnetic piece that
you actually connect to your headphones
so they have provided an extra which
could give you the flexibility to say
connect that up to a couple different
headphones and you know be able to pass
it back and forth between them or
replacements if you lose yours and then
of course an extra Luisa tab to connect
that up it's also nice to have because
as I've already done on this one it's
got a flip up feature again with that
magnet so when you flip it up or flip it
back down it will sort of stay in place
but I managed to put mine in a position
that where this is kind of conflicting
with that when I put it back this way so
it's not always staying on it again it's
a really powerful magnet so flipping up
is okay
flipping back just like I kind of get a
bit of a bump there so I might change
that Amanda let's see how much of a pain
that actually is but then also they give
you an in-line meet function so you have
a couple different functions you can
adjust with them on like this just mute
so again it's inline so just plug into
your eight-inch jacks where
you want it whether you want it right up
by your face or further down and then
you know just mutes audio on and off
antlion also sent over a couple
additional accessories these are not
included but possibly recommended if
needed so this one is a tip ring ring
sleeve jack that splits out a combo so
if you have a combo jack like on a
laptop or something with mic and
headphone in the same jack you can use
this to be able to plug in discreetly
your separates sources for your audio
clip mic in an audio line out and that
another thing that you might need is
well a good sound source from from the
get-go so depending on where your sound
is coming from or maybe if you don't
have that grade of audio solution in
your in your laptop then you could get
something like this which is just a
little USB sound card an external USB
sound card that provides mic and
headphone jacks again I'm not expecting
this to be on the level of quality of
like a really high-end external deck or
something like that but it can get you
up and running if you really only have
an audio or you only have a USB port but
you need the audio device as well and
these are all available in the inline
website if you're interested and that
here's a look at the actual mod mic boom
and mic itself installed as you can see
now you can actually undo the full piece
right here and flip it around if you
need to move it to the other side that
is an option or you can simply with the
included magnet just flip it all the way
around like that if you want if you did
need to flip the headphones around and
wear them out of the way depending on
how you have set up of course I like it
like this because usually the boom on a
headset is on the left side now it is
very flexible so you can take this and
bend it around however you want and it
does seem to stay very well in whatever
position that you put it in so that's a
flexible but stays nice and rigid once
you actually get it set up and then down
here you actually have the ability to
change let me just pop this off really
quick I have the ability to change the
mic configuration so you can do
unidirectional mode or omnidirectional
mode so if you want unidirectional you
have it in the position it's in right
now and that will give you a little bit
better performance if you're in a noisy
and
our mint this year say at a LAN party or
something like that and there's lots of
noise going on or flip it back to
omnidirectional mode and that will give
you better noise quality overall but
that's going to be less useful in a
noisy environment so because it will
pick up lots of stuff that's around you
it does come with a wind protection and
pop filter there on the microphone
itself and then that's pretty much you
know all there is to it it's a fairly
simple design but also fairly effective
and let's say iOS actually put it into
practice and give it give it a try
actually before we do the test here's a
quick look at the wiring setup at least
now as I have it set up now bear in mind
this is sort of a different set of
headphones because this does have a 1/8
inch jack on the headphones themselves
so you know by that mine but as you can
see I've used a little blacks to just
sort of connect these up and wear them
together going down the line
so obviously this isn't the cleanest
solution so depending on how picky you
are about your cable management you may
or may not want to go with this route or
again that is part of the reason they
included this stuff here was so you can
actually give yourself a bit more of a
permanent solution by wrapping this
around but this stuff is pretty like
thick and it's already you know it's
already kind of pre rolled into this
loop right here so you need to kind of
undo that and then feed the cable
through it and then you can cut this
link if you need to and you know maybe
use these lighter to seal up the end
there if you also need to do that but
there is plenty I'm not going to do that
for now because I don't want quite that
much of a permanent solution but anyway
here this is set up for now and the boom
is even topping up and down without too
much difficulty just like that
and here it is guys my full new
headphone turned into headset
configuration and you're actually
hearing the mod mic 5 right and I have
it plugged in directly to the camera and
I'm an omnidirectional mode which should
provide a little bit better sound
quality but again it's going to pick up
more ambient noise around me fortunately
it's fairly quiet here in the garage
hero is not snoring at this point but we
also have of course you need directional
modes let me switch over that all right
this is unidirectional mode so again
it's going to be more directed towards
my face to pick up what I'm saying and
pick up less of what's around me but
the sound quality is probably going to
be reduced just ever so slightly now I
don't have a mod mic force to compare
this to so if you guys are looking for
some more side-by-side comparisons I've
mentioned our de that Kyle has already
did a video on this particular product
so I'm going to link that in the
description because he does a
side-by-side comparison with the mod mic
for because this might be something that
a lot of people are considering
upgrading from to come over to this now
this mod mic 5 cost 70 bucks right now
directly from the antlion website and
that's a little steep if you're
considering that your headphones are
going to cost probably 80 to 120 hundred
fifty dollars for a decent set of
headphones add that cost on top of it
you're again getting yourself up into
that price range where you could
potentially get like a nice set of
Sennheiser's or something like that so
it is going to be up to the individual
whether they think it is worth that cost
you can still get the mod mic for 450
bucks so that's still a pretty good deal
in the sound quality really is pretty
minor when it comes to the upgrade the
upgrade save Medicade it's more of a
functionality improvement that they've
done with the mod mic 5 so I think this
is mainly going to be suited for people
who really have a favorite pair of
headphones and I really want to keep
them and I like listening to music and
games and whatever else with it but they
also like man it'd be nice if I had
headsets or a mic option with this that
wasn't like a desktop one so that I
could play games with it and talk to
people online but that's gonna wrap it
up here guys so let me know of course
what you think of them on mic 5 let me
know what you think of this style of
video production that I have done today
because again it was a little bit more
on the fly I think I got some decent
information out there for you guys but
it's a little bit easier for me to
produce so again hopefully this is
hitting that mid-range between a good
video for you guys a little bit easier
of a time for me and getting you guys
some more content as we proceed in 2017
of course it sums up button if you
enjoyed the video leave me comments in
the comment section and let me know
again what you think of this product or
of my video style and links are down in
the description for this product in my
store and all that good stuff thanks
again for watching guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
