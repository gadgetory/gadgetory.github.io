make an appointment to come in to handle
Texas for this year last year in this
Wednesday morning or Thursday morning
would be ideal for us
let's do Thursday at 10:00 awesome all
right thanks Jeff
today is one of those days where I have
lots of little random things to do so I
thought I'd make a video about it take
you guys along for the ride taxes are
scheduled so that's good
if a boring adult thing Jo is here as
well and special surprise event it is
Nora's birthday today isn't it yes it is
each new his birthday are you excited
he's he's very standoffish also of note
is that I was up really late last night
finishing up the gtx 1660 TI review
which just posted this morning at least
as of when this video is being filmed so
check that i guess if you missed it so i
didn't get a whole lot of sleep but i
wanted today to be a good day and for me
a good day has sort of changed and
evolved over time with what it's meant
it used to mean like staying home and
shirking responsibilities and playing
video games and i still kind of does but
now that i've grown up a little bit more
and i guess got a little bit more
responsible a good day entails a few
different things first you got to do
something you hear you get some work
done accomplish a goal of some type ii i
want to do something outside maybe a
little bit of exercise and third of
course well we got to play some video
games so try to take care of responsible
things tax appointment that was one now
going to the bank because i have a bunch
of checks to deposit their weird chicks
I'd like a class-action lawsuit that
sent me a couple checks that are weird
and I get checks from Amazon UK which
are in pounds great British pounds so I
always have to bring those in to the
bank to deposit which is fine but you
know every few months I do that they're
crossing us weakened by the PIO box and
maybe also try to get nori a birthday
present since she is turning eight today
and then also I think one of the most
important
oh and then I think one of the most
important things that I have been
thinking about for a while is work on my
house in order to do proper work on my
house
I need plans for my house so we're gonna
try to go by City Hall and see if I can
purchase them my house was built in the
60s that might be available it might not
if it is available I want them if it's
not I'm gonna have to hire like an
architect to come out and draw them up
next up few bucks not much of the LPO
box today but I didn't get a damn son so
say hell did not have my blueprints
unfortunately but I did learn some
valuable information about steps moving
forward for work on my house and making
a patio cover and some other stuff
whenever I tell people I live in Diamond
Bar they always seem like oh that sounds
really fancy Diamond Bar but actually
fun facts Diamond Bar was a ranch
originally and Diamond Bar comes from
the brand that the rancher used on the
cattle which was a diamond on top with a
bar underneath or you know because here
in America we spoil our pets they're
basically children so you're gonna get a
cake for the dog right okay yeah getting
here toy toy
this is important where you're almost
out of blue bags here it needs the big
ones any special trick to picking out a
toy for a dog especially when you're
done as a dog with you so what do you
think get the Koala care I can't destroy
this quickly it's cute yeah the plush
toys they turn into big big balls of
fluff very quickly this squeeze me yeah
whoopee violent with the collagen
speaker no he hates the squeakers she'll
working until she digs it out this is
kind of a dead squirrel
I like that also with the squeaker
I found this Hedgehog which I think nori
would just be really cute running around
with and it makes a grunt rather than
that annoying high-pitched squeak all
right I could be a winner doggy treats
some treats here too big poo bags we got
this Hedgehog she's
Oh duper butter mozzarella and red sauce
we had a pineapple available here I say
no no pineapple on pizza it's unnatural
I'm not having it
I'm gonna get garlic olives artichokes
you get pineapple Jim just to piss
people off I'll be an interesting
combination okay I take peppers peppers
do a half pineapple pineapple Joe I'm
interested to see how it goes yeah let's
see what kind of comments again it's
what time is it it doesn't matter who
cares beer it's beer o'clock it's ready
mango flavored Komarov mango mango mango
tart it says there's mine looking very
appropriately well balanced then we got
Jose over here which is very colorful I
would say RGB but you miss him blue
dressing my editing style you all
understand I end up less your ban on
this lots of colors make it very
exciting it's got everywhere
he's beer
swish it all around beautiful it really
taste the pineapple for it
darling
I rode my beer
we are back gets leftover pizza I do
we're gonna take the dogs out right now
but first I gotta clear this stuff out
of playing the back of my trick what are
you what is that guy's it was so quick
that's a tic-tac for him Baro

me get the tag for uniting Shana's my
toe she really doesn't like text like
show go after it okay
Eggar she's happy
some wall not here so here they are this
is just a teaser but I got more wood
from Sallee peak timber and they're all
pieces of walnut longer slabs and I
specifically chose these so I can make
shelves out of them so to go along with
this piece which is what the htpc is
going to be mounted to these are
specifically chosen because they're
wider on one side and that's so I can
hopefully set a receiver on top of it
but that's coming in a future video I
promise soon
asterisk very soon never heard him make
that sound before
arrow
era
don't bother me if so styles are excited
we're at Pantera Park not to be confused
with Pantera pork just heavy-metal bacon
just such a thing so after consuming
large amounts of pizza and a beer burn
off the calories by throwing balls and
walking around with us yeah exactly you
know at the ball here is not interested
in the ball nope
