work out here in the garage projects and
kind of wrap things up usually about
Friday sometimes I'm working by myself
sometimes I have Joe my editor here
working here with me and then I sort of
say the same thing I'm gonna get this
stuff cleaned up over the weekend and
then on Monday we can start fresh but
doesn't always work out that way it's
way more common for it to end up looking
like this what happened this last week
was this was my work area over here and
so this became the discard area
everything that I needed to just get out
of the way I was setting there so I was
supposed to clean all this up over the
weekend but with the baby coming soon I
didn't have any time to do that so today
I am trying to keep the to-do list
relatively short and simple although
it's gonna take some time so first off
I'm just gonna clean I have some time
here by myself this morning because I
sent Joe to Micro Center to pick up a
few key components for the second part
which is going to be building a couple
systems again in the dr. zaber century
2.0 case a case is actually available
now in IndieGoGo so I'll put a link to
that down in the video's description I'm
not building in it again because I
haven't given it enough coverage I've
already done two separate videos on it
but they sent me two of the cases I have
a 1 million subscriber giveaway coming
up very soon as soon as my plaque
actually arrives and I wanted to do a
personally built system as part of that
giveaway too so that's what I'm going to
be building that system for let's get
started
well I can't say everything's perfectly
clean but this is way way way better
than it was before so it's always the
nice dispense a bit of time tidying
things up and I've been gathering parts
over here for the doctors a burr build
and I think perfect timing
who's just arrived walking into frame
perfectly come on Joe hey so Joe's here
thank you Joe he grabbed this processor
which is the 9600 K I which is
overclockable so it's gonna go good with
the motherboard and I did you get a
power supply yeah I didn't that's fine
so it's okay that we still have an SF
six hundred power supply for the
giveaway build so we can get that all
put together and part of the reason I'm
doing this for a giveaway I am gonna be
shipping it so smaller the better that's
always nice and then dr. Hebert
originally sent me two of these cases
they have it in the classic black and
then they have this gray finish looks
kind of like an aircraft carrier or a
fighter jet or something like that and I
have done a poll to see which of these
two cases which finish the fans wants
the opportunity to potentially win for a
giveaway let's check the results the
poll still has a ways to go but it looks
like black is definitely the favor it
was 64 percent of the votes so far with
about close to 800 people weighing in so
I think we're gonna go with the classic
black here for the giveaway and then I
will be setting up a portable system for
myself to use in situations in the
future when I need to take it on the
road and such in the gray system so that
means I have two builds to assemble now
one is gonna be a giveaway and guys I
know I've already done a build in the
sabre-tooth century 2.0 so apologies for
doing another one but hopefully you'll
forgive me since one of them's gonna be
a giveaway and then mine I'll be able to
get together most of the way but not
quite completely until I get that power
supply I think we're just about ready to
go now rebuilding continuing to build
building new but yeah I guess it's kind
of turning into a more standard build
video at this point that wasn't really
my intent but that's okay because that's
really what my channel is about most of
the time so I'm sure you guys hopefully
don't mind too much let me quickly go
over the parts one more time starting
with the giveaway system the case of
course the dr. xaviar century 2.0 in
black for a graphics card the winner
will get the GeForce r-tx 2070 and this
is that gigabyte mini version hundred
and seventy millimeter so yes I'm going
with the small graphics card for the
build as well as the liquid cooler for
the CPU the h-60 from corsair paired up
with this nfa 12 X 15 PWM van from
Noctua and I will be flipping the fan
this time around because apparently when
I originally did the build on this I had
the fan not in the optimal position it's
not a huge difference but it should give
a little bit better thermal performance
with its flipped so that's nice
sticking with Intel for this build so
the RG strict C 390 - I gaming from Asus
will be the motherboard there it is
right there it actually still has the
8700 K in it but I will be removing that
and dropping in the 9600 k reason for
that being that the 9600 K is an
unlocked overclockable 6 core processor
which is very good for gaming and that
8700 K says Intel confidential on it
which means it's an engineering sample
which is the one that they provided me
and you're not really supposed to like
give those away or anything like that
you're supposed to hang on to them if
those are provided to you by Intel so
I'm sticking to that for memory we're
gonna continue to use the Kingston
HyperX predator kit right here ddr4 3200
speed for an SSD we're going with the
Intel 660 P and this is the one terabyte
version of that and then the power
supply this little coarser SF 600 SFX
power supply which is 80 + platinum
rated and also comes with nicely sleeved
cable so I don't know if you guys notice
that in last video but it's good cabling
on this virus play the secondary build
over here is going to be an AMD system
and that's gonna be based around this or
SB 450 I Pro Wi-Fi motherboard which has
a m4 socket has Wi-Fi included also has
MDOT too so it's gonna be a great sort
of core for this build and I'm going to
be adding a rise in 7 processor to it
this is the 2700 X my idea for this
system is that it might be multi-use if
I take it on the road I'm probably not
just gonna be gaming with it but also
doing video editing so more cores and
threads is always good to have now it
might be slightly hard to keep that cool
in a case this small if you guys watched
my original video my testing video
things can't get warm in here
I am still gonna be using the cryo rig
c7 low profile cooler unfortunately I
have the a m4 upgrade kit for that this
was actually sent by a fan a while back
so thank you to the fan who sent this in
it's actually coming in handy at this
point obviously this isn't gonna be the
best cooling but I think given the case
size and everything it will get the job
done and you know my down clock slightly
when I'm doing rendering or something
like that but I have no problem with
that I'd rather rather have the extra
cores and threads
remember yet we have AG skills sniper X
kit this is 3400 speed memory which is
Rison compatible so faster memory is
always good to have on this platform and
I still don't have an SSD graphics card
or power supply but for this build yet
but since it's going to be kind of a
work in progress anyway I can add those
at a later date at the least I will get
the system initially put together and of
course I will be finishing off the
giveaway built so let's get started and
put these rigs together
we're going on the second build now the
AMD system and this is sort of a unique
conflict that I'm encountering here you
guys probably won't see it but I'm using
this upgrade kit for the Type C upgrade
kit for the cryo rig c7 which is our
little low-profile cooler right here
the main difference here is that these
little brackets that attach to the
bottom they've supplied different ones
that have four mounting holes and then
they also provide this separate back
bracket it's plastic but this is the
original this is the a m4 one you notice
how kind of wide this bracket is and
that's because it's got that sort of X
shape on the back with the wider
mounting locations and that's for Intel
sockets and then this sort of
rectangular part in the middle is for
AMD sockets but when I position this on
the back of this motherboard we've got
some surface mount components at here
and then up here that are conflicting
with it so I could just mount it that
way anyway and drill through tighten it
down but it would be tightening the
backplate up against these components
and that's just not a good idea but
since I still have this backup backplate
which will work for Intel sockets if
this cooler ever needs to get reused in
the future I'm just going to cut pieces
off of the ends of this to make room for
those components and only really concern
myself with the AMD mounting part of
this one
so guys the title of this video is this
happens way too often and you know some
things do happen pretty frequently here
it gets messy I got to clean it up
computer parts come in I got to build
computers out of them what doesn't
happen very often is me hitting 1
million subscribers and yes I know I've
been mentioning that multiple times over
the past three or four weeks since it
actually happened but I'm just trying to
delay long enough so that when I
actually do the million subscriber thank
you giveaway which is coming very soon
you guys won't have forgotten that that
actually happened in the past so that is
coming soon as soon as my gold play
button arrives here from YouTube and yes
this system here the one on the right
with the 9600 K and an Archie X 27 T
will be one of the prizes up for grabs
international it'll be great so stay
tuned for that thank you guys so much
for watching this video hit the thumbs
up button on your way out
and we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
