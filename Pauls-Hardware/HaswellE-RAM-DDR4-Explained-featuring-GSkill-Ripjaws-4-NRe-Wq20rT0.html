have a g.skill ripjaws for quad-channel
4x4 gigabyte 2666 speed kit right here
this is my has well ii x99 platform
video all about ddr4 memory and I
welcome you to also check out my CPU and
motherboard videos which feature JJ ddr4
is the fourth generation SDRAM standard
agreed upon by the J deck Council of
memory manufacturers and x99 is the
first consumer PC platform that uses it
I'll assume that you already know that
memory is very fast but not in permanent
storage that your computer uses as a
resource pool to store data for actively
running programs and services and move
on to what ddr4 actually brings to the
table the three key improvements in ddr4
our power consumption data transfer
speed and density for power consumption
improvement ddr4 uses 20% less
electrical power than ddr3 operating at
1.2 volts instead of 1.5 ddr4 also has
support for a special new deep power
down mode they can reduce standby power
consumption by 40 to 50 percent this
will actually be extremely helpful for
servers because they use many memories
and consume a lot of power as for
transfer speed while ddr4 on x99 starts
at 21 33 speed stock and already
manufacturers like g.skill have kits
with speeds up to 3200 although
manufacturing processes still need to be
refined
we should eventually see speeds hit 4000
and beyond density is a benefit that we
won't see immediately but there's a lot
of potential there this is a 16 gigabyte
kit for example which is already pretty
much a standard configuration with ddr3
but with double the density and the
ability for ddr4 to support eight dies
per package instead of four
theoretically the standard can actually
support up to 512 gigabytes per module
but again the manufacturing needs to
mature although 16 gigabyte and 32
gigabyte DIMMs are really not out of the
question in the near future here's a
closer look at the Ripjaws 4 kit and I
do want to point out that this is also
available in blue and black as well as
the red that you see here these have a
module height of 40 millimeters and also
feature XMP 2.0 support to help
you easily reach their rated speeds at
2666 these modules have a nice speed
boost overstock 2133 sticks as well as
timings of 15 15 15 35 physically ddr
modules have a 288 pin edge connector
which is physically incompatible with
the 240 pin layout from ddr3 apart from
that you'll find them to be physically
very similar and installation remains
one of the easier tasks in building a pc
some have questioned whether a ddr4
memory is useful for a desktop PC given
that most current generation systems
don't really see much of a benefit and
increased memory speed beyond about 1866
on ddr3 but x99 is intel's enthusiast
platform and I don't really see folks
investing in this unless they're
actually running enterprise level type
applications that gain and benefit from
it or they're just crazy pc junkies like
you and me who appreciate every small
benchmark bump that a new technology can
provide unfortunately due to a spike in
demand and the inevitably slow ramp up
time in ddr4 memory production this will
be a premium product with a very high
price tag in the first year or so we
will see it level out over time though
and we can't expect price parity with
ddr3 in about 2016 so what do you think
of ddr4 if you're going for x99 it's a
must-have that do you think the benefits
are worth it let me know in the comments
section like and share this video if you
have learned anything useful
check out my CPU and motherboard videos

Kyle's channel of course for a full x99
build and as always thank you for
