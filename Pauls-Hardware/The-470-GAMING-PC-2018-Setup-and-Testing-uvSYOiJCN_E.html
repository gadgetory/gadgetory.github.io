the description what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware today's video is
my follow-up to what was originally my
February build then I need to start off
by saying a big apology to you guys
because I know this is a lot later than
I was originally intending to put it out
I've been out of the loop for a little
bit but I'm back so thanks a lot you
guys for bearing with me and today I'm
going to show you guys a little bit more
details about the setup of this build
and then I'm also going to do some
demonstrations just showing you the
basic performance if you're planning to
build a gaming PC and you want to do an
APU based PC because graphics cards are
so expensive right now I think this is a
great solution for anyone who's just
trying to get their foot in the door and
then of course have a lot of upgrade
potential in the future so all the parts
in this system were all assembled about
a month ago and the link to that video
I'll put in the description as well as a
list to all the parts that I've used now
at the end of that first video I
directed you guys over to my first five
things to do with a new PC build video
and that should have helped you get
things set up but every computer that
you build yourself is gonna be a little
different
might have quirks so I'm gonna start off
with some things to know and the one big
one that I've already gotten a few
comments on and a few tweets about is
the potential BIOS incompatibility issue
so here's the situation right now we
have these new AMD APU s the Rison 320
200 G and the rise in 520 400 G these
came out in January 2018 the
motherboards that they're compatible
with are gonna be your beef be 350
chipset motherboards and your X 370
chipset motherboards those came out a
year ago now if you happen to have an
older motherboard a be 350 chipset
motherboard or an X 370 chipset
motherboard e there's like a 320 as well
but I typically recommend B 350 or X 370
now if your motherboard was manufactured
and shipped to a retailer sometime in
2017 then it has an older bios version
on it and what you need to do is take
your old your motherboard with old BIOS
update the BIOS on it so that it will
recognize and be compatible with your
new
you this situation is going to happen
again in another month or two
once the rise in two processors launch
we'll have the same situation because
you have a bunch of rising two CPUs like
the theoretically the 2800 X and so
forth that will be compatible with
existing B 350 and X 370 motherboards
but if the motherboard was shipped
earlier and has an older BIOS on it the
BIOS needs to be updated first in order
to recognize the CPU that puts you in
kind of a catch-22 situation because in
order to update the BIOS you need to
install a CPU to get the board up and
running so long story short older be 350
motherboards that shipped in 2017 might
need and updates to be compatible with
the newer 2200 g-20 400 G Rison + vague
ap use and in the future even rise in
two CPUs as well that might come out and
most be 350 and X 370 motherboards have
an updated BIOS available but you'll
need to install an older CPU first in
order to boot up and update your board
and then install your 2200 year 2400 G
so for example the board that's used in
this build the AP 350 in gaming Wi-Fi if
we go over to the support page on
gigabytes you'll notice down here under
BIOS there's nine older versions and in
fact the first versions came out back in
June or so as when the motherboard
launched and it wasn't until late 2017
or beginning of 2018 that we have what's
we have Raven Ridge CPU supports so in
December and then we have some more
updated ones that have come out after
the fact as well if your motherboard has
a f5 BIOS or older and then you can't
install and recognize a current gen apu
into it now there are three solutions to
solving this problem if you happen to be
stuck in it solution one involves some
four thoughts so if you've already
bought your hardware then this probably
won't help you but before purchasing
your motherboard make sure the
motherboard says AMD rise in desktop
2000 ready AMD has published some
stickers that they might put on the box
or the motherboard manufacturer might
put a sticker on the box that says Raven
Ridge ready this might be difficult to
confirm with online purchases though so
you might also want to double check if
you're shopping on new AG or Amazon that
they've put some extra text in there
that indicates the motherboard that's
going to ship to you is compatible or is
updated to be compatible with these new
Raven Ridge ap use the second solution
if your motherboard has arrived and it's
not updated
then it's just not gonna work you'll
install everything like I showed you in
the first video and then it won't put up
or you get a blank screen now if you
don't happen to have a slightly older
1000 series rise and CPU on a hand your
fastest solution is probably gonna be
your local PC repair shop most PC repair
shops will update your BIOS for you if
you bring the motherboard in they might
charge you a small fee I've heard five
to fifteen dollars and by the way if you
happen to be a PC repair shop owner out
there consider offering a BIOS update
service for free especially with the
rise in two stuff coming out it will
make a good impression on potential new
customers and it is a great way to get
that potential customer to hang out and
browse your store for five or ten
minutes while they wait for you to do be
very simple update the third solution is
direct from AMD and they will actually
lend you an older Bristol Ridge apu so
this is an APU that has older
architecture but it is functional it
costs about sixty seventy dollars if you
were to buy it at retail but if you
contact AMD you send them proof of your
purchase and they will ship you a
dual-core a six ninety five hundred you
can install that update your board and
then they will provide a shipping label
to return that loaner CPU back to them
it does take a week or two to get to you
gamers Nexus recently tested and this as
a consumer so if you don't have time to
wait that long then the first or second
option are probably going to be a better
bet for you since I knew I was okay on
the BIOS update issue on this board in
particular I pretty much set up the
system according to that first five
things to do with a new-build video now
I also installed an 8 gig memory kits
the original kit that I installed if you
guys remember was a g.skill Flair X kit
and these are each eight gig dims and I
wanted to test in the same configuration
as I recommend it to you guys so I've
just swapped out for these this is just
a g.skill ripjaws 5 kit 4 gigs per dims
so 8 gigs total 2x4 and that's so I
could test the configuration that I'm
recommending you guys actually buy 4 sub
of $500 now if you've got the team kits
that I recommended in the first video
then in order to get the memory running
at the right speed you can just go into
the BIOS and plug in the XMP settings as
per my first five things video I
actually went in and manually set the
speed on this memory to run at ddr4 3000
so it would be the same speed as the kit
that you might get at home and that way
we can hopefully get about the same
performance as you might expect
as well let me show you guys how I've
set this up in the BIOS so I've not
jumped into the BIOS also known as UEFI
and here is where we can change some of
the core settings of the motherboard and
how the CPU works in the memory
frequency and that kind of thing now
this usually has a graphical interface
so you can actually use your mouse and
your keyboard to navigate around but for
those of you who need to update the BIOS
just to give you guys a quick tip on
that you're basically gonna need a USB
Drive I recommends plugging it in to a
different computer and formatting it
fat32 is the file format you want to use
once you've had a fat32 USB Drive go to
that gigabyte download page I already
showed you download the latest update
put it on the USB Drive and then from in
here you can use the cue flash option in
order to update and that will basically
access your Drive you tell it what the
file is and you can do an update from
there since I don't have a drive
installed it's not even letting me do
that but wanted to show you where that's
listed at least beyond that I wanted to
talk about memory so here we can look at
frequency settings we can see for
example that our CPU is installed and
the clock speed on its and here's where
we would plug in that XMP profile
extreme memory profile if we wanted to
so just switch to profile one and you
would be good to go I didn't do that
here though simply because I did it
manually I just set my memory profile
multiplier to thirty which gives us a
speed of three thousands and then I said
the cast cast latency to 15 because that
is what the memory kit is actually rated
for beyond that you can do the other
steps that I mentioned in my first five
video browsing through the BIOS if you
want to I would definitely recommend
checking your boot options making sure
that that's proper I've only got one
option for booting and I've got two
because I've plugged in an external SSD
as well but beyond that Windows
installation everything should go the
same way that I showed in that video so
let's save and exit and now here we are
back in Windows I've skipped over a lot
of stuff that just because it's included
in that other video but I went to the
gigabytes website and downloaded drivers
where applicable specifically for the
chipset and that kind of thing those
have all been installed and I saved them
here also got the Bluetooth and the
Wi-Fi installed there I did want to
point out for this mother
in particular there appears to be a
minor glitch that might happen with the
default Wi-Fi drivers that Windows 10
downloads so definitely go to the
gigabyte website download those Wi-Fi
drivers and install those because they
definitely are a lot more stable for me
beyond that you're also gonna want to
make sure that you have the proper
driver for your graphic would be the
graphics card but since it's the APU its
included as part of the CPU but for that
you can go over to the AMD website and
go to drivers and supports and you can
do the automatic detection thing if you
want to I tend to like to tell it
manually that I have an APU and that
it's a desktop APU and it's a Rison 3
with Vega because it's the 2200 and I'm
using Windows 10 64 bits and there it
will give me the results I can double
check down here that it's the proper
actual CPUs that are compatible and then
click on download there narcho to
install that driver once that package is
installed you can right click on the
desktop and go to AMD Radeon settings
and here you can access some of the
functions of the Radeon software such as
the Radeon overlay you can establish
profiles for different games that you
play how it handles video for example
display scaling that kind of thing as
well as just looking at your system
setup whether its overview software its
installed updates for like OpenGL open
CL and mantle and volcán for example and
then also you can look at the hardware
that you have installed which if you
have the 2200 G is a Vega 8 graphics
units and you can see different
revisions and other stuff in there now
one of the functions in the BIOS is to
assign your integrated graphics a
certain amount of memory that's
allocated from the amount of memory that
you installed so since we have 8 gigs of
ddr4
we are going to allocate some of that
that's specifically set aside for the
video or video card and the rest of the
system can't use that so that's why if
we were to for example go to my PC and
look at properties we could see we have
8 gigs of installed ram and we have six
point nine five gigs usable some of
that's being used by the graphics and
some of that is being used by system
resources resources that you can't touch
depending what you're doing with your
system seven gigs may or may not be
enough so if we go over here to our
ask manager we can take a look for
example at the amount of memory that's
being used right now of our 6.9 gigs
we're currently using 2.2 gigs
just with the operating system up and
running we're not really doing anything
I mean I guess I have chrome loaded so
there's some chrome tabs basically but
the point I'm getting at is that it's
important to keep an eye on your system
what it is doing how it is behaving and
what's resources are being used that way
you can get a better idea of like
alright is it time to upgrade or is this
okay for my purposes now if we actually
go to logical processors we can see the
four cores of our processor and what
they're doing task manager is a nice
basic functional way of doing this but
what I actually did for this system and
for our continued testing today as I
downloaded some additional software so
apart from our Andy Radeon drivers i've
also went to the msi website and
downloaded afterburner and then i've
gone to the guru 3d website and i've
downloaded the rivatuner statistics
server I've also gone to hardware info
HW infocom to download HW info 64 and
I'm running that as well when I ran all
of those it can give me a good idea of
what's going on with my system and the
reason I'm using this software is simply
because it's a little bit easier with
the software to monitor stuff while
you're playing a game there's a ton of
stuff that you can do with this software
so I'm not going to go into all of it
but basically over here you get a view
at a lot of different sensors that are
on the board and what's going on so for
instance your CPU is right here and you
can see the different cores and the
voltage that's being delivered to each
core you can also look at the core clock
and it's got a current min Max and
average so right now it's just idling
not doing much so about 1.6 gigahertz
but when it actually ramps up when it
when you tell the CPU to do something
it's actually going up to about 3.7
gigahertz and if we wanted it to go
higher than that then we could overclock
to possibly go even beyond that but I'll
hopefully cover that in a different
video
beyond that we can also see usage per
core and we can see that we've only
really gotten up to about sixty three
point four percent usage on any core
right now that's because I haven't
really done with much with this right
now you can also take a look at your
memory that's installed we can see the
memory speed here running it
fifteen hundred megahertz or about that
double data rate memory so it's actually
running at three thousand speed and then
we can also see our CPU temperature for
example it's a good idea to keep an eye
on that to make sure things don't get
too warm
then we've got more stuff from the
motherboard the motherboard has lots of
different sensors on its but if we keep
scrolling down we can find our GPU
listed right here the AMD Radeon Vega
eight here we can also see GPU
temperature and we can also see stuff
like the GPU clock speed the GPU memory
clock speed GPU utilization so what I'm
gonna do is tell hardware info 64 to use
the rivatuner statistics server to
actually show the value for some of
these things and then when I load up
some games we can monitor these stats as
we're playing the game alright so the
first game I'm testing here is Grand
Theft Auto 5 the classic GTA 5 which
runs just five on this one just fine on
the 2,200 G if a little bit less than 60
frames per second at low settings or
these are normal settings at 1080p on
the games a 1920 by 1080 today GTA 5 is
one you might consider just dropping the
resolution down to 720 or something a
little bit lower if you want it a little
bit better framerate but let's look at
these settings that I'm rolling with in
GTA 5 when it comes to the graphics
we're at 1920 by 1080 ignore suggested
limits 60 Hertz and pretty much
everything else is set to either the
lowest or normal settings which is
pretty much as low as it can go just a
quick look at it there and then also
advanced graphics right everything but I
do want to point out when it comes to
the on screen display here up the top
left there direct3d 11 here's just a
frame rate so we're looking for an
average frame rate around 60 frames per
second above that if possible our CPU
stats are also listed here so we can see
the frequency the load as well as the
current temperature memory and this is
system memory we can see how much is
under load right there as well as the
overall percentage and then for our GPU
we can see the temperature the frequency
as well as the load and then I've got
dedicated as well as dynamic vram
dedicated is what we have told it to use
and then dynamic is if it goes over that
it can use up a little bit more now it
comes to the memory for the graphics
card you can
the dedicated and dynamic dedicated
supposed to be what you assign to the
graphics card that it will set aside for
you to use and then dynamic means if it
determines that it's all being used up
it might use a little bit more up and
that means it's going to steal some from
what's available for your operating
system so it is something to keep in
mind right now we're only using about
four gigs of RAM on this on the CPU side
so overall we're only using about five
five to six gigs which means we're
probably okay
but depending on the game you're playing
you might use more memory and in that
case is when you might consider a memory
upgrade so after driving down the
highway for a little bit I can tell that
first off we are definitely GPU limited
with this game we can see the GPU
percentage there is hovering it around
well just below 100% so the GPUs max
depth CPU we're getting about 60 to 70
percent usage on so that's not bad it
means we've got a little bit of headroom
there even though we're just using the
quad core and then beyond that frame
rate as mentioned it's dip in a little
bit below 60 frames per second here and
there but overall it's a pretty smooth
experience GTA 5 was a game that in my
initial testing of the Raven River Ridge
launch it was a little bit better suited
for the 2400 G compared to the 2200 G
but again it's still very playable and
even at the low settings GTA 5 still
looks pretty good boys chat muted
alright next up we are playing pub G and
always remember ctrl T to avoid a mute
voice chat Pub G is not a very well
optimized game and I discovered this in
my initial video as well it's pretty
difficult to get a reasonably playable
framerate playing it 1920 by 1080 with
the 2200 gene then this game so to that
end I have gone and set all of my
settings to very low and you can see him
right here at 1920 by 1080 playing a
full screen everything set to very low I
got vsync off so that's that's what
we're working it's right here I'm
already being attacked this guy think he
is want you back
so I'm gonna play through one round here
I think see let's see if I can get a
chicken chicken dinner maybe I've never
won pub G all right already I can tell
that we're above our memory limits or
using our full gig of dedicated vram and
we're already using 680 on top of that
as well as five point two five point
three gigs of our dedicated RAM in the
green there so that's getting pretty
close to like using up all the memory
and that's definitely gonna be an issue
with this game especially as it seems
like as I get closer to a town here or
something with a little bit more
structures loading in we're just using
up more and more so if there is gonna be
something that causes the framerate to
tank it's going to be having to fetch
textures and that kind of thing from the
sort storage drive even though it's
fetching it off of an SSD I can
definitely impact frame rates but anyway
I've at least landed and we're bouncing
back and forth between 16 ish so I
haven't feeling well our normal frame
rate we're getting is a little bit above
30 which again is playable if not ideal
but if you've seen those dips where it
goes down to like 16 or something like
that see you'll notice it's not
happening right now because I'm just
kind of in an area that I everything's
loaded into but when it was loading
stuff as when we got the frame rate dips
I also have an Xbox controller plugged
in that I did for grand theft auto which
is why I'm seeing Xbox control commands
pop up on screen instead of the normal
keyboard and mouse which is confusing me
yeah at least I threw a throw smoke bomb
at him I think so obviously inspired
some fear but pop G's challenging as it
is though especially with a little
framerate so let's switch over to
fortnight alright guys I've moved over
to fortnight and battle royale and right
now we're just in the pre loading area
everything on screen is the same as it
was before we're in the bus now so I
wanted to quickly show you the settings
I'm using we're at 1920 by 1080 window
full screen and everything is set to
medium although I'm only getting around
40 frames per second so I'm actually
gonna switch most this to low and off
right now just to see
if we can't help us ourselves out a
little bit when it comes to the frame
rate that they'd seem to help we're up
to 60 now so I'm gonna attempt to play
fortnight now I'm not very good at it
Wow there's lots of people lots of
people diving in should be fun
alright so we're using a decent amount
of memory we're at 5 a little over 5
gigs of memory and I should probably
pick up those bandages and I should
probably have some idea of what I'm
doing in this game beyond that though
video memory is looking pretty decent
we're not even up to a gig which is one
of the nice things about this game is it
is not very difficult to play you don't
need a whole lot of system resources or
anything like that so so that's
definitely a nice great thing we're
holding pretty steady at 60 frames per
second in fact so steady that I feel
like vsync might be on hold on
these things off vsync saw fit was just
giving me real solid 30 frames 30 FPS
okay
what a jerk okay well I died which is
probably a good thing because I was just
getting distracted anyway point being
fortnight Battle Royale perfectly
playable nice two solid 60 frames per
second frame rate as long as you keep
the settings down too though time to
jump in overwatch here and let's take a
quick look at the settings I'm using
fullscreen or again we're in 1920 by
1080 overwatch has a pretty robust
system for adjusting your settings in
order to get yourself a good frame rate
so I've actually just gone and sets the
graphics quality to the low presets and
I turned off the frame rate cap that
shouldn't really affect anything anyway
and then the only other thing that I've
changed is I've set the render scale to
be fixed at 75 percent if we're getting
a good frame rate I might bump it back
up to 100% that will give us the best
visual detail at least ignoring
everything else but all that said let's
go ahead and jump into a game I pick
Zarya I usually go for Zarya or fara I'm
not sure why all right we're just in the
staging area right now but getting
pretty good frame rate actually in the
80s and above 90 so I'm going to
something real quick actually bumps that
render scale back up to hundred percent
and let's see how that does it so now
we're around 60 all right so maybe 75
might be a better option
this doesn't make things noticeably
sharper though I will will say that 64
66 right now
five that lived that long but okay the
fun thing about actually playing these
games as I test them is that I
completely forget that I'm testing a
game and then I'm actually playing the
game and kind of having fun more to the
point though let's take a look at some
stats RAM usage is a little bit over
five gigs so that's definitely on the
higher side but not too much of a
concern as again our framerate seems to
be holding it above 60fps even with the
render scale set to the max what am I
being attacked from oh she's like
standing behind me I was even paying
attention
plus I was saying RAM usage is a little
over five gigs and dedicated the RAM is
using almost the full amounts just under
one full gig for V Ram so it looks like
we're pretty solid there as well oh oh
did we get it got it we won I was
nowhere near there but we still won
that's what's important alright so that
was a lot of fun and I haven't played
overwatch in a few weeks so that's
always nice but I think at this point I
probably need to call things quits and
at least give a quick assessment good
this is a good little system for the
price and everything I'm getting
excellent performance and I'm able to
play these games granted not at highest
settings but we're using an integrated
graphics chip anyway so of course
there's going to be an upgrade path to
that we can always make this system
better if we want but with this memory
configuration and these settings
we're definitely kind of hitting the top
end of where we want to be when it comes
to like future proofing and being
capable of supporting higher end games
for example but it's definitely capable
of playing them and if you're a 1080
gamer and you want to get into PC gaming
it seems like a very very viable
solution alright guys that is gonna wrap
it up for this video I hope you've
enjoyed it and again my apologies for it
being quite delayed but if you happen to
build this system and get it all put
together and then let me know what your
experience was down in the comment
section down below is it working well
for you if graphics cards prices come
down then I will hopefully do an upgrade
pass on
system as well show what kind of
performance different so you can get by
installing a graphics card maybe go into
some overclocking if you upgrade the
cooling solution that's the great thing
about building a new system like this is
it opens this pathway to all the other
things that you might do with it besides
just playing video games like like I've
been doing a little bit with today but
before I make this video too long I want
to say thank you again for watching
thanks to all you guys who have been
tweeting to me and asking me where I've
been in that kind of thing I have heard
them and it makes me feel warm and fuzzy
inside on your way up if you can hit the
thumbs up button it's much much
appreciated and thank you for watching
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
