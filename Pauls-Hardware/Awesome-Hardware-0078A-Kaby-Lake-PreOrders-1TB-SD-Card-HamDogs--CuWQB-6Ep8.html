things are looking good oh sure make
sure that's needed that is needed
everything's needed hey sweet beautiful
I should I think we're live like I never
night can I okay uh well everybody let's
do it according to the thing we're
streaming live so let's just start the
show hi guys and welcome this is awesome
hardware the live show I do every week
with Kyle we stream live to twitch TV /
awesome hardware we also stream to each
of our YouTube channels right now we're
streaming part a or the first half of
episode number 78 it is September 20th
2016 and after we do my half for about
an hour so we're gonna switch over to
Kyle's half which will be on his channel
which is linked down in the description
below and it should be should be good
times twitter is still saying we're late
and there's nothing on the screen I like
a cheap drug but I am on the awesome
hardware it says rely chat it does save
you were zero just strange whatever
them all no its life grind did it freeze
maybe that would be I'll be crappy let
me check actually my my browser's frozen
so my laptop fortunately my goodness
what we're actually streaming with I'm
Jack right here yeah it says her stream
of the switch
yeah we're fine all right for streaming
for my people go we're not like we're
not live on twitch it must be twitches
fault oh yeah I don't know why did the
freaking that link it says twitch
awesome hardware I have no idea what you
can't tell cuz your browser's frozen it
says we're offline on my computer
alright well I'll cut this I'll restart
the twitch stream then just to make make
things yeah awesomes hardware awesome
hardware can you guys hear us is it just
the video yeah just not everything's
fine on on YouTube I think I think it's
just the twitch feed that's not working
properly right we'd my bigotry beat
which could be the weed all right so it
says we're live streaming to twitch now
too okay so that's good i'm gonna sneeze
sneeze yeah maybe get away that might
sneeze look that way nevermind it went
away it's gonna come back later when I
least expect it all went away yeah how
likely it will come back rest in peace
at some swing why why is my browser
actin all funky well anyway uh we're
live so I should like do the stuff that
we do at the beginning of the show he'll
show demo everyone and welcome it's
awesome hardware I've already said most
of the stuff that we say so let's move
on to selling stuff if you guys would
hope support us if you're not already
impressed like i'ma show is going like I
have that right there of a chat uh then
help us by shopping at our stores my
store is paul sartre brunette or stored
at pulse over at net net pint glasses
are back in stock gotten i forgot to
respond to john's mold of her website
but hey Frank glasses are back so if you
guys have been waiting to get the 20
ounce English pub glasses let's go say
wounds just came down stock so check
those out available as a single or set
of 2 also shirts and zip up hoodies
check out the zip up hoodie it's very
warm it's getting cold winters Cummings
getting cold all you people who don't
live where we live indeed uh that your
logo did you update to Luna well I did
but just a placeholder ok it was one of
the preset ones that Squarespace had ah
it looks it looks great you should use
that bit with tech / store is Kyle
Storer he also has a selection of shirts
in a
eighty of humorous designs yes and
everyone check those that they're all
great all right before we move on to the
show proper let's drink some beer how
about that bo bo bo what are we drinking
um so I have a green flash West Coast
IPA it's actually a double india pale
ale no that's like twice is just like
the best kind of beer ever yeah well
maybe we'll decide that later in the
show if a lily is or not but we might
the best kind maybe perhaps what are you
drinking I am drinking I don't know but
uh mother earth brewing company's syntax
which is an imperial stout nice get it
get hammered 8.1 percent mine's 8.1 to
buy cold and drink now oh so we're on
equal footing once I guess we have
to drink it now because the bottle
center which is weird considering that
we're playing are we doing face off
later yes usually we're not on equal
footing that was the joke oh sorry all
right yay for me whoo cheers Cheers show
solo show be and choose to all of you
drinking beverages at home whether they
be as own beverages or or water assuming
you're of age and doing it responsibly
of course yep all right doing it let's
start with uh-huh Navy no no no one how
many ever okay uh yeah so I have some
some hardware news to discuss here
that's assuming see what I was gonna try
to do here is actually have my half of
the show up here so I can actually talk
to youtube chat i keep yawning any more
beer I don't know it's like a twin drink
more figure well figure stuff out all
right it's bad I just I didn't drink a
lot before the show which is why is all
 up let's change somehow have to
figure out what's going on with that all
right so hot n heavy hardware we're
gonna start off with the hardware that
you can't buy yet but people are really
excited about buying when it's available
at some point okay be like yeah the i7
7700 although Anthony if you're watching
I think this is a typo in your headline
is cuz the headline says 7700 but the
article says 7700 k
hmm Anthony you should go fix it yep um
anyway basically it's gone up for sale
on a website from Estonia Estonia yes
it's being sold by an Estonian online
retailer the original story who is
actually from vr-zone com let's pull
that up really quick and see here it is
Oh pillars belt poo dub I don't know
what pill tapu dava means that an offer
code that's its if you translate core i7
7700 k into estonian it spilt food up
being sold here for 360 euros and 35
European sense is that a cent is that
what is it what is a fraction of a
Europe of a euro coins is it a cent euro
coins mini euros the balloons perhaps I
don't know anyway pence Pence's but yeah
there's not a whole lot honestly to say
other than that this was listed by this
retailer just means that hey these exist
and they are gonna go for sale this
could be an indication of a price 400
bucks us sounds like what they would
want to try to sell a 40 or a 7700 k 4
also seems like more expensive than they
could like remember when the like 2,600
k 3770k launch those were all on the 330
$350 range i feel like right did you say
3570k i'm talking about the equivalent
to this of it sick so this is a 7700 k
if we just stick with the top line
solutions yeah of course Evans on the on
the mainstream not enthusiasts then it's
6770 700k 6700 k before that would be 47
90 k before that was 4770k before that
was 3770k before that was 2600 k yep
there was also a 2700 k in there rad
that came out a little bit after the
2600 k how do i remember all that stuff
I forget so many things yet somehow I
remember I feel like those are the CPUs
we probably worked with most lower
that's high in flagship that's true core
i7 so yeah but I've got some exposure
but I do feel like Intel
asking price at launch for that flagship
quad core with hyper-threading a
mainstream chip has been climbing very
fairly steadily granted it hasn't
exploded in price quite as much as like
their thousand-dollar processor which is
now 17 hundred dollars obviously note 7
joke like I you sent that in / to eat it
there it says so it's totally
intentional exclusive technology so
what's what's with this turbo booze
feature there's new turbo turbo boost
that I'm seeing in your notes I don't
know I that was probably a bad copy
paste 4.5 gigahertz under Turbo Booster
boob yeah I didn't I thought have
highlighted the whole word pull forward
boost ah okay what Anthony was saying in
the articles is there a list some specs
including the tape threads at 4.2
gigahertz but we already know from Intel
that the turbo boost is going to be four
point five gigahertz so yeah um but
anyway these aren't going to be out till
january or februari probably q1 of next
year so that's said it's sad for fur
builds this holiday season people are
going to be building computers knowing
that this is right on the horizon yet
same goes for ambi though because
they're Zen processors are definitely
not going to be out this year indeed
even am for motherboard and for bass
motherboards we're still not totally
sure about but at least we have pictures
so we can look at the pictures and say
wow they look very similar picture of a
cpu socket this and in particular
spilled was leaked by i don't know where
this came from the articles OC 3d data
net but the sources wccftech of course
it is anyway so there's there's a name
for socket guys looking straight at one
looks very very similar to name three
socket but it is different for instance
if you were to count all those little
holes in it it has 1331 pins that's how
many pins these i can tell just from
looking as a picture this will also
confirm some people were like oh is AMD
gonna go LGA for this i don't think they
can i think until my haven't you I think
yeah I think Intel might have a patent
on LGA or something like that I'm not
positive about that I'm just speculating
just
be clear but still going to be PGA so
the pins are still going to be on the
cpu side the socket is roughly the same
size but they are fitting more pins in
there am 3 plus socket had 942 pins
that's a lot less pins which is weird
because it's only just a few more pins
and socket 939 and that was like back in
2005-2006 but anyway that is more than
forty percent more pins and then it's
also rumored of course to have support
for thirty two hundred megahertz dual
channel ddr for as well as up to 24 pci
express lanes depending on uh
motherboards chipset and as we have
discussed here in the show before
there's still many questions when it
comes to amd's n as far as what you're
going to get with the non zen cpus or AP
use that you can buy before zen launches
whether the motherboards you're going to
be able to buy before his n launches
will be compatible to center if you'll
need a special chipset present or
anything like that still all up in the
air but um hopefully there will be some
upgrade path for that kind of thing like
the flagships and only the flagship
sends cpus will actually have the full
24 PCIe lanes you know tamiha just kind
of like the Intel enthusiast platform
and whatnot yes I mean there's still
loads of specs that are still questions
not determined yet we don't know of
course at the however that they will
have pcie gen3 so that that is nice
because I've mainstream AMD CPUs with
pcie gen3 USB 3.1 sport for Jen to 3.1
10 gigabit per second as well as nvme
support so advances newer storage
technology support of course and then
they also have a new mounting hole
spacing and this is perhaps something to
pay attention to if you're considering
like an upgrade path because one thing
that AMD has done for well until has
actually been pretty good about it to
now for a while on their mainstream
socket is AMD's had the same mounting
mechanism for their CPUs for quite some
time however that is going to be
changing and it looks like at least
according to some of the early pictures
we've seen this is also from overclocked
3d this is a HP board and it's a square
board looks kind of it I'm not sure what
the form factor is here I'm not really
feel like a proprietary
yeah rebuilt most likely yes like what
Kyle said is going into a desired
specification HP system so they don't
have to worry about a motherboard
standard but you can see the mounting
holes for the socket are actually more
of a square pattern here similar to the
layout that we have seen with Intel so
you also don't have a big plastic
bracket on the board so it's nice who
knows I mean potentially they might even
have gone with the layout here that's
even compatible with existing Intel
layouts like head out I doubt it but who
knows they might want to be able to
advertise hey all of those CPU coolers
that you've used you know you don't need
a new one that's compatible with it but
that still remains to be seen yeah but
clearly they're going away from the old
design of melting the CPU and securing
the heatsink cool yay that's fun all
right that's the most exciting news in
the hot and heavy hardware this is kind
of fellow is kind of a slow news week
this week there's there are a few things
we have the Google pixel leaks and stuff
next up it's a power supply oh I know
why it's cuz it's because of the Apple
it was because of sample events they
stole everything they stole all the
press all just like no one else wants to
like an Audi products against the apple
stuff and we usually don't discuss the
apple stuff in too much detail here so
we should have had apple week or
something where we only talked about I
just talked about Apple we switch to one
of the viewers to max for the week
plummet to all-time lows hey power
supply offends you not fans of the
people who enjoy power supply EVGA has a
wide variety of power supplies they do a
pretty good job with them we've used
them reckon recommended that many times
the new EVGA g2 l series they've added
an l2 that means light because there are
now leds leds stands for light emitting
diode so look these plugs on the EVGA
power supplies work bored stands for lit
or already lit built-in LED illumination
I thought these were going to be RGB at
first but it looks like they're just
white I was hearing different things
actually like from people in comments
and like I don't know if it was
article but at one point I read today
like RGB it was like I thought they were
just white too so I guess they are I I
thought they were RGB but these look
just white I know these are actually
these connectors i have seen used
actually originally saw used in a rose
well lightning Pacquiao's i say a long
time ago so the EVGA this has been done
before but you know not with EVGA power
supplies yeah and can you turn the
lights off I don't go though I really
not sure how that amazed it's a better
fit software um I controlled it i would
say i doubt it because usually for
something like that you would need a
switch or some physical thing unless
there's a switch on the opposite side
wait they have pictures oh yeah that's
probably just take your switch pictures
a man nope cabling I'm cabling looks you
know fine it's all black so let's leave
no I'm pictures that black shite oh yeah
le anh Li Jian off switch Anna Nico oh
yeah and you can be like ooh do you hate
the planet or do you love the planet
hate it today apparently EVGA ships it
in a default I hate the planet mode
they're scumbags bastards so I that's
why we never hang out with Jacob he's
always littering everywhere and spitting
on baby seals that's not true man city
since its lenders whipping them with
power supply cables that's his hobby all
right uh here's here's a motherboard I
saw as I saw somebody tweet about this
and I forget who was uh me was it Brian
shoot who tweeted about this I don't
know ffree I'm sorry but um anyway this
is an asrock motherboard i don't think
it's available yet but it should be
available soon because there's pictures
of it and everything hyper affordable
this is a hyper affordable motherboard
that's enough I thought it was
interesting because it I mean that it's
very let me it's very cheap at 60 bucks
so if you wanted to get on the
you know that on the Intel train was
with the skylake processors and you
don't want to do an overclockable one so
something like a 60 100 can I 316 100 in
something like this you can get up and
running for very very inexpensive it's
pretty cool price like that I wish they
did more pic micro ATX looks like looks
I just look at the image zoom in on the
image look at that or no is it mini ITX
it's like a and this is like I to I like
to call this form factor slim micro ATX
that's made up I made that up but it is
the it is the height from top to bottom
of micro ATX but it is not the width so
it's not quite as wide it only goes okay
it's this is only slightly wider than a
standard mini ITX motherboard I see but
um up to 32 gigs of memory that's
assuming you go 16 gig dim since there's
only two dimm slots pci express 3.0 x16
slot for your graphics card single
expansion slot although it is pcie gen
to bear that in mind but hey you can
drop a single looks I mean gentoo for
your basic simple expansion cards like a
sound card or something like that that's
like that won't make much of a
difference anyway yeah four SATA 6
gigabit per second ports for USB 3.4
although they are counting in those four
USB 3 2 weeks here at the front as well
as two via the front panel header but
that's even though they have an internal
header for USB 3 yeah usually most
boards at that price point don't really
they just don't even have one on they
just won't have one huh yeah a lot of
them Dukes maybe some there are some out
there but it's kind of nice that they
have that there yeah so gigabit ethernet
via a realtek chip for plus one phase
power delivery and from visually looking
at it here I don't know how to throw a
look at it yeah I mean a pretty simple
color scheme looks decent you know it's
even got some cooling active cooling or
not active cooling but some passive
cooling on the VRMs I noticed very very
slim on the i/o here I mean you got you
got a ps2 ports for my mouse and
keyboard yeah a single DVI out no other
know like that they're saving costs here
no hdmi then or not to pay an HDMI list
licensing fee for that single DVI up out
but if you add a graphics card you can
get around that
and pretty limited for as far as us BTW
still has an audio jack phone it does
still have an audio jack so it does have
that over the iphone 7 so I'm it's 60
bucks sixty bucks so if you guys are
building a super budget system I don't
know I might I might I'm excited tossing
this board into it yeah that looks
pretty cute bill there's something like
this it already outers it uh just
announced I think it's just been
announced okay September seventh no way
this is yeah expect a sub sixty dollar
price that's like something i'd use for
that's what i should have used for wifey
sauces build oh yeah she like hardly
ever uses it for gaming or anything so
she has a way more she has an Opie
system for what she really uses it for
something like that would be nice
dropping a core i3 so you're saying
you're not gonna build your wife a
water-cooled system I mean you could
only only only idiots would do that Paul
what are you talking about and if my
wife kind of stupid has been playing
lots of video games on her water-cooled
system oh yeah well if ya if she's
playing video game that's fine you know
otherwise i fended vigorous things dumb
okay that's all for hot and heavy
hardware let's write on two tales from
space tails it's just a slightly shorter
episode of Tales from space this week
because our mood in the tales from space
segment has been somewhat dampened
because SpaceX we get excited about
space X but they've had can have some
rough times just recently I'm do of
course and mainly to the September first
Falcon 9 rocket explosion that happens
that that rocket we talked about that
here on the show a correction in case
any of you guys been waiting for what we
talked about that being a facebook
satellite going to add provide internet
to Africa that was completely false it's
actually an Israeli telecommunication
satellite but I don't know how this I
don't know how those facebook satellite
rumors started no but they seem to gain
some traction with
so in the aftermath of that explosion of
September first SpaceX for their part
has been trying to figure out what the
hell happens they still do not exactly
know it seems to be very much a mystery
to them they've been like reaching out
on Twitter and stuff for people to send
pictures of it and everything to give
them more information but according to
this specific article the score as of
now because every time you have a failed
launch your score resets to zero is Uli
United Launch Alliance 111 Arian 73f
time pronounced in the area arianny a
dyani it's that's the EU that's an EU
this is Airbus Italian it's Europe oh ok
which Italy is part of everyone's butt
area everyone 73 SpaceX down to zero
because of their most recent failed
lunch anyway lots of text in this
article let's let's get rid of that so
SpaceX is less than 15 year old years
old now since it was founded by elon
musk's a teenager originally after he
left paypal they offer rocket rides up
into orbit for 62 million dollars which
is very very very cheap compared to how
much independent companies or private
companies would have to pay for to get
something up into space beforehand
sounds cheese basics has had a lot of
success in this realm by making private
but first off by being a privately
funded company and second off by cutting
costs in a lot of different areas in
order to get rockets into space for a
lot cheaper however seems to come at a
cost and right now they're doing with a
backlash of a lot of that that being
well rockets exploding and that not
being a good thing for them so up until
jun 2015 they actually had 20 straight
successful launches and that was when
the CRS 7 mission exploded in mid fight
flight which we also talked about last
year on the show SpaceX quickly regained
its footing however returning to flight
december of last year and sticking its
first landing on earth in the process I
mean they had nine more successful
launches before the September first
explosion SpaceX as I've already
mentioned have been tweeting trying to
find you know any additional evidence as
to figure out why
this explosion actually happens I I have
no evidence to prove that it was a
conspiracy theory by United Launch
Alliance and arianne sabotaging it
that's I have no basis for even saying
that at all hmm anyway in the meantime
United Launch Alliance which is a
combined effort between Boeing Lockheed
has had a successful launch just
recently the osiris-rex mission or I
don't know to college it's like a probe
osiris-rex is it's against going to an
asteroid and it's actually going to go
and get bits of the asteroid and bring
it back to earth it's going to take
quite a few years I forget what year it
actually returns back i think it's like
20 20 or something like that but you
know getting stuff from an asteroid
bringing back that's kind of cool that
was United Launch alliances 111 straight
successful launch aboard of course one
of the Atlas 5 rockets since united
launch alliance was formed in december
two thousand six it has yet to suffer a
single mishap on any of its big rockets
so whereas we have sort of poked fun at
them as not being quite as up to speed
with SpaceX when it comes to efficiency
and that kind of thing at the same time
maybe this bureaucratic overhead or
whatever the heck they do and spend all
their money on at ula has at least led
to safety in launches and they are
touting that right now as a reason to do
business with them you try to figure out
what the hell's going on a chat yes
someone just said they're talking about
the note 7 catching on fire probably
because you're talking about the
exploding rockets and someone's like
note H should be better then someone
said notes them somebody just said like
eight is a bad number or like I gave on
the note i gave up on the number eight
after windows 8 its lucky and now
there's just nothing but eighths inch at
like like miles chad is a fickle a
fickle creature it is youtube it is it
is youtube so there's special who know
their special who knows what the hell is
going you guys are special out there on
the youtubes i love you you keep being
you anyway so moving on here moving on
here cuz the segment is boring ula so
much text uoa has had a lot of
successful launches in a row
11 arion arianne has to now had 74 they
actually had 74 straight successes with
our previous launch vehicle area in for
which they retired in 2003 and then
arion 5 has now flown without a single
incident since its inauguration in 2003
so all this is to say that ula at least
sorry to stop distractors an eight war
now twitch is doing it and then it
kick-started YouTube doing it again
another competing who can do the most 8
this is madness look obvious partying
because everyone is so fascinated with
myspace information clear clearly ones
and gay right United Launch Alliance is
now announced rapid lunch so basically
they're allowing you to order a launch
and get your into space in three
months they're doing this partially
because they do not have enough military
contracts to fill out their launch
schedule they have availability on the
Atlas 5 manifest in 2017 says Kent legs
ow ula is vice president of business
development so basically this will allow
you to get the fastest like if you're
like something like holy crap I need to
get this I need to get this into space
like Amazon Prime like Amazon pretty
exactly it's like two day shipping up
there all right let's do this just just
throw it on there three months may
put it up there for you three months
Sharia allows customers to launch in as
few as three months from placing their
order you also get to watch like free
free movieson on space prime if you
subscribe how nice for the three-month
shipping you also get their hole that is
good inventory of streaming services no
else is really good as this ball space
I'm x-ray shows do you like it yeah I
had it like a week or two ago I was
supposed to give it to you for kind of
sploosh two weeks ago I'm awesome
hardware yourself today ended up
drinking it it's like ball I'm
drinking this is for me what are the
flavors in here I'm tasting it up
America ha save it further and ordered
by brown sugar and peanut butter essence
you're just gonna use that later
oh yes oh don't know what we're you guys
will know what I'm talking about yeah
well you'll know right now cuz that
one's next huh Oh swordfighter ratings
what next it is time for surgery well
normally we'd have a sponsor's trial but
we actually yes video is brought to you
by s today yay is it always brought to
us brought to us by us brought to them
by us yeah but but now it's only it were
just that winning exclusive sponsor
exclusive our show for today's show all
right let's move on to sword fight yay
for sword fight mm-hmm this is where can
i pick up a controversial topics and we
argue about them again kind of a slow
news week and we didn't want to argue
about apple stuff so I reached out on
Twitter and I actually got a suggestion
biotech ninja yota underscored in john's
order top a very simple question a
question that we have not asked before
here on the show with but you'd think we
would have argued at one point what's
the best type of beer oh that's easy
clearly there's bud light that's it's a
short list here as far as the options go
you know I should be doing jeez you have
a lot of options there I guess there's a
lot of beer should be linking this in
chat I'll to get 2 i'll handle the
youtubes ok i guess which such teamwork
here's your straw poll guys so together
I'm go to that but there's so many
different types of you actually so and
Cal and I while we drink lots of beer I
don't think I I wouldn't call myself an
expert by any stretch of the imagination
I'm an expert drinker how's an expert
expert beer reviewer I referred to this
image here which is also linked in the
description if you guys want to check it
out in order to actually show all the
different varieties of beer that are
available around the world Oh world of
beers so based on this I have only given
options for this first set of circles
here and that is why the list is better
or worse depending on your perspective I
went for the first round not these sub
varieties like you know American lager
malt liquor like obviously I'd be all
over the malt liquor for the ice beer
for sure no liquor back mickey's instead
we've kept it more simple pale ale
Porter stouts lamba Gail brown ale
American lager German
your European lager pilsner Irish ale
german and belgian ale okay I'm all
those options here we're gonna decide
this once and throw I'll let you go
first since you'll be wrong okay since
it's there and since it has been one of
my favorites lately I'm gonna go with
brown ale brown brown ale sorry I got
something in my is the best type of beer
everyone should only drink brown ale be
why why should you go for brown ale if
you're gonna drink some beer I will tell
you why first off you're gonna have
everyone who's really like they're all
about the bidders and they're all about
the hops you know the people are on the
into the IPAs and stuff like that let me
tell you something about that I can
understand that to some degree you kind
of get into it but what you know what it
does is it it taints your palate it's
like putting a taint right on your
palate that's not how the word is in
defying what just continue all right so
and then and then you get to to attune
to those two really really a hoppy case
and everything and then you actually
can't appreciate the broader range of
beers it's like you're taking this whole
world of beers as represented by that
picture we just showed and you've
narrowed it down to something so
simplistic that you know you can't
appreciate the other varieties about
their brown ale it's not too heavy it's
not too late it's right in the middle
it's not like a port or something like
that it's not like a straight-up ale or
you know like it like a German ale or
something like that it's got enough
weight to it to be substantial it's got
a little bit more sweetness to it and
you know i'm just i'm kind of a sweet
guy so can I kind of lean that that way
a little bit and it's got the flavors in
it that you would associate with beer
you know there's certain beers that are
appropriate in certain situations you
know like if you're sitting on a beach
in Mexico you want to drink like a
pacifico if you're a not a savage or
corona if you're a hateful person
there's other types of beers that are
you know the beers that are situational
in this situation I will drink this beer
abroad I'll you can have it whenever you
know like what that's anyway that that
was the worst argument you're right
that's ever made a terrible argument
you're on his hardware because I'm just
a point if you wanna if you want a
better argument go to beer advocate and
you'll hear people use words to describe
beer that is really yeah yeah I wouldn't
want to go up against like well Wheaton
this topic no he knows a lot about beer
he does he had a beer named after the
boot stoked oh yeah even though that's
not really named after him but he helps
it helps collaborate with stone I think
there's a wheat there's a something
wheat well will the wheat wheat no it's
like will wit beers no you're right yeah
yes I'm like that anyway um here's why
you're wrong Paul basically your whole
argument was like well you know you can
drink brownell anytime and other beers
you can and like other beers like taste
so strongly that you can't enjoy that on
a beach that was your argument now let
me just tell you right now I've enjoyed
pretty much what it boils down to i have
enjoyed a classic IPA once or twice a
week why are you voting for you IPA okay
when we go the IPA round because i'm
drinking one right here right in front
of me's to be clear i pee is not an
option so callous Bloods for pale ale no
that is not what i can go for IP I cuz i
pay and pay little or slightly different
even though okay yes bring you to the
chart here's your chart cannot be used
as the part of your argument i had world
of beer it's on at shirt i can I guess
hail hail and then there's I PA pale ale
is this lighter color orange indicating
the like the genus and then this is like
the species yeah but you can't you can't
just like here's what you're drinking
today the double IPA yeah which is right
over there that's still a circle see I'm
arguing for one of the circles any of
those circles are two lines though
between that I'm just trying to just
there's a hierarchy here that's all I'm
trying okay new rule some of the some of
the reasons and some of the the benefits
of ipas still apply to pale ales um for
example pale ales are they have an
aromatic essence like you never like
stick your nose into a glass of brown
ale and just like smell it before you
drink it like a glass of wine you would
really aah that's definitely malt you
don't do that with beer I do with IPAs
drink the beer no I pas are different
because IPAs have that certain that
certain perfect blend of hops unit gives
you a beautiful just both beautiful
floral you
Laurel Milton people who your day with
wine for being snooty and also I didn't
so I didn't so that wine drivers is
implied how clearly implied there you do
have to rewind and watch playback what's
that no you were no I'm saying like you
can't do that with a brown ale you can't
do what wine drinkers do with a brown
ale or at least no one ever does that no
one ever like takes a glass of brown ale
and like smells it like a wine drinker
would like appreciates the scent because
they're not sophistic there's no
aromatic profile that's worth sniffing
with the brown ale like there is with an
IPA for example and you get the floral
taste not only the scent but the you
know it obviously goes hand in hand with
the taste the flavor is very often very
piney or grassy you might say and it's
it's an incredibly refreshing on a hot
summery day an IPA can be extremely
refreshing I I typically enjoy the
bitterness I think the bitterness is an
acquired taste for sure but once you can
get over that hump you're not a complete
 it really can be a rewarding thing
to drink a beautiful a beautiful liquid
that that should be consumed by everyone
after of legal drinking responsible age
short sweet to the point and correct
that's all right and we always have to
point out as long as you're of a
responsible yes or no illegal I think
that in the age yeah yeah that's very
cuz yeah we're covering all the bases
it's legal it's all legal all right
we've argued this enough and there is
all the options and let's just see what
the real all right see what the results
are german lager my god it's like tide
stoutland longer what Pale Ale is
thirteen percent I beat you longer I had
German lagers pretty damn good yeah like
that were fresh stuff she's a baktun
that's why I was I was really on the
fence about even bringing this up cuz I
was like yeah that's pretty good yeah
that's protectors yeah like lots of
beers weird weird un dos it Porter Wow
Porter's no I don't bottom lambic I was
expecting lambic to be down there cuz
it's just not as is common like yeah see
that as much pills there yeah Europeans
about you screw you your pupil I
Rochelle really was expecting a little
bit more
for that there is lots of options here
so all right german lager wins kellett I
both lose yep although you did I guess
technically you beat me I got Top three
baby I got the bronze I took home the
Bronx browning over it down there you
took home the brown anyway I'm curious
as this video is up and not just the
live audience is involved but also the
audience who can't view live because you
guys can still go and vote that it's all
linked in the description then you can
vote on it and stuff stop flailing your
arms as dangerous okay president we have
one more certified question to talk
about this one I think is really this if
the beer question divided the audience
Burge this one this sorry I'm sorry to
link the verge you get a gun to my
friends food website he's a this this
someone has patented this this this
thing right here it is a a hot dog
hamburger hybrid mark Murray is the
inventor mark Murray articles a little
weird because it says he was granted a
US patent in 2009 but it also says he
pitched his idea to shark tank australia
in 2015 and then he didn't have the
patent so i don't know if the patent was
in youth in 2009 I maybe he applied for
in 2009 but he does have a patent on it
now you can actually get a hand dog
franchise which is I mean if you guys
can't tell you it's all it's all laid
out right here's the different figures
of the design for the ham dog you can
actually start a ham dog franchise for
ten thousand dollars you get the ham dog
marquee and you can become a reseller of
the hand dog this exists yeah and as as
you can see well this is like on that
scale the shark tank there was a shark
tank on this it's Shark Tank Australia
so it's not real shark tank actually I
would think it was be much more
dangerous in Australia sharks Australian
sharks giant spiders can scan up oh yeah
that's really got the hamburger and the
hot dog in the same very suggestive
thing and the question here obviously it
should this exists and I'm gonna link
I'm gonna link
no i'll link this and try to give this
some thought there's there's your strap
hole I got it I got YouTube Kyle's got
you 20 so should this exists should this
hand dog exist we have yes and it will
be all ever eat from now on yes but only
for special occasions weddings bar
mitzvahs no they should all be destroyed
or no we hit peak food with the
turducken I couldn't think of any other
clever responses for that so yeah
basically you got a yes or a no option
okay what do you think your cap um I am
gonna say I'm gonna say no and my answer
is pretty simple I mean I haven't really
done too much research on this topic but
I I think a hot dog is already amazing
and a hamburger is already amazing
combining the two it's like two
different types of meats but not really
done in the right way like there's not
enough other condiments that are going
to bind those two types of meats to make
them mesh really well together I mean
they mesh well physically there's
literally a hot dog in the middle of
 hamburger patty that's genius
but on a flavor level I don't think
there's enough chemistry to actually
make the hot dog meat and the hamburger
meat taste well together unless you're
just like a huge meat horn dog or
something I don't know this play on
words but I also think that if you have
something that you can do or make you
should just you should not half ass the
thing you should look at it you should
it's like a specialty thing like you're
not gonna like you specialize in hot
dogs and you make a really you make one
hot dog as good as you possibly can and
you make one hamburger as good as you
possibly can and it should just be able
to exist on its own without needing
anything else if you do it right but I
feel like if you just combine the two it
I don't know it doesn't mesh well to me
I think it's also awkward it looks weird
and it's not a it's not appetizing to
look at which is a part of the dining
experience I will say I mean nothing
turns me on more than a fat juicy
hamburger staring me in the face or a
hot dog just happy to see me um so
yeah I I think it's a bad call okay I'm
I'm just amazed at how how divided chad
is right now but its entire the the
proceedings going on you all right so
I'm with fire I Iowa obviously have to
vote for yes and I have the options of
yes only occasionally or yes all the
time I may say yes it'll be all I eat
from now on only because I have to argue
this and obviously I don't have access
to the ham dog right now so I can't I
can't back this up with my actual
dietary habits from now at this point
I'm onward but I will give a strong
argument for it nonetheless which is
basically like it's all about efficiency
and especially in America and especially
when it comes to eating like eating is a
pain in the ass like right it's like you
get hungry like I have to eat
there's I have to get food like I eat it
in there and I'm not pissed off anymore
i can go back and i can keep working or
doing whatever the hell I was doing like
beating is annoying right so what you
want to do is you want to eat you want
eat it quickly and as efficiently as
possible and what the ham dog allows you
to do is get your entire daily allotted
value of both meats as well as hot dog
bun in a single efficient meal and you
eat it all together and if you want
vegetables or whatever that's what you
put the condiments on there for you put
the condiments on that gives you
vegetables and that's where you get your
health food new units that's healthiness
and then you can just eat those
basically I wouldn't I wouldn't now I
don't want to go crazy here I wouldn't
recommend these for breakfast it's not a
breakfast food but lunch and dinner
every day hand dog you'd be you'd be the
picture of health I think and you
wouldn't have to think about you
wouldn't have that's ism this is the key
thing I mean granted you'd be like well
I want to eat the same thing every day
you won't have to think about it you
just bake all I'm hungry hand up he
didn't then you're good and I don't
think that's the best option the bun the
bun weirds me out like what he talking
but look at this cross-section they have
here I know it's weird I don't know this
is the dome I like the side view here
this is a side view this is the hot the
hamburger buns go to the spinner hat
Diana and sticking on it this is the
this is a front of you like if you were
looking at a dick straight on it would
look almost exactly the same as this
well we're like squashed balls the balls
balls a gift to dick this be if the dick
was set on a table so that the ball
pressing on the table for setting I they
sell a just relax Nexus what that would
be knocking balls anyway let's let's
move on results they should all be
destroyed ah clean tape coming in a
close second yes and it will be all I
eat from now on back bombing peak food
with the turducken the turducken is a
thing of beauty is my family appetizing
alright let's let's move on to the final
segments of my half of the show which is
news technews tech news here it is
alright so let's start with the gopro go
pro has they made some big announced
announcements was this today or
yesterday this is yesterday uh you guys
into gopro stuff what no sorry you shut
hi Joker shut your mouth no joke with
you Joker's here what's up Joker oh I
also wanted to say a shout out to a cell
for yes self remodeling is done in chat
as well as leiter Mike's there's by tur-
YouTube thanks for being a fan spider
spider Mike okay uh yeah so what was I
talking about the GoPro Hero 5 session
five and karma drone have all been
announced garbage room and X there you
go there's dude on stage really yeah you
oughta go pro brah are these all related
are they all by GoPro yes there are made
by GoPro okay remember heard of the RM
there's the hero five black which is the
first flagship action camera since the
hero4 was announced back in 2014 make
sense that is it relevant way right
there 5 is after four yes that is true
oh hey when i zoom and it doesn't do him
it just makes things almost the same
size but kinda it's kind of got a
reskinned look to it that's the hero
fighters Matt aesthetic yeah there's
also the hero five session session jar
the ones on the sides here's here's the
session the cap tiny it is almost
basically like a little kid it's like a
lens and where is everything
so it's even tinier than a regular go
press is very tiny hmm that is the
session so what is the difference other
than it just being smaller well thank
you for asking that cow leather shoes
right here um both are compatible to
karma drone and let's show you let's
show you the car oh so you can just
mount it to the drone yeah there's
there's no I don't know man DJ I make
some good drones bro don't have to throw
it's all about to go prod oh I had some
pretty good cameras on to my DJI phantom
4 yo is waiting can they fold up hold on
him I needed to fold up I'm trying to
get this drone video to actually show me
a picture of the Damned room I mean how
much I mean it folds up look just hold
up and fits in this little case that is
not like that no one cares that's kind
of fun nope yeah all right so yeah both
are compatible to drum the hero five
black is 400 bucks 399 here 5 session
this little guy is 299 or three hugs
less resolution perhaps getting to that
both of them both of them can shoot 4k
30 frames per second video um they can
also both do 1080 60 video if you know
if you prefer the frame rate over the
resolution so slow mo is the difference
yes they are both water-resistant out of
the box as well up to 33 feet without a
housing that's not really cool as nice
as in like this right here is the water
good real you don't need the damn
plastic shell to go around yeah I was
cumbersome this is the hero five black
it is more it is like a more rugged hero
for as is described it does shoot higher
resolution photos 12 megapixel versus
the session which is 10 megapixel it
hasn't that 2 inch lcds Ted this is
actually a touchscreen wait where's on
the front on the back on the bed oh you
inch LCD touch screen on the back which
is actually really cool because touch
screen means like with firmware updates
and whatever they adding new
functionality or buttons to push or
whatever they also both have a voice
activation which is pretty cool built-in
GPS they can capture raw photos I'm
sorry the five black can capture raw
photos and wide dynamic range and has a
built-in
yes the session can do 10 megapixel
photos does not have the ability to
capture Ross or do wide dynamic range
video okay um yeah anyway these are
designed with a simpler interface menu
one-button operation stereo mics they
have electronic image stabilization
which is actually listed as a con new to
the fact that Sony's newest action
cameras have a mechanical or optical
digital optical image stabilization yeah
this is this is using digital or digital
image stabilization which isn't as good
yeah and then there's the Karma drone
which is right here do they have a
picture of the controller of the drone
yeah the drone controller let's see yes
it's right here here's the Karma drone
almost looks like an Nvidia shield at
first it kind of does it's our big and
bulky karma drone hop out screen it
costs eight hundred dollars or 799 or
you can get it along with a hero five
for a thousand ninety nine or you can
get it with a hero five four thousand
dollars I don't know I don't like how
short the joysticks are which is
basically a hundred bucks off the price
of what you would buy just the hero five
or the session by itself um yeah the
controller is clamshell as you can see
here one half of it is a touchscreen
display up on top and then it's got two
joysticks on the bottom and there's not
a whole lot I mean they have a demo
video that they're shown up here of
controlling it and stuff and moving it
around but you know this there's not a
lot of these out in the wild yet it's
just what GoPro has revealed so far so
there's not too many more details about
that on the front of the drone though
there is a 3-axis gimbal for the camera
it is positioned towards the front of
the drone not underneath the drone and
that is to eliminate the appearance of
rotors potentially and and i think
that's that's all yeah that's all
alright go pro fun stuff
you want one I want to phantom for those
things up did you I have I us did you
see ash Taylor's video on it no my god
it's oh god go watch ash Taylor's
everybody oh go watch all of his videos
but especially the one on the DJI
phantom 4 oh we really want people to
watch ashes videos they'd realized that
kiss videos are way better than ours may
be like what book you guys doing punk ow
why don't you get your dash does how
come your videos aren't inspirational
and yeah that might have storylines and
plots and character development make me
feel like I'm alive oh that's tough damn
it ash no keep doing what you're doing
it yes GG man um but yeah that drone is
legit like all the tracking features it
has how much is it it's I think 1,100
maybe 1,200 so a bit more expensive than
this but like a lot of the safety
features like you can just run it like I
give it to a 12 year old 12 year olds
not gonna crash it because the drone
will just stop itself it's got like two
cameras underneath in front of its it'll
just like stopped before hits a wall or
a tree or anything like that it's got
the return to home button it's also
really good on tracking you can just I
can drive a car and just have the drone
all right go after it and then like the
camera will always be on the car the car
will always be centered in the frame so
it's like Josh proof it makes a lot of a
two-man operations cuz you know in film
when they do drone movements usually
they have one guy they have two
controllers for one drone so one guys
just piloting it and the other guys just
doing camera work but the Phantom 4 has
such good tracking for the camera that
now you only need one person to do like
a to what was originally a two-man job
which is pretty insane that's cool hey
sorry um guys I am not seeing donation
likes you they mine right donations are
coming up none of them have popped up
that I have not seen a single donation
is usually it's really apparent really
its in green text no I'm just seeing
chat people saying donations read
donation links and I am sorry guys I do
not know what the hell is going on right
now yeah I see I see none of them right
there's no green anywhere nothing much
must be YouTube I really
i really wish youtube had some option to
filter that out so i am really good I'm
really I'm really sorry about that guys
uh yeah I looks I don't know what to do
but thank you that was saying whoever
has been donating or who has donated
during the stream we really do
appreciate it I'm sorry that we can't
read out your comments that you attached
to that donation like we usually do Matt
Matt Kylie silly what did good one at
the side of the show Matt thank you I'm
sorry if it didn't actually appear or
anything like that I'm using chrome if
it doesn't work in chrome i'm using i'm
using edge so I'm cows using it just for
twitch chat everything else is on Chrome
go crucify me yeah i use i usually use a
chrome and firefox both I kind of used
both for different things so yeah sorry
again guys about the potential lack of
donation income and show but it is very
much appreciated and warning no one else
donate unless you yeah care about your
comment being read right all right Gears
of War for an exciting new game that
Kyle has more information about on his
side of the show during the games report
it's better uh years of war for will be
free with nvidia gtx 1070 and 1080 GPUs
for a limited time it's kind of cool I
like free games with graphics cards hell
yeah I think it is a great way to give
some added value to especially if you're
buying you know dropping three four five
five hundred bucks on a GPU um getting a
specially like a triple a title that
you're like I would have spent fifty
bucks on that anyway I think it's a
great option so this is only for a
limited time so bear that in mind never
settle back to my damned forever notes
between September 20th so it started
today and October thirtieth so you only
have a little over a month to do this
but if you happen to buy at 1070 or a
1080 GPU in that time frame this is
worldwide except for Japan sorry
Japanese people you're screwed no I
don't know why Japan is excluded but
it's everywhere except japan probably
desert it's also limited quantities
which seems weird since its video game
which is a digital title how was that
limited no
it's probably just too yeah like its
marketing yeah its marketing stuff it's
so they can cut it off if they're really
hemorrhaging yeah money or something
like that which I doubt will be the case
also this applies to both desktop and
laptops so not just getting a desktop
graphics card dropping your desktop but
also since 10 60s and 70s in 10 eighties
can now be integrated into laptops you
bet a nap top you also get the game oh
that's gold school that's nice yeah I
like that so that's nice guys up for
that and more i gives you know for when
we get over to kyles after this
word uh look at this oh I didn't realize
I still have this up a little time say
look at this the Sam Sam disk SD card
it's a friggin terabyte look how big it
is I also assume it's like five times
are working memory what what the
that's the first one I write DV ciao
thank you for your five donation and
yeah we leave booty every night every
fret we just not look to chat that long
no I scroll all the way back up there's
nothing like it's not sure YouTube is
 with us I got no idea what's
going on with the YouTube in the
donations and stuff do you eat booty
Paul yes yes I already already answered
that you're not paying attention to me I
just want to hear you say it again okay
well for good measure it's it's recorded
so and you have pretty eyes everyone can
play back is it oh just just to add that
level 5 creepiness I'm so flattered yeah
alright so basically sandisk made a one
terabyte SD card to prove to the world
that you can continually be like wow
look how much starters in this tiny
little thing glass which just keeps dick
measure can still do that now they say
they're making this for accommodations
for videographers and that kind of thing
for k 6 k-8 k video yeah you need lots
of storage space for that kind of thing
360 video as well vr content they have
not released any pricing on this
probably was my biggest question range
for 3 how much does this freaking thing
cost probably 400 400 is what we're
guessing so i did a this isn't going to
show anything no that's not right with
us i did i did just a google search for
5 and 12 gig card it looks like the 512
cards are between 200 and 300 dollars
right now
unless you must read the latest donation
unless he oh no way really that's
 awesome that is awesome thank
you very much Matt for the donation the
early Matt started his first earn his
job at newegg today and apparently Paul
and I were in the training video really
so um danette I'm hitting up newegg
where I can any residual gender newegg
for a little bit of royalties on that
really using our image no you're gonna
do a horrible job at newegg if you were
watching us in training videos just what
do the opposite of what we did now we
actually did a good job follow us kind
of wonder where he started I would guess
customer service but video team as a
whole that may be a team today do they
make the video team make a video on how
to be on the video team cuz that would
be appropriate but then who made the
video if they didn't have the video team
to begin but um alright well that's
that's cool i like i like high capacity
what SD cards are you rocking paul what
capacity what i have 3 64 gig cards that
i use in my three cameras 64 gig if you
have to you 256gb ones rate i do and i'm
still waiting for the day where i
actually use them up yeah i have like
gone like weeks without not formatting
and just shot like video after video
like it doesn't fill up and i'm shooting
1080 granted still but even for k I feel
like it's good I might yeah I'm probably
gonna start to feel the burn a little
bit more as i switched to 4k full time
cuz i'm trying to do that and yeah yeah
right not to do that now i guess i have
to do 4k now thanks man you should geez
lemon let's start here now google pixel
phones i'm actually looked vaguely I'm
vaguely excited for this I don't and
like I can if I kind of keep a a sort of
loose this is not too great I can't
phrase things right III don't follow the
cell phone market you know the
smartphone thing that's constantly new
phones and everything I don't fall out
that closely
but I do kind of keep an eye on it here
and there yeah it's always I like Nexus
phones though I use a head of Nexus 6
for a while I really enjoyed it and the
phones that get just just straight-up
Android and they get all the Android
updates and there's no skins on them or
any nonsense like that going on my wife
has a nexus 5x though and she's actually
had some problems recently mmm so it's
not a completely Rosie story where that
comes from but given that i will be
getting a new phone in the next few
months this could be an option for me
anyway this is the pixel it's going to
be an actual google phone it's made by
HTC and these are some leaked photos of
it or purportedly leaked photos of it
these are from android police and these
could be totally false so everyone can
see an iphone but yes and that is what
all the thing it sound like an iphone
like oh my god it just looks exactly
like an iphone actions it's like did
they just copy an iPhone or whatever
yeah to be fair I mean how much real
design work can you do with something
that's that's that size and shape yeah
you can do some stuff I guess but HTC
since HTC is designing these has used a
similar design for previous models
according to engadget at least we are
able to see that it has a fingerprint
sensor in the middle of the shiny or
glass-like section is why is the
fingerprint thing bored I don't know
they're blurring out like imei numbers
they're blowing out stuff but on the
front of it might make it identifiable I
don't know I don't know why because it's
just an iphone they don't maybe my
opponent is it just pictures of an
iphone i oh my god or a pixel or
whatever but um oh wait what are you
sure that's like what's the caption for
that photo are they saying that's just
like an iphone that is the image credit
from anonymous anonymous alligator on
android police but does it say this is
an iphone or it is to say this is the
pixel in the photo of the phones back
side you can see a fingerprint sensor
you can also see a snapshot of the
phone's screen you if they're thick
bezels below so close yes is very
similar but what about that black thing
right the black thing is a above the the
speaker
it's a boat on the iphone you're right
since pub do you yeah totally different
yep new design innovative sweet okay so
what else do we need to know about this
phone other than it looks like that's
all that's all I have to tell for this
that's really is really light on actual
information it's supposed to launch in
the next month or two though pre pre
holiday season so that's cool and yeah
I'll keep an eye out for it I'll
probably follow rumors on this one a
little bit more closely because I mean
it's it's just very the confluence of
things right now it's like HTC I like
HTC phones my wife had an HTC One for
quite a while was I really it wasn't a
phone that I used but I used hers like
from time to time and I really liked it
just I think HTC it has a good job like
Nexus phones it's launching at a time
when it which is right when I need new
phones anyway though that's all for my
