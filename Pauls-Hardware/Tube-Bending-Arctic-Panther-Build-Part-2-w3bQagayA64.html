visit monoprice comm hello everyone and
welcome to part 2 of the arctic panther
build anyway uh Jay and I are with
travels we have traveled Jay and I are
travel with horse and buggy with horse
and buggy because we're gonna get a few
extra components so we're taking you on
a bit of a road trip here but don't
worry in just a few minutes we're going
to be back at the studio and we're gonna
be building Jay are they showing any of
your ads here today I know okay I need
to get my check while I'm here
so Jay was telling me that the micro
center liquid cooling stuff over here is
provided by is supplied by frozen CPU
yeah so although there's still a basket
of goodies here that's way less than
previously experienced so and it's
looking like what we need is not going
to be here no we have now returned to
the Paul's Hardware studios first let me
show you what loot we came away from
micro Center with and zip ties there we
go
one thing that is what we came away with
so the the the depth of frozen CPU has
affected everyone's access to water
cooling components so here's our plan
let me kind of go over let me try let me
try to stop dropping things and go over
our plan now this is going to show you
guys what we're gonna do today and also
the tools that you need to do that so
the first tool is Jay right there that's
Jay's I did not mean to call you a tool
there I just meant he's a defective
means of water cooling we all know
Paul's a nickel of course inside the
case stuff you guys a little quick
refresher we have everything installed
we have everything lined up where we
want it to be and now we're planning
where where all them tubes are going to
go from where to where the tightness of
the the area that we're working with
wrap in here is going to be our most
difficult so this connection here is
difficult and that
the one back here for the upper Raider
and the lower radiator upper radiator
and lower radiator are also going to
prove a bit of a challenge but I'm
moving out along I wanted to briefly
talk about the dilemma that we
encountered when we were shooting last
week's video that dilemma was the fact
that our silicone inserts here were a
little bit too thick to actually fit
someone's rollin BIOS and hip-hop music
they were - it was a little bit too
thick to actually fit inside the PDG
tubing which is right there so those are
tubing now we kind of give a brief
explanation of that because there are
manufacturing variances and when you
have something that you want to be a
nice tight fit and and your manufacturer
you're dealing with something that's
mass-produced and maybe not specifically
for this purpose that's being
mass-produced for many different
purposes but in this case we're using it
for this the solution is basically to
sand this tube so Jay has done some work
sand in the tube a bit actually
the fine folks over primo chill sent us
some pre sanded tubes but if you run
into this a problem at home you can sand
your own tube I don't recommend doing
that if you're not at least a little bit
prepared if you want to sand your tube I
recommend some fine grit sandpaper you
don't want it to be too painful
I had theorized that you could maybe
like do a drill fitting on this and spin
it but JLo sand that's proved to be very
difficult because of the flexibility of
the tube so guys if you encounter this
issue and and we have to give a big
shout out also to Richard aka Darth
Beavis for providing us a little bit of
tips there as well sanding down the tube
first and then also using lubricants
such as a olive oil olive oil is what
Richard recommended and Jay what reused
revert extra-virgin olive oil
expanding your tube and then Jay wants
to be like soapy water soap and water
okay so soap and water is another
a little easier to clean out but the
extra-virgin olive oil has a little bit
better viscosity okay so if you're
looking for viscosity then that's the
way to go and again the idea here is
that this tube this silicone tube the
flexible one should just barely be able
to fit inside the PE TG tubing you want
it to actually be a little bit difficult
to get in there because the tighter the
fit there the better the quality of your
bends and you're going to have the
subject to life less collapsing unless
deformation of the tube itself which is
something that J has never experienced
right okay whatever deformation of the
tube or my tube all right guys so um I'm
just messing around here down okay
they're done that's the world set it's
the worst thing ever we're getting all
set though so yeah so I'm guys over the
next few minutes here we're going to
take a look at these fittings and again
I got to warn you guys right up front
here although we're already probably
four or five minutes into this video
this is a temporary solution these
obviously are chromed and we're going to
want black we're going to set something
up right now that will be functional so
we can do the tube bending and get
everything running and get the loop
going and then I'm going to be getting
some black fittings that I'll replace
this I'm going to drain the fluid this
one has to go at a later date so apart
from the bills kind of all the building
that we've done so far and the planning
that we've worked on there are some
tools that you might need for this type
of venture this is the cheapest heat gun
that they sell at Home Depot it's about
22 bucks does the job it was over in the
paint section if you're wondering don't
buy the $80 one that's by itself telling
you like oh they only have one and it's
80 bucks no that one's that one's much
cheaper we also have a hacksaw so we can
cut the tubing to length should again
get the job done we've got some scissors
that you might need for cutting flexible
tubing and then apart from that that's
really all there is there are some
additional tools you can get for this
sort of thing like there's a what is it
there something the pre
Oh chill has which is like a big metal
piece in it it lets you line up the
tubing on it so you can figure out what
angle so you can get like really precise
45-degree angles or that sort of thing
but Jay said those are for people who
don't know how to do hard line tubing of
course if you see any other youtubers
out there who are using that method and
using that tool you should give them a
hard time for it for not being able to
just freehand it because I've heard J's
J seems very intensely he's looking in
there very intensely baby okay ladies
and gentlemen boys and girls that don't
use that editing Pole future vault you
ignore that so I have two different
pieces of tube right here one is PE T G
and one is acrylic now on the surface
these look entirely the same but I want
to point out that PE T G if you can kind
of get in closing so jagged that is when
you use like a deeper tool very very
thick area because it's so soft it
actually kind of turns jagged when you
when you go to deeper it so let's say
you're gonna you just cut this and you
want to deeper this because it has edges
all over it
in fact let's just go ahead and
demonstrate there awake blade alright so
when you cut PT g latest because it does
heat up and stuff you get all these
little Scout turn kind of yellow - oh so
when you go to deeper this normally you
just rub this tool on it and it cuts off
all those Devers but as you can see it
makes it still kind of rough see how
rough and jagged it is that's pretty
ropey acrylic actually you can listen to
the difference in tone to see how much
smoother that is so and the smell is
different TDS you smell it is well so
when you cut acrylic it's actually
easier to work with but acrylic is not
preferred we'll talk about different
reasons you can kind of see right there
you see the spider cracks oh yeah yeah
what are we doing why are we doing it
alright so after carefully looking at
situation with radiators up here Jay
decided when all of the connectors both
ends and outs for the rads at this end
two on the top here then two on the
front here it's very crowded up in there
so we're going to try to do is flip this
360 on top it's going to put the two
connection points on this side which
will give us a lot more room to work
with for connecting up the CPU blocks
and I do feel up over here this is going
to limit our access for this rear fan so
we might probably going to need to just
ditch that fan entirely which we should
be okay with we might consider dropping
a 120 in there instead at the same time
though since that we have plenty of room
for that 120 should be your bowline 20
yeah there should be but then again
since we're going with pull rads instead
of push Reds now we'll have to remake a
reassessment yes so that's the other
change that we're doing here as well so
you'll notice with the fans here and
push which looks really cool I will say
you notice where the fittings need to go
on here you have a fan right in there so
that means that you would need to go out
further before you bend away from that
for example so we're going to take these
fans off we're going to put them in pull
on the other side just that way that's
cool like that
let's see see look like we're almost
done like when I'm doing fans on top of
radiator for example I like to kind of
corner up if I can if it's not going to
affect the aesthetics of course so that
way these cables are kind of right there
next to each other and they can easily
feed down that also keeps the lengths
about the same way I do it yeah got a
third one over there
and then this is that this is the part
of the build where you need four hands
and two to hold it two more you can get
away with three hands sometimes too I
feel like you're zooming way down here
maybe alright so we're gonna teach Paul
how to finis tube as I learn how to use
this camera my god you're gonna love me
in post so because this is temporary
we're just going to need a little Bend
right there that's kind of a 45 with a
slight curve to it
it's ugly guys we know it's temporary
fittings we want to get they did not
have in stock so we're going to do now
Paul is going to plug in his gun
heat gun she can tell you how much much
how much water to this pool since I'm
using the kilowatt ice we have off low
and high or we have nothing because the
kilowatt was like using any power and
then turn off lower hi Jay what heat oh
um for PE T G we can do low I usually
use low so as we're going to do this is
the piece
Paul Paul seems to be running radar here
looks like he's a go
maybe we shouldn't run it through the
kilowatt okay so here we're gonna do
we've got a bolt soap we have got a
bending cord over there in the junk pile
somewhere through the beginning chord
you're going to drop the cord inside the
book the thing there as we splash the
computer keep things clean here okay so
pick up your little tube or your little
pipe whatever you call them capital tube
and go ahead and thread that bending
cord through it okay there we go
give me paper towel handy I did oh yeah
there everything see what I mean about
that being actually a very tight fit
just fits right in there surprisingly
hard to fit in there huh oh you know you
got to keep pushing using some olive oil
would help here too but just really not
doing a crazy Bend on this one we don't
yet twisting as you enter as you insert
it well you got to give it a little you
know it takes some finesse you know it
might be resistant at first but I feel
like some smooth-talking really help you
like hey all right that's far enough did
you enjoy that dinner that we went out
to earlier all right so basically now
you're just gonna bend it are you going
to heat it first of all okay so flip
this like face up I grab those paper
towels so basically you're going to kind
of guesstimate how much you have to bend
it based on this right here that's your
you know planning on fulfilling there so
kind of kind of look at it put it on low
heat I'll do that for you okay
and you just gonna sort of slowly rotate
it why was ooming in oh my god you were
really gonna love me of those bolts
slowly rotating
yeah then you'll see you'll feel it
started to get soft it's going to start
to kind of sag on its own soft now you
can even move a little closer to the to
the gun if you want this is the only
time you you get soft the more you're
ready that's starting to bend yep don't
force it though just keep your corset
just keep good to fascinating Oh get
free materials ladies and gentlemen this
is uh and so then we just no more no
more heat Omar hey yeah if you have to
force it it's not hot enough okay you
should be able to just put under its own
weight
bend it get in there oh yeah okay now go
ahead and start since you're not a very
aggressive bend here go ahead and bend
it to what you think matches the angle
you need over there forty-five not quite
look at the fittings over there so
that's a little much so much yeah so
keep it up keep it over the heat so you
can bend it back
okay yep pull it up
and doesn't look they've got your
blistering and crushing or anything
which we've got a little bit of twist in
there but for a first attempt might be a
good practice piece see I've got a
little bit of a bubble that I can see
yeah but if you look in there it looks
like you twisted it and zerah turning it
I did that twists it was twisted alright
so that was a good person we also see
how you're getting a kink right here
okay see that kink yeah that's that's
bad we're completely out of focus
no so that's because I'm like an event
not the camera so that kink right there
is because it was a little bit cold like
when you started to bend it and then as
you were turning it as it got hot you
you started to twist it okay so that is
a attempt number one this is a learning
experience I go and pull your to bed of
the junior huh so this is my first ever
Bend so I'm going to keep this
everything was actually good your
problem just was you started to bend it
too soon so I got I got a little excited
yellow excited excited about my first
ever two bending and then you twisted it
and so yeah so try and that's something
I wasn't even thinking about it all was
the idea that I might twist rotate one
end of it without rotating the other no
no when I when I rotate it I don't
actually keep rotating like a rotisserie
I kind of turned 90 and then hold it and
then turn 90 and then hold it I'm right
okay until it's until it's ready to bend
and then I do the bend dollar ones
oh man
we need to test this connection so we're
yet again doing the blow test Jay has
insisted that this is a crucial part of
this entire process allowed me to just
line up here ready Jay I'm ready
okay blow test successful we're going
for a very complex Bend here which we're
going to try to loop out of here back
around and then over to here it might be
funky we're going to just roll with it
though we're gonna see how things go
it's gonna be funky
really like blown on things you I
learned from you Jay
hey we said we would never discuss out
you said you would never discuss that
hey that's better than my last one is
way better I mean you could just see
where the cord ended you can see the car
it ended it so yeah you want it you want
to push it in farther Paul than you
think you're gonna need
you
you
so after a couple of moments of truth
we've had a moment of clarity all jaded
and this tube although it did fit it was
a successful Bend and it's horrible it's
not the prettiest Bend you can see we
had to do several different kinks in it
and in order to get from this point down
here to this point up here Jay since he
brought over a lovely assortment of
angle fittings has dropped a couple D's
on so we got a 90 over here and then a
little jointed kink then dole it was
only a 90 like if you vent this this way
you can see it's an ID okay but it's a
dual rotary so we use it as an offset
and the offset was actually perfect to
line up with the depth of this so now
all we need is a single tube with like a
25 degree bend in it that's in
my
and here it is everyone we have finally
completed well almost completed the
arctic panther it's been it's been a
great time Jay thank you so much for
being here for helping out with
everything and teaching me how to bend
how to been - I will gladly teach you
had a bend youtube any David well I
really appreciate it so guys I hope
you're happy with the ongoing progress
of the bill that seems much much much
more complete now as you can see we've
done all the filling we were doing a bit
of a bit of bleeding to get some of the
air bubbles out recently doing some leak
testing of course as well we went all
haphazard and we did not use any paper
towels we were relying on the white
fluid to tell us if there were any leaks
and anyways I'm gonna I'm going to
suggest that you set this up to run
tonight
okay put paper towels in there and let
it go all night long okay usually the
paper towels are because it's easy to
see like especially like red fluid and
colored fluids and but white fluid
dripping on a white paper towels might
not be hot so but since nothing powered
up in the system if you did get some
sort of a leak you wouldn't damage
anything okay so that we good other than
that guys like we've mentioned several
times there's still more work to be done
on this there's some finishing touches
of course thus leaving on the power
supply is a big thing and the side panel
mod that's coming up I'm going to be
handled that pretty soon and at some
point you're still going to switch all
these chrome fittings out yeah lock so
that we were kind of debating that so
let us know down in the comments guys we
went with these chrome fittings because
Jay had them on hand and they made the
bending process much simpler as you can
see and I think there was no getting
around it yeah there's just there's just
not quite enough space in this case to
do all the nice straight clean bends
like we wanted so the fittings I think
work out and actually don't look too bad
with the chrome I I think I'm leaning
towards switching them out for black
ones though I think that'll just look
that'll stick with the black and white
thing overall but let us know what you
guys think in the comments section down
below of course don't forget to like the
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel if you haven't already
subscribed to subscribe to Jay's channel
because he does this all the time and if
you're into water cooling builds you
definitely definitely check out his
channel if you haven't already and other
than that links that are down in
description to all these products thank
you thank you thank you once again to
all the hardware sponsors for this build
I'm going to run down them one more time
ek and primo chill first of all for the
water cooling components primo chill
especially for today they provided all
the tubing all the fittings as well as
the fluid that we used
it's called yang sickle which you
probably can't read and I notice this
prototype on there but they they did say
it was okay to use your hold on there we
go this is the fluid that we're using
from primo chill yang sickle came out
nice and dense usually sometimes you can
get a bit of a a nonfat milk yeah look
from from this type of thing but um
looks pretty clean and then just lightly
translucent it means that solid white
but it looks good it matches your block
bourbon and it goes it goes very well
with the block so can't be happier with
everything that's been done today so
stay tuned for the sleeving video stay
tuned for the side panel mod video and
I'm going to do a final cleanup of this
one and I'll give you guys some really
sexy shots with all getting my slider
out and all that good stuff but for
tonight thanks again guys so much for
watching we'll see you all next time and
have a pleasant evening
this is hello everyone we're reporting
to you today from the surface of the Sun
