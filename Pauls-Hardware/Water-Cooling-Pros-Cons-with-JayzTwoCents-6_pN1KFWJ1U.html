hardware this video is a very very
special video and I have a very very
special guest this is Jay from Jays two
cents oh you don't mean yes when you
said special so well I meant it Jay
because what I'm about to embark on is
probably the most ambitious build
project that I have done in my history
of building computers which is because
this is going to be an epic water-cooled
build so just to start from from the
beginning going back quite a while I had
made a promise to my friend Jay Jay over
at Asus that I was going to be using
their x99 motherboard
in an epic build so we've got that over
there the xi9 deluxe from Asus that's
going to be kind of the holding
everything together
that's the motherboard the CPU is going
to be this one right here I 7:59 30 K
from Intel so it's a haswell-e socket
2011 - 3 and I'm really excited to see
how would you do with your 59 60 X I'm
curious the 59 60 X is in the test bed
so that's what I've been using - seems
like such a waste benchmark a waste what
are you talking about things are always
an epic water-cooled build deserves an
epic CPUs are you saying I should swap
and put the 59 60 X in this I personally
would that could be an option I could
use a 59 30 K and the 59 60 X that I
have is actually really nice you order
you've got a nice bin right now it's at
4.5 gigahertz uh 1.2 volts yeah and to
get 14.5 online its 1.3 to 5 volts so so
maybe that's a consideration that's
another thing that I want to do in this
video guys so I'm going to be asking for
your feedback so here's the first bit of
feedback I have another really important
question for you at the end of the video
so stick around for that should I stick
with a 59 30 K or should I take Jays
advice and go with 59 60 X it's one of
those things where if you were out of
pocket right now man on it and you
didn't already have them I would say 59
30 but since you have both I do have
both actually have all three don't you I
do have off their ever plan for the
third one as well so because my test
bench has the
5820k but I think for the testbench
purposes that was a perfect CPU for yeah
yeah oh yeah too much 960 X I think
given the hardware you're gonna talk
about right now is definitely okay all
right we're already making changes but
I'm excited about that that's that makes
it I like them shake the tree seems
falls out thanks all right let's go over
the rest so I need to say huge thank you
to g.skill because they sent me over my
memory kit since this system is going to
be used extensively for video editing I
needed lots of memory 32 gigs is in my
opinion the good amount of memory to go
that's more than I have action I'm a
little jealous really yeah I will always
just had 16 gigs just 16 well I will say
for video editing 32 is really nice I
mean depending on the complexity the
project that you're working with
everything this is 24 hundred speed
memory from g.skill ripjaws 4 it's the
black version that Jake is also using
one I'm using in skunk works only you
have the 8 gigabyte DIMMs right before
gigabyte is yes and I think yours are a
bit faster than this but I think 2400
for my price 24 oh you're just 2400 -
and I'm running them at 2666
I'm not even fart like overclocked much
at all nice well excellent these this
has been excellent memory I've been
using the rip test for and the test bit
as well have a 16 ki kit over there so
huge thank you to G scale for that and I
think I'm gonna do the same thing unit J
and pull the stickers off of there yeah
just to keep everything cuz this is
going to be a black and white theme to
build so there's my memory for storage
I have Samsung's new SSD this is the 850
Evo that they sent over so this is a 250
gig the operating system is going to go
on here I'm going to be expanding the
storage and the system but I'm probably
going to do that after the whole thing
is built since that's something you can
actually can't afraid with a water
cooling system water-cooled system after
the fact yeah and you don't even need a
huge SSD I mean I have a 5 I have a 500
gig and a 256 in mine
I just put my favorite games on the 256
the 5 the 500 gig is barely being
touched but you do have more standard
hard drive storage and I do I have a 2
terabyte and a 1 terabyte so this is my
so I have a thing about raw footage
whenever I record something and then I
copy it because that right now I'm not
recording straight to a computer but
whenever I copy my raw footage I have a
thing I want to always copy it to a raid
1 array just because that's something
that you're replaceable I can go and
recreate a premier project or something
like that
but this is a four terabyte WD black
drive this is actually standing right
now because what I'm going to be using
is the 2 4 terabyte WD black drives that
I have in my system that I'm using right
now is my primary system so those will
be migrated over and then I also have a
500 gig dual SSD raid 0 array that I
edit off of that I I copy the raw
footage to my mechanical drives then
copied again to the SSDs and then I edit
off of there so that's saying you can do
all that and you in in the case you're
going to use I'll let you talk about the
case but that's the downside of the case
labs case is it's not really designed
for natively supporting a lot of hard
drive to optical hard drives or at
optimal yeah to hard drives and for SSDs
is the support oh wow
so unless you buy additional hard drive
cages which go in the main part in our
ugly which takes away room for the water
cooling setup I just AM gimped on hard
drive capability in that case so the
case you're using is obviously meant for
that the case Oh excellent segue J thank
you uh over to the case so this is the
case and this was a question that I
asked you guys so this is the fractal
define r5 mid tower computer case really
really well received so far it launched
at the end of 2014 and Ashley it was so
well received there were some people
that thought that fractal bought those
reviews because really no III I saw some
comments of like why is every single
review were calling this like the best
case at the price point period because
it is because if you look at the fractal
define r4 which is hugely popular and
there were some things people said hey
if you did this the divine r4 would be
like just balls to the wall excellent
and they did it and this is what they
did with the divine r5 so as a promise
to you guys everyone said I had a lot of
suggestions for that but I had a lot of
people said go for it
epic water cooling building to define r5
so that's our reason for the case the
power supply I'm actually also going to
be using a fractal Newton I think a
thousand watt this is what I'm going for
for that that hasn't arrived yet but
that will also be here for the power
supply so big thanks fractal for those
and then lastly the parts I had been
waiting on just so I could do this video
because we're going to be going over the
water clean stuff here pretty soon is
the graphics cards and
I knew I wanted gtx 980 s because
they're kind of the newest and fastest
GPUs that are out there keep you snob
well that's always my opinion when you
go for when you're going for custom
water-cooling i feel like you should
already have the top things and then you
want to push it beyond that that's right
we'll talk about that more yes so we're
going to do a little we're gonna do a
little pro and cons here in just a
second so these are the gigabytes g1
gaming windforce edition gtx 980 s and
these things are absolute monsters they
are the fact they're so heavy you would
think there was already water blots on
there yeah it's got a massive copper so
the let's just move into the next
section alright so gigabyte g1 gaming
GTX 980 s 2 of these I'm going to be
going for a 2-way SLI configuration with
the 980 s and these are going to be
water cooled with EK water cooling
components which are solid copper oh yes
what didn't have makeup nickel version
and copper versions and that's a big
reason why I invited Jay over here was
because the water cooling side of it is
something that I admittedly have not
delved into a whole lot so let's let's
go in the neck the section 2 of this
video and I'm sad to admit I probably
have every water cooling skew memorized
on the market which I do not so I'm glad
you're here Jay to help out was for this
particular aspect so let's talk about
water cooling let's talk not about your
your all-in-one loops that are very
accessible and easy to find these days
let's talk about custom full-blown
individual water cooling where you have
a reservoir you've got a block on the
CPU you've got a block from GPU you're
looping them all together you're
building it yourself and deciding where
each component should go and how the
loop should run and what radiators to
use and all that good stuff now I have
not done this very much and and here are
my reason all I've done it yes ok what I
haven't done is built for myself a full
water-cooled system I've never done that
I've done of course the minor water
cooling with all-in-one loops and I have
setup custom loops for testing like the
asus poseidon graphics card i set up a
little basic look at that so I'm
familiar with it I've set it up and I've
helped other people with water cooling
builds but I don't have that breadth of
experience where I've done it many many
times right in the past excuse me so
here's a real little in your eye burp
that kind of broke this I was like but I
recovered it is a scary thought and it
seemed overwhelming when your first
personal build is going to be an extreme
build like this which you know you kind
of have almost no no limit on what you
can do and no and that's a scary thought
it's a scary thought so the reasons I
have it done water cooling the past and
then I'm going to ajaita tell the
reasons he has because I think there's a
lot of reasons on both sides and it
depends kind of who you are and where
you're at in the industry but the
reasons I haven't is because to my mind
it's it's a heavy investment a full
custom loop is probably going to run you
three four hundred bucks minimum oh
three women a six and good night sleep
yeah if you're going for really really
simple for just the CP but for just CPU
but but if you want to go beyond that
your product in six seven hundred eight
hundred bucks at least at least and lose
fittings and all that stacks skunkworks
for instance even if it were a two way
can fake is it's three way which you
know each each graphics card block is
going to run you 120 bucks around there
abouts plus the backplate if I do back
plates another thirty and you've got you
got two of them so you're talking two
hundred and fifty plus dollars just for
GPU yeah and that doesn't include
fittings or pipes or any of that and
that's just that
so it's substantial and to my mind I've
always shopped for computer parts with a
very like kind of frugal right right
viewpoint and to my mind I'm like well
after you drop all that stuff in after
you overclock your cpu and your GPU
because that's really where you're
getting the benefit is the overclocking
and also possibly that the noise
performance if you're going for very
silent type of but I'm feeling this is
going to be a long video guys to strep
it that's alright it's gonna be okay
it's gonna be like it's me a couple
podcast I like these types of discussion
but I'm like 3d printing discussions
with Jerry man I can go all day we're
water going oh that's a that's another
video entirely but but it's it's never
made that much sense to me to invest
that amount of money for the performance
improvement you get where if you're
already running top top level components
you're going to get what maybe another
ten fifteen four to nine 80s it's not
going to help your max overclock really
much if at all
okay you might get five percent on top
of your where you are going to be with
these coolers especially with these cool
does it cost to performance ratio of
your water cooling loop at this hard
work you know where you are now it's
probably
going to be a way upside down it's not
going to make sense but really you know
it comes down to you have the best
hardware and you kind of want to take it
to that next level but yeah that that is
one of the cons of water cooling is the
cost to investment on return for
performances is a little bit upside down
so if you're looking at this strictly
from an ROI perspective start it's it's
not that great and then the other thing
that comes to mind and that's all
literally only because we have these
gigabyte g1 gaming graphics cards is I
feel like the graphics cards that you
want to water cool and and are the ones
that have the nicest frickin coolers on
them by default right because the
companies that they put a little effort
they build their own PCB they do special
stuff with the power delivery and
everything like that back plate and then
they over build it they drop a back
plate in there very nice back plate and
and then they have this epic cooler on
here which if you're if you're just
dropping this in a system is is
fantastic this is what 300 now this
one's even more about 50 right it's near
500 watts yes okay so the amount of heat
dissipation this this cooler has is
absolutely phenomenal yeah um so what
we're gonna do when we are cool is take
that off and not use makes a good just
led somewhere
it does actually have yeah I have the r9
290 X's just the coolers up back there
so they do look nice but just to kind of
end on that point of return on
investment is where I started with water
cooling the whole reason it existed was
the hardware at the time was incredibly
hot I mean they had made some amazing
advancements in technology when it comes
to TDP and he you know generation
generated inside the components and you
had to water cool to get to the next
level as you were hitting thermal caps
before you ever hit you know performance
or voltage limits so as those
progressions have have advanced and
evolved over time over the last let's
say 10 or 12 years I've been doing it
it's started to make even less sense
because you can get the same performance
out of air as you could at the time with
water so that makes perfect sense
especially we go back to like but like
Pentium 4 days that sort of thing yeah
those land like the GTA in the GTX 8800
ultras 8800 DTX 400 series
well the foreman of series was notorious
just a furnace good lord yeah so those
are some more benefits that you might
have had if you go back if you use an
industry but obviously I'm doing this
build so the the cons I've mentioned
just now I was able to get over so let's
talk about the pros now
there's a lot of code now obviously
keeping your components cooler could
potentially extend extend their lifespan
I think that's a benefit the noise
factor I think is one that originally I
was like Oh build a water-cooled system
you don't need anything this was like
way way back yeah it's like you don't
need any fans to cool it and then it's
completely silent well you still need
fans but by taking the heat that's being
generated by your GPU and CPU moving
them to a big radiator you can have
large fans that don't need to spend too
fast and you can get a acquirer running
system at that you're going for
or you can add more radiator space for
larger surface area and go with super
slow fans like 500 600 rpm so that'd be
nice that's an open I think I'm gonna
lean towards making us a nice quiet
system I think I think that's so equal
of course with the performance in there
as well now I think the number one
reason though when it comes down to like
if you're going to do a system like this
today right now with current generation
hardware is just like for the love of
DIY it's and enthusiasts it's an
enthusiast thing it's it's your hobby
you mentioned asking why I do it and
it's an enthusiast thing I'm gonna tell
you a quick story of my very first time
really dealing with are really starting
to get into water cooling okay Alex it
involved Alienware no I actually owned
for a leery pretty best buy right Oh pre
Dale Pearlman where I was like when a li
where was it started when they were like
hot yeah I mean they I had already dealt
with some water cooling stuff before we
go with fish pump acquire aquarium pumps
no and and vinyl tubing from Home Depot
and I've used that before yeah and
making your own trying to make your own
copper blocks and stuff uh it was fun
but I had I had gotten an alienware
desktop that had an all-in-one cooler in
it that had leaked though on me and so I
decided well at that point I'm just
going to go ahead and go balls to the
wall I'm going to build something custom
and it all started there I mean this was
this was 2003 2004 okay
somewhere along those lines so that's
why something going on 12 years now have
having not owned an air-cooled system
since then Wow so it's one of those
things where once you do it it kind of
becomes your own personal expectations
for your bills and so you always plan
for that if I couldn't afford to do the
water cooling at the time of build I
waited I didn't do that I'm going to
build it as air first and I'm going to
convert it later I just did it all from
day one but it's purely an enthusiast
thing really so and that's where I think
a lot of the community when it comes to
building your own PC has really kind of
gravitated towards this because building
a PC it's not as popular as it used to
be because it's not as much again as a
value proposition I originally got into
building my own computers because if you
looked at the pre-built ones and you
looked at how much you could build your
own computer for you could save 250
bucks
right but then it would take really
exist at the time that's not the case
anymore you can buy a pre-built computer
and you can pretty much part out your
own computer the same and they'll be
ready to work they and get warranty so
that's our quick introduction I hope you
guys have enjoyed us rambling on about
water cooling here for a while but
that's kind of some of the pros some of
the cons I wanted to get both sides of
it here since we're just starting out on
this project there's definitely more
posing concepts there are more we could
go on but I think for the site I didn't
nutshell it though okay give me two more
minutes all right I'm not gonna get Jace
on a nutshell pros potential leaking
maintenance it's not maintenance for con
soon these are cons right wait I'm sorry
yes okay these are Blizzard these are
the good cons no I don't know okay their
cons maintenance they could possibly
leak Pro ROI is terrible that those have
kind of always been the main three
there's more work involved in the setup
and you lose you lose warranty on the
cards when you take that second part the
pros though is you can build a stylet PC
you do get thermal tons of thermal
overhead better overclocking really it
looks awesome it really does especially
put time into your loop oh yeah if you
go something like acrylic there's more
time invested but it just looks amazing
the contour kerlick is you cannot easily
maintain your system in terms of
swapping out parts not quite as flexible
as the flexible yeah yeah it's no
there's no I see what you did
haha but really in the end when it's all
done and put together you're gonna look
at it and you're gonna enjoy looking at
your PC as much as you do whatever all
you do on your piece I do I enjoy
looking at Jays computer that's become
the game for me though all right the
game for me now is the building it's the
customizing that is my game and I build
these systems and then I don't game on
them as much as I should because I'll be
gaming on it and I'll just be looking at
the system going you know what that
little thing is bugging there so I'm
going to redo the cables right I just
did all the custom cables and their
custom sleeve cables that were done by
sanctum sleeving and everyone's like
well that just seems like a terrible
waste but that's a perspective thing
that's a that's a that's a subjective
thing and and and that's what I like
doing I think you might be starting
something here that you might not be
able to put a lid on this is gonna be
this is my gateway drug I'm gonna have
to this is constantly be building and
upgrading and all of that good stuff
which I'm okay with and I actually will
say that the potential that we're seeing
here like the the kind of just started
build or the Midway build like I really
like that yeah and I think I felt like
with you where the the completed build
once it's there and it's sitting there
and it sits there for a while and you
play on it like oh this is awesome it's
really fast and then time goes by and
you start looking at Indic I could do
more like well I I'm getting ready I'm
planning to redo all of the acrylic
tubing in my system again well I hope
you'll do a video on that oh they're
probably a series all right and it's all
it all comes down to that stupid little
Bend that showed its way in the build
because of moving from z97 x99 and it
was off by one centimeter because of the
way that the pass-through fittings are
drilled so well and I'm sure I'm sure
it'll be epic once you're all finished
alright so we have two more things to
talk about on this video and one is
going to be the actual water flowing
parts which obviously aren't here right
now but we're actually going to be
picking those out now that we have the
graphics cards chosen and we know the
rest of the components of the build we
can kind of plan where everything is
going to go in the define our five what
we're going to need as far as the GPU
block CPU blocks fittings with all that
good stuff so we're gonna pull up the ek
website here and then I still have one
important question for you guys at the
end of this video so um it's going to be
a
yes or no I'm sure I know it's an
important question all right oh so we're
taking a look at the EK water blocks EK
WB website j is here my trusted
assistant
I trust him implicitly with everything
advice and looking at me funny J
but anyway so uh ek what webs just
failing failing at talking we make
videos things I'm gonna I'm gonna go
ahead and click on the online store
right over here and let's take a look at
what they got going on so we have a so
what are we going to eat here we talked
earlier not on camera but mind you but
we talked about the parts of a computer
being like case power supply motherboard
CPU memory graphics card storage and
then optical drive which is kind of more
of an option at this point what are the
primary components going into a water
cooling loop okay well you've got your
CPU okay
guaranteed needed part CPU block okay
fittings tubing pump reservoir radiator
so there's six main components that you
need okay well okay seven if you include
fluid but that's kind of a given alright
and then optional stuff obviously would
be GPU blocks any other blocks might be
like motherboard blocks or Ram blocks
which really tiers onto your limb tears
which aren't that important
yeah but in your case you're going to
need the eight right including fluid
you'll need the eight components but
you're going to be the GPU blocks as
well as the other fluids okay so should
we start with some water blocks over
here that would be a good place to start
all right you know II K's got quite the
range because they've got three
different main types of blocks okay
definitely you're going to want to go
for is so do CPU block for all right
let's take a look at that's given you're
going to want to go with the EQ
supremacy Evo that's our top end block
right there
if you've one go just no-holds-barred
well what else what else would we want
now by default they all come installed
with the Intel bracket okay which is
obviously what you want but they've got
a lot of different materials they've got
you know I've got white you can see
they've have a kind of a white acrylic
or not acrylic
the palm type of material going on okay
um I did it got like what I have on my
test bench was like a full nickel one
which looks really sick so if you're
doing a black and white build though I
would recommend probably either doing
the white which would look really good
on that X on an idol of wood or the
solid black the the clean version now
what you're going to notice is two
variants of block okay in that there's a
nickel block and a copper block for CPU
I personally always do copper that way
the nickel doesn't affect temperatures
at all it's mostly an aesthetic thing
but you don't see it and it's nice to
get that direct copper contact oh yeah
rather than going through thin micro sub
the nickel is actually plating on the
copper that goes into context it's still
copper base okay yeah alright so I
personally always do copper blocks
because they don't you can't see the
block from the perspective you're
looking at it so if I want a black that
would be this one here without a nickel
the Evo acetal right it's always going
to be copper unless it says nickel okay
and then we've got also got the white
editions alright the white edition has a
silver bracket like a nickel bracket
with the white like a palm material okay
and then you've got some colored options
or cleared you know what your just
aesthetics yeah I think I kinda want to
get the solid but I'm thinking I feel
like white I think the white would look
good on that on that day it would look
nice because there's a lot of black
going on in the case already and I think
the right would stand out a little bit
more right so there's a a look at it
there you can zoom in on the site and
everything and look at it closer
although I guess I should use the slider
it's very yes now the nice thing about
the block that I had though if you kind
of wanted to go with bling is the full
nickel block is not it's it's not an
acetal material okay it's actually metal
so there's no chance of ripping oh just
ripping the thread ah there's no chance
of stripping them okay now threads are
fittings you just want to put on hand
tight plus like a little bit of return
okay so you should be cranking him down
with a tool anyway all right well oh
look they even have the hydraulic
characteristics listed here they do but
even though I trust EK i still would
never just trust a manufacturer's chart
and always look at independent reviewers
testing real tell alright so there's
kind of like fan specs right yeah you
look at manufactures
fan specs and they're like the quietest
most air flowing fan in the world yes
they're always the best that and that in
contrast ratio on monitors I guess
that's another thing you technically
need is fans but oh yeah yeah fans
actually that's a good question
all right we'll look into that a hundred
thousand fans actually I do
hi hi everyone head to food hi all okay
hi Billy Bobby Jo just list them all
what's the mall all right now I'm the
the thing for moving over to GPU blocks
now and I know exactly which GPU block
we're gonna get cuz the only have one
choice because there's only one choice
and it just came out now this is an
important distinction to make when
you're looking at GPU blocks for water
cooling which is any graphics card that
comes out is going to have what's known
as a reference design that's created by
Nvidia or AMD and those are often what
the GPU block manufacturers will come
out with first right because they have
the widest yeah because they vets that's
the sample they get for some companies
like ek actually had very good
reputations and right and relationships
with the board designers like in video
named d so oftentimes they'll get an
engineering sample first so that they
can offer either day one or month one
options which I know was the case for
the 960s and such okay um so yeah
reference designs are always going to
come out first one off board partner
PCBs like the Strix or the DCU two or
the gigabyte g1 gaming those always take
time to develop because EK has to either
request or buy the blocks and then do
all of the research and tooling and
manufacturing oh my god I got a vet them
all and install them and make sure that
they're keeping all the different Grice
writing that sort of thing let's do a
and those blocks are actually
manufactured down to like micron
whelming that microns but super super
accurate because the last thing you want
is to create down your block and have it
squish your piece your heat spreader on
your GPU which will crush your die oh
yeah you know what that in fact you
cannot it is impossible to over-tighten
the Nikkei water block and damage your
graphics card because the threads
literally stop on the screws and the
female screw ports okay without damaging
your cards you could crank it down
you'll strip it out before you damage
you now I think because I've been
looking for the the proper water block
down here and I think it's actually not
listed on their store yet it just came
out I think like the first week of is
like yes so this is this is the water
block dated for the GTX 980 gaming the
do you want the gaming G one so they
have it in nickel that's what they do
have a few variants of it they have
they're gonna have a full cover block
which is like the black when you're
seeing there and then they have a
partial which is not a full what's up
it's still okay let's talk about real
quick difference between full cover and
not full cover okay full cover means it
touches the GPU the RAM and the VRM
that's a full cover some people think
full cover means it has to go from end
to end dunnies not covered the entire PC
right full cover just means you're
covering all of the heat generated
components with the block okay then the
as you can see you have the the clear
nickel version which is shorter now the
reason why some people do that and they
have a black one usually in most cases
it's lighter okay once you put that
solid cover on which my my 980 s have
especially put a backplate to they are
heavy you're gonna be dealing with a lot
of it there's no way super heavy so as
you can see that just you know you have
some of the plexi there which is you
know giving you some aesthetic overhang
from the block itself but that block is
going to be considerably lighter than
say that one and this is the one I think
we're going to be going with which is
full cover but that I love the clean
look of yeah it's super clean nice black
finish you just got a little bitty kalo
going on going on right there and it has
screws that hold it down onto the block
which is purely oh that's beautiful
yeah that's its I love the super clean
look so that's going to be the GPU block
and then we have some other choices
while making an option with that as
backplate so you gonna do a backplate
that's a good question now you I don't
think the g1 gaming back plates are
going to work with that oh so they went
it wouldn't so we wouldn't need their
design with these blocks or design in
fact you should you should check it and
see if it mentions it the design of
their threading like I mentioned is
specific to their block so that you
don't over tighten okay so technically
you could potentially over tighten it by
not having the screws go all the way
through because of the backlight right
so we want to make sure that now since
the 980 full cover block isn't listed on
a story
it I'm guessing so G one game yeah I'm
sorry g1 gaming block isn't listed on
the story I'm guessing it will have a
backplate so they will have a backplate
so we might not be able to show you guys
that right now usually the backplate
options for ek are solid black it's
called they called the jet the jet
stream okay I believe they call it jet
stream it's like a solid black which has
a real nice brushed effect in it which
my what my blocks have for my back
plates but usually they have a nickel
one as you can see right there they have
nickel blue red yellow so that's why I
asked then the nickel looks really good
if it's blingy and I kind of wished it
had done a white powder coated version
honestly that would be cool because
because they didn't even offer nickel
back plates or any of that until the
Galax Hall of Fame cart became popular
oh yeah then they needed a white option
to go to white PCBs that's the funny
thing because of all the video cards
with back plates that I've seen the
Galax ones that I have the white PCB is
the one where I'm like you can go
without a black back plate on that like
yeah although all the extra money they
invest to get that pure white PCB it's
like that it right there I think this is
it one zero is three back plates so
there's the back plate that we're gonna
go with again very clean look and very
very straightforward just got the ek
logo no no there's a lot of discussion
about back plates and there's a reason
why I put back plates on it yeah
everyone knows I'm a stickler for back
plates I always get a little bit you
know anal when companies don't put back
plates on high-end cars yeah it's an
aesthetic thing and also if you
developed a drip somewhere say your CP
blockers oh yeah and it drips down on
the back of those cards the back plate
will give you some protection so you get
some more protection that's a part of
its a very practical I like I like when
something maybe is a little aesthetic
benefit but then when it actually has
some practicality added there you go
look on forms and things that people
who've had water cooling catastrophes
they always end up losing GPU because it
drips on the Jeep yeah yeah that's
terrible that's a terrible thing to lose
as well alright so there's our back
plate moving right along we're gonna
need a pump or reservoir which we go
furnish they actually have combo units
oh well which are there's a lot of
options now a lot of companies have
found that in order to make them fit in
cases more friendly there are pump
reservoir combos but they don't take
vertical one with the tube and then the
pump sits at the bar right right which
would be more like the
the Ling DDC style pump okay which is a
much smaller pump typically much more
noisy though then you have the laying d5
pump which is the bigger heavy-duty like
monstrous pump but usually variable
speed much quieter at lower rpms I see I
want quiet so maybe that would be a good
good way to go
no so the ek personally only offers
reservoir um pump combos that are based
up actually no they actually do have the
D 5 series I take that back maybe five
yeah so but the only thing I don't like
about those personally is the reservoirs
are only the small versions okay they
don't have say that the 200 millimeter
reservoir I like it a big res because it
makes it easier to bleed and fill the
system okay so in that case should we go
with the separate then not a combo yeah
a consideration at this point is gonna
be like where in the case is the pump
right and how many can having to have
those hard drive cages you can have its
dull that's the other thing
well I think I can get away with with
just the lower one or possibly even just
hanging the one from the top it would
probably be okay cuz you're gonna have
more than two you also to keep in mind
your radiator placement you're gonna
have a tough red and a fret red because
if you do that in that case you can only
do a 360 and a 240 in the front hmm
especially if you're going to do a 360
on the top I think you might lose the
top now an option for the hard drives I
think you're right it's good question
this is the part that makes water
cooling a PC is pain in the ass this is
any times you think you've got it all
figured out in the parts coming you
start the build and you realize then he
really doesn't have it off you have to
have to go back to the drawing board and
figure something out so um let's just
check in here yeah off it
here we go scientific way of checking so
in that case where would you go from
this point would you be taking the case
apart and measuring things or would you
just kind of ballpark it you know
everything I've ever done has been
ballpark ballpark I'll admit I like that
I like that I've never busted a
measuring tape I like to shoot from the
hip
all right so in that case uh because we
want a taller reservoir right now there
is an option that you can do with these
you can make
your own you go back to the to the
reservoir combos okay actually where I
put that area and then look at the EKG
five series okay and let's say the
middle one right there with the one one
forty d5 all right I still think this
would probably be your best option but
this one here is just the reservoir you
have to actually add the pump if you
look at the other pictures you'll see
that you have to you have to thread the
pump into it okay but that still might
be your best option in terms of compact
and function that's cool in this case
because you're not going to use you're
not going to use the the optical bays in
this thing because you're going to do a
360 read the top of you know yeah okay
so something like this it will fit in
there it won't take up too much space
and it could probably fit that in the
nice hard jacket or maybe mount
something on top of a hard drive cage
yeah yeah that's a possibility as well
alright so and you might even have room
to still between the motherboard and the
cages although the way that the
motherboard tray on this case kind of
tapers you that that was the one
drawback I didn't like about the r5 was
the recessed motherboard tray yeah
that's that's it's convenient in some
situations but inconvenient and others
right definitely
alright so that's a good one like that
and you said the d5 is the pump that you
that you like as far as I like the defy
power in noise generation right okay so
let's go over to radiators shall we it's
funny the DDC the smaller pump uh-huh
actually has a higher flow rate okay but
the d5 has higher head pressure which
you're going to want higher head
pressure when you have all these blocks
in it so it's kind of like the
horsepower versus torque conversation in
cars
ah v5 is like the v8 and the DDC is like
a turbo import okay so we want we want
torque yes we do it with all of this
restriction you're gonna have yes cool
all right so uh that's block that's a
reservoir and pump radiators yeah all
right let's take a look at that
and here we want a 360 for the top
mm-hmm and you think you should go dual
radiators here you're gonna have two you
get two guys alright assemble 360 even a
thick rent would not be not not going to
be enough right alright so for 360 we
have the cool stream the X DX X DX DX
you could fit that up top here if you
click on it it's very it's a very clear
it's like a 60 ml red that's really
thick it's it's double thick compared to
standard grads
oh wow so on that one there you would
have to use the built-in offset melt
okay in here but I don't know how that's
going to affect your front radiator with
hard drive capability yeah that's
another possibility so why don't we
thinking especially since we're doing
two radiators I can probably get away
with not DX the XTX not the thick one
yeah your batteries right now oh yeah so
we should probably wrap this up alright
so we got the cool stream W e360 right I
would be confident in you using the ek
cool streams okay they have higher fin
density so it gives you more dissipation
there 30 mil thickness and I would
personally be comfortable using that
some with the dual oh wait that's the
wrong read thought I clicked on the 360
it's it 366 dual oh yeah so that's going
to be like the two 180 millimeter oh
yeah they're adding more sizes to this
lineup and they do have we had more
stuff coming so there you go so I would
be I would feel confident using a triple
one of these coupled with a 240 version
okay that works so we'll have a 360 and
a 240 300 316 the top 240 in the front
right that'll give us plenty of us about
to say areal density but that refers to
hard drives I meant to say fin density
or surface area right so that's what
we're looking for with Hierophant with
higher fin density radiators though you
typically need a higher static pressure
fan but EK has a really good design on
that radiator I did a review of it where
you can still run low low speed fans
like say the NVE loop fans okay and get
a ton of airflow through it
that's good so I think we'll go with
that for the radiators and then lastly
we have accessories it's going to be
fittings fittings tubing and tubing and
I like a dance we'll be in there alright
so and and the fans are also in here so
ek has a basically E case fans are Gilad
or gallop and okay oh and they do but if
you look they have a new fan you
remember the remember the ever-popular
gentle typhoons oh yes I have something
basically a brother Oh beautiful I
really really liked him back all the way
from like 1200 rpm up to 3000 rpm yeah I
have a couple - 1800 rpm versions and
guess what they're beautiful they made
black ones really yes oh okay guess
who's gonna be doing a review I think I
might need to get some of those then
alright so um tubing sighs we're gonna
half inch little wide what do you like
3/4 uh I if I'm doing soft tubing I do
like the 1/2 inch okay because it offers
less restriction over the length of the
loop but we're gonna probably do acrylic
right if you want to do acrylic yeah
it's gonna be small to me like 13
millimeter okay
wheeze really that's a misconception we
can put the bed right now guys tubing
sighs in terms of computer builds does
not affect performance
alright : capacity whatsoever so thank
our tubing does not equate to better
cooling yeah but we're we're talk about
computers of course computers yeah
alright so then in that case my test
bench is running 3/8 so okay all right
so 3/8 inner diameter right yeah the
only hard part about it is you're
dealing with like standard versus metric
now like you're looking at a site that's
out in Slovenia oh yeah so they're very
into the millimeters swear I'm cool with
that
yes I still have never memorized all
this right and we have a nickel black
nickel and then we got all black yeah
but that's for soft tubing you can do
soft to me or Chrome no I'm doing
kerlick tubing yeah anything chances are
I knew that chances are I don't know if
they even have I know they sell their
own line of acrylic tubing know if they
have the fittings you have to check them
out no okay um but primo chill is still
kind of my go-to brand for acrylic
fittings okay
the got the revolver fittings double
over
down there they're actually they're
actually really really good all right so
we might need to diversify our
opportunities here when it comes to the
fittings and all the fittings are
showing their soft tubing these are all
soft tubing compression fittings right
cool oh there they are they're hard
rigid connectors hard tubing connectors
oh look these have colors these are also
compressions
okay now the HD adapters those are
basically they're built in like SLI
bridge between motherboard
oh sorry between graphics cards okay
kind of like the they're very similar to
the bits power ones make the crystal
links you you can go ahead and get out
of or no you're in the red section
you'll want to definitely go with yeah
get out of HD adapters and go to the
rigid connector here HDC yeah they call
it their heart hard line something
another hard yeah and so there you go
you can get those and they will actually
screw down and the o-ring will compress
as you tighten it and that will keep the
tube secure
okay then and it will be leak free
beautiful the original rigid tubing
stuff could easily under pressure pop
out though because there was nothing
holding in it it just pressure fit yeah
so they've come a long way on that and
they do offer white which could probably
look really good okay so we got white
finished fittings available in here so
we need to get a set of these to match
all right fittings that we need today
you've got a 12 millimeter by G quarter
threads right okay G quarter thread is
the stand or threading will find in all
your blocks some European companies like
alpha cool like to do also a G 3/8 which
is bigger doesn't it's not compatible
with most components okay
but at the IC 12 millimeter see if they
have any 13 millimeter I see 12 and 16
yes so you might end up going with
another brand or the fittings and the
reason why I say that and I love you k
they're just starting to get into rigid
stuff okay is 12 millimeter is thin wall
which makes bending a bit more
complicated Oh probably a lot easier to
like that one millimeter makes a huge
difference banding okay so that's
something especially since this I mean
Jays got experience with that but I'm I
want to get in there and do some myself
so we might want to go with something
that's a little bit more friendly
towards possible ya mess ups or whatever
the last thing you should probably keep
in mind with fittings o especially
acrylic is you have a choice you have to
make are you going to bend it if you do
you need to buy a bending kit mm if
you're not going to bend it then you
need to take into account all the extra
elbow fittings you're going to need to
make the bends so you can go straight
acrylic tubing in the noose fittings for
the bends of the right which is actually
very quick and easy to install you cut
it down to length and then use you know
dual 990 fitting that has you know
female ends on both sides that you put
two more kerlick fittings into and then
just plug them in and there's your Bend
okay it looks a lot more cluttered that
way it actually looks good on some
builds but bending is always the
cleanest look kind of cheapest depends
how like utilitarian you want if you
decide to do the the fitting bending
method mm-hmm expect your fittings to
run you three four or five hundred
dollars depending on the things yeah
that's a plus every every time you need
to angle the the direction then yeah
so I think I'm gonna go I think we're
gonna bend we're gonna bend the acrylic
I kind of like that idea
a little bit more plus you save on the
fittings that way and excellent that
that pretty much wraps up like Canada
the parts I think that that we're going
to go with here we need to get this all
out of the carton itemized and all that
kind of thing and I need to count this
up so don't worry guys I know this video
has been very long but trust me there's
more more to come since this is just the
initial kickoff for this build but I
told you at the beginning and thank you
for coming to the end of the video if
you listen to the beginning watch the
whole thing that very important question
for you now Jays build right now his
primary system has a really cool code
name I was trying to think of a code
name for my build that also sounded
equally badass so I was thinking of
possum factory I'm thinking awesome
factory project foo Manchu project foo
Manchu cuz cuz that's like your thing
like this here that that's not a
fulfillment of adventure you gotta have
going all the way around everything has
its soul patch its project soul patch
perhaps project names are always a heart
you know you're like possum factory
skunk skunk works possum factory I guess
but your I thought that I thought that
was hilarious but now I'm just I'm I'm
kidding um but I like Lockheed Martin so
that's why I did
so that in the case looked very very
stealth fighter II with the color yes
and it made it made perfect sense for
that built so my my build is black and
white
overall we've talked about a lot of
components that are going in so stock
works could have worked for you that's
what the best earlier skunkin makes
sense for that but now wait so we need
it we need a name for this build I
haven't decided on one yet I have a few
ideas kicking around but I think you
guys might with the power of your
combined minds and intellect maybe could
think of something that really fits for
this build so consider the parts that
are in here consider that we got fractal
stuff we yes gigabyte video cards we got
ek components going in there asus
motherboard epic build project black and
white it's like product wash pit going
on mosh pit I like that we have a nice a
nice blend of manufacturers going on in
this build too I always kind of like
taking multiple I always like to name it
though based on kind of the aesthetics
okay right so like for me things that
come to mine are not like I don't know
if you're trying to go it's like funny
but like for me like project monochrome
seems kind of crappy well it's black and
white right because it be very little
color in there the names that I think
appeal most to me are the ones I got
chromatic the ones I have dual meanings
I like it to have multiple like you can
look at it different ways so that but is
what appeals to magic Auto chromatic so
guys let me know in the comments section
down below what you think I should name
this build because an epic name would be
cool and then I thought I had another
question I was going to ask we already
asked that earlier in the video right we
asked for some opinion on something it's
been a while this video if you guys
can't tell has been longer than
originally in plans so thanks for
sticking through us the whole way I hope
if you're thinking about building a
water-cooled system that you've learned
a little bit from this build leave us
your water-cooling questions as well
because we're going to be doing like I
said more videos following up on this
and then eventually IJ's has told me
that he will be happy to come by and
lend his hand when we actually do the
full assembly but that's still
especially always especially if you're
gonna Bend especially we're gonna bend
you'll need a lot of extra pipe I need
help an extra pipe in it if J is good at
one thing it's providing lots of
thank you pay well there was that one
Tech Talk episode
well then we'll end on that note though
so thank you guys so much for watching
this video don't forget to hit the like
button don't forget to subscribe
subscribe to Jay's channel if you're not
already it's Jay's two cents thank you
for watching this video we'll see you
