excellent
what's up guys welcome to my monthly
build video series I am testing this
build
today the Mini ITX build that I did
recently in the Corsair 3 ADT this was a
$1700 ish semi portable gaming and video
editing build that I made largely due to
random decisions that I made about what
I thought I wanted and perhaps less
about what you guys might want but more
on that in just a second this system
features four SSDs an i7 6700 K as well
as a gtx 1070 from Galax so it's made
for gaming as well as video editing and
all of it of course in the practically
unobtainable Corsair 380 t case a
discovery that I made a little bit too
late to go back on what I was doing in
this video but never mind
I still had fun so let's do the right
thing first and start with the negatives
like pulling off a band-aid it's going
to be quick and painful so what I didn't
like about this build after testing and
using it for a while was first the Galax
1070 RGB LED lighting control just
wasn't quite up to what I was hoping for
the software itself was functional but
the LED options on the card are limited
by the always-on red LEDs that are on
the fans with the white case fan that I
have on the 3dt I had pretty much three
color combinations available I nicknamed
them Patriot you and of course my
favorite tequila sunrise
anyway the software has a color wheel
and a few basic effects it gets the job
done but my main disappointment was
finding out the fan LEDs or static red
and you can't turn them off either even
though you can turn off the backplate
LED so you're matching LED color options
are very limited which is a shame there
was some mild coil wine from the GPU
under load but nothing too terrible and
then a couple negatives when it comes to
the case two of them actually and
they're pretty substantial the
availability and the size now I will
admit that I always kind of liked the
380 T it has a unique design
have a thing for cases with handles at
least mini-itx cases it launched back in
2014 but I actually never got to build
in it it is end of life now Corsair is
not making them anymore and their Web
Store that I thought had them for sale
just links to dead pages on web retail
outlets and on eBay you can find them
but they are ridiculously overpriced I
also called this case semi portable you
can carry it with the handle up on top
but it's definitely too big to fly with
as like a carry-on if you're going
somewhere a little bit more remote so
size-wise as many ATX cases go it is
definitely on the much larger side so I
completely admit this case choice was a
bit odd but I still had fun building in
it so there is that what I liked about
this build and I'll keep this part
simple is one that it's air-cooled
and since this is intended to be a
production machine I like to stay away
from liquid cooling for that reason air
coolers I think just do a good job and
they can't have like a pump fail and
stop working all of a sudden also good
overclocking not great overclocking but
definitely good overclocking I think
thanks to the airflow that's available
in the case as well it's just some
higher quality components in their
limited slightly by the motherboard but
more on that in a minute and then it
easily was able to handle gaming at 2560
by 1440 which i think is a good sweet
spot for the 1070 and also video editing
was a nice and smooth as well and even
the rendering output times we're not bad
for a poor core processor also easy to
move around or relatively easy thanks
again to that handle up on top now let's
move on to some testing overclocking
temperatures and noise to begin with the
CPU overclock I hit was 4.4 gigahertz at
1.3 5 volts now this 67 ok I have in
here I know can do 4.7 gigahertz stable
but not with this motherboard as
previously mentioned the z170 on Wi-Fi
from gigabyte is not really an
overclocking board the power delivery is
just not up to snuff for that so I ran
into some stability problems when I was
testing the system back when I was
working with it a few months ago and
since 4.4 gigahertz was stable as I
cried I'm gonna I'm gonna stick with
that that's perfectly adequate for me
the GP overclock was a little bit better
I used galaxy's extreme tuner + software
that covers the basics so you got some
speed gauges on there there are a few
conservative
set one-click overclocks that you can
engage there is voltage control and you
got your typical sliders for GPU clock
and all that good stuff
also the settings there are some startup
options and there is an in-game overlay
can turn on to show frames per second
and GP frequency and that kind of thing
you can save and load a profile with the
software but what is really missing is
like a profile system so you can easily
switch between the different settings
that you can might save so you can have
like a you know based on overclock one
and then an overclock one and then a
really overclock one but also the
ability to key in values directly would
be really welcome here you can only use
the sliders which is just a little
cumbersome and not very accurate so the
GPU overclock out of the box since this
is an overclocked card was fifteen
ninety five megahertz base clock 1785
boost 1936 was the average I achieved
under load while testing briefly without
overclocking it further myself I then of
course overclocked it further myself
with the power and temperature sliders
maxed out and then I set the fan speed
to run at 60% all the time I did plus
126 on the GPU offset and plus 202 on
the memory offset and that gave me a
base clock of 1721 a boost of nineteen
eleven it peaked at over 2100 megahertz
but if you've used any of these Pascal
cards you know that that is just a brief
fleeting moment of glory and when the
temperatures actually rise up it levels
out to something a little bit more
reasonable
so about 2020 to 2030 seven megahertz
was what this was running at under load
hitting the top temperature that these
cards are supposed to hit which is about
81 to 82 degrees Celsius as for
temperatures overall since I just
mentioned them the ambient temperature
here in my garage is cooler since it is
winter now 21 to 23 degrees Celsius CPU
temperatures well overclocked at idle
we're 21 to 25 degrees Celsius 68c while
gaming 77c while stress testing which is
a little bit high i think mainly due to
the voltage but again since i was stable
i didn't really mess with that too much
GPU temperatures at idle were 50 degrees
Celsius and that is with the fan off
mode since the fans don't span unless
the card actually has a load on it i hit
84 c max while I was doing some stress
testing but after adjusting some things
and ramping up the fan speed with my
overclock I hit 70 C under moderate
gaming load and then of course it was
peaking it right about
8281 at which point the frequency would
drop off and you know that's how GPU
boost is supposed to work and now let's
do some noise testing this is what the
GPU fan said at 60% I was just running
Union Valley on a loop and here's what
it sounds like
of course you get bonus points there if
you can hear Hiro snoring in the
background which he always does let's
move into some actual game testing
though I ran 3dmark as a synthetic test
fire strike extreme hit 8650 one on the
overall score 9370 7 on the graphics
fire strike Ultra hit 4747 overall 4731
on the graphics and 3d mark time spy hit
6040 5 overall 6220 5 on the graphics
and 5190 8 on the cpu GTA 5 and the rest
of these tests at 2560 by 1440 by the
way was 95 point 2 average frames per
second so well above 60 and 6 a new test
since I just recently got the game
running at Ultra by the way in DirectX
12 mode at 2560 by 1440 graphics test
hit 13 point 4 milliseconds average
frame time that equates to about 74 to
75 frames per second and the 99th
percentile result was 17 point 2
milliseconds the AI test which was more
of a CPU test at an average turn time of
16 point 1 3 seconds finally overwatch
2560 by 1440 139 average frames per
second just over watches a fun game so
everyone go play it and then of course
the productivity test since I will be
using this for video editing and this is
just testing with Adobe Premiere cs6
time timeline scrubbing and playback was
pretty good on a 4k project 4k can get
choppy at times depending on what you're
using for the resolution playback but I
found it to be adequate compared to the
desktops that I use and then I did a 4k
render for a project that's about 6
minutes and 15 seconds long the render
time at 4k for 45 megabits per second
was 15 minutes and 29 seconds a little
bit more than twice the length of the
project that is with some transitions
and overlays and involved in the project
as well and again perfectly adequate and
what I would expect from a 6700 K at
this frequency and so in conclusion I do
once again wish those fan LEDs on the
galaxy card were also RGB or just that
they could be turned off I think that
would be nice but the system is damn
quiet and damn powerful I don't know if
you've even noticed it's been out
hopefully you've noticed the lights are
on but it has been on this whole time
can't really hear it very well and then
I will say that that Galax gtx 1070
despite my quibble about the
sex did hit a very nice overclock
nothing crazy out of the ordinary but
was nice and stable and again nice and
quiet too so that's all for this video
guys of course you can vote in some of
the straw polls I have down below I'm
just asking you guys for some feedback
for how I do these monthly build videos
coming in 2017
check out my builds playlist there too
if you want to see more builds that
might be a little bit more reasonable at
least maybe in a case that you can
actually buy that of course stay tuned
