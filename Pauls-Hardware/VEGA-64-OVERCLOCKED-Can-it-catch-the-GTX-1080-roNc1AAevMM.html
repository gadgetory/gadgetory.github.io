excellent what's up guys and welcome to
my second ever radeon RX vega review a
couple days ago i benchmarked and
overclocked to the vegas 56 and today
i'll be doing the same with the vegas 64
the vegas 64 air cooled a non limited
edition is theoretically 499 dollars
retail which is the price I'll be using
for comparison today so the nearest
competition from Nvidia is the gtx to
1080 the vegas 56 retails for 399 again
if you can find it but as for the vegas
64 that i'm actually testing today just
FYI this is the brushed metal finish
limited edition version that you can
only get if you purchase a Radeon pack
but the performance between this one and
the 499 version should be the same so we
can cross compare I will be using the
same a testing setup that are used for
the Vega 56 testbench includes an Intel
Core i7 7700 K CPU at 4.8 years a
gigabyte or SZ 270x gaming 7 motherboard
a coarse rh1 sin 280 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler remember I have
a 2 by 8 gig kits of Kingston HyperX
predator ddr4 3200 memory running at
Casa latency 16 and for storage I have
the Windows 10 64-bit OS on an Intel 600
P Bevin and 12 gig nvme SSD and the
games on an external SanDisk all four to
one terabyte SSD connected via USB 3.0
power is provided by the courser HX 1000
thousand watt 80-plus platinum power
spot i'm on an open test bed of course I
need a GTX 1080 to compare to so I've
chosen EVGA GTX 980 for the win I see x2
again I skipped the GTX 980 founders
Edition for this manufacturer overclock
EVGA card which peaks at 1974 megahertz
under load
anyone who's running a 1080 at founders
Edition speeds is leaving performance on
the table and there's no shortage of
overclocking guides and pre overclocks
models like this available since the
cards been up for over a year already
besides I overclocked the Vegas 64 too
so I think that's pretty fair the GT X
1080 benchmarks are run with the latest
GPU driver from Nvidia that's 3/8 5.2
eight now I'm using her info 64 and they
launched a version of the AMD Radeon
settings utility to monitor
i over clocked the Vegas 64 with radion
settings as well
setting the frequency slider to plus 10%
and maxing out the voltage at 1200 i
bumped the 8 gigs of a tree and to
memory from 945 to 1050 megahertz
I set the same aggressive fan curves
that I used Vegas 256 max we had a 4500
rpm and I set the power limit to plus
50% software worked a little bit more
smoothly this time around the GPU was
operating at 1792 megahertz at least as
far as I could sell for benchmarks I'm
including the Vegas 64 in turbo mode but
otherwise it stocked the Vegas 64 with
my overclock the EVGA GTX 980 the galaxy
gtx 970 and the vegas 56 with the
overclocked numbers from my launch date
video let's start off with 3d mark
firestrike extreme and here we can see
the vegas 64 as well as overclock coming
with some pretty good scores the GTX 980
kind of slips in at rates between them
at least when it comes to the overall
score moving over to firestrike ultra we
can see pretty similar results the Vegas
64 especially overclocked is still
winning although they attend 80 is close
behind
moving over to 3d mark times by they
DirectX 12 test and here we can see the
GTX 1080 has come roaring back and the
graphics core is beating the Vegas 64
even while overclocked finally we have
3d mark VR mark Blue Room a VR specific
test and here again the 1080 performed
very well beating the Vegas 64 in both
stock and overclocked speeds let's move
into some actual games so starting with
for honor at 1920 by 1080 here again we
can see the GTX 1080 is doing a really
good job beating out to the Vegas 64
even while overclocked I also want to
point out the Vegas 64 non overclocked
if getting crept up on by the Vega 56
well overclocked
moving over to 2560 by 1440 we can see
more the same although the Vegas 64 does
make up a bit more ground while
overclocked and then finally at 4k the
1080 still hanging on to that lead
although just barely let's move on to
GTA 5 this was a benchmark that I was
surprised Andy didn't actually provide
numbers for and it's kind of obvious why
now because this is a title where the
Vega has seemingly more of a
disadvantage compared to the 1080
than it does in other titles we see a 20
plus or more frame rates lead at 1920
by 1080 we're seeing a 15 to 20 frames
per second lead even over Vegas 64
overclocked at 2560 by 1440 and we move
up to 4k the numbers get a little bit
smaller so the margins seem a little bit
shorter but still a 10 FPS lead on the
Vegas 64 overclocked moving on to
overwatch a very fun game to play and at
1080 I'm trying to focus on some high
frame rate options for people who make
you playing at 1080 on high frame rate
monitors we can see that all the cards
here actually able to achieve pretty
high frame rates and this is a 100%
render scaling so you could get even
better than this
thanks to over watch's graphics options
and how they can be moved around but
again we're seeing the 1080 overall
maintaining a higher frame rate moving
up to 2560 by 1440 again we see a bit of
a lead
it does narrow a little bit I think the
Vega 64 OC has a bit of a sweet spot
here when it comes to the 1440
resolution but then we move over to 3840
by 2160 we see the lead shrink even more
although the GTX 1080 is still winning
by just a couple frames per second our
next game is Metro last light still a
very difficult game to run and at 1080
we can see it's a little bit more of a
battle although the GTX 1080 does win
yet again pulling ahead with a a vert
frame rate of 154 frames per second
versus the Vega 64 is 150 at 2560 by
1440 again we see the Vega 64
overclocked come a little bit closer to
the GTX 1080 but still fallen away by
about 5 frames per second and then at
3840 by 2160 or 4k more the same it's
just very difficult for the Vega 64 to
keep up with the 1080 especially since
I'm using a manufacturer overclocked
version my last two titles are DirectX
12 titles starting with rise of the Tomb
Raider at 1920 by 1080 we see vgt X 1080
winning again with an average frame rate
of a hundred and twenty six point seven
maintaining a very nice minimum frame
rate there as well 2560 by 1440 the gtx
infinity wins with an average frame rate
of eighty 6.9 compared to the vega 64
OCS seventy seven point five and then at
4k 3840 by 2160
the gtx 1080 still wins although again
by just a point or point and a half
forty five point four average frames per
second versus the vega 64 OCS
four and our finals has civilization 6
in DirectX 12 mode at 1920 by 1080 all
the cards coming within about one frame
per second of each other so a bit of a
wash here but about 88 or 89 frames per
second a 2560 by 1440 again we're in the
86 to 89 frames per second range
although you could say the 1080 wins
since it did have the highest score and
finally at 4k 3840 by 2160 the Vega 64
OC comes out with the win so there it is
there's its big crowning achievement
there seventy seven point four frames
per second compared to the GTX 1080s
seventy three point eight so if you like
56 at a high resolution
apparently the Vega 64 is the card for
you now as was the case with the Vega 56
with the Vega 64 we must look at power
draw as well as performance numbers
because that is an important part of the
equation Vega in general actually has a
lot of cool features for maximizing
power efficiency and I am using none of
them in favor of getting the most
performance possible of the cards so
please bear that in mind unfortunately
though just like the Vega 56 the power
consumption story is not favorable for
the Vega 64 and the GTX 1080 is just
running much more efficiently as for
temperatures the EVGA GTX 1080 has the
benefit of a third party cooler which
does give it an advantage here so bear
that in mind the Vega 64 cards got up
into the 80s and overclocking only made
things a bit warmer from there and I'm
taking a look at the frequencies these
cards are running at Vega 64 impressed
me by remaining quite stable up to 1792
megahertz this actually gave me a lot of
hope for future third-party designs as
well as water cooling options but
balancing high frequencies with power
draw will continue to be a challenge for
this GPU so now that my initial round of
Vega testing is complete I think I have
a pretty good handle on the performance
expectations of people should have the
Vegas 56 is a very nice counter to the
gtx 1070 I'll be in a bit late
while the Vega 64 faces a tougher
challenge against the GTX 1080 in pretty
much every test I ran apart from civics
and a couple of those synthetics the
Vega 64 falls behind the GTX 1080 that's
even while overclocked and while drawing
more power to push fewer frames if I
look at silver linings though I think
there are a few things that should be
pointed out first off monitors there's a
ton of free sync monitors that are way
more affordable than Nvidia g-sync
alternatives and now that they've
actually
some good GPUs that can actually push
frame rates on them like this asus
mg279q by 1440 hundred and forty four
hertz IPS retakes monitor video coming
soon and there is also some next-level
technology built into these cards so
check the description for some links to
full articles that goes over stuff like
the high bandwidth cache controller
empire savings features that can keep a
Vega running cool and quiet 24/7 if
you're willing to give up a little
performance there's also the fine wine
thing the idea that AMD GPUs tend to
gain more performance over time as they
age and drivers mature which is worth a
mention I suppose but I hesitate to call
that a selling point speculative and
more not sure is going to happen this
generation as well ultimately there's a
niche audience of free sync monitor
having closed headphone wearing gamers
who live in temperate climates with
excess chief renewable electricity who
are really really excited that Vegas
finally out and for the rest of us the
Vegas 56 is a very nice alternative to
the GTX 970 and I'm sure we're going to
hear more from Vegas 64 when third-party
designs launch so thank you guys so much
