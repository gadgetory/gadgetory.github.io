box arrived and it was the new Intel
Core i7 69 50 X there ten core twenty
thread newest and fastest consumer grade
CPU that they have ever produced it is
part of the Broadwell II family it's
built on the 14 nanometer lithography
and there are actually four new CPUs in
this family but I'm going to be
concentrating on the 69 50 X today more
on the other CPUs in just a little bit
speaking of everything else I was
delivered the CPU with probably about 48
hours between when I got it and when I'm
leaving for Computex so I spent a lot of
time last night running some benchmarks
and to speed things up I'm going to jump
right into the benchmarks then we'll
talk about some more of the features and
technology okay one spec you should keep
in mind as we look at benchmarks is the
price the bulk price is one thousand
seven hundred and twenty three dollars
which means it's probably going to
retail for more than that 1750 to 1807
in mind but I'm going to be comparing
this to the 59 60 X and the only 59 60 X
that I have is back in the arctic
panther back there now I wanted to run
it at stock speed to give a more apples
to apples comparison but our key Panther
just wouldn't let me under clock it it's
it's it wouldn't let me I tried so as a
result you'll be seen the six 950 X at
stock you also be seen the 69 50 X
overclocked to 4.3 gigahertz across all
10 cores that's about a 43% overclock I
did try for 4.5 like the Arctic Panther
is but it just wouldn't hold it even 4.4
was a bit unstable so I stuck with 4.3
and to proceed with the benchmarking I
set up a mini little testbed here now if
you thinking of a video I posted just a
few days ago that where I built a brand
new test bed with the next 99
motherboard you're like Paul why didn't
you use that well the weird thing about
when I film this and when I film that is
I haven't done that yet you've seen that
but I haven't done it it's weird
anyway time time is timey wimey but this
is a test that I'm using for these
specific tests and I'll be using that
test bed that I built when I get back
from Computex but this is based on the X
99 a gaming Pro carbon motherboard from
MSI very similar to the godlike but much
less expensive thank God it's also got
the Plextor m6e SSD in there just to
give us some high speed fast storage
g.skill trident z their new series of
memory i have the black and white
version here too
in different colors this is actually the
3200 speed rated memory kit although I
was running it at 2666 to match the
speed of the arctic panther at least
when it was overclocked when I was
running stock it was just running at
2133 I have the enter max II TST 40 CPU
cooler in black with the sides gentle
typhoon fan on top and then of course I
have power supply in my EVGA supernova
750g to 80 plus gold rated power supply
to get everything power now I'm not
really doing much on the GPU side here
but I did pop in the NVIDIA GeForce GTX
1080 just so it could be there and look
pretty after thinking about this
platform x99 LGA 2011 - 3 socket you
probably going to do some heavy lifting
with it so I'm going to start off with
some video benchmarks specifically
rendering video in Adobe Premiere
Creative Cloud this is rendering out 4k
footage in h.264 format and I was
actually pretty surprised at arctic
panther with its overclock managed to
beat the 69 50x at its stock frequency
now granted this a pretty wide variance
there because the 69 50 X when it's
running on all cores it can't even get
to its turbo boost 3.5 that's only if
it's running on a single core so I was
running at 3 gigahertz most of the time
so that shows where the Arctic Panther
had the advantage when overclocked
though the 69 50 X really started to
tear through the render got the timed
out at 2 minutes and 47 seconds a 19%
improvement over the stock frequency
next up is handbrake I was using this to
transcode or take 4k video and render it
down to 1080 format so you can take
something and put it on a cell phone for
example and here again we saw the Arctic
Panther beat out the 69 50 X when it was
running at stock speed in fact 16 m50x
performance here was a little bit
disappointing but again I'm comparing it
to a very heavily overclocked 59 60 X
again when overclocked the 69 50 X
really started to show its strength and
performance and it got that render time
cut more than in half down to 3 minutes
and 6 seconds and 53 percent
improvements and of course handily
meeting Arctic Panther at that point
next up is Cinebench this is more of a
synthetic benchmark but I ran this in
both it's multi-threaded mode as well as
single threaded mode in multi-threaded
mode with all 10 cores and 20 threads
going the 6950 x beat arctic panther
even at the stock frequency just running
at 3 gigahertz and when it was
overclocked Wow very nice
it's improvement indeed jumped up to 21
97 on the score a 24% improvement and
then switched over the single thread
this was run very quickly but I wanted
to try to get a bit of a direct
performance single thread to single
thread and broad while he definitely
provides some single threaded
performance improvements we had a ten
point six improvement going from the
standard clock to the overclock on the
69 50 X and if you compare the 59 60 X
on our Panther overclocked to the 69 50
X overclocked it's a 31% improvement and
that's not even running at the same
frequency after that we tried out
blender this is a flying squirrel 3d
rendering job that it runs through
fairly quickly only takes about 20 to 25
seconds and again here we saw the same
story the 6950 exit stock can't beat the
overclocked 59 60 X but again when
overclocked we saw a very nice
performance improvement jump down
beneath the 20-second mark and I gave 21
percent improvement over the stock
frequency not only here's a side-by-side
comparison of the i-264 cache and memory
suite we saw a pretty nice performance
improvement when it comes to memory
write speeds as well as a drop in
latency other than that those scores are
pretty much the same so hope you guys
enjoyed those benchmarks I have a couple
more stats to share as far as power draw
goes this imp title get up here was
drawing just shy of 200 watts when it
was at stock frequency when I
overclocked though it jumped up the
power drop pretty significantly it went
up to about 330 to 340 so it was a good
130 hundred 40 watt additional power
drop again talking about peak power draw
overall as far as temperatures go though
again at stock really really low
temperatures I mean I don't know if that
was our Animax
cooler here or just the fact that the
six and m50x Broadwell EES pretty
efficient but only peaked at about 47
degrees Celsius which isn't too bad at
all again when overclocked that's going
to draw more power create more heat so
it got all the way up to about 80 L
didn't get too much beyond that when I
did attempt the 4.4 gigahertz overclock
it was actually drawing about 1.45 volts
which is more than you'd want on the CPU
so it did get well above 90 there I
think I actually hit TDP max but
fortunately dialing that back a little
bit and running at about 1.3 9 volts is
what I was doing for the 4.3 gigahertz
overclock was pretty
stable and I didn't have too many issues
a few more stats for the 69 50 X you
have 25 megabytes of shared cache and it
is very fast shared cache if you checked
out the ID 64 benchmarks
it also has 140 watt TDP so it's
sticking with the same TDP as the 59 60
X and a nice addition for the broad well
a family is it gives you native
Thunderbolt 3 support that's 40
gigabytes per second bi-directional
bandwidth so for those of you external
storage hogs Thunderbolt 3 is the way to
go now let's take a look at some of the
specs and details for all of the CPUs
and the new Broadwell II launch lineup
we have of course the 69 50 exit at the
top also the 69 hundred K which is kind
of taken the place as a 59 60 X more so
since it's a little 8 core 16 thread and
costs around a thousand or eleven
hundred dollars the 68 50 K is going to
be your six quartz well thread still has
all 40 PCI Express Lanes and that's
going to be kind of your 59 30 K
replacement and then finally we also
have the 6800 K for the folks who are
just trying to get onto this platform
you are cut down to 28 PCIe lanes again
which is very similar to the 5820k that
we saw from last generation base clocks
are only low 3 gigahertz range and
boosts clocks will go up to 3.5 on the
69 50 X 3.7 on the 69 hundred K and by
remind those are single core overclocked
numbers so if you really want the
maximum performance out of these you got
to take advantage of the fact that they
are unlocked
use your overclocking techniques to get
all of the cores running at higher
frequencies and especially on
multi-threaded applications you'll see a
big performance improvement as for cash
you get 25 megabytes on the 6 950 X 20
on the 69 hundred K 15 on the 68 50k and
also 15 on the 6800 K one last thing
here is that the ddr4 standard has been
bumped up a little bit so the standard
for these CPUs I don't like my system
just went to sleep here that's okay
I'll wake it back up later the standard
for these CPUs though is ddr4 2400 of
course they can still run at 2133 just
fine but that is you know nice little
bump finally the pricing and this is
probably the biggest sticking point for
most people again that 69 hundred K
really taking the place of the the 59 60
X when it comes to the price layout and
really gonna have to pay a significant
premium if you want that ten core CPU
one thousand seven hundred and twenty
three dollars and that's if you buy a
thousand of them if you're buying them
individually my guess is 1750 to $1,800
each for the 69 PDX
a couple more features to round things
out we have an AV X ratio offset that
allows the CPU to run at a slightly
under clock frequency if it's detects
it's running an AV x AV X instruction
sets since they can be finicky they've
also added VCC you voltage control for
you higher-end overclockers out there
and finally a pretty exciting feature
called turbo boost max 3.0 not Turbo
Boost 2.0 still works and turbo boost
frequencies I've been talking about
still apply to that turbo boost max 3.0
is basically specific to a single thread
at CPU overclocking so they want to give
the Broadwell a family of processors
more bang for the buck I suppose
especially when you're talking about non
multi-threaded applications so it will
actually detect which core and the CPU
can run the fastest and it can assign
that core specifically to run a single
application and there's a little
application you can go to set it up and
do everything again I have is limited on
time so I didn't get to do too much with
that but it does exist and I'm sure
there's going to be a lot of pretty cool
tests with that coming out very soon
let's do a bit of a conclusion here the
pros about the 6950 Xserve hopefully
obviously it's insanely fast it's very
very fast it's without a doubt the
fastest CPU at the consumer level that
intel has ever given us access to it's
also pretty power efficient from what I
can tell I liked the low temperatures
when it was running at stock speed
specifically also doesn't seem to be too
bad of an overclock or granted I'm using
very limited sample size since they only
have the single CPU but 4.3 gigahertz
across all 10 cores that's pretty
impressive
also quickly mention that turbo boost
max 3.0 technology since it just kind of
seems to make sense especially for a
massive multi-core CPU kind of like this
again I didn't get to test that directly
but assuming it works like they're
saying it does seem like a pretty cool
feature as far as cons go well it's
really really expensive like
out of the ballpark of most people
$1,000 is out of the range for most
people building a system but there are
going to be enthusiasts and people who
have to have the best of the best and
people who just have a little bit more
money in their pocket who are going to
be able to buy this processor but for a
lot of people it's just going to be
watching videos like this that gives you
a little bit of a taste of the
performance so I hope I have provided
you guys with a little bit of that today
the only other con I could think I was
like I don't know maybe there could have
been some other fancy amazing technology
I mean the turbo boost max 3.0 is kind
of cool but I know if it suddenly had
more PCIe lanes or something like that
that might have been cool but maybe
that's hard to implement since they're
still using the same x99 chipset the
same LGA 2011 - 3 socket so you do have
the backwards compatibility with
existing motherboards as long as you get
a BIOS update for them or the entire
range of new motherboards as you may
have noticed a lot of motherboard
manufacturers are coming out with new
motherboards right now but that is all
for this video guys I really hope you
have enjoyed it I'm Paul with Paul's
hardware and hit the thumbs up button if
you liked this video leave me a comment
down in the comment section below and
let me know what you think of this
processor let me know if you're going to
buy one if any of you guys like yes I
don't care what cost get one right when
it comes out thanks again for watching
guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
