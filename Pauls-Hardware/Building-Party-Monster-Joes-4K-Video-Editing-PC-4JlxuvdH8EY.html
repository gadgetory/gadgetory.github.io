a build video for you guys today and
this one is kind of unplanned because my
editor Joe hit me up and basically
editing videos for me over a long period
of time has given him the I must build a
computer bug like right now so he bought
some parts I have some parts also that
I'm going to provide to him and then we
also have his old system that he has
been using to build computers so we're
going to take a look at his old system
and then we're gonna like upgrade it to
a new system specifically for Joe to
edit videos and 4k and stuff I'm going
to call this new series configure my
system by the way there's Joe hey Joe
he's going to be editing this video on
this computer that hasn't even been
built yet which is kind of a weird like
that's like looking into the future
right now so this computer here is
actually a computer that I built several
years ago it's had several different
revisions it uses a 39 60 X for the CPU
at the middle so it's an X 79
motherboard from gigabytes it's got I
believe 32 gigs of memory in it right
now and it's got a couple different SSDs
this is an OC z Revo Drive SSD right
here there's also a OCZ vector 240 gig
SSD that's right there and then Joe also
has a mechanical drive there for
long-term storage and that kind of thing
there's a GTX 670 for the graphics card
and we're using that with CUDA
acceleration for Adobe Premiere to you
know make sure that the overlays and
special effects and everything we're
good now why isn't Joe satisfied with
this computer that's a good question
you guys might look at this computer and
be like this is an awesome computer I'd
be super happy with it but Joe was like
no it sucks I need a better one
that's not exactly what he said but Joe
why do you need a better computer than
this mainly for After Effects okay so
Joe's does After Effects and After
Effects just eats up memory right that
and also want to edit a 4k and editing
at 4k so maybe maybe Paul will actually
have 4k videos on his channel now and
Joe does that other work for other
people too should that should go without
saying so anyway we're going to move Joe
up to X 99
and we're also going to Joe up to a
5820k this is the processor right here
and this is actually an engineering
sample processor I'm going to be lending
Joe this for the time being and that's
going to go along with the gigabyte x99
g1 gaming motherboard this is their
retail box they've kind of gobbled with
a little bit more of a minimalist look
for their retail box this time around
gigabyte but it's okay there it is okay
so the x99 ultra gaming not although it
does say g1 game that's confusing
I'm confused a good bite anyway it's a
very nice x99 motherboard that is the
point so I recommended that he gets a 64
gig kit because he wanted a hundred and
twenty eight gigs at first and then he
actually realized that the 5820k doesn't
support a hundred twenty eight gigs
which I didn't realize although I
probably would have figured it out
eventually anyway back to the point
which is this is a lot of memory and
only four sticks so 16 gigs per dim and
it's only going to use four of the eight
memory slots so if Joe decides in the
future he wants to upgrade and make this
an even more beastly system for editing
he can by simply swapping that 5820k for
a Broadwell e CPU like a 6800 or 68 50k
or heck even a 69 50 X if you can find
someone to murder and steal theirs
because who wants to spend $700 on one
of those and then he could of course
upgrade his memory as well to get up 228
gigs but we'll see how 64 gigs works for
now for the rest of the parts we are
going to upgrade the case so we have a
corsair 540 here if you guys were
disappointed that i didn't build the
monthly build in the course area 540 if
you're not we're going to have a build
on that right now replacing a corsair
case with a corsair case this is the 600
t which is also some of the carbide
series this one I was like it's this
one's quite old now though like it has a
pass-through for the USB 3 and that kind
of thing this will be a good case though
a nice upgrade from the 600 T and some
nice new features there for a graphics
card we got the ZOTAC GeForce GTX 1070
less expensive than the GTX 1080 almost
as many cuda cores and as long as you go
and edit the text file and Adobe
Premiere Pro or of Adobe Premiere CC or
whatever you can still use the gtx 1070
cuda acceleration while you're editing
which is nice we have a 80 plus gold
power supply Thermaltake v PSG 750 watt
again getting the job done so I got
pretty decent cables mostly I'll black
and everything a couple red plugs but
we're actually going to be reusing Joe's
air cooler in here this is probably the
most dubious part of this build only
because I've never heard of this before
Joe found this and installed it himself
because there was a closed loop cooler
in the system before that started
failing so Joe did a great job with this
and I'm you know it's been working fine
for now and it's got support for the LGA
2011 and 2011 - 3 socket so we're just
going to keep using it and you know if
it doesn't work well upgraded in the
future and finally for storage this is
the corsair Neutron XT this is a 480
given model so this is going to be the
operating system drive and it's going to
have plenty of storage for SSD space Joe
wanted a drive for the operating system
and applications that's what this is
going to be he's also going to keep
using that OCZ vector SSD 240 in there
and that will be for storing raw data
and then we're going to keep using the
Revo drive PCIe as well and that will be
a cache drive so anyway that's enough
talking about the build let's build the
built array yay we pulled this off of
Joe's old build now we know using too
much thermal paste is is not bad but
it's not the best item it's I like how
it's hanging down it's got the strings
given the old full processor out of
there good old 39 60 X set Berks girls
lined up yeah right
it's pretty good to me I didn't even
have time to say something scary and
what goes next this yeah there's an
inside one and an outside one and I
didn't want you to lift them up so hey
what wait
cringe factor I could just read the
comments already Jesus Christ that's all
right Joe I don't know how to do this a
day um okay so do this one first no no
no not that one this one first the one
the one that put that clamps that side
down yeah as what I was doing
see that was right I was shining it easy
does this Popoff it should you just lift
it okay
if you is installed
so wait oh yeah what colour should be
black so you're gonna do four slots
basically this one that one that one in
that nook and this does not have a latch
on that side so it just is straight yeah
yeah all right we're gonna laugh at
myself
sad flirting experience ASA started that
trend tonight just one snap
hey good yes let's play
Danah strings keeps coming out this is
the top that's beautiful myself that's
kind of like art bird okay you should
use After Effects to make that blob come
to life that goes down on top are you
touched it flush it
area
like I want to make a nipple joke I
don't want it just weakens she's got to
give him equal time that's the main
thing
always one gets jealous there's I think
yeah when I got this fan was wanted to
get the tip to 12 vibrant favorite youth
will ya closet cooler master yeah but I
didn't have this I got this guy I didn't
know anything about this plastic things
so it works but it's got nice cool
rubber fan mounts for 120 millimeter fan
it does have direct contact copper heat
pipes down at the bottom so this is
definitely PC cooler whatever company
this is I don't know where they're based
or anything but it's certainly a hyper
tooth well you know equivalent or
knockoff or however you want to say that
not quite as nice put it this have a
metal mounting on the base and
everything that this fan mount system is
definitely not that great
using these rubber things I mean
considering the hyper 212 they don't use
anything too much more fancy these
little little metal wires that aren't
that expensive but gotta cut costs
here's the trick here's the real trick
to case opening is these finger flaps
right here a because people therefore
teri yeah these will really mess you up
trying to open the case you got to reach
in here and pull that out like that
so do that to the other side too now
just lift that up top okay set that to
the side now you're about to get shocked
you will always get shocked right now by
the case I find the best way to do it is
to just take my my elbow right and just
touch your elbow right there or your pan
it's lack they supposed to do work just
sorry so we don't see color here falls
over
snaps in Lock and Load so Joe is using a
sharpie to mark the i/o shields because
we ran into a little bit of a dilemma
this is a white box motherboard from
gigabyte came with no accessories at all
which meant no i/o shield fortunately
though I do have the sister board to the
g1 gaming or the game gaming ultra which
is right over here the ultra durable
what does I don't even know this is the
x99 designate of course of course it is
which has a nearly identical rear i/o
panel and I am not using i/o shield
right now there's just a single USB port
that is blocked it's that red one right
there the display port in is now going
to be the USB type-c still access to
that so cut that out and everything will
be fine oh good
wana snaps let's it gets out a little
bit of time so this is how you build a
computer right yeah this is a pretty
standard procedure step in the computer
building process okay
the hack pack sublet so multiply the i/o
shield doesn't sound horrible at all hey
it's kind of man damn
isn't there like a you can't even tell
it's not the right eye oh she oh that's
perfect all right
lined up time for screws
I have a real color scheme in mind it's
perfect it's red black and white looks
beautiful
you know accent oh look at that back
clipping you know to my Bexley alright
the build has been assembled and looks
pretty good and Joe's doing the first
time power on yay
it appears to work sweet oh those leds
leds everywhere red and yellow and blue
beautiful beautiful
what's wrong Paul that's the problem
I don't know turns out an op though I've
seen first part slightly relieved
because we're not getting a video signal
yeah nobody so you guys missed sort of a
brief interlude we went and had dinner
and we had to take a break
cuz we came across a dilemma which was
that we had no video out when we got the
system all up and running I think what
it actually was was a bios issue on this
motherboard I ended up doing the
gigabytes q-flash plus I believe is what
it's called to update the BIOS via just
the USB Drive plugged into the back of
the system this is very similar to the
Asus USB BIOS flash back feature that
was able to update the bounce to the
latest version we were still not getting
any video out of the graphics card in
this slot I actually moved it to the
fourth slot or the third yeah fourth
slot down here and then I was able to
get video out and then we saw that was
trying to do a BIOS rebuild which we
might have i I'll take responsibility I
might have restarted in the middle of a
couple times anyway
after moving it there we were able to
get a video signal the BIOS updated and
then we switched the graphics card back
to the slot and now works so we're good
Windows is installed and Joe is very
excited cuz he was starting to get sad
that he wasn't going to be able to take
his computer home today did only a
little lonely I know that would be so
sad so any guys Windows is installed we
were going to do some like fancy end of
the video shots of this system and
everything but honestly it is getting
late and we're both tired so we'll leave
you with this it looks pretty nice it's
red and black and also blue and also
some yellow the colour scheme and this
is a little bit it's kind of friendly I
think it's very it's got a party
atmosphere going on inside oh but we've
also reconnected the extra drive so he's
booting off of that 240 gig Drive
there's a 480 gig SSD so 2 SSDs that are
in the back on the other side 3 terabyte
drive is now installed down here via the
backplane I like that thank you for ser
for installing that little feature and
then also the Revo drive although this
sup or the driver still needs to be
installed for that so Joe
time for you to edit this video oh hey
hey suppose I pull off a fasting for the
oh yeah let's do that let's do that
it's glorious
you guys are welcome
all right guys hit the thumbs-up button
thanks for watching hope you enjoyed
subscribe if you liked and want to see
