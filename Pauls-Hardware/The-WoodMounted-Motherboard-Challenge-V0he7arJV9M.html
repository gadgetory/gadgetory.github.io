that went on last week I thought for
today's video I want to do something
that's more towards to build side of
things and if I'm being honest with
myself there's a build project that I
have neglected neglected longer than any
other that is my htpc project but I have
good reason for that one is of course as
waiting for Eisen 3000 series to launch
which has been my plan the entire time
ever since I first put together and
second I have a logistical problem to
deal with I have this very nice piece of
walnut that I purchased that has been
stained and sanded I'm still got a
little bit more work to do on that but
I'm gonna be mounting PC hardware a
motherboard and some other parts
directly to that wood and I need to find
a good solution to do that so today's
video is all about how to mount a
motherboard to wood so I'm hoping this
video will come in handy for anyone who
wants to do a DIY project and needs to
mount electronics specifically a
motherboard to a piece of wood for that
purpose I have some standoffs and some
other hardware here that I have sort of
been accumulating let's take a quick
look at that so first off here I have a
test piece of wood this is just some
plywood it's also birch plywood actually
some scrap wood leftover from the
project I did where I built to stand for
Riptide so I'm going to be doing some
testing on one side of this and then I
actually hopefully get the motherboard
mounted to this later on in the video I
have some scrap pieces here to put under
that since I'm just gonna be drilling
right here and I don't want to drill
into my table that I have I have a few
kits of gear here and these I'll put
links to in the description in case
you're interested this is just a set of
motherboard standoffs these all have m3
threading and they are of various
heights so you have like standoff nuts
here you have more typical style m3 nuts
I have some longer standoffs these are
probably going to be the ones that I
attempt to use then I have some screws
which will hopefully not the motherboard
to the standoffs once the standoffs are
match it to the wood I have a few
methods I've researched to do that
properly but one that I'm going to be
attempting is to not use any adhesive or
glue or anything like that so these are
called tap bits it's a drill bit on one
side but then it goes into threading
right there so I might be able to use
this to drill an m3 threaded hole into
the wood and then just take the stand
off and thread it into that hole so
that'd probably be the simplest solution
but I'm not a hundred percent confident
in it just because I'm not sure how well
these m3 threaded standoffs are going to
grip the wood after I use
that bit on it there are other options
you could for example drill all the way
through the wood and put a nut on the
back but the walnut I'm working with
this very thick so I'm probably not
going to be able to do that so my second
option is going to be to mount something
into the wood that they stand off can
then drill into I could possibly use
these nuts just to hammer something down
into it I could drill holes and then use
epoxy so I do have some epoxy here some
gorilla epoxy and then I can maybe glue
them into the holes to make them set a
lot more and make it more sturdy since
I'm planning to make this a vertical
mount but if I had to take a guess at
what's going to be the most effective
mounting method I have these other
standoffs here that are actually
threaded on both sides and I think I'm
just going to sort of drill a small hole
and then pound these into the wood to
get them set possibly use some epoxy and
then I can just mount the standoffs into
that so with the tap method the nuts the
standoffs the epoxy are not epoxy I
should have maybe three to five
different mounting methods I'm going to
attempt then I'll pick the best one and
do a setup to mount this little mini ITX
motherboard to the wood the only other
thing I wanted to mention here is that
most motherboards are grounded through
the ATX power plug but most motherboards
also get additional grounding points via
their mounting holes so one thing I
might actually also do once I get this
mounted to the wood or once I move on to
the HTPC wood mounting is add an extra
little grounding cable here a wire and
connect that up to the power supply to
provide an additional grounding point
it's not a huge deal and you can run
without that just by the ground in the
ATX but I wanted to bring it up as a
potential issue for anyone who might be
trying to do something like this at home
the only other thing I guess I should
mention is that I'm also using a drill
for this drills probably gonna be an sa
here's my first attempt using the tap
bit I'm just gonna try to go vertical
straight up and down as much as possible
that actually worked really well hey
that's the tab bit version and wow that
did a lot better than I thought I
thought the wood was gonna get all tore
up and it wasn't gonna hold very well
man do I even need to do the other
versions yes I will I'll still still do
the next recommendation I read online
was to take a nut that you already know
has a threading for your stand off and
basically set it into the wood either by
hammering it in or setting it in with
epoxy so I'm gonna try to drill a hole
big enough that the net will sit into
and then we'll see whether we think
epoxy is worth attempting that's
probably too big can at least get the
idea if the nuts were set down in the
wood and then that would drill into the
nuts like so option 3 here is going to
be to sink this standoff into the wood
so for that I'm just using a drill bit
that is slightly smaller than the
standoff itself that's eleven sixty
fourths of an inch for those of you who
are measuring in freedom units and I'm
gonna see how sturdy that is and then
we'll see if we want to try epoxy along
with either of these methods Wow that
might be a winner right there so that
was actually pretty quick and both the
tap bit and the inset standoff method
have proven very effective at least in
this initial go at it they seemed very
sturdy they're staying in there I'm
leaning towards the inset standoff
method myself but I wanted to give the
nuts method a bit more of a better shot
and we've got this epoxy here anyway so
I'm gonna mix up some epoxy put that
down into the hole so that it can hold
the nuts in place and then we can mount
the standoff to it just to see how that
goes in the meantime I think I'm gonna
go with one of the other ones just to
get the motherboard mounting going but
for this we have a little mixing tray
for our epoxy and a little applicator
into the hole
that's either I screw it in now and then
the whole thing sealed in there or I try
to screw it in later and it probably
doesn't screw in because there's epoxy
in the way so let's just screw it in
then so I've just mounted this
motherboard I used the tap bits one
thing to keep in mind for the tap bit is
I was trying to do it as vertical as
possible you want to go directly in and
back it out as well when you get down to
the depth he wants definitely switch to
reverse and slowly reverse out of the
hole that you have just made other than
that just keeping things slow and steady
I think is the key because you really
don't want the threading that you were
creating in the piece of wood to get
messed up in any way using that method
though I have now mounted this
motherboard right here and I would say
this is this is very sturdy look at that
that's that's pretty sturdy there so to
assess my three methods the tap bit
method I think is very effective at
least if you have reasonably hard wood
that you're screwing into all you need
is the tap bits and then your stand off
and you're pretty much good to go I
could see that potentially not working
out long-term or if the wood was in an
area where it might get moist or
anything like that or if you had a lot
of weight attached to it then you might
be a little bit less confident in that
method what I think I'm gonna do is the
inset standoff method so I have the
standoffs that just have holes on both
ends drill a smaller hole and set that
directly into the wood by hammering into
place the hex shape of the standoffs
themselves helps to keep it wedged into
the hole and I think this is just my my
sturdiest method and it didn't use any
epoxy or adhesives or anything like that
and it gives you the benefit of being
able to just unscrew the stand off if
you really new need to and then you can
drop it and lose it forever the method
with the nuts works but I was definitely
hit a dilemma where to get the nuts in
there and set in place I had to use a
standoff screwed in to hold it and then
I wanted to unscrew the stand-up but
then I was really concerned that the
epoxy was going to keep me from being
able to screw the standoff back in so
the standoff is still in there yes this
is very sturdy and I think it's probably
just as sturdy as the inset standoff
method and it probably last you forever
but it's definitely a bit messier since
you have to work with epoxy and just
something that is probably going to be
situationally helpful for some people
but I would veera way from that
that if you wanted to be really really
sure I think it would be to use the in
sets standoff method and maybe just put
the tiniest bit of epoxy down at the
bottom to give it a little bit better
grip and make sure it's never going to
come out of that hole but that's what
I'm going to be using for now I've got
this motherboard mounted just with the
tap bit screws and once again I would be
confident with that for long-term use in
just about any scenario I think so guys
let me know in the comment section down
below what you think of my mounting a
motherboard to would methodology that I
have shared today did you think it was
useful you have better ideas for how it
could be done more better let me know
those down in the comment section down
below and let me know if you have any
plans to do like a DIY PC build of some
sort using non traditional case or
mounting methods because I am definitely
gonna be applying this to the HTTP C
build very soon I promise
so thanks again for watching this video
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you enjoyed it and we'll see you guys
