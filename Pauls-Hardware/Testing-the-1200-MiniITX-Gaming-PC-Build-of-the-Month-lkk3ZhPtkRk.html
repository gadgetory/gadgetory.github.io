so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
how's it going and welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is my follow-up
to my monthly build series every month i
part out some builds at the beginning of
the month for people who aren't familiar
with putting computers together and then
I build one of the system's and then I
test it later on so this is the testing
video for this 1200 ish dollar mini ITX
system it's meant to be small it's meant
to be powerful it's meant to be able to
play video games of course but also do
games streaming video editing since you
have an 8 core processor in there as
well as a gtx 1070 but if you go back to
the original planning video i also
pointed out how you could easily drop in
a 1070 TI or a 1080 even depending on
the prices that are available now one
quick note about this system as it is
put together and being tested here is
that I actually use the 2700 X CPU in
here now there's four or five different
eight core processors available on the
am 4 platform from AMD Rison first gen
as well as resin second gen I went with
2nd gen because we have a be 450
motherboard in here
but just so you guys know if you're
going for one of those other eight core
processors you probably will need to
overclock it a little bit in order to
achieve the exact same results that I'm
gonna show you guys today
but overclocking thankfully is possible
with B 415 motherboards as well as this
motherboard that I have right here after
that build completion video that you
guys maybe have already seen I had to do
a little bit of setup of course some
stuff like you know plugging in things
where necessary in the power I have
wired up the 802 dot eleven AC Wi-Fi
here as well the Windows 10 installer
did not recognize the 802 dot 11 AC
Wi-Fi right out of the gate so very mind
you might need to plug in Ethernet or
perhaps jump on to another computer to
go to the gigabyte website to get the
Wi-Fi driver in order to load it up to
get everything working but before I did
all that I did a BIOS update to make
sure I had the latest version of the
bass and then I went through standard
windows 10 installation procedures
updating the drivers and making sure
that all the software was installed the
games were installed and everything was
up to date in the BIOS I did go and set
the XMP setting for the memory
so it's running at ddr4 3000 speed and I
had no problem with stability after that
and I guess I should point out that I
was doing all this testing out in the
dining room and that's simply so I could
have a little bit more control over
temperatures since it is the middle of
the summer here so ambient temperatures
were about 81 degrees Fahrenheit and
that's about 27 degrees Celsius so a
little on the warmer side please bear
that in mind as you're looking at some
of the temperatures for these tests
I am a little bit of a time constraint
so my testing was limited but I think
it'll give you a good idea of the
performance you can expect the first
test I ran was 3d mark firestrike ultra
this is a synthetic test but it's very
good at showing you the ballpark
performance of your graphics card in
your overall system as well as giving
you a good point of comparison because
there's lots of test results for 3d mark
you can find online overall scores 4590
for graphics score was 44 and 90 and the
physics score was 20,000 564 thanks to
the eight core CPU combined score was
2309 and as the test was running the max
CPU frequency was four point three four
gigahertz that's just on one core and
that's thanks to XF r2 which will
automatically overclock one or two cores
on your processor as long as
temperatures are within a reasonable
range i've found that xf r NX f r2 can
often get one or two cores to a higher
frequency then you'll be able to achieve
if you're just doing manual overclocking
especially if you're trying to go for an
all core overclock so often with gaming
performance it's better to just leave
settings as is in the BIOS rather than
going and overclocking yourself that
said if you're running one of the
cheaper eight core processors like a
1700 definitely worth your while to go
over and dabble with overclocking just a
bit the max CPU temperature was 71
degrees for this test and the GPU temp
was 75 so that's getting a little bit
warmer but this is a shorter test the
GPU overclocked by the way I was running
at nineteen sixty one megahertz and that
is because this is a manufacturer
overclocked msi gtx 1070 next test is 3d
mark times pi this is also a synthetic
but it is direct x12 overall score of
six thousand four hundred and sixty six
graphics score of sixty two hundred and
a cpu score of eight thousand five
hundred and fifty-one same max CPU
frequency here hitting four point three
four gigahertz on one or two cores and
then the CPU dive temperature got up to
eighty one degrees Celsius and the max
GPU temperature went up to eighty one
degrees Celsius as well times pi is a
longer test so it gave the components
more time to heat
and since I wasn't doing a full stress
test on this with like a CPU and GPU
load as thick and you know what that's a
little bit too warm for my taste
so I decided at this point to do a
slight modification to the original
build and just install a second 120
millimeter intake fan up at the front I
mentioned in the build video that
there's not a lot of room up in the
front with this build because the
graphics card it shows is fairly long so
if you are building this system and you
waited to watch this follow-up video on
the performance I definitely recommend
adding a second fan another 120 at the
front to give yourself just a bit more
airflow and keep things cooler but also
maybe double check your graphics card
again when you purchase it there's lots
of shorter graphics cards even the
founder's edition graphics cards would
be a great solution here because only
ten and a half inches long but consider
something like that to give yourself
more airflow give yourself a better
overall experience with the system and
keep your components a bit cooler
especially if you're in the summer
months when things are warmer when it
comes to the ambient the finance
Tolleson noctua nf8 12 X 15 PWM and that
fortunately was able to tuck right in
there up in front and with that added
and I ran the 3d mark time spy run one
more time Mac CPU temp now was 75 point
five degrees and the max GPA temp was 79
so so about five and a half degrees
cooler on the GPU and about two degrees
cooler on the CPU that's a reasonable
improvements especially considering that
it's a slim fan and I mentioned I was a
little short on time for this testing
but I didn't manage to get a run of GTA
5 in just playing it 1920 by 1080
average frame rate was out of 23 frames
per second one percent low was 79 0.1%
low was 70 the max CPU frequency was
still hitting four point three four
gigahertz in this test and fortunately
with a bit of a more reasonable gaming
load so if you're comparing those times
spy tests and thinking other things are
getting too warm this test is more like
you're actually just playing a game in
here the CPU temperature only got up to
sixty six point three degrees Celsius
GPU temperature was at 73 so we're still
well within our tolerable temperatures
as far as that goes I also want to point
out here that your GPU and CPU in this
system are both designed to clock
themselves higher when temperatures are
lower but also dial that clock speed
down a little bit when things get a
little bit too warm so don't necessarily
consider that oh it's getting too warm
and it's throttling it's simple
adjusting the clock speeds to make sure
things don't overheat but of course if
you are concerned about overheating
there are plenty of additional fan
locations on this case so you can add
more fans evacuate more of that warm air
and give yourself probably a little bit
better performance in the long run
apart from raw performance in temps the
last thing to really test with this
system is going to be noise generation
so here is a quick sound test
so things are staying pretty quiet
overall with the system even under load
and I think that's really what it boils
down to with this build is yes there are
some caveats here in there to keep in
mind stuff about AMD with the rising
platform temperatures but overall
everything fits together really nicely
there's a lot of performance built in
there and of course you got that
expansion capability with the additional
2.5 inch and 3.5 inch drive mounts as
well as the ability to add more fans oh
and I should point out this system does
support a 240 millimeter all-in-one
radiator I would make sure that it is in
the smaller side as those go but I
finally did actually look up the manual
for this on the Rio tour website and it
does confirm that that is a possibility
too so if you weren't stoked on this
cooling situation for the CPU you could
add one of those in the front if you so
desired but guys that wraps it up for
this video again links to this entire
build is down in the video's description
check out the build video and the
planning video as well if you want to
see how it was put together or some
other ideas for parts you might want to
swap in if you want to save some money
there is an $800 version of this bill
that I put together as well thank you
guys so much for watching though the
thumbs up button on your way out
subscribe if you want to see more
content coming at you very soon and
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
