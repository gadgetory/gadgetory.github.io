two-part video that the first half is on
Kyle's channel that you might have
already watched before cell hates stock
coolers like I know this is a pretty
decent rave spell here but he's he's
going to be livid if we put this in his
system dude one time I saw him grab a
guy's balls just for holding one of
these things granted I've seen him grab
a guy's balls for no reason at all but
it was still really disturbing look I
don't care what kind of a fetish cell
has for aftermarket CPU cores I am NOT
going to let it ruin this project get
your shuttle together Oh what year is it
I passed out okay it's some fumes
collected down there something Oh God
so we need a CPU cooler I think I might
have overreacted yeah we are in a garage
full of your hardware's
and who is probably a good chance that I
have the CPU cooler just sit as when
right here Hey all right that works cool
uh moving on problem solved
so guys obviously you should have
watched Kyle's video the first half of
this build we're building a system for
cell processing or a good friend and our
longtime moderator for our live show
that we do on Tuesday evenings at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time which is called
awesome hardware we're just we're trying
to say thank you to sell because he's
been such a good moderator and because
though we think we could use a better
computer and because rise and processors
are really badass and he likes to scream
and stuff sell streams and games and
like a core rise in 1,700 X let's see if
either put in here that sounds a really
good job at the streaming in the gaming
it's also got kind of a poop like it
looks like a little pile of poop it's
the turd method the tiered method of
thermal paste FK pointed myself it helps
tear down his hat before a bunch of
drama struck but you know what
fortunately we've moved past that and it
doesn't matter how badly SEL hates CPU
coolers are like sake he'd sneak fans
he's got a cat his way so we're
upgrading in here we're gonna drop in
the thermal
take contact silence 12 which Kyle is
currently trying to decipher the
destruction for the instruction the
standard destruction the instruction
trying to distract this thing I'm going
to destroy it and most likely first step
oh it's actually having you put the fan
on first that's that's new really yeah
is that that's not takes the fan off mm
no such actually pointing the arrows
towards the heatsink
saying do it I am do it this way curious
interesting very professional a decision
has installed thousands and thousands of
CPU heatsink fans in the past it does
not feel right though I'm strange nope
shut up hold on long been treasuring by
any cpu builders something doesn't feel
right here originating from its native
homelands Thailand
let's racist read the study pointing out
where I'm from is racist you studied for
considered over 50 years to protect this
method
oh it feels really tight so she said
good thing I know I know but sometimes
it can be a little scary when it's too
tight you know you're wondering this
thing too big it's got to drive at home
man we ring it and force it in they
break it comes to tight it's I've done
that before it's it's not pretty
no one no one wins okay just feels I
don't it doesn't feel good sign upside
down no they came for installing yeah
here you you see it fun crazier man
there's no way that will fit like okay I
can see it I can see right here which is
when I push down on down I see what you
mean okay that scary all right so I have
handed over the the CPU cooler to Paul
because I'm just too paranoid to break
it this is the strangest mounting
mechanism I've ever seen you're actually
supposed to bend the metal bracket in
order for the little latches to reach
the built-in mounts on the motherboard
all right and Paul has done it because
he's braver than I am to these two side
pieces right here really flex yeah
which I actually think is a good thing I
mean it takes pressure to put it on but
it's holding this very securely against
the CPU so there should be a good
contact name and Thermaltake needs to
work on there manual just a bit because
there's no indication that you should be
bending the metal from the pictures it
just says pop it on there and it'll it
will do everything on its own but you
can see that Paul's almost nearly
flatted the metal out these metal
brackets here they were about 45 degree
angle and he literally just pushed it
down hard enough on the CPU until it
till it fit but good job Paul thank you
well done we didn't break a CPU I am
professional yes you are
so we have opted to remove this blue LED
fan from the back just it's just not our
favorite look and God knows this cell I
mean if there's one thing that he hates
even even maybe just as much the stock
eating fans it's led fans with clear
clear plastic we're going to drop in one
of these fresh little air flow venturi
fans instead so we weren't a hundred
percent sure where to go with the SSD
there's a chance of it clashing but
honestly doesn't look too bad we have
dropped the graphics card in now so
we've got the red white blue black but
honestly it doesn't look too bad we
decided to go with these glamoured flops
down here there at least one of those
and they're not too difficult to install
just curious unscrewed everything's
coming together though it's looking very
pretty looking nice I think what's
really going to destroy this is putting
in the power supply is to the test
what's next oh my god this is this so
you need cable extensions please please
install cable extensions very soon out
of the frying pan into the fire
cable management proceedings slowly to
the cavity I'm plugging in the CPU
connector pipe in here eight pins I'm
going to be challenging to reach if you
leave it until later on so we enjoy a
challenge we do nothing we can't handle
it looks like we are pretty much done
with this build as far as getting
everything together and functional Cal
is going to act as van and wait for me
here as we show you guys just a quick
look before we hopefully also do a
reveal Purcell if we can we can get him
on the phone or whatever now you'll
notice that our color scheme completely
went to crap as soon as we installed the
power supply down there but it's okay
because again really good power supply
but we lose the color coordination
because obviously you know your PCI
Express cables right here looks horrible
that up there looks horrible but if you
can ignore that you can get out just a
much better appreciation for how nice
this yeah I mean just going to just let
your imagination run wild yeah you cover
that up about see it looks so much
better that's perfect there we go that's
what a beautiful build alright so got
the SSD down in the tray here bear in
mind that this bottom piece here will be
covered when we put the side panel back
on in just a moment and then beyond that
you know you got a pretty standard ATX
size build here to 140 fans in the front
and then again we upgrade that fan in
the back to the fractal venturi airflow
version so I'm pretty stoked we should
turn this on yep you want to take a look
at the back really quick
oh yeah look so let's appreciate our
cable management side look at that
fortunately we have a basement so we
kind of crammed a bunch of stuff in
there yep I'm also in the interest of
time but the case does a pretty good job
of providing some velcro straps to tie
things down so we can sit that side
panel on of course we are encouraging
cell to add some extensions in the near
future yes we are so we didn't want to
lock down things too tightly because he
might be going in there himself in the
near future but looking pretty good all
around all right I've got the fire
switch in the back and we power it on
where is the okay
here we go I'm too short Evan yep hey
beautiful
we have a boot more or less glorious
that we've been all the lights beautiful
pretty lights the board already know
that board LED has already matched the
graphics crap see this ideal it was
meant to be all right cool
okay now that we know that this works
and we also got the blue LED on the
front of it now that we know that we've
at least got an initial power on and
everything seems to be functioning we're
going to try to see if we can
communicate what cell and perhaps do a
dramatic reveal but we don't know if
that's going to happen yet so what if he
just decides today to stop being our
friends that would suck
Oh tuck your hands and dress then mostly
for him though then we'd have to give
this away to like our fans or something
we'll give it to self yeah so guys this
is sell whoo-hoo we've told you a little
bit about he's our moderator and we've
been working a little project that
involves cell and it's right here so
Kyle
fadeaway cell we thought since you've
been such a great moderator and friend
to us for the past few years that we
would build you a little system here so
this is your new system assuming that
you want it we decided to throw some
nice hardware in here including a risin
7 1700 X there's a gigabyte gaming I'm
sorry chorus gaming 5 motherboard in
there that's on the X 370 chipset 16
gigs of ram that's some lpx ddr4 3200 we
also have an RX 580 from power color
it's the red devil golden sample which
should be a nice complement to your
freesync panel and we've also got a 240
gig Toshiba OC z TL 100 SSD in there for
your boot drive and whatnot we swapped
out the ugly blue LED fan that came with
the case with a nice fractal venturi
1:40 and speaking of the case we are
rocking a mastercase pro 6 from good ol
cooler master yeah the one thing that I
will say it upon I we're a little bit
short on are the power supply cables you
might need to get some extensions
because you know we know how you and all
of us feel about ketchup and mustard
unfortunately we didn't have any
extensions on hand so maybe that's a
little bit of a DIY job you can do once
this gets home to you but for the most
part it's a it's a stellar power supply
1200 watt from an tech 80 plus gold
right gold I thank Nestle and all that
jazz so highly power-efficient should be
enough so even if you wanted to throw in
a you know second graphics card and
they're down the line or something like
that but hopefully this pleases you as
much as you have you have pleased us and
I mean that in every interpretation
imaginable we just want to say thanks
for all that you do for us and awesome
hardware and our channels and that we
love you so thank you guys um Wow uh it
wasn't necessary at all guys we not
really wasn't we no we're just we we
felt like it was something we wanted to
do itself we didn't feel obligated to do
it we've wanted to do it for you plus we
think your current computer sucks that's
that's the main thing here yep and it
might just all be a ploy so we can get
your address because we've been trying
to track you down for a long time we
will find you thank you we will find you
eventually and we will kill you but you
know I don't I'm not actually in one
location I'm actually omnipresent right
so bounces around you never know where
he's going to show up next he's off the
grid you know hey well guys okay that's
that's all thank you that's the end of
the video so you're very welcome we're
going to get this to you really quickly
yep and we actually have a live show to
get ready for right now to finish
preparing for us where you get on top of
that yeah Oh actually yeah and by the
way before we close the video so we're
going to need you to work a little
overtime
next week on awesome hardware hopefully
that's cool I mean you know now that you
have this awesome system you can
definitely put in a few more hours to
really make the show what it deserves to
be you know so what that's Coco all
right thanks buddy
thanks ed no matter what they're talking
about they they surprise me with them so
you're like hey we're doing a sketch I
was like I knew something yeah all right

social media and stuff in this video's
description

cow for coming over and helping build
this computer thanks all for all of your
hard work for us and see you later guys
have a good one see you guys bye self</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
