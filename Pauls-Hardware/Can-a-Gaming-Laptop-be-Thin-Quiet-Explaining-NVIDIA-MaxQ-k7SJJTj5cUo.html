to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster hey guys welcome back to my
Computex 2017 coverage I have traveled
over to here to the height where Nvidia
is shacked up because they have a new
thing it's called max cue technology
that they're integrating into their
their notebooks or video doesn't make
notebooks it makes graphics cards but
max q is sort of a collaboration a set
of standards so Nvidia can work with the
notebook manufacturers to make laptops
they can game on with like GTX 10 70s
and 10 80s that are super quiet but
still give you a extremely adequate
gaming experience so the actual
definition of Max Q comes from NASA and
it's their definition of the point at
which the aerodynamic stress on a rocket
in atmospheric flight is maximized so
what is it when it comes to invidious
implementation basically it's kind of
like a new Ultrabook standard but not
from Intel it's a standard from Nvidia
it's to work with laptop manufacturers
to produce 18 to 19 millimeter thick
gaming notebooks that actually have
decent gaming performance and that don't
sound like jet engines under load so
I've got some slides to share with you
guys but I'm going to try not to dwell
on the Nvidia marketing stuff because
they say stuff like up to 70% more
gaming performance and they have graphs
where the y-axis doesn't start at 0 and
I don't like that but what I thought of
when they described this was min maxing
like back in the Diablo or World of
Warcraft days min maxing for notebooks
they're doing it by using every means
possible to improve airflow and cooling
within these 18 millimeters thick
notebooks and that's a pretty tough job
when you're using a full-fat gtx 1070 or
1080 in there it's even more difficult
when you have to meet max-q standards at
Nvidia histep which means it has to stay
below 41 DBA while gaming so very very
quiet the demo notebook that they showed
us for this purpose was the asus
zephyrus that's an rog laptop it's 18
millimeters thick it's got a GTX 1080
inside and 120 Hertz g-sync monitor so
trick one that max Q notebooks will use
is unique cooling solutions and for the
Zephyrus it was a hinged design on the
back of the notebook it opens up the
underside of the laptop when the screen
is open so that allows a lot more
airflow into the GPU the power to
every and other components trick to is
to use high quality power delivery
components and that will pretty much cut
down or minimize waste heat and trick
three is going to be a set of optimized
game settings that you'll be able to
access with GeForce experience Nvidia
says they already have 400 games that
are set up and they're going to be
adding more in the future the idea is to
find that perfect point on the
performance versus power usage scale and
always have the laptop play right there
which sounds like a pretty good idea in
theory and once these laptops actually
get in the hands of reviewers we'll see
how it plays out in practice one final
option from XQ notebooks is whisper mode
and this is an even quieter mode that
reduces power consumption even more for
sub 40 DBA gameplay which means in most
environments with a noise floor above 40
DBA you won't even hear the notebooks at
all for whisper mode they use frame rate
targeting in the 40 to 60 frames per
second range so it's a priority in this
case is on quiet gaming versus
performance
other than that Asus notebook they also
had a cleveo p9 50 which is 19
millimeters thick with a gtx 1070 and an
msi gs70 terse stick with the gtx 1070
i'm going to have max cue gaming
notebooks available from all their major
notebook partner OMS worldwide starting
on June 27th guys it's going to wrap it
up for this video I'd like to thank my
sponsors for Computex
2017 once again MSI EVGA G scale Tesoro
and coolermaster it's thumbs up button
if you enjoyed the video leave me a
comment in the comment section and of
course subscribe if you want to see more
coverage from Computex we'll see you in
the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
