hey guys how's it going welcome to
Paul's hardware I am super excited about
this video I'm super super excited for
today because I have a day of building
and I have a ton of hardware here in
front of me so much so that I was like
barely able to even keep it all just in
this one shot so I can start this video
a video out but this is arctic panther
this is the resurrection the rebuild of
arctic panther with martin modern
hardware and i'm gonna be water cooling
it and this is going to be the part 1
video no no two ways about it this is
definitely going to take more than just
a single video to cover so I'm gonna
start with initial installation start
getting the water cooling stuff set up I
need to start out by saying a huge thank
you to a soos as well as ek ek water
blocks for sponsoring a lot of the parts
for this build and I've already done
enough teasing about this entire project
so I'm gonna get right to it and start
off by going over as quickly as I can
all the parts that I'm going to be
attempting to install in my custom
modded define our 5 so the define our
five from fractal is the standard ATX
case and I'm going to be housing
everything in and again this has been
custom modded starting out when I first
did this initial build in this case a
couple years back I did a tempered glass
side panel window before that was cool
and I also just recently have added a
USB type-c plug to the top for a USB 3.1
gen2 connectivity 10 10 gigabits per
second and that's pretty sweet so
keeping that case modern and up to date
alright so for the core of my system and
probably going to cause the most
controversy is this i7 78 20x CPU
there's plenty of arguments to be made
as to why I should or should not use
this processor but for my purposes I
have two of these right now which means
I can install one into this system and
then I'll still have another one to use
for further testing because it's nice to
have a floater one that I can pop into
another test bed or something like
so that's actually a big reason why I'm
going with this right now also I did
some testing just to see with dual gtx
980ti is what the best solution would be
for getting the most bang for the the
most performance out of them and the
Intel platform does still seem to be the
case right now granted yes there's more
testing to be done and all that stuff
I'm not ruling out swapping the CPU out
at some point in the future but for now
that's what I'm going with it's got
eight cores 16 threads and it is
somewhat limited on PCIe lanes as well
so my 1080p areas are going to be
running it by 16 and by 8 so we'll
hopefully do some testing with that and
see how things play out but this is
going to let me get the system up and
running for now and feel free to argue
in the comments about whether or not
this is an actual good decision and then
I'll also say for anyone who's like oh
you should totally be doing this on
thread refer guys I do have a thread
Ripper water cooled system planned
coming soon so I haven't named that one
yet though so I can't tell you exactly
what that is the motherboard though is
the RG Strix X - 99 - gaming chose this
one because it's a very nice clean
looking motherboard it doesn't have
quite the full black and white aesthetic
like I had with the original x99 deluxe
board that I used an RQ Panther but it
does have a nice subtle somewhat subtle
set of RGB features on it that I can
turn on and off and control the RGB is
going to match up and work with the Asus
Ora software so that's another key
aspect of this this is going to be a
black and white build but my plan is to
be able to engage RGB mode when I want
to and of course as always keep things
classy so for memory I got the G scale
Trident xik it's the standby it's kind
of been the initial foray into RGB
memory and it works really well and it
looks really cool when it's sort of
black white and grey otherwise so it's
still gonna match with everything else
well I'm down here might as well point
out my storage for now I'm just
installing this for storage a one
terabyte ocz Toshiba nvm er D 400 SSD
one terabyte should be plenty for games
and storage and and if I need another
assist I'll probably pop one in there
but for now that's what we're going with
the power supply is another carry over
from the original build and this one you
can't really see it very well right now
but it is custom sleeved I did the
sleeving on this myself as
hours and hours and hours of work into
it it's 80 plus platinum thousand watch
fractal design at Newton power supply
which is perfectly adequate and gets
everything done so I have no reason to
swap this out with anything else also
it's got that nice imprint of the
snowflake on the top which which I think
looks pretty cool for GPUs I have to
Asus GTX 1080 tea ice and these are the
Strix version they're overclocked out of
the box I'm going to overclock a more of
course once I get them water-cooled and
NVIDIA has said they're not launching
anything beyond the 1080i this year so
for the remainder of 2017 this is the
top dog when it comes to at least
practical consumer graphics cards if you
don't have spend well over $1000 for a
Titan Exel P still gives you 11 gigs of
memory gddr5 X memory per card these are
really nice cards they're quiet running
they have custom PCBs designed by asus
and therefore we need specialized water
blocks so those are under here the e KF
C 1080 GTX TI Strix so these are made
specifically for the PCB design of these
Strix graphics cards I should be able to
get those installed today I also have
back plates for those which I ordered
because the ek website tells you those
it required but I'm still very strongly
considering just sticking with what it's
got on there which allows me to have
that RGB ROG logo on the back which I
think looks pretty cool and I don't mind
this back plate for the tricks at all so
we'll see how things play out today and
maybe I'll just leave that on there and
and and pass on the ek ones for now but
speaking of ek stuff that's kind of the
majority of the rest of the things I
have here barring a primo shell product
right there but starting with the
monoblock
really excited about this one the Asus
Strix X $2.99 - a monoblock again it's
designed specifically for this
motherboard in order to provide cooling
for the CPU and also the power delivery
up top there and keeping the power
delivery cool in Ex 299 is a bit of a
challenge depending on what motherboard
manufacturer you speak to so I'm glad to
be water cooling that I've got an ek
x-rays 100 D DC pump and I have a pump
reservoir extension for this to make it
taller take a little bit more space
hopefully look pretty cool
and then I've got ek Vardar Evo fans a
total of six of those so I'm hopeful
gonna be doing three in the top two in
the front one in the bottom down there
may or may not add one more for exhaust
in the back we'll see if I have room I
didn't in the original build for
radiators actually have a thicker one
and a thinner one I've got the slim
addition and the performance addition
here 360 performance addition 240 slim
addition should give you a little bit of
extra room in there and again I'm just
going to kind of play around with that
and see what we're doing as far as space
once those are actually installed for
hard line tubing because this is a hard
line water-cooled build this is PE TG
tubing so I will be doing some bending
with this later on that will probably
come in a second video by the time I get
to that but we'll see how things go
today this is PE TG and this is 12
millimeter inner diameter and 16
millimeter outer diameter so this is the
thicker style of tubing like I used in
hotbox my wife's build that I did last
year so I think it looks pretty cool I
kind of like the thicker tubing you know
I mean it just gets the job done so I've
got effects we got tons of these and I
like the DK wraps them up individually
so that the tubing doesn't get scratched
in transit
there's actually more water cooling
stuff besides what I have here and so
I'll be sort of bringing that out over
time I have a bunch of fittings and
everything I've have the hard line
tubing compression fittings and then I
got a few extra products here like this
one order from primo chill which is a
vortex visual flow indicator I like the
flow indicator so I'm gonna see if I can
pop that in there and get that to work
and then I got a few other extra pieces
of gear that I am gonna be given a shot
at using here so this is an ex SPC
cutter that's specifically made for PE
TG tubing so maybe that'll make the
tubing cutting a little bit easier too
but I'll sort of I mentioned this these
things as I go along for now let's get
to building I'm ready I'm ready to build
let's go
[Laughter]
so step one with any build should be an
outside-of-the-box test I have skipped
that a lot in a lot of my recent builds
but when I'm planning to a water pool
something it's not something that you
can pass up so I've set everything up
out here I'm actually using my stock
heatsink fan or an LGA 2011 and 12 2011
f3 so that's kind of nice and let's give
her the old college try and see how
things work this motherboard doesn't
have a
okay there it is all right new soup you
installed also yes this is the 78 20x
step that was I was pretty sure I do
have I do have an engineering sample
7900 x2 but so cool not a full test but
we got the basic to go in here so I
think we're good to go and move on with
the water cool stuff
so part of the attempt to use the
existing Asus back plates is securing
them on there properly which I can did
for the most part the central screws
that holds the holder Dunne's over the
GPU and over the MOSFETs that still
works it's still functional so those
still tighten through the back here the
main issue is there's there's screw
holes that hold this back plate on which
are accessible from this side which are
blocked by the block once it's on there
and also I seem very limited on the
number of screws I have that actually
work for that and most of the screws
that came out of it are fairly long
they're a little bit lengthier so if I
try to screw that just straight through
the board even if I use a little washer
sticks out the back and doesn't look
very good so I am gonna try to shorten
some of these and just just trim the end
off see how this kids
I'm not sure if I have high hopes or not
this is making me really think that I
should get advice yeah whole screw just
popped off in it not the right tools or
the right method to do something like
this
doing a terrible job
hey you can take him over this
all right k so I kind of promise you
that this was going to be a part one
video and I think we've reached a point
right now where I'm going to cut it off
and say this is the end of part 1 we've
faced some challenges we've overcome
some obstacles the first of course was
just to get the system set up and do a
test boot if you're setting up a
water-cooled system I highly highly
recommend you do that because you do not
want to get all the stuff in there
especially if you're doing a hard line
and then suddenly find out that your
motherboards bad or something like that
so fortunately we had a good test boot
that went pretty well beyond that it was
mainly installing these blocks so the
monoblock went in fairly easily for
installing the mono block we actually
had to poke through the motherboard and
install it with screws on the back and
that's the first time I've done this
high-end desktop motherboard actually
discovered that there's just a basically
sheet of plastic there that you poke
through and then that allows you to get
through and mount from the back but that
installed pretty easily beyond that all
the hardware of course was included in
the ek kit that came with it then
installing the blocks on the graphics
cards and here's where I was doing my
best to see if I could maintain and keep
these back plates that came with asus
strix gtx 980ti s
because they have a nice brushed metal
finish and they also have an RGB logo on
there which I feel like losing that
since it's kind of one of those little
features it comes to the graphics card
was something I was going to see if I
can do with that now the biggest dilemma
there is that you have some screws that
are supposed to screw into the backplate
from this side of the card you have
other screws that are supposed to screw
into the block from this side of the
card and when you use the backplate that
doesn't come with the ek waterblock you
don't have access to all of those screw
points fortunately I had a very very
tiny actual screwdriver bit and I was
able to fit through the tiny hole and
screw in the screws even while screwing
down through the backplate that came
with the 1080i so right now that's
installed I am probably gonna keep it as
is but let me know in the comments what
you guys think it's not a completely
clean installation if you look at it
directly from the side you can see a few
parts where the backplate doesn't
necessarily sit as flush or a straight
as it could but I think it's fairly not
noticeable so if you guys have any
feedback for me on that what you think
should do please go ahead and leave that
in the comment section down below the
next steps are going to be of course
getting the radiators installed in the
front and in the top getting the pump
and reservoir installed and mounted to
the front as well I need to get the
radiators first because the pump is
actually going to install on a bracket
that mounts to that I can then actually
start installing my fittings in various
places like I can probably hear this one
in right now I'm getting distracted
though and then of course getting the
tubing installed bending it getting the
loop figured out I'm also going to
figure out where I'm going to put my
fill port and my drain ports so all that
is coming very soon I know I am NOT as
far as long as I could be so I hope you
guys have liked this part one video hit
the thumbs up button if you did enjoy it
and stay tuned for part two coming out
very soon arc panther is on the way let
me see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
