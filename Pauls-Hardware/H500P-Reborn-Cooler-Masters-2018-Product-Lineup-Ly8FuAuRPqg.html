Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool well
hello everyone I am now over at palms
place at the cooler master suites down
the top floor and that's a lovely view
but we don't have any time for any of
that because coolermaster I think has
more new products than any other place
that I have been so far at CES 2018
let's be honest a lot of it's been a lot
of CS 2018 is sucked there's been
nothing good the cooler master has some
pretty good stuff we're gonna start over
here with the CPU coolers so let's begin
over here with some new clothes loop CPU
coolers and these are specifically made
for rise in Raven Ridge no that one is
that's a rise in Raven Ridge CPU cooler
so cooler masters when working directly
with AMD to develop a cooler for the new
AP use that AMD will be coming out with
very soon which will have Vega and Rison
in the same units this one has an RGB
fan and it's it's small I imagine it
will be somewhat affordable and if you
get an APU you can put that on it and
keep your ap you cool excellent beyond
that we have this new closed-loop cooler
and this one is actually made
specifically for the Red River so this
is a thread ripper socket and to make
sure that they have the best cooling
possible they've paired it with 280
millimeter radiator now you might be
able to see right along the edge here
the actual contact copper plate that
they've made is a little bit bigger to
provide a little bit more contact
surface area with thread Ripper CPUs
which are quite large to provide the
best gluing possible so check them out
the red Ripper this is the master liquid
ML 360 tr4 Edition next up our brand-new
master liquid coolers ml 120 R and 240
are on the left side and these are
updated with new pump design new cap on
here and these all have addressable LEDs
so get eight addressable LEDs and the
fans you get 12 addressable LEDs in the
pump block unit down there as well and
when you take out the lid you can
actually individually see all of the
individually addressable LEDs so this is
a new design and they've also have a pro
version of it the master I'm sorry smart
master liquid ml 240 smart and this one
is updated with an aluminum housing
around
the housing for the pump and in what I
think is a pretty cool effect and a
really good idea if you like LEDs of
course is they've added more addressable
LEDs going up and down the side of the
radiators so if you like RGB LEDs then
this is going to be a great option for
you and definitely something I haven't
really seen before as far as the accent
on the radiator we have a side facing
radiator that's mounted at the top of a
case for example that would actually
look really cool here's the master air G
100m really quickly we actually showed
this back at Computex I'm not going to
dwell on it too much but just it looks
like it looks like a flying saucer for
example and it's got a direct heat
column that's how it affects the cooling
there it's a fun little product this is
a new product over here that I'm
actually kind of excited about this is
the master air ma for 10m we're
expecting this to be about 50 bucks and
it's probably not going to be out until
closer to Computex timeframe but
basically you have an air cooler with a
push-pull configuration RGB LEDs as well
as a really cool looking effect at the
top here they've got the cooler master
halo and then you can look down through
it through many many layers of the RGB
LEDs going all the way down so pretty
cool effects and seems to be also a
relatively affordable air cooling option
that also looks really nice
here's a quick look at the tough gaming
x-series so basically a cooler master
has paired up with Asus and Asus likes
now to put digi camo and yellow accents
on their tough line of motherboards
which makes it a challenging to find you
know proper matching components to go
along with it that cooler master has you
covered they have a tough series version
of the envy 500 case as well as tough
series matching cooler in there and so
if you have a tough motherboard from
Asus you should buy all this stuff
oh there's also a power supply I'll show
you in a second next up is aq 300 and we
actually showed this off a little bit at
Computex but it's actually becoming
available now and these are going to be
very affordable in the 50 to 60 to 70
dollar range depending on how you get it
kitted out so on the right side there's
a Q 300 P and here you can see where
they've added some panels on the top
front and sides handles it's just
expandable but at the center of it is
basically just a square box design so
this configuration here is called the Q
300 L lights and it's only going to be
30 990
so you get an acrylic side panel so you
can look inside you get some
nice-looking mesh covers for the top and
the front and they actually have a
little design on them they're talking
about potentially doing custom designs
on these if you were to buy them in bulk
or something like that so you can get a
bunch of matching pcs but for the price
looks like a very solid case and also
cool that you can have lots of upgrades
and potential rain configuration options
for it here's some power supplies there
updating the V Series v 650 V 550 I've
uses Paris plus several clients they've
been up for about four years now so
they're doing a refresh of them probably
not expecting these to come out until
about the June timeframe so maybe expect
a launch right around the Computex but
they've done some updates they have a
new quieter hundred thirty-five
millimeter fan these are all 80 plus
gold rated they have additional CPU
power connectors since the new hotness
is CPUs that draw lots of power so
making sure you've got set up to connect
to all the ones if you want and they've
even made the PCIe connectors a little
bit thicker they've gone with 16 gauge
instead of 18 gauge wire in there for a
little bit of enhanced durability are
you mentioned the collaboration with
asus this is the tough edition power
supply that goes along with those other
issues Tough Series components that I
showed anything before again digi camo
with yellow accents hard to find a
matching component unless you go this
red look guys it's H 500 P the case the
cooler master announced in June and then
came out with later in the year and
let's just say the reception was not
exactly what they were hoping thanks of
course to Steve from gamers Nexus as
well as some other folks who did some
really in-depth testing to determine
that's for a case that seems like it's
sort of geared towards airflow wasn't
getting quite enough airflow so pull the
Masters true to their word of being
masters of cooling have decided you know
what we can't accept that we need to
make a new version of this case and
updates some revisions perhaps to
address some of those issues so first
off this is weights so gonna be
available in whites they're still
working on this model it's got some
revisions possibly to make sure that you
have color matching going on everywhere
and that kind of thing but the thing you
probably noticed first and foremost is
this nice mesh
panel right across the front mesh for
airflow so those big old 200 millimeter
fans can get plenty of air going back
there but wait that's not all they've
also addressed the issue of some of the
panels being a little bit too easy in
some situations to remove so this front
panel for example they now have a little
tab at the top and you can push the tab
down and it will pop off easily like
that so easy to remove but when it's
actually in place it's going to stay in
place - so I actually physically lifted
this case earlier grabbing it by the
bottom there and it held on and stayed
just fine so that's really cool beyond
that we also have the same interior
layout as before although they have
changed up the power supply area just a
little bit you still have that sliding
panel there to accommodate potential
front mounting of radiators and that
kind of thing but actually around the
back they actually created one of those
little power supply bracket mouths so
you can mount the power supply from the
rim there and you don't necessarily have
to remove the power supply shroud in
order to get at that if still making
final decisions with this case for
example they're not sure if this back
fan is gonna be black or white or
something in between but finally they've
also added a screw that holds the top
panel on as well and it does a really
good job it's just a simple addition to
keep that in place so just a little
thumb screw pop that up and then you can
remove the top piece easily as well this
is probably gonna be available in the
original black the gray graphite color
and then they're working on this white
version as well and then they also have
a master a master version of the H 500 P
we'll get to that in a second and next
up here is our first look at the master
plus plus software it is master plus
with the plus on the end the plus is
silent oh I'm being told getting a look
right now being demonstrated by time in
tiny time Logan and all right sometimes
the basically cooler master has designed
this software to be a functional and
useful utility it's also tied into the
cloud so it does actually some of the
storage of different profiles and that
kind of thing on a cloud and allows you
to share between profiles as well they
have a actual
timeline-based it appears a solution for
setting up different RGB configurations
and they've also coordinated so that
it's coordinated it so you can actually
see the devices that are hooked up in
there so it gives you a list of those
this actually seems like some pretty
useful but also somewhat complex offer
so I kind of want to get it to get my
hands on it and dive in and see what it
can do and how it works and all that
good stuff but the click demo they have
showing it here it's just how they set
up some custom RGB profiles so the
different lights in the case will all
sync up the case we're looking at over
here on the right by the way is the new
Coolermaster MC 500m this is the master
case update they've they've reduced the
price it's only going to be a hundred
and sixty nine deck bucks now instead of
I believe that's about a $30 price drop
they're also including this really cool
RGB LED panel that goes down at the
bottom it's going to come with a couple
RGB LED fans from the front and then
that rear RGB fan is actually going to
be an on RGB family and in the final
version of that so that's that's that
you can't add it of course you can
always add a panel and lastly got to
point out that they have finally added a
USB type-c it's a USB 3.1 gen2 port on
the top there as well and they're still
even maintaining three USB 3.0 ports
alongside that so very nice
configuration so here's an example of
the master plus software being used or
something that's a little bit more
practical than just RGB LED controls
they're actually pairing it up with the
master watt 1500 power supply here doing
some overclocking and there you can view
the overclocking stuff going up on the
monitor up there and the master plus
software will show you actively stuff
like what's going on with your power
supply how much power it's drawing can
show you temperatures and that kind of
thing but if you're ever clock in oh
there's a decent chance that your system
is going to crash at some point because
if it's not thinking you're not
overclocking hard enough a unique thing
that they've been doing with the master
watt 1500 here it's it actually got it
paired it up with a Raspberry Pi unit
and then that is feeding the infant the
data real-time over to another system
and that way if you're live streaming
you're overclocking you can actually
show people what's going on even if the
system crashes and
right I'm told that helps prevent people
from asking questions over and over and
over again about what settings you are
using when the crash happened
so overclocking systems over there
there's a raspberry pi units and then
we're also feeding over to this system
over here which is also set up up up for
overclocking but then finally they're
using an additional piece of software
called overlay that live the master Plus
software and it can have a lot of
information being displayed on the
screen and also saved captured and shown
to the people watching the live stream
so they can see exactly what you're
doing and maybe figure out how high-end
overclocking actually works and over
here in this room where there are lots
of people moving around they actually
have a very expansive demo going on
again with the master plus plus software
they have a bunch of panels connected up
on the wall an LED strip down at the
bottom they've got huge banks of fans
going on on either side and then even a
couple more panels on the left on the
right side so basically you got whole
room lighting experience going on here
and when they play a demo it basically
reacts to the stuff that's on the screen
so this could be really cool for display
at an event somewhere or something like
that or if you have this set up say to
an HD PC at home in your home theater
you can have ambient lighting that
matches up to the content that you're
watching on the screen again this is all
connected up to the cloud so if you
create specific profiles you can share
them you can download them
if someone created an awesome holiday
profile something like that just go
ahead and download that plug it in so
you don't have to necessarily go around
and troll with it yourself but again
hopefully I'm gonna get a chance to try
out the software in the future and give
you guys a better idea how it works but
it seems like they've done a really good
job with it at least at first glance and
the last thing I wanted to show you guys
was a new keyboard that they're working
on it's try not gonna be out till about
Computex timeframe so maybe June but
it's called the MK eight five one and
they're trying to make sort of a new
take on the keyboard granted it's a
keyboard so it's not a whole lot you can
do but they've had a couple precision
rollers up at the top left that feel
really nice they can be used by default
for volume but you can reassign them as
well they of course got all the sex you
would you would expect Cherry MX red it
switches on this and that is very
specifically because the very unique
thing about this keyboard is you can
push a switch and that will set eight
keys right around the a sdw area to
analog mode which means that it will
detect how far down you depress them so
if you're playing a racing game for
acceleration or that sort of thing
or anything where you need more
precision than just the on/off of a
typical piece which you can do that
which is a great option for gaming
beyond that it's a really cool-looking
design overall they're gonna finish it
with a sort of black brushed metal top
plate so that's still in the works and
it's got a type-c connector at the
bottom so oh my gosh so nice that we're
seeing lots more type-c and lots of
devices we have out today but guys
that's gonna wrap it up for my coverage
here from the cooler master suites at
Palms place a big THANK YOU of course to
Coolermaster for sponsoring my CES 2018
coverage as well as my other sponsors
