for stopping by and welcome to my
unboxing of the new coolermaster iceberg
240l prestige closed-loop cpu cooler so
let's take the closer look at the
iceberg 240l got the box right here
Kirsty iceberg 240l prestige I don't
know what the prestige implies but it
seems to make it more fancy liquid cpu
cooler actually has a copper radiator
copper water block uses micro channel
and Jetstream technology so that's
referring to the technologies used in
the actual block designed in germany
hits the iceberg moniker right there now
let's take a closer look some of the
specs here around the side we can see
socket compatibility LGA 2011 1366 1156
1155 and 775 this will also fit the 1150
socket for the new Haswell cpus so
pretty much coverage for most pretty
much every modern intel socket for AMD
you got fm1 am3+ am-3 and am too so also
coverage for all your AMD sockets
respects you got your dimensions listed
right there 280 x 124 x 30 millimeter
let's 30 millimeter thickness on the
radiator the actual radiator fins
themselves are about 25 millimetres
thick fan dimensions of course standard
120 millimeter fans paid 1600 rpms 60.2
CFM fan airflow i should say fan noise
of 20.5 decibels tubing is PVC it's
black it's also got coiling around it to
keep it from kinking and then you can
see the rest of the tubing protection
the pump info the pump volume and the
pump specs a cool thing they showed over
its copy texas year was this cooler
actually powering a cosmos SE chassis
and they took the cooler they added on
they had to put it there they added on
like three more radiators to it it's
kind of silly because it was still just
gluing the cpu but it was really just to
show that the pumps that they've
included he really has a lot of power
and you can actually expand this closed
loop system add on your own stuff and
kind of expanded system so this is kind
of a good jumping off into water cooling
options so if you want to buy this and
use it standalone
then expand your loop in the future you
can there's also a closer look at these
specific dimensions of the radiator and
the pump in case you were interested
let's take a closer look now you got
your iceberg manual which is kind of
tucked over it's got all your details
for installing the pump on your
different types of sockets that's also
in different languages let's see we got
German ah there's English ok English
manual right there if you guys want to
take a closer look at the installation
procedures as well as all the
accessories that are included which I'm
about to show you as well speaking of
accessories here they are in a nice
little packets inside that packet look
at your brackets right there so these
are going to snap onto the side get a
tube of thermal paste of course from
coolermaster is the other side bracket
this is actually the AMD mounting
solution of belief alright so long
threaded screws again the manual has all
the detailed installation instructions
it's more long third screws different
lengths for the different sockets that
you might use again these are all
clearly labeled in the manual so I'm
matching on this one I've done it once
so far and it's not too tough let's have
some longer screws here for mounting the
fans one interesting choice they went
with is exactly Tsar actually hex screws
which means you need an allen wrench for
them which i thought was will say
interesting i'm not sure why they're
gonna go with with with phillips head
there and then also finally the
spring-loaded thumbscrew thumb screw
ball mounts that you see right there and
does make it a bit easier to actually
come out so the block onto your CPU will
finish with the cooler let's take a look
at the fans pretty standard 120
millimeter fans you can see right here
they do include coolermaster logo on the
back braided cable there are three pin
fans so you do have voltage control for
controlling the RPMs and then they do
also include these little rubber
grommets he reversed and off so you can
use these to provide some extra sound
dampening between the fans and wherever
they're mounted to and final
the ice berg radiator itself and as you
may or may not be able to tell you got
copper fins in here you also notice you
can see it between them so the fin
density is such that you still get to
fair amount of airflow through there to
help disperse the heat you'll notice the
mounting points is this is a 120 x 240
millimeter radiator hence the 240l
moniker you get a little bit of a
reservoir kind of built in on either end
and then you can probably see the tubing
out here which has thumbscrew ball
mounts there and you got your Inlet and
your outlet down there at the end and
then it's got nice tubing actually
really like the tubing on this units
you'll notice the coil that's wrapped
around their that is to prevent kicking
so it's loose it can actually slide a
little bit on the tubing itself and that
there's going to be a great help if your
are trying to twist this around or not
the radiator in a unique position then
you have the block itself which you can
see copper based on the bottom i'm going
to give that a cleaning before i
actually go ahead and install this you
have a clear window into actually take a
look at the pump which is kind of cool
i'm not sure how you could actually
install this and still be able to see
the pump in action because it's going to
be up against some other board and your
prime not going to get a view of it but
it's still there so you can take a look
kind of cool alright and then on the top
you got the cooler master iceberg logo
again a nice braided cable here for your
power they've also provided you with an
adapter or actually that's just an
extension so three pin power for the
pump and then it provided a little bit
of a braided extension here for the
three pins so if you do need to plug
that in somewhere a bit further away you
can do so and three pins on the end
there as well as mentioned this is an
expandable item so you'll notice a fill
port right there if you're going to use
this as a closed loop cooler just leave
this be don't undo that because it does
come fully sealed but you can undo that
and you can accept you can buy your own
tubing you can expand your loop if you
want to and
case you're wondering here the tubing is
included is a five sixteenths of an inch
inner diameter and seven sixteenth of an
inch outer diameter and that is going to
wrap it up for this video guys once
again I will be comparing the cooler
master iceberg 240l with the rest of the
CPU coolers that I have scattered around
the room here including the swiftech
h220 the corsair h 1 10 which is over
there the thermaltake water to point of
extreme which is currently in the system
over there I've been doing some testing
already so stay tuned for that hopefully
I will have it up very very soon and
yeah thanks for watching don't forget to
like the video subscribe comment share
with your friends and I'll see you all
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
