I've just arrived to Newark New Jersey
I'm actually headed to New York and it's
my first time being to New York so
that's it I'm here I may as well make a
video about it I had to get up really
early this morning sad I may or may not
actually be able to tell you guys why
I'm here so maybe that will be revealed
later on or maybe not
it means I'm I'm still debating whether
or not I should actually make the vlog
at this trip so I figured I'd eventually
one thing I always look for when I come
to New York filtered beer it's way
better than that unfiltered crap
let me get in here I guess you just
coolness or maybe since we're the beer I
know nothing about brewing beer let's
copy the time for beer
we're safe here it did in New York
you're supposed to take the subway
smells like this we're trapped we're
down here and we're trying to get up to
here so we can go to Times Square we're
probably not gonna get to Central Park
so that's okay that's okay
Central Park is dangerous at night so
I'm told
the years work very confusing some part
of the reason I was like not gonna do a
blog for this trip is like why why did
you bother doing a blog it just I mean
New York by myself it's going to show
you the experience with so that's why
I've decided to not do a blog I'm just
gonna cut this off and pretty much say
goodbye for now but
okay thank you that case it's
ebert from hardware connects guys he is
also here in New York imagine that
that's such a coincidence hey you know I
was gonna cut this this video off but
you want to go explore x squared sure
in New York one of things I've always
wanted to do so
now let's keep going it let's do it good
I look all those lights this is really
happening this is every
are you excited for I'm kind of excited
I'm a little excited I don't know I'm
not sure how excited I should be exactly
so I'm not trying it too excited I just
like to see a lot of lights
who that backpacks for life.org
I've never been more excited about
backpacks for life.org super super
awesome this is amazing it's incredible
there's so many lights and some people
and its glorious it you know one thing
I'm very impressed with here they have a
gift store or is it a jiff store I can't
I can't tell if it's a jiff store or a
gift store
either maybe it's
either way we should probably go in
there and get something short short
video clips Time Square New York City
you can see so many people gathered for
this auspicious occasion remember to
trust in Jesus all together on these
steps here and you can participate in a
ceremony which I'm told will resurrect
the dead or it's also some Germans going
over here this is amazing I don't know I
don't even know I don't even know what
to say
it's overwhelming I'm kind of weeping a
single tear rolls down my cheek the main
thing I'm trying to do is figure out
which which Broadway show I should go to
we've got we've got inky boots we have
the spongebob squarepants we've got a
Bronx Tale up there also I like this
direction we got Chicago apparently
there's something called waitress
that's just an American Eagle Outfitters
I don't know why I'm even showing that
well I think Spongebob Squarepants
though that's what I want to see what do
you think Jeff oh hi Jeff that's gone
look it's Jeff and tech record easier -
that's totally random oh my gosh
unprecedented fact all right
everyone go go read tech report articles
and stuff continue her on our way now
we've we ditched Times Square or too
many lights starting to make us nervous
about all the lights they were you want
to have some sort of place to hide at a
moment's notice
be ready if it attack occurs something
like that obviously so we've made our
way over to here where get a little bit
more covered now if we need to and also
the historic Radio City Music Hall
they've done stuff there in the past
the Rainbow Room
I don't
I don't know what goes on in there I
they imagine its body though
we have now discovered why it is so cold
here in New York because all these
selfish ice skaters have kept the
weather cold so that they could continue
to skate on ice but I just wanted to let
everyone know that over here we have
this golden statue
I believe this Neptune or perhaps Zeus
or or the I think it step tune anyway
tall this is boiling water and it's
gonna be released out onto the ice
skating rink and it will consume all the
ice skaters and that in New York is how
you know that Spring has from it's a
lovely time don't think we're gonna be
around for it though so we've been
walking around New York for a while we
have learns pretty much everything there
is to know about the city it's glorious
city I got robbed here from tech age
completely random then here's TVs here -
so Rob what have you learned today and
sharing this experience with people New
York it's very cool
point where I'm going
which I wasn't expecting they're gonna
be consumed by the hell fires with the
neptune down there and the angry angry
goldman guy you can see that
I'm gonna disappoint we're gonna miss
that because
tomorrow morning but I assume it'll be
broadcast on the news
there we go go breathe step on second
I just wanted to go through one of these
turnstiles with the curvy I carry things
and back on an airplane again it's
raining it's supposed to snow actually
the heck New York it's supposed to be
springtime
back in Orange County very happy about
that I need to get lift
look look I'm home alright guys I've
made it home and my first question is
did my wife do the dishes no no she did
not that will be up to me so I'm back
home and that means it is time to end
this video I really wasn't sure what
this video was all about it was just
kind of a running gun thing so let me
end with a question for you guys at home
if I'm doing something like I just did a
short trip that has things involved with
it that I can't necessarily share but
it's also taking my time away that I
would normally be making a video out of
would you rather see just a random vlog
--is-- do like this about my travels
that's you know shares a little bit but
really there's not a whole lot going on
there or no so give me a thumbs up or a
thumbs down I guess not to be too Lynas
like at the end of this video
thank you for watching though if you
have and I guess subscribe for more
videos coming in the future I am going
to have food I haven't had lunch yet
hungry okay thanks guys
we'll see you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
