well hi everyone and welcome to Pauls
hardware today's video wasn't already
obvious is gonna be about this case from
deep cool it's probably one of the
biggest cases that I have dealt with
here in my garage
it's the quad steller it's very large
and I'm basically going to take it out
of the box and the simplest system in it
and let you guys know how it goes let's
get straight
let's start off with a kind of once-over
just getting it out of the box so you
guys can see packaging and everything
and of course the layout of the quad
stellar I've actually covered the quad
stellar a little bit in show coverage at
Computex last year and at CES at the
beginning of this year and some people
have asked hey when's it's actually
gonna launch because it's a pretty
unique design getting it out of the box
it's actually it's still pretty large
because it's got a pretty wide stance
but it's not quite as huge as I feel
like I felt like it was that probably
doesn't make that much sense but
basically you have metal frames that
actually go around these are aluminum
around each of the four quadrants and
then you have tempered glass pieces that
are affixed to each of those these don't
remove they're actually fixed in place
but I do want to point out that there is
a small gap in between those so it is
slightly open air and I'm losing focus
here because I'm trying to use out of
focus but just just something I I
noticed that I don't think I had noticed
when I first looked at this at the show
so these are all not how they should
look these are actually all covered with
some plastic key bits and I can peel off
slowly for you guys but the four
chambers allow you to support the
motherboard which just fits an angle
kind of down here it also the power
supply chamber in the lower left up here
in the top right quadrant is where your
graphics cards will go and it comes with
some ribbon cables to connect those up
to the motherboard and then this chamber
and the top left is all for storage and
this will make a lot more sense once I
actually start to open up the different
pieces leaving off more plastic
so much fun this one here 201 felt
different than the others weird as for
packaging on the tempered glass
they're basically held in with some tape
it seems so I've put some actual pieces
of foam under here too which probably
it's just helping keeping those rattle
around during shipping well that piece
is really kind of stuck in Harry okay
let's just pull the plastic off of these
top tempered glass pieces and give me a
sec to get all these off I can actually
show you what the case looks like that
packaging he's really her wedged in
there
okay I've removed most of the plastic
and everything except there's plastic on
the inside of these lower tempered glass
pieces as well so I'm gonna need to get
that in a second but now you can at
least see how reflective this case is
because you have reflective pieces on
the front these are plastic pieces up
here and then of course the tempered
glass on the top and the sides as well
while I'm up here you can point out the
actual front panel I oh you got a couple
USB 3.0 ports those little mic and a
headphone jack as I've been stating
since the end of 2017 we're really
looking for USB C ports on these cases
especially the high-end ones so that
would have been nice to see here but you
at least get the basics taken care of
right there okay if I'm remembering
correctly this is actually the power
button right here as well although we'll
need to test that once we actually get
everything set up I believe there's a
manual inside there too but we'll get
these pieces these panels off in just a
second real quick though just to show
you guys another look directly from the
back and here's where you can see where
the motherboard sits
sort of at a 45 degree angle right there
with the i/o shield would be here the
expansion slots would be here then you
can also see how some of the cooling
works on this since most of these
individual chambers can be cooled by 120
millimeter intake and exhaust fans so
that's pretty nice as well and then here
you can also get a better look at where
your graphics cards go ayuh would be
right up there and then again over here
would be storage and in the bottom right
is where your power supply goes
located the product manual never seen a
product manual delivered in this format
aha glorious okay as I managed to remove
all of the aluminum panels on the four
quadrants of the quad stellar and was
also able to remove the manual scroll
which is tucked in there and held with a
few velcro straps and everything so this
gives us a better idea of being able to
look inside and see what the heck's
going on in there as well as where
everything's supposed to go as well as
my a bit of confusion as to whether or
not not there's actually a mechanical
element to these pieces up front these
little flaps up front are supposed to be
able to open up a little bit and as
messing with this one and I I loosened
it I think we need to actually get the
power connected up there so that we can
actually mess with a little bit more so
I'll come back to that in just a second
here's a look at the lower chamber
though where your power supply would go
right there and as you can tell
basically any like power supply will fit
in there it also gives us a look at the
back of the motherboard tray down here
so first off you'll probably notice
there's tons and tons of tie-down points
all along here there's also this
contraption which is a central control
board unit which controls a bunch of the
fans it can all be connected up through
there there's also a digital LED input
that you can do there to control the
digital RGB LEDs aren't that around the
case you also have PWM fan functions so
they've also conveniently included a
little chart here so you can point out
which of those connectors are at which
the case actually comes with five
hundred and twenty millimeter fans that
are pre-installed so for those fans are
on the four of the intakes where the
little flaps and the front go and then
the only chamber that has an exhaust fan
here is the storage chamber right here
so your hard drives can stay nice and
cool and that's definitely probably
going to be a feature that people use
for this case because given the size I
imagine practically speaking you're
probably going to want a system that you
put a lot of hardware into including
lots of drives over on this side we can
see the
other side of the motherboard tray and
they have you know high-end features you
would assume would come with a case
that's a little bit more on the
expensive side such as some rubber pass
through for your grommets you can see
like your just be three extension and
that kind of thing or they're all black
a little bit of color on the HD audio
cable there but not a huge deal and you
do have the option to either use this
ribbon cable here to take your graphics
card and put it up in the top section
they've included one ribbon extension
cable here so if you're gonna go for SLI
you would need to get a second one of
those but you can do two graphics cards
an SLI or crossfire up there and then
you just have this whole wide-open
chamber here so if you're gonna do water
cooling probably some decent amount of
space right there since you will be able
to get a view of this from in the top
through the tempered glass panel and
then of course you got that dedicated
fan cooling this entire chamber so
especially if you're just putting a
single graphics card in there you should
have plenty of airflow another thing
I've noticed about this case as I'm
looking it over and also as indicated in
the manual is the entire thing can
pretty much be broken down into its
constituent pieces everything is held on
by Phillips head screws like you can see
up here for these top cross beams that
just help from support the case you
could take the entire thing apart I
haven't found any rivets on the entire
system and that is definitely a good
thing looking over at the storage area
here's a single spot for you 2.5 inch
hard drive so if you have a nice SSD
that would be visible through the top
glass panel and then of course you've
got these removable trays here support
3.5 inch or 2.5 inch drives and that
will give you lots and lots of storage
another thing about the storage tray is
you have four Phillips head screws one
two three and four right here and then
there's a few thumb screws that hold it
on down at the bottom so plenty of
support but you can remove that and pull
this entire tray out so you can set up
all your drives in it how you want to
get things wired up especially if you're
doing a nine drive configuration that's
a very convenient feature to have
and speaking of removing everything
again all these little brackets that
hold everything together can be removed
with Phillips head screws down at the
end each little tray can be removed and
that means that yes even the motherboard
tray there if you completely descent
disassemble the whole thing the
motherboard tray is free-floating kind
of
itself so you could pull that out to get
your stuff installed on it if you want
to I guess I'm getting my hard work
together but I've realized there's a
couple more things I wanted to point out
about this case really quickly one is
continuing along the water cooling
support theme which is where do you
install radiators in this thing the most
practical place to install like a CPU
radiator and CPU would be right in this
area there's gonna be along these two
brackets right here this will support a
240 millimeter read install in it
it is a little bit longer actually and
the same brackets exist right up here so
I wouldn't be surprised if some modders
maybe are able to wedge something
lengthier than 240 but basically you
have support for a 240 here a 240 here
up on this bracket and then you could
also do another radiator down here in
the power supply area if you were so
inclined again that's probably moving
more towards custom water cooling
configurations but good to know you got
plenty of support for your rads and the
fans wherever you might put them I also
wanted to real quickly show you guys the
accessories that come in the box
other than the screws I've been removing
I do want to point out they're not all
captive thumb screws the ones in the
back do pop up but some of the internal
ones are a captive some some screws so I
don't think that was neglectful it's
just something they decided not to do
for the main chambers anyway I've got a
couple extensions here for your pwm fans
so depending on where in the case you
want to route those we've got those
available so you can connect those up to
that included smart hub and then you've
got this baggie with a bunch of extra
stuff here including some zip ties and
then individually labeled fan screws
hard drive screws fan extender screws
for going to radiators or going through
fans into radiators power supply screws
all the accessories that units as well
as a couple velcro straps there as well
ok let's move on to the build I'm about
to put together this was kind of hastily
chosen from the parts that I have lying
around here in the garage for storage is
gonna throw in a single SSD so we're
doing kind of the bare minimum of
hardware in here but this is the Samsung
850 pro 512 gig over here we've got our
power supply slightly used EVGA 750 watt
g3 with the sleeved extension kit from
EVGA
we've got a 16 I'm sorry 32 gig kits of
Trident z memory for our quad channel
memory can
figuration for our processor the asus
strix Radeon Vegas 64 just very nice
card that's too bad they're all
overpriced everywhere but what can you
do right now then finally for some
cooling for the CP you've got the NZXT
Krakens ex 62 I think all that's gonna
make a damn fine build so why don't I go
ahead and put it all together
well guys I've decided I need to pull an
audible here and change up some of the
hardware that I have chosen for this
build main reason is due to
compatibility with a cooling solution
here now of course I originally chose to
do a thread repair build with the 1950 X
right here an ace you seen it's extreme
which I thought was a good option
because it's a higher-end configuration
this is a higher-end case costing about
$400 399 MSRP and it's e-atx which means
it's gonna you know this is a case that
supports bigger motherboards so that was
a good solution now what I realized is
the 1950 X doesn't ship with a cooler it
ships with this little bracket that you
can use with an ace tech based cooler so
you can get an a liquid cooler on there
now unfortunately the NZXT kraken X 62
that I was originally going to use
actually has a two hundred and eighty
millimeter radiator two hundred and
forty millimeter fans in this case
actually only supports hundred and
twenty millimeter fans everywhere the
intakes the brackets for radiators that
are in positioned in different areas so
that meant I needed a all-in-one liquid
cooler that had a turn in 40 millimeter
radiator that was compatible with this
ace tech mount and I basically don't
have that anywhere here so what I've
done is rather than changing up my
liquid cooling solution well I am doing
that too but I needed to change up the
liquid cooling solution to be compatible
with these brackets and I'm also
changing up the actual foundation of the
entire build by switching over to the
rampage six extreme going with an Intel
build X to 99 chipset and I have swapped
in the 79 80 X key the extreme edition
18 core Intel processor in there so it's
still gonna be a ridiculous high-end
build super fancy high in a CA TX
motherboard and everything it's still
gonna use quad channel memory I guess
that's what the swap these dims over but
difference is the socket here the actual
mounting solution for my cooler which
I'm not going to be using a deep cool
cooler as well since I've switched over
the captain's here for TX which does
have support for LG LGA 2011 socket so
let's finish I'm ready to have this
thing put together
okay guys I'm about ready to put the
external shroud the cast aluminum pieces
back over the four quadrants here but I
wanted to show you guys at least a quick
look internally at how I've got
everything set up before we move on
there I want to point out at least for
this main chamber down here where the
motherboard tray goes and everything
there is both the 240 Mountain down here
for a couple 120 millimeter fans or a
240 millimeter radiator you can also do
a 360 at an angle going up that way so 3
by 120 it's again narrower so lonely if
it's hundred 20 millimeter fans but if
you've got a bigger radiator or if
you're going for more expansive water
cooling project or just to know what's
it's capable of supporting 360 rad
Mountain goes right up there as well and
that bracket that holds it can actually
be removed along with pretty much all
the panels in this case all these
supporting beams and everything or I'll
hold on by phillips-head screws so you
can really disassemble this entire thing
if you wanted to for example get at the
motherboard tray individually or any of
the brackets for mounting the radiators
and that kind of thing
I for example mounted this radiator with
the bracket still on there but you could
remove these pieces not the radiator to
it and then screw it back in over here
if you wanted to as well just your
option for however you want to put the
system together I've got the deep cool
captain 240 X down here at the bottom
it's the white version which doesn't
blend in quite as well but that's how
its installed and that's how I've got it
configured I do want to point out that
there's a little bit of a lack of space
here I mean it's just pretty tight in
there I've got a single just a push
configuration going on with this
radiator so if you want to push a pole
you probably wouldn't be able to fit it
there you'd conflict with the
motherboard up here but that's not too
much of a critique just sort of a
planning thing to keep in mind because
obviously there's a lot more places in
the case where you could fit radiators
but if you
all in one you're pretty much probably
gonna be only gonna be able to fit here
or in the front space right over there
beyond that though our Vegas 64 Strix
Edition is installed up here in the
upper chamber and I've got everything
wired for power
as far as LEDs I've pretty much gone
with the default configuration for this
case this case doesn't ship with a
separate LED strip but I did at least
wire up the RGB LEDs to connect to the
motherboard on the deep cool captain and
then I'll see if I can connect the
controller board up to that - here's a
look at the cable management area and
it's pretty simple to cable manage just
because there's lots of space down here
and they have included tons and tons of
tie-down points which I definitely
appreciates and here's the controller
board as well all of the pre-installed
520 millimeter fans are all pre wired up
to this board - so that's nice and you
can connect to this board and control it
with an app so I'm gonna get that app
installed and also give you guys some
footage with this completed build and
while I'm getting ready to put these
side panels back on there is protective
plastic on the inside
several the tempered glass pieces as
well
alright here goes oh my god
alive
well guys at this point it is time for
me to wrap up this video because
honestly I've spent way way more time on
this case and this build than I
originally intended to and all that said
I don't even have like a full-featured
final review for you guys so I apologize
but I'm gonna quickly go down the pros
and the cons that I have come across and
determined for you today
so pros it's got a unique eye catching
lookin design for sure it's a very
different case it's a very different
sized case shape case you don't
immediately know it's a computer case
looking at it and it definitely could
fit a ton of hardware in there EA tech
support for the motherboard you can
support up to three graphics cards in
the top cage here and if for whatever
reason you wanted to do a four way
solution you could fit that in the lower
area but I don't think that's really
practical for how its design also tons
of space for hard drives and SSDs up
there in the drive area finally you can
definitely tell that this is a flagship
case from deep pool because the build
quality is very top-notch not only do
they have these very hefty and pretty
sturdy cast aluminum pieces for all the
four quadrants but the entire thing is
held together by screws Phillips head
screws screws for the most part so it's
really cool that you can get in there
and disassemble the whole thing if you
so desire now that's not to say it's
perfect case by any stretch so let's go
over the cons there's no 5 and quarter
inch bays probably not a big deal for
most people but it is a larger case
sometimes people look for those 4
reservoirs and that kind of thing does
have some full built-in LEDs on the
front here in the gamer storm logo up on
the top but we don't include an
additional LED strip along with it that
is something that they include with like
the the cooler for example so so I
thought an extra LED strip might have
been a nice add on the CPU cooler height
limitation is kind of surprising it's
110 millimeter total Heights so it's not
the best solution for air cooling kits
it sorry if you're building in a case
like this you're gonna go for water
cooling but it is important to know that
higher and air coolers won't fit in
there it's also worth pointing out that
you have only 120 millimeter fan support
wherever you
can put fans in this case they're all
120 which isn't a huge deal but you
don't have the massive radiator support
in various different configurations 420
140 millimeter fans like you do with
some other high ends more expensive
cases like the quad stellar this case is
four hundred dollars and in my opinion
once you get beyond the 150 to 200
dollar price point you are getting into
the realm of I'm paying more money for
special unique features that maybe
aren't so practical so from that
perspective the quad stellar does make
sense it stands out it's well-built and
it's got support for the hardware you
need that said practically speaking I
was actually pretty frustrated with this
case over the past day or two just
trying to get things finalized in here
for one thing the ability to just open
up your case get in there to do
something real quick if you like to
tinker a lot is very challenging with
this case you've got to remove these
panels which can only slide off from the
back so if the case is positioned
somewhere you'd have to probably pull it
out from where it wherever it is to get
at that I was having issues connecting
the deep cool app which you can use to
connect to the controller board that's
in there in order to control this
lighting and do various effects I had
zero luck doing that since I wasn't able
to connect with my smartphone I had to
pull the side panel off in order to get
at the PCB and there's a button on there
that you can supposedly hold in for six
seconds in order to reset it I did that
didn't work still wasn't able to connect
so after I wasn't able to get the app to
work I hardwired it up to the direct
connection for the digital LED control
from the motherboard to the controller
PCB and I'm not sure that's working
either but like I said guys I am
completely out of time for this video so
I have to leave it here I hope you guys
learned a little bit more about the deep
cool quad stellar case in my build and
assessment of my building experience
video here if the thumbs up button if
you did enjoy it
also leave me a comment in the comment
section down below let me know if this
case piques your interest at all and of
course subscribe to my channel for more
tech videos coming at you really soon
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
