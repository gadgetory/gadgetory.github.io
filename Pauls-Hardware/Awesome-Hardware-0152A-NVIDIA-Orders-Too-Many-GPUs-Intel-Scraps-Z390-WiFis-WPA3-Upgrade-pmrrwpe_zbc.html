should I
I've kind of a opened Pandora's box now
by drinking this first beer because I'm
still very jet-lagged I've been up since
3:00 a.m. actually 250 this morning
and I started crashing earlier today and
then I've had this first beer and now if
I stop drinking I will just I'll tank so
I can't I can't stop drinking well
that's quite a predicament you're in
Kyle yep it's a good thing we're that
our show revolves around drinking
constantly before we go down that road
to car it's a quick introduction hello
everyone and welcome this is awesome
hardware it's a live show about
technology Kyle and I talk about things
we drink a few beers a quick word of
warning there is occasional foul
language this is meant for adults it's
not like crazy bad all the time that's
quite head on that beer they can't
forgotten how to drink beer but just
like to start off with a quick
disclaimer there but thank you guys so
much for joining us we stream live to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware and we
also stream live to each of our YouTube
channels you're watching part 1 episode
152 streaming on my channel Paul's
hardware and in about an hour so we'll
switch the second half - Kyle's channel
we sure leave in the description as well
as just about everything we're going to
talk about today so check those out for
further details on the stories and
whatnot but if you guys have been
missing us we've been missing you too
because we have been like gone would
there was we I went to Japan and then we
both were in Taiwan and then Kyle went
to Japan there was other stuff
surrounding all those so thank you guys
all for rejoining us today and if you
have completely forgotten about our show
we don't blame you at all no it's gonna
be bad though but let's begin the show
by saying Cheers well he is I guess
thank you guys for the warm welcomes and
chance when building love why did the
first ones didn't do this I think maybe
because we're pouring the beer in like
because you already had I had a little
bit of beer left in my cup when I
started it's like a chemical reaction of
the beer that's the beer on beer action
is it's not reacting
we should pour more slowly we're
drinking Presidente beer this is from
the Dominican Republic and was sent to
us by a fan present of foam save the
thing I almost feel like I wanted to get
a spoon and just start spooning the foam
out eating evening foam spoonfuls of
foam oh you have the letter attached -
yeah I wanted to say this is from Santo
Domingo Dominican Republic from a
dominican family living in the USA they
didn't write Lind they didn't stay cool
anyway thank you dominican family from
the USA and choose and take you all for
joining us once again Cheers I will
drink my now for the head settles more
ok yeah oh thank you chat Wow all right
you know what let's just it's in the
background you guys love that I'm just
gonna let it go yep all right a quick
plug for our stores if you guys wanna
help support us think yourself some
merchandise it's the best way to do it
my store is pulsar Burnett it's your
last chance for limited-edition metallic
silver thumbscrews the chanters tribe
lens and lightweight hoodies get those
now before they go out of stock in a
modern fashion we got the new Heather
midnight navy t-shirts but lots of
different stuff shirts mugs pint glasses
bottle openers buy stuff bit with that
tech slash doors Cal store yep the state
positive shirts are still there we've
got tons of mouse pads and desk mats
those are all very popular yeah
coasters and mugs and glasses and things
like that
oh good things buy everything we get
nothing but positive feedback as to the
quality of our merchandise yeah cuz we
didn't want just tell you crap no we
watch it we're not blast we wear our own
shit that should say something is also
awesome hardware themed merchandise like
the shirt I'm wearing right now and if
you buy that from either of our store
don't worry the profits are split
between us right it's a it's a very
socialist
I was to describe that but don't take
that out of context let's let's let's
get into the actual stuff we're gonna
talk about just get into it oh that's
wrong that's completely wrong that's mud
wrestle with it Oh lower thirds Larry
we're relearning everything
Todd heavy hardware is what we're gonna
start out with so I'm just a new
hardware to discuss um some of its in
the future so I kind of broke the rules
with the segment a little bit but in the
future cares about that yeah in the
future but this is available right now
the asus rog swift PG to 7uq there's
actually two new monitors that are
finally out these monitors are 4k g-sync
with HDR and they're 27 inches there's
this Asus one and then there is also a
where there's an Acer right yes there's
a nicer one - yeah there's an Acer one -
the Easter predator X 27 so good old Ken
Addison over a PC / has checked this out
and done a full review so again linked
in the description if you guys want to
check it out and get all the gritty
details but here's kind of the spec
sheet right here 27 inch 4k 144 Hertz
g-sync of course with HDR DisplayPort
1.4 for millisecond great great response
time 1001 contrast ratio capable capable
of displaying 1.07 billion colors which
which is the 10-bit color gamut but it
is actually an 8-bit display with
dithering and thankfully they did put
that out on this on this thing to be
nice of them somewhat specific so yeah
basically it's sort of like a handful of
some of the best features that you
people have been looking for in a gaming
monitor not just the 4k resolution but
also the high refresh rate and HDR and
and the g-sync it's also got 384 zone
local dimming for the back lights and
it's even compatible with display HDR
1000 and that is one of the differences
between the asus monitor and Acer
does have the display HDR 1000
certification whereas the Acer does not
speculation the article is that somehow
Asus did like got better source like the
the panels are probably coming from the
same location I believe but they
actually did a teardown in the article
for instance there is an active cooling
fan back behind the the vase amount
which I thought was sort of interesting
it's also a fairly like bulky display
like it's got a big old that's gonna
leave a corner it's big it's there we go
a big thick display I've seen I have
checked this out at some shows because
it's been teased for a while 18 months
Sunday since they first actually
revealed this it was demoed at CES 2017
those look at the back though so you can
also see it's got some RGB that's that
scroll wheel in the back I don't know
I'm not sure what that does I want to
touch it it's an extra just a mouse
scroll when you just scroll it on the
back there just think emergency scroll
wheels you're looking at the back of the
monitor and you decide you want to
scroll I guess there's also a full
keyboard behind now a few interesting
things about the display related in the
article one is that you can't quite get
the maximum refresh rates as well as the
maximum color gamut 98 Hertz is the
limits at which the monitor will switch
from a four four four four four chroma
subsampling to four to two which can
have different effects it's not gonna
affect you for like watching movies and
stuff like that so HDR content in that
respect will be okay but four to two
compared to four four four is sometimes
blamed unlike some like texts having
sort of being a little bit blurry at the
edges and stuff simply because there's
not as much color data per pixel so yeah
if you want to go max refresh rates you
do lose a little bit of the color depth
they said that using the monitor in 98
Hertz mode was a good
compromising 98 Hertz with juice Inc is
a nice smooth display but since it is a
$2,000 monitor it has just gone up on up
for pre-order on Friday for 2 grand 2
grands a lot for a 27-inch monitor so it
is something that someone investing that
much would probably be interested in
knowing about did go for pre-order
Friday June 22nd I believe it's a new
egg listed release date is July 13th
which was a little bit later than aces
originals originally promised launched
which was late June but just a few more
weeks to two and a half weeks or so and
in the meantime of course you can read
the article and get all the all the
dirty info very very III I got through
most of this article and it was very
well done by Ken I especially liked the
full teardown that they did in the back
they said it wasn't too difficult to get
inside of but here is the actual new
g-sync module so you guys can get a look
at it and they actually looked at this
they looked at a lot of the identifying
marks and codes and whatnot on all the
circuits and chips that were on there
they were able to determine that this is
FPGA from Altera it's the Intel Altera
area 10g X 480 FPGA there's also a bunch
of ddr4 memory on there a total of three
gigs ddr4 is not cheap right now cheaper
than it used to be but quote from the
article is I wouldn't be surprised to
see this FPGA alone making up $500 of
the final price points of these new
displays let alone the cost of the ddr4
memory so if you're looking at that
$2,000 price tag I mean like man g-sync
monitors are expensive it Atlee I mean
there's two ways to look at it one is
like yeah she sync monitors that your
premium they're still premium products
it'd be nice to see some more budget
ones but the other side is like well at
least you can look at this hardware and
you can kind of price out and be like
alright it's not just some months it's
not just some crappy little chip in
there that's like doing some quick
Hardware validation to make sure you
actually have
the right hardware for g-sync support
yeah there's actually some old bloom
stuff going on there so yeah conclusions
from PC perspective are that it's
expensive makes sense
yeah that's pretty straightforward it
also is a 27 inch 4k monitor and I
certainly have had experiences with 27
inch 4k monitors in the past where I was
like you know 27 inches is a little
small it's a little small for a 4k
monitor I have ever gaming what's really
tiny yeah Windows 10 has improved some
of that scaling stuff a little bit's but
yeah 32 inches like Maya that's my sweet
spot for 4k yeah it's for 16 16 by 9
aspect ratio so it'll be cool to see one
of these in 32 inches although God knows
how much that will actually cost after
noting those caveats they said
everything else is really awesome pretty
much as you would expect also the true
HDR they were very complimentary of that
you have to have the right source
material of course to really take
advantage of HDR or at least those
significant difference did they say what
kind of games they tested what kind of
HDR games we're tested it's all it's
something that's on the third page I
don't know my gaming impressions may be
far cry 5 or something
cry 5 yes okay which is one of the
modern games designed for this year in
mind yeah okay well that's good I'm glad
that they nailed the HDR down finally
because it's true HDR taking screenshots
of HDR games is difficult so these
photos of the screen we're taking with
an iPhone X and it's almost like what's
the point of taking the pictures but
they also tried out destiny - okay cool
yeah cuz HDR has been really hit and
miss for gaming monitors up until now I
think so
yeah this is a feature that a lot of
people have been waiting for
so yes that's cool if you got the money
and if you're okay with 27 inch 4k then
PC / gave it the gold award so there you
go comes comes recommended let's move on
though to the next bit of cotton have
you heard we're so XIII 90 we've kind of
discussed chipsets like over the past
say year or so and how they've gotten
progressively more confusing and how
there's this sort of annoying
back-and-forth going on between Intel
and AMD with the chipset naming schemes
and like there's too many different
chipsets and it's baffling at times so
when we heard that the Intel was going
to launch a z3 90 chipset a successor to
z3 70 which was just launched towards
the end of last year it added another
sort of wrench or just another chipset
to keep him to keeping your minds to the
mix of all the rest of them that were
already there and now apparently they
might be scrapping it so this is not
confirmed information it is still in the
rumor category but according to this
article from OSI 3d Dot nets until might
just not go it just might not produce z3
90 at all or at least not in the way
that they had explained to us that it
would now to step back and realize why
they needed a z3 90 as well as a z3 70
in the first place is z3 70 was rushed
basically they needed an answer to AMD's
launch a verizon they wanted to get
higher core counts on their mainstream
platform they decided to make a z3 70
chipset as well as a LGA 1151 socket
that wasn't backwards compatible with
last generation skylake incapabie like
processors it was only compatible with
the newest copy leaked processors and
that is their current mainstream
platform now Intel is currently sort of
straddling a couple different nodes as
far as what they're actually
manufacturing so the older Z 370 chipset
was actually manufactured on 22
nanometer manufacturing process but
earlier this year in like April Intel
launched the sort of lower
and LGA 1151 socket chipsets which were
H 370 be 360 I think there's like a h3
10 as well and those actually had
advantages over z3 70 launched last year
which was that they had native USB 3.1
gen2 support as well as integrated Intel
wireless AC which is nice to have for
chipset z3 70 boards launched last year
did have those features but they were
added on with like a chip that was a you
know it's separate from the chipset
itself it is that native right and there
there are pros and cons to that but
usually the native stuff is is best
there has been in the past so rumor has
it that Intel is scrapping the z3 90 and
instead replacing it with a refreshed z3
70 chipset while also using third-party
controllers to offer the same features
as their original z3 90 chipset so
promise of z3 90 was it would be
manufactured on 40 nanometer instead of
22 nanometer I would integrate USB 3.1
gen2 and wireless AC now they're saying
they're going to do like a z3 70 like
version to write that like so that would
be like a manufacturer requirement so
motherboards that are that z3 70 updated
version would be required to have those
features in order to provide parity with
like you know cuz it kind of sucks to be
like it'd be like oh yeah here's an h3
70 board which is theoretically lower
ends but it actually has 802 that 11 AC
which this supposedly higher ends z3 70
board doesn't act doesn't have because
I'm sure that's not the case across all
of those motherboards so yeah it's it's
confusing
a little bit but there does seem to be
some reason behind it according again to
the article it says some claim until
it's hitting peak capacity that for
their 40 nanometers process node
limiting their production there's been
lots of discussion about 10 nanometer
and
and the hardware that's based on that
like cannon lake being delayed and that
means that their current mainstream
lineup is still being manufactured on 14
nanometer something they move their
chipsets to that same process and there
they're hitting capacity again according
to the article is what they're saying so
they don't have any more room to
manufacture more 40 nanometer stuff
because all of their mainstream
processes right now are on 40 nanometer
their new low range chipsets for the 300
series around 40 nanometer and now
adding AZ 390 chipset to that production
lineup as well is simply too difficult
or too tough to keep up with again
according to the article if this rumor
is true so does this mean that z9t will
no will never be a thing or do you think
that they will eventually have a Z 390
chipset that is that actually has a new
process the article is to be believed Z
390 will just never be an actual product
that launches ok there will be a Z 370
refet refresh right and that will be hit
I see on the plus side one less chipset
skew to have to remember Z 390 versus C
370 versus H 370 versus B 360 versus H
310 I think I actually got all those
correct Wow like that's that's that's
Intel mainstream that's not including
any of the other chipsets from like the
just a year ago that's not even diving
into the AMD stuff that they have going
on and and that's already confusing in
and of itself so removing Z 390 from
that list it's kind of like just a
smidge simplifies that lineup until you
find out that the next generation of
Intel chipsets is called Z 470 yeah yeah
then you're like fuck so but anyway just
at least something to keep in mind
especially if you were someone who is
maybe like waiting for Z 390 I don't
know I don't know if there's any people
who were kind of like hanging out I've
been like
once see 390 launches that's what I'm
gonna build my new gaming PC but again
this falls under the rumor category so
green assault and all that okay oh that
one last thing to point out the
downsides apart to what we've already
mentioned of a refresh 22 nanometers III
70 is it would consume a little bit more
power because you do get some power draw
savings with the smaller node and then
of course manufacturers that use three
pretty chips for the promised features
just like they already have with c37 um
but now there'd be some sort of actual
set requirements for calling your
motherboards III 70 that's what
speaking of Intel and chipsets and
Intel's mainstream platform Intel 8 core
CPUs have also been rumored since Intel
launched the six core coffee lake 8700 K
yep they they've been people being like
well they're probably gonna do an 8 core
since AMD now has a core on their main
stream platform and core count is often
one of the fundamental things people
look at and it just looks bad to Intel
for AMD to be able to say look we have
this eight core on rayna that you can
get set up with so there have been
rumors and speculation about an eight
core Intel mainstream CPU not just for
the desktop consumer side but also the
zeon side and Xeon does have a small LGA
1151 socket platform as well the
question has been though that if Intel
does actually come out with and launch
any core CPU since just last year they
forced people who were on the previous
platform who wanted to go from four
cores to six cores to buy a new 300
series chipset motherboard now if they
launched an eight core mainstream one
like would you have had to have buy that
bought that z3 90 or the z3 70 version
two that we that we just discussed
yeah in order to support that said eight
core CPU we're kind of in the exact same
spot we were a year ago because we're
once again dealing with Intel changing
the number of cores on their main stream
chip and according to some potential
information this actually came out from
an antic
a poster called dune posted some
screenshots actually digging into the
code of 300-series motherboard bios's by
bios ease however you gonna say and they
found that there actually does appear to
be listing for eight core processors or
support or just information in there
about eight core processors z 370 and h3
ten motherboards have hidden bias
options that reference support for up to
eight processing cores as you can kind
of see in the screenshot that they
posted a further verified by a redditor
eric 98k who also found similar
references and bios files from as rock
and gigabyte woozi 370 motherboards so
the fact that it's ended multiple boards
multiple chipsets from multiple vendors
does seem to indicate that that might be
the case but of course different
motherboards have different power
delivery if Intel was to like go with
this type of support maybe they could
make various modes that the eight core
processor could operate in so like if
you you know if they're talking h3 ten
here for an 8 core processor if you drop
the highest-end
eight core cpu from Intel whatever that
ends up being into an h3 time
motherboard that's you know a budget $70
board or something like that I wouldn't
expect it to be able to run on all eight
cores at whatever maximum turbo
frequency it's supposed to hit like that
so maybe there's different modes that it
can run in like have lower TDPS so that
it can actually operate in boards that
have you know they don't quite have the
power delivery to match up with that
this is all speculation but just you
know it could be done Intel could
definitely arrange this and according to
this at least it seems like maybe that
is what they're doing if you look at the
same information on z3 70 boards there's
only four options available for four
cores four core count one two three and
all if you look at that and though on
Intel three hundred cities motherboards
you can see listings for one through
eight as well as all mentioned
explicitly so a slight variation there
because the older boards don't have one
two three four and all but
just just a minor issue but littl little
little details pulled from the depths of
the internet shared with you guys here
there we go that's all for on heavy
hardware cool hopefully we'll find out
more information about that soon and I'm
sure we'll share it with you guys here
on the show or or we won't in the video
or perhaps we'll just won't do that at
all you'll never know unless you find
out elsewhere
all right let's belong moving on you
know we're doing some news yeah we're
just driving straight through my content
for my half of the show we're gonna do
Q&amp;amp;A after this so if you guys have any
other any questions for us please please
go ahead and post that and I want to say
a big shout-out to cell so cells around
here right yeah hi cell he's around
cells our mod he thank you for being
here so okay let's get into tech news I
should give it I should also give a
shout out to keidel cuz Kyle actually
helps gather some of this tech news for
me today I did yes
you've all been warned I had to drop
nori off because she was getting some
surgery today is she done with it yet or
I haven't heard an update from my life
but she's got a she's got a her back leg
her paw right some with her paw her
front paw has a little weird but it's
actually her back leg that is getting
the surgery it's it doesn't it's it's
like that joint isn't isn't lining up
correctly so yeah we need to make sure
she can keep running and playing so
everyone everyone say little little
prayer for nori yeah sure she'll be
she'll be fine that's a very nice place
that she that she's getting taken care
of at but she's a fighter she'll be good
again this jacket for tonight pair
players are apparently players are
paying up to $450 for discs big discs
face copies this is the title this
headline is players paying a porter than
50 for disk based copies of fortnight
who said it just fine Lucinda jar for me
so in case anyone wasn't aware for
tonight is very popular very popular
game you know for tonight is popular
because when Kyle and I played it when
we did the livestream that we just did
on Sunday and we played for at night
there
bunch of people like Fortin it sucks so
you know yeah on top because once somes
too popular it's big areas that there's
a groundswell of hatred for that by
people who are obviously too cool well I
wasn't gonna say that I was this a very
intelligent very intelligent discerning
individuals too intelligent veterans if
you are into fortnight's then maybe you
are into collectibles too and because
there was a brief period of time where
there were physical copies gearbox
software published a limited number of
physical disk copies a fortnight for
PlayStation 4 and Xbox one and PC but
only in Europe so if you're a PC player
apparently European physical copies of
the game this was alongside the games
paid early access release last July so
this was well before fortnight kind of
blew up when the free-to-play battle
royale mode was launched was which was
in September
these were $60 each when the games
actually came out and now they're
selling for significantly more than that
and the article they looked at recently
sold copies on eBay and found that if
you include everything new used and
sealed it was selling for an average of
130 bucks a me and a hundred and ten
dollars that's just over the past two
weeks so that means I imagine probably
used and you know damaged ones are
selling for less but probably even more
than that for the ones that are sealed
right now if you look at used copies on
Amazon from third-party sellers and a
minimum of a hundred and seventy five
dollars is what you have to pay for a
bare disc without the case Mike those
Amazon third-party sellers just
cutthroat Jesus cutthroat but more on
Amazon third-party sellers later in the
show did not realize that was gonna be
it's a call back but there it is the
theme for today that's insane
Aris Technica did ask if or tried to
find out if there would be a potential
rerelease of physical copies not that it
would matter because you know the real
collector's items would be the original
ones still but gearbox did not reply to
them at all and Epic Games said no plans
to announce right now so if you really
like fortnight
now if you have if you have like a
significant other a spouse who really
likes for tonight the ultimate gift a
$400 plus copy of the game that they
already have nothing says I love you
like buying the same game triple price I
actually feel bad for people who don't
know that you can buy fortnight or that
it's technically free online and who
just walk into a Game Stop and see like
a disc copy for a hundred and seventy
bucks and think just terrible price how
many don't realize that it's just the
disc only price I'm sure like there's
someone who's told like a mom or a
grandma or something or dad or grandpa
like oh I want this game and they go and
they see it and they just like buy it
and then the kid they get back home and
the kids playing it already you better
play this game no returns for difference
yeah okay benefit of hard copied hard
copy video okay moving along we have any
brief collection of stories all from
gamers Texas we stole them this is a
gamers and exes is we are gamers Nexus
Hardware news from three days ago and
haha Steve we are stealing we're
stealing these stories just a couple of
them though and we're not gonna go over
every single one because they were
interesting and they were all so
succinctly discussed here so Steve will
definitely come after come after us and
if Steve's us come after us as
previously mentioned slightly scary
stories were actually gathered by Kyle
so blame pat down fuck as the first one
is Nvidia has apparently over ordered
GPUs so NVIDIA has GPUs manufactured by
GPU manufacturing but by chip
manufacturing plants they ordered too
many apparently and one vendor
according to gamers Nexus has actually
began attempts to
and excess GPUs that have been purchased
this is a combination of them ordering
too many probably during the height of
the crystal mining craze and then some
vendors not being able to sell them and
possibly wanting to return chips back to
Nvidia as when we're talking about
vendors here we're talking about the
adding board partners that get the chips
and then integrate them onto onto the
boards to sell according to Steve a few
other sites heard similar news from
their own sources there's very
mysterious sources they're not named
directly in the article so obviously
they're not to be trusted
but digi times has also reported that
Adam board partners are expected to see
their shipments fall in the second half
of 2018 due to the waning cryptocurrency
markets so crypto not like not like
crypto is gone or anything but just
mining cryptocurrency with graphics
cards has started has dropped off a
decent amount in the past few months so
there's less cryptocurrency miners
buying those GPUs now here's the weird
part all shipments and profits I'm sorry
as shipments and profits shift downwards
so they're making less money and they're
shipping less GPUs due to the demand
shrinking prices are still suspects
suspected to remain high
why because everything you learned in
economics was wrong apparently it was
all lies
yeah so mr. Sinclair so how could you
supply as high that misinformation
demand has gone down prices is expected
to remain the same I don't I don't fully
understand that do you we could be
experiencing something similar to when
we had all the the crazy floods in
Thailand and the price of hard drive
spiked up and then they never after the
floods were gone the prices never really
went back to their normal previous state
they just realized that they could still
sell and make a profit off of hard
drives out of crazy high price so they
went down a little bit but they never
actually went back down
what they were before well anytime you
have an excuse to raise prices as a
manufacturer you're probably gonna want
to try to keep those prices high as long
as you can and whether they're doing
that you know legitimately or not is
always a question and there certainly
have been examples in the industry in
the past of that not being then legit
legitimately not that I know anything
about the hard drive thing that happened
never tell I'll never tell it doesn't
matter anyway this because Steve from
gamers Nexus has already spotted us and
we've already been caught red-handed he
said stop right there criminal scum damn
it Steve
while giving us five dollars in haha
he's also fallen for our trap joke's on
you and giving us money back we were
watching we're watching a gamers Texas
video right before the show went live
actually we should have more on that on
Kyle's half of the show indeed all right
let me let me let me moochmore from
Steve's work here yes No so what are you
saying here is that the profit margins
are still gonna stay around 20% which is
which is high compared to what it would
normally be in a normal market it's 10%
but still much lower than the 40 to 50%
profit margins we were seeing when all
the graphics cards were ridiculously
overpriced at the height of the mine
increase so I don't know I don't know if
there's some sort of like careful
measuring being done with the amount of
cards that are just sent to retailers to
sell to sort of get through this
transition between the high demand to
the lower demand phase but it's it's I
kind of have to wait and see because the
idea that NVIDIA has way too many GPUs
to sell especially if they're 10 series
GPUs which we're expecting a successor
to at some point this year then where
will those 10 series GPUs go like I have
to imagine that at some point there will
be a bunch of duty' X 10 80s for like
super cheap or you know the 1070 will
have
official price slashed or something like
that but you also have to remember it's
not just the GPUs it's the memory as
well and the memory has also caused have
been a significant factor in the higher
prices of graphics cards
so the RAM suppliers speaking Wow I'm
doing great segues here speaking of
memory yeah the next seamless next a
little bit we're stealing here from from
gamers and exes is that DRAM suppliers
we mentioned this like a month and a
half ago back when we used to do awesome
hardware Samsung SK Hynix and micron
which represent 90% of the DRAM market
could now be facing an tried antitrust
fines of up to 8 billion dollars in
China for price-fixing so China has a
price-fixing investigation going on
towards these manufacturers specifically
China is one I believe it's the largest
consumer of DRAM in the world when it
comes to a single market pretty sure
that's true
but yet you should mention that as the
high mark eight billion is the high
point if they if they found guilty
vendors face fines ranging from 800
million dollars up to eight billion
dollars which is a reasonable swing so
is this why DRAM so expensive right now
because of all the price-fixing I mean
it's a theory
90% of any but but again like we
mentioned before if a manufacturer has a
legitimate reason and there are
definitely legitimate reasons for prices
to go up based on output and demand and
a wealth of different factors but if
there is a reason for them to
legitimately increase the price of a
product you'll often find them finding
ways some better than others to maintain
that high price because if you can sell
the same product especially in
technology if you can sell the same
product this year for the same price or
more than you sold it for last year and
we've done no additional research and
developments and so like you know a new
version of that product or whatever I
mean all that aside then you're gonna
want to keep doing that sure it's like
oh we can you mean zpz you mean we can
produce less and make more
money and yf9 less people and have
ridiculously higher profit margins
yeah it's go ahead and keep doing that
so we'll see if that actually comes to
be it's it's an ongoing investigation by
China so we should all we should all be
entitled anyone who bought DRAM in the
last ten years should be entitled to
reimbursement I mean that's possible
just like just like the GTX 970 Fiasco
exactly same thing yeah I'll need an
extra half gig
this is an article from last week so
we'll go over it very quickly but Intel
CEO Brian krzanich has it sounds like he
butchered it but then it actually I
think that's like the perfect phonetic
zanuck pronunciation it's Brian he's
resigned yeah yeah why why did he resign
though he resigns because he had a past
consensual relationship with another
Intel employee was discovered and
violated Intel's non-fraternization
policy because if you are a high-ranking
executive at a company
you shouldn't bang people who are in
your line of command their line of
reporting line that's a which if you're
a CEO that's not that means everyone and
you're less smart people who work Intel
so there are of course no further
further juicy details about the about
the affair itself but we're going to
simulate it here for you a little lower
thirds reenactment Brian walked in at
12:05 p.m. but just liked me in a rover
like the secretary lying on the table
mr. brain process notice seems to be
that your processor was supposed to be
shrinking
everybody's point being he's gone
CFO Bob Swan has been assigned as
interim CEO until a permanent
replacement is found because I had
joined Intel in 1982 he became CEO in
2013 and he has overseen a pretty pretty
critical points in Intel's recent past
from 2013 where Intel was kind of like
just kind of had it good when it came to
competition in the cpu market and
they're like focusing on other things
they were transitioning to a data
centric business and evolving past the
PC segment but thankfully for all of us
who like to build our own computers and
like to do high-end stuff with them and
and actually need cpu horsepower like
the desktop has not gone anywhere people
continue to find uses for stuff that you
can't do on a laptop or a tablet and as
a results we see stuff like the the
resurgence of AMD this year and and it
is good but hopefully maybe this bit of
shake-up at the top of Intel might be an
additional kick in the pants not I feel
like they're beginning lots of kicks in
the pants over the past year year and a
half yeah and it would be nice to see
them refocused in certain areas and
given their response to AMD difficulties
with 10 nanometers stuff that I just
sort of assumed Intel had like in their
back pocket waiting for AMD to launch
something so they could be like oh
here's what we have that we've just been
sitting on because like a competition
haven't really seen any of that
it mostly seemed like Intel like
floundering with certain stuff like 10
nanometer and and all that so I just got
so side like what's the word just so
caught off-guard perhaps perhaps
complacent with their dominance in the
CPU markets and then maybe suddenly
decided oh we needed to diversify and go
into other areas those are the areas
because you know Intel have been the
chip King for so long you know maybe
aren't panning out quite as much for
them as they could have so there we go
you know Intel stock though since this
was news from five days ago let's take a
look at it right now this is the one
this is just today let's look
not the greatest can you tell when the
news broke
6:25 they were about summer 21st 21st
they were like having a great day they
had a nice bump right here and then like
news broke damn I mean it's not a new
CEO leaving yeah okay what's on the 21st
it's not a terrible drop-off same there
they were they peaked here at in the mid
54 range they've done a forty nine point
eight five as of the close of the market
today it's Betty bad I don't trade
stocks so I just I just lived away
alright let's move on
WPA three you guys use Wi-Fi right sure
of course by WPA to the best for now
wireless Wi-Fi security standard
actually has been around for a long time
it was introduced over a decade ago in
2004 during the George W Bush
administration I don't know what I seen
that needs to associate it with that but
whatever but the Wi-Fi Alliance has now
announced WPA three the protocol itself
has been finalized so the simplified
version is that new Wi-Fi routers will
come a stronger protections for the data
that flows between your computers phones
smart home devices and your internet
connection that's the that's that's
that's the laypersons explanation of it
but where does this information where
does this standard come from the Wi-Fi
Alliance the lines like I made up like a
fictional fictional group thing sounds
like the Wi-Fi Alliance that were taking
down the land Empire right away land
Empire and the Wi-Fi Alliance the
rebellious Wi-Fi Alliance the dark Wi-Fi
Lord I'm just making this up yep okay no
it's all real the Wi-Fi Alliance
controls the Wi-Fi certified logo so
pretty much any Wi-Fi device you have
has that Wi-Fi certified logo it it
confirms that it adheres to a set of
standards so that it will have inter
operated interoperability with other
Wi-Fi
certified stuff the Alliance itself is a
group of companies which includes 3com
arrow net which is acquired by Cisco
apparently this is this is from
Wikipedia by the way here is
semiconductor Lucent Nokia and simple
technologies which is now zebra
technologies also they have key sponsors
including some you may have heard of
Apple Comcast Samsung Sony LG Intel Dell
broadcast Broadcom Cisco Qualcomm
Motorola Microsoft Texas Instruments and
t-mobile I've never heard of any a
pretty significant group of
manufacturers obviously this is why
Wi-Fi is everywhere is because every
company that makes anything is part of
the Wi-Fi Alliance apparently the
benefits will be better protection
against certain hacking attacks against
your Wi-Fi connections such as the
offline dictionary based attack which
allows hackers to make endless guesses
at what your Wi-Fi password is or the
recent crack flaw that we discussed on
the live show last year in October by
the way if you weren't watching that
show and you're not familiar with crack
and you use Wi-Fi and you have a router
and you have not updated the firmware
for that router since say September
October of last year go update your
routers firmware because if you haven't
it's still susceptible to crack decay
yes now just because the standard has
been has been finalized it doesn't mean
that you can immediately buy products
based on that in fact manufacturers
usually wait until the products are till
these standards are finalized or at
least close to that before they start
bringing products to market I'm sure
there's a lot of manufacturers that have
stuff in developments but now that it's
been finalized they can actually start
bringing products to market but it's
probably gonna be a few months if not
like 2019 until you can actually
actually buy stuff with that native WPA
3 supports no information in the article
as to if it's going to be anything that
could be backwards compatible via a
software firmware update to existing
hardware I'm not going to speculate on
that right now maybe I guess ok I did
speculate I said maybe but in
decent chance you're gonna need new
hardware for this though so the point at
which you have WPA 3 encryption across
all of your Wi-Fi connected devices
including smart devices you might have
in the home or like if your cellphone
needs an update and your router needs an
update and your Wi-Fi you know your your
your cards and native Wi-Fi adapters and
your computers but yeah if we find out
more information on that in the future
we'll probably uh probably that you know
WPA 3 yay whoo more security if it's
better than two Security's good final
story here from the Supreme Court in the
United States yeah lots of stuff
discussed about the Supreme Court in the
United States but we're going to take a
fairly narrow view of just this one that
relates to technology oh good ok because
otherwise the inspector right but among
other things the Supreme Court has
recently been handed an a bunch of
decisions by a very familiar
five-to-four decision the Supreme Court
ruled on Thursday that's you have to pay
tax with your online purchases now this
was the case itself was South Dakota
versus Wayfair South Dakota I'm pretty
sure it has been charging tax or like if
any if if anyone in South Dakota buys
anything online from anywhere else you
have to charge them tax and the
difference here is is being charged tax
when you pay like at the retailer versus
buying something from say a third party
or a marketplace where maybe you didn't
know this you're supposed to keep track
of that yourself and then pay that text
yeah customers were generally supposed
to pay tax to the state themselves if
you were not charged by the merchants
prior to net but the vast majority did
not thirty-one states currently have
laws taxing internet sales so before now
businesses were required to collect
sales tax only when shipping products to
a state where they had a physical
for instance Kyle and I both used to
work at Newegg when we worked at Newegg
we couldn't do anything in Washington
because Washington had Nexus laws about
state sales tax and if Newegg did
anything that that gave them a physical
presence in Washington this is years ago
by the way things have changed right now
we've been away from the company for
quite a while but if knowing did
anything that was a that gave them a
physical presence in Washington
including sending us as workers on
Newegg TV to go up and cover like pax
pax prime used to be pax prime then
suddenly you legally have to charge
everyone in Washington sales tax when
they bought stuff at new way so that's
just an example so if you look at the
biggest online retailer right now Amazon
they have actually been charging the tax
nationwide for a while now I believe
they started doing that so that sometime
last year may be 2016 but Amazon's
marketplace items which represents a
third or more of their in total sales do
not charge tax so tracking laws I'm
saying so if you buy stuff from Amazon
an Amazon Marketplace seller right now
if you live in state a and you buy it
from this other state and it ships to
you and gets sent to you with no tax
charged that's going to be changing and
it's supposed to legally be changing for
pretty much any retail anywhere in the
US if you are in California and it sells
something in New Mexico wherever that
person is in New Mexico you need to
charge them at the point of sale for the
tax for their location and then remit
that money back to their states in the
future so some consumers are gonna have
to pay more taxes now for online sales
is what it boils down to which is why
this is phrased as a win for states
according to this article and yet if you
are if you have like a favorite retailer
that you like to buy from that's out of
state and you never have to pay tax
that's gonna be going away if you're in
the US do you buy from any websites that
don't charge tax not really because
either I usually like I actually kind of
avoid Amazon Marketplace sellers for the
most part I just I mean not always but
from time to time socially this I'm sure
there's some random stuff I bought that
didn't have tax but I don't usually seek
it out right and then usually most of my
online purchases are gonna or like
Amazon or I don't know like I've I
bought from like Sweetwater recently and
BMH adorama B&amp;amp;H and i'm not sure
new i just didn't pay attention i just
checked out yeah I think yeah I think
it's not something that I really give
much thought to but I'm pretty sure that
most places I shop online here in
California have have tax added right
right and check out guido says vnh photo
doesn't usually charge sales tax out of
outside of New York okay should make
sense I mean well if I haven't been
charged tax and check out in recent
years I have not been keeping tabs on
that like if if if we're taking the side
of the little guy as far as the consumer
I mean obviously if you're paying more
tax that's more money out of your pocket
so you know that might not be a good
thing for you but another thing to
consider is the REIT the online
retailers themselves because one of the
great things about the Internet is the
possible ability for a small company you
know to suddenly make it big because
they get popular on the internet if
you're a very small company without that
money resources tracking nationwide
sales and keeping track of tax
situations from for every place you
might sell to especially a place like
California where a tax varies from
County to County not just a statewide
amounts that's that's an may be a
significant extra amount of work for you
to do that hopefully there's software
solutions or online point-of-sale
solutions that can handle that for for
small businesses but something to
consider yeah all right that's pretty
much wraps it up for the story stories
I'm talking about today so we were going
to
over to the final segments which is QA
so you know it's not oh hello thirds for
each of these I'll start rattling some
off we've got one from bazinga bazinga X
$5 for Paul working on his mad face
my cat has a matter when she purrs
perhaps a matter faced her like the cat
makes a mad face
I guess spring whimpering apparently oh
it's like a pain and pleasure
combination there we go you've been
working on your mad face Paul knows yeah
well because I did man did an angry
video angry QA yeah like a little over a
week ago and well - did I think so yeah
I was so mad I didn't wanna look back
mad Paul makes Paul mad I remember
myself like that too much
yeah but last week like we're gonna we
were gonna talk about that but then like
a week went by and now we're like I
don't know are you gonna talk about that
and you're half not really I feel like
it's already old news type of thing and
yeah kind of a bit I don't want to give
it anymore but they I mean I had mixed
feelings about it afterwards
this was this is the issue that Jay was
tweeting about and stuff is some
information that went out about
youtubers at Computex and accusing us of
be basically charging any any vendor
that we went to and good coverage of
their their Busa their sweets like we
were we like forced them to pay us money
in order to do that which is absolute
garbage yeah I mean there was a I think
there was a very positive response from
from fans and stuff definitely um after
many of us sort of spoke out was like no
that's yes it was really nice to have
you guys on our side yes this part
thanks to any of you guys who there did
warder who did jump to our defense there
it helps it's it's you know you don't
always want to like start every single
video with like here's here's how I do
things and here's my like ethical
standards and here's what I do is okay
another laying everything everything all
the time not everyone sees the
not everyone knows that by default and
right and there's certainly and there
certainly are you know people who do
just do everything for money and charge
everything but I don't I don't know any
of them the people who I talk to and
interact with on YouTube are all good
people yeah okay so I'm at a $20 don't
catch you guys alive too often because
of work but always watch the recordings
hope copy text read you well and you
weren't as drunk as me during the event
no thank you Matt I usually save the
getting drunk part for after the event
I'm gonna get my shit done first and
then and then I can raise my face off
yeah that's a good pretty easy this year
but but yeah I that's I think that you
are indicating you were there at
Computex so that's cool I wonder if we
ran into you or he was just drunk while
we were at Computex that's also cool
glad you got got to catch this one live
man thanks Matt and Roush wire 5
Canadians
sup guys great seeing you again what
would be a good pairing with a used r9
270 so III can't say this that I've
looked at prices just recently or
anything but since since the quad-core
intel z' are like falling out of style
and being replaced by the six cores in
the sub sheet I used r9 270 like if you
can find something well priced as far as
a quad core like a 6600 K or a 6700 K or
something like that it's like a z170
like is you know slightly used if you
can find a good bargain on something
like that
I think that'd be a good pairing if you
want to buy used yeah yeah I think
that's cuz you're talking about an older
card already so yeah if you want to buy
something new then you know maybe look
at some of the AMD quad cores on a m4
you know because there's quite a few of
those that are pretty pretty well priced
as well Jason $12 and 34 cents one two
three four one two three four I spent 33
plus hours binging on past episodes
really damn thank you for the great show
duties do the shirts and hoodies on your
stores tend to shrink and/or run small
I'm a big
the hoodies at least the lightweight
hoodies I think we ran a little bit
small
yeah the tighter side little slimmer
maybe by one size up
you should always return if you need to
shirts are pretty normal I think like I
usually wear a large size t-shirt and
the large shirts on those doors are
pretty good for me they're not not too
tight or short or anything
and also just hang dry your clothes if
you're worried about them shrinking
putting them in the dryer
unlike warm heat or whatever will will
almost always shrink your clothes so I
like the dryer the dryer is really nice
and it sucks having to hang up your
clothes but it also sucks when your
clothes drink it does you feel fat I
would buy a larger shirt that you can
just put it like a like a cotton shirt
fresh out of the dryer like it's so so
nice true but then the dryer also fades
your colors fades the color on the shirt
whether it's black or yellow or white
whatever just gives people the
impression that you know you really
enjoy your clothing and that's you know
you like to you like to live your life
and not just keep everything in the
plastic packaging maybe I should cut
some holes in my shirt just to show my
loyalty to it that was what I was
suggesting okay thank you Jason thanks
Jason
Tom's brim Smith's 50 Norwegian Crona
finally back I missed you
Paul our six dollars and sixteen cents
enough to pull one hair from Kyle know
if not then pull it anyway no double no
no don't do that it's not enough Cal
doesn't seem doesn't seem down with it
that's not an instead of money you need
to pay Paul more no to pay people maybe
if you if you donate on Kyle's half then
he will feel better about it
yeah it's typically good advice to
donate to the person you want to screw
with like yeah not the person who's
doing the screwing what if I gave you
the $6 right now that made you think
about it but what about the 16 cents I
don't know if I have six dollars in cash
on me oh that's too bad
all right Tom's will have to
put that one off for arbitration mykola
vote a $10 donation just great to see
you two back thank you Michael it's
great to be back we like it we have no
we have no upcoming conflicts as from as
far as we know oh this is an awesome
name I want to say this I want to say
this name are you gonna chime it
Vignesh Vignesh Bala subra
balasubramanium balasubrahmanyam Bala
superin ballast uber nian
balasubrahmanyam Vignesh bow super die
Needham I think that might have been
close that might have been close all
right please check out my build I'm
paint my PC Cal it's been my dream to be
future this is my first personal build
learn from the best put his Twitter
there @viki 96 Kyle
I better go add that to you have the
show right now I've already picked out
all my pin my PC and trim carrots
Vignesh hangin sorry Vignesh she's got
the best last name ever I want to I will
get rid of that I can pronounce that I
wonder if that's tie or I have no idea
so I cut my favorite I have a Superman
so a long time ago when I when a a I
used to collect random names just like
at CNA no dick that's a really cool name
one of my favorite ones was drag august
ed ski ooh it sounds like an evil Bond
villain dragon if you're watching the
bag of like holy crap mr. Kerch $10
donation welcome back I can't imagine
spending $2,000 on a monitor I just got
a 27-inch 1440p hundred forty-four Hertz
IPS monitor made by M best on eBay for
$2.99 genuinely amazing amazing you
should check it out
sounds like a Korean panel may be
Canada's but use some pretty high
quality something else Korean panels if
you get a good one like with no dead
pixels or anything like that like just
just snaps alone can be pretty nice so
yeah Congrats on the good monitor and
that is a very nice set of features for
300 bucks
leo el premio with a 15 dollar donation
really missed you guys glad y'all are
back
H ativ - at the rear of a mess if I see
as intake with two front intake and top
two fans as exhaust any issues I can
fabricate I can fabricate a mich filter
for the rear a seminar decane of gtx970
you tell us yeah if the temperature
lookin find them the temps are fine I
mean I would be somewhat curious to see
that tested either way and just see
which one works better
I mean oftentimes it can depends on the
specific build and hardware use use and
others other configurations and even the
even where you have it like in your home
so sometimes the only way you can truly
know what's the better configuration is
to just actually test it yourself but I
would I would think you'd be fine with
that configuration and I would
definitely go for the added dust filter
you know the intake because those
filters are really nice I'll have my
reviews $5 hey guys well the Japan blogs
from both of you looking forward to
seeing the rest from Kyle Kyle you have
part two comin I do as soon as I get my
camera back that I left in oh I still
hasn't come back yet
yeah my cousin actually shipped it out
yesterday but she said that the the
people at the Japanese post office
wouldn't let her ship all the batteries
oh so they only let her ship the camera
and the bag the one battery that was
inside the camera along with the memory
card that has the rest of the footage to
edit part two of the blog so hopefully
after I get the camera back which should
be maybe within a week I can edit that
in a day post it on floatplane and then
it'll be on YouTube a week after that so
expect two to three weeks until part two
comes around it's gonna be very delayed
but it'll be good it'll be worth the
wait
cousin couldn't pony up for the two day
air huh well I told her to spend no more
than a hundred dollars on shipping Oh
so I don't know what that gets you in
Japan if that's like overnight status or
like this cuz that's it's a small small
point-and-shoot package such an a
hundred bucks should get it to you
pretty quick right or to the air with
that feeling so alright maybe one to two
weeks it'll be on YouTube you extended
the time
you said one week originally and then he
added another week no I said two to
three weeks didn't I I don't know that's
just NB 67 1337 super delete I really
like to Japan vlog as well as you calm
protects coverage Cheers
thank you thank you mister frantic Euler
I appreciate that I like all of your son
sunset shoreline photos that you tweet
those are always very those always very
pretty and the build that you recently
did in the damn case yeah that is sexy
as shit well then gamers Nexus this is
presumably from Steve yeah he donated
five dollars while we were talking about
how could you tell he said stop right
there criminal scum obviously Steve has
made a very serious accusation against
us we will not take this lightly no and
we'll discuss it further in Cal staff of
the show we'll be pursuing this to the
extent of the law we shall run but you
can't hide just know we're gamers Nexus
pup Shepard wags wags wags $5 donation I
hope you are well I am so close to a

special water cooled edition and good
luck best of luck to you Manny hope it

plug up all your cup all the oh the
potential holes before you actually yes
turn on the pump learn from my mistake
good
Jared Judd five dollars worth upgrading
from a fantasy evolve shifts to a lammle
pcq 37 for future water cooling the
evolved shift is that's the tower one
yeah the HTTP seat looking one what's
the cue 37 again as these are both mini
ITX aren't they how's my life I still
don't know maybe because we're streaming
oh this one yeah that's the little cute
37 I would personally stick with the
shift I just I don't it's it's like a
different style of case wholly different
but I think the internal layout of the
shift is more well executed being honest
then and the cute 37 like it's a it's
gorgeous but it's very pretty and it's
got the the brushed aluminum and
everything it's it's it's a good-looking
case but there's some definite there's
some trade-offs for it I like some of
the more recent stuff that Lee Anne Lee
has been doing so that would be my
suggestion

Pentium 3 what the hell should I do with

you're just it's it's very old it's the
power efficiencies just hanging on
really bad compared to current
generation stuff you know just sometimes
