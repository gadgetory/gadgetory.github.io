choosing a motherboard can be a daunting
task especially for first-time PC
builders even after you've figured out
the basics what socket type to get to
match your CPU what form factor the
motherboard should be to match your case
how many expansion slots and memory
slots and SATA MDOT to you dot 2 or USB
connection points you need there still
might be 10 plus options to consider
with varying quality features and
pricing so today I thought I would run
down my five favorite motherboard
features those extra useful ones the
bonus add-ons that might not even be
necessary for your computer to work but
are definitely worth paying a few extra
bucks for whether you're building an AMD
am 4 system or an Intel LGA 2066 or 1151
based PC or if you've got your sights
set on the upcoming thread Ripper
processors and that platform keep an eye
out for these fantastic motherboard
features so let's start with the basics
surface mounted power and reset buttons
these used to be a premium feature on
premium boards but then they became
pretty standard even on budget
motherboards but recently I found that
not all boards have them even some
higher-end options they come in a
variety of shapes and sizes as far as
the buttons themselves but all I really
care about is that they're physical
buttons they're at least somewhat well
labeled so you can tell which one is
which if you build outside a case you're
on a test bed these are going to let you
power your build on or reset it without
having to short a couple pins with the
screwdriver if the minor convenience yes
but if you're caught in a
troubleshooting loop they can really
help you out I've also had a case where
the power button is on the case died on
me and by unplugging the front panel
connectors from the motherboard and
reaching inside the chassis to use the
surface mounted power buttons I was able
to more quickly figure out what was
going wrong an LED post readout is
another feature that you'll find in a
lot of motherboards especially when you
get up out of the budget territory and
into the mid-range an LED post readout
does a few things when your PC first
boots it's going to cycle through a
bunch of codes as the system tests
everything on the motherboard to make
sure it's all working in connected
properly if there is a problem you can
watch that readout to see what it says
when the system hangs or resets itself
and then you can check the chart that
comes in the motherboard manual to see
what was happening when the error
occurred memory initialization error
maybe you've got a bad RAM stick or
maybe you use the wrong DIMM slots boot
device err maybe check the BIOS settings
for your SATA controller it won't always
be able to show you exactly what the
problem is but it will give you a lot
more to go on than just my PC won't boot
post LEDs will also often switch over to
displaying your CPU temperature once you
flewed it up which can be really handy
for an at-a-glance check of how hot
things are I just wish more motherboards
have the option to actually turn that
post led off after the system boots
because it can often clash with other
case lighting now if I had to choose a
number one feature on this list I think
it would be this the ability to update
your motherboards UEFI also known as the
bios without a CPU or memory installed
Asus originally introduced this feature
under their branded name USB BIOS
flashback and since then gigabyte has
also introduced it to some of their
motherboards they call it Q flash plus
just copy the new BIOS onto a USB Drive
plug it in and connect up power to the
board from your power supply and you can
update without a CPU or memory installed
updating your BIOS is a lot more common
than it used to be but if your power
goes out or someone kicks the AC cable
while the BIOS update is happening it
can brick your motherboard this feature
can allow you to recover a corrupt BIOS
or if you have a motherboard with an
older bios version like say you have a
z170 Intel board that originally only
supported skylake processors and then
you have a newer CPU like a kV like 7700
K which will only work with v 70 if you
update the BIOS you can get around in
this kind of catch-22 situation without
having to go and find and borrow a
skylake processor from someone just so
you can update your motherboard
here's another basic but vital button
that you don't always find even on
higher-end boards a clear CMOS button
positioned on the rear i/o Polly CMOS is
used to wipe your systems bios settings
by having it there it allows you to do
it without even having to get inside the
case kind of like power and reset
buttons clearing your CMOS can be
handled by shorting a couple pins on the
motherboard and with budget boards
that's usually how it works this is
inconvenient I mean even sometimes
super inconvenient there's parts
installed on top of that pin out that
block access to it making it a button is
upgrade one and then putting that button
on the rear i/o is upgrade to if you
want quick access without even having to
remove your cases side panel practically
speaking this will help you out most if
you're dabbling with overclocking if you
find you pushed your system too far and
you're not even seeing a display on
screen anymore
clearing CMOS will reset the system to
factory defaults and get you up and
running again four favorite feature
number five I wanted to single out
gigabytes new fan stop mode that some of
their ex $2.99 motherboards have it will
turn all of your system fans off if
temperatures are low enough to eliminate
fan noise but then I decided to expand
this to more generically recommend
advanced fan controls any decent
motherboard should allow you to set up a
custom fan speed curve based on system
temperatures and it should allow you to
do that from within the BIOS or from
within windows and some fans can also be
tied specifically to thermal step
sensors that might exist on the board or
CPU or GPU speed for pin fan headers on
the board allow you to connect either
three pin voltage controlled fans or
four pin PWM controlled fans and
including a dedicated fan header for a
pump it's nice to have as well software
can take fan control even further too
for example ASUS motherboards with fan
experts can run a safari so will be that
tests all the fans you have connected to
the motherboard headers and tune them
based on their minimum and maximum
rotation speed MSI and gigabyte also
have been developing their fan control
software for years they offer a ton of
customization options as well so those
are my five favorite motherboard
features and you might have noticed some
features that didn't make this list RGB
LEDs and/or RGB LED headers for example
can be nice to have aesthetically but I
still consider them to be optional and
ultimately a function over form kind of
guy still also some boards have a ton of
other surface mounted buttons aside from
the power and reset those allow you to
manually control overclocking functions
which I also typically don't look for as
you lose access to them once the board
is installed in a case for an open test
bed or a hardcore overclocker they can
be handy but that's a relatively small
group among all PC builders this was
just a 5 item list though so I'm sure I
missed some other excellent motherboard
features if you guys have a minute and
you want to post your own personal list
of favorite features
down in the comments I would be very
interested to see them thanks for
watching this video though guys as
always like share and subscribe if you
enjoyed it and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
