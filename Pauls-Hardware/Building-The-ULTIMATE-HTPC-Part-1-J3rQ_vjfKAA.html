excellent hey guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is going to be my
ultimate home theater PC build and I'm
actually getting into the process of
building today
I've been planning this for several
months at least and actually formally
started planning it about a month and a
half ago at least as far as announcing
it on the channel and it's been a bit of
a challenge actually to get up and
running because there's several things
that I want this home theater PC to be
able to do it needs to be able to
capture directly from a digital cable
service subscription which I have the
affront to your FiOS here it needs to be
able to play video games at high
resolution have a 4k TV here behind me
and it also needs to ideally be able to
play the newest games which means it
needs to be able to play DirectX 12
which means kind of needs Windows 10 at
least on the gaming part of the system
let me explain a little bit further
though I don't know if this is poetic
justice or what but this is my old
school Windows Media Center remote
control I've had this for years I feel
like this is at least ten years old
it's no longer working actually
completely dissemble disassembled it and
cleaned it up that's okay though I have
a replacement lined up my harmony 700
right here although I do not yet have
that configured so for the time being
we'll stick with the keyboard so
basically if you want to build your own
HTPC and you want to have it be a DVR
there's a couple ways to get the TV onto
the computer so you can watch it
one is over-the-air broadcasts and for
that you can get a relatively
inexpensive TV tuner card and pop it in
there get your over there broadcasts you
will be limited to what is available
over-the-air though so if you want to
take it a step further and go with a
cable connection you need to rent a
cable card from your cable service
provider sometimes they will charge your
rental fee like frontier charges me five
bucks a month for mine which I think
kind of sucks but so what you got to do
if you want to build your own thing and
compare that to like DVR rental prices
which are usually in the $15 a month
range and it's not terrible oh good my
air conditioner just turned up now the
cable tuner cards
the ones that are compatible with
CableCARD can actually be fairly
expensive and that's why I've been
hanging on to my seaton infinity v4 down
there for so long because it can
actually do for TV stations at once it's
got four tuners built into it but
seeding as a company has kind of gone
under it's still functional as far as
the website still works you can still
get support for their devices and
download drivers and everything but
they're not really in development
anymore there's also a lack of support
for them so in order to get this which
is the channel guide the electronic
programming guide to download on to your
HTPC the best and easiest and most fluid
and functional and doesn't cost any
money what way is this Windows Media
Center but Windows Media Center only
shipped for free with Windows 7 you pay
for it with Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 so
you can do that and use it that way as
well but again that negates my ability
to have Windows 10 on here and play
DirectX 12 games so therein lies my
dilemma so what I've decided to do in an
attempt to appease y'all because I asked
for feedback about a month a month and a
half ago on this you guys said that I
should ditch this system I should have a
single system and that's all he also
said I should wall-mounted I'm going to
get to that at some point as well so
I've decided that I'm going to ditch
that seaton infinity V TV tuner card
because the other option is to go
something by silicon dust HD home room
prime so I'm going to Robert a Fry's I'm
going to grab one of those HD homerun
friends I'm going to see if it plays
nice with my cable card if that all
works then I should be able to use flex
and flex is like a home theater PC
front-end that you can use to navigate
through your media and that kind of
thing that was actually the other option
I was looking into before I've made this
decision for what I'm going to do today
is there a software or some piece of
software I could install on my existing
home theater PC that I could set up to
cap to schedule recordings and
everything for the DVR but it's just
it's very challenging to find something
that is Windows 10 support and support
for the season infinite TV and can also
download that electronic programming
guide there are options to do it you can
sort of jump through some hoops to get
it to download the thing from IMDB
because I am TV has also taken TV
channel listings
but all this is to say I want something
that's a little bit simpler and that
works a little bit more
straightforwardly if that is a word so
I'm going to go with Plex
which I've used before it's a great
front-end and if you do have to pay a
subscription either five bucks a month
or 40 bucks a year to get the Plex past
subscription but that does have the
functionality to download the
programming guide should work with
Windows 10 I'll ditch Windows Media
Center and then that will also
theoretically allow me to build a system
that is just a single system rather than
having a dual system set up with an
older Windows 7 system doing all of the
capturing of the TV and then another
system that I actually used for gaming
anything is this will allow me to do
what you guys asked for originally
because you wanted me to do make it
right in base so I'm going to go with
that got them out of the board here to
the crosshair six hero from Asus because
that has the am-3 mounts on it which I'm
going to use for my family's cooler
which hasn't arrived yet but hopefully
soon and if I can get that system set up
and working with Plex Pass then I should
be able to dis stick that system
completely wall mount this get my VR and
everything set up and be good to go but
for now let's head to Fry's be a good
boy while I'm gone okay here he knows
I'm leaving so he's acting on all smiles
melancholy
the mill they sold that sort of thing
Hank desolate the Apple Center is it
fries ain't no genius bar that's for
sure
anyway I said I'll 4243 for TV tuner
cards this is all Apple stuff though I
think it might be over here all the rows
of empty shelves where they used to be
video cards all bought out by mining I
look they got a gtx 960 in stock right
here look at is even a pile of them I
must be pretty good
oh my god it seems that these like so
it's like 250 bucks MSRP price has been
remarkably helpful today
it's probably cuz it's like a Thursday
morning and no one is here all of the TV
tuner cards over in the actual PC area
we're not the ones I was looking for so
I asked them this over here in the a/v
section makes sense I've discovered it
thanks to Laurent here for Florence we
got the HD homerun prime so nice retail
box of course and I'm going to take it
out of the box once I get home but
thanks for your help Lauren and a
problem bit with Katie okay that's how
entering the impulsive dissection oh
look at all these things do that got a
grill covered in charcoal get your chart
pull up and rent Oh food good no resist
don't buy anything
hey can dare though can always use more
candid now I have an air compressor fine
sour patch kids what is this a primo
chill order six assists we have it I'm
going to head back home for the dogs and
try to drive safely this is what it's
like when I come home at all doctor been
by themselves for winces oh hey can you
yes I'm Dan yes okay okay people
naari stop barking pop it stop it
oh goodness
so here can move sometimes whoo they're
fast
the dogs have calmed down and I am now
successful in my robber tries to grab
this so cool the only real reason I'm
sticking with the crosshair 6 hero
motherboard right now is because of the
mounting thing that can accept am 3
mounts because I'm going to try to do it
passively cooled 1600 1600 X over here
that's not necessary for this so just
bear in mind I know I know there's a lot
of impracticality going on here and I
don't care so that is one in four yeah
this is like this is a crazy over killed
motherboard for this project in fact I
could easily use the the X 370 - F that
I just got but actually have two of
these so that's what I'm going to do
anyway beyond that I have of course the
rise in 1600 X CPU right here again this
one doesn't make the most sense because
if you were doing this practically
speaking you should just get a 1600
especially since I'm probably going to
be passively cooling this will hopefully
passively cooling this and making it I
might need to under clock it or
something like that so be much more
practical to go to 1600 but I'm going to
get a lot of use a lot more use out of
my 1600 because I've got both of them in
the 1600 I'm more likely to drop into
builds for people because it's a more
practical price to performance processor
so that's why I'm using net for now I'm
just sticking with the Wraith cooler
forints but I do have that passive
cooler coming in very soon
remembering I've got Corsair Vengeance
lpx which is a 3000 speed kit should
work just fine and it's low profile so
shouldn't conflict with that cooler once
it arrives for an SSD I just have an
Intel this is actually the same SSD that
has been doing a great job in my former
capture and streaming system I believe
it's an Intel 330
although I could totally be wrong about
that but until they did a really good
quality control and everything for the
SSD so I just want something I know is
going to last a long time and I'm pretty
sure this has a lot of life left in it
only 240 gig but it's just for the
operating system and I can add on
something later on to do mass storage
for games and DVR recordings I've got a
1080i I don't know which 1080 T I'm
actually going to use in the system yet
but for now I'm just using this so the
drivers install appropriately so there
it is oh I gotta grab a power supply too
but I'll grab one of those from the
garage there's my old keyboard it's look
it's missing the key right there I'm
going to replace this at some point too
but I'll have to search and find one
finally I'm going to be doing just like
I did last time I think and installing
everything just I'm just going to do it
right there and build an
outside-of-the-box system to get
everything up and running because I got
to make sure everything works before I
go on to the next phase which will
probably the next video covering this
project where I'm actually wall mounting
stuff but I'm not going to go to all the
trouble of setting that stuff up until I
know that this is going to work for the
purposes it wasn't it was designed for
so I'll be back hopefully in a few
minutes and show you guys how this is
all functioning
so after getting the base hardware setup
as far as CPU motherboard memory
graphics card power supply I of course
went through the software installation
so installing Windows 10 getting drivers
updated getting the graphics card driver
installed and then I was able to
actually move on with the the more
specific stuff to get in the HTTP see
setup so the HD homerun prime actually I
went ahead and did an unboxing up took
it out basically it comes with the unit
itself you get an Ethernet cable you get
an AC power adapter and you get a little
bit of documentation now this works
differently than my student infinity v4
in fact it is a network connected device
it's not meant to connect directly via
USB to the computer so all you do is
plug in the well your still plug in the
power last but you plug in coax cable to
your cable feed a network connection and
Ethernet cable here going over to my
router and then of course that cable
card fortunately my cable card is
already registered and set up with
frontiers so I was just able to plug it
in I didn't have to contact them and
then this is a device on the network the
nice thing about having it on the
network is that any device connected to
the network and there's various
applications and whatnot that you can
use to connect to it but like so any TV
or any computer that you I connected to
the network you could have reached out
and access the three tuners that are in
that and then use it to tune into cable
TV or whatever else you're watching for
HD homerun prime setup you just have to
go to a URL that they indicate you to go
to in the QuickStart guide and then from
that URL you can see the HD home our
prime is connected and there's some
additional functions you can access
there I'm not going to go through all
this but there's a couple ways to do
this now
silicon dust actually provides software
for the HD mmm prime and that will allow
you to do basic TV tuning and live TV
and by default out of the box you can do
I believe up to one day of programming
guides and then you can watch live TV
now you can actually pay silicon dust an
extra dollar amount per month to enhance
this software include DVR
functionalities and give you two weeks
Elektra electronic
arming guide download functionality
however since I already know I was going
to use plex you can actually use plex
instead of the silicon desk software
although with plex I did want the plex
pass to get things going and have access
to the higher level functions plex pass
is 5 bucks a month all that is to save
with HD homerun Prime I really just
pulled up that website verified that it
was working properly and then I went
directly over to the plex software plex
I downloaded got installed plex
as a two-part software because there is
a server-side software and right now
running the server software on this
machine once look like server software
said if you go ahead and install the
plex media player software and that will
allow you to it gives you a better UI
for accessing all the media has a
10-foot interface so you can set it up
on a TV or something like that so once
it's like software was all installed I
was able to go in there access the DVR
portal it is still in beta but it's been
working just fine for me so far and I
could go in and do the electronic permit
programming guide so at first actually
reached out to the tube TV tuners to
scan through all the channels and see
what was available and then it was even
a little bit fancier than Windows Media
Center has been as far as the electronic
programming guy goes based on the TV
channels that were detected it just
automatically looked and said ok here is
your cable service provider it happens
to be frontier files and then it plugged
that in and was able to get the
programming guide and of course you need
the programming guide in order to
schedule stuff and guys that is going to
have to wrap it up for this video I know
I'm not finished and this is definitely
going to be a multi-part video I
obviously have everything just sitting
out here I need to do the wall mount
thing I'm working on some ideas for that
X has some really cool ideas for that
but I'm not going to tell you guys about
those yet so that's coming soon I should
probably activate Windows that would be
a good idea have some more setup to do
with Plex and the remote control of
everything to make sure it can access it
from the couch I ordered a replacement
wyatt wireless keyboard with a trackball
to replace my existing one that's really
on its way out all that stuff is very
exciting and oh yeah I also got this
this like literally just arrived in the
mail so I'm going to see if I can
passively cool
I rise and see for you I'm probably
going to do a separate video on that
just to see if that's even possible for
anyone who wants to do it whether it's
for a gaming PC HT PC or otherwise but
guys thank you so much for watching this
video if the thumbs up button of course
if you enjoyed it subscribe because I've
got lots more on these projects coming
up very soon we'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
