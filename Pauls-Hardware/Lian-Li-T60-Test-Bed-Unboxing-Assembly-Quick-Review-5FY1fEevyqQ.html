back once again to Paul's hardware today
I'm going to be doing a quick unboxing
and overview of this open air testbed I
found myself recently being really fond
of open our test bed since I do a lot of
work with different computer parts and
configurations at work they're
incredibly useful because it makes it
really easy to swap parts in and out I'm
considering purchasing one for use here
in this room where I shoot videos and I
was looking at an HS PC the the text
station that they make which is awesome
and fantastic it's a little on the
pricey side when you consider that
there's there can be like 130 250 bucks
for the nicer ones but then I found this
one this is the T 60 specifically the T
60 B from Lian Li here it's called the
Pitts pitstop T 60 that's an ATX micro
ATX testbench so I'm going to go ahead
and take it all out of the box get it
all assembled and then I'll kind of come
back and give you guys some some of my
thoughts on this particular little test
bed
so there it is and there you have it my
new testbed which is currently outfitted
with the z7 motherboard where I'm doing
a bit of a bit of motherboard testing
but if CPU testing perhaps that's for a
different video as far as this testbed
goes I know these are just my initial
thoughts since I just got it assembled
I'm sorry I didn't show you the system
installation I had meant to record that
and I don't think it recorded properly
but the testbed itself has been doing
fantastic it's so much sturdier being
metal than a lot of like the acrylic and
plastic test beds that I've seen before
so you do get what you pay for a little
bit with that the price right now is I
don't know it's it's it seems good when
you compare it to like an HS PC but at
the same time looking at the metal
that's in there and since it's come flat
comes flat-pack that doesn't seem I
don't know it's I'm on the fence about
it but personally since I do have use of
this I've been pretty impressed with
this so far couple quirks about it
the Leanne Lee logo was on upside-down
when I first got it um I used the heat
hair heat gun I used a hairdryer and
kind of loosen the adhesive and pulled
it off and it's got a couple of plugs at
the back of it so you just flipped it
and put it back on them so it stayed
centered and everything and then apart
from that Liam Lee does sell some
accessories for this one that's my
probably my biggest issues it's a you
get front panel at the front of it here
alright he gets a power and reset button
but you don't get this front panel so
you don't get your USB or your front
panel audio which isn't a huge deal for
an open testbed they also sell a
at 240 millimeter radiator holder like a
bracket that you can install right here
as you can probably tell I've done a
quick installation of a radiator this is
a thermal take water 2.0 extreme I used
some sims it ties up here at the top and
some corks to kind of give it a little
bit of support right there and it's
actually been working great it's pushing
air straight across the rest of the
components on the board but yeah I guess
that's it for my click unboxing a quick
assembly a quick little overview of this
little test bed once again this has been
the pitstop T 60 specifically the T 60
beats all of this black version also
available in silver and red I believe if
you can find those colors available I
got this off a new egg where I think it
was 90 bucks at the time which seemed
somewhat reasonable to me again if you
really need a test fit then they got the
other thing is that from the pictures
you can't really see this little prop
stand thing here at the back I was kind
of disappointed when I saw that because
it seems like separate from this whole
unit which has a handle and everything
but I'm after making use of it it's
definitely good that it's there it keeps
it much more balanced and if you do need
better access like you can remove it
easily with the thumb screws to get like
at these screws for the power supply and
whatnot but that's that's that's it I
guess that's my first impressions of the
pitstop T 60 from LAN Li open air test
bed I'm sure you guys will be seeing
this in future videos but thanks for
watching this one check it out on new I
got the link in the description if you
enjoyed this video don't forget the like
button which is right down there I don't
forget to subscribe so you won't miss my
future videos that when I post them and
we'll see you all in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
