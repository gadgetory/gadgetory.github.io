long-awaited review of the new AMD
Radeon 7 graphics card which AMD sort of
announced the beginning of the year and
now we actually have it in our hands to
test now what I've been doing is running
a bunch of tests on the our TX 2080
because the question that you might have
in your head right now is Paul I've got
about 700 bucks to spend on a graphics
card should I buy the 2080 or the new
Radeon 7 this video should help you
decide today's video sponsored by
Squarespace click the sponsor link in
the description to save 10% off of your
Squarespace order or wait till the end
of the video to find out more this is an
interesting graphics card it was
somewhat unexpected AMD was expected to
announce a bunch of 7 nanometer stuff at
CES this year back in January which they
did but the next-generation architecture
for the GPUs that they're working on is
called Navi this is not a Navi based GPU
it is still using the Vega architecture
but they've shrunk it down to the 7
nanometer manufacturing process and what
that has done is provided them a lot
more space as you can see the previous
diarrhea for a Vega 64 was 495 square
millimeters versus the updated Radeon 7
GP u which is 331 square millimeters
that's provided them a lot more space to
put four stacks of HP m2 memory with 4
gigs on each stack giving you a total of
16 gigs of HP and 2 memory on this
graphics card that's a lot and actually
significantly more that you can get on
any consumer level graphics card whether
you're talking about HP M memory or
gddr5 or 5 X or 6 you might even argue
that it's too much memory for what
today's games actually use but AMD has
done their best to make a point that
games are using more and more memory
everyday and high resolutions use more
memory so you might actually be able to
make use of all that HP m - that's and
they're sort of pitching this as a cross
over production content creation card so
the HBM to memory might help you there
as well depending on the software they
use aim D also says that they have added
more thermal sensors integrated into the
GPU die itself so you can actually get
more accurate temperature reading in
fact they're basing their performance
boost functions like automatic
throttling of the GPU frequency on the
edge temperature versus the junction
temperature this also allows them to
throttle the fan speed so according to
their measurements they got about 2%
more performance by measuring the edge
temperature although the junction
temperatures they're listing here are us
significantly higher now I have already
gotten some feedback from some other
people I know who have tested this card
the temperatures might potentially be an
issue depending on the card we're still
waiting for more feedback on that but
that's gonna be one of the things I'm
testing immediately when I install this
here is what kind of temps we're getting
out of this card as for specs the Radeon
seven uses the Vega 20 GPU that's based
on the seven nanometer manufacturing
process as opposed to 14 nanometer has
thirteen point two billion transistors
in there but a shrunk down die size at
331 square millimeters you're gonna get
60 compute units compared to 64 that you
get with the Radeon Vegas 64 so even
though that is down and you're gonna get
fewer stream processors as a result 3840
versus 4096 you get much higher
frequency in fact the boost GPU clock is
at 1750 peak should be about 1800
megahertz out of the box and that's a
good 200 megahertz plus frequency boost
over the Vegas 64 this also means your
GPU compute performance is up to
fourteen point two teraflops you get 64
ops you get 16 gigs of HBM to memory
with the total memory bandwidth of one
terabyte per second and a 4096 bit
memory interface board powers only up
five watts to 300 Watts versus two Vega
64 295 I didn't do an unboxing video of
this when the unboxing embargo lifted
earlier this week but I already kind of
showed you guys this when I saw it at
CES for the first time but a quick
once-over of the card shows you that it
is a very minimal design very simple it
has a squared off metal shroud with a
nice bevel around the edge that shows a
little bit of an accents although you
have sort of a powder coating over most
of it so it's not too reflective 392
millimeter fans at the middle and a very
substantial thin stack array underneath
them and the fin stack actually raises
up on the sides here so when the fans
are spinning it's pushing air out across
those as well as down and over them
there been some tear downs done on this
card already there is a graphite pad
between the GPU itself and the HBM 2
stacks and the cooling solution it uses
10 millimeter flattened copper heat
pipes to help move some of the heat away
from the hotter areas of the card and it
has dual 8 pin PCI Express graphics
power connectors also of note is that
this card is not crossfire compatible so
you can't connect two of them up at the
same time for crossfire which is kind of
sad because I would have been sort of
interested to see what two of these did
versus like a 20 atti
also missing is a built-in bios which
which AMD has done on reference design
cards in the past so that's kind
said that it's not there but you can
still of course go in and adjust
everything using third-party software or
the AMD software as well the shroud
itself is also pretty easy to remove
especially if you compare it to the
founders edition cards from Nvidia and
finally for display outs you have three
full-sized DisplayPort as well as an
HDMI 2.0 also of note is that those are
all in a single row which means if you
did want a water cool this you could get
it down to a single slot solution so I
have waited long enough I am ready to
install this in the test bed and see how
it compares to the r-tx 2080 that's the
founders Edition by the way which I'm
comparing it to because it is literally
the only r-tx 2080 that I have that's
what we're going with stock out of the
box frequencies for both cards the
processor I'm using is the 9900 k-8 core
16 thread processor from Intel which is
running at 4.8 gigahertz the motherboard
is the asrock z3 90 tight sheet ultimate
for memory I have 16 gigs to a cake
sticks of g.skill Trident Zr GB memory
that's running at 3200 speed casa
latency 14 for my main operating system
drive I have a Samsung 970 pro 512 gig
nvme SSD and the CPU is being cooled by
a cooler master master liquid 360 are
316 millimeter radiator all in one
liquid cooler for some extra game
storage I have a SanDisk Ultra - one
terabyte SATA SSD everything is housed
in this lammle PC 0:11
air dynamic chassis the Devourer Edition
in whites is a 650 watt EVGA 80 plus
gold rated power supply powering
everything and I'm running everything in
this test system as you see it here with
the side panels on and everything in
order to get temperature measurements
with all that said though here are the
benchmarks actually let me install this
version so first off let's run through a
set of productivity tests and these were
run with spec view perf 13 this is a
popular CAD and cam visualization and
digital content creation test suite that
uses applications for that type of thing
starting with 3d studio max this is
version 6 and it's running at 1920 by
1080 here the r-tx 2080 starts out with
a pretty commanding lead and a score of
2 it and thirty seven point one fps
remember higher is better here the
Radeon seven comes in with 160 8.3 fps
when rendering this test next up is the
Katia test oh five and here I bumped
the resolution to 4k or 3840 by 2160
here the Radeon seven healthy lead with
a score of 150 9.5 fps and that outpaces
the r-tx 2080s score of 86 point to the
next test in the suite is creo 2 this is
also running at 4k 3840 by 2160 and here
the r-tx 2080 again takes the lead
without and 64 FPS average framerate the
Radeon 7 meanwhile has a score of a
hundred and 5.3 FPS and the final test I
ran from the sweetest Maya o 5 again
running at 4k 3840 by 2160 resolution
and here we are a little bit closer
between the two cards but the RT X 28 II
took the lead with 180 point 8 fps
compared to the Radeon 7s 159 point
eight so the Radeon 7 was only able to
win one out of these four tests moving
over to gaming tests and I'm starting
out with several synthetic tests from
the 3d mark Suites
starting with 3d mark firestrike ultra
which is a 4k test DirectX 11 and here
the Radeon 7 with a score of six
thousand six hundred and ninety seven
overall and that's due to the graphics
score of six thousand seven hundred and
ninety-two compared to the RT X twenty
eighty founders additions to score of
six thousand two hundred and forty five
next up is 3d mark time spy extreme
which is also a synthetic test this time
using DirectX 12 also running at 4k the
r-tx twenty eighty wins this time with
the score of five thousand one hundred
and fifty five that's beating out the
Radeon seven square 4376 with a graphics
score 4268 that is nine hundred points
behind the r-tx twenty eighty founders
Edition score can't quite tell why it's
not performing as well in the DirectX 12
test I was hoping to do some ray tracing
testing with the 3d mark portrayal tests
but unfortunately the drivers I have for
the Radeon seven aren't currently
compatible so it would not run I'll have
to save that for a future date but I was
able to run VR Mark blue room and there
we got a score of three thousand five
hundred and thirty seven for the r-tx
twenty eighty founders Edition that is
again a healthy nine hundred point lead
over the Radeon seven with a score of
twenty six thirty seven and a frame rate
at fifty seven point five so when it
comes to VR and this test at least the
r-tx twenty eighty has a healthy
advantage moving into some actual games
that I'm testing at 4k 3840 by 2160 as
well as 2560 by 1440 to get a couple
scores for each test
ashes of the singularity escalation
which is a directx12 test the r-tx 2080
founders edition wins once again with a
score of 63 point two average frames per
seconds the Radeon seven came in with
fifty three point three average FPS when
we look at 2560 by 1440 scores the
founders Edition wins once again was
sixty nine point eight a verge frames
per second compared to the Radeon 760
point seven next up is shadow of the
Tomb Raider this is also running in
DirectX 12 mode at 3840 by 2160 4k the
twenty eighty founders Edition wins just
by a little bit with forty seven FPS
versus the Radeon seven to forty five
fps and if we move it over to 2560 by
1440 the r-tx twenty eighty ones yet
again the score of 93 average FPS
compared to the Radeon sevens eighty two
we have disappointing results for the
Radeon seven once again in GTA 5 @ 4k
3840 by 2160 it scored 66 average FPS
compared to the RT x twenty eighty s 76
average FPS and at 2560 by 1440 the
Radeon seven manage 118 average FPS
compared to the RT x 28 es 139 the
Radeon seven did manage a win when it
comes to battlefield 5 I am running this
in DirectX 11 mode because I was having
some difficulties with DirectX 12 and I
needed to get two benchmarks runs so at
3840 by 2160 the radiance having got 69
average frames per second that's about 5
fps more than the r-tx 2080s
64 and then again at 2560 by 1440 we had
a hundred and seventeen average FPS for
the Radeon 7 computer the r-tx 2080s 107
and my final test here is overwatch at
4k 3840 by 2160 and this is at epic
settings we have 93 average FPS for the
RT x 2080
that is more than the Radeon 7s a ver
egde fps of 87 and then finally at 2560
by 1440 we have 175 FPS average for the
archie x 2080 165 average FPS for the
Radeon 7 one during what frequencies
these cards are running at the Radeon
seven has a base clock of 1400 a listed
boost clock of 1750 I found that on
average it was running at about 1800 or
1807 and it peaked at 1823 maximum
frequency
I didn't dive into overclocking for
today unfortunately I didn't have time
for that but that is compared to the RT
x 2080s frequencies of 1515 base 18
boost about 1905 on average and 1980
peak temperatures are what we need to
talk about next and what the Radeon
seven are weird in the reviewers guide
they list that there are a bunch of
different thermal sensors on the actual
die and they have they have what they're
calling edge sensor temperature reading
and Junction sensor temperature reading
and the junction sensor temperature
reading is much higher it also seems to
be what most third-party apps are
picking up so looking at hardware info
64 that I use pretty often I was seeing
GPU temperatures that would go up to 95
and then 100 and then all the way up to
like 111 maximum which is way too high
for a GPU temperature to be however if
we're talking about a GPU temperature
that were not used to seeing then maybe
that is okay if you look at the edge
temperature and that is what the Radeon
watt man utility was reading and showing
most prominently at least those
temperatures were much more reasonable I
was heading around 65 to 70 degrees
Celsius on average maybe peaking at 72
or 74 degrees at max went under a heavy
sustained load now since we don't have
any other seven nanometer GPUs to
compare this to we probably need to wait
for third-party monitoring application
developers to sort of catch up to the
technology that's built into the Radeon
seven for now I'm going to set that
aside I'm hoping that's that high of
temperature that we're seeing isn't
actually like comparable to an
old-school GPU temperature I think
that's just something else we need to
take into account now but that remains
to be seen the one thing that I am able
to test is just what it actually sounds
like when under peak load unfortunately
it sounds like this this is my informal
sound test it's just running time spy
ultra right now I will tell you that is
loud it's a bit louder than I would want
it to be especially for a card with a
massive cooling solution and compare
that to this when there is no load on
the GPU so unfortunately when compared
to the founders Edition r-tx 2080 and
especially when compared to aftermarket
coolers that I have tested this is a
loud card when under load that could
probably be mitigated by adjusting some
settings somewhere unfortunately the
follow up to that is that there are some
bugs going on with the software and the
Trivers so far I encountered a few
different issues including the game
freezing entirely while trying to test
shadow of the Tomb Raider I was able to
get it
to unfreeze and sort of restart the test
but then it would happen again I was
finally able to get it to work by
closing down wat man but then I didn't
have monitoring going on in the
background so that's not good I also had
a situation and overwatch where
everything just kind of turned blue I
have no explanation for that I didn't
really dive into it but it ended when I
closed the game and then my final
complaint I guess would also be going
back to wot man and that there are
different temperature readings there's
supposed to be a chart across the top
that you can scroll over to sort of see
your history and what frequencies were
there but that wasn't updating at all
and then there's different temperatures
so you can see the junction temperature
and the normal GPU temperature but then
further down there's another listing for
the junction temperature and the GPU
temperature and that's not the same as
what it says up above so the software
definitely still needs some work as well
here
so in closing you might be thinking to
yourself well it's not quite as fast as
the RT X 2080 for the most part but it
seems like it's cheaper to write it's
only 700 bucks compared to the founders
Edition RT X 2080 which is $800 however
there are RT X 2080s third-party add-in
board and manufacturer designs for it
which are selling and available right
now for 700 bucks so this really should
be an equal comparison of two GPUs at
the same price and unfortunately the
Radeon 7 just isn't stacking up to what
the RT X 2080 is currently able to offer
when it comes to both frame rates as
well as noise add to that that Nvidia
has recently opened the floodgates for
free sync monitors that can work with
g-sync GPUs and you also lose the former
advantage that Radeon cards have that
you could pair it up with a less
expensive free sync monitor that is no
longer the case because those free sync
monitors not also working with Nvidia
graphics cards so I think the Radeon 7
is gonna remain kind of a niche product
for people who really like Radeon
products I suppose and I think there are
going to be some edge cases some
specific use cases that actually make
use of tons of video memory that it will
be useful for when it comes to the
production side of things but since
those cases are kind of more niche and
more specific it's going to be up to you
to decide if it works for you if it
happens to be better at the certain
games that you want to play or if those
specific applications that you want to
use speaking of applications you might
want to use I have been using

for watching this video I hope you've
enjoyed it and learned a little bit more
about the Radeon seven disciplines for
NVIDIA when it comes to the high end
graphics card space really would have
been cool if they had included crossfire
though like a 2-way set situation with
one of these might have actually been
somewhat interesting that's all the time
