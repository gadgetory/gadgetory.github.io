computer to take to CES in January
that's both portable and powerful I'm
doing it again for the third year in the
row and continuing the use of this case
right here the often sought after
Corsair 380 t it's discontinued but
people still like it and it still gets
used and every time I do this build
people are like let me have that case
but other than the case I have a very
powerful system set up here we're using
the 2700 X we have an r/t X 20 80 TI
this is what Joe is gonna be editing on
as we bring you CES coverage for the
following week I'm gonna go over the
parts here but first I wanted to look
back at the past couple years two years
ago when I first built this system in a
mini ITX form factor I was able to put
in a 6700 K a quad core eight thread CPU
and I also paired that with a gtx 1070
the next year I did to the core i7 8700
K which is six cores and twelve threads
this year I have the option of either
the 2700 X from AMD or the 9900 K from
Intel both of them have eight cores and
16 threads I would have gone with the
Intel but I'm actually kind of using
that in the system back here more on
that in a future video
so for today I'm with the 2700 X let's
take a look at the rest of the parts I
love having all the parts arrayed for
your fresh new builds but again we are
starting with the risin 7 2,700 x8 core
16 thread CPU from AMD and of course
there's gonna be people who are like oh
the 9900 K would have done you better
trust me guys I was really close to
using that but it is in use and I need
it for the next couple of days and this
system needs to get set up so it's ready
to go for on the road so nothing wrong
with this at all eight cores 16 threads
plenty of processing power for rendering
our videos and also the retail box for
it still which is nice you're gonna pair
that with the B 450 I horas Pro Wi-Fi
from gigabytes which is a very nice
full-featured mini ITX motherboard which
has an MDOT 2 slot as well as a pretty
cool look to it with some silver heat
sinks going on if you have a 20 80 TI to
use you should probably use it so that's
what I'm doing with the gigabyte geforce
r-tx 2080 TI this is the gaming OC 11g
which does come manufacturer overclocked
and it's also got a three fan cooling
solution also not terribly huge as
graphics cards go which is nice since we
are building in a somewhat more limited
space for a power supply we have the
cooler master v6 50 80 plus gold pretty
small power supply
all black cables so it's been a solved
one I've used it multiple builds in the
past for a cool roof got the hyper 212
black edition I was going to go with a
water cooler in here but I want to keep
things simple and with an air cooler
there's just zero chance of anything
failing apart from maybe a fan but even
if that happens we can swap that out
pretty easily from memory I have two
sticks of course their vengeance RGB
these are 16 gigs per dims so we're
gonna have 32 gigs total funny story I
only have 10 16 gig dim ddr4 sticks
they're all in Riptide so I actually
stole these two from Riptide these are
part of 828 gig kit but they'll work for
us in a pinch and I won't need Riptide
since we'll be on the road so that's our
memory and finally for storage we're
going all solid-state no spinning
mechanical hard drives here we have a
960 pro 512 gig for our main operating
system drive and then we've got a 1
terabyte SanDisk Ultra 2 and a 2
terabyte crucial em X 500 so 3 terabytes
of raw SSD storage space plus 500 gigs
for operating system and programs so
those are the parts we're working with
today I think this is going to be a
pretty awesome and portable build so
let's get started putting everything
together
my recent bathroom remodel has
reinforced that you should always double
check that things fit before you go
ahead with proceeding as as if it will
and a double checked if this will fit
and it won't so I need to switch to
something else I'd rather not try to
wedge in a water cooler in here for the
same reasons I talked about at the
beginning of this video but we used the
cryo rig h7 in the past I have an h7
quad Lumi here the quad Lumia is updated
to be compatible with a m4 so gonna be
removing the hyper 212 back black
swapping this in and then I think we're
gonna get a little fancy too and add
some Noctua NF a 12 X 25 pwm fans as
well so I was hoping to have to go
through three different aftermarket
coolers in this build not really but
what we have also discovered is that the
h7 is also just a little bit too tall to
fit in here I think this is because the
a m4 socket itself is a little bit
higher up than the LG a socket that
Intel uses and that's what we've used
the past couple years Intel CPUs so not
enough clearance I am breaking down and
switching to a liquid cooler that's
gonna be the inner max local fusion 240
right here which I chose because this
case only accepts a 240 millimeter
radiator all in one liquid cooler and it
was the first one that I grabbed that
was the right size and I've already done
a test fit here and yes this should fit
and have enough room for the actual
cooler to get over to the socket and I'm
still going to use not too advanced
I was not expecting this build to get
this complicated but 200 millimeter fan
here from NZXT has a non standard 200
millimeter mounting points so can't
mount that the only other Turner
millimeter fan I have is this thermal
take ring 20 which is a very nice 200
millimeter fan but it's also RGB and
thermal takes RGB fans have a single
plug so you can't just be like I don't
care about the RGB I want to plug this
fan and just have it work you have to
use this controller box controller box
requires its own power connection to the
power supply requires a USB connection
the motherboard and then and then you
can plug your fan into that I'm
regretting this decision already but
I've already made it so we're pressing
forward to install our tuner millimeter
fan up here in the front remember what I
just said about we're getting this
decision already all right we're
switching back to a 140 up here that's
it's not worth the effort all right I
put a Corsair light loop in there
fortunately these have separate plugs so
I'm just gonna be plugging in the fan
power not the RGB since I don't want to
bother installing an RGB controller in
there once I get this motherboard
installed it's gonna be difficult to
reach a lot of the plugs on so I want to
do the plugging as I put it in and while
it's out here and loose so I'm also
gonna be mounting the cooler on top of
that but I have four fans in this case
two on the radiator for the CPU on one
the front intake and the rear exhaust
front had taken the rear exhaust I'm
gonna wire up to the fan controller on
the case and that's just got a separate
SATA power that will power both of those
the two fans for the radiator I've put a
little fan splitter on so those can both
plug right into the CPU fan header then
there's one more plug here and that's
for the inline pump on the cooler and
that will plug into the extra fan head
around the motherboard of which there
are one which is right down here
and with the graphics card installed I
believe everything is good to go with
the system so I have plugged it in the
power I've switched on the switch we
have some memory that's lit up so there
you have it guys the CES 2019 build is
completes of course we need to get
windows loaded up and get all the
software set up but fortunately for now
the system is working so we can proceed
with that guys I'm so excited to bring
you CES coverage this year in 2019 so if
you're excited to leave a thumbs up on
this video and if there's any products
coming out soon that you think might be
launching at CES leave me a comment in
the comment section below and let me
know what you think that might be and
maybe I'll try to cover it next week
from Las Vegas Nevada thanks again for
watching this video guys
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
