you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master what's up guys and welcome
to my final CES 2019 video this one's
gonna be a little different I'm gonna
give you some behind the scenes it's
just gonna be using my old camera here
to record stuff I wanted to show you
where the sausage is made and then we've
got a few plans to run around today and
meet up with some friends and stuff so I
thought I'd take you guys along for the
ride for that - starting off with the
room tour
there's our bathroom not a whole lot to
see there over here is where we have the
important stuff cooler of course for
water and some beers there's my luggage
we are staying at the Palazzo this year
which is absolutely awesome
part of the reason is that it's very
conveniently located the other part is
that it's a huge room we have two tiers
we've got a couch down there we've got
plenty of space to set up for the
computer editing area over here for some
shooting of additional videos Joe's
working hard in the corner there we got
our own individual beds camera gear and
stuff right there this pile of trash was
a lot worse yesterday but they made up
the room for us oh there's Joe's chonies
don't take two closer look at those
can't say how nice it is just I have a
couch to sit down and relax on after a
long day of work and I just finished
shooting the last actual official CES
video right here
protip don't get a full breakfast right
as you're trying to make a thumbnail and
upload a video because that could
distract you and then you won't finish
your breakfast Joe has been wearing the
same outfit the entire week is that what
you yeah I just carry a bunch of
underwear and socks here just what you
have nowhere so that's fine right yeah
that's all you need
here's our little mini editing rig this
has been doing such an awesome job this
entire week we had only one minor issue
with it and we're pretty positive that
was an Adobe software issue but Joe
managed to figure out how to fix that
it's just this done a great job good job
AMD with the 2,700 X since the 20 atti
has also been doing a fine job because
when Joe finishes editing or catches up
he's been playing a lot of fortnight he
was up till 2:00 a.m. playing for
tonight 3:00 a.m. see the truth comes
out now that he's on camera about this -
like it's gonna make any difference in
our whatever you deserve the fun text
for today oh yeah it's different family
60-hertz Joe's just gonna have to get
like an Acer predator X 34 or equivalent
now because because he's played on a
hundred Hertz g-sync monitor there
hello I've synced up with Kyle we're
gonna give his near minute inspection
wait his Chris hey Chris how's it going
we're just just checking the robot now
they've had four people in here so oh
geez we've had poor people for four
people say oh I don't know how much I
don't know how much you're paying your
employees I don't want to make any
assumptions but look our very similar
setup actually but Kyle has actually
been using his room to build computers
yes like this one right here so gotta
check out that build yeah let me fantex
p600 s yes dad is very very reflective
that tempered glass that Duke missin
bein a very silvery you got the vertical
GPU Matt not neutral tones in there
excellent well done
all right let's what are we doing next
we're going to the show floor and I'm
gonna put you on bit Witter knew it ask
you awesome that's I was so excited I
couldn't even say an actual word the
pressure was already off
back at the convention center but we're
supposed to meet up here for bit Witter
nitwit
I have to pee where and where Kyle is
gonna pee all of me everything that's
pretty much the premise of this I guess
I'm gonna have two cameras pointed at me
at least I can do is point my camera at
them before they pointed at me
so I lost they were too knew it I lost
them what should have been a very simple
question to answer which is the
resolution of 8k monitor times three and
I was trying to figure out in my head
the number of pixels based some memory
and then I really should have been able
to just do
to figure out 3840 by 2160 four thousand
times 2000 is eight thousand eight
thousand times
four and then that times three I should
be able to figure that out pressure got
to me Kyle with his tricky questions
yeah see how Luke does so you're a ready
to do this yeah like really scared I was
too alive like Johnny vinegar but I got
that I got all the questions right set
the bar questions no I now he knows same
question you say aggression I feel so
much better now I feel so much
so look thoughts thoughts on being a
participant in a bit later nitwit
celebrity edition I got I got about as
destroyed as I expected I would I
haven't like been making content for a
while so I've been out of the loop for a
bit what's your Excuse I felt it I my
excuses that you tricked me
oh wow I have an ion theory though I
think Luke is just so nice he purposely
like bomb the question this is what
everyone thinks comedians are nice
you're like screw things up they're just
like all they were just being famous
because they were being it's so good for
you yes late sale Steve does a new
challenger here's hey Steve were you
expecting about me to walk up and blog
read your face oh you're wrong
thieves already talking I can't
Steve are you expecting this to be an
unprecedented three-way tie is that what
it was I think it was officially yeah
like you guys actually technically
struck out all the second yeah see you
the next one we finish a bit later
nitwit we are now in search of the
impossible burger which I don't think we
have much luck finding is it's
impossible probably impossible to find
why are you guys so confident that we're
gonna find the impossible burger maybe
we should try to find the potential
burger and wifey sauce finds vegan CES
Heather has accomplished the impossible
by finding the impossible burger she's
running ahead my friends told me I would
never get married
so had theirs done the impossible before
completely lost I'm very excited we all
do like a taste that's the same time to
get it yeah yeah a little sniff sniff
sniff get in there it's like Thousand
Island tomato lettuce plant-based and
then they put more plants in there to
keep it keep it company and the patty
actually looks pretty believable too
yeah yeah
got some raised eyebrows first one is
now gluten-free so before they made it
what you eat protein now it's soy which
soy gives it that more like meaty kind
of like pressure you can kind of just
see how it rips apart
I don't know that probably isn't heaven
I love this cameras auto mode it's like
oh I'll just automatically switch into
macro mode for you I see you something
close not a tasty burger slider sorry
it's got a kind of a meaty flavor the
texture and I think it's quite good guys
impossible burger 2.0 50% less humans
it's the year of the pig
that pigs rich that's a rich Pig right
there I think you got a lot of money
hey you're not a pig it's theater the
pig nothing here the Tiger what are you
doing here just use the pigs back up I
guess okay so these degenerates are just
down here gambling obviously obviously
they have no morals or ethics or there's
one by betting against myself oh I gotta
get in on that but I've been stuck in
the roof for a week Joe's first time
outside this entire time we've been in
Vegas
I have happen to copy text there's been
like my three days of four days

Walgreens Vegas walk-in refrigerator for
