a sort of random Paul Sartre video what
you were supposed to be seeing today was
my April build I was going to put it
together I was actually going to do it
lies but when I was setting up up here
to do a live stream this morning I came
across a big problem which is basically
one of my to Panasonic Lumix gh4 cameras
can no longer output via HDMI it's like
such a small problem but also such a
huge problem and basically it means I
wasn't able to do that video today so
instead I'm taking you guys along for
the ride as I try to cope with this
issue and hopefully get a replacement
lined up I'm like actually somewhat
proud of the configuration that I have
set up out here in my garage to do
things like live streaming computer
build especially to do that all like by
myself because that's usually all I have
is me when I'm filming something or
whatever so this camera I will have
connected with a AC adapter so that the
battery can't yell out and then also an
HDMI connector which is this little
adapter if they're the plugs in right
over there and then long bits of cable
which typically goes like up and over in
this this big messy area up here and
then runs down over to my actual
streaming system which is over there in
the corner which actually does a really
good job and have a couple capture cards
set up for that one external raised one
right here as well it was an internal
one and those capture via 1080 and they
allow me to get a little old
configuration setup over here with like
a keyboard so i can switch between
scenes and everything and then my second
camera i will you typically have mounted
to that mounts right there pointing
straight down so I can get a top-down
view of what I'm doing and then the same
kind of configuration I'll have a AC
power brick coming from this line over
there to keep everything powered and
then another hdmi cable that gets traced
over there and connected back up to the
streaming system and then of course I've
got my soundboard right there which also
has an XLR that goes over so this will
Mike hanging down can actually pick up
my voices I'm talking and saying the
things that I'm doing and it was all
going to be great it was all going to be
perfect as the build setup I got
340 you got my rise in five 1600 X right
there ready to go in this is only going
to be about a thousand dollar bill this
was actually the last piece I was
waiting for right here to the asus prime
be 350 plus motherboard so i was excited
because that arai actually arrived just
this morning as I cool I can do this
today and then and then I was plugging
in this camera and basically it wasn't
working whenever i plug in the gh4 the
way that I know that it's actually
outputting a signal is if the screen is
on and then you plug in the hdmi the
screen will turn off for a second and
then come back on that's always my
signal that like hey the camera is
trying to output via that via to be a
1080p of hdmi port that's down here now
the problem here is that it's a micro
port micro HDMI which is not the best
port it's just not that sturdy it's
meant to be small small not necessarily
sturdy so I'm not sure how well you guys
can see this in there basically if you
look at that Center bridge and the main
thing in the middle of the plug there's
gold contact leaves that come up they
are on either side of that and on the
top side from our perspective right here
there are two of those leads that got
kind of pushed back so that this is a
dental pick I'm using to point this out
but you can kind of see the two upper
channels here and here where the lead
isn't there anymore because it get
pushed back into the plug and this was
purely the result of me plugging in and
I'm plugging this over at the time over
the past couple of years that I've had
this gh4 so basically I am now able to
still use this camera for camera
functions like taking pictures and
taking video I mean there's nothing
wrong with the lens or the or the sensor
or anything like that there's nothing
wrong with the SD card reader it's still
perfectly functional as a camera however
because of what I do and because it so
often involves using the hdmi out on
this camera to to do live streaming or
that kind of thing I really need that to
work so here's what I've decided first
off thanks to all the people who gave me
some suggestions on Twitter because that
was the first thing i did when i
discovered this of course was go on
twitter and complain about it happening
has lots of good suggestions some people
were saying to get a lock port or one of
these specialized adapters there's cages
you can get they go ray I do have a cage
that goes around the camera then ones
that specifically go and hold on to the
plugs here for your HDMI adapters just
to keep them from what going around or
moving in that kind of thing and while
I've always been very careful with this
port and plugging it in and keeping the
plugs that go into it in mobile as much
as I can and everything and definitely
considering getting one of those
adapters however to actually solve my
problem I would either have to replace
this camera or have it fixed I attempted
briefly to fix it with that with that
pic that you can see but honestly those
leads are way too done in there
basically what it would need to be done
to repair this camera is disassembling
it removing the actual hdmi plug
whatever assembly that's that's part of
whether or not it's soldered to a PCB in
there i am not sure and then resolder
incredibly a new plug down onto their
that's fixed because I'm already very
invested into this platform as far as a
panasonic gh4 goes since i do have two
of these cameras it's why about the
second one was so i could do clean hdmi
out on both of them but i do have like
some some lenses i also have the EF
mount adapter for the micro four-thirds
mount so i can use my EF lenses that
with this also have like spare batteries
that fit in here and oh and the AC
adapters as well so I pretty much
narrowed down my choices to like I ruled
out like getting a sony a7s or something
like that I was considering it but I
think I should stay with them what I
have all of the kit for could get
another gh4 you can get those four and
the 912 hundred dollar range depending
on where you're buying it from and if
it's new and how shady they are they
also have the g 85 which or I think two
g84 is a JT for g85 I'm not sure they
have one of those that one's kind of
interesting but it actually doesn't have
quite as good quality for the HTML and
am still theoretically interested in
capturing via the hdmi at a higher bit
rates and a higher color depth so what
I've decided is to just bite the bullet
and grab myself a gh5 the successor to
the gh4 released fairly recently
benefits there
I mean this is a default side-by-side
comparison but the benefits are going to
be it's got a full-size HDMI out over on
the side on the gh5 that is so that's
nice i'm probably i'm going to get one
of those adapters for it to try to
preserve that plug as long as possible
it's also got a better sensor I do
believe it is a bit higher megapixel
quantity on this on the new sensor for
the GH five it also doesn't have the 4k
crop like the gh4 has whenever you
switch to 4k mode it actually doesn't
use the full sensor and it can also do
some higher resolutions it can do like
4k 60fps and higher bit rates and stuff
so all that stuff in there is enough to
convince me that hey I'll give the GH
five to try but after deciding that the
next question was where am I going to
get to GH five and it's really hard to
find it sold out like everywhere it so
that I knew I gets filled out on Amazon
unless you want to wait like two weeks
Richard ship sold that on B&amp;amp;H but I did
find it at bestbuy so I was going to
order Don best might have a shift but
you know I found actually a local best
but it has supposedly a couple of them
in stock so let's do a road trip let's
go to best buy for the first time in
like over 10 years this quick update I'm
driving now ready
I have made it here there are actually
lots of Best Buy's can near me but the
only one I was able to find stock for
the GH five this one which is in frickin
norwalk good 45 minute drive and I'm
going to go inside
cameras
look
okay one more quick update i actually
went to the wrong best site so i have
made my purchase and i gave me this pink
piece of paper and our seat and now i am
I came from norwalk County where they
actually have the genes that I'll get
success okay the hummus and I'm back
home and here it is the GH five retail
box freshly purchased from best buy for
a move on for today and start working on
some of the other projects that I keep
telling people I'm working on but still
haven't finished I'm going to do a quick
little unboxing of the new camera and
you Jess at least a quick look this is
not going to be anything official as far
as like listing up all the sex and that
kind of thing I do have a couple links
that i'll post or at least one link i'll
post in the video to a a more
full-featured review of this camera as
that's actually something that you're in
if she somehow came to watch this video
thinking it was going to be more about
the gh4 and less about just me dealing
with some production issues today but
here's the instead of the box we have
the shoulder strap which i will not be
using most likely we have camera body
which is in a little pouch and so i'll
come back to that that's kind of the
main event here we have oh good another
power charger innovation i'm getting a
look I get another battery i get another
battery charger dock and another cable
for that so it's kind of convenient also
we have a USB cable here the GH five
does have USB type-c and instead of just
the crappy USB so they gave me an
adapter kit for that that's just night
the cool guy only
I'm not really sure what this is looks
like it mounts on there somewhere the
hope is this a clot if this is like a
clasp to hold in cables that would be
pretty funny maybe I'm not the first one
who has damaged my gh4 in such a way hey
a new battery these are nice I do love
the battery life on the gh4 hopeful ugh
x is going to be similar because that's
one of the really nice features about it
especially especially if you're taking
on the road or something like that
finally the body itself and I did get
the body only because that's all I
really needed and this was two thousand
dollars which is pretty much what you
got paid for it retail right now since
it is a new camera so here we got the
Micro Four Thirds sensor in there
although it does have a higher megapixel
rating than the one that's on the gh4
the body itself is a little bit larger
but that's can it you can kind of see
that see see the grip is a little bit
larger on this one and whatnot they did
move the actual record button for keV
recording video up here whereas on the
gh4 it's back here other than that the
layouts pretty much the same which is
cool because I'm very very comfortable
with accessing the controls on the gh4
like easily switching between focus
modes which is pretty much in the same
place right there oh they have a little
a little jog controller right there a
little joystick to navigate the menus
that might be helpful the screen does
still flip out they have improved the
LCD screen it's got a its got a better
pixels per inch count on their solo LED
touchscreen they can sit more menu items
on each one and then of course the gold
selling feature for me right here look
at that full-size full-size HDMI and USB
type-c sweet full-size HDMI still not
the most sturdiest connector but much
more sturdy than the micro and since
I'll hopefully have learned my lesson
from this little experience I do plan to
get one of the little mounts on there
Scott's still has a separate input jack
so you got separate connectors for Mike
as well as headphones so you can have
external audio recording directly to it
obviously there are many other features
to this
numerous a very nice pretty high-end
mirrorless micro four thirds camera and
I'm looking forward to getting some use
out of it so i'll hopefully come back at
some point and give you guys a little
bit more feedback as far as my
experience with the GH five but for now
i should be able to get back up and
running and hopefully even set this up
to do that build that i have been
promising because i need to get that
thing put together after wrap it up at
this one no guys so if you did happen to
enjoy it i know it's not the normal type
of video that i usually do but go ahead
and leave me a thumbs up or comments
down in the comments section and i'll be
back with more actual technology videos
about computers and horizon and
overclocking and all that good stuff
very soon thanks again for watching and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
