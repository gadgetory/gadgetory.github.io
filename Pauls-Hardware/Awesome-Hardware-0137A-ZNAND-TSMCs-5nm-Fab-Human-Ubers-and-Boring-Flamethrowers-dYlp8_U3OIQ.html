don't see anyone in shaft
they just doable trick says of streaming
you to the happenin stream to like the
wrong the wrong one let's see here
no not that goes yeah you're right I
just nice chat broken its YouTube chat I
don't know where's you dream into
YouTube usually there will be that one
dude who like pops in quick there's
people there cell cells here there's
people okay okay hi everyone who we were
briefly concerned that you that YouTube
chat was dead or something everyone was
just tired okay and it's also probably
because I only just set the the stream
to right it's a public thanks wildly
trickling it's been set to unlisted for
special I'm so that should be fixed
there she blows
how can you do a quick intro so I can
course I can oh shut up shut up shut up
alright things and that's my beautiful
dressed me Paul I can immediately take
off all attention from you that is a
standard for the show that is my
specialty so this is a tech news show in
case you guys didn't know that Paul and
I stream to twitch and YouTube every
single Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
Astrix on the 530 sometimes we start
much later than that yeah today we're
not too late
no 10 minutes late you're catching us
five like we started streaming like 5:35
that's actually early very reason even
though our official start time is 5:30
5:30 5 is considered early yeah so
that's just kind of that sort of pâtés
the overall picture of the whole show in
general really have to be honest it
really does and it's a fun show we keep
we keep things loose we do have sort of
a note guide that you know we write up
some notes for articles that we find but
we kind of just like freeball it i did i
did i have to do the thing okay it's
very proud of myself okay then I can
like sort of like hand it back off to
you good
um you wanted to or you could keep going
you're doing a great job uh honestly I
run out of things to say okay I think I
think it's
you know it's a baton pass all right so
this claimer if you're not already
impressed with the show we haven't even
really done much drinking yet we do
drink some beer on the show so it's
geared towards adults if you want to
have a beer with us please feel free and
do so drink responsibly of course
occasionally we also might use adult
language such as curse words on a show
from time to time try keep things real
but if you are a younger viewer that
kind of thing you might want to look
elsewhere we should do a grades version
of our show one of these episodes yeah
maybe for april fools
will make a kid-friendly version of
awesome hardware and where your pig mask
I can wear the pig mask that's
horrifying you should bring that where's
the pigment and put it back all right
but sounds like you should bring it out
so that the thumbnail is it's a lie
right yes right yeah at some points pig
mask shame on you for trusting
thumbnails in the first place but yeah I
think that'd be fun do it like maybe for
April Fool's we could do a kid's episode
where we kind of like what we did for
new egg or you know you draw children in
your children in and then we release all
the f-bombs you know it's kind of like
an ambush no we would never do that to
your children or the little ones around
you but I'd be fun I just kind of want
to do like the whole show with Muppets
throwback as well hey give me some of
that
non-alcoholic cider yeah just make it
like oh really
obviously for children then Afiya though
would you be drinking for the puppet the
whole time
you'd be tricky with the butt and the
puppets would just be getting more and
more fun and silly and relaxed over the
course of the show not not drunk or
buzzed that's the theme yep that's
thanks that would be fun I like it we'll
put in the pink taxi let's see if we get
any angry you're getting comments you
see people with kids all right
let's really quickly plug our stores if
you guys like the stuff in the content
we produce check out our stores - pulsar
bird at net I've got some mouse mats and
zip up Hoodie which is awesome and some
cool new mugs as well the ever-popular
bottle opener which is super nice thumb
screw he caps check that out also Kyle's
store is bit with tech slash door it is
and you can buy stuff there as well yes
all comes from the same place it's all
real nice real
so it's not like you're getting some
crappy knockoff garbage you know that we
slapped a brand on no this is actually
pretty it's pretty good stuff this is
true really quickly I wanted to point
out that there are only a few fidget
spinners left oh really
yes so I will not be restocking those
this is sort of a I bought them when the
when the fad was was hot and it's long
it's not still hot it spinners aren't
still flying up I don't think anyone
myself included expected this fad to be
anything less or more than a fact that
you've sold through most of them means
that you predict predict there's pretty
there's probably like five left there's
about there's probably five or six left
the crystal RGB shirts are still on sale
for 14 bucks nice um John is so good if
you click on the the crystal RGB shirt
and it takes through the product page he
even linked the video that that that
where it was initially featured tech
skits that I did a while back in case
you were wondering what the relevance is
there if you wanted to light up some
crystal you can do that for $14.99
thirty nine nine which is a damn good
price so I'm told Street prices more in
the GPU braces alright let's let's get
right into it
do it with a 500 donation what so 500
PHP not PCP but still exciting pieces
Filipino pieces about forty to one and a
twenty five dollar US dollar donation
which is a good reminder guys continue
donating we will read all of the
messages or donation amounts that you
attach to those donations at the end of
each half of the show if it's your first
time we split the show up in the two
halves on YouTube whereas it's all
straight as it's in it's in its entirety
on Twitch so obviously today the first
half is going up on Paul's channel and
the most mature word of mine so keep
keep giving us money we like it gets us
hot gets us red-hot disagree cut right
in the nipples disagree but you know I
don't want to argue
jorpe sure it's your show all right this
is the news segment and because we were
having technical difficulties not all my
lower thirds are aligned so I have a
good news segments later on as well good
news is figure out that all the news is
good but here is Samsung's latest
announcements there is ESS D Z
yes which features Z and this is the SZ
985 it's a high-performance Highlander
it's enterprise nvme SSD it's one of the
available in two models 800 gigs and 240
gigs
what's so Z about it it's called zine
and and if you want to make something
sound like it's faster and better put
them previously exotic lettering you
usually put a letter in front of it as
either is a common as you will add at
least 15 to 20% of speed formats if you
put an X in front o 30 to 40-percent but
that's a generational leaf yeah but I
mean with X you got it you know you get
your risk offending certain people who
you know it's like there's like X
religious symbol that kind of thing
ex-girlfriends as well
yeah ex machina all this is to say it's
a juicer save hello the road trace by
Samsung to go with the zine and for the
naming okay and then of course the
matching name of the product the SC 985
I'm a sucker for you know lowball
marketing so if they say it's faster
because it's got a zine it I sure as
hell believe I believe them - no need
two independently tested or anything
absolutely this is intended to compete
with Intel's op teen memory and we've
talked about obtain a decent amount on
the show and done a video or two about
it here and there
op team members really fast it's also
very expensive it's also only been
released in products that are either
made for the enterprise or not very
exciting like the OP teen memory stuff
that they initially launched they do
have a consumer version now that's
available it's been getting a little bit
of a little bit of reviews here and
there about it but this is Samsung's
answer and actually they've been working
on this for a while and in fact they
were supposed to have launched this
earlier they started showing this at
trade shows in 2016
two years ago and they initially
promised one terabyte drives in 2016
which was last year if you guys know
two years ago yep two terabyte and four
terabyte drives were already supposed to
be out in 2017 now it is January 2018
and they are announcing they're actually
announcing the law the upcoming launch
of this product so it's definitely been
delayed but this is a derivative Xena
and is a derivative of their existing 3d
and that they already have and it's
supposed to be faster at least
significantly faster when it comes to
the read speeds yeah Dean and already
sounds like 3d man to me just because
when I first read that I thought
immediately thought z-axis I was like
there's probably some relation there X Y
&amp;amp; Z yeah the read performance though of
the Xena is supposed to be 10 times
higher than their existing 3d TLC end
which is you know that's a nice nice
boost it's not quite what you expect
with adding the Z but you know it's it's
difficult to bring a lot of extra
performance out of this type of product
but it's got 1.5 gigs of lpddr4 DRAM so
on cache on the drive
typically you pair about one gig of
cache with about one terabyte of NAND
and with typical SSD configurations so
the an antique article which is linked
in the video's description along with
their all the articles we're going to
talk about today said that seems kind of
weird either they're doing a ton of
over-provisioning with the drive and
actually giving you more but limiting it
to a capacity of like 800 gigs or
whatever for the 800 gig version or they
say have some other way that it's
actually managing the memory that
requires more than the typical gig of
DRAM per terabyte of NAND flash used by
most SSDs right there's no full
performance specifications from Samsung
but they did list a few few specs among
the all the specs you'd want to hear the
spec they released just so happens to be
the one that beats Intel 750 thousand
random read input/output operations per
second or I apps which is a very nice
very high high number Intel's competing
drive the octane SSD DCP 4800 X also an
enterprise model gets about 550,000 high
ops the right speed of Samsung's though
is only 170
and that is 77% slower than its reads
whereas with the Intel drive the reads
or the the writes only drop off about 9%
to about 500 K so Intel 550 500 for
reads and writes Samsung 750 170 and all
by up to 800 gigs but sometimes read
performance is more impressive it
depends on where you're implementing the
drive and what kind of data center
you're running and all that kind of
thing
endurance rating is 30 Drive it's
already totaled writes per day for five
years which is about the same endurance
as the p40 entered X Samsung will be
presenting the Z's SSDs z9 85 at the
international solid-state circuits
conference which is coming at February
11th to 15th which I'm sure all of you
have any calendar right yes you got that
Cal did definitely international
solid-state circuits conference I'm not
gonna be making sensationally so this is
definitely a launch announcements and
announcement that's announcing they're
going to launch at some point but pretty
soon there's something only offering
this in PCIe its PCI you drive yeah okay
yeah so there you go sure sure well I
guess the reason I wanted the reason I
live with this story is to point out
that Intel has made a lot of
advancements with op team and there's a
lot of cool things about octane it's
very fast when it comes to the actual
design of the memory itself and it's
cool that Samsung is coming out of
something that's competitive with that
because if we ever want to see obtain
reasonable speeds or I'm sorry reason
very surprised yeah it's gonna need
something that competes with it from a
competitor like Samsung so yeah
all right speaking of introducing more
competition TSMC the Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation
has started conduction or construction
of a new fab
I have 18 over there in Taiwan fabulous
it does sound fabulous
I had fab to that article article here
from hexxus dotnet which is why all the
numbers are in pounds and whatever but
this is the southern Taiwan Science Park
near China and city this is a
groundbreaking ceremony for the
next major 12-inch Giga fab from TSMC 12
inch yeah yeah it's very impressive it's
very very long this is their chairman
dr. Morris Chang they're in the center
chain with the golden shovel mr. Chang
yes happy to be there he does he looks
pretty a you actually looks kind of
sleepy he looks like he's racist
let's look no no he looks tired like
they said no like instant like this dude
over here Paul
smiley he even be next to you he's
smiling he's like hey I'm kind of stoked
to be here I'm probably gonna make a lot
of money from this place this guy in the
fur green sky like whoa this guy's
taking a picture I wasn't told every
pictures this guy's smiling yeah he's
he's doing like a low-key like I know
something you don't
emili´s I'm just saying that mr. Chang
doesn't see it but to be fair he is
retiring be fair later this year he's
retiring in June and he's he's 86 years
old so oh he's an ass and he's he's the
chairman of little one of the largest
largest essentially the biggest
semiconductor manufacturer in the world
I may be divided they're developing into
three phases and that's gonna be
three-phase manufacturing plant phase
one is gonna be there is what they're
working first so manufacturing equipment
for that should be installed by quarter
3 2019 so next year volume production in
early 2020 phase 2 as good looking at
volume production and later in 2020 and
phase 3 construction will begin q3 of
2019 next year and that won't hit volume
production until 2021 so we're looking
at 2020 2021 until this actually starts
spitting out silicon that will actually
be used in products once it's up and
running that triple phase fab 18s output
will exceed will exceed a million twelve
inch wafers per year and you know it's
much wafer there's lots depending on
what's being put on the wafer has lots
of little chips yeah you can cut out of
it so that's many many CPUs or GPUs or
whatever thanks again hopefully GPUs
because we could use those videos lots
more GPUs it's gonna support 4,000 high
quality jobs over there and Taiwan
quality German they've already invested
I'm sorry they're gonna be invest
500 billion NT that's new Taiwan dollars
it's approximately 12 billion great
British pounds which translates into a
US dollar amounts that I was planning on
looking at the convertible boys rating
before the show but I didn't get around
to it so 12 brilliant 12 billion great
British pounds give up they've already
spent 200 billion NT or 4.8 billion
great British pounds on 5 nanometer
technology in R&amp;amp;D since 2015 because 5
nanometer Feb did it have a yes I than a
5 nanometer so this is even shrink e'er
than what AMD is working on with their
7-day of your stuff right that mean yep
will be a power efficient for sure and
they are to have rnd underway for a 3
nanometer fab in the same park and they
have 300 people already working on R&amp;amp;D
for that so any damn I do at TSMC make
make more chips there's a nice aerial
view of the southern Taiwan Science Park
I miss Taiwan yeah I've never been done
to Tainan yeah you ever I only been to
mainly OpenType Taipei and down the east
coast of all yen yeah alright next up is
a little story on the FCC and a G PI and
the government making their own 5g
network sort of an interesting random
this is just kind of funny when the
start the story itself so here's the
deal Axios
originally reported over this past
weekend that officials within the Trump
administration have been provoked
proposing the creation of a nationwide
5g network in order to protect against
Chinese leadership and forthcoming
network technology so they're worried
they're like security concerns that
cause these people to be like hey we
need to make a nationalized 5g a
nationwide network now I've become an
equal though okay
there are there is very valid arguments
and discussion to be had in favor of and
against a national 5g network and I'm
not going to dive into that right now
no no way am I prepared for that type of
argument but let's just say that what
actually hi and the FCC have been doing
recently is the complete opposite of a
national 5g Network they've been trying
to take away a government get rid of the
government get the government out of you
know any type of control or regulation
over the over the Internet's so the
Trump administration to come suddenly
coming out be like hey we're considering
an and they you know and nationalized 5g
network across the nation apparently
they didn't check with Ajit pie first
like nobody ran this by him that this
the news kind of came out so he he
published a response that he opposes any
proposal for the federal government to
build and operate a nationwide 5g
Network and some other some other
garbage I don't like reading this stuff
he writes cuz it irritates me but it's
triggering but as he opposes it and if
you want to listen to everyone else in
the FCC which includes three Republican
and two Democratic members and including
the two Democratic members who we feel
have been speaking out very strongly and
in ways we very sincerely agree with
which is bendin Clyburn and Jessica
rosenworcel they agree to they also say
this is a bad idea so you have a rare
unanimous consent in the FCC that
hey guys probably building our own
national 5g network is a bad idea so
yeah like I said I'm not gonna try to
are like you know damn a toothpick
together it was just kind of funny after
all the stuff that a GP and and has been
doing right and the decisions to like
get rid of net neutrality and all that
kind of stuff
that suddenly like that this is a maybe
thing right whatever so if the acting
commissioners of the FCC have anything
to do with it it's not gonna go anywhere
but hey if it does I'm sure we'll talk
about it next up human uber what do you
think
human uber what does that mean
well as pointed out in the article by
Brian Feldman at New York mate Meg
oh this was actually sort of sort of
this is kind of idea was presented on
Arrested Development's that in our
article where there was a surrogate and
this guy whose name was Larry middleman
and the reason was a dad an Arrested
Development was in jail he's like in
jail the whole time but he's still
trying to do all these business deals
and everything like that so his Larry
middleman going around with a hat on it
says surrogate with a camera on the
front of it and he's like I think he was
that he had an earpiece going so he
would say stuff in the right yeah so
anyway he knows whether or not that's
where the idea actually came from but
this is coming from the MIT Technology
reviews e/m tech conference which is
going on in Asia this week and
researchers have showed off a human Eber
and which someone straps a tablet to
their face and fills in for someone else
and here's here's some tweets of the
pictures of it which is that looks like
[Laughter]
it's like Daft Punk back there how does
how does the person with the helmet see
yeah that's that's what I'm not sure but
it looks like there's they have a VR
headset on or something as well with a
camera connector with something so that
they can actually see what's in them but
that seems easy flippable
mechanism but still yeah but they show
this off I think the helmets part of the
design I don't think that's like a
motorcyclist or anything because that
guy looks like he's gonna yeah well it
seems like it would be easier if it was
just a self-contained unit that you can
you can put on and take off or whatever
but but yeah so it's actually called
chameleon mask is what the product is
and of course it was modeled in Japan of
all places yes and gin Rickey moto is
the develop is the guy
who showed this off he is a Japanese arv
our researcher affiliated with Sony he
says it's surprising surprisingly
naturally that actually do this I wonder
if I mean it might especially if you
wear the same same jacket got a picture
that if you want him to have the same
wardrobe see this is weird it's like
he's looking at himself because he's
wearing the same hoodie and then is that
a picture of himself on a screen
that's weird but see what I don't get is
what's the difference between this and
just talking to someone on skype why do
you think it's telepresence so you're
actually there and if you are like if
you're a doctor and you're remote and
you're really good at what you do but
it's you know you can't fly everywhere
and go then you could have somebody with
this on going from patient to patient
and looking at them and when when you
talk you you know they see your face
talk and they hear your voice and
everything and they can talk back to you
and do you hear what they say and
whoever your surrogate is standing here
hi like I don't know how you I don't
know how you control them that's what
I'm not sure about how do you control
right the person's vehicle like some
things like this some electrical
stimulation they get old zaps forward or
whatever yeah you have some extra mics
where you talk to them okay hey Nick
it's the wrong room yeah I don't even
know these people so many many questions
are raised by this but still still seems
like it great idea it's like what
happens what happens what what happens
to the poor the poor surrogate who like
finds themselves in like either a
terrible drug deal or like maybe it's
like they're about to have sex like
someone mentioned in the comments like
all right baby unzip it and like the
circuits like wait am I supposed to do I
do it how far do I how far do I take
this at what point do I draw the line of
being somebody else's body that's why
I'm so excited about the future because
all these all these things you would
have sex with two people at once yeah in
one body yeah the future what if your
surrogate
welcome to the pinnacle of what if while
you earn
into your surrogate they're also dialed
in to someone else who's a surrogate for
them like I need to get son I need to
get some shopping done while I do my job
as a surrogate so it's just how many
levels can you go I don't know and this
time go slower when you're a surrogate
within a surrogate I'm not sure wait for
the kick back yeah so so an interesting
concepts and it says the developers also
tested cosplaying as enemy characters in
real life which I don't know why the
article seems relatively serious epsilen
even though just at the end it kind of
throws it oh yeah and they did anime
characters - what's like on the the
screen on the tablet I don't know like I
did did the person wear a cosplay
costume and then they act like Sailor
Moon or something or you know I don't
know but that introduces even more
possibilities and so you know the whole
sex thing with this obviously witch and
futures futures looking bright this is
gonna be a good tool for a long-distance
relationship oh yeah
like what if you got a super jealous of
you of the person who is a surrogate
because you like went and like yeah like
man I like bang the shit out of my wife
or whatever right it wasn't you know I
feel about that like you're watching it
alright Martian tell me how did it feel
let's move on speaking of the future
lookin bright flame throwers you guys
may or may not be following the ongoing
continuous sale from the boring company
owned by Elon Musk of flamethrowers wait
so explain to me cuz is the boring
company is a real company or a real
company where they just make stupid shit
no no boring company this is I think
this one onto a different video about
Brazil so they actually make really cool
stuff and also stupid stuff no no the
bar
the boring company is about boring as in
boring holes in the earth ah right
okay it was the company that Elon Musk
could decided to create when he was
stuck in traffic in LA I believe right
and he's like you know it would be
better than sitting in traffic in LA yes
if we just had a bunch of holes dug
under LA where people could go through
tunnels and whatever and so I started
this company gotcha now a few months ago
he they made it they made a hat cuz it's
called the boring company right so it's
obviously you got to play on that boring
sure so I made a hat maybe made hats
called for the boring company and he
said they and they sapere sold well and
he he basically said at some point that
if they if they sell 50,000 boring
company hats at $20 each then he'll and
I don't I don't know how the timeline
with that I don't know if he said also a
boring company flamethrower or if he
just said we'll sell something else
really cool or something like that point
is they sold that many hats at 20 bucks
each that's a lot of hats and now you
can buy a boring company flamethrower
nice and Elon Musk has been doing great
marketing for it by saying stuff like a
flamethrower is a super terrible idea
and you shouldn't buy one unless you
like fun of course no one must gets the
Internet that's why he's so much you
know they and they showed some pictures
of it of them actually testing these out
there short-throw flamethrowers so you
know there's a pretty decent sized flame
there but it's not going a crazy long
distance that's but it's important for
certain areas especially like California
where that's illegal
it's yeah and can't be legal restriction
a full-blown flamethrower that she'd
stay in third device the the it has to
have arranged it it's regulated if it
has a range of 10 feet or more so that's
why the throw is on the flame is it's
kind of less perfect a California sent
assembly on Miguel Santiago has did some
reactionary like legislation against it
or something like that but that's not
like a second the mode they designed
these in such a way that you know it's
not a full-on flamethrower that's gonna
you know torch a bunch of people from 50
feet away or something like that
yes practical uses include a farmer
could use it to clear their fields at
the end of the growing season
firefighters could use them to do
controlled burns although I have to
imagine firefighters might have their
own tools or any company issued flame
throwers I feel like that's what that's
what happens when you become a flame
throws to you starting to turn into
inanimate objects well I mean if they
get the arm attachment for it right
because the augment yeah you become a
firefighter
like here's your your hat and your big
issue like your really heavy Flint
jacket coat you know flame retardant
coat and your flame server right your
fireman's you gotta start some fires
kids fight fire with fire and then you
know some ritual with a pan or something
else when your kid fight yeah anyway so
there the point here really was that
they were selling out of these in fact
he was tweeting about it and the article
says they sold 10,000 of them but as of
earlier today he was at 15k let's see if
there's been any update 17 all right as
of eight minutes ago they've sold 17.5
Wow
seventeen and a half thousand of these
streams believe it live five hundred
dollars each
Wow so there's two there's a little over
2000 of these left see if you guys want
you can still buy a boring a boring old
flamethrower that's all honestly pretty
cheap 20 bucks I mean I have to imagine
they're making some amount of profit on
it I mean that's not the intent probably
right I don't think name on muskets five
hundred times seventeen thousand five
hundred I don't know the Google Calendar
Google calculator pros doesn't work well
as your Google calculator frozen I don't
know and also because this what I don't
know I don't know what's wrong the blade
Pro let the blade decide it wants to be
less professional it's pure struggle and
not even have a calculator to touch you
know that's like a Windows Update thing
you need to really knows update
it's and I think I've had issues with
that myself right the flamethrowers
aren't gonna ship until spring though
they're gonna start shipping in spring
just what they said he said also
yesterday that they've sold about 3000
admittedly overpriced fire extinguishers
maybe that was an upgrade option you get
if you're checking out with your flame
thrower to get a fire extinguisher if
you want to be safe and yeah that's
pretty much it all right you know let's
move on to a new segments that I
specifically made up for today it's
called tech drama we've talked about
some drama in the titled oh but wait
before I do that after I almost forgot
about this thanks
I was trained yeah I was trying to think
like you know everyone saying Elon Musk
is so smart and everything like that you
know for the flamethrower forgetting the
flamethrower but if if you recall
Spaceballs did it first yeah great
Spaceballs the flamethrower there it is
yeah I wonder if kids the kids love this
the kids love this man yeah I wonder if
that's where he got it from the beholder
is boring he meant back going hey what
if we made that a reality
yeah all right that would be a LAN
mosque ridiculous idea totally seems
physics me that that's that that's where
it originated
I want one game but all right so let's
talk about some tech drama that's been
going on this week now first off we
don't we don't approve of tech drama
we're discussing I did it to try to
dispel it's learn to deem it up to tamp
down the flames of the tech drama
possibly start some fights possibly some
solutions you know that we might suggest
or more fighting but just over this past
weekend there's been a bit of a
kerfuffle a bit of a hub of kerfuffle
surrounding a video posted by adored TV
who adored TV Jenna we've talked about
some of his videos before he's he's got
a pretty decent following on YouTube
and everything he talks about tech stuff
just the guy who really really really
really likes AMD um he has been accused
that before and what I don't want to get
into here is like because there's lots
of like people people gay people get
opinions about you know certain
youtubers whatever and they decide like
oh they suck or whatever or they're
really good or anything like that
like there's there's people who have
preformed opinions about maybe ad or TV
or who knows even PC perspective but I
just want I just want to present the
facts here and then perhaps provide some
I don't know some feedback or some
subjects some suggestions that that
maybe will help I don't know you're calm
over in the forums has a pretty decent
sort of collection on this so that's
linked in the video's description if you
guys want to check it out
Ryan Stroud is owner of PC perspective
also they recently launched a company
last year I believe called trout
Research and they do stuff like writing
white papers for tech companies
it's a white paper again white paper is
a it's a technical document that goes
over specifications and expected
performance of a specific product it's
not like a review so it's not
necessarily critical it's just supposed
to be a very detailed assessment of a
product I think it's what it's supposed
to be and be able to deliver yeah oh
Ken's
and the and if you're a manufacturer or
something like that of something like
you know video cards or whatever other
technical product then it is helpful in
some ways for you to go and get an
independent technical company gotcha
such a choice for example like all the
specs like off of an SSD retail package
when you see like 550 read 500 write
that was taken off of that products
white paper that was possibly I mean but
the company could do could do the
testing themselves and put it that way
but yeah having that my paper to
independently validate things and
clarify that things work the way they
should
is yeah I guess that's what it boils
down to today
the initial video was called a flawed
perspective as listed here in the
article and it was basically it was very
critical of PC perspective and it went
in and covered I think I want to say
four main points that Jim issues Jim had
with PC perspective going back to
article and video that where I believe a
couple years old now two three years old
about initial PC perspective coverage of
freesync that was Critias been
criticized and the criticism from Jim
was that they should have done more
updates to it or made it more evidence
especially in the video that certain
things weren't exactly as they were
initially presented the main complaint
was that the video was comparing two
different monitors at the same SPECT was
not exactly the same monitor there's
more details on that in the article but
the second thing is general bias against
AMD which Jim presented a few things
that he felt were evidence that there is
a PC perspective Amazon affiliate link
for Vega frontier edition that was
actually on the AMD website which seems
weird if you're saying that spy it's
biased against AMD but then AMD somehow
has a an Amazon affiliate link on their
website that benefits PC perspective
apparently that was just a mistake from
from the explanation by Ryan and whatnot
but if that just seemed like kind of a
weird thing and then there was the
shrout research the existence of that
company and specifically the Intel 900p
review that they did is along with al
Amalfitano who does a lot of the storage
reviews over at PC perspective is knows
a lot of stuff and does a very in-depth
coverage of storage and I referenced his
articles a lot yeah
now the accusation there was that they
weren't as upfront as they could have
been with the fact that due to the fact
that shrout research had arranged with
Intel to do a white paper on their 900
p-series SSDs that's where at least one
of the reviews
apples that was used in there an article
that reviewed that SSD came from mm-hmm
that it wasn't fully disclosed that
there's this you know these two
companies going on at the same time one
being a review website one being the
shark research website that works
directly as manufacturers and that you
know it doesn't seem like it's legit and
on the up-and-up for and whatever now
Ryan's Shrout rated wrotes and this is
over on reddit so there's also a link to
this a response to the ethical concerns
and this is this is very long so it also
includes the email conversation back and
forth between Ryan and Jim that went on
over the weekends it also has a lot of
stuff such as just evidence to that
sorta that that Ryan put out there
saying sort of well let me let me
respond to these accusations as as best
I can
there's obviously some it seems like
there's some bad blood going back
further and in the past maybe that we're
not aware of because it does seem like
pretty antagonistic from from the adora
TV side to go and post this video in the
way that they did and Ryan's initial
concern with it was one apparently on
Friday he had some fans of adored TV who
were responding to the video who were
sending like pictures of his house and
that kind of thing yeah which is just
kind of a personal attack now that the
existence of that happening doesn't mean
that there should never be any criticism
or that that type of thing towards
someone but it's definitely an issue
when Ryan wasn't given the chance to
answer any of these accusations prior to
the posting of the video right that was
Ryan's main response was that the right
to reply was something that he felt yeah
he should have had there yep and then
Agron now in the u.s. right to reply is
actually I believe there's actually a
legal precedent surrounding it yes you
might be on the hook for or for like
slander or libel or something like that
if you were to go and post something
about someone without at least going to
them first and a lot of articles use
that are written about something they'll
be like we reached out to this and they
didn't respond exactly like that's going
to comment that whole thing that's
that's the one thing I think's points of
journalism like if you're gonna like
accuse someone of something negative
then you should reach out to them for
comment to some degree to see if they
have anything to respond to instead of
just publishing whatever hell you want
to do for views or whatever it is
without giving them a chance to defend
their their side I think is yeah so
that's the word failed to do that so
maybe his response parently we included
the the fact that I guess in Europe
that's not that's not that the the like
that law doesn't exist or whatever like
he he didn't he wasn't legally obligated
or responsible to offer PC perspective
the right to reply based on his location
geographically but like Kyle said even
if that is the case that still doesn't
mean that you should just go and post
something about someone especially when
you are sort of sort of in the same
industry without at least giving them
the opportunity or the chance to know
something about it or at least be
prepared or be able to present their
side of the story right
I felt reading over over Ryan stuff that
he did a good job being very thorough
and covering each point and everything
like that and in quite a few of the
areas he he did seem to admit the admit
faults to some degree they've made some
updates to for instance the freesync
articles I don't know if they've done
anything as far as the video goes but
yeah he put lots of stuff up there about
like you know their communications with
AMD and NVIDIA back when they were
initiated initially doing the frame
rates FCAT testing stuff that they did
and it was four or five years ago what
were the accusations about freesync what
were those about Precinct was so
ghosting was like when freezing a g-sync
were first coming out and freeze
was the answer or the other response did
you sink or whatever there were they
were looking very close up at free sync
and gsync and you know that that turbine
young with the whatever thing with the
windmill looking really closely at that
and just comparing actual response time
and seeing if the end ghosting ran pc
perspective came to the conclusion that
that free sink was more susceptible to
ghosting than g-sync
mm-hmm the critiques that I've heard
about it sensed a sense that I'm just
reading up to this article and I'm gonna
leave this sort of vague because I don't
feel like I've I know enough of the
details to test state it clearly but I
guess they were using two different
monitors then had the same
specifications but weren't the exact
same monitor so there was some question
there as to the validity of the testing
so interesting yeah Brian's specifically
said we've made the edits and updates
the adora TV video called out
specifically with regards the freesync
thing we believe at the time that our
new article on the topic was adequate
due diligence because they didn't do an
updated article on it while it's
impossible for any outlet outlet to
update all published articles or videos
every time some something changes to
recognize that that was this was an
important issue we'll try to do better
about updating published content when
appropriate as for the free sync panel
debate the text of our view stated that
the panel's shared the same
specifications not that they were the
same panels oh I click tonight yeah
however in comments related to the
article we did state that the panels
were the same that was our area and we
apologized so yeah all this is to say
when it comes down to something like
this it doesn't seem like a bit of
muckraking and a bit of like sort of
creating scandal yeah from the adored TV
side lens I don't tend to look favorably
on that just as a general principle of
like if you find something that's messed
up and you
to create a video about it to expose
that than fine yeah if you're looking
for something and you're like I'm gonna
find something messed up and create a
video out of it then you're projecting
what you what you want onto that subject
and it'll short I don't think that's
necessarily the way to go about it so
yeah I would discourage from this type
of video that simply creates drama or
controversy for the sake of that right
and I would definitely say that
especially if you're doing something
like that and if you decided that that
that you should do that because let's be
for this to be fair and honest reviewers
should be scrutinized there should be
some level of accountability there and
if someone's just posted up you know
nonsense numbers or if someone's
exhibiting clear bias or something like
that they should definitely be held
accountable right but right to reply I
think is definitely something that
whether or not it's legally enforceable
should be provided to someone simply as
a courtesy yeah especially if you're
about to to post a video or an article
that's yeah calls their legitimacy in
the question yeah it's it's hard to and
people don't fact-check and they like
they like someone that's fine if you
like someone you know you follow them
and you like things they say and what
they stand for but if they make
allegations especially against another
creator or journalist or anything anyone
people should fact check that stuff
instead of just sort of rallying behind
it as like and take it for truth because
the more you turn a blind eye to content
like that the more the creator who's
making it is it is gonna is gonna make
more of it and they're gonna be like
well cool I can just continue accusing
people of X Y &amp;amp; Z like I could accuse
you of like touching my grundle or
something like that like you Paul got a
little close to my dick the other day
and it can be completely false but then
like people will not fact check whether
or not you touched my dick and all of a
sudden overnight you are a target of
sexual harassment which I may or may not
have enjoyed and it's just you know
people need to do some more research I
think
for hopping on the bandwagon and you
know saying that you touch my dick
alright let's move on let's move on sure
next up is more drama or text Rama
article yeah chapters one getting into
it quickly alright so this is this one
is between and maybe this is gonna get
me in trouble or not we got a gamer's
Nexus over here of course there's Steve
and here their specific video talking
about micro Center and and them being
rip up rip off this is actually their
one of their this is one of their videos
I didn't get around to watching what did
how what what was it about so gamers
Nexus is really pissed off that micro
Center is selling graphics cards for
well above MSRP and a lot of us are mad
that graphics cards are selling for so
expensively
here's joke productions I've linked both
these videos in the video's description
his Wow his headline is Idol is very all
caps II and everything like that micro
centers stab PC gamers in the back so
here's what this all boils down to both
both are articles and here is wrong with
this one here's the micro centers
website where they actually have a
message that they've posted about this
because they're aware of what they're
doing to some degree they say you may
have noticed the price of our video
cards has recently increased high demand
from a cryptocurrency miners combined
with constrained shipments from vendors
has created industry-wide George's to
best address your system bully needs
we monitor market prices and set our
prices to be competitive with Amazon and
Newegg for the same products limit
quantities to ensure that many as many
of you as possible can purchase the
component you need and they offer more
discounts a final price well below the
market friends store by local poets and
then they thank you
that's all others also said thank you
it's all basically a big excuse for them
to raise prices of their graphics cards
now the reason I brought this up is
because I disagree
not necessarily district micro Center I
don't know
with gamers Nexus interconnection now
not necessarily that I wholeheartedly
disagree more so that I feel like
there's an aspect of this that at least
isn't being addressed
here's my point these graphics cards are
selling for way above MSRP you know you
got gtx 1070 s gone for more than a
thousand dollars and 1050 t is in ten
60s and lord knows even the AMD cards
were expensive already and now they're
even more expensive people on some level
and i don't know whether it's
speculating cryptocurrency miners or
people who are just like graphics cards
worth a lot of money i better buy one
people are buying them they don't price
then you don't have an industry-wide
price scheme going on unless people are
actually paying those dollar amounts for
those prices so if you want to address
the root of the problem well i don't
know how to do that because you have to
suddenly figure out how to suddenly make
more currency not affect GPU prices but
if people are willing to pay this money
getting mad at micro Center for charging
the amount of money that people are
willing to pay I don't think really does
that much because people are gonna pay
that money anyway
Micro Center when they get a shipment in
if they're like you know what we're
gonna do the right thing and we're gonna
sell all these for MSRP we're gonna sell
all these 10 70s for 400 bucks when they
come in that would immediately be
snapped up and they'd be really
realistic on eBay or whatever you know
you might have one or two people who
will go in there and are able to buy a
product and get it an MSRP but they're
gonna be resold people are going to get
the value out of that so why should
randoms who buy and realist things on
eBay or Craigslist or whatever wherever
people are relisting things why should
they get all that extra money when micro
Center or any other retail you might
talk about is doing the actual effort of
dealing with distribution centers or
manufacturers and bringing the products
in and listing them for sale and having
the return policies and doing the
logistics and like that's a lot of work
thing and why should Micro Center not
not be able to charge the amount of
money that the public is willing to pay
you know
if more money is falls into micro
senators pocket for selling these GPUs
at a competitive rate like everyone else
is then maybe down the line they can use
that extra profit to funnel back into
the back into like doing more deals more
sales having better inventory more
product in their stores I mean
eventually if like if micro Center got
bigger and got more money then there's a
potential that it could be better for
the consumers as well and I think part
of me is wondering like why why are
people angry at micro Center
specifically when like sites like Amazon
and Newegg and literally everyone else
are selling GPUs at the same price why
are they targeting micro Center why
haven't there been any like Amazon you
and I have a bone to pick like why micro
like okay cuz they're primarily geared
towards PCs and stuff I get it but
there's still a company there's Micro
Center has managed to put themselves in
the spot that Newegg used to be in like
I feel like noon I used to be kind of
the darling of the PC builder industry
like everyone would be like I'll buy it
at Newegg whatever and maybe they still
are to some degree but I feel like not
as much as they used to be whereas Micro
Center it's like wow you live near a
micro Center oh my gosh you're so lucky
you can go in there and buy their really
discounted CPUs and just to be able to
walk into a retail store that just sells
all computer parts but it's like that
mentality like Micro Center sort of that
underdog it's that sold out and it's a
sale yet small-time brail right right
that they have decided to go ahead and
do this and whatever so but I mean they
have a right to stay competitive as a
business regardless of how they've
behaved in the past like there's nothing
wrong with I don't see really anything
wrong with what they're doing and then
the other thing is like even if they
were to sell their GPUs at MSRP like the
word on that would get out super quick
and all it would take is a handful of
miners literally a handful of miners to
buy up all their inventory at those
prices like if if microsomes the
one-stop shop where they can get GPUs at
MSRP they're probably gonna clear one
guy is gonna go in and buy like 50 of
them
right so at the end of the day and then
they want to make it to sell to the
gamers anyway so so maybe one or two
gamers will get lucky and get one before
the onslaught of miners comes around but
like realistically there's more to this
and there's an another article from PC
gamer talking about micro centers prices
and the fact that you can actually if
you're willing to do a combo and of
course need all the rest of the
components for a computer you can get a
GPU at something around the the retail
price but it's by buying a combo that
takes that overpriced graphics card and
pairs it with a motherboard and a
processor and everything else so you're
walking out of the store paying $1200
but you didn't just get a graphics card
you got the other components too
now if you don't need the other
components and that's not a very very
big help to you of course if you just
need if you're like man I'm just waiting
to upgrade just my graphics card then
then that's you know what are you gonna
do there but I do want to respond to at
least a couple of people in chat I've
been warned by the way that Steve's
probably to come back at me last time I
challenged him was with H 500 P and yeah
turns out I was wrong but but here's a
new egg let's look at 1070 in cents yeah
a lot of people in chat are saying like
Steve was upset because apparently
Michael ascender had the thing where if
you buy the stuff in like as a bundle
that you would get the GPU for a
discounted price so that's their way of
you know trying to make it at least
somewhat worth your money I guess for
paying that much for a GPU if that's how
much should you use cost right now but
alright let's go to new egg because
here's another thing I was saying the
Steve was complaining that on other
websites like new egg and Amazon they
have marketplace sellers right they have
third-party sellers to go on the website
and you might see a GTX 1084 $1500 or
whatever but it's a third party it's not
new it actually not Amazon so if you go
on new again you're searching for stuff
all sellers will include marketplace
sellers let's just include new egg here
and oh my gosh
new egg is selling gtx 1060
for $400 that seems to be significantly
above the MSRP for a GTX 1060 right new
eggs doing it - yeah so don't try to
come at me and tell me that all the new
egg prices are actually MSRP and it's
just the marketplace sellers no that's
not true
these are selling for they're not as
crazy overpriced as like eBay prices and
marketplace sellers and whatever but
they're doing it - yeah everyone's
playing the game and every body and it
all right so check out those videos if
you guys wanna watch them and of course
we we love we love Steve and gamers
Nexus and Joker and all they're good
people but I had to make I had to cut
some drama I had to call people out make
make a scandal fuck you
last bit is gonna be good news and I'm
gonna go through this really quick
because yeah actually our in my hours
yeah I was calm and none of these are
really tech related and I just wanted to
talk about good news so nice here we go
Tom Hanks is gonna play mr. Rogers you
are my friend a fact that's just that's
gonna create a singularity of goodness
it's gonna suck us all in into a good
old black hole of warm fuzzy feelings
warm standing wonderfulness I don't know
I like the Jimmer do you ever watch mr.
I mean probably not I didn't like watch
it but I like I'd watch like Sesame
Street before and then as soon as mr.
Rogers would come on I'd watch the intro
listen to the intro song and then I'd
turn it off cuz then he got creepy yes
but um but no it was always very nice
man
alright so this is this is a district
based on the distribution rights from
the mr. Rogers bat that called you up
you are my friend which is about him and
his producer that I worked with on the
show and it's supposed to be really good
story and mr. Rogers is a it's like it's
a really good person like yeah around

mm-hmm
bazinga X $25 donation says beer Jack
Daniels here loll don't forget the key

it's harder - harder to ration your
intake when it comes
Jack but you know never then we're gonna
turn one down Nabil Suleiman with the
500 at Filipino pesos hey Paul visiting
the Philippines anytime soon
san me on me whenever I'm more of a red
horse guy I mean sand me guy I'm five to
Sammy but the red horse that's usually

back and visit but perhaps next year I
guess that's this year now because it's
it's 2018 for Lala's birthday she's
she's in her 90s now wishbone for the $5
donation says do you think battlefield 5
would be Vietnam and also PS 5 specs to
be shown at e3 again like they did with
the ps4 code name neo III is very
popular venue for console announcements
so wouldn't be unexpected I don't know
if PS 5 is expected soon soon I feel
like ps4 is still still got some some
time on it and whatever or especially
the PlayStation Pro battlefield 5 would
be Vietnam I don't know doesn't seem
unreasonable said there's been lots of
battle battle war games
he's there thank you though for the
donation green plantain $10 donation got
beer enjoy guys do you know the Maximus
thickness front radiator that can fit
the fractal r6 thank you guys yeah
maximum I guess is probably mean green
plantain I think you can probably go
pretty thick up there because it's got
it's got that bit of a gap I haven't
tested it myself though but I would
expect you know of course like you're 25
28 millimeter but I would expect you
could even go up to the 35 to 40
millimeter range when it comes to
radiator depending on if you're going
with push-pull on the on the fans of
course but you could maybe tweet to
fractal Josh or fractal design North
America and get their actual feedback on
that if specially if you have a specific
radiator you're thinking about using
geared Inc $5 guys love what you do you
help me do my own channel just at 2k
subs keep doing what you do and I will

weird
yep yep pretty much oh the maximun thick
cuz I was talking about reading yeah I
sure appreciate it that's prob about the
worst thing that could have been done
okay thank you how the dragon 510 Tyler
beer no $5 says I have moved all my
hardware to no chassis to fit my card
when I try to boot I get six beeps
forums don't seem to be helping any
thoughts six beeps you actually have a
post speaker connected so that's that's
unique sometimes there's a chassis
intrusion issue that can occur so if you
switched from one chassis to another you
might need to go in there and switch
that off but it's hard to get too much
farther than that without many more
details as far as your platform and what
motherboard you have and everything but
yeah it's definitely gonna need to go
into the motherboard manufacturers
website and see if they have posts beep
a charge sometimes love a chart that
tells you what is being told to you by
those post beeps used to be the post
beeps was the only way you could
diagnose like a motherboard or something
for the delay you got debug LEDs and
whatnot so they're not as common but it
should be telling you something six
beeps in a row is definitely it being
like hey my memory is not installed or
something like that
you forgot the CPU yeah Jake Westall
with $10 I can't think of anything to
say so shut up and take my money we
agree we shall thank you Jake
Sebastian you bet Sebastian Casella 100

thermal paste on am dam1 from ms i love
the show o applying thermal paste on an
AMD am one have isolating that one
I mean MSI's and installation videos are
they're terrible everything the Apple
yeah probably a she's PI right now cuz
yes that's got the most that's yeah the
most impactful it actually impacts yep
Omar Tyndall $10 love you just what's
the best mid tower for a balance of
airflow and quiet with a glass side
panel a balance of airflow and quiet the
define r6 is a is a good choice there
yeah it's got decent airflow but still
has a solid front panel so you won't get
a lot of that I was gonna say measure if
I see Russia Pisces a good option it's
gonna be a little bit louder though cuz
there's not quite as much to block the
noise but very good air flow of air flow
yeah so mmm I guess we're recommending
practically this is a paid sponsorship
this is that's just what comes to mind
because they're recent and yeah yeah
there's probably a good Corsair
recommendation to but it's not it's not
popping into my head there's there's so
many they make too many different cases
Jack cases should last longer yeah

Thank You JD ten dollars will resonate
peace be the band-aid needed to help new
PC builders get a system started also
Steve was mad because employees didn't
know about the bundle policy and Amazon
they would use third-party yes they do
use third-party but they also sell stuff
themselves as well I think resume P use
will be potentially good for people who
are looking to get you know get their
get their game on on PC but don't really
have the money to spend $900 on a miss
range or even a high-end graphics card
so what we talking about that more on my
half though Guido Sarducci $5 Capaldi
prefer Thermaltake ring plus RGB or
Corsair ll series RGB fan I've only
actually worked directly with and used
of course I'll series RGB so I can but
for them and say they're very good fans
I'll be it expensive but you they're
really good fans and quiet and cool RGB
lights and everything Thermaltake ring
plus I I really not worked with directly
so they might be just just good to ya
thick ring ones are good I feel like the
handle does I've worked with them
briefly like I've done like a build
where I've installed like one of them
but I haven't really messed around like
their software isn't the greatest
granted you know of course their link
has its own issues too but at least it
integrates with other devices that you
might have in your system that are
Corsair so it's a bit more integrative
in that sense I think the look thing
obviously aesthetics is subjective but I
do know that the course al series fans
do work really well on radiators so
excellent let's say let's save this last
one for your half okay cuz it's directed
at you anyway short and I'm already
