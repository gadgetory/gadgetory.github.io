Pauls hardware Corsair sent me over this
brand new case to do a video on so it is
called the crystal series 570 X it is a
completely tempered glass covered case a
trend that I'm going to take complete
responsibility for since I did my
tempered glass side panel model with
arctic Panther but I figured what better
way to go over this case for you guys
then to will take it out of the box
first of all I'll run down the features
i'll go ahead and build the system in it
i've got all the parts for that right
back here and then we'll come back and
i'll give you my thoughts alright so i
have removed all of the tempered glass
side panels from this case i was
originally going to show you guys like a
first look of it with everything with
nothing mounted inside but then I
realized all those tempered glass pieces
which are over on the table there I'll
have like the plastic on him and I was
going to like peel all that off and
stuff but I decided no let me wait I'm
doing that and build the system first
because even though tempered glass is a
lot sturdier than plexi it's still best
to kind of keep that stuff on but there
are four tempered glass panels one for
each side one for the top and one for
the front and they are all held on by
these little screws out here which are
pretty good quality and look pretty nice
from the outside also of course you two
pack of accessories in the box so if
it's not obvious already this case is
definitely designed for somebody who
wants to have a good look at everything
going on inside their computer not just
from the side but also from the other
side where the cable management goes
even from up on top and of course from
the front so let's quickly run down the
features why don't we start with dust
filters since they're covering things
right now these are pretty easy to pop
off at least once you remove the four
screws for the tempered glass side
panels these are just held on by magnets
and look at that full coverage right
there with the plenty of space for the
air to flow through and then behind it
the three 120 millimeter fans will come
back to those in just a moment this top
also
moves again just with magnets like so so
full coverage with dust filtration for
the top and then we do have a dust
filter down on the bottom it is a little
bit more standard style at least from
what we see in the past slides up from
the back and a bit smaller one there for
your power supply back to those fans up
front though it comes with 320
millimeter fans included and these are
all RGB which I'm sure will demonstrate
once I get this case actually set up
with the system inside and able to power
on and everything they're all in the
front so you actually don't get any at
least pre-installed exhaust air
filtration for the rear or the top of
this case but you do have lots of
radiator support so you can do 360 on
the front you can do a 280 in the front
of course you could do a 240 or 120 or
anything less than those max radiator
sizes you can also do a 280 or 240 in
the top or 120 of course and then you
got a 120 mount here at the back as well
now the other nice thing about these
radiator mounts at least the front one
you can actually remove the entire fan
mounts with these thumb screws so it's
got thumb screws going up and down here
you can pull that tray off and that will
allow you to mount your radiator and the
fans to it and then just install the
whole tray which is a pretty convenient
way of installing radiators and fans for
a liquid cooling solution of course
actually one quick correction here I
mentioned that front tray is removable
for mounting the radiators the top tray
is removable as well and then there
saying that this will fit a 240
millimeter radiator and it might fit a
280 millimeter meter mede millimeter
radiator just depending on the size and
bulb lessness at the end and how big the
pieces are they come off of it and stuff
but you do have some flexibility there
but at least they are confirming 240
millimeter rad support I'm going to try
to fit a 280 up here the power supply
does have a cover down here it's maybe
about 2/3 the lengths length of the
chassis and it is open on this side so
you could bring cables out through this
direction or most likely you'll pass
them back through there to use the cable
management solution that's on the back
there is a Corsair LED logo that will
light up here that's also going to be
plugged in didn't say RGB so I'm
guessing this is just white but again
I'll test that in just a moment and
there is some ventilation on the top of
your power supply cage just in case you
wanted to put your power supply with the
fan facing up
if that
something that you feel will work better
for your airflow of course you got the
little rubber mats down there for the
power supply feet and then on the back
you have your typical lay up seven
expansion slots 120 millimeter fan match
IO shield all that good stuff not a huge
case a pretty standard ATX layout from
the internal perspective but again I
think the tempered glass and some of the
cable management features are what
Corsair is feeling makes this case
unique as for clearance this direction
you have up to 370 millimeters of length
for GPU clearance so you can go with
really long GPUs for your depth this way
you have a hundred and seventy
millimeters of clearance for CPU coolers
and then for the power supply down here
225 millimeters so pretty much any
modern reasonable power supply that you
would put in a gaming system will fit in
this case I also want to point out down
here they at least have advertised some
some mounting points for pumps air
reservoir and reservoirs so I don't know
if this is a standard layout for you
know your d5 pumps or anything like that
but there are some slots down there so
if you would put a pump or a big tall
reservoir or something you could mount
it to the bottom there theoretically and
that's probably going to be a popular
suzhen solution for anyone whose water
cooling in this case because well that
that's where it would fit pretty much
there's nowhere else to put it your
buttons and i/o for the front are on the
front and kind of off to the right so
you've got a power button of course
right there three buttons for
controlling the RGB fans so it's nice to
be able to control those manually with
buttons rather than having to rely on
software but you have a brightness speed
and then cycling through the different
available presets that can the built-in
controller has available a headphone and
mic jack of course and then we have two
USB 3.0 ports and then here is the flip
side so you can see that controller
which is connected up right here and
then there's a smaller piece right here
so this actually has three of the fans
already plugged in with space for three
more so if you buy more of those RGB
fans that are compatible with this then
you could put them elsewhere in the case
and control them all with this unit this
has a little piece that goes off over to
here with sort of a breakout box and
here you can again control speed color
and mode and then that's got another
lead that goes up to the top so you can
control it via those buttons up top that
I just showed you as for drive support
you basically have four drives bays
two of them are 3.5 inch drive mounts
over here on the side with the typical
pop in from the side I'm not a fan of
this drive mounting method these are
also plastic trays I want to point out
so that definitely could have been
better but I guess they are a bit
lighter if you want to look on the
bright side and they are all black so
they're not going to stand out as
noticeably glaringly plastic or anything
like that
these look at 3.5 inch drives and 2.5
inch drives then 2 more 2.5 inch drive
mounts right here again plastic trays
but they'll get the job done all of
these are tool lists for the most part
at least they're all held on with a
thing Ingle thumb a single thumb screw
lastly over here we have this cable
management brackets thing which is
basically just like kind of a u-shaped
piece of metal that is held on to the
motherboard tray again with a couple
thumb screws not the most elegant
solution I would say but again you're
just using it to pass cables through and
we're going to see as far as access goes
because there's some space up here at
the top and then of course this covers
the actual grommet mounts in there so
you'll be able to pass them through from
that little thing through there I'm
going to see if this is easy to work
with or if this is a pain in the butt to
work with I think maybe it might be a
little bit of a combination of both but
in the end hopefully it will lead to
pretty looking cable management because
this is definitely the kind of case
you're going to need to pay attention to
cable management with all right enough
talking let me build this
okay so the build is complete
everything's on really didn't have too
many issues as far as the build process
goes everything was fairly
straightforward apart from the slightly
more delicate use of these tempered
glass side panel windows the tempered
glass itself I would describe as gray
glass rather than that ultra clear glass
which I believe is slightly less
expensive at least in my experience
purchasing tempered glass but it does
give a little bit of a tint so you can
kind of see anything that lights up and
shines inside peeking through so you can
see I used the same MSI motherboard and
graphics card that I used for build in
the 760 T recently and everything looks
pretty nice also we have a red and black
color scheme going on and then of course
the three fans up in the front all shine
through right now they're all white I
can change the color though the color
cycle goes from white to red to orange
to I believe yellow to green to blue to
purple and then it will do a cycle and
it'll just kind of jump from one to the
other of course you can also change the
speed so that first button was for
changing the color the next one changes
the speed so that will change the speed
at which it changes colors or what
effect you might choose so right now I
have just chosen the effect for its it's
going to glow it's going to breathe very
standard RGB lighting LED effects and
then of course I can cycle through those
so we have the flashing one which I hate
and should never be used and then I
believe we have a more soft fade effect
that it goes through as well
very cool anyway and then of course back
to solid color so if I switch this to
all-white let's do red for example and
then I should be able to change it to
like pulse red pulse flash breathe and
right now it's going very fast so if I
was like that's too fast for me I hit
the speed button and then it slows down
a little bit gives me something a little
bit more reasonable now apart from those
lights there are also a couple highlight
lights so down here at the very bottom
we've got the Corsair logo has a white
LED behind it so that shines through the
front of the case I thought that was a
nice touch and then of course that
Corsair logo on the power supply so even
if you're not using a Corsair power
supply you've still got a Corsair power
supply those are both white it's kind of
a shame that those are so also aren't
RGB with everything else but if you're
going to have it be any colors white
would be the best choice since you have
different colors going on okay we had a
brief emergency with the dogs but
everything seems to settle down now
continuing on though just some final
comments about the fact that everything
is tempered glass on this case all right
one is going to be that you are going to
be dealing with fingerprints now if you
have used plexi yes flexi will get
fingerprints as well nice thing here is
that you can just wipe them off with the
with a nice cloth and you shouldn't get
any micro scratches or anything like
that again since its tempered glass but
it also kind of makes it a little bit
more difficult to find good places to
pick up the case I noticed like for
instance I almost grabbed it down here a
couple times which would not be a good
thing I really you want to grab from
underneath and just lift on the bottom
like you would with a with a box or
something like that
mainly because these mounts specifically
for the front one here and the top one
here have kind of standoffs
from the actual panel that they're
connected to and those are plastic and
then the like the I'm sorry the tempered
glass is mounted to the plastic those
seem like they might be a little flimsy
over time they were at
quit but I would want to be delicate
with them and you definitely want to
like lift by right here because that
would put some serious strain on those
and you might snap off the little
mounting points a nice little touch
though that I noticed was that the
tempered glass pieces are either a bit
more squared or a bit more rounded and
that is so that they will go up flush
nicely with the different parts of the
case like this little connective piece
right here you want the squared off one
so that stays clean
same thing with right here and then
whereas at the bottom this one has the
rounded corner because it's kind of
floating out in space and that makes
more sense same thing on this one more
squared corner down here at the bottom
where it meets up with the other
elements of the case whereas it's got
the rounded corner up here at the top
which Jen yeah it just looks nicer I
think it's a nice touch as far as
airflow goes you are going to be dealing
with a mainly open air type of chassis
you're not going to really have much in
the way of pressure building up in here
pretty much because everywhere that
these tempered glass pieces sits there
is a gap to some degree so it's pretty
much just open between those which is
fine but I actually think that the
intake configuration that they have with
three fans just up front is going to be
just fine okay remove the side panel
windows to give a few comments on the
interior the first thing you might
notice is my 280 millimeter radiator
here at the top was not it was a little
too big
mainly I was dealing with a space
clearance between the heatsink for the
vrm on the motherboard and the fan here
so I'm actually still running it but I
only have a single fan attached here I
was able to get enough clearance by
removing that second fan what I was
going to do is just grab a 140 or 120
millimeter rad and put it up here up
there then I realize that I can still
fit this so I'll just do it just to show
you guys
that's a 280 millimeter radiator it does
have some shift shift ability this way
and that way but not forward to back so
you definitely will have some issues
with certain motherboards with clearance
particular up particularly up in this
area and there's no space up above here
to mount fans or anything like that so I
would say stick with a 280 up top for
most people unless you're really trying
to figure out how to wedge something in
there or you really have a lot of
clearance for your motherboard up top
beyond that you do have tons of space up
here in the front
for like you know 242 8360 so that would
be probably a better option if you
really needed a lot of radiator space in
here or again just stick with that 240
on top now I also want to say for the
power supply shroud area down here you
can kind of see through it back there a
little bit and this is really one of the
main areas to tuck away extra cables so
you can see a little bit through there
but I find that it wasn't really too big
of a deal I'd much rather have the
shroud there than not of course one
thing I found particularly annoying was
the lack of any cable routing areas
through here on this side of the
motherboard in this corner there's
really nothing so all these cables you
pretty much have to run across here and
then get back to tuck back into the
cables this direction it's not that big
of a deal but there's nothing to really
tie them down to so I was dealing with
this situation where I just had to try
to lay them as flat as possible and tuck
them back there a minor gripe but
something that I've gotten a little bit
more used to on some other cases there
is fortunately a pass-through up there
at the top for your Aitken CPU connector
and finally a look at the ever-important
cable management area here at the back I
invested a decent amount of time in
cable management but definitely wasn't
as incredibly thorough as I could have
been because they have done some nice
things like putting tie-down points all
the way around the edge of the CPU
cutout on the motherboard tray
and they've given you a decent amount of
options given that you're really limited
on where you can hide stuff again most
of your extra cables are going to need
to be tucked away in here as best you
can so that might mean that I not quite
as long power supply it would be a
better option to at least give you a
little bit more room back there
I like how you can have fancy nice SSDs
displayed right here or even mechanical
drives if you're into that or SSDs even
right there and that people can actually
see your storage which is often tucked
away and then the cable management's
routing kind of bar thing here I like
that it's removable it does a good job
keeping everything tidy and tucked away
in there but it was as kind of would be
expected a pretty decent amount of work
to get everything routed properly to
really have it mostly through there and
then any excess cable kind of doubling
back in there and whatnot but the fact
that you can remove it with those thumb
screws and then pop it back on once you
have everything routed was definitely a
bonus a benefit and I I liked that
method and as you probably saw as I was
doing the
there are velcro straps at least in a
couple places behind here so as you're
writing stuff you can kind of cinch it
down and get it to the point where you
can actually put that piece back on oh
and I also shouldn't go without
mentioning this the fan hub is not
technically necessarily a fan hub so
don't consider using it as a fan hub
this controls only the LED lighting and
although it can control up to six fans
those fans need to have these plugs
which are proprietary I believe from
Corsair coming off them to go into the
controller that's just for the LEDs and
they also have three more individual
three pin fan plugs coming off of them
that you will need to plug into the
motherboard or some other source of
power so bear that in mind if you're
planning on using this as your fan hub
know it's only for the LEDs so that
that's not a bad thing but don't don't
be buying this thinking it has a fan hub
integrated okay actually one final final
thing and that is that this does not
have a reset button so bear that in mind
as well no reset and actually no hard
drive led connector either so all you
have is the power button and when your
system goes to sleep like mine is right
now that will flash which is pretty
normal for a system that has gone to
sleep and just so you know this little
LED down here is connected to that too
so that will also act as your flashing
power LED and that just about wraps it
up for this video guys once again this
has been the corsair 5 70 x from their
crystal series featuring tempered glass
on RGB fans as well as a lighting
controller this case cost about a
hundred and seventy nine dollars MSRP i
don't think i've mentioned that yet so
let me know in the comments section what
you think of that price if you think
it's worth it for this case also let me
know what you think of the tempered
glass thing it seems to be a trend
that's been gaining some steam much like
the RGV thing started to gain a bunch of
steam last year I don't mind the
tempered glass but I'm certainly still
warming up to having tempered glass on
every side of the case but it does
provide a little bit more of a challenge
when you're doing a builds and you know
that you're going to have a very clear
view of that opposite side with the
cable management so perhaps a case for
people who have done this a few times
and are confident and their cable
management skills once again they'll
leave me comments in the comment section
let me know what you think of this case
and the tempered
thing also down in the description you
can find links to my store where you can
buy shirts mugs and pen glasses to help
the cause and of course hit the thumbs
up button if you enjoyed this video and
I'll post a link to this case as well
down in the description as well as a
list of all the parts that I used thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
