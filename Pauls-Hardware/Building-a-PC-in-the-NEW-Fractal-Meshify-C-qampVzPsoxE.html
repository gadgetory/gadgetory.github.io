how's it going guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be a quick case review video this is the
fractal design mesh if I see brand-new
case and it bears some strong
similarities to the fractal design
define seat however this case features a
tempered glass side panel a newly
redesigned front panel it's a bit of a
different sort of look for fractal so
I'm going to be doing a quick unboxing
of it give you guys a once-over build a
quick system and then I'll come back
with my thoughts at the end so the
measure 5c comes pretty well packed and
what you would expect I would think for
a mid tower computer case of this
caliber this is going to MSRP for $90
$89.99 to be more specific and you'll
notice a pretty familiar box like
aesthetic like you might have recognized
from some other fractal cases that have
come out in the past however the thing
that stood out to me of course the most
at the beginning probably the the source
of the mesh if I see name is this mesh
panel that they have here across the
threads now this is they've added like
tessellation so there is some texture
there it definitely gives it a unique
characteristic I think haven't really
seen a front panel design that's like
this but even though it does have you
know all those angles in there and
everything it's not necessarily like it
stands out too terribly bad I've seen
this done with like plastic panels
before and had it looked pretty horrible
but in this case I kind of liked it
actually
of course that's an aesthetic thing so
people are going to either love it or
hate it so of course leave comments in
the comment section let us know whether
or not you liked this actual design but
the goal here is to provide plenty of
airflow so this is a completely mesh
panel there is some foam behind it so it
is going to allow some air to pass
through it's going to act as a dust
filter and then you might also notice
there's a fractal design logo down here
in the lower left that's on a silver
background so the fractal logo does
stand out just a little bit more and
beyond that it is the same typical frame
from the define see for example at the
top for i/o you have a typical power and
reset button mic and headphone jack as
well as a couple us
3.0 ports at the very tops there is a
mesh magnetic cover this is another dust
filter this is more to keep dust from
falling down into the case since that's
probably going to be exhausted top but
some magnets will hold it in place
slides down a little bit but it is
recessed so kind of stay there what it
is where it should be
I'll take the tempered glass side panel
off in just a second but that does come
with a clear protective sheet of plastic
over it I've left the glass warning
there for the time being and it has four
black thumb screws that hold it in place
and it has some rubber mats in there
that also keep it from banging on the
actual metal there since the case is
made of steel and plastic otherwise and
I here at the back you can see pretty
standard i/o layout ATX case so seven
expansion slots the case ships with two
fans once winning at the back for
exhaust as well as 120 at the front for
intake those are fractal dynamic GP 12
fans by the way and then for your power
supply Mountain down here at the bottom
it actually has a removable piece so you
can insert that power supply from the
back since it does have a power supply
shroud inside amid would make it a
little bit more difficult to mount that
way
captain thumb screws on these four that
mount for the power supply as well as
for the opposite side
side panel so I can top that off really
quick this doesn't come with the sound
dampening pieces like that the standard
defined series comes with so bear that
in mind
although they are very sturdy as you
would expect from fractal and of course
all made of steel take a quick look at
dr the expansion you have this panel
here at the back that can support up to
three 2.5 inch drives mechanical drives
or SSDs and then there's a little caddy
down here in the lower left which
currently has the accessories pocket in
it so you can actually fit two more 3.5
inch drives down there again pretty much
the same layout that you had a need to
find seat like to define to you as well
there's tons of cable management
tie-down points back here there is this
channel here for thicker cables it does
have a series of fractal velcro strips
with it to help keep those in place
really good and really easy for cable
management especially considering that
once you do get everything in there
there's plenty of room to suck extra
cables in at the bottom of the case
hidden by the power supply shroud now
flipping back around here to the front
just to finish off the dust filtration
capabilities of this case there is a
long dust filtration cover here at the
bottom and covers
the entire bottom of the case so if you
have an intake fan you can mount 120
millimeter intake fan towards the front
of the case at the bottom right up here
or your power supply this covers both of
those and it's nice to be able to access
that completely from the front of the
case and once you've got that popped off
just like most cases with a plastic
front bezel you can grab the front here
and you can remove that now the cabling
does stay attached there so I can't pull
this all the way off but there's your
front panel and here's how you would
access the dust filter here it actually
has just a plastic tab at the bottom
that you kind of lift and pops out to
the front and then two plastic tabs to
catch and hold it onto the front as well
and then it can access that if you
needed to clean this again this has a
metal grille that's on the front it also
has some foam padding back in there as
well which I would imagine might kill a
little bit of the noise but also of
course is going to catch more dust that
might be pulling in through the front
here with that off you can also see the
hundred twenty millimeter intake band
that's creamed out today at the front
this isn't the easiest dust filter to
get to since you do have to pull this
front piece off partially so not the
best implementation however it does give
you tons of airflow and you can access
that whole thing for popping it off to
clean it up now let's get the tempered
glass side panel piece off a pretty
standard piece of grey glass here there
is a bit of I want to say paint here on
the inside to kind of corner off the
edges so it's nice it's effective is but
a little bit extra effort in here rather
than just making it a tempered glass
piece there's also two pads strips on
the top on the bottom for where it
actually makes contact case which should
help reduce and prevent vibration
against that so those would make contact
with these pads is actually stripped
here and a strip here that's also foam
so that's a great way for that to make
contact and then the mounting points
here for those thumb screws are also
rubberized so it hasn't been vibrating
or banging around at all on me so I
think that's a pretty good deal and here
you can actually see the shroud for the
power supply goes all the way across the
bottom there is an extra panel here
towards the front you can remove that or
you can leave it in place depending on
what you do with that as for fan support
you can do up to 620 millimeter fans to
at the top three at the front one at the
bottom
40 million million frames you can jump
the floor to at the top and two at the
front now with all that said I think I'm
just about ready to start a quick build
in this case I will point out the stand
up so it does come with a center stand
off with the fixed spot so it will hold
your motherboard in place once it's in
there rest of the standoffs are not
installed though so those will be in
here with the accessories I have to
imagine accessories also include a set
of zip ties your screws for matching
your motherboard and then oh look
they're individually packaged so I've
got some standoff screws for mounting
hard drives you got screws for mounting
a Paris flat the back does come with the
nice little wifey cloth to wipe off all
of those fingerprints after you get your
build all done with and then you've got
the rest of the standoffs as well as a
standoff nut for tightening tightening
them Thank You fractal for including
that it's also metal that's cool and
then the rest of the screws which you'd
use for mounting 2.5 inch tracks that is
a nice quick introduction to this case
though let me build a system in here and
I'll be back in just a minute and I'll
let you guys know how it went
so there you have it guys my build is
now complete in the fractal define
measure 5c and went pretty smoothly as
expected real quickly I wanted to point
out some of the size limitations that
are in here I was specifically built
with the pretty large size GPU and a
pretty large size air cooler for GPU
length you can have up to 300 15
millimeter GPUs that's with the front
fan mounted for CPU cooler height up 272
millimeters and then for power supply
length up to a hundred and seventy-five
milliliters so there was plenty of space
for all that stuff that I have in here
as for hardware installed I have the
Asus X 370 - s gaming motherboard it's
an amp or motherboard this is primarily
an AMD system I have a risin 5 1600 CPU
the GPU is also an asus rog strix this
is an RX 580 graphics card the CPU
coolers a tenner max ET st 40 the memory
is from g.skill they tried and tried an
x series and then for storage I have a
patriot hellfire 480 gig nvme SSD I
haven't done much configuration with the
system but the stock fans are running
pretty quiet right out of the gate they
both just plugged directly into the
motherboard so they're being controlled
by the motherboard software and then
everything is for our scale management
fit in there really nice and that was
thanks to the extra cable management
channeling areas we had at the back
pretty much a very similar experience to
the one that I had when originally
building in the design seat let's
quickly run down pros and cons though
for the pros a lot of the stuff that
fractals known for it's got very solid
construction very solid steel it's not
really thin gauge or anything like that
there's metal in a lot of places where a
lot of other cases tend to skimp on that
such as the metal drive cages down at
the bottom as well as a metal hardware
that's included such as the CPU standoff
tightener which is very nice to have
also having what is now another tempered
glass case a side panel option from
tractable is pretty cool
all I would say that this tempered glass
piece does have a fairly dark tint so
moving over to comms the dark tint on
the tempered glass does make it a little
bit more challenging to see inside so I
would recommend if you're going that
that route to choose internal components
that maybe light up a little bit more
they're a little bit more distinct I do
have some lights on the graphics card
and the motherboard but adding for
instance maybe some case fans with LEDs
on them or
the g.skill RGB memory for example would
make a lot of stuff in there stand out a
bit more
of course flip side to that is that some
people want things to be subtle in there
so that might've been where Fraggle was
going for since they like to have sort
of a a more subtle aesthetic the darker
glass might be something that they did
intentional for that so it really is up
to your preference which is also the
same thing you could say about that
front mesh design I kind of like it I
think it turned out pretty good but it's
not going to be for everyone and it's
really going to come down to your
preferences when it comes to aesthetics
a couple other things to point out would
be that that front mesh panel is kind of
difficult to get at it's not like one of
the things you can just pop off so
something to consider there if easy
access to dust filters is something that
you're very concerned about and then if
I had another thing to add here
definitely a USB 3.1 front panel
connector instead of the USB 3.0 the
three Flint ones are a lot nicer and it
would have been cool to see that
included here as well but perhaps a new
version will come in the future that has
that integrated too so ultimately I
think I like this case I think some of
the visual stuff comes down to whether
or not you approve of it but overall I
think fractal has done a pretty good job
here and coming in at less than 100
bucks eighty nine ninety nine MSRP is
pretty nice too but guys that's going to
wrap it up for this video thank you so
much for watching if you enjoyed it hit
the thumbs up button and leave me a
comment in the comment section let me
know what you think of this case let me
know if you have a build coming up soon
because it is the fall season I think
people are going back to school and I
think there's a good reason to build new
computers out right now too with a lot
of the new launches recently and okay
thanks so much again for watching this
video and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
