monthly builds video for September 2016
each month I create a couple computer
build parts lists based on your votes
and feedback from the previous month
so last month I did a straw poll
everybody voted about what builds they
wanted to see this month and look what
1/4 way gtx titan x pascal just cause so
that's what i'm gonna be doing today i
also did the second runner-up the $500
basic bang for the buck back to the
school build so those are the two builds
we're going to be seeing and if you want
to vote for next month's for october the
link is down in the description i'm
going to do a mid to high end $1,500
gaming pc with windows if you're
noticing noises going on the background
that's here oh he's stretching out and
relaxing spooky halloween themed build
dual system living room build anyway
check those out and vote if you want to
see one or one or more of them anyway
before I move on to the David and
Goliath systems from this month I want
to also point out that back in July I
started actually building one of these
systems every month I have actually not
yet built the 3500 system that I teased
for August
mainly because Corsair asked if I wanted
to build in a new case gem trick well
here I moved into a really inconvenient
position here oh you're in the way
it's very cool can you scooch over just
a little bit alright now you're coming
over here to say hello
yes your your cutest no more no build
videos will just give you pets good boy
stay Wow
anyway though first they asked if wanted
to build it in a new case that's right
here this is the air 740 from Corsair it
is also a cube style case it is brand
new but it's very similar to the air 540
that I had chosen for last month's build
so I'm going to be building in that and
that will be in the next couple days
actually I'm probably going to do that
live tomorrow if everything goes
according to plan so I'll be tweeting
about that so follow me at Paul Hardware
on Twitter if you want to check that out
but anyway back to my monthly build so
I've been doing this for quite some time
actually I have my whole history right
here going to back to all of my builds
but these are the two for this month
again the Goliath $15,000 build and then
a much much much more reasonable $500
bill we'll start off with the $500 build
right here by the way I'm using PC part
picker for all these
so those links will be in the
description as well as individual links
to all the products used this is
actually a less than five hundred dollar
bill came out to four hundred and
seventy one dollars and ninety cents
with shipping on PC part picker starting
off with an IEEE 360 103 point 7
gigahertz dual-core CPU available for
around 110 to 115 dollars and this is a
dual core and it is a lower-end skylake
cpu but it does still very good
instructions per clock it's got a really
nice out-of-the-box frequency 3.7
gigahertz and if I didn't already
mention it does have hyper threading so
it will give you four threads so it can
fool some games that require four cores
into thinking you actually have four
cores even though you might not now my
original intent with the system was to
make the entire thing upgradable so that
you could add a bit more money later on
but I kept coming up against these
choices of budget versus slightly more
money for a little bit more upgradable
thing and I eventually just decided to
go all budget so for example with the
motherboard it's a be 150 chipset so
upgrading to an unlocked processor isn't
really gonna I mean you could but you
don't really want to you could still
upgrade the processor you just won't be
able to overclock in the future but
sixty bucks for that is a really good
price for in a nice little micro ATX
motherboard I've used a similar
motherboard to this and builds in the
past again it'll just kind of get the
job done
it is lacking in some features so you've
only got two DIMM slots for example so
you're only did a single stick of memory
so you can still expand the memory
there's only a single fan header so
you'll want to keep that in mind as well
just make sure you get a splitter or
something to use if you need to plug in
all your case fan headers and no MDOT
two or anything fancy but upshot is it's
going to get the job done and it's only
60 bucks for memory I just went with a
single stick of g.skill Aegis eight gig
this is only $34 this is this was a
dollar or two more than a comparable
green PCB stick so I did see I did spend
a little bit more money so that I
wouldn't have a green PCB component in
there but again this will get the job
done and I went with a single stick
because eight gigs I feel like is a good
jumping-off point for a gaming PC and
you can just drop in a second stick for
another thirty four dollars in the
future if you want to for the SSD and
yes I only included an SSD in here it's
240 gigs and if you're worried about not
having enough space my assumption is
always that people
have an old hard drive a one or two
terabyte hard drive lying around
somewhere that they can use and I'd much
rather have the fast SSD working even
with 240 gigs you can it's operable for
a while if you don't have additional
storage and this 8081 just keeps being
the best price option out there it's not
the fastest 2.5 inch SATA SSD I keep
saying the same thing every time but it
is only 58 59 dollars at NCIX right now
for 240 gig version and then finally for
the graphics card and one that you get
by trading on rx for 60 this is the 4
gig version that's 2 gig version I
wanted that extra extra horsepower in
there but it's got a nice design it's
orange in black it's not the you know
crazy well-built or anything like that
but it is an Rx 460 so you know rather
than in my hundred and thirty dollars
ish for this one and if I was going to
take a single component in this build
and upgrade its I wanted to do an RX 470
in here originally but that is about 60
bucks more so that pushed the price up
to more like 530 but consider that as a
serious option if you really are
seriously looking at building this
system oh I said finally but I'm not I'm
not done yet
fractal design core 1100 is the case
micro ATX mini tower again gets the job
done that's only about 40 bucks this is
the 1100 not the 1000 you know nothing
too special but it'll get you up and
running
finally for power supply EVGA 450 watt
80 plus bronze there's other options
down in this range from like Corsair and
Rosewell even but I just keep going with
the EVGA power supplies this one does
not have all black cabling or anything
like that but it's for 150 watts
perfectly adequate for this build and it
is only $37 there are some other options
that were out there from EVGA and a
couple more for 10 to 20 dollars more
that have a little bit better aesthetics
and all black cables and that kind of
thing but again just trying to get
things running so that is the first
build only a little over $470 so let me
know what you guys think of it and let's
move on to the second build which is the
Big Daddy
this is $15,000 or rounded up it
actually costs one thousand four hundred
eighty dollars and 69 cents
one thousand sorry fourteen thousand
eight hundred and thirty dollars and
sixty nine cents so you can round that
up or you know since this really is only
the price for the case and I did have
Windows in there you know use that extra
one hundred and seventy dollars two
years
self-monitor peripherals that will
totally match with everything else here
so I wanted to do something more than
just going sort by highest price for
every single component and throwing it
all in there to make the most expensive
this is believe it or not somewhat
reasonable somewhat that is probably not
exactly accurate but I tried to not just
be like here's the most expensive things
all right so obviously the CPU is going
to be the i7 69 50x yes you could go
slightly cheaper and get yourself like a
69 hundred but then you wouldn't have 10
cores or you could go to Z on route I
cannot go and talk about this without
mentioning the possibility of getting a
crazy high core count Xeon but you won't
be able to overclock those they won't
have quite as good instructions per
clock and really there's just no way
around the six 950 X plus only 16
hundred and fifty dollars that's $50
less than it launched at for 1700 it's a
deal now for cooling of course we have a
Corsair h 110 I if I was being awesome
myself and building a 15 grand system I
would probably do a custom loop for it
but that's a little bit too complicated
for this type of video so the H 110 I
will get the job done and it has our GB
lighting and I know it's just at least
got insert so you can change the color
of it to match a little bit better for
the motherboard this one I was actually
a low I there are quite a few really
high-end motherboards for x99 that cost
five or six hundred dollars each this is
the Asus x99 e WS or workstation and it
is really expensive costs in the $700
range right now although honestly I
think this is a jacked up price because
it's also over on Newegg for just over
five hundred dollars it's even in stock
and everything so I'm not really sure
what the deal is here just don't buy
this on Amazon if you see it but
basically what you have here is an SSI
CEB motherboard so that is a server
specification for the actual layout but
don't worry the case I chose will fit it
this is not a new generation x99 board
this came out back when the first
generation has well ease came out so as
a result you do have an m2 slot which is
kind of up there in the upper right
which you put here let me click on this
thing you have an MDOT - I've got it
rotated the motherboard I'm so confused
M not twos like right here and you've
got of course four-way SLI supports the
thing that this really has and the
reason I chose it is
Dule plx bridges now because from the
cpu you have 40 lanes with a haswell-e
or Broadwell II CPU and that's not
enough because if you're putting
four-way tighten X Pascal's in all four
of your slots then you're using up
thirty-two PCIe lanes right there just
with your graphics card not including
any peripherals or additional storage or
anything else you might add so I wanted
to have as much bandwidth via the PCIe
lanes as possible this is really the
only way to go about it besides that
it's a really nice-looking board and it
over clocks it's it's it's really solid
board I mean all around I don't have too
much more to say about that but anyway
let's move on to the next thing which is
memory 128 gig kit should again
obviously be the obvious solution for
this and I can put anything less than
the max in there here I did save some
money though by going with a vengeance
LP X memory kit Corsair does does have
their Dominator memory which was a good
200 bucks more than this kits
however the Dominator memory wasn't
available this is faster this is 3,000
speed Dominator kit was 2666 i 2800 I
think anyway it's all black it'll blend
in right just just nicely and it's not
as tall too so and it's cheaper this was
again 700 and something versus the
Dominator so I think they might even
have been close up to a thousand so at
this point we have gotten this far down
the list we've got through the first
four items and we've included Oh about
$1,800 for the CPU and cooler another
500 or 700 depending on where you buy it
for the motherboard and then another 750
ish for the memory this is all the
storage here so you'll notice MDOT - SSD
for more SSDs for hard drives and then
of course you got the video cards and
the other stuff down there so let's
continue on with the actual storage I
wanted the fastest and most capacity
rich m2 SSD that I could find and the
OCZ Rd 400 a pretty new SSD in this
range is one terabyte and m2 it doesn't
have the nicest PCB yeah that's kind of
turquoise but it will be covered up by
the fourth Titan next Pascal so don't
worry about too much too much about this
not blending in but one terabyte on a
single m2 stick that's pretty freakin
impressive if you ask me and it
definitely is very good
it speeds as well 2600 megabytes per
second sequential reads 1550 megabytes
per second so punch or writes crazy I
ops as well so that'll do you nice for
like a boot drive and for quite a few
games on it as well
now here's another place where I saved
you some money if you wanted to go with
the very most expensive SSD you can buy
right now it's a 4 terabytes Samsung 850
I'm sorry 850 Evo those costs $1500 each
though and since I was doing four of
them I decided maybe let's save some
money get something slightly more
reasonable so this is the two terabyte
Samsung 850 Pro a much more reasonable
cost of around $800 each and of course I
did four of them giving your you eight
terabytes of presumably raid zero
storage which would be probably even
faster than that ocz drives that I put
in there anyway finally of course we
gotta have the mass storage so 10
terabyte drives is about the biggest you
can get went with four of these Seagate
iron wolf 10 terabyte 3.5 inch 7200 rpm
drives these are made for raid I would
if I had four of these it's 40 terabytes
of storage I probably put it in raid 5
giving myself 30 terabytes usable plus
onedrive for failover of course you
could do like raid 10 though or
something like that as well but I didn't
want to double check this at all can be
able to connect to the motherboard
though so you got your MDOT 2 right here
and then basically you have actually 10
SATA ports via the x99 chipset so for
them for the yes as these and for them
for the those those mechanical drives
and you're good to go let's move along
to the final couple things one of them
is of course going to be that graphics
cards that this is the most boring part
because it was kind of the given tekneqs
Pascal Edition these are $1200 each and
you can only buy them directly from in
video right now so also your limitations
here I'm actually simulating this is
that you can only buy two at a time from
Nvidia so you'll have to get a friend to
buy the other two you have to lend them
$2,400 as well and for the case I went
for case labs I went directly to their
website because they're not listed on PC
part picker the Magnum tth 10a is five
hundred and ninety dollars and you can
customize and stuff like that if you
want things to get fancier case labs
I've never actually used the case labs
case or built in one I've only checked
out J's and everything but they're
insanely both expensive but also worth
the money when it comes to how
well-built they're and everything like
that this one is is available in grey
and it's just got tons of
bass and a bunch of different
orientation options for the motherboard
and all of that good stuff so here as
well as with those those those graphics
cards is where you will also need to
take some extra care when ordering
because due to heavy demand custom
orders are temporarily suspended until
after I guess after July 31st that
should work for now that one go order
case labs cases all right power supply
is EVGA supernova t2 1600 watts no I'm
not paid by EVGA to use all their power
supplies I actually had the courser ax
1500 ion here which is also 80-plus
titanium but it was 1500 watts and when
I looked at my actual parts list which
has gotten buried here among my tabs
again when I looked at it it's a
thousand 51 watts recommended and that
is not including two of the Titan X GPUs
because I had a write in two of them
right here because a PC part picker
wouldn't let me add more than two of
them at a time so yeah I figured just to
be on the safe side we'll go with 1600
watts again it is lady plus titanium
rated all black cables it's going to
look nice etc etc all right got a
blu-ray burner in there just just
because I'm trolling and you know got it
there on everything but the kitchen sink
and finally I even included a $30 ration
for buying Windows 10 on kinguin because
why would you buy Windows 10 anywhere
else unless you want to pay a hundred
bucks plus for it so there it is guys my
$15,000 for wait I'd next build this is
I guess kind of what I would do if I
really was being forced to build a Titan
X 4 way system again there's a lot of
impracticality x' in there there's a lot
of things you could say as far as
aesthetics like custom water cooling or
anything like that but if you got lots
and lots of money and price is no object
and you need the best of the best I
would put the system up against lots of
other ones as far as just being
absolutely crazy and we've even seen
forward technics used in gaming recently
with the video we talked about in the
Alive show this week but guys let me
know if you enjoyed this video a thumbs
up if you did enjoy it again links to
everything is down in the description
whether you want to vote in the straw
polls or click on the links to any of
these products have been talking about
orgeous leave me a comment to let me
know how wrong I was about these parts
or how right I was or just that you're
looking forward to all my upcoming
content this month that'd be cool too
anyway thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
