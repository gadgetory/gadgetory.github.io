in the meantime I am pouring myself some
beer it's a little heady what's a little
heady I didn't mean it I swear I did not
mean any of it
I literally just like barely touched the
cork I did a quarter turn and I was like
I wonder what what happened if like this
I know what I was saying
she's huh they don't even we're gonna
find out momentarily but hello everyone
I'm welcome to awesome hardware this is
a live show we talked about technology
we drink some beer occasionally we curse
and you know adult themes and all that
kind of stuff so if you're young and
easily offended please bear that in mind
you might not want to watch our show
however we already did the first half of
this show which is episode number 120
side a is streamed live to Kyle's
YouTube channel which is known as bit
wit so check that out if you missed it
it should be linked in the video's
description right at the top and during
our break because we take a brief break
between shows so we can recuperate and
sometimes pee and stuff apparently Kyle
made an attempt at opening opening a
bottle this bottle of Shem a grand
reserve right here which was being
streamed to to twitch and we're gonna
we're gonna watch right now
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
oh oh oh oh my god that's gorgeous ah
Wow Wow okay thank you thank you for
clipping that whoever put like that was
so many people crying right now
oh my gloves are freaking out okay so
can we give this on reddit tweet please
get this one front page it was beautiful
oh my beautiful I didn't expect it I
didn't expect it to look like that like
at your eyes I should be like okay wow
I'm right that was incredible I was
absolutely pitiful I am so happy I'm
glad you're not mad cuz I felt really
bad with AC everywhere I wish we could
just end my half right now no way to
follow that you really can't follow this
up everything's gonna be terrible from
now on we're gonna talk about technology
as usual if you guys buy stuff from our
stores we'll give you a shout out David
the show my story's Paul's armored up
net I have now added some pullover
hoodies available in gray some some dark
grey some lighter so this is yeah these
colors as you can see right here so
check that out order some stuff with a
waterproof Oh Michael I'm rich I'm not
sure if it's waterproof
Kyle stories bit with tough tech slash
story mean ask some lady shirts still
got some fidget spinners going as well
as some hats so check those things out
and big thanks lie against help support
us I'm so glad that was recording
because sad would you be if I wasn't
worried
said cuz I yeah it looked it looks so
much worse it was like I just felt like
the the pop was loud and it was
startling and the cork hit my glasses so
I didn't even like hurt me or anything
but I didn't expect it to look at that
let's watch it one more time I didn't
expect it to look that dramatic like the
 sun's just exploding on me
because I couldn't see when that
happened I could not see anything I mean
my vision was completely masked I went
to go pee I want to pee you heard the
pump I heard the dog barking as they go
what happened okay this is the best this
is our best show ever
yeah alright let's attempt to continue
with the show as planned so usually the
second half is a continuation of heck
news and let me pull up my notes so I
can have some vague idea of what I'm
talking about as we go along here but
our first bit of news is sort of a
follow up to something we talked about
on the show before which is this crazy
obsession with super ultra wide monitors
which is apparently continuing with the
production of a 32 by 9 aspect ratio
ultra wide VA panel which is being
developed and is now available not just
from Samsung because we've already
talked about the Samsung version of this
in a previous episode now Phillips has
149 inch 32 by an I know provide curved
VA monitor there's a picture of it right
there and this one's gonna be a little
bit less expensive so that's kind of the
the main thing but Phillips tends to
cater I feel like towards a little bit
more budget budget than the Samsung
premium but this is the Philips 4 9 2 P
8 49 inch VA panel 38 40 by 1080 it's a
resolution 32 by 9 x aspect ratio it is
the same panel used in the about $1500
us ish samsung CH 90 which is a cute LED
this one however should be a little bit
less expensive the article says 899
euros is kind of what they expect the
price to be which is the equivalent of a
hundred
I'm sorry 1075 US dollars or 810 British
pounds this one's more aimed at the the
professional market then say gamers so
they do leave some stuff out to hit that
lower price does not have quantum dot
also might have less HDR compatibility
as far as HDR standards less a lower
maximum refresh rate so maybe they're
harvesting panels that didn't it
couldn't hit higher refresh rates that
the Samsung panels are hitting no free
sync to all these eyes compared to the
Samsung model which is going to be again
$1500 or so so for $400 less you still
get wide viewing angles 178 degrees
pretty good brightness six hundred
candles per square meter and contrast
ratio up to five thousand to one LED
backlight 1800 1800 our curvature srgb
color gamut and a trio of inputs d-sub
hdmi and displayport d-sub very much
indicating that it's geared towards
professionals and people are in
workplaces where you might actually need
a D sub input which wouldn't know D sub
would not be able to hit that resolution
I feel like well you know I'd be curious
what you'd be limited to if you actually
use that ten but you got HDMI and
DisplayPort so for that you're okay
I got USB type-c input that splits into
a couple USB 3.0 type-a connectors a
little hub as well as a 1 gigabit
ethernet Ethernet port which is odd to
me is it just a pass through or is
there's actually an Ethernet adapter
built into the monitor hmm interesting
curious anyway this should be available
in q2 2018 so next year sometime wait so
if it doesn't have free sync to does it
at least have free sync
maybe free sync 1 okay and that just not
some of the benefits of free sync 2 and
the other refresh rates that are
supported and that kind of thing ok I'm
not sure about that it might not have
free sync at all
yeah but as a professional monitor you
know that when you and you wouldn't care
about that right but if you're a gamer
on a budget then maybe you would yeah
okay here is a scandal that has prompted
the FTC to crackdown on social media
influencers you guys are probably
somewhat familiar with the scandal in
question which is Trevor T Martin Martin
Ben Thomas syndicate Cassell there csgo
lotto website and the skins that they
were selling in the fact that they were
advertising them to their viewers
without disclosing that they were
actually owners of the company selling
the skins and the first place was pretty
shady they got a huge they got in a lot
of trouble over it culminating in the
FTC actually settling charges against
them this is the first time that the FTC
has civil charges against individual
social media influencers Wow and it also
sets into a new precedent for social
media influencers just to clarify Kyle
and I are social media influencers know
what what precedents we don't want to be
we didn't try to be it just happens yeah
but that's how we're labeled so
potentially we are subject to some of
are we being hunted I hope that it says
yes it's open season on social media
influencers
now No so yeah basically influencers
need to unambiguously disclose their
connections to brands and companies that
they happen to be promoting so there's a
list here in the actual article such as
clearly disclosed when you have a
financial or family relationship with a
brain that's if you're getting paid or
like I recently did a video on monoprice
sit-stand desks and my wife works for
monoprice so I was very careful to say
at the beginning the video by the way
guys my wife works from on open right so
that's why I said that don't assume
followers know all your brand
relationships ensure your sponsorship
disclosure is hard to miss don't assume
disclosure is built into social media
platforms are sufficient so if I tweeted
hey guys have this great collaboration
going with this company and then I did a
video about it but I didn't say anything
about in the video I can't say well
that's we did about it thanks that's
okay you have to be very clear about
that kind of thing you treat sponsored
tags including tags and pictures like
any other endorsement and a lot of this
goes towards the Instagram side of this
because Instagram is huge as far as the
models and other Instagram influencers
who have huge amounts of followers who
do show products and that kind of thing
without necessarily saying by the way
they gave me five grand yeah on the side
to like happen to be a good yep like if
shimei if shimei had paid us for kyle of
the blasts that the thing in his face
right now we would have had to tell you
yep but as it happens shimei just got
that advertising for free of charge
yeah and we paid it could have made so
much money of that moment I know we
should have monetized that terrible
businessman anyway but we'll always tell
you guys whether or not we are making
money from the stupid stuff that we do
so yeah don't use ambiguous disclosures
like thanks hashtag collab hashtag SP
hashtag SPE really really irritates me
like that what didn't even know what
that is hashtag is it's short for spun
spun soared
as tag SPO n which also is stupid or
hashtag ambassadors no actually yeah
that's all you need to do I've seen
hashtag ad and I think hashtag ad people
understand that yeah
ad is an advertisement I think that's
pretty unambiguous but other other
things where you like you're not you're
trying to like soften it and be like oh
we're friends yeah yeah hashtag thanks
is ridicu yeah on image only platforms
like snapchat superimposed disclosures
over the images i'm this is gonna be
something for snapchat Instagram whores
I mean a big issue for I mean we talked
about the Kardashians a little bit on
calset yeah half of the show yeah like
if they can pay for something like
they're gonna need to be there on the
actual image right and that the tracks
it makes sense from that type of
advertising because they wanted to
appear organic and like they just happen
to like this yeah but anyway
don't rely on disclosure is that people
will see only if they click more as well
so it needs to be above the fold the FTC
has also contacted something like 21
unnamed Instagram influencers more
specifically so we would assume these
are high profile people with big follow
follow follow follower pools yeah
Fellowship's large followings yes okay
follow orgies with orgies yes um so yeah
I think this is an information I think
this is okay I think this is what the
FTC is supposed to do and I think when
it comes to advertisements they should
people should know they're being
advertised to you shouldn't be tricked
into having something advertised to you
and I hope that we do a good job at
telling you guys what's an ad and what's
not we do I have kind of an example from
this because I did a video recently on
an lg tv that they sent me a review
sample for yes and allow seams of
dollars they pay a lot of people a lot
of people in the cup but they paid me
zero dollars Oh zero dollars dollars but
people in the comments were like
complaining that it was like this mister
this is an ad and you should have said
upfront that LG sponsored you for this
video but they didn't really sponsor me
for the video the
sent me a review sample and I gave my
honest two cents on it no disrespect to
Jay but this is exactly what we I feel
like a lot of us do for other tech parts
too like a video cards for example video
cards I never openly state oh I was sent
this product for free to review but no
one ever gives a about a video card
but the second they see like a 4k TV or
something like why don't you why were
you up probably this cow why are you
upfront like we handled that product
exactly the same as every other PC DIY
component we get in but yet no one bats
an eye for that stuff so there's there's
a fine line there but if LG did pay me
for some sort of campaign fund or
whatever and they like gave me 500 bucks
or 1,000 bucks for anything for that
video then it would have been made
upfront either in the video verbally or
it would have been within the first
three lines of the description so you
can immediately see it when you click on
the video at any rate that's kind of how
I feel like you and I pretty much run
our channels more or less the same way
we have sort of a similar mentality to
that again
every one is a little bit different some
people color outside of the lines
whatever syndicate Tom dude here with
the csgo Lyle thing you know but it's
good that FTC is taking is taking a role
in all this because I feel like it's
such a new sort of medium with social
media and stuff that it needs to be
regulated in some way so yeah I mean no
and I would agree there as far as I mean
I can say personally as far as
advertisements go anytime I have a
sponsorship it's for a short ad at the
very beginning of the video and that's
also in the very top line of the
description and then beyond that when
products are provided for a review
that's also disclosed in the description
as far as these products are provided by
X company or Y company or that kind of
thing but those aren't necessarily
products that are provided as a
sponsorship a sponsorship would be
saying like hey you want to do a video
on our product and you'd be like I don't
know about that how about we pay you
2,000 bucks okay yeah maybe I'm
interested now if you're doing a video
that you wouldn't have otherwise done
because you got paid money by a company
to do a video on that product then that
is a sponsored video exactly and that is
where the thing
timaeus between its closing as far as
here's a product that was set for view
here's money I was paid to feature
something that I would not necessarily
otherwise have featured right but that's
a distinction that it's up to us to be
as clear as possible about yeah and um
hopefully us discussing it will help
anyone who might not be sure how that's
supposed to work should work yeah anyway
we've been drinking so let's move on to
stuff that's less less legally binding
here's a quick story about Tesla's
autopilot the pilot there was a fatal
Model S crash that was actually last
year this has already been discussed and
talked about because this was one of the
last year yes one of the few the freeway
one yeah this was one of the few fatal
Model S crashes but is this is actually
of course having an impact on how
autonomous vehicles operate going
forward worse and especially how
government plays a role in that because
there's obviously some question as far
as regulation and that kind of thing so
specifically the National Transportation
Safety Board met recently just to
discuss this 2016 fatal Tesla Model S
crash this actually occurred on May 7th
2016 on the US Highway 27 a near
Williston Florida Joshua Brown was the
driver of the vehicle and they said he
was overly reliant on Tesla's autopilot
function and interacted with the car
only seven times in 37 minutes while
traveling at 74 miles per hour the
highway he was on is a four-lane highway
with an eastbound and westbound line
lanes separated only by a grass median
so this is one of those distinctions
that you wouldn't necessarily think
about unless you were talking
specifically about its auto pilots
autonomous vehicles and how they work
and how they might be able to work in
some situations but not at others if
you're on a split Highway that has an
actual physical barrier between either
side of the highway there's no
possibility for any cross
going out of the way so an auto a UI
that's running an autopilot for an
autonomous vehicle or a semi autonomous
vehicle might be able to have more
leeway in that situation then in this
situation where there was only a grass
median mm-hmm which allowed in this case
the four-lane highway it was four-lane
highway and a tractor-trailer made a
left-hand turn across the path of the
Tesla onto a side road the truck driver
failed to yield to the oncoming car
the Tesla at the trailer in its middle
the clusion sheared the roof from the
electric for the top of the Tesla as you
can see pretty graphically and the image
here it also continued another 300 feet
down the road before slamming into
utility pole and the driver died this
was a 2015 model s using the original
mobile I sourced hardware and running
Tesla's firmware 7.1 the system works
like a lot of another other adaptive
cruise control lane that keeping
software this is what is commonly are
sort of known as level 2 semi autonomous
driving side link to another article
here mainly because it has a nice image
that I can show you guys here so we've
briefly discussed this before but just
to refresh your memory in case you're
not sure varying levels of up autonomy
autonomy yes that would be the word
autonomy when it comes to a driverless
vehicle level zero of course is no
autonomy at all level 1 would be
longitudinal longitudinal or transverse
guide so basically either it's doing
lane corrections so like left to right
motion and keeping you in your lane or
something like a cruise control
moderating your speed mm-hmm level 2 is
both of those at the same time so you
could potentially have both your hands
and eyes off of the wheel your car would
look at the lanes in front of you and
correct the wheels to keep you in the
lane and would also look at potential
vehicles in front of you to keep you
driving at the proper speed and this is
actually what my wife's car has more or
less yeah level two which is
she has a super out back so it has a
link and a link correction thing I know
I don't let do the thing where it
actually will keep you in the lane
it just warns me if I'm strolling out of
the lane and then it's got the adaptive
cruise control which monitor is a car in
front which is pretty nice right now the
jump from level 2 to level 3 is what's
be presenting sort of a challenge here
and this is where where Tesla has
provided some kind of more level 3
functionality which is what sort of
maybe got this guy into the situation
granted I mean there's some user error
of course it should also be taken into
account here but this is where you can
have your hands off the wheel and your
eyes don't need to be on the on the road
but the level 3 the vehicle needs to be
able to prompt you to take over if you
need to okay and it needs to be able to
do that on a moment's notice right so
you can't necessarily be sitting in the
backseat watching a movie or whatever
must be instant you know you can be up
in the front doing I don't know
something on your smart front of that
kind of thing right you still need to be
aware and be able to take control the
wheel on the pedal yeah at a moment's
notice okay so there's a lot of
questions right now going on about like
a lot of the vehicles with level 3
outside of me that they're introducing
have actual direct monitoring of you so
it's looking at your face and seeing
like oh is he
dozing off right and also the question
of how long it can go before you
actually take some action right so for
the driver of the of the Tesla for
example and a limited action had like it
has a torque meter on the actual
steering wheel so it can tell if you
adjusted this doing well or something
like that so that's how it's is that
what like Model S's are at Keuka there's
level 3 or technically it's level 2
technically it's level 2 but what but
but that what they're saying is that a
lot of the level a lot of the Tesla
autopilot functionality that they've
introduced has made people treat it like
level fantasy and and that's where
there's maybe some questions of cost
yeah of course they can update how the
software works and how the autopilot
works through
over-the-air updates and that kind of
thing which is useful but a lot of
companies are actually skipping over
level three entirely to level four which
is hands-off mind off the driver and
intervention no take of a request it's
pretty much autonomous but we're not
going to hit level four until more
vehicles have the vehicle to vehicle
communication communication implemented
which yeah is actually a standard that's
been around for quite some time and I
believe it was introduced prior to 2010
mm-hmm
but it's just something that's taking a
little bit while a little while longer
for vehicles to have introduced but
probably something you're going to be
seeing more and more of if you're buying
a car is even if the car doesn't have
the autopilot functionality and the you
know level 3 or level 4 automatic driver
functionality your car might still have
that function to be like hey this is
ready for the time in the future when
the government says if your vehicle
doesn't have vehicle to vehicle
communication even if even if it's not
autonomous at all your vehicle needs to
be able to contact other autonomous
vehicles that are on the road and so
that they can navigate around you right
and know what you're doing sure and that
is going to be a thing yeah soon the
2020s is probably what we're looking at
with with like all cars in general or
with just testing specifically assume
with all cars in general nice I can't I
can't I don't want to speak anymore on
that because I'm looked up enough to say
definitively but yeah that's kind of
what's coming eventually we won't need
any driver at all yes venomous we'll
just have the car go to Vegas and cover
CES for us well that's then we'll have a
robot we'll have the YouTube robot acts
like us I guess and goes out and does
all the coverage for us and a beacon
that'll be awesome that'll be the day
then the robot will come back and human
okay we'll stop into bed with our wives
and before buttering and then murder
them stupid
killer robots let's move on to a new
segment yeah Eggman's on my half yeah
that's right it's called phony news
phony news
yes it's news about phone about phones
is it about like fake phones no phony
phony phony phony phony related a phony
definitely sounds better than phone yeah
exactly
I'm digging it Hey well there's intact
Liam and you like it there's definitely
been a lot of phone news I mean it is a
day when you might think hey let's talk
about let's talk about phones a little
bit so uh so here goes let's start out
all right
Intel and Qualcomm have been doing a lot
of work and a lot of focus on 5g
promising a better customer experience
this article here from telecom lead com
specifically says that a recent 5g
consumer survey conducted by Qualcomm
revealed that 48% of respondents are
likely to purchase a smartphone that
supports 5g when available now a lot of
that might just be for early adoption or
just because people like to have
compatibility with whatever the next new
thing is but Intel's 5g mobile trial
platform in specific is what they've
actually been testing out since they are
still working on the universal standards
for or 5g it's not completely set in
stone yet yeah but doing tests and
providing proof of concepts is
definitely a useful thing so they're
developing 5g with evolving
third-generation partner partnership
projects 3gpp standards which you guys
might be familiar with this will enable
collaboration between carriers their
ecosystems and the standards bodies that
are creating the world of 5g now 5g as
far as the actual band bandwidths the
excuse me the spectrum bands that it
operates within is actually going to
operate on a variety of different
spectrum bands because different
spectrums are available or less
available the
you know they set aside different parts
of the of the wireless spectrum for
over-the-air TV broadcasts or what have
you it's gonna operate in six different
bands 600 to 900 megahertz so you point
three to four point two gigahertz four
point four 24.9 gigahertz five point one
to five point nine Gertz and
twenty-eight gigahertz and thirty-nine
gogurts
that's six at six different spectrum
bands now in case you're wondering more
specifically what this means to you
Korea has kind of been on the forefront
of this as far as actually deploying 5g
so that people of 5g capable devices
mostly cellphones of course can actually
make use of it
so Korea's LG U+ has demonstrated 5g the
new radio standard at 28 gigahertz or
that's the actual spectrum that they're
operating on with a peak rate of 2.5
gigabits per second mm-hmm which is
pretty fast sounds like a lot yes they
tested this on the urban 5g millimeter
wave networked in the same Sangam
district of Seoul in Korea the 28
gigahertz cell tower produced a downlink
rate of 2.5 gigabits per second at a 1 a
distance of one kilometer from the
actual cell tower and then they tested a
single user scenario which is
impractical because when you're talking
about a cell tower and a crowded
district you're gonna have lots of
different devices actually connecting to
it but as just a test case scenario they
tested the single user communicating
with the tower and hit a peak rate of
eighteen point five gigabits per second
which is pretty damn impressive I mean
that's a hell of a lot faster than most
people have on their home wired network
if you're talking about just a basic
gigabit connection you'd have to go to
10 gigabit or 40 gigabit to actually
surpass that if you're wondering my
South Korea is so on the forefront of 5g
deployments it's because they've made a
huge push to expand the rollout of 5g
leading up to the 2018 Winter Olympics
which are going to be held in
Pyeongchang South Korea from Friday
February 9th to Sunday February 25th
2018
I'm excited about that I like the Winter
Olympics yeah me too I like the super
Jeep I like winter the most really more
than summer Winter Olympics yeah okay no
no I dig them my wife really likes the
figure skating which I don't mind I
think you're shadings pretty epic it's
it's pretty cool
and the let's forget the mean that where
they're doing the thing there's jerking
off the the broomstick into them and the
balls very phallic shuffle no no dang
cool dang it
no I know what you talked about really
so that curling really thank girl in a
chat yes reg reg Eric came up I
literally refers to Chet yeah the
earliest it's just intense its attention
to once the careers competitions yeah
baby gotta love it alright it said that
inks in Korea 5g devices should be
dominant by 2020 again fairly soon
because they're rolling it out so
quickly hopefully in the US and
elsewhere will also have rollout of 5g
as well but of course it needs to be
fully standardized first and that is
what ball command until are pushing
towards Erin all right moving on with
foam new folk pony news okay
I need more beer by the way you do I got
there's more abuse there's two more I
think oh cool or you can click more
that's beautiful I'll switch gears with
some some dead guy how are you you're
looking good can see about finish
yourself you're looking healthy I know
you had a bad experience with it yeah
yeah alright Samsung is hoping to
release a bendable galaxy note next year
which is passing notes 8-bit video here
so look at that hey I got a tip back
wait okay wait wait and see alright wait
why is that bendy that's the whole phone
oh wait it's like to spur
that's amazing Wow really wow that's
that's what they're going for they're
treating this like a beer commercial you
have funny random hot chicks this is a
2014 commercial this commercial is
already a couple years old and this
isn't this is just a flexible LED
display content video that they made but
it's a good demonstration of how a
flexible LED display could be
implemented in a phone for something
that perhaps could be the size of a
notebook that you could use as a phone
then a stand-up sort of environment such
as this or if you had it open as he does
at the beginning here it provides a much
wider display that you can use for
typing or watching video or meteor
playback so it's no screen on the front
instead you have two screens and this
one has a so the bendy part is in the
middle here but it can flatten out
mm-hmm so that if there's no unless gap
there something like something like that
you'd like you'd have if you had a split
screen screen sure or something like
that so they're supposed to actually
introduce a foldable phone in 2018 four
years after they introduced this concept
video of a foldable phone it's supposed
to be released under their flagship
Galaxy Note line they're still
perfecting the technology of flexible o
LED panels so it's probably why we
haven't seen one before now but they do
say that their edge curves le o le D
phones like the Samsung Galaxy edge
whatever ones that have that kind of
kind of rolls off the side it's not
flexible you don't can't move it but it
is curved
they'd say they've been very successful
apparently Mutua which is a thing so um
this is the first time that they've
publicly spoken about plans to actually
launch April foldable phone so
potentially this could be the next big
thing in 2018 flip thumbs are back
everyone next's just not the way you
remember them hey I mean if it flip
phone works like this I think I think
that would be kind of interesting flip
phones get you that girl everyone's
gonna be buying one and if the girl
shoes she's like wow it's so
big like Sybil it's like flexible like
[Laughter]
yeah one of the last phone thing the LGV
30 is it the perfect smartphone for
vlogging perhaps yes if you read this
Engadget article they might tell you yes
this is mainly talking about how LG
actually introduced the LG v 30 their
newest v series phone at IFA last week
they spent about 20 minutes of the 50
minute presentation talking about the
phones dual camera system this is an
actual video from a gadget or just a
screen a clip show now it's got the
wide-angle lens and you know maybe a
suitable vlogging camera especially if
you have some some kind of event for it
or something like that
I don't know I would have more to say
about this that's it sorry
like besides the wide-angle what else is
there if I had that's what I was about
to say if I had more time to review I
would have gone into that it doesn't
have a massive sensor or anything like
that it's still a smaller sensor so it's
not like it's gonna be suddenly
replacing DSLRs or that kind of thing
but they do have a more advanced camera
app that allows you to do other things
such as white balance switching between
manual and autofocus as well as
adjusting stuff pertinent stuff to
photography such as ISO shutter speed
and aperture I think phone like for a
phone to be vlog friendly like these
days if you're like a top-tier blogger
or something it needs to have a
front-facing 4k camera yeah just a rear
and that's that's part of what it's
talking about but that's what does that
one yeah it does okay but that's also
part of what has been a lot of to talk
about the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 mm and
the LGB 30 is potentially going to be a
less expensive alternative to that okay
so the sources in this article claim
that the standard 64 gig model will
retain will retail in South Korea for
ninety nine hundred and forty nine
thousand Korean Won
which is about 883 US dollars which
would be less expensive than the Galaxy
Note 8 which is about 1 million 94,000
Korean Won are about nine hundred and
sixty eight dollars so it's about not
quite a hundred bucks cheaper if you're
looking at the direct Korean conversions
as far as the prices go however and the
u.s. denote it goes for nine hundred and
twenty nine dollars from the Samsung
store if you buy it directly so the
article says they're expecting the B 30
will be eight hundred to eight hundred
fifty dollars so if it offers a
comparable feature set to Samsung's
phone then maybe it might be something
that people might consider as a flagship
from LG that provides you most of the
functionality but I'm sure there are
other cell phone reviewers who do a much
better job than we do who will probably
cover that in more depth nice that's all
the phone news there is for today though
that's a cool thing about every video
leaf but the only interesting phone
things pretty much everything in the
area of smartphones cell phones in
general that was discussed today or as
important I don't know I don't know I
feel like you covered everything
actually all the big news that has to do
with phones this week okay I feel like
it was very very well it's good I'm glad
I'm glad we were thorough in that regard
breaker
yeah beautiful people are still clipping
this like it's been Clifton rousing
cyclist at the clip as I said it's been
clipped a thousand times and that was
recording I know I would have been
disappointed if that how how is it like
life is so effed up that that is my
biggest accomplishment I feel like
that's my biggest accomplishment I mean
you have to embrace the fails when they
happen I think that's what that's the
biggest is on front page of Reddit yes
and goddamnit of all of this come on
alright let's move on to a new segment
another new segment a new segment has
two new segments who people should be
excited about that this new segment is
very simply titled yes no yes no yes or
no oh I like it so reflect we're gonna
talk about some stories some stories yes
other stories no okay it's pretty
straight forward let's hear it
so we're gonna start off here hold on
hold on hold on so um start up with a
back quick story from tech power up
about colorful colorful is a Chinese
brands they have been making graphics
cards for quite a while and apparently
now they are delving into motherboards I
thought they did motherboards for
at the time when Kyle and I were still
working at new egg new egg was talking
too colorful about bringing colorful
products into the US and selling them
via nuoc I don't know if that ever
actually went through or not I'm not
sure um I am not qualified to speak more
on them but look at that motherboard do
you think of that cow oh my god for
mining yes so this is a motherboard yes
a lot colorful has made which is
obviously not adhering to any
specification or standard that currently
exists when it comes to ATX one all
those six be ATX
SSI CEP I mean for the video part yeah
six pins are supplemental power for the
video cards because each PCI Express
connector here the shortest part of the
connector is the power delivery and
that's supposed to be able to provide 75
Watts right you can't just provide 75
Watts full to this many slots via the 24
24 pin inputs gotcha where is its way
for pin we're here isn't it's been
divided up into a dozen or so six pins
that's what's happened you're right
yeah they split it there is no 24 pin
that's silly that's really so so do you
need like three or four power supplies
yeah how many splitters would you need
for this and for the Supplemental CPU
power you've only got a four pin right
there of course yeah
no need no need for any heatsink sign I
have any of your power doesn't it is so
dim slot right there - to the right of
the CPU yeah what bizarre a single s Oh
dim salon yeah that's all yeah I guess
yeah how much memory that's that's a
trip that is really weird all right so
this is a 16 PCIe power inputs eight
PCIe x16 slots this is the CDOT b250 a -
BTC cuz add - BTS going to any
motherboard and it means it's made for
cryptocurrency mining can help plus v
twenty four hundred and eighty five
millimeters long one hundred and ninety
five millimeters wide won't fit in any
case that we the crew there's also one
SATA port on it it's a single single
sampling port Mike Wow god that
quintessential cryptocurrency mining
motherboard it's pretty epic so this is
horrendous no basically no no no no
colorful herbal gold I uh oh
how can they possibly make this any
shitty air
alright so no we're gonna sell tons of
these No
oh how does this work though like can
you have like where are you gonna just
hook up like three or four power
supplies like rule 16 P say e well a lot
of crypto miners do that already because
they have to provide power to like you
know eight graphics cards in a situation
right normally you wouldn't have to do
that for so there's ways of doing that I
don't know how power delivery and this
is insane and here's a question or GPU
is running for cryptocurrency mining I
have no idea
are they all running at a hundred
percent GPU load or are they lower than
that
do you know what if no if you're mining
are they at 100% load all the time now
right no they don't require the full X
out yeah well they require full power
delivery they don't require full
bandwidth as far as I see ie slot so
that's why most most crypto rigs that
you see will have you know like issues
is coming out with one that has 18
connection PCIe by one you actions for
your graphics cards right yeah but you
don't you don't need the full bandwidth
between the CPU and the graphics card
that you do with it anyway so so no no
no honey you'd you'd at least need for
power supplies I would think for 16
plugs I heard lots of Spencer's right
there here's a question are there any
power supply manufacturers who are
making power supplies tailored for
mining with just like 16 6-pin PCI II
plugs well that is one thing that has
been that is one of the lesser talks
about effects of the cryptocurrency
mining craze is that not only are a lot
of graphics cards becoming to have
become very difficult to obtain like AMD
cards and whatever but it's really
really high wattage power supplies have
suddenly become in vogue which hasn't
really been a thing like most of the
time for a gaming PC you don't need you
know five to seven hundred Watts maybe
eight hundred if we go in SLI eight or
nine you know ish but suddenly people
actually have use a really good
efficiency 1214 1500 watt power supplies
so right yes that is a thing
but yeah I mean all you have with the
with the with a 6 pin PCI connector is
three grounds and three 12-volt leads so
all you're doing is is buying a bunch of
connections off of the 12 volt rail
right so it just matters what you
connect those to and whether you have
multiple 12 volt rails and what the draw
is across all those yeah so yeah you can
effectively plug that in with a bunch of
splitters but I guess I don't know I
don't know what kind of effective
whatever my first plane yeah let's
switch to yes yes yes micro sensor okay
Micro Center taking what I don't know
may or may not be an effective move
against warding miners from buying tons
and tons of graphic graphics cards by
basically playing or having a good time
with their multiple order counts
functionality for how many cards you buy
at the same time so if you've seen sites
like Micro Center before often they'll
have bulk pricing available for
different graphics cards here you can
see the power color rx 580 red devil buy
one there 350 bucks each by to the 350
bucks each by more than ten thousand
dollars each so this is micro centers
way of basically saying hey don't buy a
crap ton of our graphics cards from us
now bear in mind of course this isn't rx
580 and it's 350 bucks and yes that is
overpriced by out of about a hundred
bucks anyway sure so they are you know
dipping into that a little bit but it is
something it is something because look
does he see someone walking out a micro
Center with a shopping cart full of rx5
ATS or whatever you're like what what's
I saw I saw I saw a reddit thread with a
comment on it the other day and the
person said the guy that they the guy
they knew so this is anecdotal but he
would buy a bunch of cards here and then
he basically fly them to China and sell
them in China and make four or five
thousand dollar profit because in China
the crypto mining thing is so insane and
so popular
maybe you can get free free access to
electricity of that I feel most people
these lands especially techies are gonna
look at this as a challenge like oh
you're gonna try to restrict me from
buying more than two video cards I'm
just gonna you know sit have and they
use a different account and send the
third and fourth and fifth graphics card
to a different shipping address maybe a
friend or family member and I'm gonna
get around it so yeah I mean there's
potentially ways to thwart this type of
thing but even if it's just one of those
sort of like for show kind of kind of
things I guess I don't know it's a
marketing thing any time you see
something like that we're like well that
would probably keep people from buying
more than two of those that is thousands
a bit like couldn't you just put a
thousand no one's gonna do a thousand
for an hour expected probably not I
don't know it depends on the price of
etherium at the moment all right let's
move back to No let's move back to know
from yes yeah I know here's the gamers
Nexus article about encouraging GPU
price-gouging
gamers Nexus did an article on this as
well as a video along with it about MD
and about Timothy I originally saw this
this tweet
I saw this too from AMD gaming and this
is where this is all sourced from AMD
gaming probably had some kind of deal or
setup something as far as an advertising
deal Best Buy
yeah to advertise this specific XFX rx
574 sale at Best Buy
so AMD gaming is like a felony to give
me a GP you grab this XFX play hard RX /
I'm 74 best back from only $279 and get
the quake champions pack breathe and a
bunch of people are curling up on this
and we're like are you freaking kidding
me AMD gating gaming do you know how
much a rx 570 is supposed to cost yeah
like really so Steve made a video on
this
and and so just to be clear here this is
the this is no super say no to
definitely do things here I want to say
no double no two things here double no
one no two AMD for talking up the
awesome price of this card which is
clearly very overpriced yeah but a
secondary no a secondary notice Steve
I'm sorry Steve but I'm calling you out
huge price gouging is a term that I feel
is thrown around a little bit too
loosely and as Steve titled the article
as well as the video price gouging I'm
gonna take issue here so what is the
definition of price what does price
gouging actually mean that price gouging
is actually something that you can take
legal action against depending on where
you are on what state you are on that
kind of thing
it's a pejorative term referring to when
a seller spikes the prices of goods
services or commodities to a level much
higher than is considered reasonable or
fair okay and is considered exploitative
okay potentially to an unethical extent
okay yeah now here's the issue price
gouging as a term is normally used for
something that is absolutely necessary
to live if you for example were a victim
of one of the recent hurricanes Harvey
or were recently and shadow tell you all
in Florida stay strong I hope you guys
are doing well and everyone who might
happen to be willing to donate to Harvey
or our maverick Irma people people are
affected by those circuits we strongly
encourage that donations to the Red
Cross of course are great but price
gouging I feel like it's thrown about
around a little bit too often when it
comes to something like a graphics card
that you might be using to play video
games with you don't need to play video
games live let's be honest okay so price
gouging is really only a term reserved
for like essential assets and resources
yes there's you know imprecise legal
usage it is the name of a crime that
applies in some jurisdictions of the
United States during civil emergency see
the dogs are upset too
right now you guys you guys pissing them
up in less precise usage less precise
very very okay unless precisely go in
less precise precise usage and by the
way less precise usage is Wikipedia's
way of saying wrong yes you know
Wikipedia doesn't like to be too much of
an asshole there publicly you know
they're sure they rely on donations
stuff like that as well intelligent it
can refer to either prices obtained by
practices inconsistent with a
competitive free market which you
couldn't Nestle you could apply to AMD's
pricing for their graphics cards or
windfall profits in the former Soviet
Union it's simply included under the
single definition of speculation so okay
all I'm trying to say here is given give
AMD crap for over price in their
products give AMD crap for saying on the
one hand we want to sell our products to
gamers we you're all about gamers and
everything and then on the other hand
going and releasing a driver that's
tailored to improve miners mining
performance or them saying like yeah we
want gamers to that stuff and saying
like hey look at this great deal in this
overpriced graphics card to the dude own
place or whatever like that call them
out on saying one thing and doing
another right price gouging though I do
feel like it's thrown around a little
bit to willy-nilly okay and when it
comes to actual actual price gouging
that's the contrast they make not to be
like well they're beating dicks whatever
but actual price gouging is it's like
keeping people away from the things they
need to live and serve I have another
day like that's what prayer that's what
the term price gouging is all about
right so this is this is where I would
say if you're in a third world country
and bread has now been you know taken
over by Martin shkreli and he's making
it five times the cost it's not supposed
to say his name cut yeah I know I know
so so so is there so here's here's my
question is is there a more appropriate
term or word or phrase to describe what
we're feeling for this sort of situation
besides price of price gouging AMD is
not necessarily
price-gouging but they are blank is
there any alternative I mean like just
overpriced simply yeah it's just over
and over inflated or inflated pricing or
that kind of thing yeah yeah yep baby
yeah I don't know so I don't know Paul
some people might might argue that
gaming graphics cards are necessary for
for a first survival I mean if you live
off of cryptocurrency then they okay
maybe then maybe then you have an
argument for me if you are if you if you
are a Bitcoin but if you are a baby you
are a Bitcoin then then there is then
we'll let it's like a verified
price-gouging
let's end on a high note let's say yes
yes we have a yes here from Windows 10
Microsoft has actually addressed a
stuttering problem with one of the
recent updates so we would say we would
initially say no because of no no
creators updated March but as far back
as March they wouldn't the creators
update was first actually made available
dance caused stuttering in specific
games let's list your overwatch rocket
League Mass Effect very popular games
very widely played and definitely one of
those maddening things like you build
your own computer you get it all set up
your playing and micro stutter healing
what my crystal is causing that yeah
yeah no reason for like it's maddening
it's sporadic you like yeah did I do
something wrong you know is it the
software its price couch do I have do I
have you know is fresh right yeah the
price gouging that's causing the
stuttering but Microsoft has addressed
this directly they have they have said
yes they know it happens and they are
promising and fixed to ongoing game
stuttering problems hopefully with the
next creators update I guess I don't
know
fingers crossed everybody yeah fingers
crossed but for anyone who has been
experiencing this type of thing
hopefully there is a fix on the way and
hopefully
often get that out very soon build 16 to
73 of the insiders program released on
August 23rd contained a few feature
updates including new fonts and mixed
reality control server Microsoft has
moved to the bug fixing portion of its
development process in preparation for
the fall creators update which is going
to be deployed October 20
I'm sorry October 17th so just about a
month from now a little over a month so
hopefully if you're having stuttering
problems maybe that will be the fix that
fixes it beautiful awesome all right we
are now finished with the yes/no segment
yeah we're gonna finish off with a few
shoutouts to those of you who have
purchased stuff on our stores but before
we get to that some some QA for those of
you who maybe have happened to donate it
during my half of the show answer your
questions there's lots of questions hey
where'd that go Oh Paul said oh cool we
do leave you Cal saps that makes it much
easier first question from Tom's Bream
Smith's
with 28 Norwegian kroner okey I will try
to send something hold on for Reaper
rebirth Reaper Reaper I know what that
means
he donated on your half and we said
something and maybe he's responding
Reaper Oh Sal also said Chrome's screwed
up here so maybe we missed something I
don't know Thank You Thomas Thank You
Thomas thank you Alex McNab with ten
British pounds lol lol so 95 90 again
don't need the course just a gamer best
for the 980ti is please all right if
you're absolutely going for just trick
gaming than a 7700 K is probably what
you want to go for mm-hmm
I mean just get the highest ICC straight
up but but coffee lake is on the horizon
and might potentially have better IPC
than than what you can get with that so
out for might be worth - worth its
weight I don't know a month two to three
and we're not sure yeah it's all rumored
stuff right now we can't say for sure so
Alex maybe you should wait for the next
generation of Intel if
Gaming strictly as your as what you're
into because Intel does had still had
the edge day yeah I'm a $9.99 with a $10
donation thank you sir
4790k at 1080 TI issue only played
erasing all cpu cores unpacked same
usage in cam performance power and
Windows and Anthony FPS from 180 to 50
was a lot of stutter on triple monitors
as the I Kyle house here I do it my eye
is fine yes my glasses glasses did
protect him from that they really did
there that they are the true unsung hero
of today's stream but if you're
experiencing really like bad droppage
from 180 to 50 FPS with stutter on
triple monitors it's cuz using triple
monitor did you go from one monitor is
that is that what the drop you're
talking about 180 on one monitor and 50
on three cuz that makes sense it might
be it might might have to do with your
triple monitor usage multiple monitors
like that and resolutions like that
actually
Rustom sometimes sometimes do not have
as great of support on the software side
specifically from iRacing I'm not
familiar with iRacing and their support
for multiple monitor this so I can't say
that absolutely sure I'm familiar with
that game yeah I I would maybe consider
doing some testing just with a single
monitor and see if you have that same
kind of performance tip as far as the
variance from the high frame rate down
to the lowest frame rate and that might
tell you whether or not your issue is
more to do with the multi monitor issue
or whether you actually have something
else going on such as a problem with
your with your CPU or software or
something like that you know that you
might be able to fix otherwise it might
just be multi-monitor support and then
if I'm assuming you're doing like a
really a really wide aspect ratio I'd
resolution and it might just be
something like that combined with
iRacing I would also consider looking up
other people since I know iRacing tends
to be that kind of game that has a
community of followers see if you can
find anyone else who has your same set
up and what kind of performance they're
getting because if if yeah if you can
find someone else is like yeah this is
what I'm using it it's awesome then
you'd be like I
I've got some going on that's specific
to me right then yeah troubleshooting
that can be a pain in the ass Manny
Thank You Manny though missed xtube
$5.00 Canadians re-emits and E 1980 X
and GT x 1080 AMD has a 1950 X I've
guessing is what you're saying it's an
odd pair but the FPS was unexpected so I
think what they're saying is Linus
recently did a video where they tested a
1950 X with the GTX 1080
yes AMD's 1950 X is is based on rise in
architecture and at the same frequencies
you should get roughly the same
performance out of a GTX 280 that you
would with a standard like a rise in
1800 X or something like that so that's
what I would compare it to I haven't
watched that video with Linus
specifically but you know testing is can
be anecdotal um it depends it depends on
the setup and everything it depends on
how thorough they were with saying like
oh here was a test we ran that seemed
out of the ordinary so we did this and
this and this to see if we can figure
out what was causing that or whatever
but again I haven't watch the video so
I'm sorry I can't provide I'm will go to
the bathroom okay really
no problem I'll BRB Joo Picard $5
donation naari now you tell her no
certainly sternly and thoroughly do your
Picard five dollar donation you
mentioned the an for socket will go to
2020 anything about how long tr4 will go
tell if it's 20 28 1958 later drew I
would agree
anyone who I'm saying maybe consider in
1900 X is people who I'm saying consider
a 1900 X if you're planning to upgrade
later if all you ever need is 8 cores
then it makes a lot more sense to go
with the mainstream platform from AMD
and a m4 with like a 370 X setup for
something like that 2020 is I believe I
I would need to correct myself on that I
think I said that off the top of my head
but I'm pretty sure that's what AMD said
that's what they're going to support the
aim for socket for there's no telling if
they might come up with another platform
at the same
time is that or whatever but a lot of
this has to do with their need to
reinsure to reassure for instance like
om this system integrators to be able to
say look or companies that are building
systems for use in like a workplace
environment to say this hardware that
you're investing in right now is going
to have support and updates through a
very significantly longer period of time
or at least a defined period of time for
like four plus four years three or four
years so yeah there's a lot going on
there but that's what we're expecting so
I think if there is this end to next
year from what they told us it should
also be compatible with a m4 but yeah
again we're not sure they might do a new
chipset or something like that as
possible it's just there's lots of
there's lots of variables that go in
there all right what's next five dollars
from it's a $5 donation there's no name
on it but it says hi Paul thank you for
coming to my birthday celebration here's
some cash for the beer
Kyle shared with Kyle you're a dummy but
I still love you so happy birthday to

next up is Robert Davis with a $5
donation Kyle thank you for making me
purchase an 80 20 20 Mike it sounds
amazing amazing also when will the H 500
P be out soon I think they take 500 P I
know I know it's soon relatively soon
that was first I was first introduced at
Computex it doesn't seem like a pretty
exciting case I know I told coolermaster
that I didn't want the cosmos because
it's just too large but I am interested
in the half and here's Danny there's a
500-pound dog yeah jujubee's $20
donation I forgot how much I gave Kyle
hey I'll assume it's 20 bucks sounds
alright that makes it even between the
two of us I can convey that later Chris
thank you jujubes Chris Warren $10
donation I'm building an HTP see out of
an old 3770 can you suggest a case that
doesn't have a side window size doesn't
matter I don't need to hide the PC more
concerned with hiding the ugliness with
in most cases I mean a mini ITX one you
can find okay yeah so my htpc that wife
and sauce and I have used for the last
couple years has been the sg0 5 from
silverstone okay it's just a little
bare-bones box it's just black box it
has ventilation on almost every side of
it so there's no window just steel on
every side so it's good and it's very
portable so it'll fit pretty much
anywhere oh let's just say in a lot of
cases that you can find that have side
panel windows will often have versions
you can buy that have a solid side panel
as well yeah that's very very common so
sorry we don't have very many direct
recommendations for you but um
motherboard size would have been
important thing I'm assuming your full
ATX just yeah just get like a s340 or
something like that but this it's all
inside panel automatic Matt $5 donation

money so we'll just take it out el jéfe
reviews $5 any thoughts on YouTube Auto
flagging videos is unsuitable for ads
happens to me for the first time last
week has this happened to you guys yet
it has not happened to me no no no I
feel I feel the same I feel bad because
I've seen it having to a lot of people
who are doing content that's totally not
like the type you would see Flags
right yeah Taryn from ltte just tweeted
something he was doing he was doing some
a beat
comparison testing well he was just
uploading like 10 second clips to
YouTube yeah they were exactly the same
but one of them had some scrolling text
at the bottom that wasn't even like bad
or anything and it got flagged for
unsuitable for advertising he tweeted
about it today I looked at I was like if
that's true that's really effed up
because it was literally just like some
scrollable text that was moving across
the bottom of the screen same clip is
the other one the other one was
perfectly fine so the algorithm is
clearly not perfect which is really
unfortunate to a lot
well yeah that really sucks I'm good I
like like I feel bad but I kind of feel
like we are like our channels are of a
certain subscribership and a certain age
to where we're in a group that's not
being as flagged as as like cuz
obviously this automation going on
that's doing some flagging and I feel
like we're kind of like we kind of
missed that because cuz we're at a
certain level mm-hmm I feel bad about
that but yeah at this point none of my
none of my system flagged so I feel
really really bad for anyone who has
been doing with that especially people
who who make a living off of this cuz
it's really really difficult to do yeah
but I hope YouTube you know gets their
act together as far as the balance
between right suitable advertising
contents providing ads for people that
are appropriate and being able to pay
creators to make more content because
that's kind of how their business model
is supposed to work
Kevin Guzman $5 donation is starting a
LAN gaming center a viable business in
America orga gamers already have decent
systems consoles and good internet Kevin
I would say no all right maybe depending
on the community that you're a part of
but I will say in my experience in the
u.s. land gaming centers or just
businesses where people go and there's a
bunch of computers and they can go play
games together I see those a lot lot
less frequently than I feel like are
like the internet cafes and stuff like
that that you find in Asia there are a
lot more frequent and a lot more common
I still see them around I know there's
one in Fullerton that I've seen before
they're around but nowhere near where
they used to be yeah so there was
there's been a couple that I used to
frequent when I was younger that are
have closed down and have been replaced
because there's just not as much of a
demand for it yes no one's on 56k
dial-up or I think you need you need to
make sure that you have a regular
clientele that can sustain your business
so in some communities maybe that is
something that you could
put together yeah but it's really
probably gonna be on a case-by-case
basis
so I'd say generally speaking in the US
no but but but don't give up on that
like check check with the community see
if that's something that's desired
crafty AK five dollar donation
playing and after pretty sometime before
your tool then your fingers are still
working correctly all right so the after
parties after the show we kind of like
we enjoyed but we just shut them because
it's like after doing all the drinking
and everything it's like it's really
tiring so there's a lot of energy to do
the show believe I can't promise any
further after parties as far as directly
after the show after parties right but I
do like live streaming and I do want to
get back into that so I've been thinking
about some possibilities for some like
doing something where I live stream to
twitch where I'm streaming like a
specific rig or set up that I'm gaming
on and then you can see the frame rate
and everything like that and then I can
take that twitch stream and then I cut
it down to like some shorter parts and
then float that to youtube or something
would be cool is if like you and I did
sort of a collab thing we can even
include like J or whoever else where we
each gamed or streamed on different pcs
of different tiers like maybe I was mid
range you were high end and J was like
super high end or whatever for example
and we just streamed like pub G together
or something for like a couple hours and
it'd be like the three of us playing a
game together and we'd have like the
framerate counter and stuff like you
said you know maybe MSI Afterburner
rivatuner statistics and stuff up on the
UHD inside I think that'd be kind of
cool yeah we should be she's I
definitely we should organize something
like that I definitely wanna I
definitely want to game more and I feel
like you that fact I was one a game and
I'm like no I can't game I need to do I
need to work on videos or whatever
reason make gaming the work yeah I need
to make more videos that involve me
gaming so alright mines this patek $10
