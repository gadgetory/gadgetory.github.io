brand-new fractal design define our five

hello everyone and welcome to my holiday
gaming builds video this is a video of a
style that I haven't really done before
but it is actually cyber monday 2014
right now as of the filming of this
video and hopefully also as of the
uploading of this video there's a ton of
crazy deals going on right now for
computer parts and components that are
out there so I decided to put together
three excellent gaming builds
specifically for the holidays and
specifically for this time of year now
since it's Cyber Monday and since Black
Friday I just finished there's a lot of
fluctuation going on with pricing so
I've been using PC part picker in order
to put these builds together but the
price is even since last night when I
first started doing this have been going
all over the place so the prices are
really good but they might not be the
same price as you hear me talk about
right now when you click on the links
the links by the way in this video's
description
you can look those to check them out and
with all of these builds you should bear
in mind that you're gonna need first off
some additional components if you want
to actually get these up and running so
these are only the hardware for the
actual desktop computer itself these are
all ATX builds because I think that's a
good starting off point and it provides
a lot of flexibility you're going to
need an operating system first of all so
you could go ahead and download the
windows technical preview for Windows 10
right now it's free you can use it you
will need to pay for it eventually but
you can start using it right now free of
charge
can also go the linux route but that's a
totally different video so I'll leave
that up to you guys but if you're gonna
go the traditional Windows route which
is kind of pretty standard for a gaming
system you're going to need to add
eighty two hundred eighty two hundred
bucks for that software and then you
also might consider monitor keyboard
mouse if you don't have those available
already those are gonna run you i'd say
about 150 bucks for a decent set of all
three of those two so apart from that
the prices of these builds I wasn't
going for a price point I wanted to kind
of go for a bug budget
middle-of-the-road and and more high-end
but there is sort of a dollar amount for
each of these systems so the budget bill
that was going for about four to six
hundred bucks and ended up with about
450
for the build for the mid-tier when I
was going for about 80 to 100 M sorry
800 to a thousand and I did end up
closer to a thousand and then for the
high-end build I was gone for fifteen to
eighteen hundred and I came close to
1,800 on that one but let's go ahead and
start taking a look at these builds
again PC part picker I've used they they
added me as a as a friend on Twitter or
they followed me on Twitter so that was
cool and other than that I have no other
direct affiliation with them but it's a
great site for comparing prices and also
putting builds together and they have
good stuff like compatibility charts and
that sort of thing so here's kind of the
look at all three of these builds and as
you can see prices have dipped towards
the end of these charts here because
it's Black Friday Cyber Monday but
prices are really good and most of these
systems are a lot cheaper now than they
were say a months to two or three months
ago but let's go ahead and kick things
off and start with the budget builds I
usually start with the CPU when I'm
doing a system build for this one I
actually went more towards a chipset I
knew I wanted FM 2 plus I wasn't gonna
go for the FX series right now because I
want this to be a starter option with
with upgrade potential so for that I
wanted the a 88x chipset which is going
to give you the most features available
so for this one I actually started with
the motherboard which is the gigabyte g1
sniper 888 X it's a full ATX motherboard
that I chose for this one currently on
sale for 96 dollars at Newegg you get a
$20 million rebate card that takes it
down to 77 really solid ATX motherboard
all the a 88x features and of course the
CPU will drop right into that and the
CPU have chosen for this one is the a-10
78 50k now one with a 88x chipset
motherboard first off and then I was
gonna look at AP use and choose one that
was reasonably priced and then I saw
that the a-10 78 50k which is basically
the the highest end in this range was
only hundred and thirty bucks right now
so that's an insane deal for both the
APU which gives you a really nice quad
core CPU built in there as well as
really excellent integrated graphics and
that's why I went with AMD for this
build instead of Intel because I GPU
here is actually something that you
could use for awhile with the potential
then to then add a video card in the
future to upgrade the system so hundred
thirty bucks for that
absolutely insane for the memory and
went with g.skill ripjaws e ddr3 2400
kit now this is a higher end memory kit
this is actually a nicer memory kit than
I put in the mid tier build for example
but the reason I want a 2400 speed
memory is because it's an APU I'm
assuming you're gonna be relying on the
integrated graphics for at least a
little while so 2400 speed memory is
really going to boost up the performance
of the integrated graphics now if you're
not using the eye GPU then you could
potentially get cheaper memory in order
to boost up the amount of money you have
to spend on a graphics card but if
you're going with an APU high speed
memory is definitely something to get
and eighty-six bucks for this 8 gig 2400
speed kit there's a really nice deal
right now
so that's your CPU that's your
motherboard and that's your memory those
are kind of the core components only
three other parts in this build and when
I got this all this these parts put
together last night when I was first
looking at it I was like holy crap this
is an insanely good build for the amount
of money that you'd spend on it so for
storage I just went with an SSD SanDisk
Ultra to 240 gig really really solid SSD
from SanDisk I like their offerings this
is 85 bucks for 240 gigs so because I
was able to get to 44 so cheap I did not
add a mechanical hard drive to this so
you limited the 240 gigs of space but
add a hard drive on if you want to for
50 bucks or so you can get a 1 terabyte
hard drive right now or just make that
your first upgrade in the future is
adding on some more storage especially
if you have a large Steam library you'll
fill up this SSD pretty quickly for the
for the case we will at the NZXT source
210 honestly there's not much you can do
to get a better budget case that's full
ATX with the features here this one's 30
bucks right now after a $10 million
rebate on new eggs so insane deal for
the Equality of this case one thing to
bear in mind you don't have USB 3.0 on
the front panel so you're not gonna be
able to plug that in from the
motherboard that was called out on the
PC part picker site so you might
consider a USB 3.0 add-on card or just
go without it for the time being maybe a
front panel Abby and I sat on there and
then for the power supply Corsair CX 500
M
500 watts power supply here really
really saw a power supply and this one's
45 bucks after the mail in rebate cards
so you can't go wrong here and it's a
it's even partially modular which is
pretty cool this is a really really
solid power supply 80 plus bronze rated
45 bucks
another no-brainer so that brings a
total for this entire build to four
hundred and fifty two dollars and ninety
three cents right now so less than five
hundred dollars for this system and then
if you wanted to do some upgrades I
already talked about adding on a some
storage to give yourself some more mass
storage and a mechanical spinning hard
drive but I would also say video card
will be the next big upgrade for this
one right now you can get an r9 290 for
230 to 240 bucks that's crazy you can
get an iron and 280x for $200 you can
get an r9 285 for $170 you can get an r9
270x for a hundred thirty two hundred
and forty dollars at each of those price
points any of those cards would be a
fantastic add-on for this system again
if you're gonna buy the video card right
up front you might consider spending a
little bit less in the memory in order
to spend a little bit more on the
graphics card because the memories are
not gonna do as much good if you're not
using that integrated GPU but there's my
first budget build around 450 to 500
bucks for a nice AMD APU build with
their flagship 70 at 50 K so check that
one out again all links to these builds
are in the description let's move on to
our second build and this one is
actually our middle-of-the-road build so
this one actually I was I was looking
for sub $1000 and right now 982 is a
toll that I'm getting on PC part picker
for all of these parts so let's go ahead
and take a look at them starting off
with the motherboard actually I didn't
start with the motherboard for this one
I actually started with the CPU so 4690k
is really kind of the de facto standard
for a mid to high end gaming build right
now it's just going to give you the best
performance it's got the best
instructions per clock performance for a
CPU and you can get it at Micro Center
for a hundred and eighty bucks if you
can go into a store if you can't go into
store into a store and get this then
you're gonna end up paying more like two
hundred to two hundred and ten dollars
but Micro Center has has fantastic deals
if you can get into if
we'll store location to buy that apart
from that we do need a cooler I went
with the stock or reference the stock
cooler for the AMD build for this one we
updated we upgraded to the hyper 212 Evo
NCIX has it for 30 bucks right now I've
saw I've seen it for as little as $25
with some mail-in rebates and stuff
going on but that was last night
now it's this morning and who knows but
maybe maybe as the week proceeds we'll
see good deals in the hyper 212 evo and
for anyone who's building a system right
now if you're looking at dropping say
eighty a hundred plus bucks on a CPU
cooler consider the hyper 212 Evo the
amount of cooling gains you get for
going with a closed-loop cooler or
something like that it's really pretty
marginal compared to something like this
this is the best bang for your buck for
25 or 30 bucks and the performance you
get I'd much rather spend that extra 50
to 70 dollars on a better graphics card
for example rather than going for like a
sweet 240 millimeter clothes look cooler
all that being said the 212 Evo is going
to do a fantastic job it'll allow you to
overclock and then I paired that with
the Asus z97 a motherboard now this one
is in flux right now we saw 420 bucks at
ncx but it sold out superb is just shady
sounding name for a business company
online website but who knows just be iiz
that's weird to me anyway but they have
it for 129 they have a promo deal going
on but it ends today for 15% off like a
lot of their stuff so catch that if you
still have time today but anyway 122 134
are really nice Asus z97 a motherboard
crazy tons of features here you got full
ATX four dimm slots all the stuff you
would need we paired that with the
Kingston Fury Black Series 8 gig memory
kit again eight gigs here which I think
it's totally fine for right now for
gaming and browsing honestly you can get
by those four gigs right now but I like
I like eight gigs again super busy and
is super B's I don't know how to
pronounce that website but they've got
it for 81 dollars right now but this
pricing on this was that's with I'm
sorry it's you can get it down to 68 69
if you use the 15% off code but you're
probably gonna end up paying more
like in the 7280 dollar range right now
for something like this but I liked it
because it's got some some nice it's
gonna match well it's got heat spreaders
for the storage again I went to San
Dick's SanDisk Ultra to deal 85 bucks at
Amazon hi there I couldn't find any
better deal on a SSD right now that's
actually in stock the 840 Evo will come
back to the 840 Evo we did add some
extra storage for this so I just grabbed
a Seagate Barracuda 1 terabyte hard
drive 54 dollars for an extra 1
terabytes of space if that's not enough
for you considering if spending more
towards $100 ish and you can get a 3 2
or 3 terabyte drive again tons of deals
going on right now let's keep the price
down and went with 1 terabyte video card
choice was difficult here I wanted to go
with the GTX 970 because I feel like
that's really one of the best bang for
your buck graphics cards right now in
the 300 to $350 range
tons of pricing options on these like.we
again super business had this sorry to
keep pronouncing about that but they had
this for 315 after their special that's
going on but limit one per customer and
it's out of stock a lot of the nine 70s
especially the cheaper ones are just out
of stock right now so whereas you could
get one for 315 to 330 chances are
you're gonna need to pay more like 330
to 350 in which case in this option I
would consider also the asus strix gtx
970
fantastic see how that's around $350
that would match nicely with the asus
motherboard but for this one I want the
zotac just because it was on such a good
deal right now and I thought it was
pretty cool that this kind of gray
shroud is pretty pretty mellow and I
feel like it would match with the rest
of the hardware here pretty well moving
right along for a case for this build we
got a thermal take commander g42 this
one has a window it's a mid tower
chassis I chose this I haven't used this
case personally
but it's got really solid reviews so far
for a more budget oriented case it's
only about 55 bucks and it's got like
all of the features that you would need
right out of the gates granted it's a
$55 case so it's not gonna have quite
all the builds quality and bling and
everything that you would see on a
$8,200 case for example but I think for
this bill that would do
fine and of course you always have the
option of spending more in the case if
you want to we've also got a thermal
take 750-watt 80 plus gold certified
semi modular ATX power supply this is
750 watts which means it is overkill for
this build you can get by with 500 for
this build honestly but I would like to
go for 6 to 700 IO is 750 because this
thing right now that Newegg is an insane
but how much does this cost this is $60
basically no it's $70 no it's $60 so
it's $90 it's a $20 rebate card and then
you can also add on use the promo code
EMC wwh five the MC WWH w52 it ends
tomorrow in a second but another $20
million rebate that brings the total
price of that 757 everybody what 80 plus
gold for 60 bucks that is crazy good and
it's Thermaltake so it'll match with the
case and that pretty much wraps it up
for build number two again total cost
for this build
nine hundred and eighty two dollars
right now that's after the promo
discounts and the mail-in rebates
looking at the chart we was paid at
least 11 200 ish if we go back a few
months on this so it's a really
fantastic deal for really really saw
this is gonna last you a while GTX 970
in there and then if you wanted upgrade
paths in the future adding another GTX
970 would be a great option adding more
memory is also possible upgrading your
storage array is also a possibility so
tons of directions you can go with this
build as well that was like hemming that
upgrade path alright let's move on to
the high end build excited about this
one because it represents a very
powerful build and insane deal on the
graphics card and something that I think
anyone would be really happy with now
here's another example of price
fluctuation I actually had this one at
about 1750 $1,750 last night but it's
actually up it's more like 1800 just a
little over 1800 right now again you can
probably play around with some of the
parts you to look for some other deals
that are going on for this cyber monday
or the week of cyber monday because a
lot of the online businesses seem to be
extending that so they can get as much
sales and everything as they can let's
start off with
the core of this one which was the i7
4790k pretty much the best CPU that you
can get for gaming right now outside of
the enthusiast level processors from
Intel but you need ddr4 for those and
really it's not that big of a boost for
gaming performance anyway so 4790k and
you can get that right now well you can
get it for 250 bucks at micro Center
again if you happen to be close enough
to one but NCIX Amazon Newegg Tiger they
all have these for 300 bucks right now
and and its really good processor anyway
I spend a little bit more on the CPU
cooler for this one simply because I do
like closed-loop coolers I don't want to
say don't get one of those it's just a
little bit more of a premium item I
didn't go again with $100 plus 240
millimeter or 280 millimeter one simply
because I don't think the performance
gains are in line with the amount of
money you pay for it and since we're
trying to keep things within somewhat of
a budget here of course our Hydra of
series 855 I think is a great choice for
this any closed loop cooler that's 120
or 140 millimeter meter 120 or 140
millimeters in this range like 60 bucks
or so is gonna do a great job just make
sure it comes with a fan otherwise
you're gonna need to pay more money to
add that on and go for it because it
keeps the build a lot cleaner and they
run nice and quiet - moving along to a
motherboard we have the MSI z97 gaming 5
this is a LGA 1150 it will be compatible
with the 4790k
really solid board from MSI I think it
looks pretty sweet we've got a windowed
side panel on the case for this build so
I wanted to keep things somewhat
color-coordinated and I like the job
that I mess I did on this board it's
also got some audio improvements there
audio boost experience to get you
started for gaming if you don't
immediately want to go with an external
backer and add a sound card or something
like that
for memory upgraded to 16 gigs for this
one a 2 by 8 gig kit so you're getting
it to your dual channel but you're still
leaving 2 of your DIMM slots open in
case you want to add on more memory of
course this kits available at Newegg for
165 right now it's a 21 33 kits when I'm
looking at memory for a gaming builds
are usually 1618 6
six I'm totally fine with I only picked
this 2133 kit because it was on sale for
a pretty good price go with something
1866 because this kits already sold out
I will try to update my PC part picker
lists to reflect that as much as I can
but with everything going on this week
that's gonna be difficult to do for
storage we went with a 500 gig Samsung
840 Evo now I really like the 840 Evo
some stuff has come up more recently
because it has had some issues with the
TLC memory but just make sure whatever
evil you have you update to the latest
firmware still just fine and $190 for a
500 gig one of these is absolutely
insane
in fact the storage deals that were
going on for Black Friday were
absolutely insane we had one terabyte
SSDs for like 350 bucks $200 for a 500
Drive like this is absolutely fantastic
just again make sure to upgrade the
firmware I did want some mass storage
for this one as well oh yeah there's the
840 Evo which is out of stock you can't
it sold out at Newegg ok moving along
though Western Digital Black Series got
a 2 terabyte drive I went to put the
Black Series for this one because I used
the Black Series drives and they are
noticeably faster than green series
drives so if you're storing games on a
mass storage drive like a mechanical
Drive I find the black drives do offer
some value there and I heard in 20 bucks
for the two terabyte version of this
great deal what more can you want
if you do want more storage versus speed
for about a hundred and twenty or
hundred and thirty bucks I've also seen
for tiger by WD greens out there will it
also be a great option the video card is
maybe a controversial choice here but
this was a hundred percent bang for your
buck decision by me I went with the r9
295x2 from AMD so this is a dual GPU on
a single graphics card graphics card and
if you guys aren't familiar with this
particular one it's pretty much an
absolute beast the reference design from
AMD does a really great job it uses a
lot of power and it outputs a lot of
heat so that's the trade-off there but
six hundred and fifty dollars for the r9
295x2 this debuted at 15
I did need to change my power supply
choice for this bill in order to
accommodate this graphics card because
it does require a lot of power and
there's some specific requirements for
that but more on that in just a moment
let's move on to the case fan sex and do
pro this is a case that I have not
worked with personally but if anyone
from fantex is watching get in touch
with me I'd love to take a look this is
based purely on the recommendation from
Dimitri from Hardware connects so if you
buy this case and you don't like it then
talk to him but $90 for a really really
full-featured case with with many many
check out the new trees of yuan Harbor
connects it's it's a great job a $90 for
that after a rebate so really solid case
side panel window full size it's gonna
fit everything here's the power supply
this one was one where I found a
fantastic deal which is why I chose this
particular power supply this is $90
after $40 male and rebate the
coolermaster silent Pro M to 1000 watts
you're gonna need 850 watts for the r9
295x2 at minimum I wanted to go a little
bit beyond that this one has a really
really solid single rail design you want
a single 12 volt rail with more than
like 52 amps in order to provide power
to the r9 295x2 this one fits the bill
it's 80 plus silver and it's $80 after
the mail and Rheem I'm sorry $90 after
the mail-in rebate so really really saw
a deal there as well holy crap so there
you have it guys
