you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master
so guys AMD just finished their keynote
Lisa su was up on stage she shared a ton
of information and I'm gonna go through
it backwards because they saved the best
for last
so Rison 3 yes it exists and it's coming
and we know now that all of those rumors
and stuff over the past months were
really kind of bunk none of them have
been proven none of them had been
confirmed all we really know about
rising 3 which is based on Zen 2 which
is based on 7 nanometer manufacturing
process is that it's coming in the
middle of 2019 which leaves a pretty
wide range of dates that it could happen
my guess would be at Computex in June
but Lisa held up a rise in 3 CPU and it
was interesting because there were two
dies on there and one of them was small
and one of them was big the small one is
actually these n2 Chiclets which has
eight cores and 16 threads and a super
tiny and they're gonna use that to build
other processors is that multiple ones
like thread refers three presumably but
their other chip on there is actually
the i/o chip to help the rise in three
CPU communicate with the rest of the
system and it's going to support PCI
Express Gen 4 and it should be the first
consumer desktop processor to do that
also these chips are still going to be
based on the am 4 sockets so no note on
if there's a new chipset in Vault but
there is gonna be some backwards and
forwards compatibility with the current
gen rising stuff and the next gen rising
stuff now I want to speculate too much
but if you look at that chip 'let you'll
notice it's kind of asymmetrical and
there's a bit of blank space there so
I'm kind of speculating see where that
chip litt is you could probably fit
another one right next to it which
Catalan some credence to the idea that
there might be 16 core 32 thread CPUs on
this next gen rising platform now just
before all that juicy info they had some
demos and the first demo they had of Xen
2 CPU performance was actually epic
which is the server platform side but
whatever next gen epic turns out to be
it will still use the same socket and it
is also due in the middle of 2019 not to
put too fine a point on it the demo they
showed was of an early epoch next-gen
processor one of them versus two of
Intel's highest end server processors
the xeon 81 80s so two of them versus
one epoch these are AMD demos of course
so grain of salts but they were doing a
complex simulation of the atomic
movement and combination of an HDL
protein and the epic processor was 15
percent faster than two xeon eighty 180s
now for Rison demos they first did a
gaming demo they were showing Forza 4
although the FPS is very very tiny and
hard to see in the top right corner
sorry all of my footage here is from the
720p AMD stream AMD with all their
technology could only muster a 720p
stream for their YouTube livestream but
that aside 110 to 120 frames per second
with Forza 4 and that was at 1080p where
Rison processors tend to suffer a little
bit more because they become more CPU
bound compared to Intel CPUs the other
demo they showed was third gen Rison
which is on the right here versus a 9900
k running its stock which is on the left
a third gen Rison cpu has eight cores
and sixteen threads it is an early
sample running at early clock speeds so
not confirmed yet and they said they'll
probably run faster but the Cinebench
score was 2057 for the horizon 3 and
2040 for the 9900 k so the Rison 3 beat
it and they were showing system power
draw at the same time doing about 135
watts of total system power draw for the
rising based system versus 180 watts for
the Intel based system that's somewhat
compelling now before that they had
their first big announcements of the
events at least in my eyes which was
Radeon 7 for this Radeon 7 because it's
based on 7 nanometer manufacturing
process now bear in mind this is not
Navi Navi is a separate entirely new GPU
architecture this is Vega 2 which is a
follow up to Vega
but shrunk down to the 7 nanometer
process they started off as sort of an
epic sizzle reel about the Radeon 7g PU
and then they actually showed it so the
GPU itself this is presumably the
reference design model has 3 cooling
fans so that then tends to indicate that
they're trying to do their best to keep
it cool but this will feature a 2nd gen
Vega GPU with 60 compute units running
at 1.8 gigahertz and 16 gigabytes of HBM
memory presumably HP m2 with a total of
one terabyte per second of memory
bandwidth 16 gigabytes is a lot more
than the 11 you get with the 2080 TI for
example and a lot more than you get with
the 2080
which has eight gigs here again are some
AMD performance comparisons this is
looking at the Vega 2 versus the
original Vega 64 they're showing 25%
more overall performance using the same
power draw bear in mind vega 64 was
pretty power-hungry so you might not be
seeing huge gains from the die shrink
when it comes to efficiency but maybe
they're just making up for that by
running it at a much higher clock speed
content creation though 27 to 29 percent
performance in their demonstrations
again that's with Premiere
and stuff like DaVinci Resolve and then
for gaming again vs. Vegas 64 35% more
performance with DirectX 12 25% more
performance with DirectX 11 and 42% more
performance with Vulcan again they had a
gaming demo going on this is with Devil
May Cry 5 running at 4k and they were
getting 90 to 100 frames per second also
this is kind of hard to see cuz it's up
in the top corner there it did dip down
into the 70s and 80s at times but
overall look like very solid performance
especially at 4k and then they also ran
a demo of Ubisoft the division 2 which
is launching on March 15th and that one
looked fun but they didn't show any
framerate so performance wise there
wasn't a whole lot to speak of there the
division 2 will be bundled with upcoming
Radeon 7 GP use though as well as some
rise in 5 and risin 7 CPUs and then here
again we had some AMD charts showing the
Radeon 7 versus the RT X 2080 showing
about 62 frames per second in
battlefield 5 and far cry 5 vs. about 61
fps with the 2080 so a little bit faster
but right about the same and then with
strained brigade which always runs
better on radiant cards by the way there
was a much bigger jump 87 FPS versus
these 73 fps with the RT X 2080 of
course we're going to need some
independent reviews to verify all this
but looking pretty promising when it
comes to the performance especially with
the price that was announced it's gonna
launch on February 7th it's like a month
away which is very soon and the price is
six hundred and ninety nine dollars
which is pretty competitive with the RT
X 2080 granite is more expensive
graphics card but we're looking for more
competition with Nvidia at the high end
and I'd be curious in specific
situations like 4k how this will compare
to a 20 80 and even a 20 80 TI which is
a ridiculous $1200 base price final note
here is that the Radeon 7 is going to be
launching with a pretty nice game bundle
you'll get Resident Evil 2 Devil May Cry
5 and at the division 2 if you buy this
for $700 come February 7th of course
before all that they started with the
early stuff that they begin the show
with that's less interesting like
they're gonna do desktop Radeon drivers
on rise in mobile ApS which is probably
good news for those of you who are
gaming on notebooks they're gonna have
AMD based Chromebooks more selection
more choice there and then Phil Spencer
who's the head of gaming at Microsoft
came out and basically said that gaming
is good and fun and there are lots of
gamers and AMD helps with that that's
that's what I boiled that down to but
guys that's gonna wrap it up for this
video I hope you've enjoyed this short
recap of AMD's keynote announcement here
at CES 2019 the big
announcements again Radeon 7gp you
that's probably the biggest one and then
some more confirmation if not the
details we were looking for but at least
more confirmation on the rise and three
stuff based on Zen - 7 nanometer which
is coming out in the middle of 2019 one
final thank you to my sponsors for this
event coolermaster corsair enter max and
deep cool thank you guys so much for
watching hit the thumbs up button on
your way out and there's a playlist with
all my CES 2019 coverage so check that
out too
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
