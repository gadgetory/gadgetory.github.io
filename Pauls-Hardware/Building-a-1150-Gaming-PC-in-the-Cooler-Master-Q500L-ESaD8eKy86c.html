welcome to my monthly build for April
2019 the system I have today I'm pretty
happy with actually because I was trying
to find a balance I've done quite a few
systems that are less than a thousand
dollars recently and if you'd like to
look at a system that's maybe 800 or 900
bucks look at my monthly builds videos
from last month in the month before this
computer is meant to be a gaming PC of
course but it can do much more than that
it's micro ATX so I'm keeping things in
a pretty compact form factor and it only
costs about 1150 dollars so here's our
lovely array of parts and as you can see
we've got some Coolermaster stuff for
the case and power supply we've got an
MSI r-tx 2070 armored gaming graphics
card and that in my opinion is like if
you're gonna spend a decent amount of
money on a graphics card around 500
bucks or so the r-tx 2070 is really the
way to go it's a really good performer
these can range up to $600 but I think
the $500 ones are just fine and the msi
armor qualifies as one of those we have
of course the horizon 7 2700 this one
has been on sale for as cheap as 220
dollars I got this for 225 just recently
the 2700 comes with a race fire cooler
so you get a perfectly adequate and
actually a decent performing for a stock
cooler along with it so you don't need
to worry about spending more money on
that of course you can't upgrade out in
the future it's going to overclock
automatically to 4.1 gigahertz on a
couple cores and of course you can add a
better cooler if you wanted to and
overclock it in the future because we're
unlocked for overclocking with our b4
50m steel legend motherboard from asrock
I really like the B 450 chipset from AMD
because you can still overclock with it
and as long as you get a board that has
decent power delivery and this board
does have decent power delivery then
you're totally just fine even if you're
getting like a pretty powerful CPU with
eight cores and 16 threads like the 2700
this one only cost you about 95 to 105
dollars and it's micro ATX that's part
of my goal for this whole build was to
keep things more compact before I get to
that though we have just a single SSD
for storage in this system and that's
the Intel 660 P which is actually an
MDOT 2 nvme SSD this is the 2 terabyte
version but I actually put the 1
terabyte version in the parts list the 2
terabyte version is a great deal of
about 210 220 dollars for that
about 110 dollars for the one terabyte
version and I wouldn't always say hey
make sure you get a faster nvme SSD for
a gaming PC
over a standard SATA SSD but in this
case the Intel 660 P has actually been
the same price per gigabytes or even a
little bit less than like your one
terabyte SATA SSDs like this SanDisk one
the Intel 660 P uses qlc or four bits
per cell NAND flash memory so it's not
going to be very good for extended
writes I would not recommend this drive
for like a working drive for video
editing or anything but if you're gonna
spend about the same amount of money on
this or this well then yes go ahead and
get a nvme SSD 660 P is a good choice
for that for a memory kid I grabbed the
g.skill flare x2 by a gig kit 16 gigs so
this is a 3200 speed cast latency 14
this is a really good kid of memory it's
flare X which means it's actually made
for rise incompatible with risin so
you're guaranteed to get Samsung B dies
these are a bit more expensive though so
down in the video description I have
actually listed different memories that
will still work with Rison but if you
want to make absolutely a hundred
percent sure that your memory is going
to work with Rison at the speeds that
are listed and consider the flare x kit
just look for a good deal on them if not
go with the kit that I have listed in
the video description rounding things
out we have our case we have our power
supply and we have an added fan now the
case I've listed in the description as
the master box Q 300 L which is $40 this
is the Q 500 L which is $60 but the 500l
and the 300 L are both the same exact
external size so when I contact a cooler
master and said hey guys this just
showed up in the mail but I was actually
looking for aq 300 they were like oh
that's the same size do you want to just
use that and I was like okay so I'm
gonna be building in this but bear in
mind you can get the Q 300 which is
about the same size just doesn't have
the compatibility with full-size ATX
motherboards like this case does I'm
also not a hundred percent sure what the
Q 500 L ships with as far as fans I had
added a master fan pro 140 to the
original build two because TQ 300 L only
ships with one and you want to make sure
you have one for intake and one for
exhaust at minimum finally our power
supply is a new series of power supplies
from coolermaster the MW e 650 gold this
is 80 plus gold rated five-year warranty
black cables cooler master has finally
come out with a new series of power
supplies these are also really well
priced so keep an eye out for these if
you're looking at like EVGA and Corsair
options because these are very good as
well so those are the parts I'm working
with today guys I have my trusty
screwdriver so let's get started
all right so I've just sort of taken
this case apart and given it a first
look and my first impression is that I
should have gone with the Q 300 l for
this build because this is a full-size
ATX case that's part of cooler masters
revisions on this as they managed to
wedge a full-size ATX system and a
pretty compact form factor so good on
them for doing that but I totally should
have just gone with a full sized ATX
motherboard for this build but again
that's not my fault because I was
originally planning on building the Q
300 L reader press forward and talk
about the case itself now here's the i/o
you've got a couple USB 3.0 and your mic
and headphone jacks as well as a power
button that can actually be repositioned
so it's mounted to the case side right
there you can take it and put it up on
the top right there or you can put it on
the bottom right there or you can put it
on the left side right there
Kulik side panel just kind of text them
like that stays in place and then that's
held on by some thumb screws which I
will reapply in just a moment I was at
side panels held on by these kind of
rubber thumb screws and I believe that's
meant to actually be sort of a foot as
well if it's mounted there so you can
set the system on its side once those
are removed it just sort of opens kind
of a little tab right there it'll sort
of prop itself up but that easily falls
off as I demonstrated just a moment ago
and then behind there we can see there's
actually a good amount of cable
management room back here so that is
good this is also where your expansion
drives would go we've got a couple metal
trays here just fell on my thumb screws
and those could handle a single 3.5 inch
drive each or two 2.5 inch drives each
so for SSDs or 2.5 inch drives or 2 3.5
inch drives can fit right there for
accessories we've got a manual here
thumb screws for either side panel and
then they've given us a baggy of screws
and zip ties for mounting anything else
up that might need to be mounted and
then you may have noticed sort of a
distinct pattern on the dust filters for
this case there just tell them by
magnets so they're really easy to peel
off and remove so you know if you got to
clean the dust out of them just pull it
off clean the dust up put it back on and
you get one of those on the top as well
as on the front and then coolermaster
has also included
paul's Hardware versions of those
because of course they design these
cases
to go out to system integrators and that
kind of thing so just sort of pointing
out I don't know if they're going to
sell these blank ones that you can sort
of screen your own printing on to or if
they're going to do a custom shot for
those but you can you know make it your
own by adding a bit of your own personal
Flair like a Paul's hardware logo so
this is our eighth spire cooler which is
notably better than the Wraith stealth
cooler that ships with some of the lower
end risin processors but we were
unboxing stuff and Joe popped us cable
up and I was like what's that cable for
it looks like it's for the rates max
which is the higher end stock cooler
that ships with like an 1800 X but this
actually as our DB you can sort of see
there's a ring around it right there
it's got a little plug there at the back
to plug in this little cable for so
that's kind of cool just sort of a bonus
I suppose what I'm going to do though is
I'm going to rotate this 90 degrees so
that the AMD logo is facing up because
I've actually had people complain about
that in several different videos there's
a couple different ways to do this but
mainly there's four screws that connect
it to the heatsink itself I'm going to
try to get at those so I can just rotate
the whole thing together because there
is a cable that comes out here that's
kind of connected up so there's a top
piece that's a shroud here then there's
a lower piece that's actually the fan
hub I'm gonna try to take that all out
together
okay never mind plan a we're going with
Plan B which is to pop the shroud off
first because it's kind of blocking some
of these screws just a flathead or a
slot screwdriver on the outside to kind
of pry it up and get it off with a
little prongs that's holding it down if
anyone trying to do this at home be
careful because there is an inner ring
here that has some tabs on it that snaps
into this piece which you need to reach
in there to pull off you might notice
the AMD logo kind of getting a little
recessed in there just all three of
these pieces just only sit together when
they're actually attached to the base
piece but once those are loosened and up
off to the side you can give it these
lower screws screw those so the whole
top piece comes off and then look you
can see the beating heart copper slug at
the middle of this whole thing and then
the bottom of the fan too
guys I don't know how if this has been
done much with this RGB version of this
cooler but if I had known it was gonna
be this complicated I probably would not
have bothered with this since it's an
aesthetic fix I think I've got it okay
without breaking anything but you might
notice there's an inner ring here is the
LED and then there's the outer hub and
it's really really tight to get all that
back in there together and then this
inner ring has little tabs that need to
push down into little gaps right there
and it feels like there's no room for it
I've got I think three of them attached
now though and I'm gonna try to push
this last one in famous last words
I did it it's back together
the only sacrifices were this plastic
tab piece that I broke off and and the
pre-applied thermal paste on the bottom
which I messed up my recommendation
though guys for anyone who wants to try
this just just don't just just do it
sideways
alright guys the build is put together
this one had its share of hiccups along
the way unfortunately the Q 500 L is a
decent case I would say for 60 bucks but
it's not really impressing me I just
feel like there's other options out
there for $60 that are more reasonable
that might have tempered glass or some
additional features build quality wasn't
really all there for me either
I feel like for 40 bucks the Q 300 L
makes a little bit more sense so that's
where I would direct you especially if
you're putting this actual system
together when I'm left with now despite
the sort of configuration that they went
with here I have a big blank spot at the
bottom of the system that's just not
being used for anything power supply I
could have gone there then I wouldn't
have had worried about the sort of janky
mounting at the power supply to the
front up here screws were not lining up
there very well at all which made it
very difficult to mount it up there and
once I got it mounted and I was trying
to plug in the modular cables which were
sticking a little bit it just felt like
I was gonna bend the case or something
when I was doing that so ended up
reading it to plug in the modular cables
so if you do build in this case that
recommends plugging your modular cables
first before you install the power
supply into the case that would solve
that problem and then of course there
was that AMD CPU cooler attempt that I
made to rotate it it did work it did
come out vertical so that's nice
I guess but man that was more
challenging that was expected to I have
more to say about this build I'm gonna
follow up and do some testing on it for
now that is all for this video thank you
guys so much for watching we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
