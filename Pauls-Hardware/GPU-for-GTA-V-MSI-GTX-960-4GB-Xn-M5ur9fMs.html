old-school with a video card review
today so here is the brand new msi
geforce gtx 960 gaming 4 gigabyte
edition featuring in videos GM 206
maxwell base GPU and currently retailing
for about 240 dollars that was a bit
critical of the gtx 960 when it launched
with only a 2 gig frame buffer although
i did appreciate things like the power
efficiency and I had no problem
recommending it for PC gaming at 1080p
so will the 4 gigs on this factory
overclocked card from MSI make a
difference especially while playing GTA
5 for PC which is now available it is
also a huge vram hog well to answer that
question I'm going to split this video
in half now I'm not making it a
two-parter but the first half is going
to focus on the card itself from the
specs and overview and whatnot and the
second half will be some live
benchmarking with GTA 5 so feel free to
skip ahead if that's exactly what you're
here for
let's start with a closer look at msi
geforce gtx 960 gaming 4g though my
immediate thought was that this does not
look like a sub $250 card you'll often
see pared-down variations of the custom
cooling solutions on these less
expensive cards this one could easily
pass for a gtx 970 or 980 for that
matter the twin frozer 5 cooler is
almost the same with 3 nickel-plated
heat pipes one 8 millimeter and 2 6
millimeter as well as dual 100
millimeter fans
these are Torx fans with 14 blades of
varying shape and size they're both very
effective and very quiet and I'm going
to feel this piece of plastic out for
the clip just like that now they don't
spin up that's what that piece of
plastic was on here for unless 3d
rendering kicks in and it gets up to a
certain temperature that's a trick
that's very common on these 900 series
cards it's still very nice to have the
red and black aesthetic also works great
overall there's a white LED backlit msi
dragon logo which looks pretty sweet and
what the freaking hell of act plates
like oh my gosh nice black finish back
plate with MSI's dragon logo on it very
very clean something that you don't even
get with MSI standard gaming Edition 970
and nine eighty so sweet cool very good
job inside for including a backplate on
this one the PCB is also a nice black
finish and you
even get these black metal pieces to
kind of fit over the MOSFETs and the
vram modules that helps cool them down
and it also gives the PCB a little bit
of extra support and rigidity for the
card overall the only way I was able to
actually tell at a glance that this is a
GTX 960 apart from the slightly
redesigned cooler is at the end towards
the peg connector the PCB in here is
pretty much empty which isn't a bad
thing but it doesn't mean that this is a
full-sized two slot card
it measures 267 millimeters long or
about 10.5 inches which isn't exactly
short it should be fine in most cases
and the extra size should improve the
cooling performance as well moving on to
connectors you will need an eight pin
peg PCI Express graphics power connector
versus a six pin that you would need on
the reference board MSI is also
recommending a 400 watt power supply for
the graphics card and your entire system
kudos to MSI by the way for flipping
that peg connector so that the catch is
on the top to by the way great job there
is a PCI Express gen3 connector along
the bottom of the card as well as a
single SLI finger along the top of the
card since this card does support
two-way SLI video outs are all the same
as the og gtx 960 970 or 980 in that you
get a dual link DVI in hdmi 2.0 as well
as three DisplayPort 1.2 full-sized
connectors and again you can power for
displays from this single card and video
feature support is also pretty much the
same as the 970 and the 980 so you can
try out their new dynamic super
resolution as well as g-sync shield
support GPU boost physics cuda etc etc
as for course effects the GM 206 GPU
from Nvidia at the heart of this
graphics card supports 1,024 cuda cores
and msi factory overclocked sit to run
at 1240 one megahertz base clock 1304
megahertz boost clock that's compared to
the reference 960 boost which is 1178
rounding out the specs you get 32 ROP
units and of course the 4 gigabytes of
gddr5 memory running at 7,000 10
megahertz on a 128-bit bus now before we
move on to the second half of this video
with some GTA 5 benchmarking and
gameplay demos let's pause for a moment
to recognize my new sponsor that's right
lynda.com
I could tell you guys that lynda.com is

lynda.com/tekzilla dot-com slash Paul
link that one's new why because you've
probably already seen a video online
tech tips or awesomesauce network or any
of the other channels on YouTube that
lynda.com supports explaining what they
are and what they do so whereas I will
be using lynda.com to sharpen my skills
over the next few weeks in areas like
video editing business and photography
for now you can say thank you to
lynda.com for supporting YouTube
creators like me by clicking the link in
this video's description or visiting

so onto some benchmarks I'm going to do
this part pretty much live and I also
wanted to say a quick thank you to my
hardware sponsors for the benchmarking
system that I'll be using today Intel
for the 59 30 K CPU EVGA for the x99
classified motherboard and g.skill for
the Ripjaws for 16 gig ddr4 memory kit
I'll be taking a look at overall
performance as well as comparing the
experience on a two gig gtx 960 versus
the msi gtx 960 gaming 4 gig Edition I
chose GTA 5 because it's the new hotness
of course but also because the wide open
world environment is a natural vram hog
increasing settings like draw distance
and traffic density will require the
game engine to load more textures into
the memory buffer and if it goes beyond
to a gigabytes we should see the
standard 960s performance tank but I
wanted to take a look at some results
here so first off and this is the MSI
card here's some gpu-z results and I do
want to point out that the GPU core
clock actually gets up to 1404 right at
the box I haven't done any overclocking
with this and then these are my maximum
results after I've gone through all
three passes so you'll note in the
memory used column right there
goodness 3.4 gigs of memory being used
and this is just a 1080 and GPU
temperature only got up to 63 so that
was one thing actually it was having a
hard time getting these fans to spin up
at first because the GPU wouldn't get
warm enough but that's nice it's
definitely very very
to cooler with the Twin Frozr five right
there I wanted to do some live testing
with GTA 5 online so that's what I'm
doing right now
this is fraps up in the corner to show
the framerate and I'm just going to play
the game it's most fun I've had all day
slowing down some pedestrians primary
it's still holding pretty well 84 times
the police officer
okay I'm gonna change things up midway
through and go to settings graphics and
we're going to turn up 2x2 MSA and
alright so yeah MSA a man that's kind of
a nasty hit it goes from it goes from
like 70 to 80 down to 60 which is not
all that great I'd much rather be at 70
to 80 with everything set to maximum in
the regular graphics menu but I didn't
turn on any of the fancy stuff and the
other graphics menu what I found out was
first that you can die very easily
online people will kill you
the other thing is that I found out was
basically that at 0 X msaa I was golden
I was pretty much 70 to 80 FPS the whole
time however when I put on the by 2 MSA
my framerate dipped down to 50 to 60 ish
which is not as good so my conclusion
here is that the 960 with four gigs
particularly this msi version which is
very dark right now is great for grand
theft auto 5 if you're on a bit of a
budget however I would recommend keeping
that MSAA setting turns to 0 X or
messing with some other stuff if you
want to keep well above 60 fps so now
that you've looked at some numbers and
some gameplay is the gtx 960 4 gig a
good card for GTA 5 well i would say yes
GTA 5 is actually a great port which it
damn well better be after rockstar made
us wait for so long and even budget
cards can perform pretty well as long as
you're willing to reduce few settings
here and there you might not be able to
turn all the eye candy all the way up
with a gtx 960 but the added memory
means you won't hit a wall at 2 gigs of
usage and in my opinion draw distance
was one of the more important things
that i always liked to max out in a game
like GTA 5 msi gtx 960 gaming 4 gigabyte
edition is a great take on this card -
and I really like that MSI managed to
mane
premium feel of their flagship cards in
this much more budget-friendly version
