hardware today's video is going to be
covering a few things I'm going to be
building a system with all the hardware
you see here in front of you also I have
the define s2 a brand new case from
fractal to follow up to the original
define s so I'm going to be covering
that's and I'm going to be building with
the new ZOTAC r-tx 2080 so we'll get a
first look at that to the enter max
liquid tech tr4 - all in one liquid CPU
cooler has a massive contact plate made
just for thread Ripper and is rated for
500 watts of heat dissipation high
pressure pwm fans mount two rubber
channels on the radiator to absorb
vibration and the sexy logo and edge
lighting on the block is addressable for
syncing with your motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more so the original
define s was a very popular case if you
guys watched Cal's channel bit wit he
built his custom water-cooled PC hotline
in that I've had a bit of a rivalry
between hot line and my custom articled
pc arctic panther which is built in a
fractal define art v which i've modified
so i'm gonna be kind of comparing the s2
to my modified define r5 of course we
have the r6 as well i've looked over the
reviewers guide for this case and I will
say my first impression is that it has
all the features that you'd really want
right now we just have to determine if
it's gonna be worth the hundred and
fifty dollar current MSRP that it is
launching it I'll be on the case we have
our graphics card which is the Zoet X RT
x 2080 this is the OC gaming version of
that so it has a custom cooler from
ZOTAC and the overall cost of the system
I should say is about two thousand
dollars if you're comparing that to my
fastest build you can possibly build
right now system which was around $2,400
yes you could swap out some parts here
and there for example in that building I
was recommending a 20 atti versus a 20
80 this one's a little bit more rounded
and I'm also using an AMD platform here
with the x4 70 chipset and if you wanna
get more cores and threads on your CPU
like the 2700 X we have here which is an
8 core 16 thread processor then AMD can
get you that for a little bit less money
than you currently have to pay on the
intel side of course on the intel side
we have new launches coming out probably
later this month so we'll further this
discussion but let's not get too
distracted from that the motherboard
we're using is the MSI x4 70 gaming m7
ac and this one's going to cost a little
over $200 you can get by with a cheaper
motherboard 150 to 170 dollar range one
of the key things I wanted to make sure
the
the board had other than the X 470
chipsets and four sockets is also the
ability to plug in the front panel USB
3.1 gen2 adapter which this new case has
which is a thing that I've been liking
in cases so I want to make sure I'm able
to plug that in for memory I recommend
higher speed memory with Rison this is G
skills Flair X kit which will just work
with Rison which is cool although again
this is a little bit more expensive you
can find compatible memory for a little
bit cheaper than this but this is a 3200
speed kickass latency 14 my
recommendation would be once you choose
your motherboard look at the
compatibility chart for that find memory
that has been tested with your
motherboard and a rising processor and
then find the memory that's the fastest
and the highest capacity that is all
compatible I wanted to liquid cool in
this system mainly to test out the
liquid cooling support of course for the
case but also liquid cooling is nice
I've got the inner max the fusion 240
here which has some fancy RGB lights on
it this one is about 110 220 dollars
right now you can't get buy cheaper
going with air cooling or something like
that of course but that's the beauty of
building your own PC you can choose
whatever options you want for storage
right now I'm just using a 500 gig nvme
drive my candidate here is the OCZ Rd
400 although it does appear like OCC has
stopped shipping these they're harder to
find in the description you'll find a
parts list that has a few alternative
parts with a DIF nvme SSD drive
specifically the WD black which you can
get for a very reasonable price right
now for the 512 K version similarly we
have a pretty overkill power supply the
HX 1000 I from Corsair here I'm using
this because most of my other power
supplies are currently in use I've
recommended an 850 watt power supply in
the video description again that's only
about $80 so you don't have to
necessarily spend quite this much but
getting a good power supply that's 80
plus gold or platinum rated that's fully
modular and that has all black cables is
generally what I go for so those are the
parts I'm building with today I will
stop along the way to give some feedback
on the define s2 and of course all these
parts are linked in the video's
description the stuff I'm using right
now as well as what I would recommend
you build with if you're trying to build
a system that's very similar to this
that's assuming that you're really sold
on ray-tracing
already I guess which you shouldn't be
until we can test it further but I know
there are some people out there who are
like I want to build a system with the
RT X 2080 this is kind of the ball park
system I recommend to pair with this
graphics card okay
they define us to is now out of the box
and I should point out that I have the
gunmetal gray version this is available
in four different varieties there's the
standard black with white accents there
is the blackout version where you don't
get the white accents on some of these
io shields and everything
there's the gunmetal gray version that I
have and then there's also a white
version all of them cost the same price
hundred fifty u.s. dollars now both side
panels are just held on by thumb screws
in the back so you don't have the push
button thing like fractal has used
before but it is still a simple means of
getting your side panel on and off like
many cases and one thing that I really
like they've done here with the tempered
glass is there's a metal frame going
around the outside of it this is
actually very similar to what I did with
Arctic Panther where I cut a piece out
and then put a piece of tempered glass
in there this actually isn't terribly
heavy either which I think might mean
that they were able to go with thinner
tempered glass here because it's got
that reinforcement from that metal frame
but point being it just pops in like any
normal side panel would so it's pretty
simple to get on and off and it does
kind of pop into place here there's a
couple little catches that hold it so
you don't necessarily need to put the
thumb screws in to get it to stay there
beyond that you've got a standard ATX
layout they do include 340 millimeter
fans and these are very nice fractal
fans that I've used before and they're
very quiet and that is a pretty nice
add-on for a case something you don't
often consider with the case that might
only come with one or two fans is fans
can cost you know 10 or 15 bucks plus
for a nice one so three of them included
it's nice there is some space in the top
here and this is that mod you vent panel
mod you vent 3 push the button and that
pops up when I was taking the case out
of the box this popped off and actually
getting it to pop back in wasn't super
easy I think it might have something to
do with the fact these little prongs
here are pushing some upward pressure on
it but this you push there and it
releases these catches and that sort of
holds it in place
and then of course since this is a mod
you vent there's a dust filter right
there so if you want vertical airflow to
come at the top which I'm going to need
I'm gonna be removing this solid panel
here to just reveal the mesh underneath
so that we can have it air flowing out
of that also up on top here you have
this removable panel that's underneath
the module vents and this is held on
with screws along this side but you
can remove this so you can install your
radiators if you want to this supports
up to a 420 millimeter radiator if you
go in with 3 by 140 or you can do 360 if
you go 3 by 120 as well as pretty much
most sizes beneath that for the front
you can fit up to a 360 millimetre
radiator and then I also want to point
out they put a fill port right here on
the top point for that but this is
spaced off to the right so it'd be away
from the motherboard tray and I would
have a question as far as vertical
clearance up in here if you've got a
motherboard with really fat heat sink so
that stands out a little bit farther or
even if you're going with something like
an air cooler in here just because
there's not a whole lot of vertical
space above the motherboard just
something you probably want to keep an
eye on if you're considering
compatibility for the parts that you
choose here's a quick look at the
opposite side and here again this
fractal is done for quite some time
we've got some sound dampening patent
padding here to prevent sound from
leaking out this mounts pretty much the
same way that the tempered glass piece
mounts on the opposite side else in here
you can see the integrated fan hub
fractals calling this the Nexus Plus pwm
fan hub that's actually got six headers
that are not PWM those are just voltage
control three they do have PWM and then
of course you can wire this up to your
motherboard so it can operate those at
the speed based on your CPU temperature
or whatever other how do you plug it
into I've got some velcro straps here
for vertical routing of cables up and
down I also got some nice rubber
grommets for passing through your cables
tie-down points scattered throughout a
couple removable 2.5 inch mounts there
and then these removable 3.5 inch mounts
and these are new for this design so
just a single thumb screw holds those on
at top these are metal cages and they do
go completely around the 3.5 inch drive
I also got 2.5 inch mounts in there too
so it's not wasted space if you're not
using 3.5 inch drives the side mats here
you're also gonna have the silicone
o-ring zin them to provide some
vibration dampening and then behind the
drive cages you can see those vertical
mounting points and that is what Kyle
has dubbed the reservoir or the wall of
mounting various mounting capabilities
so if you're gonna mount a pump or
something on the opposite side you can
do that down here at the bottom we also
have some accessories and accessories
are pretty much what you would expect I
do like the fractal still individually
bagging the various screws for various
different connection points they've also
got an adapter here for fan
they've also got some zip ties in there
a little YP to wipe down fingerprints
and then this accessory which I actually
like I thought it was fairly thoughtful
it's just a three SATA extension or
adapter so that will kind of line up
with where you're three 3.5 inch drives
would be so and you just need a single
SATA plug to power all those drives and
finally hopefully finally before I start
building let's go over dust filters I
really like the dust filter solution the
track tile has been using for the define
series goes across the entire bottom of
the case so if you got any intake fans
down there or of course your power
supply as well it handles that and you
can access it from the front which means
you don't have to like get all
inconvenient with your case in order to
get at that there is also hidden dust
filter so they're a little bit harder to
get at mature in the intakes so this is
a solid front piece and if there is a
criticism for airflow for this case it's
probably gonna be this all upfront fees
but fractal says you do get intake from
the sides of these pretty well or well
enough and they did include removable
dust filters there as well which I
thought was kind of nice now they're on
both sides again you just have to pull
off this front panel to get at them
alright guys I'm just reassemble
everything here the build is pretty much
installed and good to go things got a
little complicated but I think it was
mainly the power supply's faults cuz I
was missing a SATA cable other than that
though I do want to point out that the
front panel connection points for this
motherboard actually counted down and
further towards the back and the front
panel connector cable is a little short
on this case it's just enough to reach
the bottom right corner where most
motherboards had the i/o but if it's a
little bit further off you might have a
slightly harder time I was able to still
get that plugged in but I did have to
stretch the cable over there also for
the front panel USB type-c the USB 3.1
gen2 those cables can only be 60
centimeters long max which i believe is
what fractal has gone with with this
case but also with this motherboard that
plug is down at the bottom and a little
bit to the left so it was a little bit
further away but it was still enough for
me to just get it over there and plug it
in here's a quick look at the rear side
my kill management's even though I have
a long power supply down here I still
have a pretty good amount of space down
there to shove cables I did not spend a
long time on the cable management as you
can probably tell but I do like having
these velcro straps in the middle to
kind of consolidate stuff and cinch it
down I'm only using the fan hub at the
top here to power my CPU fans right now
and that was just because of convenience
and then I do want to point out that
these side trays here actually work kind
of as cable pastors to hold those in
place when you don't have a 3.5 inch
drive installed their time now to peel
our protective plastic off of the
tempered glass oh that's a nice easy
peel not bad at all actually before I
put that side panel back on let's stick
with the PC building superstition and
give ourselves a quick test boot we got
power on got lights apparently I did not
connect the front panel connectors part
that should work
huh there's a surface Mountain button
work oh yeah
surface mount button works so I guess I
did somehow and properly connect my
front panels yeah do another own thing
all right so my front panel connections
weren't plugged in properly and I'm
gonna completely blame that on MSI Spore
manual here for this motherboard usually
you have like a full picture of the
motherboard pointing about what is
what's and you just you don't have that
here so this is literally the front
panel connector page they show you the
pin outs here but they don't exactly
show you where it is on the motherboard
but because of that I was just blindly
like searching down here for these pin
outs at the motherboard here and I
accidentally plugged all my front panel
connectors into a USB header instead of
the front panel header more to the point
though the system is working so that's
that's good I didn't want to bother with
all those I've literally just plug the
power switch back in but that is enough
for me to be able to turn the system
back on and say look it works
okay one more peel so now that I've
built the system and the new fractal
define esta to what do I think I like it
it's a good case still maintains
fractals build quality very solid thick
steel panels and everything not a lot of
flex to the entire build also everything
feels like it comes together pretty well
the sound dampening stuff keeps things
quiet I like when I turn out build on
for the first time like a system that I
haven't even gotten into Windows and
adjusted any fan settings and everything
is just really quiet which is definitely
this system right now it's super quiet I
also really like with fractals done with
the i/o including the USB 3.1 gen2 via a
type-c connector and they have USB 2.0 a
couple as well as USB 3.0 a couple of
those as well and I like all that
flexible connectivity right at the front
of the case that's some criticisms for
this case I think it would just be the
module vent top panel here it doesn't
exactly sit down there easily it's a
little tough to get at to actually sit
there and be in place especially with
the little button at the back that pops
it up it's easy to get off with that
button but putting it back on it's just
okay of course it's really easy that
time the only other thing I think I
would add here is if Franklin could
include a couple 2.5 inch drive mounts
to go up here in the front
those two mounts that are included at
the back
you can remove and put up here in the
front so if you have some SSDs that you
want to show off you can put them there
it would just be nice to have those
included so you didn't have to buy more
accessories in order to maximize the
number of 2.5 inch drives that you can
install here
my final criticism is the price is
pretty expensive one hundred and fifty
dollars is getting up towards the higher
end of cases that are available so even
competing with stuff like fractals own
define r6 which has a few more features
than this case does but I think fractal
has done a great job putting everything
together here I like the inclusion of
the 340 millimeter fans as well and I
think for anyone who has the money and
likes this style of design of this case
you'll have a pretty good time building
your system in it and not doing
performance testing right now so there
still is more to be said about this case
but my first impressions are definitely
positive so I'll post link to this down
in the description below check it out
again available in four different
varieties right now and thank you guys
so much watching this video hit the
