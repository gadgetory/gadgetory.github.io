review review of jo-ann tech lovers
review of the msi ge62 apache gaming
laptop today paul's review review is
brought to you by pauls hardware net
where among other things you can buy
t-shirts like this one to impress your
friends and to support the cause of
course since this is a new series i'm
going to give a brief explanation you
see there's a lot of tech reviewers out
there but how can you know which reviews
to choose from paul's review review is
here to review those reviews so you can
be confident in your review watching
decisions speaking of if you watch this
video and you decide you want me to make
more videos in this series please let me
know by hitting that like button so
Joann published her review of the msi
ge62 apache gaming laptop on february
2nd on her youtube channel
joann tech lover i'll do what everyone
does and just skip straight to Joanne's
conclusion I guess all that's left to
say is muah see you next time
actually before she said that she gave
two pretty full lists of pros and cons
but overall she liked the laptops gaming
capabilities and features like the RGB
keyboard and SD card slot for cons she
mentioned the Windows key position on
the keyboard which I agree with and the
lack of an SSD which I'm gonna address
later jo-ann's review was very thorough
though which is awesome because it means
that my video doesn't really have to be
to provide some basis up for comparison
here's my less thorough overview of the
msi ge62 apache
which has a starting MSRP of 13 $99.99
for the lowest end configuration that i
have here the top is brushed metal with
some angled contours that look quite
pleasing but it is a fingerprint magnet
as you might expect
however the gaming G Series logo does
light up and wind-powered on the front
has centered Wi-Fi battery and drive
activity lights with speakers on the
left and right and then along the right
side is a DVD burner USB 2.0 port SD
card reader and power jack while on the
left side you have separate mic and
headphone jacks three USB 3.0 ports mini
DisplayPort that can do 4k at 60 Hertz
HDMI that can do up to 4k at 30 Hertz
and you can do video from both of these
to connect to tour external displays
effectively giving you three displays at
the same time then also there's an
Ethernet jack for the killer e 20 200
and a Kensington lock along the back
edge is a red accent stripe and exhausts
for the duel fans on either side this is
my preferred location for laptop exhaust
by the way build quality overall is
sturdy and according to the media kit
the G 62 weighs in at five point two
nine pounds or 2.4 kilograms which isn't
too bad for a gaming notebook
although the MSI website right now says
five point nine five pounds which is
what Joanne said which is why we say two
different things when it comes to the
weight of this laptop also it's only one
point one four inches or 28 millimeters
thick again not quite ultra book status
but still quite trim for a gaming system
inside you can see the 15.6 inch 1920 by
1080 anti-glare screen which msi says is
an IPS level TN which i think is them
trying to say it's one of the newer TN
panels that doesn't suck and it does
have pretty wide viewing angles and
decent color reproduction for a nine
non IPS display up here there's also a
720p webcam and then down below you have
your full RGB backlit steelseries
keyboard which has a ton of color
configuration options in the software
that joann did a really good job walking
through in detail but i do want to point
out that you have a range of shortcuts
available via the function button on the
keyboard and a couple dedicated buttons
up near the power to turn the fans to
max to cool the system if needed or to
launch the SteelSeries engine software
directly the keyboard backplate and
trackpad are also finished in brushed
aluminum which again looks nice but I
wasn't particularly fond of using it on
the trackpad as the texture provides
resistance against your finger moving
left to right but not up and down also
as mentioned earlier I agree with Joanne
that the placement of the windows button
here wasn't my favorite I didn't do a
full unboxing of this laptop so here's a
quick look at that it is well packaged
and comes with a pretty decent sized
power brick which will add some weight
if you're traveling also documentation
and software's included including a
6-month xsplit trial subscription next
I'll move along to specs but also into
uncharted territory as I take on some
subjects that Joann actually did not
from the bottom of the G 62 we can see
plenty of ventilation rubber feet and a
warranty void if removed stickers I
asked them aside what the deal is with
these and if they really don't want
people opening up their laptops they
said that it's basically a preventative
measure
if you know what you're doing and you
don't do something stupid like punching
holes in the PCB or filling the housing
with peanut butter then you'll still be
okay warranty wise I've listed these
specs on left though the highlights are
the core i7 4720 h2 quad-core CPU nvidia
gtx 960 5m2 gigabyte discrete GPU and
eight gigs of ddr3 l memory as mention
though this is the lowest end model so
inside there's lots of expansion
available the 2.5 inch hard drive is our
only mass storage that ships with this
laptop it's a one terabyte drive it
comes installed so the downside to
getting this version and then adding
your own SSD later would be that you'd
have to migrate the windows 8.1
operating system over but it does give
you the option to choose your own m to
drive or drives to fill any of these
three empty slots higher-end models can
come with SSD arrays pre-configured
using these m dot two spots and
something msi calls super raid 2 that
can get you read speeds of up to 1500
megabytes a second that's pretty awesome
you can also see to som slots the 2
speakers and the subwoofer for the
Dynaudio speaker system and the dual fan
cooling solution with three heat pipes
dedicated to the 965 m also there's a
six cell battery I did run some
benchmarks so here's a quick look at
those I got about the same fire strike
score as Joanne and MSI for that matter
just below 4800 by comparison a
full-size desktop gtx 960 will score
about 7000 on this test so not bad at
all for a gaming laptop BioShock
Infinite and Metro last light were also
reasonable scores please keep in mind
that I'm using the highest settings for
these tests at 1080 with 4x
anti-aliasing you'll be able to play
these games just maybe not with
everything turned up to ultra like that
I also want to do a quick gaming demo so
I just played through some Crysis 3 and
some battlefield 4 since these are very
demanding titles there's a quick bit of
battlefield 4 gameplay for you guys
basically I had to set everything to
between high and medium settings in
order to get a framerate that I deemed
to be nice and playable which is above
60 frames per second right now I'm at
about a 75 to 80 frames per second
although is different
a little bit earlier when I was running
through the hallways but also as you can
maybe hear right now the fans are
kicking into pretty decently high gear
but we are using the more strenuous
setting in the msi menu x up a little
crysis 3 yeah this game is just a really
difficult one on a lot of systems so i
had to mess around with everything and
eventually I settled on pretty much low
settings for graphics quality and
everything am able to have fxaa on but
I'm kind of hovering right around 60 to
70 FPS and sometimes dipping a little
bit below I'm also doing pretty terribly
right now I also noted that MSI included
xsplit and has marketed this as a laptop
not just for gaming but also for
streaming so here's a quick streaming
demonstration remember that streaming
while you game on the same system is
very intensive as the CPU also has to
encode the upload stream on-the-fly
so here is a live streaming
demonstration I'm streaming to my twitch
channel which is pulse Hardware I'm
using just the laptop so I'm using the
webcam to show my face to the stream I'm
using the xsplit games game caster
software that comes with it you get a
six-month license for that I'm live
streaming at 720p and I'm playing
Bioshock which is giving again I tried
to aim for above 60 frames per second so
I'm getting 60 to 70 75 ish right now
holding pretty steady and and I played
Bioshock because it was a little bit
easier on on it than Crysis 3 or
battlefield 4 that I did earlier but uh
doing really nice so far I actually have
some people watching me on the stream
you guys might be able to see I'm
streaming at up there in case you didn't
believe me but yeah CPUs getting up to
about 83 84 GPUs about 65 and I am color
me impressed that I'm getting such a
nice smooth streaming experience all
from this single laptop so to sum up my
review of Joanne tech lovers review of
the msi ge62 Apache gaming laptop I'd
have to say that JTL did a very good job
she was very thorough and she covered
just about every aspect of the product
she even mentioned some good details
like recommending for example that you
game with the AC power plugged in or it
will switch
matically to the integrated graphics or
that the screen uses embedded
DisplayPort signaling which has a range
of benefits including power savings I
then feel that her review ran a little
bit long and that some more obvious
details could have been left out just
for the sake of brevity also I always
want to see the internals of laptops but
hopefully my video here will help
satisfy that need for anyone out there
who wanted to check out their upgrade
options overall though great job Joanne
and keep up the good work
on your channel as from my opinion of
the ge62 Apache I was quite impressed
with the capabilities and feature set of
this little laptop being able to game
albeit at somewhat reduced settings and
stream while using a webcam on a single
laptop could make this a great option
for someone just getting into streaming
or someone who wants a mobile option for
road trips I will say that the fans can
be loud well under load and the system
can get pretty warm too but I've
definitely experienced worse in a laptop
and the fans do keep the CPU and GPU
cool enough for some pretty intense
workloads
also the MSI shift software that comes
pre-installed runs in sport mode by
default which overclocks the CPU and GPU
just a bit while also increasing the fan
speed so if you're ok with a little bit
less performance you can do comfort mode
or green mode which quiets things down
with a small performance hit finally as
with many laptops there are variations
out there too so if you liked almost
everything about the ge62 Apache you can
try out the ge62 pro which has a gtx
970m
or the GE 72 which is a bigger one with
a 17 inch screen but I want to know what
you guys think of this laptop of course
but also of Paul's review review in
general because I actually had a lot of
fun with this video and I'd be happy to
make more just like it if you want me to
so hit that like button comment share
the video subscribe if you haven't yet
and don't forget to swing by Paul's

you next time everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
