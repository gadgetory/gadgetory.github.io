hardware this is just a quick video
because I need to keep posting videos to
my channel um because people have been
asking for it but anyway i'm on the
living room it's sunday we've just been
doing some cleaning and whatnot today
and my channel is called paul's hardware
and I want to keep focusing on hardware
and eventually what I want to do is
bring in actual new hardware for you
guys and do unboxings and everything but
that's still sort of in the works that's
kind of Paul's hardware beta for right
now but I did at least want to share
some with you guys so what I'm going to
do is go over my sort of home theater
living room system that I have set up
and configured so first off there's my
TV TV / monitor the 47 inch jvc I've got
a fantastic beyond this because it was
actually some shipping damage which you
may be in and see it's at the top it's
like a tiny little crack and the stand
was busted but because that I got a
fantastic deal and unfortunately because
otherwise there's no way I could have
reported a TV that day I just had to
wall mount it so I got a little rose
Wilma going on in the back there which
is probably pretty dusty down here we
have sort of the center or whatever
things attached to this is my uncle
receiver do I even know what this is
put some models ah ok this is my onkyo
AV receiver HPR 960 which is pretty
overkill for my favorite apartment it
was like a 7.1 surround sound thing
actually to the speakers are over there
not even being used I've got to set up
for 5.1 so clip on either side here and
we also have a center channel there also
have three channels in the back over
there and over there and those are great
but I eventually maybe we'll move
somewhere bigger and absolutely all set
up template1 also have xbox 360 down
there this just a little four gig
version also which she probably also
maybe can barely see is my home theater
PC it's right next to the xbox cable guy
it's kind of the same type of girl that
you medicine and the original computer
pc build video to either youtube channel
on newegg it works great I actually kind
of forgotten the specs of it that I
didn't tell core i3 2105 Sandy Ridge
processor in there it's got like four
gigs of 1333 memory and it's just
running on the HD two thousand graphics
that were tricked the blu-ray playback
and everything we've got a little bit
also use the xbox so someone
infrequently but we do have that
available of an htpc this is a little
iogear board and what something about
iogear i really like out here because i
lost love for this board with my
keyboard wireless keyboard it's also got
like a trackball up there and mouse
click here so it's a keyboard a mouse on
one great for mtv pc and i emailed them
about like buying a replacement oh love
for a wireless nub they just 71like no
problem sent it over it's pretty
fantastic event anyway also first to the
xbox 360 controller
assortment of remote controls here for
TV and home theater PC and the uverse
cable box which is down there looks good
also the Xbox Kinect no sense it right
there it's great for dance central you
guys want to take a look at my circuits
of old movies and everything like the a
playstation 2 xbox xbox 360 down there
some of my favorites predators this
favorite get sure he's a good one first
we have the lord of the rings blu rays
here as well as the harry potter blu-ray
we're don't family guy dvds off to the
side you guys not notice i have just
sort of a lonely monitor sitting over
there that's because that sometimes i do
will build up here this is kind of
setting out for me I've got some plugs
set up over there so I can just kind of
plug in a computer if needed and set it
up fruit configuration and everything
but that is pretty much it for my
current home theater system as you can
see here's a little bonus footage
actually so you guys have probably
already seen my wife computer the orange
so that here I've also used it for
several minutes EV videos on Windows 8
so just in case you're wondering around
this side of the room it is my wife's
old computer so as you can see she's
sticking with orange team this is also a
ninja XD case if she originally found
kind of more of a copper color but it's
got a very funky look it's really unique
we kinda liked it I'm but see if you've
got a vertex to at this stage is kind of
a mess in there hi brutes whoa hey added
over custom van at the back to kind of
picks up the airflow on the case and
chocolate pretzel this has been working
really great for my case you're
wondering up inside I also sort of
forgot so it's a core two duo e8500 and
also a asus p 5 NB motherboards so old
socket 775 seven seas due for an upgrade
then the new one she's super just fine
so thanks a lot for watching this video
