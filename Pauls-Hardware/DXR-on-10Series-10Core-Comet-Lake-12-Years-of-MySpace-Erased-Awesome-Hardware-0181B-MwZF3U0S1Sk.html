in my I know it's completely wrong with
this idea in my head when we live stream
it's like a it's like a printer like an
old printer that kind of spools up and
starts firing up a bunch of things and
then somehow becomes Dubey it's it's a
very it's an abstract thing I'm usually
usually it only comes to mind later on
in the show but all right explains why
even trying to time the spooly that's
true so you did like benchmark that to
see if likely really your expectations
are no it automatic it Auto it Auto
played from your video into one of those
into a very reliable Ines Tech video see
you twos youtubes wasteland thinking
that I've ever watching lttp no all
right hey guys sorry we're kidding
distracted already welcome to awesome
hardware this is a live show we
discussed technology computers other
random stuff we stream every Tuesday
evening to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware as well as our YouTube channels
bit wid over here my friend Kyle there
you go we already stream the first half
of today's episode which is number 181
to his channel so that's linked in the
description if you missed it if you're
watching us live though you're awesome
thank you for joining us whether you're
watching on YouTube or on Twitch we love
you or porn oh you guys are awesome
pornhub did this
can we triple stream to pornhub we would
be we are awesome
speaking of pornhub occasional use of
adult language and adult themes on this
show nothing grotesque or anything like
that mind you but just wanted to warn
you and get that out there ahead of time
also we do in buy alcohol on the show we
attempt to do so responsibly we
encourage you to do that so the same we
encourage you to do that see how it
birdied it the whole thing if you also
intend to do so responsibly of course as
Kyle has just demonstrated that was
impressive Kyle I didn't spill anything
I don't worry a responsible adult
is there crack another beer I was gonna
say cheers and welcome to the show
cheers so today guys thanks welcome to
the show killed mine I'll get Callaghan
a second oh yeah glorious glorious
alright okay cheers cheers Cheers
thanks for being here you didn't have to
be and you probably shouldn't notice it
I think one of the dogs is going after
the bottle cap that you just put on no
no you're here oh no no it's not
something that he would usually go after
sorry that's here he's he's he's my big
ol hundred pound Italian Mastiff pitbull
mix he's a massive he's lovely follow
him on Twitter he's terrifying leave
that hero Hardware hsir Oh anyway yeah
we before we get into the tech news we
sell stuff on our stores if you want to
buy stuff please feel free to do so and
we thank you for it
plus our bread net is my store wide
range of stuff here you didn't just
break anything my thumb screw logo on a
variety of things including t-shirts
mugs pint glasses check it out we got
full-color 15 ounce mugs including ones
with the new captain thumb screw then
that looks good wraps around the mug
hell yeah captain thumb screw inside
joke that you will cherish forever that
noise your neighbor sure it doesn't
matter perhaps CalSTRS bit with that
tech slash door he also has a bunch of
real nice stuff so check it out and buy
things he's like this like the RIP
gamepad ripped game pad look at that
that PC master-race classic PC
master-race forever that poor controller
if you buy stuff during the show we will
shout out your name and johnson at you
during the after party which is coming
after might have the show this is true
alright let's dive back into tech news
my wife is coming home soon so dogs
might get upset try to warn you guys
ahead of time of course tech news though
NVIDIA has recently announced at GTC
which is going on this week in
California it's also GDC is going on I
feel like these haven't always gone on
at the exact same time but they are
right now it's quite confusing
anyway GTC is the one that Nvidia puts
on it's called the game technology
conference but Nvidia hosts it so they
have at this event announced many things
and the thing that I think is most
interesting to you folks is the fact
that they are bringing DXR ray-tracing
support to the GeForce 10 and 16 Series
in April it's next month nice keep
playing with the knife there cap sorry
that's fine I'm nice it's a nice knife
this is a good knife Spyderco yeah the
end of it is duller if you want to if
you want to do anything sharpness rated
part the serrated pright here still like
oh my god oh very very dangerous
I love a couple more drinks and tested
oh good good good call anyway though so
this was somewhat expected I mean some
people might not have expected it but it
depends how closely you watch the
development of of DirectX and
ray-tracing support in RTX and
everything that's going into that
because Microsoft has been developing
the DirectX ray-tracing API with two
tiers of hardware in mind for quite some
time now so you've got hardware
accelerated which would include in
videos RTX series graphics cards
intercourse stay specifically named the
March X with an R at the beginning not
because they're like pirates but because
R is for RTX and ray-tracing and the
hardware acceleration parts of those
GPUs that helps them do that he R stands
for RDX our stance right yes exactly
exactly how but even if you don't have
that Hardware part of it the hardware
acceleration built in like the r-tx
cards have you can now still do
ray-tracing or at least you will be able
to do that once the driver is released
it supports it
the this is talking about the two
families a drink here it is done here
tens of millions of dxr GP is here the
ones that will not be supported
basically on top of the RT x cards that
already had it which will support
complex RT affects multiple RT effects
and hi ray counts you now can also turn
on RT x effects with basic RT effects
and lo ray count with Pascal GPUs go it
all the way down to the GTX 1066 gig so
basically GTX 1066 Keoghan above also
included are the newer touring 16 series
cards that have just launched in the
past month or so the 1660 and 1660 TI
titan v Voltas included therefore the
three of you that might have that and so
there you go you too can now turn on ray
tracing in battlefield 5 and have your
framerate crippled and be like wow look
I can see things that are off-screen
reflected in this reflection and then
turn ray tracing back up so you can play
at a reasonable frame rate Pascal frame
rates have never been lower yeah Vidia
ad that's really supports rate now you
know the RT x stuff has been shat on a
lot and I think that's because a the
cards that have the hardware support for
it are really expensive and B it hasn't
really been demonstrated to people that
the extra dollars that you pay for that
support translate to like a better
gaming experience or more immersive
gaming experience you can demo RT x
stuff but you know it's still only
available in a very limited number of
games so in my opinion ray tracing and
the support for ray tracing is kind of
going through like a teething period
right now or like an adolescent pack
word teenager period or like it kind of
sucks yeah and and and you know there's
there's no real way around that but the
fact that the support for it is going to
be there with this series of cards which
has an ax massive install base because
the ten series has been around for two
and a half years now means that there's
gonna be more people who can turn it on
which means there's going to be more
developers who think like alright adding
a little bit of a little bit of the
ray-tracing sauce in here might be worth
doing so we'll see it gradually expand
and eventually we'll see you know GPUs
have better hardware support for it that
aren't crippled by it by it when you
here's again say about this brief brief
Doug freakout thick now what I was gonna
say is here has a really awesome bark
like it oh yeah we call his big boy bark
yeah I'm like Oh deep like that would
freak you out but he only uses that one
like it's an intruder or something like
that when it's like me or my wife or
something he's it's the old
bait-and-switch yes there's no Jesus
Christ there goes my leg so it was this
thing ray tracing I think has a future
ahead of it but as far as practical use
right now it's very limited s lafiel I
feel like they picked the worst game to
like showcase it on at first which is
battlefield 5 like it's a terrible game
to feature that you're moving too fast
you can't appreciate any of the nice
little effects like implement it in a
slow game where like the character
movement is slow and you need psmith
article and you take time to appreciate
your environment like an artsy game like
a modern-day version of mist or
something like that yeah I missed I
always think back of like you know maybe
like heavy rain if you if you ever
played ps3 that game on ps3 that would
have been a good one for all the
reflections in the water and stuff it's
just very
slow puzzle game maybe even something
like a little bit more slow-moving like
Resident Evil 2 like the remake and
stuff not battlefield 5 people things
are going too fast for you to even
appreciate to smell the flowers to smell
the roses or whatever portal 2 great
example yeah yeah or yeah I like
something that has a simpler design
aesthetic so it doesn't crush the
graphics card as much would also be an
option mirror store simulator perfect so
anyway just to sum up the rest of the
things that were talked about Nvidia
says that there are TX cards are two to
three times faster than the GTX cards
when you compare them I personally have
zero interest in doing comparative
testing for that because it's a limited
application but we'll see how it goes
that's of course gonna be workload
dependent as well and dependent
depending on the game and everything but
you will probably see a little bit
better performance with 16 series cards
and r-tx
effects than 10 series cards because 16
series cards do have volta or the the
architecture that's based on volta for
the core architecture which means it can
do FP 32 and int 32 integer floating
point instructions at the same time
concurrent processing of those which is
why it's also that the 16 Series is
scoring much better and tests that are
for Asus for asynchronous compute is
let's try and talk about that yeah so
yeah I guess that might be one advantage
of the 16 series cards but we'll see if
anyone's actually interested in that it
is a driver driver level support that's
going to be launched so games won't
actually require an update for it you
just need the driver and they can turn
it on in the game but some games a lot
of games probably will update because
introducing support for these lower end
cards probably would mean that the games
want to say like hey here's a here's an
entry level
RTX thing to turn on or something like
that so you can attempt it with those
games but we'll see how that goes
this will be enabled within videos next
driver release which is expected next
month so April okay next up also from
the GTC or going along with GTC is a
demo that's being shown
GTC nvidia Gogan owl god which i just
wanted to show you guys cuz i'm gonna oh
my gosh it's it's kind of cool so AI
deep-learning studied a bunch of
pictures like a ton of pictures over a
million images including 41,000 from
Flickr to allow you to do something like
this and there's a video here that
actually would probably be better to
show you so here you use the idea right
you've got an interface here looks very
like kind of like a simple paint
interface on the left side you can draw
stuff and you can tell the interface
what you're drawing Sky Tree cloud
mountain grass you can also do stuff
like changing the color and stuff like
that but it takes a very simple image
which you're seeing here on the left and
it uses AI to draw a much more complex
image sort of filling it out to look
like a very I won't say photorealistic
but getting close to it at a glance yeah
on there right that's pretty insane so
I'll let that so like for instance right
now they're like right it's green for
grass or jungle whatever he just
switched it to rock and now suddenly
it's changed that whole part of it
related to rock he's like I just
selected water and drew water right
there and really now there is a
waterfall that has appeared right there
so um it allows you to just draw sort of
these basic structures and then the AI
kind of goes in and fills in the rest
acting as a smart paintbrush as it fills
in details we have access to this on the
sketch demo or on the sketch I don't
know if you can just go and download
this the demo itself of the player is
showing at GTC is running in on our TX
Titan so it's not necessarily light but
like I just drew a mountain just it's
like happy little trees but like as a
mountain now there's a mountain what if
you like you know drew a little red
thing in the sky and you were like this
is dragon but now put a dragon in I
don't they have like you probably have
to kind of stick to the landscape things
that they have right there black rod is
a penis it's mainly that's that's mainly
what they're trying to do with it
is possibilities yeah yeah the it's
being touted as a tool to help urban
planners game designers and architects
quickly create synthetic images but you
can imagine all of the nefarious uses of
course it could be put to as well the
future this was developed by researchers
and NVIDIA and they created a generative
adversarial Network model for producing
realistic Lansky landscape images from a
rough sketch or segmentation map so it's
pretty sweet
yeah I thought that was fun way better
than Ansel I mean I just feel like if
you if you're if you're doing anything
creative you know like I just need a
generic background but right you also
needed to be somewhat specific like to
go along with the story or something
like that yeah if you could just draw
this out and just sort of do that really
quick right and then move on from that
it'd be copyright free and it'd be
cheaper than buying a image from I stock
or something you know you want to use
for a thumbnail or something like that
that's true all right moving on
this is from last week March 13th
actually but Intel comet leaked have you
heard much about comet Laker no not so
much
well yeah comet Lake is going to be the
successor to coffee Lake and whiskey
Lake Coffee architectures impressive
processor as a coffee again drinkin
drinkin beer okay anyway the information
from this article which is from Tom's
hardware is derived from the latest
updates to intel's linux drm kernel
driver and coreboot which is previously
known as linux bios and this is
basically pulling data from those to
reveal a little bit more about comet
Lake and comment like it would appear is
is gonna launch during the middle of
this year which to many of us means
Computex usually like a launching in the
middle of the year means Computex when
it comes to pc components
so two parts of this the description of
the Linux update specifically says or
claims that comet Lake comes off of
coffee Lake which is sort of a weird
phraseology I suppose but that's what it
says the article says that that means
it's safe to assume that comet Lake is a
another refresh so 14 nanometer plus
plus plus plus plus whatever sky lake -
whatever but 10 nanometer the the 10
nanometer stuff that Intel has been
promising will launch for like the past
two or three years give or take is still
expected at the end of this year no well
that's what they said I mean it's gonna
be delayed again I feel like it would be
really really bad for them if they
delayed it yet again I don't know given
that they delayed it to the end of 2019
like I feel like it was early in 2018
when they said that I feel like they
wouldn't push it that far unless they
kind of were like alright let's go back
and lay this out again so I don't know
but anyway point being it seems like we
can expect another launch from Intel of
more 40 nanometers processors code-named
comet Lake which if you go down to the
the coreboot information core boot is an
open source project which is previously
known as Linux BIOS and it is meant to
replace the BIOS and UEFI standards but
it has a github page it is data has been
posted there that says comet comet Lake
you processors are primarily aimed which
are primarily aimed at laptops we'll
have up to six cores and that comet like
H and comet like s processors which
presumably are aimed at the desktop will
have up to ten cores
I would assume anything that Intel is
doing that has 10 cores would also
potentially have a hyper threaded
version so that might mean that what
we're gonna see at Computex this year
which is only three months away actually
April May June yeah little less than
three months away would be a battle of
two launches
well actually AMD from the image from
the rumors
seems like might launch later but they
might announce at at Computex but AMD
coming with a m4 based CPUs that using
those little rise in chip le'ts might
have up to 16 cores and 32 threads on a
single little processor Intel answering
back with this comet Lake solution with
up to 10 cores and presumably 20 threads
on a single processor and sort of the
the comparison between those might be
interesting you could sort of see it
both ways on the one hand you might look
at Intel's offering and say like alright
they've been on 40 nanometers for quite
some time but I don't know like the 9900
K is very difficult to keep cool kind of
need a 360 millimeter radiator so I
would be curious what what they could
offer when it comes to like a 10 core 20
thread part compared to an 8 core 16
thread part and what I'm gonna cut in
terms of cooling and everything and then
of course you could say the same thing
about it about AMD said trying to wedge
12 or 16 cores on two separate chip
--let's a pretty small package right
there too so you know there's gonna be a
lot of questions that need answering
when it comes to the performance of
these but we'll see this seems
reasonable when it comes to rumors and
you know various software is being
updated with information about them but
yeah that's that's all that's all I have
for the story okay look again
sure apex legends have you been playing
the apex legends cow
I played it briefly yesterday for a
monitor review yep and I was bad I
killed like two people but I did bad
should be like Jo and practice so you
can be good at it I wish I had time like
I do I wish I wish the same thing but um
apex Legends is finally launching their
battle pass
or season one this actually kicked off
this morning 10:00 a.m. so you can buy
it now if any of you guys play apex
legends you probably know it's
free-to-play so just to clarify you
don't need to pay any money for this you
don't need the battle pass you don't
don't need to pay money you can still
play the game and then why would you buy
the battle fitness ball well a lot of
people seem to be interested in this I
guess all right so if you play apex
ledges a lot and if you like the
aesthetic stuff the skins then this
might be interesting to you we're
talking about a about a $10 investment
because it costs nine hundred and fifty
apex coins apex coins are one of those
things that you buy in packs though so
the amount of apex coins to $1 changes
depending on how much you buy hmm it's a
common it's a very common technique it's
used by lots of arcades and everything
like that it's not like it's bad but you
should be aware of what's being done
when you talk about taking your cash
dollars your your your money that you
know like a dollar is a dollar or ten
bucks is 10 bucks and transferring it
over to Apex coins so the conversion
rate changes no it's like you can buy
nine hundred I think it's ten dollars
for it out for a thousand eight picks
cleans okay but then if you buy thirty
bucks worth add and I need to look up
another say if you buy more than I said
you might get less say if you might get
less I mean you might get more okay you
might get yeah sure so it's not a direct
more you buy the more you save yes but
what that's doing is it's disassociating
your your understanding of what a dollar
is worth to me this sort of abstract
Apex coins sure so that as you're
spending that on stuff you sort of you
don't make a direct association of how
much money you're spending yeah and I
would just want to point out this is a
very very common technique it's used by
lots of arcades and everything to it
ever got it Dave and dave and buster's
oh yeah you just just like I'm not
saying you shouldn't go to these places
and invest in these things or get a
battle past just know what you're
spending the techniques that they are
using
to subtly prod you to spend more money
or spend more time on the thing right
and part of that is like oh I am not
putting a quarter into a machine to play
one game right it's I am spending $10 to
get 250 tokens or credits on this thing
and then I'm gonna go play again it's
your fight across you know some absolute
and then it's use like 23 credits or
something that's why it's 958 tax coins
not just a thousand or something anyway
right
sorry yeah so if you buy into the battle
path the season one battle pass then for
the next three months you can as you
play the game you will level up up to
100 levels you can also just buy the
levels if you want for a hundred and
fifty apex coins each or about about
fifty or two dollars depending again on
how much you bought the apex claims for
the levelling up only applies to the
battle pass yes okay so you have a
person level in the game and when your
battle pass has a level they both level
up and essentially the same way by
playing the game right but this is how
they sort of they sort of differentiate
that so that your battle pass is on its
own as you play with the battle pass
there's a bunch of rewards you can get
and this is similar tool the way a lot
of free-to-play games work so you know
here's all the different levels of
rewards 950 of them be there's 100 oh
yeah
scrolls all the way down to 100
including a wild frontier badge havoc
the silver storm skin some legendary
skins that kind of thing so you might
notice as you're looking through this
that there's like 50 apex coins 58 ex
coins 50 apex coins and so on as you go
further down you get a hundred coins I
think for a few of them so point being
and I think they've they've designed
this in a relatively intelligent way if
you're gonna spend if you're gonna drop
ten bucks and that's all which doesn't
seem to unreasonably for free
unreasonable for a free-to-play game
wanting it a bunch of drop ten bucks
don't spend anything else play and level
up and do all that you will get enough
apex coins
by the next season pass right so that's
kind of their offer for the kind of like
the people who aren't just gonna be
spending money on it right to play the
game and everything fortunately all of
the things that you get are all
aesthetic so we're talking about
that's good thing stuff that goes on
your win page and more tonight skins for
the player for the heroes yeah heroes
yeah so nothing nothing that's gonna
affect gameplay or anything like that so
sure you can still play apex just fine
and not spend any money at all and even
if you don't buy the battle pass you
still have some benefits from this which
is that you can still earn a wild
frontier legend skin 18 wild frontier
stat trackers and 5 apex packs while
frontier by the way is the name of this
paddle pack or the the season anyway PC
gamer closing description if you guys
want to check it out and read a little
bit more oh the only other thing is that
there's a new legend itself his name is
octane only barely saw some gameplay
with him today he is sold separately
from the battle pass he still costs
12,000 legend tokens or 750 apex coins
so you can earn your way to unlocking
him or you can just pay about 7 pity I
don't know about that take I think they
just released the character you should
be free you know and when you start the
game there's six characters with two
that you can unlock it is free to people
now there's one more you can unlock
that's why keeps yeah I guess this is
what they have to do to keep the
momentum going right so that people
don't get tired of the game and it just
fizzles out to come with some account
for some stuff to scrutiny I said I mean
one of the things the reason I think I
have brought up Apex legends a few times
I mean it's become very popular of
course that's a that's a part of it but
they launched correctly I think I think
I mean yeah I think they still deserve a
good amount of credit for that
yeah it wasn't overhyped they didn't do
some stupid pre-beta they didn't have a
bunch of tiered launches with launched
quietly they just launched with
game that you could play on launch that
was fun to play so yeah all right living
on my space but my space what does that
mean again my space you know my space
mmm it's been so long it's launched in
2003 was the number one social media
website in 2008 forgot about my space
of course was overtaken by Facebook
after that and eventually sort of
switched and transitions to be more of a
music platform music platform content
creation platform they were apparently
doing a data migration recently oh and
they just lost 12 years of content so
see so yeah 2003 plus 12 plus 3 what
years is 2018 or 2019 anything older
than three years so they sent a message
out to their users like hey guys we
apologize for the inconvenience but any
photos videos and audio files uploaded
more than three years ago may no longer
be available on or from MySpace so that
kind of do you think they just said that
they lost it and they really just let's
clear all this shit I don't think they
would do this do something like this
unless they actually did that because
myspace isn't necessarily you know oh
well like it's still around but it's not
necessarily flourishing or anything like
that
I don't think they would want to do
something like this that would tarnish
the brand even further than I already
was there's already some data breach
that happened like in 2016 or something
like that so yeah it appeared to be they
were going through some server data
migration and just didn't have didn't
ever backed up that's crazy now what oh
yeah in my opinion you shouldn't be
relying on a cloud service to back up
all of your stuff especially if you're a
creator and you're creating you know
unique stuff it's unique but that really
sucks for MySpace to the to
have really lost that much like you
should always have a backup yeah you
know even if it's on a slow server
somewhere that he hasn't been accessed
in a while but there it is that's crazy
uh bag that's oh another is a stat
there's a stat where you go permanent
loss of contents is what they're looking
at this is an estimated 50 million
tracks by 14 million artists that's a
lot a lot of data it's gone away now for
MySpace sorry any myspace users but you
probably regretting using myspace to
this point that's why I stopped using my
space right one last news story here
this is a hardware launch or an
announcement yes an announcement an to
launch because it's available for sale
Noctua night maker of really really nice
fans although they're not always the
best color scheme has finally launched
this product that they have been sort of
teasing for a while shown it a few copy
Texas and whatnot this is the NH u 12a
okay look at it right there pretty it is
pretty pretty ugly now what this is
doing is combining first off two
flagship NF a 12 X 25 PWM fans you can
see both on the front and the back there
and push pull oh god this thing's like a
hundred dollars isn't it yes it's a
hundred dollars is it really it's a
hundred and twenty millimeter all air
cooler so you're talking about
essentially the the footprints of like a
hyper 212 it might even be a little bit
shorter than that I forget you discuss
seven out of Mike's yeah it's got 77
heat papers a video here sexy video I
mean but why that color why not
they have nice-looking fans now why put
those on it they have to make it in
their default first and then they wait
like a year two three years and then
they launch a chrome acts version of it
why would they do that what I would love
to see is a crow max version of this
with the black with the all-black thing
that they were talking about doing yes
they here look this is
HD 15 which is one of their hundred and
forty millimeter class all them on air
coolers I keep wanting to say all-in-one
and like I feel like they're slightly
cagey with the description but the way
they're describing this hundred and
twenty millimeter version is that it's
on par with the cooling performance of
one hundred and forty millimeter
versions so that's that's pretty
impressive I don't know if it's
necessarily gonna beat n n HD 15 that
seems but even if it can be kind of in
the same ballpark that's pretty cool so
you're talking about a footprint that
isn't gonna conflict with Ram look
here's use your measurement 158
millimeter height comes with both fans
comes with both fans so this is the U
14s their previous hundred and forty
millimeter version which is even taller
do so yeah they're you know
install your memory next to it no
problem that yeah it's hundred and
twenty-five millimeters wide as well
because it just uses you know you're
sorry twenty millimeter fan so yeah all
of this for the low low retail price of
$99.90
Wow I was right us it's $100 100
freaking G's dollars uh so excited until
the hundred dollar price tag why make it
black feel like if it was no one's gonna
buy this no one's gonna buy it
people are gonna buy not enough people
will buy it it's so many more people
would not care they make a bunch of
stuff for like industrial use in
whatever I feel like there may be crazy
parts are like a hobby that they do as a
lark or something like that that's why
they so constantly taunt us with like
high performance stuff in there yeah
baby really make you different colors
alright these seven heat pipes such
expensive expensive but yeah I'd love to
see like how about this same price crow
max black NF 814 F a 12 X 25 P double
fans and then the blacked-out fin stack
and everything like they had some some
demos of at Computex last year that's
that seems a lot more reasonable to me
that for $100 if it could like
legitimately keep up with all the quid
coolers that cost $100 right then why
not then then I think that would be that
would be a better deal because you'd
have zero risk of failure or like water
leakage you know it's more reliable than
an AI oh if it's gonna perform on par
with one then you take my money
Oh gladly give you a hundred bucks but
you know if you actually care about the
aesthetic of your system and you want it
to be somewhat match a little bit then
that's a deal-breaker for a lot of
people true anyway RGB is any indication
of how much system builders these days
value aesthetics I mean there was no
stopping RGB so clearly people care
about how their systems internally look
but looking forward to testing that I am
misting I am sure we will see alternate
versions at some point I just want to
see how long it takes for that to happen
yeah but guys that is that's all I got
for my show that's quick that's
relatively quick as efficient well we
were both edition today I mean I'm
trying to keep it in the 30 to 40 minute
range and I think that's great all right
party we're supposed to be a thing here
that says how much time has gone by it's
okay we're just going anyway
guys we're gonna do the after party now
where things get super loose so join us
there it's gonna be fun links in the
video's description thank you for
clicking on that thank you for watching
guys yes appreciate it if you wanna hit
the thumbs up button we appreciate that
too and to your everyday tech assuming
you keep doing timestamps because you've
been really good about that thank you so
much for that you're the man and we'll
be back in just a minute
