September I know it's the 19th of
September it's like we already are
preparing for CES I was doing my and
it's doing September things and as like
Emma I'm on top of September and then I
was like no not down all right so cool
hello everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware this is a live show
Kyle and I do every Tuesday evening at
5:30 p.m. in Pacific time we stream live
to twitch.tv we talk about technology we
drink some beer we occasionally use some
foul language so bear that in mind you
know not excessive or anything like that
but just some people are sensitive to
that kind of thing
it's know we like to point it out I'm
dwelling too much on that let's move on
we also stream the first half of the
show to one of our channels today we're
doing it to my my channel Paul's
hardware this is episode hundred and
twenty one side a when we get it but
about an hour into it will switch over
to Kyle's channel and that's linked from
the video's description if you want to
check it out thanks to all you guys who
are watching live we have people in
twitch we have people in YouTube it's
wonderful community we need to sell
we've just sells here are my dairy baby
we've just added Kyle's wife Heather as
a moderator also in YouTube chat so
everyone be on your best behavior god
help us all it's not gonna matter that I
said that all right I'll probably get
worse real quick while people hopefully
start to trickle in since our
announcement should have gone out if you
want to help support our channels if you
enjoy what we do if we bring you some
entertainment in any way help by buying
stuff you can buy stuff from my store
Paul's Hardware got net and I have a
sale going on on on for mugs I also just
added some pullover hoodies that you can
order and gray black and blue and it's
all real high-quality stuff so go there
also we're having a little contest right
now that you guys can participate in woo
you are interested in the info is on
both my store and Cal store but it's a
design contest and if any of you guys
are designers out there we have two
prized categories if you submit a design
that we like if we use a concept that
you submit you win a hundred bucks if we
end up using your actual full design
like if you
you're really good at it and you give us
like a nice image and it's vector
feckless vectors and all that then you
get 300 bucks so check it out
infos on our store pages and deadline
for entries is October 15th so do that
and maybe we will sell your merch on our
store 300 bucks that's after we pay you
that's almost an entry level video card
these days yes
yeah that's we have lots of numeric show
coming up we finally after so many years
have finally connected our store with
Brian who's done who sent us quite a few
awesome designs so hopefully we're gonna
have some of his stuff coming up soon as
well in the stories anyway cows stories
bit with that tech slash store check it
out organic convenience is that new it's
fairly new it's couple weeks a couple
weeks new organic cotton bees we both
have ladies tees on our shirts net to so
you know a lovely gift for a girlfriend
or wife or for the three percents of
female audience according to YouTube you
know that we got you covered
yeah it's more like two point two points
something but yeah we're being generous
close also hats available so thank you
to all of you who buy stuff we're gonna
shout out your names at the end of the
show
what other announcements today actually
did two announcements hold on oh I know
what the other one is so it is about my
face there's two to have two other
announcements oh oh cover at the
beginning well one of them is that it's
Talk Like a Pirate Day yeah and we would
have had their full scripted routines
set up for you guys but we don't because
I've done that before I knew it I knew
it back Wow
back in the day this is from September
18th 2013
so this is four years ago damn has it
been four years 29 we're going to play
the light thing but can I dressed up
like pirates
I was captain chassis intrusion alarm
best name ever is great and we both go
over all the news and stuff Steve and
Jenny are in there too at certain parts
so check that out it's linked in the
description if you ever want to see what
I look like with heavy mascara now's
your chance
oh yeah we're wearing mascara I like
this part at the end your joke my joke
what rhymes with white classic you
actually want to hear me tell talk like
a pirate that videos linked in the
description that's the best day to do it
it was it was fun I was like wow that's
one of my favorite that's gotta be my
top few yoga episodes that we did back
in the day all right I got to do that
for Halloween this year for awesome
hardware for Halloween maybe not pirates
but dress up and be in character and
that would be nice Anna cause I kind of
want to move it's like I say that I'm
like late September I know plenty of
time to make a costume then it's like
October 30 it's like two days ago yeah
yeah true so why don't one of them one
more announcement apparently this was
sent over to us on Twitter that and this
is based on last week's awesome hardware
which had its own share of epic epic
fails going on I can't believe this is
real this is seriously show Kyle who
ejected beer influencers face in between
episodes is actually in between halves
of the episode last week it was captured
on Twitch cowboys that is his channel it
was it was quite the classic moment but
apparently I'm oh this is logged into
your Twitter here but apparently you can
you can actually tweet it if you go to
tweet and we go Kyle fail it does it's
right there huh I'm gonna tweet Kyle
right now and
there we go alright so thank you mem for
sending that over and everyone feel free
to use the Kyle fail jiff of from last
week because they're back on Twitter
yay unbelievable so Twitter had to have
done that yes I was gay no idea how the
best gifs get nominated to be automatic
Twitter twittered give yeah is there a
try there's got to be like some there's
like it's a council of like elders or
something like that it's better the jiff
panel yeah they've Board of Directors
the some solemnly go over each jiff
and they've yes this one is worthy but
it ascends there's a little aura
surrounding it and they all do a song
and dance ritual around outworks cool
alright let's move into the first
segment well I guess technically the
second segment might have since
announcements was kind of extended today
no that's not it I'm clicking the wrong
thing that's hot anyway honey have you
heard whoo clearly established each
segment as we go into it that's part of
the show lower thirds baby alright so
we've got some some tech hardware news
heavy heavy hardware hard drives hard
drives are heavy that mez that's true
it's a perfect segue Western Digital is
shipping a 12 terabytes hard drive the
WD gold Wow they just keep adding new
colors is this enterprise or is this
committees enterprise so I don't they I
guess black wasn't cool enough anymore
for the WD black drives but WD gold it's
12 terabytes eight platters pretty the
same as far as overall storage capacity
yeah 7200 rpm it's a helium-filled drive
that's actually based on the same
platform as Hitachi's HGST or yeah
Itachi's ultra star 80 12 which also
launched earlier this this year uses
fourth-generation Helio seal technology
helium and the drive allows the spatter
the platters to spin with less
turbulence which is why they can make
them closer together and that's the
benefit there one of these is much
louder because
eight platters the helium drives I have
had or no there they're pretty quiet I
mean no no louder than you'd expect that
a decent hard drive to be that's good
you know but yeah 1.5 terabytes per
platter with eight of them in their
total perpendicular magnetic recording
this is made for near lying enterprise
environments so like you know either
high-end consumer or you know
entry-level prosumer or I'm sure these
are going to be used in data centers and
that kind of thing as well so that means
it's equipped with sensors technologies
to prevent it against vibration make it
more easy to put multiple drives into a
single like NASA array or something like
that half drives next to each other so
that they don't interfere with each
other when it comes to vibration
supports tle are or time limited error
recovery rebuilt a system ode to speed
up rape recovery time 255 megabytes per
second sustained transfer rates four
point one millisecond four point one six
millisecond average latency which are
pretty damn good specs for for a
spinning mechanical hard drive yeah is
there any price on this there is you can
buy it directly from WD for five hundred
and twenty two dollars Wow
it's available at multiple retailers
right now including Newegg for five
hundred and forty dollars so I guess you
can get a better better deal if you go
straight to WD but I don't know if you
have to have an enterprise account with
them right there's that kind of thing
yeah five hundred and forty at NUI which
you know is a lot of money for a hard
drive but considering the capacity it's
not terrible actually the article is
from an an tech by the way all the
articles I'm talking about are linked in
the video description
but thanks for instance take a look at
it this is a twelve terabyte model on
the left and it's 23 gigabytes per
dollar or about four four point three
five cents per gigabyte and again that's
based on the MSRP of five hundred and
twenty-two dollars and that's actually
you know less than then well the extra
sorry it's a little bit more than I
guess a ten terabyte and eight terabyte
drives but it is and I'm fairly new
still but it is less than their eight
terabyte drive retailed for about one
and a half years
because it launched at $600 so there you
go hey what cool hard drives I like hard
drives super I mean when I hit if nanda
prices weren't so crazy I'd be like this
is obsolete yeah that's there's gonna be
20 terabyte Nan's flash array drives
soon but I don't know no side of the
back anytime soon oh cool oh by the way
we drink beer on the show we forgot to
do that we're drinking some Lagunitas
little something mail little some and
cheers Cheers you guys thanks for
joining us mm-hmm
let's move on to the next story here and
have you heard we're all so the Sun is
setting so we're getting some there's
some extra yeah some special video
effects it's not your GPU artifacting
maybe ten no that's the special that's a
special aspect of the show that we have
now I kind of like it the shine and it's
only gonna happen for a while like give
it a few weeks and especially once the
time changes and it'll be dark by this
time so so so Sabre it what do you still
care so 56 core 112 thread workstation
what do you think that sounds exciting
that is what HP has on offer with their
new z8 workstation freaking insane core
counts and and with hyper-threading
hundred and twelve threads three
terabytes of system memory that's not
like hard drive system memory and that's
pretty crazy it's also got this like
sort of configuration with a bunch of
vents and everything to make sure that
there is airflow directed to the various
parts of the actual workstation so GPUs
yeah so the max configuration that
they're talking about here is dual Xeon
Platinum 8180 chips and the xeon
Platinum 8180 is based on skylake x SP
28 cores
56 threads per CPU with 38.5 megabytes
of cache they run at 2.5 to 3 point 8
gigahertz so even some pretty decent
frequencies on these I would imagine
when it's not using all the the cores
and threads of course support for up to
1.5 terabytes of RAM per CPU giving you
a grand total of up to 3
only craft school next year there's
actually going to be a successor to this
8180 Platinum Series II on chip the 81
ATM that's gonna have basically the same
amount of cores and the same speeds but
it doubles the total memory capacity to
3 terabytes per CPU so if you fill that
all 24 Ram slots in this with I don't
know what capacity dims I'd have to do
math do that right now but if you max it
out you could have 6 terabytes of system
memory and it will be three thousand
divided by 12 or 24 you said 24 slots
2014 6000 cuz it's three thousand per
CPU oh it's ok will be six thousand
divided by 24 yeah I can't control
things yet you can have up to three and
video Quadro p6000 GPUs to order 50 gigs
at once is 256 gig sticks
is that okay is that right does it go up
to right now on the server side I don't
know that's 32 and I think I've seen 64
do they do they have hundred
twenty-eight gig dims I mean it's just
maximum supported or are they saying
like you can spec this out with this is
maximum theoretically supported by the
CPU so theoretical support by the CPU
and dim is actually available to have
that Grasset II or definitely two
different things yeah yeah I think 64
gig is is this as high as I have seen on
the server since no we're talking about
you know in a year to when maybe there
will be Tim's enough that much professi
anyway the actual system has four
internal drive bays wait I lost my spot
to external and the third external for
an optical drive nine PCIe slots and
it's got a range of gigabits and 10
Gigabit Ethernet adapters that are
available on there the storage options
are up to 4 terabytes of PCIe mounted
SSD which I would imagine would be nvme
48 terabytes of spinning disks 10
Gigabit Ethernet 802 that 11 a/b/g/n and
AC Wi-Fi is blue and bluetooth to 4.2
Thunderbolt 3 available with an adding
card 1700 watt power supply is what they
would use to power this workstation and
all of that
hardware in there and I already kind of
talked about deducting and stuff which I
mean I'd be very curious to you know to
see some stats on this like full load
performance numbers and that kind of
thing with the fully kitted out system
two thousand four hundred and thirty
nine dollars for the lowest end model ah
which which goes down to because this is
the z8 and there's a z6 and a z4 as well
that have different other configured as
single single slot or single CPU single
sockets configurations I guess I should
say but anyway two thousand four hundred
thirty-nine dollars of the bottom spec
and the article says we'd expect the
top-end configuration to cost twenty
times that which would be forty eight
thousand eight hundred dollars I don't
know if that's speculation on behalf of
Ars Technica here or not but I mean hey
top n workstation fifty grand if you
need that much horsepower I suppose it's
worth it I guess so they're built for 3d
engineering and modeling and 8k video
production how much I wonder how much
that costs if you built it yourself like
how much you'd save would you save
anything or if that's like the exact
same exact thing high-end workstations
there's a lot of extra stuff that you
get for them at anchor things are
grossly over part forever price when you
just look at hardware costs but there's
a lot of extra stuff that you get when
it comes to support and yeah you know
validation for specific like enterprise
level software and that kind of thing
right um but yeah anyway one more item
of note here on aha and heavy hardware
this is about thread Ripper which is
some I think I would classify US patent
heavy hardware but yeah thread rivers
recently deleted binder Bower we've
talked about several of his deleting X
escapades in recent time and there was a
sort of a bunch of there is a kerfuffle
when it first happened because if you
look at some of the images here there's
a lot of speculation as to what the
extra dies are doing here because this
is basically looks the same as epic
which on the server side can have a full
complement of eight rising cores or
eight risin dies each with eight CP
you's giving you a total of up to 32
cores and 64 threads third Rupert goes
up to 16 cores and 32 threads and
they've told us that only two of the
four actual dies are doing any work so
what are the other two dies doing or
what are the what are what are the other
two dies rather they disabled dies are
they
dummy dies are they inactive dies and
when he actually deleted it they saw
that there was actual gold I believe you
can see in this image is actually gold
context on on all four of them which
might make you think that maybe they're
maybe they're inactive and of course the
next question is like oh maybe you could
actually enable them somehow or turn
them on but this is the follow up
because this is this actually posted
last week sometime I think this was
actually about the same time we did the
show last week but James Pryor who is a
product manager at AMD followed up on
this and basically said it's not an epic
it's a different substrate it's
different dies to the dice work to have
no path to operation they are basically
rocks so yeah they're not described as
inactive but dummy so it doesn't matter
if they were dead or actives they're
just not gonna work at all so anyone who
maybe had machinations on like somehow
using the pencil trick or something like
that to turn on your other your thread
Ripper core your the other thread Ripper
dies it's not gonna happen
a bummer there there was some discussion
of this online and actually Ian captures
from AMD responded with the general
workflow you mean a man tech I'm sorry
form in Antakya sure when did that
happen
well yeah so you know that they didn't
get him to but this is this is his
general workflow of starter per dies and
the Zeppelin wafer each was epilim wafer
which they can harvest about 290 dies
from some of them work some of them
don't some of them fully work some of
them don't so once it failed will either
be used for thread Ripper for the dummy
dies or they just go to landfill I guess
this is also his assumption I imagine
but and then the other dies at the top
five percent of them are sorted out and
those go to thread repair as far as
overclocking goes everything else gets
relegated to rising based products as
well as I would guess
but all the reports on AMD's yields for
horizon have been very good so I think
that's part of the reason why they're
doing so well with it you have been able
to me to keep up with demands and all
areas for my understanding alright next
segment
that's the end of the first segment by
the way I'm gonna take that was very
efficient then we didn't linger or
anything it was I don't have lots of
stuff to talk about very concise kinda
you know trying to bang through it I
also have you know yeah I didn't I did
it's good sex also like whenever have
you guys notice the lighting is better
today I mean other than the the beams of
sunlight across their face other than
that it's worse it's Chris my new intern
scales in twice a week and I've been
sort of like watching how he sets up the
lights lights - there's a big there's a
big diffuser over here it's very nice
it's a showery it's a shark it's
literally a shower curtain bunnies from
a sea snake but it's it's a diffuser
it's yeah it works great and it's
diffusing some of the sunlight too right
now which is probably giving it very
nice blend that's why that get some you
got some shout around as well
yep but if you compare it off screens if
you compare the closer
oh you compare the lighting from like
last week's video they're our last
week's episode to this one it's just
night and day it's absolutely crazy
what I just can't touch you what next
segment we're streaming Paul we tilt the
cameras go down the next segment is in
security I actually did a segment about
security and stuff this is mainly
information and recommendations that I
have found from other sources because I
don't consider myself to be an expert on
this by any stretch but I almost forgot
we actually already had a segment called
insecurity so that's over anyway point
is Equifax we didn't talk about Equifax
last week it was it was sort of new news
that last week but if you're not
familiar with the Equifax breach you
probably should be I would be surprised
if you're not but Equifax is one of the
three major credit reporting agencies in
the United States they they were hacked
and a hundred and forty three million
consumers informations
were basically stolen and they're out in
the wild there's some somewhere on the
internet now now I want to point out
here again that weren't I'm not an
expert in finance and I don't claim to
have all the answers about this but
these are actually some of the steps and
I'm going to be taking personally to
attempt to do some protection for myself
so I wanted to share that with you guys
in case you're sort of not exactly sure
what to do but you don't know what to do
this is a huge deal don't worry I told
your wife about some of this oh good
well I think you're and please the
responsible one yeah yeah this is but
basically here's a question are you an
American adult that has ever held or
inquired about a credit card loan car
bank account cell phone account electric
service water service internet service a
security clearance most jobs most
schools most apartment complexes are
renting or buying a house than you are
affected it's actually even affected
people internationally as well there's
other informations from people in the EU
that's gotten scooped up with this as
well and there's a ton of news stories
about it but I'm basically going to link
to a single reddit thread which is on
the you should know subreddit which base
which goes over some kind of steps to
take and the ultimate decision that the
thread makes and what I'm going to
probably be doing as well is turning off
my credit
now turning off your credit or doing a
credit freeze is something you need to
do individually with each credit agency
and prior to now that's actually cost
money you have to pay for it every time
which kind of sucks it's not a lot of
money but it would be you know somewhere
in the range and every time you freeze
it 30 bucks every time you freeze it
okay and then if you freeze it it
doesn't mean that like your credit card
stopped working or anything like that
any accounts that you've already opened
still work it just means that nobody can
inquire no one can do it can pin your
credit and do a credit check of course
that means if you need to get a job or
do any of those things that I just
listed but yeah you're gonna need to
turn it back on and then probably turn
it back off but this is probably your
best bet at protecting yourself in the
event that someone who has gotten your
information from this
breech which includes Social Security
numbers addresses credit histories all
of the relevant information that they
would need to perform identity theft or
anything like that yeah what a great
time to have horrible credit yeah cuz
then no one would want to steal your
identity as someone mentioned in chat
unfortunately my credit is very good I'm
a prime suspect or a prime candidate
yeah there's a bunch of nonsense that
has come out since this information
became public for instance people were
first told this sort of like crappy news
that they knew about this about six
weeks ago and then the public just found
out actually they discovered it back in
March six months ago Wow widget which
kind of sucks there's like three of
their higher-ups including the CFO who
like sold their stock in the company
prior to this going public there and
there's two two of their chief
executives like just left well like I'm
done I'm just peace out so there's
there's a ton of fallout still to happen
from this what are what I have in what
ways can you be affected negatively by
this like can someone assume your
identity you know
yeah identity theft that's not going to
open a credit card in your name right
extracts one things mentioned in the
article and in this breakdown on reddit
is people filing taxes in your name it
is a potential issue and that is a
massive massive problem if if someone is
able to do it so one of the
recommendations from the article as well
means come 2018 get your w-2s and fire
file your taxes as soon as you possibly
can that's your best bet for doing that
another strong recommendation is to get
your credit report right now you want to
get that from annualcreditreport.com the
government mandates that everyone can
get their credit report for free once a
year annual credit report.com
is the actual only single website all
the other other credit monitoring
services and everything like that are
like you know their varying levels of
legitimacy that annual credit report.com
is the actual one where you can go and
get your credit report and we're not
sure what's going to happen there's
there's there's politicians who are
introducing legislature to try to make
it harder for credit company or credit
monitoring companies to be this
negligence yeah lots more still to come
but this was the breakdown I found of it
that I found to be very helpful explains
everything very clearly and if you or
your friends or family who are I
guarantee you're affected by this aren't
exactly sure what to do I highly
recommend just checking that out and
very would very much would consider
turning a credit off if you're at all
concerned about that or if you're able
to do it super helpful fYI that's good
to know anyway yeah there's more on that
this actually is there's so much more
than that but yeah it's a really really
the the the amount of fraud that's gonna
happen this holiday season it's kind of
insane it is gonna be crazy so record
breaker you get your credit report right
now so that if anything happens in the
future you can say look this is this is
what it was before
whatever happened right and it's just
kind of a lottery like there's so many
so much information out there it's just
like are you gonna be the one who is
targeted yeah that kind of scary all
right CCleaner
is a software utility which I have
personally recommended to people in the
past ever Avast which is a company who
owns pure form which is the company who
developed ccleaner has let people know
that it's been compromised
in fact hackers were able to inject
malicious data harvesting code
piggybacked onto the installer program
for ccleaner Avast is reckoning that
this is affected about 2.2 7 million
users so that's kind of that's kind of
crappy because ccleaner is crap crap
cleaner is basically what it is and it's
very it was a very useful tool for like
if you had a notebook like a laptop that
you bought with a bunch of bloatware on
it or something like that it was very
good at going and cleaning that stuff
out but this is sort of a slightly newer
trick that I guess that hackers have
been using to
distribute their malware and viruses is
to piggyback it on software that people
otherwise trust this attack this
effective versions of ccleaner 5.3 3.6
162 as well see cleaner cloud 107.3 191
Avast piriform recommends upgrading to
version 5.3 for of seat cleaner or
higher that's what they recommend if you
have it already a just like I just want
to get rid of this because I don't want
it anymore the concern would be if your
if you had a version that was affected
now my personal like the thing I do if I
know that a computer has a virus it has
been compromised is I nuke it like I
don't care I format it I get rid of any
data that's on the hard drive and that
will that will that will solve your
problem and the vast majority of
situations you mean like in this
situation like where ccleaner like all
this all the computers like if you have
it you're like I'm just gonna install it
like you just if you want to be if you
want to be sure that you have that your
system is not compromised that's that's
just what I do have you done nothing
your systems with ccleaner on I'm
already I don't have I haven't I haven't
used recommended ccleaner recently oh I
don't think I have any systems that are
affected by this and I yeah I do have so
hotline has ccleaner on it though and
but fortunately it's an older version
it's like 5.2 something and it says the
affected one was 5.3 three so if you
don't think so if it's an older version
you're probably fine yeah mmm so um I
think I think I'm good so there you go
yeah also I mean if you're if you are
concerned or if you if you were affected
by it if you did have the software
installed it was capable of harvesting
your computer name your IP address a
list of installed software a list of
active software and a list of network
adapters which is all data that ccleaner
was you know it's the type of data that
that software would have been would have
legitimately been able to collect it is
then taking that data which piriform
describes is not insensitive and
transmitting it to a third party
computer server located in the US and
that server was shut down as its
number 15 four days ago so it's not
necessarily the most it's not like it's
got your few social security number
because that doesn't matter anyway
because Equifax but I'm yeah it's it's
at least not not like not the most
serious information it's mainly the the
the method of deployments that I think
was a little bit more of a concern elsa
that they were able to yeah to get this
actually into the installer is is a
little bit disconcerting
um indeed yeah CCleaner at the time that
piriform perform was bought by avast in
july avast has two point two seven
million users were affected but at the
time of the acquisition ccleaner was
billed as having one hundred and thirty
million users and fifteen million on
android android is not affected at all
the payload payload delivery for this
was limited because it only affected
users with 32-bit windows pcs so i guess
that would be another reason why a
hotline would not have a chance to be
affected so that's probably what limited
the amount of people considering the
actual install base of ccleaner alright
that's all for that story next is I
don't like this segment Apple it's
making me uncomfortable well it's
information that people should know
about see I did a whole segment on
phones last weekend and the iPhone X had
just been announced and I didn't mention
it all it was it was classic just a slap
in the face to Apple reverberate it
throughout the tech world I saw lots of
articles on it but anyway they do they
didn't have a few new interesting things
about the the new iPhone X for example
and the facial recognition system which
as you can see sprays you in the face
with the pleasing purple aura and this
this is alien Judas not really but yeah
it's it's it's facial recognition so
it's a bio it's a it's a biometric
unlock it's similar to like unlocking
with your fingerprints or like Windows
hello but it's a little bit more fancy
than that so this article from the verge
asks several questions about the facial
recognition system
which I will kind of go over like is it
gonna make it easier for police to
unlock your phone if you were arrested
or something like that and they think
you might have some incriminating
evidence and you're sitting there like
oh you just beat the crap out of me so
I'm incapacitated and they're like I'm
gonna unlock your phone by holding up to
your face and then and then they can get
into your phone mm-hmm and their article
does reference some kind of shady
situations where that actually comes
into play it is important to note though
that the fifth amended fifth amendment
in to the Constitution of the United
States protects you that protects what
you know and it does not protect what
you have so this applies not only to
facial recognition but something like
using a fingerprint that's something you
have and it's been there have been court
cases about it some have gone one way
some have gone the other way there's
another article that we should also be
linked in the description from use moto
talking about the iPhone case that they
believe should go all the way to the
Supreme Court this is from back in June
but it's basically deciding this a
little bit more clearly one way or the
other for people as far as what
capabilities the law enforcement has for
getting access to your personal private
information which might be stored on a
private device which is a physical thing
you have which they might have the
ability to confiscate because it's a
physical thing but if it's locked by a
code that you only know in your mind and
they're not technically allowed to get
what you what's in your mind that's what
you know they're only supposed to be
able to get at what you have then they
have to use inception to extract your
information yes exactly the only logical
means so that's that certainly applies
here now Apple specifically talked about
some of the physical challenges for
example of using this because they
wanted to make it so that you can use
use it to use your face to unlock your
phone but not necessarily should be able
to use be used like if you're asleep and
someone walks up to you with your phone
shouldn't work because if your eyes are
closed that
actually work properly it also it sprays
a bunch of red dots on your face that's
kind of what's being shown here so it
does it does a scatter you know it
scatters a bunch of dots on your face
and that reads those and it uses that to
determine depth and that is why it's a
lot fancier than just something in that
like so it can't be it can't be fooled
with a picture it actually has to be
depth there and they used a bunch of
masks to attempt to trick it and said
that it wouldn't work but there's a
possibility the idea is that your eyes
needs to be open you need to be actively
trying to unlock your phone so it should
be more difficult for someone to unlock
but not impossible yeah but some
something to consider could my face leak
or gets stolen since Apple is collecting
this information about your face and
storing it it's supposed to only be
stored on the phone itself it's not
supposed to be uploading the face print
data to the cloud or anything like that
so in that case should be okay but um
you know who knows if they change their
policies in the future anything like
that there's a question about a racial
bias which has been something that
affects face ID in the past if you're if
you're not a white person then there's
challenges there if the AI has been
trained mostly on the faces of white
people and you happen to be black or
Chinese or Indian or anything like that
then there might be more challenges
there too earlier too early to say on
that one was the let the article
concluded are you talking about
smoothing it with a picture the other
thing is that it's a motion camera so
when it's when you're unlocking there's
some motion there so that part of that
what the 3d effects is what it's like
it's not just getting a straight on shot
of of your face so it has some text some
sort of motion just subtle motion yeah
in order for it didn't unlock using the
motion capable cameras as part of the
security and the unlocking feature I
just feel like it's still wait wait
gonna be way too easy to crack once this
phone gets in people's hands like
someone's gonna like within a week or a
day like someone's gonna be like this is
the easiest thing to crack never that
was shown pretty quickly with most
biometrics lifts it's a lot of the
biometric
like fingerprint unlocking stuff but
yeah you can do it longer see you can
probably do with faces this this does
seem like a step up for example but the
other question is that Apple is going to
soon have millions of people enrolled
with face ID which gives them a powerful
face facial recognition tool as well as
input from millions of people that they
can use to train their a eye and stuff
like that and that also brings into
question of like you know can can that
knowledge be somehow used for evil or
something like that but you know we're
not really sure apples generally pretty
good when it comes to security of
preserving privacy and that kind of
thing for its users so I feel like it's
more data that they can either sell or
exploit for their own profit or like you
know for advertising whatever it is like
now they have a actual profile of your
face and they could they know what race
you are what gender you are approximate
age and whatnot and they can minimize
that I got your social security number
from Equifax I know nothing is yours
anymore we're all screwed damn it
Ozzie on that note go Android all the
way more all the story right let's move
let's move into news more general tech
news and let's move to some lighter
topics too tired of anything that
requires I know that we're all depressed
is a beam of light across my face too
even sunlight
I really just need like a sliver of tape
to cover up that one blind that's
bleeding too much sunlight I don't know
it's kind of how your retinas it's kind
of a I can feel myself growing it
makes it's like a which I needs to
respond more quickly to which one
becomes more dilated
singing act alright you've been playing
playing on this fella grounds I've not
been playing anything I've not had time
to gain in so long I want a game like
one six months on a game it a little bit
more but we've we we have played it
we've tended a bit it's a lot of fun
it's insanely popular and breaking lots
of records on Steven what not legit
reviews did a interesting little article
earlier today about
how many cores CPU core is that it is
that you need to play one layer none
spell guns this was I think I think
Nathan did yeah this is a Nate no Nathan
what they don't rip rip um he tested
with a gtx 980ti he used the medium
preset for bubba he tested about 1920 by
1080 and 2560 by 1440 with a 7900 X CPU
he was disabling cores on the CPU in
order to simulate the different core
counts options but these were basically
his results he tested two cores with him
without hyper threading four cores with
him without six cores
eight cores and 10 cores there's a
pretty decent jump going from two cores
to four threads or two cores two threads
to four cores or four threads there's
another pretty big jump going from four
cores to eight threads or going from
four cores to six cores in fact quantify
that's about a 31% jump going from two
to four about a 21% more jump going from
four to eight alright I should say going
from four to six when it comes to actual
cores going from four to eight when it
comes to thread count so good news for
anyone who is currently gaming with like
a 7700 a or 6700 or something like that
you do have a pretty good capability to
seems like max out your available
performance if you have a fork or a
thread CPU or better and again it's
pretty decent performance from the two
and four cred sorry two and four core
solutions there but that's good it's as
if you're rocking a 1080i you probably
want at least four cores
yeah I guess the solution it's nice to
see like really popular like like one of
the most popular games utilizing that
many CPU course effectively especially
to like line up with all of the you know
hike or count CPUs that have been
dropping recently kind of makes you feel
more justified in your purchase I feel
and also um player knows battlegrounds
uses Unreal Engine 4 which is somewhat
notorious for being a bit of a resource
hog so it's good
to see that they are working on some
optimizations for this and like I said
the ability to take advantage of
higher-end hardware that's out there and
given the type of game it is
you can have a lot going on at the same
time with lots of different players and
stuff so yes certainly seems seems to be
a good and I had I'm having trouble
coming up with some final closing
statement for that let's move on more
cores is better Hardware die info which
is a Dutch website or at least the
language is Dutch
but um yeah they have tested they have
physically tested and attempted to turn
on a KB like CPU and an Intel Z 370
motherboard as well as a a coffee like
CPU apparently with Z to 70 motherboard
now the the reason this is interesting
is because Intel's next generation
they're next mainstream product line is
going to be motherboards with Z 370
chipsets and then coffee like basis CPUs
which are probably enough 8000 series
based on the rumors now they're not
supposed to be compatible with the
current generation of stuff is e 270 the
z170 motherboards for scat for sky
leaking can be linked however it's still
LGA 1151 and physically there's no
difference between the chips they have a
shot here of the bottom of the CPUs and
they are exactly the same LGA 1151 yep
so they basically were like well what
happens what happens when you do it and
it's exactly as you would expect doesn't
work does it work like Intel said it's
vaguely interesting because this is an
unreleased product but also somewhat
interesting in that they were testing
like alright you can give as much
information to people as you want about
the actual configuration and what's
compatible with what you're gonna have
somebody try to drop a copy like CPU
into Anna's II 270 motherboard or vice
versa like they did yeah it didn't
destroy anything there was no smoke
basically the system boot
it went through or went through post but
when it got to the last step VGA its it
boot looped after that so yeah there's
no physical barrier to installation but
there's also no harm then or smoke or
flames or a dead motherboard or CPU if
you happen to installs the thing to
battle CPU so the limitation seems fully
software based has nothing to do with
really the hardware of the socket or
yeah I mean it might be a like a
firmware thing or yeah I mean this
there's various ways I'm sure that Intel
can guarantee incompatibility
but right physical and compatibility
something that actually blocks you from
installing it is not there that just
makes I think that would just make
people more bitter and that Prowler
Intel that probably goes to tooling for
manufacturing which is very expensive to
change up so doing something for this
new line of CPUs and motherboards that
would make it physically different what
it costs more money than it was worth
that's my guess to actually do something
to make it to make it that much
different all right a couple more quick
stories to talk about t-mobile and
sprits are possibly in an active merger
I'm gonna refresh this page real quick
t-mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom as
Frances owned by Softbank they have been
in frequent conversations about a stock
4 stock merger in which t-mobile parents
Deutsche Telekom would emerge as the
major owner oh look this video just
started playing whoa oh it's just listen
to this game hey let's just have him do
the show I said Haddon that's that video
to play he's played he's dressed for the
part scroll down the page a little bit
oh look video just stays there how
annoying CNBC but if I just wanted to
read I didn't want this dude yelling in
my favor
move on from there but yeah they say
negotiators are still weeks away from
finalizing a deal the chances of
reaching a current agreement are not
assured but this is the number three and
number four wireless carriers at least
in the United States there's
as to whether it be approved by
regulators earlier this year soft makes
my site Masayoshi Son indicated a
willingness to sell Sprint's to t-mobile
and t-mobile CEO John Legere expected
would be expected to lead any
combination that results from this
merger so yeah
so B t-mobile would be the name that
comes out of that which drive all this
house because Sprint is one of those
names that I feel like it's been around
forever right it's like you don't ditch
all that branding I guess but who knows
yeah but let's move on from that this is
just a quick story and we got Chrome hey
speaking of that annoying autoplay ad
that just played with the audio
wonderful what a wonderful segue chrome
was gonna block those thank you thank
you for complimenting my steak with that
yeah girl I'm slow and stopping those
annoying autoplay videos starting in
January
hooray so if you're good websites or
let's say you like to open multiple tabs
in your browser or something like that
at the same time then you have some
mystery tab that's playing audio it's
not terrible to locate those anywhere
most of the browser's now will have like
a little icon or something like that and
will allow you to mute a tab
specifically but when they just start
playing automatically it's really
freaking annoying so I am happy that
Chrome will be doing this should roll
out in January this is one of the most
frequent concerns from users says google
unexpected playback the worst autoplay
videos have to be the ones that minimize
and follow you down the page while
you're scrolling says the article
incidentally which is exactly what the
NBC website we were just looking at did
okay
like when I when I found these stories
by the way I found the CNBC one first so
that I was like wow that was a great
chrome 63 version 63 is also gonna add a
new option to completely mute individual
sites so you can tell that website like
like if you go to tweet town all the
time and the speak town pop-ups and just
blasts and noise in your face you can
mute the entire website and it will stay
like that
through different sessions that's a cool
feature too
google has also previously indicated
they're gonna introduce built-in ad
blocker for next year all of this I
think is generally speaking good news
but we also have to we have to like
grain of salt it with Google now because
they're not like like we use we like
Google and we use so much of their
services but they've also gotten so
large where it's like you don't see them
being just always good all the time so
it's also possible that they're using
these changes to further assert their
domination over the online advertising
industry so you know keep that in mind
too I guess
so someone said we don't we can now mute
pornhub at work oh yeah oh sure yeah
then you have on your work browser and
then you you know that it's never just
gonna start start popping up because
that'd be awkward unless you worked at
pornhub then is that normal I mean what
to work at pornhub if you work at
probably 11 or if you work at pornhub
depends on your family can you just like
be sitting there watching porn and your
cubicle or something like that and yeah
they're doing anything else some people
like this way to go get her you're
promoted know kind of curious kind of
curious about the office politics at
that burnt-up now that'd be fascinating
there should be a stupid BuzzFeed video
about that but I digress hopefully that
will get done soon all right light on it
last actual news story for today until
apparently is going to be launching ice
lake 8 core and 16 thread main screen
CPUs in the second half of 2018 yeah
this will this would be supported on the
300 series platform that we've talked
about which about not having
compatibility with current cabling
processors for example however I don't
know this is interesting I'm not a
hundred percent sure that this is a WCC
F Tech article and I'm not Hasaan I'm
not sure I don't know we'll see believe
it's you guys but this is sourced from
eurocom which is a manufacturer of high
end laptops and workstations which
awesome
up and have swappable desktop parts in
them which is pretty cool a rep from the
company revealed on no note book review
forums that they'll update their tornado
f5 laptop to the z 390 chipset which is
going to support Intel's 8 core and 660
and thread CPUs arriving in second half
of 2018 this is the actual comments
about that from the eurocom support is
there this is their actual support
channel so that's pretty straightforward
that eurocom is in the know about what
will be supported on until Z 390 chipset
Z 390 chipset is also a chipset that
kind of came out in rumors recently and
we're going to talk about this a little
bit more in Cal's half of the show but
it's it's one of those things people
weren't aware of z 370 it's supposed to
be the successor for Z 270 Z 390 might
be a higher-end option that might also
still be mainstream maybe we're not sure
yeah but Intel has definitely said that
they're gonna offer eight core and
sixteen thread processors
I am sorry we know now that Intel is
going to offer 18 eight core and sixteen
thread processors they haven't said that
but we know that based on this that
they'll be available on the mainstream
platform assuming this is all true so so
this gyro come guide pretty much spilled
the beans more or less yeah well he
seemed it was the real solution I mean
this type of stuff happens and they can
come out of be like oh he misspoke or
you know that kind of thing like he
wasn't familiar with the actual blah
blah who knows it's it's early
information but some the thing that
sticks out to me here is they're talking
about this potentially being ice Lake
because Intel has stated and some of
their and the product roadmaps and
otherwise that ice lake which is the
second generation 10 nanometer processor
architecture will be well under
production in 2018 now that's a wide
time frame but ice like his
second-generation 10 nanometer they're
supposed to be cannon Lake right right
yeah so cannon Lake is already on
roadmaps and there is supposed to be
some low wattage low low power draw can
like stuff coming out at the end
at the end of 2017 mm-hmm not
necessarily the desktop parts like
socketed desktop parts or anything like
that but this begs the question you know
is Intel goodness gonna again a fast
track ice Lake somehow for the desktop
side and that's what you're going to see
next after this after that whatever
initial launch of of coffee like stuff
they have going on right now kind of
seems like they might be rushing things
again kind of like how they did with
Scylla gex well I think that's a big
part of it is that Intel's whatever
roadmaps they had have been sort of
thrown into disarray by the need to
present a more competitive fronts to AMD
and answer back to AMD with a lot of the
stuff they've brought out on the
mainstream side its risin you know
reliably so and AMD for their part is
already talking about Zen to
Architecture the follow up architecture
to aim that Zen one what's which Verizon
is based on and they're talking about it
being able to hit much higher clock
speeds and also having better
instructions per clock performance so
that would be a pretty big jump and that
could close the gap in gaming
performance and various other things
like that so Intel definitely is in a
position where they need to bring suit
new products to market and I'm sure 2018
is gonna be a very interesting year for
that but it does seem overall with this
information like in in 2018 you're gonna
see eight core on the mainstream lineup
from firm Intel which which makes sense
to me right that's where the industry is
going so that'll stay competitive with
the rise and seven family but like I
said more of that when we get every cows
half of the show we're gonna we're gonna
wrap up my half with what we get some
some QA donation well people have
submitted donations to us and ask
questions we're gonna answer those
really quickly so starting off and takes
us to sell for collecting these from
wishbone with a $5 donation do you think
the Atari box concept is going to be a
ps4 Pro Xbox Scorpio contender or lack
in that area
I would say probably not it I think
Atari box is more of a retro device it's
made to play old-school games it's for
nostalgia so I don't think it's I don't
think it's competing necessarily with
the ps4 or Xbox Scorpio gonna go more on
in the same vein that Nintendo has I
think just sort of appealing more to the
mainstream family it's a nostalgic
device for people who don't know how how
emulators work yeah
Tom's brim Smith's 15 ox Norwegian krone
ax thank you Tom's Hagen is in every
week when well be mailtime and bacon or
beef jerky also Linus built an AMD 1920
X and video 1080p C adjusted for lulz
wait is that just for lols or is that
just for League of Legends and I don't
know the world may never know I haven't
watched many Linus videos this week so
I'm not positive about that video I need
to I need to check my Pio bucks I'll
probably do that later this week
yeah maybe and if you have a chance to
check yours you know it usually depends
on how much stuff we have rolling in so
yeah if we if we got stuff we'll collect
it so probably in the next week or two
we'll do another mail time and and catch
up on anyone who says but stuff we have
to answer his question bacon or beef
jerky oh I'm gonna say beef jerky I
that's yeah also because I can't imagine
receiving bacon in the mail I mean I the
other reason about mail mail delivery
bacon there'd be a little bit of both
probably beef jerky would make the most
to be the water active oh why not both
sent send one of us bacon yeah one of us

tonight thank you Tom Scott Dilbeck six
dollars in 66 cents will begin he's got
weekly contribution I bought a vibe what
do you guys recommend checking out ready
to see some Triple A titles I aspirating
my vibrance is set up again soon so soon
by next week cool nice any any big plans
- no I haven't I mean I want to yes I'm
planning to use it that's as far as I've
got okay
have you played any I have no I've came
three have not touched
in months and months so and it's it's
like weird are you playing the emerging
when you're doing the workout your vibe
workouts um I was playing hollow ball
which is a very simple game hollow point
totally unrelated which is also super
fun if you like archery the mechanics
work really nicely with the arrow and
the bow and stuff and then thrill of the
fight which is the most physically
demanding VR game I've ever played if
you are trying to like actually win and
you want to get into it
but as far as just like having fun let's
see what VR titles have we have we
played in the past I mean I really had a
lot of fun with space pirate trainer
that's but I know that one's yeah yeah
it's just just a console game to play
and I know there's so many other games
that have come out and that's the thing
is like nothing about able to bring it I
feel like when we first started playing
the our is when it kind of first came
out that's why all the games we need to
get it set up again when all the things
are sort of suit Indies semi aims become
semi unfinished and so much has happened
since that time so I feel like I'm
totally out of it I'm completely
irrelevant when it comes to what VR
games look like now I know if you're on
oculus if you're using an oculus rift
scott watson from AMD formerly of tech
report has just praised robo recall like
ten times over and he says it's a really
good game actually I was at the dentist
the other day and my dentist was like
God I know you're into tech I tried VR
for the first time my friend let me
tried this robot game and I was like was
it robo recall he's like yeah I was
amazing like I couldn't even kill the
robots because I was so overwhelmed by T
just like the environment and stuff I
was like a cool super hot super hot it's
supposed to be really good things God BR
stuff he instills $5.00 but you wish you
had the HD during scrapyard wars yeah
yeah yeah we could have used it having
12 terabytes
five minutes be 500 megabytes either way
no 500 gigs yeah we could have different
well hey thank you we will definitely
keep it up
Aaron borrow five bucks Thank You Aaron
thanks for the great entertainment and
information guys Cheers
Jesus you I'm gonna beer I'm Annie 99
five dollars hi guys Congrats Carl on
your increased Twitter fame oh I thank
you very much
can I use one g-sync and two non g-sync
144 hertz monitors for surround trying
not to sell a kidney
I'd yes that seems to me like one of
those like like like fringe features
that in video would be like yeah we
support that and like one of those
random things yeah yeah we said you
can't do that River I don't think so
exactly at least not while you're using
jisun yeah I don't think so either you
could probably do that and like play on
just a g-sync monitor with g-sync or
playing on the monitors without g-sync
right yeah maybe maybe traits waiting
just nvidia about that let's see if yeah
yeltsin could tell them to make it
happen already coolly 7 7 7 0 7 $10 good
show I don't know what it is with beer

I'm positive that was not my fault I
very clearly told him beard as I said
antenna I don't think it got into any of
the important parts of his left up there
but I mean wow I don't know that one
probably won't go quite as viral as less
probably not as last week's right
pushing it into my laptop I'm also my
supposed to clean this good Lord
I'm trying to do the the soaking method
because I don't know there no other than
here that top observes up oh yeah razors
are very absorbent as I found yeah there
that's good whew okay well hey now now
both of our sets for awesome hardware
have zero named beard yes it's their
worst things if it's okay
Thank You Aaron for your donation I mean
we're talking about cows
her fame yes yes very very famous now
there is your beer I can't help it now
I'm like now I've like succumbed to a
curse it's a live streaming curse right
I'll drink this really quick before I
spill it again yeah and we answered your
question cool thank you coolly 7 7 7 0 7
10 bucks good show good donation good
comment thank you thank you coolly
Oh Martin del $5 I sent you guys spicy
food hopefully you got it alright I
guess we really do need to check our pa
boxes yes I haven't been like a week or
two Omar I'm gonna check that out
I like spite a bit spicy I'm cool with
it if it's hot super hot super hot
Kyle will eat it Holt Hamlet $5 I've got
a lovely bunch of coconuts there they
are standing in the row small ones big
ones some the size of your head isn't
that a Lion King song a coconut if lead
II know that original song but yeah
that's a good selfie Liam what you over
from we attempted it yep Marsh mellow
$10 will you guys be doing Pet my PC
today no no no no next week
Kyle has all pimped out for this week I
am super kicked out
Brian Webb $5 I have three hundred and
fifty to four hundred dollars for a new
panel with my Anna Acer XG 2 7 0 hu 100
1440p 444 Hertz panels red bezels what
you recommend the 98 that that monitor
sounds pretty good that sounds good
that's a good one
that sounds right about where you should
be for 350 to 400 dollar range I don't
know what size that is I'm guessing
27-inch since it's got 2 7 in the title
but yeah how many 7 inches like I feel
like it's like the standard size that
standard size from you used to be like
21 22 inches and then it was like 24 27
that's like you can get 27 inch 1080 for
pretty cheap now yeah 27 inch 614 4844
Hertz
yeah that's pretty reasonable so a good
good luck to you Brian I think that's a
nice pair up with you 980ti as well
Jake 3d $5 just listen to last week's
show Kyle Walt Paul is Cal your L
illegitimate child do you have or want
more children Callie you and how they're
going to have kids
well that's Wow deep questions so many
deep questions in a row if if I'm gonna
have a kid that's probably gonna happen
in the next year or two so I'm sure I'll
tell you guys if that if that occurs kid
unboxing we want to kid into a full kid
review hey yeah like you know I've been
I've been having a kid but cardboard box
maybe like I've been I switched to
having kids you know like for I've tried
kid I've tried having a kid for 90 days
and then give your feedback on it or
like you know what's in the box
it's a kid pull you lie I'm just I'm
just spit ball I like all those yeah do
them all um Kyle you and Heather hmm
you have kids oh we already have two fur
babies Johnson super babies play enough
yep Anwar and I are Escobar's 2500 clips
hey guys there is yet a problem memories
kill between the aura software and
shreddin z RGB memories Strix x 370 - FM
transy RGB tears from today um that's a
good PSA those should work together
you've got a motherboard and memory that
should all sync synchronize RGB wise
make sure you update it to the latest
version of the extra 70 - FC UEFI bios
potentially reinstall or a software he's
asking I thought he was like telling us
there was might need to go so far is
clearing actually clearing your BIOS
settings and that kind of thing but
those should all synchronize up together
if they don't you got a problem I'm
sorry if I can't provide you more
troubleshooting info right here
as Jones $5 thoughts on the BS that is
the highly possible risk of Vega adding
board partners being delayed what do you
think about all that BS Paul I'm
thinking like the amount that I care for
a video card it's $200 overpriced is
very minimal and I feel like the amount
that you guys care for a video card
that's two or three hundred dollars
overpriced
it's minimal - so it becomes like
something that I don't consider
yeah like the existence of Vega 56 and
Vega 64 isn't gonna be viable to me
until I can say yes you at home can buy
one of these for the price that they're
being sold for so yeah I feel like if
that's the case if they're just okay
selling all their cards to to minors and
whatever then they're just kind of
taking themselves out of the
conversation when it comes to actual
gaming graphics cards yeah and I'll keep
recommending by a 1074 400 bucks yep
that's miles Bartley miles five Canadian
been watching for a while keep the fun
content coming what is the best tempered
glass water cooling case in your opinion
there's so many now yeah they're so
weird it's like any man any case any
case from last year that doesn't have a
version with a tempered glass side now
does I feel like all of these tempered
glass side panel case case manufacturers
with those products should owe me
royalties too somehow
but then I remember that in win know and
Lea and Lea Lea and Lea had tempered
glass that day long time ago
name one lien Lea case with a plastic
side panel window in the last five years
I don't know but the cases I remember
coming out like the D frame the in Wendy
frame was first one I remember like the
open air specialized tempered glass side
pet on it yeah yeah
yeah they're everywhere fantex Corsair
fragmental Coolermaster like look look
at the case features and then invited
they get the version with MPs CUDA $10
or work schedule has been weird so I
haven't caught you guys for a while and
Paul jiff is a tasty peanut butter but
I'm not sure what it has to do with
animated pictures on the Internet
oh yeah there's that whole debate that
should be a swordfight jiff or gift you
know I think I think it's been proven
that it's jiff though like officially I
don't know who's I was I was I was
convinced when I took a I went to Africa
on safari and I tried to take a bunch of
pictures of girl
boom contain headshot boom and find any
of those why don't you just ask my
friend Jeffrey who spells his name with
the G so your friend Jeffrey's probably
a hipster douche bag Kyle can za4 the
five dollars or 5/8 whatever a is hey
boys is there any big difference between
the horizon 1700 X 499 Austerlitz its
Australian and the 1,800 X 649 well if I
mama being that I overclocked probably
not at all go with the 1700 X save
yourself
150 150 Australian dollar Wow yeah save
yourself a hundred and fifty Australian
dollars you should be able to get the
1700 X to about four gigahertz overclock
it a bit they're all in that same range
like overall I do feel like the 1800 X's
from what turn the performance numbers
I've seen and maybe just ever so
slightly bins but it's it's so minimal
like it's not worth it at all to pay
that much more money so yeah 1700 X and
overclocked it and you're basically at
1800 X level for sure
indeed oh sorry $20 best day of the week
when this show is on earlier buy some
beer on me until I get the gritties
pumpkin ale set for Halloween
that's dad's Joe New York damn I think
he's gonna sound some beer we definitely

donate this we sell Heather is busting
heads and Chet wait she's a liar her
cell didn't donate but he just put his
comment on the donation comments how
dare he wait Wow he motivates Portuguese
donkeys awesome okay you talk about just
taking advantage of the authority that's
been granted to him I would say that's
okay it exists that's right Heather
thank you for for for moderating yes
you're killing honey um got any more
down here
one question however where the hell is
my freakin vrock premium key can't find
anywhere sell get this in for me please
I have no idea we we heard there was a
bunch of lucky not crazy about that and
Intel's gonna charge 500 bucks for it
I've heard nothing
so I don't know I think there's yeah
I've heard nothing about it I can't say
I've heard nothing so yeah I am you good
I hope they decide to make it like 20
bucks or something like that yeah charge
20 bucks for it Intel people won't be
able to complain they'll be like 20 okay
yeah exactly yeah Lebanon the Whale Ted
dollar is looking for a new ITX case for
hybrid GTX 1080i plus an r7 1700 fantex
evolve ITX tempered glass a shift or n
case m1 all will be AO cooled
traditional case versus unusual shift
case or mini case opinions I think with
your expected configuration the evolve I
TX will give you the best experience
because trying to fit that much hardware
with that much cooling and iOS all in a
mini case especially like you shift ran
in case you've worked for the ship
though I mean yes objet I think it's
more sustainable to only have one
radiator or one AO in the shift if you
get the shift X then you can definitely
do you can AO both your CPU and GPU has
a bit taller though yes it is it is but
it's still very compact like the
footprint is still about the same it's
very tiny footprint wise you just need
some vertical space but yeah I agree
with Paul the evolved ITX tempered glass
is probably your best bet if you if
you're looking for the smallest most
compact in terms of like leader volume
but really most a IO support in terms of
radiators and stuff
Frank Enzo $5 hey Paulie convinced me to
buy the ML 0 8 B for my open-air
graphics card by the way you scared me
last week don't ever show that much
emotion again I'm sorry
hey let your reaction what I'm saying
yeah I've never heard you I mean I've
heard you laugh pretty damn there's one
other time I heard you laugh really like
that really that hard but it only
happened it's an idea as a second time
in my life I've heard you laugh that
hard it's like the older you get the
more jaded you get great so it's harder
for you to really find something
genuinely funny
like that kind so when I saw that like I
knew I knew I was expecting to be like
oh whatever like blue whatever but like
it is I don't know in the eye and then
reaction good thing is idea yeah but
yeah I like it's watching that back and
laughing at it has like I don't know it
is so much joy it was spread yeah yeah
that's what makes me happy but indeed
Frank I'm glad you like the ml0
8b remember if you're doing heavy gaming
very effective to just pop off the top
side panel the desk filter on that to
just let the air flow outs and very much
consider can just doing something like
an active 120 millimeter slim fan or
something like that to draw air in
either on the lower one or the upper one
I think you'll get much better
temperatures that way but portability
wise and everything it's a nice little
case Oh Martindale five bucks it's 9:00
at million Scoville Paul and it's in
pounds P o box what I'm not touching
that what that attention n these are the
spicy snacks yes no help points as the
heat is the heat rating I'm gonna try it
that's a heat radio ministry I seen this
rating spicy spicy is flavored heat is
just hot for milder than that Niall is
for headon for masochists that's where i
nihilist he miss massive metal with I
don't even believe in spice so they're
all they're all good people but are not
eating metals $5 I need a current
Windows storage spaces review and please
do it with your 69 50 X system it's just
like mine thanks I can't promise that's
coming anytime soon bro I haven't really
used Windows storage spaces but um I
hope I hope you can find more
information on that soon I don't make
any promises I can't keep
thank you the nomination Matt bond $5
hey guys I'm going to start another
batch of homebrew and wanted to see if
you want me to send a growler
I love your shows and keep up the good
work absolutely we'll try it on stream
if that's cool with you have met free
beers or something that's appropriate
for like fall or winter yeah time frame
I like Oktoberfest
I like choosing the beers that like line
up the seasons it's nice you're you're
lame daj koji $5 Paul what are you going
to finish your damage CPC vlog
I just accidentally my leg hit the lever
on the chair and I just went down like
ten inches that must look really funny
um sorry about that
yeah what are you gonna finish your HTV
CC HC PC vlog he's got an i7 2600k HC PC
or should I just we're should I use it
to get my wife assimilated into the
master race
okay a good question I'm sorry it's
taking so long there's three different
factors contributing here one is that
the piece of wood that I got it has a
couple beetles in one corner of it and I
don't know how to get rid of him I've
just been waiting for them to die B yeah
beetles wood beetles they're supposed to
be killed because the piece of wood I
got was killed but there's just one part
of it where there's still some so they
must have gotten in there after it was
killed or something like that I'm not
sure so the beetles seem to die figuring
that out second thing is that I'm
getting a family's power supply and
actually enter Max's sending that over I
was trying to get the 650 watt fanless
version that they teased it a couple
events over the past two or three years
but they never actually brought that one
to market so I'm going with a 550 watt
famous which manufactures this any
maxima oh yeah
that's actually on its way right now
third thing I don't know if there's a
third thing third thing is that yet oh
I'm doing weird like I'm redoing the
electrical in our house and we might be
actually be doing some like
home-improvement stuff soon like
replacing the floors and this like
winding this the time with everything
else made me hesitate on it and stuff so
sorry umm so yeah sorry all of those
things have contributed to me taking a
lot longer to get that to get to next
step steps on that but it is still gonna
happen soon better camera following up
with you Karen bucks looking for a way
to operate two pcs using dual monitors
possible as single ultra wide using the
same peripherals any suggestions on
possible KVM is sufficient for gaming
and or alternative options
I do not use Nexus they just do a review
on no they they do an ad they do an ad
for a piece of software oh and I don't
remember what it's called starts with an
M synergy synergy no it doesn't
synergies yes
synergy Thank You Chet synergy we are
not affiliated with it all but hey if
you work for synergy maybe you should
come sponsors now since we're plugging
your product synergy is software you can
get works over your your home network
and you can use it to use a single
laptop keyboard or whatever to control
different computers around that so check
check out synergy yeah click the mode 20
bucks balls balls balls my thoughts
exactly yeah we don't care electronic
ttan but then there are his canadian
he's gonna it's canadian anyway he's
from canada yeah he has a right to say
he said lion lioness isn't a but he
is a whore it's a very subtle
distinction so deep so deep there it
goes okay punch $1 five bucks great show
guys building a new PC and want to
liquid cool but one us want to us men
mineral wanted use mineral oil and dual
pumps because of the oil is that
overkill are not worth it neither of us
have ever built
mineral oil cooled computers so we
probably can't give you a good advice on
this but I would say it's overkill for
whatever you're trying to do I think
that there are there are already enough
things products out there that you can
use without having to a mineral oil cool
your hardware that'll work just fine for
anything you want to do so the mineral
oil is just so you can say like look I
did this as it's super different it's
incredibly unique there's no other
system like it and I now have the
experience of doing a mineral oil cooled
system but as far as like Mississippi
goes I don't think it's necessary it's
probably okay but I think that concludes
your half of the show no it doesn't just
jazzy quickly good quick Lord quick
