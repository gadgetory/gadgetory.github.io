sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill oh we're cooler master yes we
are they have too much stuff here and
I'm not even including all this maker
stuff that they have give me a give me a
head scratch ball give me a head scram
get a little itchy
ah yeah good great see did your nails
get longer though okay no then my
manicurist it's amazing he is alright so
obviously there's two really cool things
that we both want to talk about here
there's the master concept too and
there's a really adorable cute little
hybrid cooler yeah so we both want to
talk about that but I think there's too
much for us to both cover otherwise so
how about this we'll split we'll split
it up I'm gonna handle the cases okay
I'll take the power supplies all right
I'll do the I'll do the coolers the fans
and perhaps some of the peripherals I
like the keyboards and stuff yeah nice
all right let's get it okay cool wait
first off Kristoff oh it's not this
little guy has something to say what do
you have to say little guy hey Wow his
words not that's uncalled for his words
why don't you uh want to get record when
you stop recording what why do you stop
recording with you
what's wrong what's going on Paul what's
wrong why can't you what happened
it's 2:00 and you no longer I got I did
it useless so we actually saw the master
concept last year in its version one but
I wasn't able to show anyone it was over
here under like a big sheet and they're
like hey look at this thing it's really
cool you can't show anyone that was mad
but this is actually well we can show
you at least the outside of the master
concept now the weird thing about this
is that you'll see this massive case
right here larger in fact than the
cosmos too and then if you see this case
over here which is quite a bit
diminutive those are both like the same
case they're not the same case but what
they're going for here is complete
modularity so again we can't show you
the inside there's still some like stuff
they're working on you know they don't
want any trade secrets leaking out but
you've got removable modular panels
right up here all the way across the top
if you open that up there's a
motherboard tray that's in there but it
can be shifted and moved around pretty
much wherever you want everything's on
Rails there were no rivets that I saw so
pretty much anything can just be shifted
and moved and put in different places or
you can sort of bring down the chassis
size down to something like this and
this is actually featuring a mini ITX
version of the motherboard tray that was
in there and they already even showed us
how these little pieces right here you
can just pop them off from one bring it
over and put it back on the other one
again guys this is just stuff they're
working on their ideas they've done a
lot with this I think since last year
and it still has a little bit of a ways
to go since obviously we can't show you
the insides but I think it's a pretty
interesting concept and for anyone who
likes cases that are the size of a small
car well this is probably to be the case
for you
moving on to cases you can actually buy
available in q3 is going to be the
mastercase pro 3 so they got three five
seven fives the one that's already out
fives
kind of a full size case this is a micro
ATX case this being the pro it's going
to be coming with a clear side panel
window of course and this one of course
is outfitted with an entire system
inside this is actually Dillon hose
mastercase pro 3 it's outfitted by him
it's got like
the Coolermaster little graphics card
support guy in there of course still got
the modular system for all the drive
trays that you can pop in there and it's
micro ATX I really like micro ITX as a
form factor it's not quite as
restricting as mini ITX gives you a
little bit more expand ability for
graphics cards so you can see they got a
2-way SLI configuration going on right
there
although there's no SLI bridges on there
he must be using that for GPU computer
something like that anyway the other
thing that's inside here that we already
kind of mentioned is this really
interesting little cooler it's actually
like a hybrid it's it's got liquid going
in there also a fan and it's all in this
one little unit so it's a 92 millimeter
fan at a very small 92 millimeter
radiator and look what was just handed
to me this is perfect so we were
actually pretty excited about this thing
so here you can see it in kind of a
vertical orientation the block or the
plate is down at the bottom just a
couple little tubes going up to the tiny
little radiator and if you want
something that's going to fit in a
smaller form factor case or if you just
don't want to like you know route a
bunch of stuff over to a big radiator or
that kind of thing it's going to be a
very interesting little product we were
surprised at this it doesn't have a name
yet though so if you guys think of a
cool name for this product leave that in
the comments section here's an exciting
case this is the pro 7 so actually no
I'm sorry this is the maker 7 remember
with Matt with Coolermaster they have
this new naming convention so you either
have like you know a master case or
whatever then you got the pro and you
got the maker makers at the top end so
this one is outfitted with a tempered
glass side panel here it's got a lower
chamber here for radiators it's got
plenty of room in their massive drive
support right here and it's even got a
removable panel up on top so you can
just pop that off if you want a little
bit less noise pop it on a little bit
more airflow you remove it just like
that of course it's got all the modular
features of the master series so it's
going to be compatible with all of the
accessories that are already for sale on
this coolermaster store CM store and
they're also starting to get those
accessories now to other retailers such
as Amazon and Newegg so we'll be seeing
those available so you have like you
know replaceable front panels and other
drive trays you can integrate there that
GPU support as well we do not have a
price point for the maker 7 but they're
planning to act
we launched it make it make it available
for sale CES in 2017 I've already seen
the odd-numbered mastercase series well
now we have the even-numbered mastercase
series so these are a little bit more
subdued as far as the maybe industrial
design goes but they're geared a little
bit more towards silence for one so this
one for instance has a little bit more
protective panels up in front perhaps
you know slightly more restricted
airflow but you got to balance that out
with the sound design still some gaps in
there in the front you can pop that
little panel up on top and you get your
connectivity for USB 2.0 USB 3.0 they
even have a USB type-c connector on
there which I love you get the clear
side panel there and then they've done a
unique thing here on the back as well
just trying to keep things nice and
clean especially maybe if you're in an
office environment or you just like to
have a clean workspace routing the
cabling out of the back of your case can
often be a challenge so they're working
with this mesh that they have here and
they actually showed us some of it like
that so it's basically flexible and you
can sort of pop little gaps in it to
route your cables through so you can rep
you know group them all up and rat them
out through a specific porch or that
kind of thing and obviously the
different versions of these might be
made in the pro or maker form but right
now we have the four right here and then
we have the slightly larger six Akula
master in many ways is all about design
and they wanted to go with the sort of
cleaner design for the master case
series but they also wanted to give
people a little bit more edge if that's
what you're into so they've decided that
when they add a tea on the end of a
product name it's going to be edgier
it's also going to have colors so
they're working on the color right now
they're they're going to develop a
specific color and they're going to
stick with it for this so they're going
with sort of a darker more subdued red
which actually has pretty cool look and
then if you compare this these two cases
side-by-side you can just see it's a
little bit more angled it's a little bit
more aggressive it's a little bit more
svelte back here has a sort of back and
it's got like a like a spoiler cat on
the back there a little bit and they've
also added a handle up on top which is
kind of a throwback to like the CM storm
striker for example which I really like
is it's really convenient to just be
able to pick up the case and move it
around but it also looks pretty cool so
there it is and let me know what you
guys think keys again this is still in
development if I'm not mistaken but and
do we have do we know when this might be
coming out
No all right we have no ETA on this but
I think it looks pretty cool let me know
what you guys think in the comments down
below I really cool on it wanted to show
you guys these frames of the cases
because they're sort of showing us how
as you go up and scale when it comes to
the different cases they're designing
you're basically getting more and more
options as far as modularity and sort of
re customizing your case to make it more
your own so this right here is sort of
the base frame for the master case then
you move it up to the master case maker
and then you move it up all the way to
the 7 right here which is basically just
a big aluminum frame which gives you
limitless possibilities now some CPU
heatsink fans right there but Kyle's
covering this of course well we'll let
him deal with that what I'm going to
talk about is these power supplies so
again we're looking at sort of a
unification of mashed cooler masters as
I keep saying master for cooler masters
naming conventions so master watt maker
master watt pro master watt and master
watt light so you'll notice no Pro pro
that's in the middle makers at the top
also they've added some light products
so this is going to be a little bit more
budget oriented so this power supply for
instance not any plus rated but it's
going to be very affordable
no modular cabling we got moving up to
the master watt this one is
significantly heavier it's got partial
modularity and it features 80 plus
bronze support or efficiency rating I
should say the master watt Pro gets a
little bit heavier gives you full
modularity these are only 150
millimeters long so keeping the distance
from the back of the case to where the
power supply ends weird way of saying
that but yeah
keeping it short means it especially in
smaller form factor cases you're going
to be able to fit these cooler master
has also now been using their own fans
across this entire series so that helps
them tune the fan speed a little bit
more keep a bit more consistency at the
top end we kind of teased this a little
bit at CES this year this is the master
watt maker and it's insanely heavy so
they have a they have the higher
amperage plugs on this one not only in
the plug in the back but also they've
custom design their own modular plugs
there so again providing a higher
amperage so if you're having possible
over voltage over current issues it's
either gonna be able to handle those of
course strip the protections that are
built into the power supply
this is a 1200 watt power supply this
one has two rails and it also features
digital support oh my gosh it's heavy
heavy is good in a power supply by the
way so they've also have an app right
here that you can use you can do
different configurations silence you can
do a gaming setting you can do an
overclock setting that will just wrap up
everything you know probably give you
max fan speed and you can even go in
there and dynamically set up a stepping
for the fan ramp speed so as the
temperature goes up the fan goes up more
so you can give yourself quieter
experience or a cooler experience it
even has a thing where you can plug in
how much money like your power costs in
your local area and it will tell you how
much money your computer is costing you
to run which that's pretty convenient
anyway guys that's all for the
Coolermaster booth I hope you've enjoyed
this stay tuned for more coverage from
company Tex 2016 and one last final
thanks to my sponsors fractal design MSI
