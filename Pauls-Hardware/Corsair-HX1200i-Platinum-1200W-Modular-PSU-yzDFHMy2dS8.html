covered a power supply so I wanted to
jump back into the game with something
big this is the coarser HX 1200 I a 1200
watt fully modular 80 + platinum rated
beast designed for a high-end gaming and
workstation desktops before I take this
out of the box and give the details or
any of that good stuff though who is
this power supply actually made for I
like to play this game with lots of
components as I think that for each
product that's brought to market there's
an absolutely ideal situation the right
to build for the right person - best to
make use of that product and give you or
that person at the best possible bang
for the buck okay so it's a 1200 watt
power supply and that makes the first
potential scenario pretty easy to
determine 3-way or four-way graphics
card configurations pretty much most
single GPU systems can get by with a 500
or maybe a 600 watt power supply so to
really use 1200 watts you need at least
three full-sized high-end graphics cards
if not for and of course it will vary
based on the GPUs and how much is
actually needed these setups are pretty
rare though so is this for anyone else
besides that Oh like a high-end
workstation for example might have dual
Zeon's and a Quadro GPU and then three
additional Tesla rendering accelerators
for example or maybe a full complement
of fire pro cards that could be a good
example - or maybe you're just an energy
efficiency fanatic and you really want
to be at the peak of that efficiency
curve this is an 80 plus Platinum rated
unit so you'll always get at least 89 to
90 percent efficiency but you can get
close to 93% efficiency if you're only
pulling about 600 watts are about 50% of
the hx1 1200 eyes available wattage and
maybe there's also a silent computing
aficionado out there who might note that
you can pull up to 480 watts from this
unit and the fan won't even need to spin
up as long as the temperature inside
stays lower than 25 C 480 watts is all
or more than what most gaming desktops
need and while there are other more
practical PSU is out there that offer
similar functionality most of them
couldn't also kick out 1200 watts if the
need were to arise so if you're one of
those people go ahead and hit that like
button because your PSU has arrived
you can still hang around and watch
though even if you're not one of those
people I won't tell
promised okay before I really move on
there's another question that's bound to
come up
that is why did Corsair make the HX 1200
I when they already have the ax 1200 I
which was launched last year well the ax
1200 I is a digital power supply and the
HX 1200 I is analog internally this
means apart from the HX 1200 I starting
at 270 dollars there's just the ax which
starts at 320 dollars that while this
unit is compatible with Corsair link you
won't have the same level of control as
you would with the digital version for
example the HX I will give you
monitoring for your 12 volt 5 volt and
3.3 volt rails but the ax I can actually
control those values the X I will also
provide readings for AC power input ATX
24 pin and 12 volt peripherals for
example essentially if adjusting any of
those settings within your power supply
is something that you have zero interest
in the HX 1200 I will provide a better
and more cost-effective option and
you'll still get all the same features
as far as power delivery efficiency and
build quality
moving right along with an unboxing
though you will note Corsair is
continued attention to detail when it
comes to packaging and accessories apart
from the PSU itself you get an
instruction booklet and warranty
information there is a seven year
warranty on the HX 1200 I very nice a
very appropriate powered by Corsair case
badge as well as eight or ten zip ties
and for black mounting screws as well as
a thick 14 gauge AC power cable and do
keep this cable with this PSU as using a
thinner gauge cable can lead to melting
and even potentially fires in the wrong
situation and that's bad a suggestion
for the future though friends at
Coursera I've seen 24 pin at jumper caps
and included with power supplies lately
that allows you to power it on without
connecting it up to a full system and I
really think that that would round out
the accessories for a high-end PSU like
the HX 1,200 I the PSU itself comes in a
faux velvet bag which you'll desperately
search for use for after installation is
complete and the modular cables oh dear
God the modular cables there are just
way too many of them so let's go ahead
and sort that out shall we okay there's
two eight pin EPS supplemental CPU power
cables for dual CPU or high-end
overclocking boards of course the main
24 pin motherboard connector four of
those peg or PCI Express graphics power
cables
each of them has two six plus two pin
plugs giving you up to eight eight pin
PEG connectors total for 4-way GPU
configurations for peripherals you have
four SATA power cables each with four
SATA plugs for 16 toll as well as three
molex power cables each with four plugs
as well for 12 total finally there's a
couple molex to floppy plug adapters and
a couple cables for connecting your PSU
to the rest of your system to enable
Corsair link also did you notice how non
colorful these cables are their flats
they are all black all the way down to
the plugs and outside of customs leaving
jobs I think they're ideal for looks and
stealthy cable management physically
this is a large power supply at seven
point eight seven inches or 200
millimeters long this could cause some
space conflicts in smaller cases so bear
that in mind on the top or the bottom
depending on how its oriented I guess
there's 140 millimeter fluid dynamic
bearing fan which again does nothing
unless the power supply is actually
drawing 500 watts or the temps go above
25 degrees Celsius besides that it won't
spin and it will make zero noise at that
point it will spin up on a fan curve
that's optimized for low noise so even
if it's spinning you probably won't even
really notice it on the back there's
some hex grilling for ventilation your
AC cable plug and a very beefy on/off
switch each side has the Corsair logo
with the HX 1200 i model name and some
blue color accents and it's oriented so
the text should be right-side up unless
you're using a case with the flipped
design of course on the top is your
power chart and here's another point I
have not yet mentioned this power supply
delivers all 1200 watts of its rated
power via one single massive 100 amp 12
volt rail I haven't tested personally
but according to these numbers you
should be able to power to AMD r9 295x2
s off of this single rail that is quite
impressive finally there is the business
end with all of the modular cable
connection points all laid out with
labeling so you can tell what's what and
on the left side there's also the
Corsair link stuff so a couple plugs for
those depending on which of the cables
you're going to use and also a fan test
button which surprisingly enough tests
the fan it works too I tried it last
thing I would usually like to address
for a PSU would be internal component
choice and build
but this power supply really is
brand-new and there's just no good load
test reviews out yet from folks like
Johnny guru techpowerup Tom's hardware
or PC perspective for me to lean on so I
will say this the history of reviews for
other models in the HX wattage I series
have been spectacular with no issues
with internals or build quality Corsair
also states that this unit uses all
Japanese capacitors rated at 105 C and
they do continuous testing server grade
testing mind you at 50 C for this unit
so that's what it's validated at we can
also reasonably reasonably assume that
you can't really qualify for 80-plus
platinum rating without using some
quality parts inside so with all that
said what do you guys think of the HX
1200 I is 1200 watts too much for you or
are you happy to have a high-quality
slash lower cost option versus the bells
and whistles Laden ax series let me know
