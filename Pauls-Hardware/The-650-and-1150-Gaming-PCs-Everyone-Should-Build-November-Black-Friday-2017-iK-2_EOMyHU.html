hey what's up guys and welcome back to
Pauls hardware this is my monthly builds
video it is November as you can maybe
tell and today's monthly builds video is
going to be a little bit different than
my usual monthly builds video for one
main thing I've actually already built
my monthly build for this month that's
right here that is a about a 1700 ish
dollar all AMD build in the new NZ xdh
400 I and I just posted that video
yesterday so check it out as well as
checking out my builds playlist where
you can find all of the builds I have
done as for today I'm gonna be going
over some parts lists so a quick glance
at the parts list for this build and
then I have two other parts lists that I
have put together based on your feedback
from last month so the question was what
builds you want to see this month the
answer by about 30% of you was the best
gaming PC for 800 dollars now what I've
done is I've made two gaming pcs that
are $650 and about eleven hundred fifty
dollars and I'm going to talk more
theoretically about choosing the parts
that go into a build the general price
expectations that you should have and
especially since it's about a week until
Black Friday right now how you should
sort of go and go about your thought
process when you're choosing parts to
put into a new system that you're
building right now and also sort of a
challenge because I'm gonna show you
guys the prices I'm looking at and I
have just last night and this morning
put together builds that I think are
kind of the best bang for your buck at
different price points and let me know
if you guys over the next week or so can
find some Screaming deals with the Black
Friday stuff going on and perhaps get
these builds or equivalent of these
builds for much less money I think
that's very very possible so of course
we're gonna start off with that NZXT
h100 i built and then we have the 1151
$1,150 price points and then we also
have the $650 price point and these are
actually tied very closely together
so first off the H 400 I build and this
is already assembled I'm gonna be
testing this this will run you about
1700 ish dollars depending on how you
buy stuff and where you buy it it's got
an r7 1700 CPU in it which is an 8 core
16 thread processor you can get for less
than $300 285 on Amazon right
the Rev of two of the NZXT crack in X 62
which is a 280 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler the Rev 2 version does
have support for the m4 sockets so you
get a bracket in there that is
compatible and that was definitely nice
to have motherboard was only a
seventy-five dollars and this is
probably if anything the weak points in
the build not that it's a bad
motherboard or anything it's got a very
nice set of features but it's only a $75
motherboard so when you're looking at an
upgrade path you're probably not gonna
have the greatest of power delivery on
this motherboard although you do have to
m dot two slots which is part of the
reason why I chose it
as well as four dimm slots for ddr4 2 m
dot 2 slots is actually really hard to
find down in the budget B 350 range but
asrock has several motherboards that
have that which I thought was nice my
memory is a big challenge right now
because it is very overpriced and I
ended up going with a corsair dominator
platinum kit for this build and that was
because the memory that I had on hand
actually wasn't working it wasn't
compatible immediately upon installation
so definitely a recommendation to
double-check call the qvl lists the
memory lists that motherboard
manufacturers put out to double-check
that the memory that you're purchasing
will be compatible with the motherboard
and processor that you choose you can
also check AMD's lists for that as well
because they have some lists available
on their websites so I'm with the
corsair dominator platinum there are
cheaper 16 gig Kix kits out there but
this one looks pretty nice and and I had
it so there we go
so shiva has a new series of SSDs their
budget oriented that they're called a TR
200 so I had afford an 80 gig version of
that that they sent over so I dropped
that in there available 240 480 and 960
gig capacities and a 240 at least right
now is gonna run you about $90 and I
haven't found a price for the 480 but it
should be roughly twice that moving over
to the big-ticket item and the reason
why I chose to do an all AMD build was
because Vega 56 was actually selling for
kind of close to the retail price
so I actually set up a filter which you
can use on PC part picker to just choose
for instance a specific type of GPU and
see what's available until 2 just choose
the lowest price version gigabyte has
one for $465 right now guys last week
you could find a Vega 60
fifty six four four hundred and if not
four hundred dollars a four hundred
twenty dollars which is still 20 bucks
more than the MSRP I do not recommend
buying a Vega 56 at 460 470 dollars at
400 to 420 there's an argument to be
made that it is powerful enough to be
competitive with the gtx 1070 and even
more so if you are planning to buy a
freesync monitor at the same time
because those pair well together but
when you're looking at these expensive
prices due to cryptocurrency mining it
just doesn't it's not practical to buy
that for gaming so for that reason the
builds we're going to talk about next
I have mainly chosen Nvidia cards
because the AMD cards just can't seem to
keep their prices down moving on though
the NZXT th400 i new case from NZXT it's
a micro ATX case and that's actually why
I had a little bit of a difficult time
finding a proper motherboard for this
case but it's $150 definitely a premium
a high-end case but it does have a very
nice set of features and definitely
check out that video if you want to see
me assembling all this stuff in there
coolermaster 650 watt 80 plus gold power
supply about 95 bucks and then three
NZXT err RGB fans 9zx eq+ LED controller
and an NZXT internal USB hub rounding
things out so is able to plug in all the
fans and use the NZXT cam software to
control my lighting and make it kind of
fancy and do the marquee effects and
stuff so we'll be following up with a
test video on this system do some more
lighting effects and of course see how
the performance is since it is the first
all AMD system I've built in quite some
time let's move on to our next builds
and these shouldn't hopefully be a
little bit more practical and a little
bit more helpful for you guys I want to
address one thing right from the get-go
and that is Intel Intel has launched
coffee Lake just recently it's LGA 1151
but it uses newer chipsets z 370 is the
chipset that's available on motherboards
right now for it however those
motherboards tend to be a little bit
more expensive there are some budget
options in there but the reason I'm not
choosing any coffee like s CPUs or
motherboards for these next couple
builds that I'm going to show you guys
is because of this here's the 8400 which
is a 6 core 6 thread CPU and it's pretty
fairly reasonably priced $199 just not
there it's not in stock
by it so y-you can't recommend the CPU
you can't buy the 8600 k forces you to
pay just the low low price of 100 extra
dollars for the privilege of having your
six core CPU unlocked so you can
overclock it which i think is pretty
absurd so I don't recommend that right
now 300 bucks it's just a crazy market
for that finally I have the 8700 case
still selling for forty to fifty dollars
more than what insult sold us the MSRP
was and doesn't matter anyway because
it's still a lot of stock so for that
reason my next two bills are gonna be am
beat AMD based AMD based because there's
very viable entry-level quad core
options for them there's very viable
upgrade path on a m4 going from quad
core with four threads all the way up to
eight cores and 16 threads and AMD has
promised that am four will be a main
stream platform socket for in the next
couple years at least we're looking at
lifespan through 2020 so there's a
fairly reasonable expectation that come
the next year or so as AMD is working on
Zen to stuff which is still in the rumor
phase right now you might get a CPU in
the future that could drop into this so
all that said here is the $650 budget
gaming PC we got the quad core we got a
b3 15 motherboard for 85 bucks we got
eight gigs of memory an SSD a GTX 1063
gig and then I reasonably priced case
and power supply now I made a quick pie
chart because pie charts are so fun just
listing the various components here the
seven main components CPU motherboard
memory storage video card case and power
supply the price of each one with the
six hundred and fifty dollar builds and
then the price of each one with the one
thousand one hundred and fifty dollar
builds so you can look relative to the
other parts in the system how much is
being spent on each component the video
card in both systems is going to be the
most expensive part at about a hundred
and ninety dollars that's about twenty
nine percent of the cost of the $650
builds CPU and cooler is next at a
hundred dollars fifteen point two
percent of the cost and then beyond that
you're gonna have memory of course since
memory is still pretty expensive sixteen
point seven percent of the cost at one
hundred and ten dollars after that you
have motherboard with eighty-five
dollarz 12.9% storage with $79 12% and
then power supply and case both coming
in about seven to seven and a half
percent at forty five and fifty dollars
each the system went to sleep over here
so it got a little bit quieter alright
looking at the eleven fifty dollar bill
to break down here we can see the video
card becomes a larger chunk at four
hundred bucks
33.7% CPU cooler and CPU and cooler $195
16.4% s-- memory 14.3% storage eleven
point eight motherboard eleven point Oh
so again just just sort of keep in mind
these general comparisons when it comes
to how much percentage of the total cost
of prism you might be spending on each
part bear in mind it can fluctuate a
bits when you're looking at different
price points and especially if you're
looking at kind of the bare entry-level
$650 versus something a bit more
full-featured at eleven fifty and I will
go down the comparisons between these
two builds as I get to the next one so
our CPU for the 650 build is the risin
312 hundred and quad core is now budget
two guys keep that in your heads now
quad core is budget quad core hyper
threading is clawing its way up out of
budget six core is more mainstream but a
quad core will fully get you by and it's
really nice you can get a decent quad
core from AMD on their current gen
platform for $100 and you got to pair
that with a motherboard of percept rosen
and gigabytes a be 350 gaming three and
also as I'm also showing you guys here a
big way to get a little bit of extra
bang for your buck in general and of
course in the holiday season as well is
mail and rebates I generally don't
include include those in the overall
cost of the system but this motherboard
at 85 dollars also as a $15 mil and
rebate from Newegg which means that you
can get it for as cheap as $70 if you
count mail and rebates of course the
things I'm looking for in a be 350
motherboard are going to be four dimm
slots so you have plenty of space for
memory I'd like to see some kind of
cooling going on on
power delivery and I mean you can take a
closer look at those power delivery
phases yourself maybe in a review on the
specific motherboard I'm not going to go
into that now but good to have if you're
planning on doing a bit of overclocking
and then of course you want at least a
few full-size PCI Express slots so you
can have some expansion options down
there and then beyond that you have at
least one m2 slot and this gigabyte
board they've positioned it right below
the graphics card slot which isn't the
best position but at least it is there
for expansion beyond that you're usually
going to have roughly the same
configuration otherwise when it comes to
SATA connectivity as well as IO on the
back for memory my main yeah my main
goal said it's just compatible it just
works and is compatible so the Corsair
Vengeance lpx kits the 3000 speed is
very compatible with AMD this kit has
worked in every single AMD testbed I've
said it I plugged it into you can run it
at the 29:33 divider easily just by
setting the XMP settings and it is 10 or
20 bucks more than other comparable 8
gig 2 by 4 gig kits right now but paying
a little bit more for the peace of mind
compatibility is worth it when it comes
to storage you're gonna want an SSD
that's just I don't recommend getting a
cheapo hard drive to install into you're
putting your operating system on this
windows probably Windows 10 3 4 min ago
to the future is just kind of a pain in
the butt so for entry-level 240 gig 250
gig is is the SSD that you're going to
want to go for those will cost you about
79 to 80 dollars right now sorting by
price in this capacity range they do
start to ramp up pretty quickly but
generally speaking a standard SATA SSD
all of the new ones are relatively
comparable to each other so double check
a review of course this SanDisk SSD plus
version as well as the SK Hynix that are
both down here in the $80.00 range are
both totally fine for you and the next
of course you want that graphics card in
this parametric filter I have actually
included both three gig and 6 gig
graphics cards so sorted by price you
can get a GTX 1063 gig for a hundred and
ninety dollars which is you know right
about where it should be and then if you
do want to jump up to six gig the
cheapest is two hundred and sixty
dollars so that is a good $70 in
but you will get some benefit from the
six gigs so if you're wanting to invest
a little bit more money on this build I
would say upgrading the graphics card
would be a good place to start
there is the GTX 1060 that I have chosen
it's the small one but it is of course
reasonably priced finally for case and
power supply you should be able to get a
very solid decently appointed case such
as the cooler master master box five
it's got a clear side panel windows so
you can look in at your build it's got a
painted black interior it's a solidly
built case with good construction good
cable management routing options you
know there are some benefits and
features that you don't get with a $50
case but this is what you should be
looking for this is totally gonna get
you by I've worked with this case and
it's totally fine and again a $10
million rebate will get for 40 bucks
which is pretty nice
finally power supply 80 plus bronze is
what you'd want and 550 watts you can
get away with 500 I like getting a
little bit more Headroom on my power
supply but you should be able to get
something like this from a reputable
manufacturer like Corsair EVGA for about
forty to forty five dollars and again
man those mail-in rebates right now $20
mil rebates so anyway you can get this
as cheap as 25 bucks right now and
that's the rundown of my six hundred and
fifty dollar budget gaming PC so just to
reiterate what I'm going for here is the
basic quad core from the AMD Rison
platform I'm going for a be 350
motherboard with those specs I was
looking for I'm going for an 8 gig 2x4
geek kit that I know is compatible its
rise in with the speed of 3000 or better
I'm going for a 240 or 250 gig SSD
a GTX 1063 gig for as cheap as possible
a $50 case with good appointments and
features and you know take your pick of
which one you think looks best and then
a solid 80 plus bronze rated 550 watt
power supply 658 72 if you get these
from all the least expensive places and
then again as I showed you guys lots of
mail and rebates going on right now so
take advantage of those if you want to
jump you back to my comparison here and
I want to point out so the differences
in price so going from a hundred to two
hundred dollars on the 1150 bills we're
jumping from a quad-core with four
threads to a six core 12 thread so we're
tripling our number
threads available for a little less than
double the price and I'd say that's a
nice jump up for the motherboard we're
going full-size ATX and I've gone with
the X 370 chipset you can still get away
with a be 350 chipset motherboard for
this build and you can save a little bit
of money that way the X 370 chipsets
motherboards though tend to be a little
bit they intend to be built a little bit
better with a little bit better power
delivery so potentially better
overclocking and maybe some better
features more on that in just a second
from memory I've jumped from 2 by 4 gigs
to 2 by 8 gigs and it's not quite double
in price about $60 more so you're
getting more gigs per dollar if you can
afford to go with the 2 by 8 gig kit for
storage I'm going from 240 to 480 double
the storage less than double the price
for the video card we're going from a
1063 gig all the way up to a gtx 1070
full-fat 8 gig and that is a very nice
upgrade and GPU performance case we're
just increasing the price by about 30
bucks for a nicer case with some better
features and the power supply again just
jumping up by about 25 ish dollars to
get ourselves an 80 plus gold rated unit
so here is what those price increases
have gotten us and total price listed
here with all of the cheapest prices
from PC park Pickers 1180 328 again big
jump in CPU core processing performance
going up to that 6 core and AMD is nice
enough to give you simultaneous
multi-threading on there 6 core Rison 5
processors so you get 6 cores and 12
threads for the low low price of just
under $200 overclockable comes with a
very decent CPU cooler in the box so I
really like that for value there isin 5
1604 motherboard we have the x3 70
gaming X this is another asrock
motherboard and I chose this one mainly
because it's got a pretty decent sale
going on for about a hundred and thirty
dollars from super Beezus you can also
get it for about that same price from
Newaygo but that's using a mail-in
rebates and this motherboard got some
very positive reviews you can see from
the reviews here on Newegg it's got some
pretty a pretty decently upgraded power
delivery configuration it's a 12 phase
power delivery set granted the phases
aren't everything
this is definitely built a lot better
than a lot of those be 350 boards I was
looking for beyond that looking for the
same specs four dimm slots of course
nice to have a little bit RGB lighting
not of course a key selling point but
hey it's there and then here since we
are upgrading the board and spending a
bit more money we've got some other
features such as a couple RGB headers on
there but more functionally speaking to
MDOT two slots on this board one down
here one up here also X 370 will allow
you to do two-way GPU configurations
that's again not very practical but it
is it is there now for the memory again
just doubled the capacity so went from a
2 by 8 gig or two by four gig kit to 2
by 8 gigs so you can again get by with 2
by 4 gigs with this same build so the
idea with me going with the 650 build in
the 1150 build if I didn't make this
clear enough was take anything from the
650 build and kind of swap in stuff from
the more expensive build and you can
kind of get yourself into the middle
there with whatever parts you might
think are more important to you than
others but I did the cert by price here
with the parametric filter again Corsair
kits that are dee-dee-dee-dee are 3000
3200 and you can get you can save 15 or
20 bucks by going with the the blue kit
and you know maybe just paint it or
something like that it's the same memory
inside it's just blue anyway that fit
figure that out whether or not you care
about aesthetics or not again the same
parametric filter here for the SSD just
I'm looking for 300 to 600 gig range
rather than the down in the 250 gig
range and here we can see the prices are
much more reasonable with SSDs this
capacity when you're comparing its of
spending say 90 bucks on a 240 gig it's
not that much to upgrade to this if you
sort by price per gigabyte right over
here you can actually see where you get
the best deal so the W the Western
Digital 500 gig SSD is a great deal
right now for 140 bucks maybe consider
that one and then of course video card
we wanted a gtx 1070 we want the
cheapest gtx 1070 you got a ZOTAC and a
gigabyte both mini versions available
down here and then maybe consider some
of these other options if you want to
spend a little bit more money if you
want to a beefier cooler or something
like that but don't spend too much more
even the mini versions you can still
overclock and
there's not really a whole lot of
variance between the max speed you can
get case of course we gotta have a case
in power spot I think 80 dollars is a
good budget for a case in this range and
for 80 bucks
I think the fantex P 400 is a fine
option again you got some RGB lighting
options that are in there solid builds
I got tempered glass USB 3.0 so a lot of
those kind of blingy nice features and a
case I've worked with and is super easy
to build in a good case by fantex
there's other $80 case options there too
as long as they're full-size ATX then
you know choose whatever one you think
looks prettiest finally we are paying
another $20 for a more premium power
supply 80 plus gold rated rather than
bronze means we'll have a little bit
cheaper power bill with this power
supply and 650 watt gives us a little
bit more Headroom for upgrade options in
the future whether you're talking about
adding drives or adding I guess mainly
adding drives or upgrading to possibly a
more power hungry graphics card and
those are my builds for November 2017 I
hope you guys have learned a little bit
about choosing the parts for your system
because I know it can be a challenging
process especially now that there's
mainstream and enthusiasts on the Intel
and AMD sides there's just so many
choices around right now but guys if any
of you use this as a template to build
yourselves a new PC this holiday season
I would love to hear about that in the
comment section down below I don't have
a feedback straw poll for this month
because I think what I'm gonna do for
next month towards the beginning of
December is kind of do the same the same
MO that I did right now give you guys
sort of general guidelines for parting
on a system but we'll do it after Black
Friday rather than before anyway thank
you guys so much for watching this video
hit the thumbs up button if you did
enjoy it and we'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
