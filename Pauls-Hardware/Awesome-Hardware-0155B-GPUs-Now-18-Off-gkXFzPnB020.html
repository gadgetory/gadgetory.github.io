many clickbait titles that have done
phenomenally well in the vlog department
so I don't know if that's it
you got space about them there's old
there's a cool-down on the click beep
that's my click beep oh I have more than
well exhausted the cooldown I don't know
you know any rate here's the way I look
at it
hi everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware but here's the way I look at it
right I used to work at Angel Stadium
here in Southern California I was a
Hawker I would go and have peanuts or
ice cream or cotton candy or other stuff
and I walk up and down the aisles and
yell stuff and sell stuff hey
Angel Stadium I think the capacity at
Angel Stadium is like 24,000 sure
something like that so that's my mental
image of like the nun I'm gonna be
people who might be member of views on a
video sure something if I make a video
and a stadiums worth of people viewed it
I mean granted it's all relative and
everything no sure but sure like I still
got to be happy about that true so I
need I didn't think more like you yeah
yes
yeah pretty impressive although right
you're right although YouTube hates us
and their net yeah they're not pushing
our big arrows they're not pushing our
vids at all like YouTube wants us to die
after all we've done for you YouTube
why aren't you pushing notifications to
my subscribers who have clicked the bell
even and why aren't you gonna aren't you
like promoting both of our videos in the
sidebar or in the search videos I just
don't know why you're trying to kill us
it's so much effort we do we care
speaking of putting effort let's get
back to what I said a few minutes ago
which is hello everyone and welcome to
awesome hard work if this is your first
time ever watching the show it's
probably a bad introduction because
we've already drank a few beers and
we're just gonna kind of aimlessly
mishmash our way through the rest of the
show for now but I'm gonna kool-aid it I
can I can at least give you guys a quick
explanation of what the heck is going on
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. to
cific time kyle and i stream a live show
and we discuss technology we talk about
computers and everything we do for about
two hours the first hour is streamed to
one of our channels in the second hour
stream to another of our channels so on
this week's episode 155 we stream
through the first half site a - Kyle's
channel that's linked in the description
if you want to check it out we're now on
decide B
and that that pretty much that's that
pretty much sums it up again we we we do
just a smidge of drinking we
occasionally use adult language so that
this is a show intended for adults so
please hide your wife hide your kids you
know if they're offended by adult
language and feel free to join us in
drinking alcohol if you are of age and
please drink responsibly and all that
good stuff also at the beginning of the
show we typically like to point out that
we sell stuff and if you like our
content that we produce on youtube or on
Twitch because we are also streaming to
twitch TV slash outs of mark where hates
which check out our stores pulsar
Burnett is my store look at all these
awesome things that you can purchase
anyway it's all real hike ball
high-quality and it's a great way to
support us you can also buy stuff from
Kyle's store that is big weight dot tex
slash store did i say my store paul's
hardware that met that is my store bit
with that text i stores cal store and
you can buy stuff there too word will
yell johnson series you've mugs plant
classes hoodies it's all good and if you
happen to buy stuff during the show at
the end of the at the end of the show
we'll we'll go through those and we'll
shout your name out and we'll thank you
we sure will also yo Johnson
and it's a great tradition all right
let's get back into the the meat as in
were meat of of the stuff we're gonna
discuss today back into the tech news
favorite part of the show the meat yes
indeed tech news tech news met to
clearly indicate that and by the lower
thirds otherwise people get confused
starting off with Nvidia and AMD
graphics cards prices continuing to drop
this is good news this is absolutely
fantastic news I am I'm excited about
this because again there's been a lot of
like good news and good stuff to talk
about in the tech world over the past
year too especially with AMD kind of
coming back with Rison and they're just
being a little bit more choice more
options more come more competitiveness I
would say you know in the desktop space
especially if you're building your own
computer but it's been stymied so much
some somewhat by high graphics card
prices and time memory prices my memory
is still pretty expensive but it's come
down somewhat but graphics cards the
story is is a little bit better
so there are currently several things
affecting the graphics card pricing
rumors of next-gen and video graphics
Kurt's rumors of next-gen AMD graphics
cards although whether or not they re
badges of Polaris variants we're still
not sure about that also cryptocurrency
mining which has been a great
contributor to high graphics card prices
demand for that use case has somewhat
dwindled again for various reasons but
all that has caused prices to drop
pretty significantly back in March
timeframe they dropped by about 25
percent across the board but that was
really dropping them from like
ridiculously overpriced like you know
just somebody with thousand-dollar 1080
T eyes and $400 the RX 5 80s right to
like just a little overpriced and it's
like oh I can buy a graphics card for
like 20 or 40 bucks
over what it originally listed forward
right two years ago when it launched all
not ideal felt better but
this lighthouse it's still not ideal
this is a furtherance of that and the
article from WCC F Tech that were
referencing here specifically talks
about the European market but that does
seem to be affecting US prices - yeah
according to the article this is a trend
that's likely likely to continue well
into the end of the summer and the
back-to-school season as NVIDIA prepares
to introduce its new family of gaming
GeForce graphics cards and talk of AMD
doing the same before the year's end on
the Radeon site so here's a quick
rundown of the prices at the end of May
again there was a drop in March there
was a month or two or so of kind of
stagnation at those prices and then from
the end of May up until now which is a
month and a half two months sure prices
have dropped by as much as 18% some
somewhere in the eight to fifteen
percent range for other cards listed
here 1070 1080 RX Vega 56 and 64 unit
this is the first time I like this is
legitimately the first time I've like
been like maybe a Vega 56 might be
something I can sell people maybe you
could buy like it's never that's never
been the case yeah I have never told
anyone by Maya Vega at 56 or Vega 64 and
put it in their system right like it's a
perfectly adequate card but not for 600
bucks exactly for a vague if 1070 was
much more reasonably priced I'll say oh
yeah so that's kind of cool and just
just to reality check it right now I
thought we would quickly jump over its
new egg
and look at their video cards and video
devices and desktop graphics cards and
just do what we've done on the show
before a time or two which is kind of
give a real-time check of pricing let's
start with the RX 580 ever popular we
only want to look at new egg prices and
I want to say eight gigs yeah eight gig
card all right
lowest price please yes all right
260 and that's out of stock so that's
not super exciting this is a little race
for a little bit more yeah maybe people
got too excited obviously let's try the
the Radeon I'm sorry the Nvidia set GTX
1078 gig 400 it's still out of stock
this is man this is the m8 is this the
Amazon alright so the cheapest is for
$17.99 for this little gigabyte mini one
there's a core by nine for nine 49th
there although the main details oh you
can't have it all right
sorry yeah I got ya I said those view
details ones where right so you can get
a ZOTAC 1070 Mini for 400 at to Kirk
alright and that's and that's not even
like there mineus tough car it's like it
still has a dual fan design it's a tough
so yeah so that's that's about
reasonable so good to hear and it's been
so long since I've cheated 1070 for 399
yeah it's been months I mean considering
a few years ago remember our big
complaints in the first two three months
after launch was that they were like
alright 50 bucks over and over was it to
79 to 80 I'm sorry 379 to 389 yeah they
originally announced MSRP for the 1070
that it never sold for right
it's never been they've never been in
this RP MSRP is a is a myth it's a
mythical creature
all right trying to get it's a rare
Pokemon will never catch
move it along though netflix investors
are apparently a little bit worried
about Netflix because it's it's grown to
this the maximum size apparently this is
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings looking very
skeptical extremely skeptical so Netflix
missed its subscriber growth targets by
about a million subscribers in the three
months ending in June otherwise known as
q2 April May June
there is concern from investors that
this might be due to a saturation limit
for the streaming platform wait simply
put Netflix has 130 million subscribers
and maybe that's the most it's ever
gonna get or just that that's the
saturation point where there are as many
people subscribing to Netflix as can
reasonably do so based on their their
income and
spending capacity and that kind of thing
right
based on this news this unfortunate news
about the missing their growth targets
their stock price fell fourteen percent
in case you're wondering specifically
what the growth target is they projected
6.2 million more subscribers in this
three-month period and they only only
got 5.2 million and now investors are
freaking boldly at 5.2 million
subscribers and three months high Wow I
mean I would be very disappointed with
that if our YouTube channel
yes our investors are very disappointed
in us obviously in the reflux at
different stan has different standards
and when you're looking at the corporate
world's constant growth is is often
importance ends I'm not gonna negate the
you know how that actually affects a
business especially something that
something like something like Netflix
but
it still seems like they got lots of
subscribers in there still very
successful so yeah I don't know maybe
this maybe the stock goes overinflated
they've got some competition coming
their way though yes with each of you
stepping up their Guinea Disney Disney's
gonna be launching their own streaming
service Apple and Disney both land in
the future right
those are anticipated to be huge
competitors for streaming services that
are already existing such as Netflix
right HBO has a very popular streaming
platform and they have proven that you
can take a relatively small number of
shows that are with the focus on quality
and it can draw in subscribers with that
model oh yeah I mean I think of Game of
Thrones
yes Game of Thrones when people are
subscribed to HBO just for that show
mostly also West world what's world oh
yeah I forgot West bolds HBO - it's
pretty I'll say - shows but still
yeah still waiting on the alt shift X
video for the final two episodes of
Westeros but I get distracted once again
the landscape is increasingly looking
more like an unbundled version of the
old cable model when you look at how
people pay for their entertainment right
dozens of channels from Netflix to CBS
to Showtime
each with their own monthly fee yeah
this is actually a model that I'm
personally okay with because one of the
things that if you look at the cable
subscription subscription model of the
past is like oh you're gonna get this
package for a hundred and twenty bucks a
month
one hundred and sixty bucks or month or
something and you're gonna get two
thousand five hundred channels and
they're all bundled in with this and
this and this but it's like I'd rather
pay for what I know I'm gonna watch so
exactly that's why an ad hoc direct
subscription to HBO for HBO go has made
sense for a lot of people because
exactly I know I'm gonna watch those
shows I can directly see the money I
spend on that being brought back to me
by the value I get from from watching
that and it's worth then it's worth the
money
yeah so
this is why the next story we're going
to talk about in a second about net
neutrality sort of feeds back into this
which is that like I'm perfectly happy
paying a base fee for a solid broadband
internet connection which in my humble
opinion should be around forty bucks a
month forty fifty bucks a months if it's
not about to be bundled with anything
yeah and then on top of that you might
be spending X dollars amount of months
for a Netflix whose Netflix subscription
or whatever other subscription you might
be putting on top of that and then you
get a few those in there and then you've
kind of reached your saturation point
for how much content you can actually
watch right and bear in mind that a
standard internet connection will also
get you a connection to YouTube as well
as a bunch of other streaming services
that you don't have to pay a monthly
monthly fee for it and you're probably
doing okay when it comes to having stuff
to point your eyeballs to distract you
from your constant yeah
constant hellish existence that you
actually lived through in fact the
deaths cut off to us all
gently very gently six
and that the cold hands cold and icy
hands obey to a death doom grasping for
us every moment of the day it's a clue
to clutch at us and and and draw us down
into another realm of pain and suffering
sorrow forever
hatred
yeah but that's why we subscribe to
Netflix that's exactly what and should
be their model marketing message Netflix
will spend as much as 8 billion dollars
producing and acquiring TV shows and
movies this year including
disenchantment from The Simpsons and
Futurama Futurama creator Matt Groening
as well as new seasons of house of cards
and making a murder house of cards very
popular show even despite Kevin Spacey's
alleged sexual harassment claims is this
little alleged I mean I mean I was being
conservative yes but who the like what
now if there's been any jury trials yet
so you're still supposed to say that
sure anyway let's move on sure I don't I
don't I don't really have any final
summation to give to that story so let's
quickly talk about net neutrality
yeah we've we've we've discussed this on
the show simply because we deal with
technology we deal with the Internet and
we personally feel that net neutrality
is a good thing and that if you pay for
a connection to the Internet that your
internet service provider should have no
place in telling you or telling you what
services or websites you can connect to
or not connect to or charging you more
for this or less for that or throttling
certain connections to certain points in
the internet right now the FCC
right now has really gone the other way
according to stuff that we were kind of
excited back about back in 2005 so
people hate as you pi
pretty universally in my experience but
that doesn't mean that there is no way
to fight back so amongst the ways to
fight back we have had a lot of states
introducing their own net neutrality
laws but there's also been some action
on the federal level so there is a bill
intended to save net neutrality
specifically that has already gone
through the Senate and now actually has
its first Republican vote in the US
House yes now we try not to get into a
bunch of like politics and Republicans
versus Democrats and the contentiousness
of us u.s. politics especially right now
on the show all we try to say here is
that as we've stated we have a stance on
net neutrality for whatever warrant for
whatever reason it seems to be the
Republican side of it that's like really
against that so boggles the mind I hate
to say the like we're against the
Republicans or we're against the
Republican stance on this we're not
getting into further politics beyond
that but it is heartening that US Rep
Mike Kaufman from Colorado announced
today that was today his support for
this bill
there are currently having 76 Democrats
and one Republican on board they need 41
more votes in order to get this to have
any legs in the house there what the
reps are actually signing is a discharge
petition that would force the house to
vote on a congressional review act
resolution the resolution would reverse
the FCC's repeal of the net neutrality
rules that went into effect a month or
two ago right Senate approved the CR a
resolution back in May with votes from
all members as a Democratic caucus and
three Republican senators so three
Republican senators voted
Democrats in order to get that through
the Senate now it's up to the house to
move things forward and again there's a
long way to go but it is at least some
beam of light some some silver lining on
the clap there is at least one
Republican congressman who's been who's
been convinced to sign on with this
hopefully there will be more because the
petition means 218 signatures total and
right now a Republicans hold a 236 293
majority in the house I really hope that
the one Republican who joined on board
is like a likable Republican among his
colleagues and that some of them will
come to their senses inside with him
because sometimes it's all it takes
sometimes like everyone's thinking the
same thing but they're not actually
gonna make him move until one person
does and they're like oh he actually
stepped up to the plate and was brave
enough to take a stance on this and then
they feel a bit more confident in doing
the same because somebody's already led
trailed that path so I would hope in my
internet loving nature that more
Republicans join doing the net
neutrality side when it come because of
this point like some switch so when it
comes down to for me if you're trying to
have this net neutrality discussion with
somebody and it comes down to a sort of
a partisan political discussion in my
minds or at least in Mike my concept of
a conservative Republican stance on this
particular issue would be a pro-business
stance right and in my mind one of the
great amazing things that the Internet
has done has allowed many businesses
especially small businesses to grow and
thrive thanks to the access I mean Kyle
and I both have small businesses based
on the internet thanks to the access
that's pretty loud through the internet
large companies having the ability to
shut off certain parts of the internet
so that smaller businesses that are
involved with that part of the internet
you suddenly might have to pay extra
money for something is not a good thing
right
so in my mind if you're pro-business you
should be Pro Internet and you should be
pro net neutrality because that allows a
level playing field for anyone no matter
how small their businesses or how large
their businesses to equally access
anyone who is on the Internet and and
that that has always made sense to me
that's been sort of that the fundamental
discussion that I've had was with a few
people right when it comes to like net
neutrality especially people who say
like oh this is all about regulation
regulation and government regulation and
government regulations are bad and
everything it's like the internet is
regulated it has been regulated it's
always been regulated by the government
since it's since it from DARPA net
onwards it's going to be regulated in
some way and the discussion is how
and net neutrality to us is the obvious
answer but anyway but let's move on from
yes because dwelling on it too long
gets people upset alright as Rock has
been updating or has released updates
for their ex 399 Tai Chi motherboard to
support future thread Ripper CPUs nice
so this is not a new X 399 Tai Chi
motherboard this is their existing X 399
Tai Chi motherboard which launched back
when X 399 launched it's a good little
motherboard I built with this
motherboard and my entry-level thread
Ripper build because it's one of the
cheapest x 399 boards again by right and
it still has pretty much all the
features that you need wants when it
comes to connectivity and everything so
the upshot to this article is really
that thread Ripper processors are going
to be backwards compatible with existing
x-ray an Indian and motherboards that
seems to be the case sure with a BIOS
update you will have support for the 24
core 29 50 X which should be coming out
or the 32 core 29 90 X the question
that's raised in this article and I'm
sure will be raised by other people is
going to be when it comes to
what frequencies those processors ship
at and then in particular when it comes
to overclocking those processors because
we have to assume that AMD's can going
to continue to make them unlocked for
overclocking just as they've done with
pretty much all of their mainstream and
high-end desktop processors right like
all of them which is cool that's good we
approve with that yeah but existing x3
99 motherboards have power delivery
that's made for a 16 core processor the
additional power needs of a 24 or 30
Corp 24 or 32 core processor especially
if our clocked might be more than what
these were designed for when they were
only thinking up to 16 cores
sure that said it does seem like there
will be backwards compatibility asrock
has released this 3.0 bios for their ex
399 Taichi motherboard which is little
delivers the AMD summit P I - SP 3 r2
1.1 0.0 I think this is Anna jisuk owed
to the platform to support Andi upcoming
processors and we know that that is
starter for - because that's what AMD
has promised to launch in August
to update their BIOS as rock as released
both there you knew you knew 3.0 UEFI so
no UEFI design and they version 2.3
bridge bios which means that the X 399
tied cheap requires two separate BIOS
updates to become ready ready for
threader for two therefore threader per
second generation products so you know
not a huge deal or anything but kind of
interesting that they actually have to
do an update from an existing bios to a
bridge bios and then an update from that
bios to the actual bios in order to get
it ready for this two updates for the
new processors and I'm sure there'll be
lots of tests on existing x3 99
motherboards but also there's going to
be new updated XP 9 399 motherboards
coming out wind threader for two
launches next month so we'll hopefully
have some coverage of all that yeah
that's that's gonna be an interesting
video to see if 2nd gen throw tipper
performs the same on the newer x3 9
boards that came after its launch as
opposed to the existing x3 and boards
like the Taichi here because I think it
all depends on what angle the AMD
engineers are coming at with 2nd gen
threaded Berg if you know because they
could easily say like ok yeah we've got
a 32 32 core processor on our hands that
were going to be launching they might
think you know I would hope that they
would take into consideration that their
existing x3 99 users that might be
dropping this newer gen CPU into their
existing boards and thinking how do we
optimize the power delivery in such a
way or the efficiency of this chip so
that X existing x3 99 users have an
indistinguishable experience from the
newer x3 99 board owners
or they could just be like ork or they
could go the other route where you know
nope you know we want to have a little
bit of headroom we want to have a little
bit of benefit performance-wise and
power delivery wise with a newer x3 my
nine boards to promote these newer
boards here they'll work just fine on
the older x3 nine boards but that could
be something that's further
distinguishes the newer and the older x3
ninety nine boards from each other so it
really just depends on the sort of angle
of indirection that the and the
engineers are coming from I think
whether when they're designing this
second gender per family I think for me
it'll just be a matter of how much the
higher core count processors are
potentially held back by the first
generation motherboards if they are at
all and if I mean I imagine that will be
some especially if you're taking
overclocking into account sure but
yeah this is a reasonable time I mean
several people have suggested this but
I've never said it directly since I've
been working on this riptide build yes I
have every intention of upgrading
riptide to the 32 core 2990 X when it
becomes available Kyle's counts good
over there yeah it's looking good I'm
like ready to finish the loop right now
I would have done it earlier today but I
ran at a time or something soft tubing
or hard crystalline soft okay yeah yeah
I've got I've got one I've got one tube
installed in there so far yeah why did
you decide to go soft just curious
because I want it to be functional and
actually one of the things I'm kind of
looking forward to is if threader for
two comes out and there's new
motherboards like I'm making no
assumptions here but if my sous makes a
new Zenith like a second generation
second generation Zenith and they
provided me with that and then AMD
provides me with the 2990 X I am really
excited to swap those in because I will
be able to do it so easily with my soft
tubing and mic list quick disconnects as
opposed to having to disassemble an
entire loop and drain stuff like I
wouldn't have to drain anything I can
quick disconnect stuff to take the block
off and everything but yet intending to
hopefully upgrade to the 32 core not
sure if the motherboard upgrade will be
required or not but if it is on
go for that and then I will probably
switch to a monoblock as well because
right now the CPU block I have is not
ideal why is it ideal because it wasn't
designed for threader but it's one of
those ones that would like like the ACE
tech coolers that were designed for
Intel and mainstream CPUs that you could
put an adapter on and mount to a
threader per processor and would cool it
ok but you discover that when you
actually switch up the block design to
something that's specifically that's
larger to actually go over all the dyes
and everything that suddenly that you
actually get much better cooling so hmm
yeah that's my plan okay
do you mind if I treat a picture of it
right now oh yeah go for it
I've already done that okay I mean as
long as there's no horrible no there's
nothing incriminating on there hey all
right
no incriminate I just tweeted a picture
of the progress they're not like palace
picture do it alright one last news
story here Samsung has revealed the
world's first LP ddr5 class 10
nanometers ear an LP does that mean low
profile actually means low power that
will power the other L power low power
ddr5 other LP from across the yard
it's a little individual chips as you
can see right there so they've added
this 8 gigabits lpddr4 DRAM to their
product lineup so each of these chips is
basically one gigabyte the mood of
memory which expands that lineup and
also improves from the older generation
lpddr4 to LP ddr5 so kind of like the
upgrade from ddr3 to DDR for sure
upgrading to lpddr4 upgrading from
lpddr4 to LP gddr5 mmm provides higher
data rates lower levels of power
consumption
as you might expect which means they're
great for mobile devices also like I
have no idea I don't have speculate much
I'm like production or whatever but if
they're suddenly able to pump this out
and it's great for mobile devices then
yeah I have no idea but maybe like in my
head I think maybe that will lessen the
demand for the memory that's been
conflicting and causing like really high
memory prices on the on the CB kinda the
D Ramsay you know yeah Graham said sure
yeah I don't know but it should but the
thought you know that's not outside the
realm of possibility true but this move
from LP but I don't want to say that
like you could take something that's
designed for lpddr4 and take one of
these and just drop it and that's
probably not the case sure
these new a gigabit chips offer data
rates up to 6400 megabits per second
that's significantly faster than layer
highest-end lpddr4 X memory which does
4266 megabytes a second that's it absent
nice jump 1200 to 6400 Wow
it's like another that's a 33% ish jump
yeah
to start they're gonna ship memory with
speeds of 6,400 megabits per second and
55 mega 5,500 megabits per second
operating at one point one volts and one
point oh five volts and then they expect
this memory to power future ai and 5g
mobile applications as well as of course
probably going to be a lot of smart lose
yep that's my proposed baby cool so yeah
a new memory let's let's let's let's
move into our next segment Oh what are
we gonna we're gonna do some certified
so weird fight yay I feel like we have a
new the sword fight in my last exert
fight it's been a while all right
I'm Kyle so half of the show we already
started discussing this and so we're
going to assume that you have watched
that and have some basis on this but so
quickly recap virtual link is a new USBC
based cable with a new protocol virtual
link which gives a little bit more
bandwidth than your thunderbolt
connection in order to provide a single
cable for both the USB as well as the
video connection from a VR headsets so a
standardized connection for VR headsets
and one that has been embraced by quite
a few companies including Nvidia and AMD
and Microsoft's an oculus
HTC so like all the big players in VR
right now so instead of having something
like this with the power and a USB and
an HDMI the cable set for a cookie but
you need to vibe to connect with right
now cumbersome you will simply have a
single USB type-c connector okay you
scroll to a very complicated looking
graph this is an end this isn't an end
tech article which means they get into a
bit more of the the details of it short
but there's gonna be a single type-c
connector yes
so one and type two here are the
different modes it's basically like a
display port connection giving you three
thirty two point four gigabits per
second right just for video bandwidth
right plus an additional ten for USB
three sure and high-speed Lane parison
powers included in that connector as
well that's important so you can carry
cuz I'll be able to power like a headset
or something like that right okay so
what are we arguing today if this is
gonna be better for VRS a question like
we did a we did a decent amount of VR
stuff a couple years back we got our
oculus rifts and our HTC fives yep
didn't really grab on like you know
there's not a lot of people still
building like here's a VR build or
whatever right great right like it's
it's can not reach a people don't use it
or anything but it's nice and it's not
something that seems to have caught on
big-time so here's the question is this
gonna change that is virtual link and
the fact that this hardware solution is
not going to be more streamlined with a
single cable
will that affect the adoption of VR are
we gonna see more VR headsets sold are
we going to see more people into VR in
general because of this as we are going
to take off basically in the way that
people were maybe expecting a couple
years back with the initial launch of
those headsets now that this new
standard has been adopted
what do you think okay I'm gonna go the
easy route and give you the burden of
arguing devil's advocate I'm gonna say
that no VR had its chance is a dead
French technology which is only semi
true of what I believe I don't think
that this standardization this new spec
will be the thing that convinces people
that finally makes VR go mainstream I
think it's more than that I think it's
the the amount of horsepower and
processing power that's required to
drive full and rich VR experiences
that's the bigger wall between the
mainstream consumer and VR you need you
need a pretty decently either mid-range
to high-end gaming PC to run these
excellent VR experiences smoothly and I
don't think that you know when we've
discussed this in the past where like
you know VR has not really taken off
like a lot of people speculated we never
once brought up the cable situation well
it's you know because you got USB and
HDMI and power that you all got to plug
in simultaneously but it was never
brought up it was always the biggest
barrier to entry for VR was always the
price that came with the headset itself
with the whole ecosystem and the PC that
was required to drive it so I think that
this is a good step forward I think that
standardization for this type of thing
is a good thing overall and it will
prove beneficial in the long run but I
don't think it's gonna get us many steps
closer to wide widespread adoption of VR
I think optimization needs to happen
and and it's you know it's yeah
optimization needs to happen you know
people need to be able to run this on
their old pre-built Dell systems in
order for it to be mainstream because
that's the mainstream computing system
that most people have right now and
granted I'll give HCC and oculus a bone
because they have dropped the prices of
their headsets pretty significantly
since their first launch but you still
need the hardware to drive them so
so I remove your move you mentioned that
and I think Paul's looking up facts
since he's cheating cheating for face
off his son nice our fight I saw an ad
today for oculus rift plus touch
controllers for like 250 bucks or
something ridiculous like that it looks
like it's still four hundred but hey
obviously I was wrong he said he said no
but yes actually yes
once virtual link becomes standardized
we will see a renaissance in the VRS
space in fact you know count mentions a
good point he brings up a good point
when it comes to the the barrier to
entry to VR and needing a high-end PC
but really that's been essentially
eliminated by the reduced prices of
graphics cards recently we discussed
earlier in the show eight two percent
reduction the price graphics are just
recently so obviously everyone now has a
really powerful gaming PC with a
high-end graphics card like gtx 1066 gig
or an RX 588 gig or above which is
perfectly capable of playing VR so
that's that's not an issue not really a
problem anyone really what it comes down
to is the immersion and people's level
of
the amount of joy or value that they get
out of the VR experience and often that
was detracted from or people would often
complain about being pulled out of the
VR experience because they're suddenly
tripping over a cord or something like
that because they've got this book these
set up cords coming off of their headset
that's to go over and we can connect
into the PC this will not be the case
anymore
we have a simple slim USB type-c cable
can easily be routed up over the head I
mean that's not gonna be tugging on you
all the time or anything like that
so this is going to be the catalyst I
think that really spurs a new era of VR
adoption we're gonna see a lot more
people playing VR games we're going to
see developers developing VR games do
well it's gonna be it's going to be
better and more awesome than anyone
could ever have imagined before and
anyone who says otherwise hates America
that's compelling compelling telling
arguments before thank you before we see
how much our arguments have swayed your
opinion we're gonna quickly take a look
at the next question okay
Whiteley less serious so we can argue
that more quickly hopefully all right
summer question though summer question
this has come up for me recently because
I've been playing overwatch a decent
amount with my wife but if it is summer
and it is hot and you're playing a PC
and you're gaming in a room and it gets
hot sometimes you have two choices
maybe based on the cost of electricity
or maybe simply based on like the fact
that you don't want a trip a breaker or
something like that you can either keep
the a/c on and the computer off or vice
versa but PC gaming
and AC at the same time maybe that's not
a maybe that's not a legitimate option
for you so wait why wouldn't that be a
legitimate option just don't don't don't
ask the question why you're not asking
why that's why we're just saying okay in
this hypothetical situation if you had
to choose gaming without air
conditioning in the summer or air
conditioning but no gaming in the summer
what would you choose why not both
everyone get everyone feel free to go
ahead I went first last time vote on
that first we got to get the results
from the first best sure obviously VR
let's see what you get said about this
one everyone has tried VR porn but our
votes are actually very close sprinkling
water very close but yes Wow it looks
like I win Kyle Wow people would totally
be into VR if there was just one
annoying to the cable instead of thing
see it's the way you phrased it though
it's phrasing
yes is because I haven't seen ooh which
one you were gonna choose given that you
had free range this sounds like this
presidential election of the what was
Russia's involvement in this straw poll
answer I win and everyone is waiting to
the airport but let's get back to the
summer question all right gaming with
eight gaming but no IC or AC with no
game AC but no gaming oh God what about
can you have a fan
fan blowing on you can use our everyone
I didn't I didn't get that far all right
you argue first that's a good question
that this is the first question it's the
only questions I'm gonna go I'm gonna go
based on what we've actually been doing
and I'm gonna say you know what gaming
with no AC because you know you don't
really believe that hear me out here you
down you obviously our viewers you know
you know they're hard workers they
probably got the day job day jobs
they're not gaming during the day you
know you're you gotta get your work done
during the day got it work before you
get your play in so in the evening Sun
Goes Down sure it's summer sure it's
still hot but when the Sun Goes Down you
gotta turn the AC off you can open up
your windows turn on your fans get some
air flow to the house and then you can
still game sure it's a little warm but
you know you gotta look past that and
you got to remember that when when
you're warm it increases your reaction
time your your deductive skills critical
critical reasoning capabilities as well
as
as well as well as technical you know
it's it's pretty warm in here right now
and Paul is having a hard time finishing
his - no no just just let that sink in
all these things help you let me help
you when you're feeling warm you know
your ma respond here we're here looser
right here loosen so you're playing
you're your first-person-shooter
whatever you're gonna get get more head
shots
we're gonna be an overall better
performer it's like why people go into a
sauna you know people go into a sauna
again if Rousseau gave me a ninja you
know like all the big all the big one
needs to be thing they're office so
there ya know all right I'm gonna tell
you why you're wrong Paul clearly you're
gonna have to put PC gaming on hold just
temporarily you don't have to give it up
for life but you know what when it's
when it's really hot inside it's
sometimes not worth it because PC gaming
is only fun when it's fun and you can't
enjoy something when you're miserable
and I know at least for me like I'm a
sweaty person in general and when things
are hot I can't enjoy anything I'm
irritable I need there to be a cool
environment in order for me to enjoy
anything in life and especially if I'm
gonna go hard if I'm gonna go hard and
I'm really gonna PC game you have to
consider that the system your gaming on
is gonna generate additional heat that's
gonna be brought into your room unless
you have some sort of balls-to-the-wall
system that exhausts the hot air from
your system outside which 99.9% of us
don't have so that's gonna increase
ambient temperatures even further and
the last thing you want is like sweat
literally dripping off of your eyebrows
into your eyes like the saltiness just
like having to wipe it out like your KD
ratio is going to plummet in those types
of conditions
that's why anytime you go to like an
eSports event or like a LAN tournament
or something like that they have pretty
decent cooling because they understand
this as an important facet of PC gaming
is comfort that's why we spend hundreds
of dollars on game
chairs and high display refresh rate
monitors and so forth is because comfort
is everything that that's we we enjoy
not seeing sunlight we can go days weeks
without seeing the Sun because we're
comfortable and you can't do that when
you're smoldering in the frickin heat
doesn't matter how good at gaming you
are you're gonna be measurement didn't
you just do a video recently I'm just
building a fan okay so shut up no next
your opinion this is set your trap it's
nothing to do with it I have a feeling
and I feel sweep Oh only 24% of people
are willing to give up PC gaming very
that comfort of their conditioning
clearly was not it obviously you're not
dedicated enough to the PC gaming cause
cow apparently not apparently no but you
know what I'll be cool one many people
many people are disappointed you know
it's okay but yeah I'm a little
disappointed knows that's what the show
is all about is learning learning mutual
learning more about me and Kyle all
right it's all about amazing going this
and what that alright mostly the coming
that is all for sword fight and now we
have alright some mail time mail Oh
okay no time all right let's let's got a
few back here here all right
these are all sent to my appeal bond
right here oh if you want to send
something to my PA box and have it open
done awesome hardware during mealtime
sentence you're cool
- pulse hardware gearbox for three to
five Diamond Bar California than one set
is expect if you want to send cool stuff
to Kyle then look in the video
description of my youtube videos you
don't know your p.o box that name I'll
suck your head I'm trying to remember it
right now it's night no peel box fort oh
 I don't remember it I'm blinking
I'm like I usually know it but I'm
likely right now it's very unfortunate
pass that app yeah I'm gonna get the
rate in a second
oh wait guys hold on oh okay bo Hogg
this is 1449 that's what it is
teal bucks 1449 in La Mirada California
nine oh six three eight
of course I'm awesome I'm Paul is what
the truce okay okay Bianca's will you
wear this every day out in public I
guess you way I can wear that from this
is from the shipping department or this
exhale shipping department hold shipping
department thinks you're absolutely
great so somebody has sent me a shirt
you bought two it's good fun is this oh
they know your size that is creepy but
very personal thank you to whoever said
this I have no idea
so this is there was no message in here
it says easy DIY to the AB Mazen China's
an Amazon shipment so somebody I think
ordered this remembers on cassette it
shipped here okay you could very well
mean that that's just it's just some
random RGB fit RGB fans the same three
RGB fans free probably look like a
built-in controller or something buddy
advertising for easy DIY easy DIY f8
yeah it's kind of controller and
everything all actual like remote okay
RGB fan someone someone thinks that you
lack RGB somehow I have so many RGB fans
right someone thinks you're hey this one
I know is from an actual fan at
restoration
oh it's sent from a peel box that
doesn't matter and ruch wire why are the
silver damaged wire I feel like he was
he was this came from Canada so I'm not
sure what the deal is with this I feel
like he's been threatening to send this
stuff for a little bit anything okay hi
Paul and Kyle I've sent you the 6600 K
that I talked about a few awesome
harbors ago I know I've tried to test it
and get it to work but I'm lacking the
diversity of hardware to accurately test
and finalize its death I'm still hopeful
that it works but if it's dead what
better place to send it than the CPU
collection / great girl I'm looking
forward to hearing back on the auto auto
fly report either through my email or my
Twitter Cheers
Andrew Schwab Tesla Andrews sent us
cables and potentially that he believes
yeah as delayed high-five 6600 K Oh 66
okay 6600 ha so we were gonna we're
gonna get right we're gonna right to
testing this absolutely immediately
after the show you should test it
because if it works then hey you got a
free 66 bag and sell it for probably a
decent profit if you sign it it's even
got like original thermal pastes
included as part of the package here
which I appreciate that is it some
authentic I'm not sure why there's a red
sticker on it but I don't see any
immediate to indicate physical damage to
it
so maybe maybe maybe it is just fine
could be thank you Andrew we will second
grace my way here what's all I get that
figured out for you is that mail time
that is mail time okay cool that was
pretty quick uh yeah cuz I forgot the
spoon bye Mikey Calvin vacuum or maybe
my dad made it for perhaps next week I'm
free to send us more stuff so are we
going on to donation Matt time in the
future yes so processing our good friend
and moderator done all five dollars so
I'll be 39 next week meaning I will be
dead soon it's a sell so here is five
dollars to show my affection also I gave
Kyle five last week so it's your turn
so happier what they made me early
birthday you don't look a day over
thirty nine seven thirty nine I mean 39
is way you're still very young
yeah you're not even 40 yet yeah you
have a whole year ahead of you before
year old before you're actually like on
death story before you're old and no one
cares about you I say this knowing that
I'm not that much younger than you
you're next well thank you very much
Excel cells our moderators awesome
he's got $50 rampage six extreme
motherboard or eight gigabyte sticks of
RAM dim Siwon is dead I put all
four sticks in slots b1 b2 a1 and a2
window sees all 32 gigs of ram any
issues with ram this way while I wait on
a new motherboard by the way Kyle I am
NOT rich money I give is from a
part-time job no offense taken
until you mention that the Galactic
bazinga no I think you're fine as we
kind of talked about
earlier in the show or in Cal's half
there are some other boards that
specifically require you to use a first
bank and a second bank of RAM slots for
your for your dual channel support or
your quad channel support or whatever
yeah you might have but there's also
plenty of other boards that are like hey
you can use these for slots or you can
use these for slots and it looks like
your sounds like you're just using the
four slots that don't include the one
that has a bad dim slot so I think your
take your good word I have a doctor for
99 Kyle if you put Lyle in the title I
bet you'd get so so many views probably
not accurate
also congrats on 1 million thank you
very much Paul can't wait for the next
time you grow the beer thank you I'm the
doctor I'll probably grow the beard in
November again mmm that'd be an event
beard I kind of like the beard you know
what I would totally forgotten this this
entire show was supposed to be a
celebration of me hitting 800,000
subject oh yeah Congrats
I noticed that today briefly the holy
name in RK it jumped up I thought it was
one I have it for a few more days right
but I did like a sort of matte very well
publicized giveaway and a video earlier
from last week oh okay but there's a big
jump over subscribers so I quietly
passed a terrible congratulations thank
you let's thank you 800 K is good number
Kratts at a million
hello yeah thank you um cool Adam
Arkwright for 10 bucks hey guys just
finished my first build a few weeks ago
thanks to you just want to know what
would be a good monitor to game on
should I get a 144 Hertz monitor thank
you I'll see you guys at comic-con oh
cool we'll see you there
it's hard to say if 144 Hertz monitor
would be worth it to you if we don't
know the graphics card that you're
rocking if you have a 1066 gig if I
eight gig greater than 70 or above or
but then it might be worth investing in
a hundred forty-four Hertz monitor I
would say 2560 by 1440 is a resolution
you should go for yeah cuz that's really
cool hi ever frustrate gaming is is
really cool your phone of the things you
can do with PC gaming that you really
can't with any other little consoles or
anything like that
1440s you're so nice even working forty
it's a really solid being when you're
not gaming better than 1080 resolution
that can handle higher refresh rates it
doesn't need a crazy high-end graphics
card to to push yeah so that's what I
would look for yep thank you very much
Adam hi save $10 hello guys second
donation here so you got 15 from me
thanks hello would you drink something
else other than beer if I sent it to you
I am I am also challenging years in
recovery
well I save in recovery from I'm
guessing from Nancy from alcohol oh I'm
out which would be my guess ah yes then
send us all of the alcohol you didn't
drink before you came became sober but
mostly stick to beer and a lot of it is
just because like when I drink hard
alcohol it's it's too much too fast and
yeah yeah it gets dangerous right I'm
not opposed to drinking other stuff sure
um congratulations and please please do
keep it up if you're 15 years in
recovery and
you've got your hey you gave it a clean
you look like that man eyes you're
involved with that kind of thing but um
but yeah that's all honestly this is the
thing that whenever we talk about
drinking on the show and stuff I feel
the most like self conscious or remorse
about or whatever it's like people are
struggling with I know there are people
who struggle with with drinking too much
and I never want to be someone who's
like enabling that sure whatever so I
don't know I mean yeah but we're not
we're not advertising that you drink
often and so that's hopefully why would
we try to say only same thing
responsibly please do it responsibly
right only do it if you're of age and
it's honestly if you're in a situation
where you can't because sometimes people
you know if you've handled all your
stuff right you've got some leisure time
then that's okay yeah I'm so sorry
thank you for another but that thank you
guys see ya
thanks man yes we would drink something
other than beer we'll try anything once
so go ahead so it's garrison seven $5
hey I work for Geek Squad
not only did both of your videos help me
get my job they helped me every single
day without putting tech to my clients
thank you nice that's awesome
great I'm glad that we are up health to
your job and that we helped you get the
job first load that's up that's great
Thank You dur Tim we're doing the Lord's
work my friend
we're job weird yeah we're job creators
we are exactly
we gave them given that job frosted moon
once again ten Canadians I do have a
question after all do you two think it
would be a good idea to buy a 1080i now
or should I wait for the 11/20 series I
would wait yeah at this point just
because all of the scuttlebutt seems to
indicate that there's something
something coming down the pipeline
relatively soon good kind of good if it
were if it were four months or a
half-year out then I would say go ahead
and buy but if we're run around with
this in the next couple months you know
I want to hang out hang out for a bit
see what happens you might even find a
good deal on a 1080i yeah once once that
series drops there should be at least a
brief period of time where 1080 T eyes
are cheaper yeah before all the stock
gets sold out and then suddenly they
become crazy more expensive yeah center-
seven dollars and seventy seven sets of
P&amp;amp;K oh that's that's us that's us for
many reviews it seems vega 64 adam
boards should beat a 1080 founders
edition by five to ten percent my Asus
Vega 64 runs 10% slower than my 1080 for
the win hybrid does that seem right to
you
okay asus vegas 64 i know early tests
with some cards showed the aftermarket
vegas 64 from asus running slower than
the reference design which is weird i
never followed up on that much though
it's a bios issue I think so yeah it
also really depends on what games you're
playing or what tests you're running to
compare the two of those to each other
in from from my understanding although I
haven't looked in at any specific
benchmarks just recently there should be
some applications or games where the
Vegas 64 wins and some where the 1080
wins mm-hmm
so yeah it would depend them on what
you're testing which we don't know from
your comment unfortunately yeah that
doesn't seem like too outside the bounds
of reason for you for me but no cuz he's
comparing it to a for the win Hybrid so
I would think that sounds about right
I don't think anything's out of the
ordinary there yeah Thank You senator
negative M b67 $13 37 cents Paul
I like your Riptide series of videos and
they're giving me ideas for a water loop
build with quick disconnects Thank You
Kyle the article from hardware was wrong
the Nvidia shield never went on 600 lot
hardware lied to us
and I resent them for it forever we'll
never use any of their great articles
ever again on the show but yeah thank
you I'm really excited about that in
fact today my plan was to finish
everything I needed to finish so I could
get more of the tubes installed there of
course everything I needed to finish
took up pretty much the whole day so I
never got to that but tomorrow I'm gonna
be kickin that up so I'm gonna try it
it's a tweet some stuff I need to be
tweeting like projects like that as I'm
going through them and building them but
there should be a part 5 video very soon
later this week
and hopefully actually get get some
water in the wire hoop which would be
awesome
nice wobble for $5 hey Kyle whatever
happened to the PC built from $400 PC on
Amazon video August 20th 2017 that's a
while back
oh wow they have it that's almost a year
ago if I'd never followed up with a
video on that actual PC I know I did a
parts selection video where I went on
Amazon now it kind of might have like
even stream it but I recorded my time on
Amazon looking for parts for a 400 PC I
made had a piece that build together and
actually bought the parts for it but I
at least provided the links and prices
for supports thought I would have used I
don't know
life happens and sometimes we set out to
do videos and we have these great ideas
and then sometimes we don't always do
every single one of them like the htpc
part 2 video right no that's still
coming I'm still gonna yes do that
of course Paul I don't forgot about that
either Nick Duncan $9.99 cheers keep up
the good work keep up the good donation
sir yes thank you thank you very much
mr. Duncan here's to you as well Jordan
Lynn $20 I have an r radeon HD 6970 and
it idles at about 70 degrees C and will
spike over a hundred C and thermally
shut down wanting a new full build
should I get a ten sixty or ten seventy
while waiting for a 1080p eye to come
down in to come down or eleven series to
come out i 720 600 K only hits 50 C i
garden I think I think like the previous
commenter who asks the similar question
wait it's good it's just because we're
expecting this with stuff pretty soon
now is the time to wait that's a good
time to wait and just see what happens
if you can hold that for a couple more
months
yeah if you're really like can't deal
with your current graphics card then I
would say investing in a dt x 1070 right
now 400 bucks is you know it's not bad
not a bad deal yeah fun facility time v
australia's hi guys any advance on a
mini ITX case and the advice on a mini
ITX case would love to do a heart tubing
projects with a small form-factor case
or both for both performance and visuals
thanks the H 200 I from NZXT is a pretty
solid contender for that yeah I think
the fractal design fractal nano nano s
yeah the Nano s is a really good one Jay
did an amazing water coal bill than that
I think that would be a phenomenal
option I did - you - oh you did - you're
a hot box that's right my wife's
computer hot box define an OS right you
60 or 70 bucks yes and yeah and it's a
like if you're gonna be water cooling in
a mini ITX build it's worth looking at
some of the mini ITX
cases they're a slightly larger yeah so
something like a nano s no room for
we're just gonna give you a little bit
more space to work with frame speed si
is tenkan 80s when streaming on twitch
streaming twitch on a PC will my GPU
tend to DTI affect my performance during
gameplay or does the CPU play a bigger
part in this whole streaming biz great
streams tonight you guys have a good
night
the CPU is gonna be mostly what's
responsible for your streaming
performance so you want to have a good
strong CPU of enough cores and threads
and clock speeds to handle your
streaming the graphics card is primarily
for for you the user to make sure that
you have a decent gaming experience
while you're streaming but also for your
for your viewers because if you're only
straight you know if you're only able to
pump out let's say 27 frames a second
with your 1050 or whatever graphics card
you're using that will also look choppy
for your viewers even though the stream
might look good if your framerate is bad
and you're projecting that to your
audience it's it's gonna be a lackluster
viewing experience so it's hard to give
to specific of advice without knowing
exactly what game you're playing and
resolution and settings stuff like that
but generally speaking right now the six
core options have been better for gaming
and streaming at the same time so a lot
of AMD's options whether you're talking
about first gen rising stuff like a 1600
or the second generation stuff that six
core are good options to go with your
1050 Ti is going to affect what max
resolution and max settings you can play
the game at reasonably as far as what
you're seeing if your CPU has enough
overhead available to also encode what
you're seeing for your for your viewers
then that's kind of the best of both
worlds so even with the 1050 Ti if you
paired that with a at least a decent
quad core with hyper-threading processor
but more ideally a 6 core processor then
you'd probably have a good gaming
experience for yourself if you're
playing at 1080 as well as a good
streaming experience for the people
watching thank you very much for the
donation crit fish $5 hey guys I have an
r5 2600 X with an asus x4 70 pro
motherboard I upgraded from 2 8 by 8 gig
sticks rip just five thirty two hundred
two four eight gig sticks and dropped a
50 FPS average any thoughts
upgraded from two by eight to four by
eight is he saying he dropped like his
performance sort of sounds like dropped
my guess would be then if you when you
upgraded that somehow your memory
settings changed and that you're not
actually running your memory at 3200
speed anymore
to buy eight gigs or four by eight gigs
of memory running at 3200 speed should
be exactly the same performance if
they're all running at 3800 speed frame
I'm not sure why yes definitely there
are some rising configurations that have
a harder time running a four gig or four
stick configuration than a two-state
configuration
none of that 50 FPS drop though that's
something else I something the way he
describes that it's hard to say he
dropped 50 fps I'm not sure exactly what
he means by that but yeah my guess would
be that when you added more memory that
your memory speed settings changed
somehow so definitely try doing an a/b
comparison with only two sticks versus
all four sticks in double check and
reality check and make sure that you're
actually running at the speed at 3200
speed or not and also consider that
depending on the memory kit that you're
using you might just not be able to run
the four stick configuration you might
have to stick with 2 by 8 gig sticks if
you're focused on overall gaming
performance and overall gaming
performance would be working more
focused on keeping your memory speed
running as fast as possible
hopefully that helps Thank You crit fish
word Andrew mcgowa mcgowan 5 euros hi
Paul Kyle don't try to say my name it's
Irish oh well we already did Julie I'm
looking at a TV ga 1080 for the 1/2 or
gigabyte g1 gaming 1080 which should I
go for or the cheapest 1080 for the one
to you by doing gaming go over the
cheapest yeah they're gonna perform on
par not gonna be much of a difference to
those Johnny will in $10 hello again
Oris expand gaming 7 pro versus an asus
strix X $2.99 xe4 an unread build with a
79 80 X Ino overclocked for nvme drives
- from the PCIe slots and ain't SATA
drives PCIe price is not a factor can't
decide I can't imagine the motherboard
choice in this configuration having a
huge impact on your overall performance
yeah I don't know specifically if
there's much connectivity difference
between the Auris X 299 gaming 7 or the
Strix X - 99 - X e yeah so as long as
you have the same connectivity for both
so you can actually connect up all your
nvme drives that you want and all your
SATA drives that you want and it boils
down to cosmetics yeah it honestly if
prices that I can factor then it would
blow that into cosmetics at that point
so so yeah personal preference okay I
hope that helps Johnny a that's the okay
I wish I could give you more of a direct
buy this or buy that that's as direct as
we can give it but yeah
yeah good luck though waffle fur $5.00
here's why VR never took off its spawn
during the mining crunch it's a good
point it's probably a very legitimate I
think that's partially maybe attracted
to it at the time when people needed
maximum GPU processing power suddenly
GPU processing power became exorbitant
ly overpriced yeah yeah but headsets
Rover Christie that's it Walker thank
you as I show yes so I would say cut off
donations anyone who's planning to
donate say before next week because we
are short on time here Mark Anderson
near the last donation mark Anderson's
last donation no one donate you will not
be ready thank you though
they show was I show five dollars what's
a good laptop for editing on the go with
Premiere Pro around the 18th or dollar
budget I am not current on like best
editing laptops right now for that
budget but for that price range go for
one of the six core Intel based laptops
there's a decent amount of them out now
you just want one of the at least a 1070
yes a at least of gtx 1070 max-q or not
other than that weird we're not that
familiar with specific lab yeah model
numbers right or we can tell you what
Guido subdued judo dollars hey guys I'm
doing a teardown and cleanup of my 1700
X bill do you have any tips for cleaning
fans of heavy dust also take my daughter
Horace I would remove the fans if
they're really dusted up and and sprayed
the crap out of them you do some
compressed air or whatever what have you
and then go with like a microfiber cloth
or some other cleaning cloth and just
just work it in with your fingers and
stuff until all the dust is gone maybe
give it a couple more sprays just just
some good old-fashioned elbow grease
well we'll get those fans clean if
you're talking dust only then Kyle's
advice is good if you got stuff that's
cake down there whatever that's
coming off then you really can't get
better than like q-tips with some sort
of solvents like goo gone or like it's
just a isopropyl alcohol mixed with
water like 50/50 blends and get that and
dip it in and just clean off each blade
it's really a very tedious and
time-consuming but personally I've never
had to do but yeah that's that's really
it's really as far as you can go I think
yeah not a lot Guido yep senator
negative five dollars shipping in for
the cell processing birthday gift oh
yeah I like that we're kids of yourself
mr. Bert that's good wait we only have
five dollars to stripper Chris Reece FFA
I know it's 99 cents you guys are
awesome thanks for all the incredible
content wishing you nothing but success
in the future
thank you Chris appreciate it lovely and
with your ten bucks a lovely person we
will definitely succeed there's no way
you know Andrew Schwarz hundred years
thanks for unboxing it best of luck to
you maybe one day I'll send a bottle of
some who got one of my favorite liqueurs
or liquors yeah send us somewhere
wouldn't wouldn't say no like we could
we could get totally smashed on the show
won't tear you down it's never having
before thanks for the 16600 cake yeah
bye polar bear HD $5 Thank You Kyle and
Paul your videos helped me build my
first PC and help store my path into
computer science degrees my computer
science degree you are awesome that's
yeah you'll probably very soon know more
than us then yeah cuz neither of us have
said anything how did you not go to
school for formal training at all nope
in any sense so but good luck to you
went to your degree yes I'm glad we glad
we could help
Elya wasted space 20 great British
pounds long-term fan and once in a blue
moon I get to catch you guys live thanks
V entertainment from you both that
riptide bill is gonna be amazing good
luck getting things to fit no epic water
cool build would be without its issues
that's that amen to that that's so true
I'm sorry I'm really so ready for
tomorrow and just put
gonna finish it off but the rest of the
stuff together and in the thing that I
know can just don't go together and I'm
pretty sure I've got everything figured
out as far as those little details of
where things go and everything I just
need to get the tubing worked out and
stuff so yeah hopefully tomorrow will be
fun sweet
all right and then next up we've go
Micah Carter like your car I have
dollars to say guys plenty rebuild that
we'll be able to game streaming 3d model
this is adequate or would you change
with the PC part picker list link I'm
doing it in time DRM 7 TV $12 of one two
three four dollars and thirty four cents
salute a gentleman to both at all loyal
fans and Watchers love the show thank
you dear M and we agree and salute a
back back to you oh yeah what do you say
Mike a your system is great Verizon 720
700 X and the gtx 1070 TI you're golden
oh yeah you've got 16 gigs of ram i
think that's plenty you've got good
solid state representation here a decent
case a really good case to find r6 he's
even got a mic um yeah that stream deck
and everything good no this is a twenty
three hundred dollar system there abouts
and but it includes a lot of peripherals
and stuff like that that that people
don't often include so sure that's a
thousand dollar system still that's a
great setup it's gonna last you a while
yeah who are we on now wasted space yes
wasting space british pounds a more
serious question currently running the
5820k 32 gigs of ram 1080i i'm a content
creator starting to see performance
heads streaming surprisingly do I go
8700 or 78 20 X for premiere performance
for premiere pro performance and
streaming
ah that's a good question because you've
already got a 5820k which is not bad I'm
kind of surprised actually that you're
seeing in the streaming performance
issues it's maybe double check your
streaming for four or your streaming
settings to see if that's really the
case because you should be totally
golden with those specs streaming
totally golden there's no reason you
need to upgrade unless you're doing some
crazy like 4k streaming it so that
you're a high bit rates at 60fps
there's no reason III can't see it so
double check your stream settings and
let's say you had a weaker CPU and it
was definitely time for you to upgrade I
would wait till the ninth gen core CPUs
come out and before you pull the trigger
on Nate hey yeah pending on the price
you might be more drawn to an eighth
course not man honestly for what you're
doing if you're a content creator eighty
seven hundred K or seventy eight 20x I
feel like you get better bang for your
buck with the mange either of those with
the with the twenty seven hundred their
prices yeah Addison yeah cuz they ain't
Court resins are of a grateful man it's
set up for really really good streaming
really a lot less money than you have to
pay for the Intel high-end desktop stuff
right so yeah beefy 450 boards are right
around the corner
so yeah market also boasts of people in
chat recommend you to check the internet
because we it might be lag spikes it's
causing those issues yeah that's true
was screaming yeah because yeah that
does it seems like you have a very
powerful system for doing what you're
doing with six cores and everything
shouldn't be should be okay yeah
especially with the 1080 1080 Ti and
especially with that much memory yeah
Mark Anderson 5 Australia's you guys
play much VR these days haven't touched
it in a lot yeah it's been the loudest I
feel like once VR if VR gains more
mainstream appeal then we might be able
to be doing more content on it but for
now it's a very niche category that I
feel like very nice channels are
covering like VR channels with ok I keep
thinking with my HTTP see build like I
want to get this set up so the VR setup
is ready to go out here and I can play
it yeah but I haven't gotten that far
yeah so yeah not much but that's not to
say I don't want to yeah right
I played here a lot more than you do
when you jump into it and you have a
good time it's like wow that was such a
cool experience
yeah so and I'm sure VR games have come
so far since we'd like last played yeah
there's somebody been some advancements
yeah we need to check in on alright John
quick couple quick Johnson's I've only
got one it looks like I only got a
couple on additional from Blair Blair G
