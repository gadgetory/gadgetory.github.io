hey guys and welcome back to Pauls
hardware today is a very special video
because I've been working my tail off
for the past few days benchmarking this
video card right here this is the AMD r9
290x this is the Hawaii GPU based video
card that was announced in Hawaii
coincidentally enough just about a month
or two ago and we've been waiting for it
to come out
brand new silicon from AMD it's still
based on the GCN architecture the 28
nanometer architecture that the 7000
series is based on but this one is all
new
it's bigger 2,816 stream processors as
opposed to 2048 from the 7970 1,000
megahertz GPU core clock memory runs at
1250 5.6 teraflops of compute
performance 4 gigs of 512 bit gddr5
memory which is totally sweet so this is
designed for high resolution gaming
they're specifically aiming it at 1440
1600 and 4k gaming but one thing that
you might mention if you go over to new
egg and check out our benchmarks that
we've run over there there's some folks
who maybe missed the invite to the party
and they are right back here this is
nvidia gtx 770 yeah this is in videos
gtx 780 I don't have a 780ti at this
point unfortunately but I've also got
the GTX Titan now if you look at our in
our new mega benchmarks we don't always
include Nvidia side benchmarks and the
reasons are many but let's just leave it
at we work for a company that works with
both of those companies and there's just
no way to make both sides happy however
on my channel I am more than happy to
pit these against each other so this
video is going to be some benchmarks of
the r9 290x brand-new card using the 13
mm drivers and I'm going to throw in the
Titan and the 780 and the 770 which is
down in my lap and we'll see who comes
out on top let's see how the 290x
stacks up
there you have it guys some benchmark
comparisons and then closing let's see
the 290x does a fantastic job
the 770 first stop is priced at $400 at
least as of the filming of this video
the 290x priced at 550 so bear that in
mind the 770 costs you a bit less money
which is kind of nice
770 is kind of on the same level to GTX
680 and I'd say the 770 matches up a bit
better with the 280 X which is related
to the 7970 if you're following all
these letters and numbers I'm quite
impressed cuz I have a hard time keeping
them down myself
the 780 right here he's supposed to be a
bit more of a direct competitor with the
290 X now bear in mind the 290x launch
price 550 the 780 currently selling for
650 dollars so given the fact that the
290x can actually beat the 780 in
several benchmarks I would say the 780
maybe has a price drop coming that's
always a good thing when new graphics
cards come out
however the 780 Ti is poised on the
horizon - hopefully jump in and take the
780 s place as the almost best of the
best card from Nvidia the Titan over
here it's still a very very very
fantastic card and add $1,000 maybe not
the best price performance that you
might expect the Titan I feel Nvidia
gears a bit more towards people who are
doing GPU compute stuff the amount of
CUDA core is the double floating-point
precision functionality that's built
into the Titan a bit more geared towards
that so it's more of a bargain rendering
workstation card than it is a super
high-end graphics card however still not
quite the best bang for your buck if
you're specifically going just for
gaming and again a 780ti since it's
clock so high even ahead even though it
has a few fewer cuda cores than this one
780ti is probably going to beat this
when it comes to strict gaming
performance but there you have it a
quick roundup of all my benchmarks that
I currently have available to me except
maybe two-way crossfire configurations
we're gonna have a video on new ink for
that too so you can check that those
numbers out and if you guys enjoyed this
video and you want me to
bring you comparison benchmark numbers
when we do the the benchmarking over
Newegg I would be more than happy to
please leave me a comment down in the
comment section below to let me know if
that's something that you would like to
see and until next time hopefully we
have some falling GPU prices which is
always a good thing for everybody
the 290x fantastic fantastic performer
one thing I didn't want to say I've been
benchmarking this for the past few days
and I've had the privilege now working
with several pre-release video cards
super smooth testing experience with
this card the drivers were pretty much
functional right out of the bat right
out of the box or at least the download
that Andy sent me and apart from a gpu-z
glitch that they actually fixed the day
before launch as well or they sent out
an update to it everything was like
totally rock solid so I didn't even have
any only thing things I encountered was
when I was overclocking and that's kind
of goes without saying anyway but that's
all for this video thank you guys so
much for watching don't forget to leave
a comment and a like or dislike down in
the feedback section below we'll see you
all in the next Paul's Hardware video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
