hardware today I'm doing another
unboxing for another component that's
going in my personal system rebuild
because apparently I'm sadistic and I
like to put these things off as long as
I possibly can but to that end let's
take a closer look at this g.skill
ripjaws e 32 gigabyte quad channel
memory kit now this is actually one of
the largest boxes I've ever received for
memory being shipped to me and so that's
kind of impressive I guess but shiny
g.skill logo on the top this is quad
channel memory it's actually designed
specifically for Intel LGA 2011
processors and x79 platforms however
that does not preclude you from using it
in a different platform such as on a se
mainstream until like Haswell processor
or something like that or even maybe on
an AMD anything with dual channel but
the quad channel XMP settings are going
to be a little bit more suited for x79
so that's what I'm using it for should
be good to go
on the side here you can see the G
skills including a lifetime warranty
which is about as good as it gets as far
as warranties go as far as I'm concerned
model number on this one specifically is
f3 - 1 9 2 0 0 CL 1 0 Q - 3 2 GB zhd
which makes no sense well it kind of
makes sense but um it's actually a 4 by
8 gigabyte kit and I went with so much
memory because I do video editing video
editing requires many many many memories
but on the side here you can see they
put the stickers for all 4 dims that are
included it's one point six 5 volts
castle 8 + C 10 and actual timings of 10
12 12 31 here is an accessory that's
included from g.skill which I'm not
planning on using just because I find
that my memory runs cool enough most of
the time anyway but this does have a
couple fans on it and little clamps and
actually provide you with two of these
so you can put one on either side if
you're going with the quad channel setup
because the DIMM slots aren't two
opposite sides of the actual where the
processor socket is you do have kind of
a sleeved cable here molex plug I would
prefer if I was going to be critiquing
this even though I'm not going to be
using it but this had a three pin header
rather than just plugging it straight
into molex but like I said I'm not going
to use it anyway but hey looks pretty
cool in box number two surprising
enough we have another one of those I
already said you get two but there's
your confirmation two of those included
and then the memory itself is underneath
these cardboard things which is upside
down awkward to get to but I think I
think I can manage
all right you have some documentation
here on the turbulence to fan that's
included that you guys are free to pause
and read if you really want to users
guide and then the memory which comes in
these little pouches okay and I nearly
forgot this little accessory - which is
a G skill Aggie geese a G skill case veg
I sometimes call it G skill but that's
just kind of my pet name for the company
but some case badges are cool and here's
the memory itself I'm only gonna show
you guys one of these but trust me
there's four of them see there's the
other three they all look exactly the
same
now the Ripjaws e series has sort of a
lower profile heat spreader I wouldn't
say a low profile because there is some
some bling eNOS up on top that provides
a bit of additional height which if you
really are worried about clearance you
might want to look at something else as
far as what the heat spreaders they give
you are but aesthetically they have a
flat black PCB on the memory which I
really like because I appreciate the
aesthetics and especially when I'm doing
YouTube videos I like things to look
pretty and it has XMP 1.3 ready so if
you have an Intel motherboard or if you
have an AMD motherboard that supports
Intel XMP profiles you can load those up
and it will automatically set it to ddr3
2400 with the timings in place which is
in my experience the easiest way to get
a memory set at the proper speed and
frequency this is certified actually an
asus intel x79 based motherboard so
that's kind of nice if you're looking
for certified and actually tested memory
asus worked with g.skill to do that they
are all black for the most part and
that's kind of why I went with these is
I wanted them to blend in and just about
any situation there is a blue ripped
Ozzy logo there and I was actually kind
of on the fence about that actual
sticker I don't really know how much
it's going to end up bothering me once I
get to build together but let me know in
the comments if you guys think that the
sticker is okay or should I pull it off
or should I try to like do something
over it so it removes the blue because I
don't know how much blue there's gonna
be in the rest of my system but apart
from that I suppose that about wraps it
up for this video
we'll say that I've been using GCL
memory and quite a few systems for quite
a while now
and then one of my favorite memory
manufacturers because I think they do a
really good job with their memory and
I've never ever had a stick of g.skill
memory die on me but that's all for this
video guys if you enjoyed it go ahead
and leave me a like don't forget to
