Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool hey
guys I'm over at main gear at the
Cosmopolitan and they have a new they
have the perfect computer so you guys
don't need to build computers anymore
because main gear made the perfect one
it's called the f 131 it has a new
cooling system called apex so let's take
a closer look so here's the F 131 and it
is completely kitted out and what main
gear has done here is they have
completely designed their own chassis
this is an update to the existing
chassis but they have specifically
designed it to integrate this cooling
unit over here which is called apex more
on that in just a sec but let's first
take a look at the system itself this is
a fully kitted out version so if you
want to buy a system that's based on
this chassis you can get one starting
around $1,600 if you want to jump up to
a higher end liquid-cooled system it's
probably going to start more in the
$4,000 range and go up from there
main here is definitely not inexpensive
but you do get a lot for your money
including just some incredibly well done
work internally they have some amazing
system builders who put these all
together and of course if you buy a main
gear system you're going to get full
support so if you have any issues you
can just contact them whether it's a
driver problem or whether you're just
worried about how you're going to drain
your loop or anything like that they
also have service plans that you can
purchase as well so this system as setup
has an 8700 K 960 pro SSD at four nvme
and dual 1080 T is down there at the
bottom this is a random thing to point
out here but I like their i like their
pci express extensions they're actually
kind of pretty and they're all black but
anyway beyond that of course full custom
sleeved power supply and in fact power
supply sits behind the apex unit right
there now because they've designed this
specifically with water cooling in mind
it means that they have proper mounting
points for all of the heavier water
water cooling components that you might
need to install and it also means that
they have fit this in a really narrow
footprint so it's a it's a little on the
taller side but the trade-off is of
course very narrow from side to side and
if you have a smaller desk then you can
of course set that right
on top of it and got plenty of room
still io is right up here on the side so
very easy to get to power button of
course three I'm sorry four USB 3.0
ports and also a USB type-c and that's a
3.1 gen2 port so you get your 10 gigabit
per second connection right there let's
talk a little bit more about this apex
unit now if you get the F 131 you can
get it water-cooled without the F 131
and the water cooling upgrade is gonna
run you about 500 bucks the F 131 on top
of that it's going to be $2.99 and they
are actually considering making this
available to system builders I'm so not
system builders but to you guys at home
who might want to build your own system
this is something that you really can't
do if you're just building a system at
home even if you're getting really nice
custom water cooling parts unless you
got a CNC mill at home or something like
that you're not going to be able to put
together something like this that looks
this clean evens details such as all the
angles are all the same they're all
going the same way at the same angle so
that lends to the overall cleanliness of
the build
they've even internally added baffles to
the points so that your outputs your to
liquid outputs here are going to be
delivering liquid at the same flow rate
to your GPU and your CPU at the same
time and that's definitely a concern if
you're setting up the custom loop and
you're splitting it now the apex itself
has a bits power pump that is sort of
fitted in the back there should it's got
dual pumps so it has a failover and
that's another thing that you're not
necessarily going to get if you well you
can build your own set up that way but
getting something that's this compact is
very difficult
these are DDC pumps so they're going to
be nice and quiet the system that they
have setup here you can just you can
barely hear at all and then furthermore
down at the bottom they've added at the
lowest points in the loop a drain or
bleeding loop so you can easily drain
the system if you want to replace fluid
or if you're using some fancy Mayhem's
fluid like they have here and you don't
want to leave it in there all the time
being able to easily drain your loop is
pretty important all the liquid cooling
is fed up here to the top radiator that
goes across the entire top of the case
it's a 420 millimeter radiator and ask
them about filling and it can actually
release the top of the case and it kind
of hinges at the back and you can lift
that up
a little bit so you can get in to the
fill ports that are on top of that apex
unit as well lastly there's also a
temperature sensor integrated into the
apex and that is a great solution if
you're setting up a water cooling loop
like this especially depending on what
you're doing if you're gaming you might
have your GPUs getting hotter if you're
doing video rendering or something like
that your CPU might be getting hotter so
being able to adjust the pump speed or
that kind of thing based on the
temperature of the fluid is actually a
great way to go with a water cooling
setup so the apex is definitely a pretty
amazing unit that includes a reservoir
dual pumps Phil oh did I mention the
flow indicator gotta have a flow
indicator too that's that's what liquid
cooling is all about I got the drain
port pumps and it's all a very very
clean looking unit and of course slots
right into the f1 31 as you can see here
and I almost forgot but there's also an
integrated LED strip that runs down the
side here so you can swap that out
it's RGB by default but for example you
could do a fancier LED strip in there if
you wanted to switch out to maybe an
addressable LED or something like that
or possibly even UV I thought that
system over there was UV but it's not
it's just it's green fluid with blue
lighting on it so of course main gear is
all about customizing your system
whatever you might happen to want to put
in it they'll work with you to put the
hardware you want to get to a price
point that you want to work with and
they just have a few other examples here
of just some amazing setups this one is
a black system with gold accents they
have black Mayhem's fluid in their gold
fittings white LEDs bear in mind also
that all the LEDs on the case our RGB
capable so your main gear logos up on
the front as well as the LEDs in the
case will all sync up together they also
have a ton of custom paint options
they're showing me this one here which
has a new method they're using called
mark 2 which basically allows you to
take a design they just have sort of a
fractal or I don't know what you want to
call this design here but just some
geometric patterns that they have
implemented onto the side of the case so
you could actually send them over your
own design if you want to to have
applied there they also provide an
automated
automotive paint jobs as well so that's
a really cool feature this one's just a
nice clean white finish with some blue
as well as some RGB going on inside and
then over here is a great example of one
of their custom automotive paint jobs
it's kind of difficult to see with the
lighting but depending on the angle that
you look at it it kind of shifts between
black and purple and almost red which is
actually a really cool effect and again
these are automotive paint automotive
quality paints so it is a little bit
more expensive but they said they have a
guy who does previously did painting on
supercars and that kind of thing so
you're gonna get a really high quality
finish if you decide to go that route
finally here's a look at the main gear
and HP collaboration HP s their omen
chassis and main gear takes it and
basically kits it out with an incredible
water cooling setup they're using all
straight runs here oh if I didn't
mention by the way if you're setting up
at f1 31 you do have the option of going
with hard line or soft tubing so that's
a nice option as well but over here we
can see some really clean straight runs
in this blue accented build and the HP
omen which is just again the system's
they brought here are really nice also
they wanted me to point out these are
not necessarily showpiece systems that
they've put together just for CES this
is the exact same quality that you'll
get if you actually go ahead and buy a
system from main gear but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for my coverage here at
the main gear suites at the Cosmopolitan
stay tuned for more coverage from CES
