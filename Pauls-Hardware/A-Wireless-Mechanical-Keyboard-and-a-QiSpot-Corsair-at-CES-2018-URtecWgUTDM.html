Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool all
right guys we are visiting the Corsair
now as we always do at Computex and CES
yes now and they actually invited us
over to a press conference this morning
which is very nice they served us some
they weren't danishes but they were
breakfast pastries they were quite
delicious they also have some new
products so let's check that stuff out I
wonder what they think of them of course
Arab sitting on a 500 D papers on a very
important phone call so for starters
course there has wireless everywhere and
they wants everything to be Wireless
that they make and so that means
keyboards mice and I guess mainly
keyboards and mice but the k63 wireless
mechanical keyboard is what they have
launched today cost one hundred and ten
dollars he also comes in a different lat
board forum at the k63 wireless
mechanical Latin board you can buy them
separately and get the lap board
additionally for 60 more dollars or you
can get them both together save yourself
ten bucks and it's a hundred and sixty
for the lap board version now the unique
thing about this is that it's Wireless
and it connects in three different ways
you can do a 2.4 gigahertz wireless
connection and that is the fastest and
best connection for gaming it has a one
millisecond response time which is about
a millisecond faster than any other
Wireless Keyboard of this nature before
it also has a Bluetooth connection
availability and that's really nice if
you want to take it on the go and
connect it up to a laptop or something
like that you're not going to get quite
as good of a response time it's about
7.4 millisecond response time with
Bluetooth connection but it's still nice
to have that as an option you can also
just plug it in via wired USB if the
battery happens to die and you
absolutely need to use your keyboard so
that's a really good set of options for
connectivity
it's got 15 hour battery life with
maximum LED brightness and the LED max
brightness is by default is 66% you can
go into the Corsair utility and actually
increase that all the way to a hundred
percent but in order to keep the battery
life better
they maximized it out of the box to 66%
you can turn the LEDs off of course and
that will greatly increase your battery
life to 75 hours so some options there
it's got perky blue LED
lighting that's controllable via the
corsair utility engine software and it
also has a cool feature that's 128 bit
aes encryption when it's in Wireless
mode that does add a tiny bit of latency
about point zero 4 milliseconds so you
go from one to one point zero four but
if that does happen to bother you if
you're a professional gamer or something
you can disable the AES encryption as
well the LAT Board version has a memory
foam cushion on the bottom at a
full-size mousepad so you can use it to
game in the living room and this is only
going to be available with cherry MX red
switches at launch but they said as in
the past based on consumer response they
of course will be open to adding
additional Cherry MX options in the
future to pair with the keyboard you
have the dark core RGB wireless gaming
mouse this also connects in the same
three waves 2.4 gigahertz Wireless with
1 millisecond response time Bluetooth or
via wired USB bear in mind that each
individual device you connect via that
2.4 gigahertz connection will require
its own separate USB dongle but you know
that's not a huge deal but you do need
that in order to maintain that really
low response time 16,000 dpi pick start
sensor that they custom built for
Corsair and it has a nice contoured
shape that's a bit different from some
of the Corsair designs we've seen in the
past has a textured bumpy palm rest and
in my brief testing with it it was quite
comfortable has 3 controllable RGB LED
zones and up to 24 hours of in use
battery life which is pretty good for a
wireless mouse it costs $80 just by
default or there is a dark or RGB se
special edition that features qi
wireless charging and that's actually
pretty cool too because you can pair
that with the MM 1000 qi wireless
charging mouse bed the third new product
that Corsair is launching today now this
mouse pad costs $80 which is a lot for a
mouse pad but it is a bit more than a
mouse pad because it has a wireless
charging Qi spot and if you can find the
cheese spot well then you're already
ahead of the game but if you have the
dark or RGB special edition mouse which
costs $90 to $10 more than the normal
version you can of course park the mouse
on that Qi spots rub it right on there
and it will charge and it only takes
about a couple hours to charge which is
pretty nice in fact they said it charges
just as fast when parked on the Qi spot
as it does when plugged in directly B as
a USB so that's pretty impressive for a
wireless charging method you can't
charge other Qi compatible devices on
this cheese spot so if you have a cell
phone for example that has wireless Qi
charging Park it right there and it will
charge up or they actually come at it a
little dongle and you can use that via
the plug and it's got three types of
plugs USB mini-b
type C as well as a lightning connection
so you can plug that into a phone that
doesn't have wireless charging and then
you can use that to charge your phone
right there on the cheap spot as well
but chances are you're going to want to
save that cheap spot and only park your
dark or RGB wireless mouse on it the
next product if we want to move away
from peripherals is a power supply the
new Corsair a X 1600 a power supply
which now becomes of course there is
best power supply ever supplanting the
former champion the ax 1500 I and if
you're like me and get really excited
about power supplies like this then you
probably can't find the g-spot but
anyway this power supply is going to
cost you four hundred and fifty dollars
and yes it does supply sixteen hundred
Watts versus fifteen hundred watts of
its predecessor but it is more efficient
in fact they're featuring gallium
nitride transistors in fact John was
very excited about the gallium nitride
transistors I don't blame them they have
increased efficiency versus silicon
transistors and it actually has better
than 80 plus titanium and fish'n see
ninety-four percent at minimum but
actually can go up to 99 percent
efficiency absolutely crazy depending on
the load that you have on the actual
power supply itself of course has
digital monitoring via Corsi Corsair
link just like its predecessor and it's
200 millimeters long which is fairly
long for a power supply but that is
twenty millimeters shorter than the
former ax 1500 I and that's part of that
gallium nitride transistor thing because
the gallium nitride transistors can also
be smaller now beyond the power of this
power supply it's also pretty sexy
looking and if you want to make it
sexier or just make it match your case
they have swappable magnetic ID plates
for the side so it's got a gray label on
there by defaults but rather than
peeling that off as we often recommend
you can just take these little magnetic
plates there's red white and blue and
just swap it on instead I think the only
way they can make this power supply
better would be if they included this
really cool white cable sleeve cable set
by default I don't know if we can talk
them into that or maybe it'll make a
special white edition of it that maybe
they could do that to they've done that
before made a white power supply moving
on
just a couple more products Corsairs of
course very well known for their
closed-loop liquid CPU coolers and
they're introducing a couple more to
their lineup in fact these were
previously introduced back at Computex
but they're actually bringing them to
the market now so you can buy them the
age 15 I pro and the age 50 I Pro now
both of these new CLC's have a
360-degree RGB lighting ring around the
outside and an aluminum trim trim to
pump cap that I think looks pretty cool
of course their logo on top also of
course lights up in RGB and you can
customize that by connecting it to the
Corsair link utility and of course you
can also use a course so I'll link
utility to monitor stuff like your fan
speeds and your water temperature and
that kind of thing ultra low noise
Corsair maglev series cooling fans are
included they have large high-density
radiators 360 millimeter for the H 150 I
Pro and 280 mm meter for the H 115 I Pro
and these are the first Corsair hydro
series coolers to feature a zero rpm
mode so when your CPU isn't hot enough
or whatever you have connected to the
closed-loop cooler the fans just won't
spin and that's a really nice option for
super low noise especially if you're not
using you not using your computer why do
the fans need to spin just sucking air
through and getting dust and things that
kind of thing finally these also feature
the brand newest 6th gen ace tech pump
and this is new and from what they tell
me it is quieter and hopefully we can
test that in the future to see if that
is actually true now finally coursera
had a couple new cases they were showing
off the one that is available now for
$100 it's the corsair carbide spec omega
and then they also had a new obsidian
500 d that I thought looked really cool
had a tempered glass side panel as well
sort of a curved tempered glass front
panel which is very challenging to do
they were talking about how the
manufacturing of that curved front piece
was actually pretty difficult I'm not
going to go too much into details here
because while I was at the Corsair suite
Dmitri a neighbor from hardware connects
are there and you know they go all out
when it comes to case videos and they
were getting all sorts of really cool
footage of the 500 D and I was like you
know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna
tell people to go to their videos so
that's what you guys should do I'll say
I'll find their video once they post it
and put a link in the comments or just
go over to hardware connects and check
it out because Dmitri Dmitri and Eber do
a really good job with that stuff and
they can have all the gritty details on
that so everything I've talked about
today except for that 500 D case is
available right now you can go to the
Corsair store and buy
directly or they should be available at
retailers soon as well
but guys that's all for this video and
in case you hadn't noticed I I really
relocated back to the hotel room because
it was a little crowded in the course a
suite but definitely hit that thumbs up
button guys if you enjoyed this video
and of course one final shout out to my
sponsors for CES 2018 ocz toshiba deep
cool enter Max and coolermaster more
videos coming very soon so of course
subscribe as well if you're not already
thanks for watching guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
