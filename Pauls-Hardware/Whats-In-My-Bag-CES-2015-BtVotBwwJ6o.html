by fractal design and WD to learn more
about their products and to say thank
you for supporting pauls hardware go
ahead and click on the sponsor links in
this video's description hey everyone
and welcome to my first video of CES
2015 this is the video where I'm
actually not in Las Vegas yet but I
think you'll still be interested because
this video is all about what I'm
bringing with me that's right
what's in my bag actually most of the
stuff isn't in my bag right now let me
go ahead and fix that
so here's everything that I'm planning
to bring I'm sorry if it doesn't look
very organized trust me it is I actually
have two bags that I'm gonna be filling
up right now my camera bag over there as
well as my laptop bag right over here
and apologies if the audio quality has
just gone to be kind of crappy because
my zoom h1 that I usually use to record
audio is one of the things I'm bringing
so I'm just using any camera audio on
the canon 5d mark ii right now which
incidentally I'm not bringing on the
trip this is my swiss gear backpack this
is my laptop backpack I've taken this on
quite a few trips already and I think
it's absolutely fantastic because it got
the space for the laptop back there and
if you got Scott ton tons more pouches
and everything to fit all the other
stuff I'm sorry I don't know
specifically which model that is but
they don't really list it on the bag
very much themselves either so that's
their loss I guess second bag here is my
actual Canon camera bag this one's
fairly inexpensive I think it's only
like 40 or 50 bucks from Canon this one
actually has all the separators inside
if you have a DSLR or something like
that so you can see it's pretty empty
right now so this is the bag which is a
bit smaller so I'll be taking this onto
the show floor and out and about with me
whereas the laptop bag is gonna probably
stay back the hotel room with the laptop
and the stuff that I don't want to carry
around all day you also might notice
that I removed two can low go from this
bag which was right there cos that's
kind of like a steal me sign moving out
to equipment though I'm going to start
out with my audio recorder here a couple
things to bear in mind as I'm showing
you this stuff one is that I am
completely on my own this year I do not
have anyone going with me I'm shooting
everything myself I'm talking to the
camera myself and I'm also going to be
doing all the editing myself while
they're at the show now I'm not doing a
ton of videos so I should be okay but
these are my two primary recording
devices so we've got two zoom h1 on the
Left which is for audio I have a little
windscreen that goes with it and I like
this little mic because it's so portable
it's got built-in storage so you just
pop in the card right there and then you
have tons and tons of storage
protip tape over these switches because
they're easy to switch and accidentally
move yourself from mp3 to wave mode or
that sort of thing it's got a separate
line in so I can
and actually do a separate mic input
into this and use it just as a recorder
if I want USB can be used to set it up
as a microphone for a laptop or like
it's a standard computer or you can use
it to transfer straight from here if you
don't want to pop out the memory card
and then also you've got a line out so
you can actually monitor the audio -
it's a really nice little compact
recorder and actually I'm just going to
be using the included built-in
microphones on here for most of what I
do because they actually do a really
good job that's what you usually hear
from me although I do try to keep this
position pretty close to my face as I'm
talking now the other thing about this
is that since I'm recording audio on
this I need to synchronize it with the
video that I record using my camera and
the camera if you guys didn't watch my
last video is the Panasonic Lumix Alex
one hundred this is a ultra compact to
some degree it is pretty substantial for
a compact camera so it's not quite as
small as like on rx100
or one of those but it does shoot in 4k
it has a really nice lens the other
thing is that as far as audio goes
that's one of the drawbacks from this
camera doesn't record very good audio
that's why I'm doing separate audio from
the zoom h1 but that is why the next
thing I'm going to show you is some of
my workarounds for how I'm going to be
recording separate separate audio with
the zoom h1 recording stuff with the
camera being able to record myself at
the same time and also making it look
somewhat reasonably good for you guys ok
there's one other thing I need to show
you here with the LX 100 because it's
going to affect how I record things and
it's also pretty cool so if you go into
the menu here this actually has built-in
Wi-Fi so I'm gonna hit that and then
what I've done is I've taken my older
cellphone the lg optimus G here and I
have basically set it up to use it as a
monitor for this camera once it
recognizes the Wi-Fi network these are
both going to sync up and basically it
lets me use the phone to control the
camera which is cool for a number of
reasons primarily being oh the lens cap
is on yes so primarily like if I turn
the camera around I can as you can see
my camera updates with what it's seeing
so I can get a live view of what's on
the screen so yeah one of the cool
applications of this is that
I can point it up myself and still be
able to see myself as I'm recording
myself this is really weird by the way
because I'm recording a video of myself
recording a video of myself recording a
video of myself that's pretty meta okay
but anyway as you can see it's fairly
awkward to hold both of these so I did
come up with a solution there are a
couple solutions to hopefully work
around that so for the what's in the bag
over here on the camera side the camera
bag side let's start off with my
assortment of tripods or at least sort
of tripods I also need to say big thank
you to mano price in this video because
although they are not a direct sponsor
of my trip this year they did send me
over some cool stuff to try out so we
have the monoprice Robo pod here which
is kind of a beefy a little mini grabber
tripod which you can angle to attach to
certain things I'm going to bring this
but I'm not probably gonna be using that
primarily because I found this little
flexible guide to work pretty well this
little mini tripod is one that came with
my zoom h1 accessory kits it's just
small and portable and useful for if you
need to set up a quick camera on a table
or something like that or a audio
recording so I'm gonna bring that along
as well this one right here however is
the mono price flexible tripod and as
you can maybe tell I have modified it
because what I want to be able to do is
walk around with my camera and be able
to position that zoom h1 to point
towards me at any given time so I have
totally get a rigged basically the shock
mount from my rode videomic in order to
hold the zoom h1 that's what those
that's what those rubber bands are and
then I've totally like ghetto zip tied
it to the edge of this to one leg of
this little flexible tripod now trust me
this is actually a fairly effective
solution as I will show you in just a
moment when I actually set it up and do
a demo I want to move through the rest
of what's in my bag first up before I
show you how I'm going to be filming
stuff so stay tuned for that the end of
the video or if you're impatient just go
ahead and skip this does have a little
quick release plate at the top so you
can pop the camera off which i think is
very nice and a little mini ball head
also and then of course it's a tripod so
you can make the legs flexible and
they're kind of squishy - which I like
so you can set it up wherever you want
to wrap it around things I've also got
these magic arms over here J actually
introduced me to these magic arms I'm
going to bring them all the
don't think I'm actually gonna be using
them at least the configuration I have
setup right now I don't need them
I just have them as a just-in-case or
maybe if I do a bunch of selfie stuff
I've got a smaller one and a bigger one
and then I've also got a little clamp
that you can use to clamp to something
and then it's got like little quarter
inch threaded holes in there so you can
attach other camera gear to it but
moving right along here we've got some
screen screen wipes from Canon those are
very nice to have this is also some lens
cleaner which I've never actually used
before q-tips of course a little lens
pen these are fantastic it's got little
brushes on one side so you can easily
clean off stuff or if you've got
something more gunky on this side it's
Kabul polisher so you can use that to
keep your lenses clean of course bring
both of these cellphones I've got the
new Nexus 6 still working on the review
for that but then I have also got my lg
optimus G which I'm using as a monitor
for the lx100 when necessary of course
we're gonna need power so I've got my
charger for the lx100 I've got one
battery already in there and then I went
ahead and added when it and hadn't
picked up another another real actual
battery battery life on these is really
great and I think with two of these I
should be able to film all day without
issue I also got a separate little
camera bag here this is a what is it a
low pro camera bag because I needed
something a little bit bigger for the
lx100 this is a nice soft interior it's
got some space in there for some memory
cards this little guy fits in there just
nicely and then I'll be able to hang
around I'll look I'll probably kind of
do you see looks like a hip bag but it's
functional and that's really all I care
about
that's pretty much the what's in the
camera bag stuff as far as a camera gear
for recording although I do have an
extra camera and this one right here
this is the mono price action camera and
it's kinda like a GoPro it's made for
like outdoor use and stuff like that
it's really easy to use but it records
1080 it's a quite quite a bit less
expensive than a GoPro and I'm mainly
going to be using this to get like shots
when I'm like driving in the car or or
things that I may be a little bit too
nervous to use the lx100 for now for the
action camera I also got this from
monoprice this is basically like a
selfie stick compact
camera extender is what it's called that
you can extend that out and then down on
this end it has a standard little
quarter-inch camera mouse and you can
sort of angle that around moving right
along though we have some battery
backups of course I've got one from
monoprice here that's an 8000 oh and our
one that one right there that actually
belongs to my wife I have a feeling
she's going to steal it that's ok cuz
I've also got a rose bulb one right here
this one is a thirteen thousand milliamp
hour so that should be just fine for
recharging my phones if need be
for additional power because I need a
double-a battery for my zoom h1 so I got
a bunch of those I've got some nine
volts of course I have this card the EZ
card in case I need to take the subway
in Taiwan I don't know why that's there
that was an accident okay also we of
course are gonna need digital storage
for recording things so for that I've
got a 64 gig samsung SDHC I've got a 32
gig samsung SDHC got another 64 gig look
how tiny that is how small it is that 64
gigs right thing so I can use that with
the adapter honestly I'm hoping that
just with the standard 64 gig right here
I should be fine for all of my footage
since I'm not recording in 4k but I'll
have backups and then of course I need
micro as micro cards for the zoom h1
usually I have a 2 gig which recording
with mp3 version works just fine but
I've also got this g.skill 16 gig that I
can pop in there if I actually do start
to get low on space also got flash
drives these are USB 3 and they're
really fast HyperX one is a little bit
faster than the Voyager GT but I like on
both 64 gigs each and that's just if we
need to transfer data around between me
and other people who I'm gonna be
filming with they're rooming with or
whatever take syndicate route perhaps I
can copy straight to my laptop via that
card reader but I have this one which is
USB 3.0 if I needed to go a little bit
faster this is like a 12 or 13 dollar
purchase from Amazon though and it
doesn't every once in a while it drops
it's not as consistent as I would like
it to be so I might just use the
built-in of course we can't edit well we
can't edit on a laptop but we can't with
just the trackpad
so we've got the Razer DeathAdder right
here which is kind of my standard
traveling Mouse we've got additional
storage here in a couple SSDs so I've
got a 500
SSD that's in the laptop these are both
250 or 240 or 250 gig SSDs with this
little adapter here which is USB 3 which
makes them great as working drives and
they're still really really fast and
I've edited in this manner before I've
got to swim in it back I have a backup
and just in case space runs low I can
switch back and forth between those and
in case you're wondering this little USB
3.0 adaptor actually came with the WD
black squared drive but I've been using
it for this purpose and it's fantastic
my laptop is the Asus g550 JK which has
been doing a great job at least it has
since I updated this upgraded the
storage because it shifts with the
mechanical Drive but I've got a 500 gig
SSD in there instead these are some
v-moda headphones which are overpriced
in my opinion however they do go over
the ear and do some good noise blocking
so they're decent for that I like taking
these on the road because they have this
nice little traveling case I've also got
some Rosewill earbuds in there which are
also pretty good for noise blocking and
travel and if you need to listen to
something and block out outside noise so
be able to use either of those for some
more storage on top of those SSDs and
the internal storage it's on here I've
got a WD in My Passport
err this is a one terabyte drive and
this is the one that's made for Mac's
I'm actually gonna have a good time
reformatting this for for PC here's some
cables of course USB micro cables I've
got a USB on-the-go cable here in case I
want to transfer stuff straight from my
phone to like one of those flash drives
over there I don't have any fractal
stuff per se
now the fractal is a sponsor I really
didn't have much use for most of their
products on this trip since it's like
power supplies in cases and coolers and
that sort of thing however this is some
fractal swag that they gave last year at
CES as you can see it's got the fractal
design logo on it although it's made by
iShare I might use this depending on the
situation if we have a wired Ethernet
connection at the hotel you can plug
that in right here and this can become a
hotspot so you don't have to use the
crowded hotel Wi-Fi which is kind of
nice it's also got a built-in battery
charger I think it's only like three or
four thousand milliamp hour but nice to
have it's got a card reader so my card
reader totally fails I'll have the
backup there I'm not getting the feeling
that this video isn't gonna be
longer that I originally planned but I'm
gonna plow through because this is all
important stuff that I'm gonna get find
use for powerstrips this is my rode
videomic and as you can see I've
completely removed the mount because I
reuse that for the shock mount that I
built on my little tripod flexi tripod
over there I'm still going to bring this
as a backup and that's why I also have
nine volt batteries in case you're
wondering have some miscellaneous stuff
that I'm also gonna be bringing though
because this just good it's just good to
have screwdrivers there's all those
little cool screwdrivers it has philips
and then you can pull it out and it's
got flat head in the other side I also
got a microstrip your screwdriver kit
that I got in my stocking for Christmas
I have playing cards because we're gonna
be in Las Vegas I have a water bottle
not the WD is my sponsor or anything now
this is was actually sent over very very
graciously by WD as part of a little
Christmas swag box that they sent which
is super awesome but I'm gonna be
bringing that using it because it's an
ice water bottle you should always have
a water bottle I got some meds going on
here if you can't tell I'm actually
suffering from a little bit of a sore
throat and a head cold but that's okay
if you're going to see us try to get
sick the week before but be better by
the time you go to CES that way you'll
have really high blood cell count that's
that's my strategy this is just a first
aid kit it's got some bandages and stuff
in there we've got a friend in case the
nose is stuffed up we have this oh my
gosh my wife got me this stuff Vegas is
so so dry at this time of year cold and
dry so we have some enriched hand cream
that's gonna be fantastic
vitamin C for increasing the immune
system's ability to immune system and
some daily facial moisturizer again my
wife got me that some Advil of course
for if you've had a long night maybe and
then lastly we have some snacks I'm
excited about these though apple pear
strudel Clif bars I've got some jerky of
course that's important I randomly grab
these these are from last year and they
have little LEDs there Rose will scent I
have just put these in here I don't know
they're just attention grabbers maybe
I'll find it I'm gonna make a place to
use them let's I got some gloves just
because I how cold is gonna be and these
have little things so you can still use
a touch pad on your phone that's kind of
nice
a note pad impendence that's always
useful don't forget your CES badge okay
that's important this is actually last
year's I'm going to be picking mine up
on the show floor we have a bottle
opener for opening fine bottles of wine
or other vintages or probably more
likely beer bottles and then I'm
bringing all these cable ties as well as
some of these velcro straps because this
is my wife put these in my stocking this
year which is why she's awesome but I
have a feeling I'm gonna make use of
them so I'm bringing some of those long
as well and this is that monoprice
action cam this is gonna be camera B
again this is just made to be really
simple to use so it's got a wide angle
lens on the front you can use this
button to take pictures you can just
slide the switch forward and back to
start and stop recording its mate so you
can use it like with heavy gloves and
stuff like that and on the back there's
a little lock on this panel which pops
off and then you can access the internal
such as a HDMI out a little card reader
which is where I'm going to put my
memory card and card slot switch between
HD and Full HD presets and then of
course a little USB out so pop that in
there and I can start using it so your
setup number two and this is probably
gonna be my main setup when I'm
wandering the floor and whatever I'm
using the flexible tripod from monopod
monoprice and there's my ghetto rigged
zoom h1 there on the corner now there's
other ways I definitely could have done
this if I had there's actually a little
quarter inch adaptor that I know I have
and I search my entire house for and I
couldn't find but I don't know they're
just gone so this is why I went with the
solution with the zip ties right here
holding that little piece on and then
this has an actual shock mount so the
rubber bands are keeping it from making
contact with the rest of the little
setup here what this means I can do is
when I'm recording I can kind of angle
this back towards myself although I need
to I should always go clockwise so I can
twist this around so point it back
towards myself to capture my audio a
little bit better or I can twist this
around forward so that if I'm recording
something and I need to capture what's
what's being said or somebody's talking
or anything like that I can do that and
or I can go for something in between and
then I can angle this leg since it's
slowly flexible to point it wherever I
want and then the last thing that I
really like about this setup is if I'm
somewhere where I have say a table to
sit at and interview someone or
something along those lines I can still
use this as a monopod and lastly here's
my kind of also somewhat get a rigged
solution to doing a selfie cam if if
that becomes necessary so I've got one
of my little magic arms used back here
just connected to the camera the other
end of it is going over to that clip
that is holding my Optimus G and then
I'm using the Wi-Fi feature with the
camera so that I could theoretically be
pointing this up myself and recording
myself I know there's a ton of glare
down here on the screen but this is what
the camera is seeing right there so if
you're filming yourself you could make
sure that you still had everything in
focus and that everything was still
framed up nicely and looking good but I
suppose there's still one last thing to
do even though this video has gone on
much longer than I originally
anticipated and that's just to see if
all this stuff will actually fit in my
bags
well looks like I'm all packed so I see
you Nate</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
