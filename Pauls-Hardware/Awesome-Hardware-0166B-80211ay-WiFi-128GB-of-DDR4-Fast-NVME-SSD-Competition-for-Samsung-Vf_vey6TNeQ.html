curious I look there see that's loading
more thumbnail kinda sorta I mean that's
better new the side video sighted baby
that's good maybe that minute just
actually started broadcasting right now
and we are broadcasting to YouTube
that's entirely possible but we're
really not sure but I want to pretend
like it is working so alright hi
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
this is a live show with stream every
Tuesday evening we talk about technology
computers gaming pcs mostly and we do
occasionally use adult language so a
quick word of warning there we do also
drink a beer on the show feel free to
join us with join us if you are drinking
responsibly and are of age of course and
things are a little bit shaky right now
because YouTube during Kyle's half like
Kyle started broadcasting his half I
broken up this show which is episode
number hundred and sixty-six now on his
channel bit wit and then YouTube broke
so Kyle obviously was responsible for
that my phone YouTube still is
apparently broken but over here xsplit
has allowed me to initiate the broadcast
and it says we're broadcasting so maybe
this will work in the future I doubt
we're getting any live viewers but we do
have live viewers on Twitch because we
do also broadcast to twitch at the same
time twitch.tv slash slash awesome
hardware so if you guys are with us live
thank you so much for being here
yeah and if you want to help support our
shows and if you like the content that
we create on YouTube and twitch and
elsewhere check out our stores Pulsar
right on that is my store you can buy
things shirts mugs pint glasses and it's
all good and yeah I don't have too much
more to say about it
bit wit that tech is Kyle store and you
can also buy stuff there if you buy
stuff during the show we will give you a
shout out during the after party and
anyone who bought anything on my half of
the show your Johnson will be coming
during the after party yes yes and we
will not forget you
as well as the donation comments any
when you donated in super chat although
how the hell when YouTube was working
yeah I mean I did see some dope yeah so
there might have been a few that came in
earlier on I want to keep refreshing
YouTube as we go here to at least keep
an eye on yeah boy whether or not that's
working but each so it goes I suppose
alright let's proceed with some news I
don't have a whole lot of news to talk
about and most of my news is not so good
very good news very useful hatred news
you guys are gonna find it's very
edifying so first off the Intel Core i
$9.99 hundred k is launching a few days
here so which bullets i was gonna
there's so much blood
gonna grab this i haven't got one you
don't have one of them stole little
salty
Calvi intel flew you all the way in New
York and they didn't for their launch
event obviously they must have sent you
one of these they said they'd never
arrived so obviously people who work in
my building stole it
I've reached out to Intel alright until
if you're watching get Kyle his 900k
please please anyway though I didn't do
anything wrong
there's only limited information we're
allowed to share about the 9900 K until
the embargo lifts me which is on Friday
that has been publicly acknowledged by
Intel normally when there is an embargo
or an NDA on a product we're not
necessarily supposed to tell you when
the embargo or the NDA lifts sometimes
it's okay it kind of varies but once
it's made public information then it's
public information so a little bit more
on this platform though in something
that was published in a non tech an
article by eating cut-rate Ian Contras
and all my articles leaked down in this
video's description
you gotta check it out on YouTube so
these are new memory modules which are
the survey tall rate tall memory modules
Adak yes and there's a couple companies
that are producing them oh those are the
32 gig modules yes so HP and Intel has
not confirmed actually support for these
on this new platform
for the newest 9000 series processors
9900 K 9700 K and 9600 K you should at
least come December be able to use these
new double-height DDR DIMMs which are
the very tall they use up more space but
that shouldn't be a problem if you're
using something like an all-in-one
liquid cooler or something like that and
it allows support for basically twice as
much memory his was supported before the
kind of interesting thing about this is
that HP actually came out with it first
and that Intel was kind of forced
because HP had told them that their
mainstream desktop platforms are get a
ship with 32 gigs of memory onyx and are
expandable up to hundred and twenty
eight gigs until then it was contacted
by a non tech and they confirmed yes
these mainstream processors will support
these new types of memory dims main
stream processors prior to now only
support it up to 64 gigs two memory
channels with two dimms per memory
channel and only 16 gigs per dim but now
there's two new technologies
double-height double capacity 32 gig
ddr4 modules this is one from tzaddik
tzaddik and g.skill has also announced
them with the trade NZ RGB DC which I
mentioned stands for double the capacity
short right and it makes sense sensible
not just the double height double
capacity 32 gig modules though but also
16 gigabit ddr4 chips from Samsung so
fans of you guys either would I don't
know if there'd be dice but either way
it doubles the capacity of memory so now
have two hundred and twenty eight gigs
possible for 32 gig dims not even gdt
yeah well that would match what you can
currently do in the high-end desktop
with 16 gigs in dims and the high-end
desktop and eight memory slots you can
do a hundred and twenty eight gigs
currently but they have not confirmed
anything beyond the new 19
9900 k9 700k 9600 K no report on whether
this will be supported for like 8000
series processors nothing on whether it
will be supported on the high-end
desktop officially if it is the high-end
desktop would be able to support up to
256 gigs of memory which would be
exciting for certain people who use
After Effects a lot or something rich
yeah and who are rich because obviously
this would be very expensive memory is
one of the most expensive parts in the
computer among the top three at least
and at four by four at four by sixteen
gig kit right now if you wanted to max
out 64 gigs right now it'll cost you
about five hundred and fifty dollars for
a full kit of ddr4 2666 so Anandtech
speculates that a 4 by 32 gig kit could
easily cost double that or sometimes
even more because you know when it's the
fastest or the best of the most capacity
capacious you know it costs even more so
1200 to $600 $600 is what they
speculated or three hundred to four
hundred dollars per memory module okay
well they can have a memory module that
costs just a single one that cost just
as much as like a 8700 k baby Jesus that
interesting thing to talk about I wonder
if they're gonna do CC with this as well
cuz I need to swap out memories well
that is one of the main reasons why
they're doing it is for smaller form
factors so you can have two dimm slots
with 32 gigs of memory installed yeah so
who knows maybe alright moving on though
from memory to storage or SSD storage
there's a couple SSDs that would come
out I like SSDs because they're fast and
everything and there's two SSDs that are
just out launching and both of them are
interesting for two different reasons so
I will share that with you this is the
SSD review who did a review on this SSD
haha Corsair for series MP 5 10 MP 500
has already existed from coarser the MP
510
shown in this picture here is a new one
and it's using a phase on PS five zero
one two dash E twelve eight channel nvme
controller this is apparently a
controller if you read the article it's
a very it's a very exciting controller
because it's there's just a lot of
potential match it up with some real
fast flash memory and have a very fast
SSD which is kind of what Corsair has
done with this one
the MP 510 supports the latest nvme 1.3
protocol and it's available in 240 gig
480 gig 960 gig and 1920 gig capacities
the one they tested was the 160 gig or
roughly 1 terabytes they found for
example it is a dual sided m dot 2 Drive
which means it's got chips on both sides
of the PCB which you know isn't unheard
of but it's less common there's a
close-up of the actual controller the
memory is Toshiba 3d BICS 64 layer TLC
NAND flash
speaking of Toshiba friend of the show
yeah the ICS flash hey there you go each
of the raw value of turning 56 gigs at
least on this one and they peel off the
sticker which is why I can see it says
void right there there in a bunch of
tests though and it's very fast and the
reason I bring this up is because it's
actually fast and certain tests it's
very comparable or competitive with
Samsung's like 970 Pro 970 Evo
I'm sure currently like the fastest nvme
SSDs so you've got a little bit of
competition here from Corsair with this
drive three thousand four hundred and
eighty megabytes per second read in
there testing three thousand megabytes
per second rates 610,000 read I ops and
five hundred and seventy thousand right
I apps that's I believe four KQ depth 16
or kita 32 testing that they're doing
also has a five-year warranty and
supposed to be available right now
although not currently listed on Amazon
but here I just moved the camera day in
here off we'll fix the camera just above
a thing it's supposed to be two hundred
and forty dollars for the 968 version
though one hundred and twenty five
dollars for the 480 gig version $66 for
the two hundred and forty gig version so
66 bucks for like a really fast nvme SSD
for I'm 240 gigs is a ton of space but
that would be a very nice like operating
system drive or even hundred and
twenty-five dollars for the 480 gig
version that's that's pretty nice too
good although I believe these
performance what's scared scaled down a
little bit depending on the capacity
that you got the one terabyte version is
240 Dan they're coming down Bryce yeah
so so that's like hotcakes and actually
the article that's nice wood grain there
in the article there's the actual chart
here where you can see waiting for
crucial to come out with an nvme end up
to you ya know price for the two
terabyte version yet but you can see
like you get a pretty decent drop in
sequential reads though like from 3,000
to 2,000 to 1050 so the 960 gig is kind
of the sweet spot when it comes to
capacity as well as performance nice
alright next SSD because that said there
was a couple and this is our article
tech gauge by our boy Rob this is a
crucial nvme SSD and crucial is very
popular manufacturer of SSD they do
other stuff too but they do a lot of
really popular SSDs that are like very
fast and very reasonable way I thought
you were talking about the crucial SSD
this whole time and now as your ser
Jesus Christ okay I'm with you on to
crucial this is the p1 series
significant mainly in that it is crucial
first nvme SSD and if you're into like
SSDs and you like the speed of SATA like
jumpin up tenant nvme especially like
the convenience of MDOT to and being
able to just slot it into a motherboard
you don't need to
about cables running power to it or
anything like that that's super nice so
crucial x' p1 is available in a one
terabyte and a 500 gig version it's is
currently available available on Amazon
yeah look right there one terabyte for
220 dollars 500 gig version for a
hundred and ten dollars looks like it's
pretty much all black so you know good
on them so that should match and all
that good stuff and speeds are pretty
decent too not as super fast as the
Corsair force MP 510 or like the Samsung
min 70 pro but still two thousand
megabytes per second reads and seventeen
hundred megabytes per second writes for
the one terabyte version and then
nineteen hundred megabytes per second
reads and nine hundred and fifty
megabytes per second writes for the 500
gig version so again the rights the
rights tend to drop off for a lot of
these just because typically it's
because the controller on the SSD can't
but when they reduce the capacity they
remove chips the controller has a
certain number of channels you remove
one of those chips then suddenly it's
not able to take advantage of all the
channels they can use at the same time
that's not always the case but it
commonly is yeah pretty reasonably
priced for this one too and cool that a
little bit more competition in the space
especially since prices have come way
down
moving on Qualcomm has announced 60
gigahertz 802 dot 11a why why Wi-Fi
chips yes a why but why 802 I love an a
hoc bring in 5g speeds with wire
equivalence latency or so they say no
which is nice bullshit so these chips
which are available now should
significantly improve wireless
performance via the 802 that 11 a why
standard delivering 10 plus gigabit per
second network speeds wirelessly oh
excuse me ya know if you follow our show
you might have remember when we talked
about the Wi-Fi Alliance renaming all of
the 802 dot 11 variations to Wi-Fi for
Wi-Fi five and Wi-Fi six for example
Wi-Fi six is a tornado 2.11 a xy5 five
is a toe 2.11 and I believe so I don't
know if this a why is gonna be Wi-Fi
seven or anything like that Qualcomm is
just just going with the old naming
scheme instead of the new one
these chipsets are not intended for home
routers though they could end up in
virtual reality and augmented reality
devices so that's kind of interesting I
don't know it's like headsets or
something like that there's not a whole
lot of detail on like the actual links
here anything they say why are cool why
are equivalent latency but then I guess
that would make sense I mean a chair
wireless agent yeah but there there's
also some limitations though but the
support here of course is for this 60
gigahertz millimeter wave band and they
also support the existing Wi-Fi
standards 2.4 gigahertz and 5 gigahertz
but the advantage of this millimeter
wave sixty-year it's Wi-Fi is that there
is not much interference on that
bandwidth to slow things down but the
disadvantage is that 60 Hertz waiking is
a short-range wireless technology and
it's not that great at penetrating
obstacles like walls so again something
you might see being useful for something
like a Riviera Wireless VR headset where
you're in an enclosed room or something
where you the whatever is broadcasting
wirelessly to the headset is you know
line-of-sight or something like that so
maybe we'll see what sort of devices
this technology is integrated into soon
because the chipsets are available today
but of course it's up to third parties
to integrate them into products that
they might bring for sale cool next up
you know we we've talked a little bit
about the verge I'm on the show before
Kyle well I never smile every mile did a
video and you know they cut along the
ridge got a lot of flack um you know in
the past month or so because I heard
made a video about making building a
computer and and and you know maybe some
of it was
deservedly so but I thought we'd try to
make amends and maybe give The Verge
another chance going back and seeing if
they've brought things back to some
hard-hitting technical content so uh-oh
what's going on over there okay what do
we got uh Apple has fixed its new bagel
emoji with cream cheese and a dough your
consistency what it's riveting article
by NYX stat as we can see here Apple's
emoji for the bagel here on the left
Wow dry crusty obviously not like flavor
going on there look on the right though
you know the bagel itself has been
bulked up it's got cream cheese ice
cream cheese a nice even layer of cream
cheese applied beneath you know and this
is really the content that people go
into the verge you're looking for the
image guided by emoji PDF this was first
spotted by Jeremy Burch of emoji pedia
of course and it is this is literally
about a bagel emoji this is the most
significant update to anything that
Apple has come out with this year I
think I think is what this boils now you
see before and after as I can see
Philadelphia Cream Cheese with the
relevance but actual so I'm it's so
basic I'm confused is this really an
article about bagel emojis yes okay
Apple innovation and it's focused the
verge on the cutting edge of journalists
all right moving up really noted yes
please
as previously mentioned my half is gonna
be slightly on the shorter side so
YouTube still down apparently YouTube
still being streamed to with no issues
apparently over here so it says we have
no viewers is that right
but hopefully YouTube is still receiving
us if not I will have to do extra work
tomorrow to pull this off of twitch and
post on YouTube but that's fine all
right we have a quick sponsor spot to
share with you guys
there she goes and sponsored awesome
hardware for the month of October
raise your hat and we of course thank
them for their support you sure do and
in exchange we are sharing a little bit
of information about some Toshiba
products with you guys it's kind of how
sponsorship works what we have are SSDs
and we like SSDs because they're very
fast and responsive storage devices
Toshiba has a type of flash memory
called BICS flash it is pretty fast and
it's also not terribly expensive to
produce which means they can make
products based on it that are reasonably
priced and also very fast as flash
storage is concerned what Cal is
unboxing right now is the OCZ RC 100
which is a little MDOT to nvme SSD you
get over a thousand megabytes per second
read and write speeds on this tiny of
the local MDOT 220 240 to drive I
believe it's the length of it there so
super small and compact kind of cute too
but also quite fast they've also got 2.5
inch drives like the TR 200 available
here so if you're looking for a storage
standard that's a little bit more widely
compatible are you just looking for
extra storage like use this for your
operating system Drive and then use this
for like all your games and stuff like
but yeah links to some Toshiba SSDs
based on BICS flash technology are down
in this video's description so check
those out thanks again to to thanks
again to Toshiba for sponsor we got some
hard work you can find links in the
description of my YouTube video that's
currently not active or - oh yeah yeah
totally that's assuming you - nature
ever recovers I mean it's possible
YouTube has just given up then we're out
of a job and just yeah I mean I guess
I'll have to figure out something else
to do freaking out right now
time to go be a full time twitch
streamer I know there's no video there's
people benefit is that we now have 1600
viewers on Twitter cuz everyone's
migrated from the non-working you to
look at this we regular hi it's a record
high pretty high up there on the talk
show list at this point and have you
noticed that the the twitch delay is
only like three seconds it's so quick
that's awesome
I wonder if it has anything to do with
like I don't know maybe twitch is like
it's time to leave mark may shed maybe
this evening was like the moment of the
twitch ambush on using like they they
they somehow sabotage YouTube yep
and at the same time they made their
shit like all all hooked and that's
what's going on now anyway though let's
move on this isn't the sponsor spot
anymore elses sword fight oh sorry
that's right sorry fight is where Kyle
and I take up opposing sides and to
argue about stuff typically it is very
controversial or stuff that people are
arguing about so a big thank you to cell
processing our awesome moderator like so
we love you that today we're posting
some links to this pretty strong if you
guys want to go ahead and render your
vote on that straw poll please go ahead
and do so or or you can wait you can
wait listen to our arguments patients
that have zoomed maybe that will sway
your opinion in some way you might first
off though and we talked pretty
extensively about the RT X 2070 launch
which was today while the I'm sorry the
launch is actually tomorrow
the embargo lifts for reviews
performance reviews was today so
tomorrow October 17th you're supposed to
be able to buy r-tx 20 70s at retailers
like online retailers or whatever for
500 theoretically
according to Nvidia because they were
very very strict about making sure that
$500 versions of the r-tx 20 70s got
into reviewers hands what is the opinion
of people today on the eve of these
becoming available will you actually be
able to get an RT X 20 74 or $500
tomorrow or like beyond you know the
first five minutes that they go up for
sale or however long it takes for them
to sell out also we're not sure you know
as far as the quantity that will be
available tomorrow if it's a huge amount
or if it's you know just enough to get
some stock in to say that was for sale
we got a few options here Cal and I
usually argue between the first couple
of them but you know feel free to cruise
if you want mmm okay I feel like the top
two or the ones we have to argue over
yes indeed um and I'm gonna say damn I
feel like there's always you know it's
never black and white with these types
of things so I'm gonna say yes there has
to be i I wish I could scratch out the
idea promised part um that's the a
little bit of editorial in every answer
I think really stings a little so my
theory is that you will be able to buy
in RTX 2070 tomorrow for $4.99 or
whatever because NVIDIA has probably
learned their lesson to some degree
they've learned their lesson a little
too late in my opinion where you know
people have given them so much shit from
the r-tx 2080 and 20 atti launch and how
you weren't able to buy either of those
cards on launch day for the prices that
were suggested there's actually still
Kansas you still can't 2080 I for sure
you can you still can't and I feel like
Nvidia is trying to say faced by almost
enforcing maybe retailers to Nvidia
is everything like their their control
freaks they always have been and they're
really starting to show their teeth now
for this launch in particular and I
think they're gonna force Adam board
partners and retailers to sell at least
some cards for $4.99 on launch day at
the very least I think that's gonna
happen
now how many exactly exactly what are
you arguing for me now Paul because
that's exactly I was gonna say is that
they're gonna sell out really quick
because there probably aren't gonna be
very many at all that are selling for
that price and the vast majority of them
that you know 99% of people will be able
to actually buy are gonna be grossly
overpriced well beyond $4.99 what's so
the 20/80 supposed to be seven $6.99
$7.99 yes yes base and founders Edition
yeah so cheapest is 790 on PC part
picker for gigabyte windforce version
almost a hundred bucks on the suggested
starting price so yeah available for so
I'm not confident at all and it is it is
available and in stock at new ache for
790 dots so available yes but at the
founders Edition price not only not the
not the fake entry-level price that they
try to tease people with all right so I
think NVIDIA is just kind of like you
know they're gonna you know if people
give them shit on launch day it's like
well we really have any cards you know
for $4.99 at least nvidia will have
something to point to be like hey look
we had five r-tx 2080s in stock for
$4.99 we told you guys that we would
have some of these cards for that price
on launch day so technically we weren't
lying it's just it's just very far off
from what you were expecting but you
know we held up our end of the bargain
which is why there's there's no black or
white here their promise is a lie your
move so you are saying yes there will be
there will be but that's not a good
thing okay that's not a good thing
it's a
that's not the whole story then there
will be but inventory will be severely
limited no one will be able no one will
be able to buy so that's a great
transition because that kind of means
you're arguing for my answer which is
that no way the five hundred dollar
cards are vaporware or you know at bests
again like a few stock here and there
like nvidia sent out this requirement to
the manufacturers that all right you
guys have to make this happen you know
you don't have to make it happen
everywhere and then I have to be widely
available it just needs to happen enough
that you have some of these cards to
send to the reviewers and that there's a
few available in stock here and there on
launch day after that after they sell
out don't worry about it produce your
your $600 cards and focus on those and
you know we'll probably never see a $500
RTX 2070 again I can see this happening
and I will actually be pretty irritated
if this happens this is actually
something I'm gonna watch and I could I
I can kind of feel myself on the verge
of making a video about being angry
about it because I would feel personally
tricked because with all the reviews
that went up today and this is something
that I addressed in my video like I
heard something that I hadn't really
heard before which was that there was a
bit of a not a restriction but a
requirement I guess you can call it a
restriction for the reviews that went up
which is that nobody who covers an RT X
2070 should not have a $500 version of
the card everyone who covers the r-tx
2070 should have the $500 version of the
card and if they're covering the RT X
2070 they have to cover that 500 dog
version of the card and then you can
also cover other versions too but like
it's time savvy and it starts off with
that base level requirement of cover in
that which i think is also misleading if
the $500 cards are available come
tomorrow and stay available in ample
quality in their reasonable quantities
right now for the next few months or
through the holiday season we didn't we
can resume then I'm more okay with it
because then I covered a card that
people can buy yeah if it didn't if
they're not if they sell out immediately
if Nvidia pulls the same crap that they
did put the GTX 1070 they make where
they were like three hundred and
eighty-nine bucks there's three hundred
and seventy-nine bucks whatever the
entry-level price was for that right and
it was at least fifty dollars more which
is a which is a decent chunk more at
that price point and it was you know it
was it's it actually hasn't even been
until just recently that you could
actually buy them for that cheap right
as the price prices came down after the
mining craze subsided but if that's the
case they're making us reviewers look
like assholes because our viewers are
our reviews are based on a $4.99 card
that we're projecting to the world and
no one can buy it for that price and
it's making us like say these things
about a card that doesn't exist it
doesn't exist and yet in videos telling
us will like review it as if it's this
as if this is the reality that's not the
reality so that's no until launch after
our reviews go live in my review the
only way that I felt I could be fair
about it was to say here's a five
hundred dollar card and here is a
hundred dollar card and they each have
their own bar graphs you know that they
each separately so you can look at that
$600 card and say here's what you get
and it's overclocked in whatever and
it's like more representative of the
potential performance of the twenty
seventy GPU that's at the heart of it
versus here's what you get for five
hundred bucks and if you're not someone
who's ever gonna overclock your GPU or
something that's all you get for five
hundred bucks because you're gonna be
sticking with the base frequencies and
everything so anyway point being I will
be somewhat curious tomorrow to see how
things go
but that's also kind of why I wanted to
ask this question tonight - so people
think in this time of uncertainty
alright we have one more question but
let's see the results for this one first
and everyone says no everyone agrees
with me everyone is cynical that they
don't trust in Vidya 500 cards will not
$500 cards will not be available over
half 55% and that's with the inclusion
of full dummy answers Wow Kyle really
playing doubles ever since trust public
trusted Nvidia like I have no idea if
anyone from Nvidia are associated with
Nvidia ever watches this show but I mean
that's 30 30 34 people work for Nvidia
that's not good 34 people work for in
you know I mean maybe you don't care cuz
certain products are gonna sell anyway
and maybe I mean that's okay I guess I
mean it's a business that's a business
decision Oh
Sumer is wrong for voting this way if
the r-tx 2018 2080 launches proof
complete otherwise like or prove the
same thing that despite their promise of
a starting price of X amount we saw none
of it and and had zero fucking
availability so whatever control Nvidia
is able to exert over this launch if
they're doing it in a way that could be
perceived as consumer friendly it would
be allocating a lot of these twenty
seventy GPUs to be $500 versions if they
did that and with a significant amount
of those then they'll be available for
500 bucks and some of the people who
voted and said no way and that's not
gonna happen might look and be like oh I
guess I was wrong or you know they
actually did do that I feel like given
all the negativity that they've caught
because of the pricing they've gone with
for the twenty series launched so far
that is like the one thing that could
you know bring it back ever so slightly
but again and number two response here
and this is something that I you know it
was very intentional for me to include
500 bucks on a graphics card is such a
crazy amount to spend for so many people
for such a large portion of the people
who are considering building a gaming PC
yeah and and I feel like even with even
if in video does have a bunch of having
a dog
the fact that the discussion has become
this bubble of like 500 to $800 cards
that people are talking about versus you
know a lower down bubble is it's kind of
a success for NVIDIA because they've
already raised the price point in
people's minds and I think that's why
they so heavily focused on r-tx like
they were trying to convince us that we
needed something we didn't know we
needed yeah like our TX you need it in
your life it was like that Tom's
Hardware article do you really want to
be on your deathbed and you know your
life flash before your eyes and none of
it be rate raced like like you're
bringing up a point that no one's ever
humanly thought about before and you're
trying to make it like all of a sudden
it's this essential necessity to life
like no one needs any of the the fluff
that comes included with these cards
that right now isn't really even
included with these cards
it's the teller trying to justify the
price and like I like we all suspected
no one's buying it both literally and
figuratively all right next question
for sword fight is specifically about
awesome Hardware now as you guys may or
may not be aware like about a month ago
ago or so we sort of made some slight
changes very slight changes to awesome
hardware's format and I just wanted to
ask this question sort of to get a
little you guys and also of course argue
amongst ourselves as we always do about
how successful those changes have been
so of course we have a wide variety of
options here for any responses from
adequately successful all the way up to
extremely successful and I'm imagining
you guys will be able to choose your
response in the meantime though okay
what do you think extremely successful
Paul okay I was about to say you went
first on the first time so I'm just
kidding now just kidding us no it was
but you know you're obviously going to
pick extremely successful I'm gonna go
with very successful very successful cow
and I'll say why we used to do an after
party in the first I don't know gear 2
of the show there was I don't want to
say we were consistent but there was
some amount of regularity you know there
was at least a decent chance it was
gonna happen and that fail fell off and
it was understandably so from our
perspective because awesome hardware is
a show that takes a decent amount of
planning beforehand we try to read up on
the articles and have some notes so we
can kind of go through it in a somewhat
punchy fashion going through all that
finishing and then going you know one of
us going home and then jumping back on
for another gaming stream while often it
was fun it's also like still a stream
and so you know it was very tiring for
us so we eventually just kind of cut
that out now though with this new format
the the the after party is a little bit
more built into it mm-hmm so you know
obviously there are a few people who
have said that you know they like the
old format better for this reason or
that reason but I think we've made a
couple changes couple additional slight
changes to hopefully accommodate those
people too and I think for that reason
it's been a very successful change and
we do the the after party more
frequently we look forward to the after
party more often and the show itself
when we're paying attention is a little
bit more concise and direct and
to-the-point yes Kyle I am saying
extremely successful for all the reasons
you've just listed bullshit yeah I mean
you basically crafted my entire my
entire argument you keep arguing I'm
gonna grab thank you thank you so much
please do um yeah I mean I think it's
been extremely successful I call me an
optimist but I feel like we've we've
kind of you know I think that there
needed to be some sort of progression
from the place where we were and
the fact of the matter is not everyone
has the time to watch a two to two and a
half hour or even three hour livestream
people are busy people have their lives
and you know the world doesn't revolve
around Paul and I ooh
Newcastle thank you very much and so I
think by keeping it more concise and
slightly shorter more people are able to
join us live we get that greater
interaction from live chat than we have
in the past because more people are able
to tune in and and even the rebroadcast
you can't catch a slide either way can
still enjoy the rebroadcast because it's
half an hour per side instead of an hour
to an hour and a half much more
digestible what the fuck is guess I
think all the glass away agrees so I
think it's been extremely successful I
think maybe very successful is accurate
for for right now but I think in the
long term I think long term that it will
eventually be the extremely successful
change that we've been looking for for
quite some time very very
forward-looking
yes I'm confident thank you okay let's
see what everyone at home thought how
successful have these slight changes to
awesome hardware show format meant let's
let's check the results looks like most
people said I did not realize there is a
change meaning the changes excuse
excessed by blending in seamlessly like
in in general we also very successful
adequately successful and and yes there
there was there was a thinly veiled
negative answer if anyone didn't didn't
say that they didn't like them we got 11
percent of the votes and again guys we
do appreciate the feedback I'm happy
that it seems like the vast majority
people are happy with it on some level
and I don't see it I was about to I was
about to say something that something
that might happen but I didn't want to
promised anything you didn't want to be
a pulling invidia so like I have to
imagine that there is some software or
website or something somewhere that can
pull a twitch stream and just just just
make the audio into a podcast right I
have is Aleve that's a thing cuz that's
what we've been asked that's the one
request that I feel like I've gotten
most on the show there's people who are
like I just listened to it like I put it
on you know because that's long-form
content that's what it's very useful
people put it on and I listen to it
while they do something else and I'm
flattered that anyone would want to do
that with this stuff yeah we're saying
right now so I feel like if we could do
that if we could take the twitch stream
part of it just the whole thing and feed
it into a podcast on a weekly basis
mm-hmm
then it would then I feel like everyone
would be satisfied anyone who wanted to
just watch the bits of the that are kind
of more tech news could do that if you
watch the after party it's still linked
there we watch the whole thing you can
you just want to listen to it you can
too but like I said that's something
that I've only thought about I haven't
actually done yet twitch leecher
is that a thing twitch leecher twitch
leecher
says memento mori let's look into that
perhaps okay but guys that's gonna wrap
it up for my half of the show as as
theoretically stream to youtube this
does say that we're still streaming to
YouTube so I'm gonna cut the YouTube
right now and thank you guys if this is
streaming properly to youtube we're
watching and again links to everything
is in the description including a link
to cows have the show
assuming that worked properly or maybe
YouTube is just dead forever maybe we're
gonna continue with a bit of after-party
cow actually has even more content
planned for that I do you see yeah your
submissions will be heard we're gonna
read over some some donation comments
since and Johnson's another but for now
thank you guys so much for watching and
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
bye YouTube bye it's the first time
we've cut YouTube and like</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
