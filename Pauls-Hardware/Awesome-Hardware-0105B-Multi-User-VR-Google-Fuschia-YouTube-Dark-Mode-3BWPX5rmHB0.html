happened start the show ah you poke
someone's I am no thank God I'm wearing
glasses hey everyone welcome welcome all
to awesome hardware the live show the
cattle and I do every Tuesday evening at
5:30 p.m. Pacific time we are on the
second half right now of episode number
105 so we're on side B if you missed the
first half side a it's on Kyle's channel
bit whit's it's linked in the
description and we've had a good time so
far we talked about technology we've
drank a little bit of beer yeah
not a ton of beer no reason to be
reasonable bet Amir I did I did another
beer you watch part one Sunday if you
want to watch fall trick a beer you
chugs it very quickly
I did I did it I did a reasonably good
job chugging that beer but I'm still
maintaining so you stand strong you're
leveled bro okay wish I got more water I
don't have any more water yeah just keep
drinking beer you don't need to like you
need to live anyway though a quick
warning we do cussed sometimes and talk
about adult themes from time to time
nothing terrible but bear that in mind
and we're mostly going to talk about
some tech news today and then the second
half of my half of the show is going to
be pretty loose pretty open we're going
to answer some questions and all that
good stuff so thanks to any guys who are
watching live right now whether you're
on YouTube or whether you're watching on
twitch TV / awesome hardware we greatly
appreciate you being here if you guys
want to help support our channels then
feel free to buy some merchandise oh
yeah my website is Paul Sartre brunettes
and as you can see I have shirts and
mugs and pint glasses some polo shirts
some beanies as well all very high
quality quality merchandise the pub
glasses seem to be very popular today
that's I'm drinking out of one of those
there they're awesome and feel free to
buy them and if you buy them during the
show we'll we will shout out your name
at the end and it will be wonderful
Kyle's store is bit width tech slash
store he also has a selection of shirts
and some mugs and glasses and a hoodie
yeah she's just all super nice just in
time for summer
yeah just suggest in time for summer all
right we're going to start my half of
the show actually that we always do we
always do tech news at the end of the
first half and the beginning of the
second half so that's what we're going
to continue this transition yes so you
don't even know what's happened so well
planned out so if you guys weren't
already aware I've talked in the past
couple shows about net neutrality I'm
going to kind of continue to do this as
the commentary cycle continues I'm going
to try to make it shorter and shorter as
people are more and more familiar with
the issue as it goes on but most
recently for net neutrality and here's
an artist Technica article Ars Technica
article talking about John John on the
head Oliver
John Oliver this is also why I shouldn't
talk about this on the second half of
the show when I've had a few years
catching up with you but John Oliver who
does last week tonight's show has
tackled net neutrality once again just
like he did about three years ago
towards the beginning of a show so if
you guys haven't watched this I highly
recommend it
if you don't like John Oliver for
political reasons I understand
and pull it there's lots of reasons to
be politically active for various
reasons these days I would say please
try to try to look past that for now
because this really is an issue that
affects everyone there's an FCC comment
period open right now because the FCC is
proposing to remove the net neutrality
rules that are currently in fact in
effect those rules are in effect because
internet service providers are
classified as title to common carriers
by the FCC I'm going to read this
comment because I think it's pretty good
at sort of explaining the situation it's
a promoted comment from the article Tom
xp for when one says here's what bugs me
about this whole thing the American
people have spoken and the overwhelming
consensus from all sides this was in
2014 and 2015 by the way when this first
came up was that we want the government
to Anne
force net neutrality this gave the FCC a
pretty clear mandate to do exactly what
they did when title 2 was invoked and
net neutrality was enacted which the FCC
had to do the FCC tried to do it by just
creating rules and Verizon sued them and
they had to roll them back so the only
way they were able able to actually
enforce net neutrality was to classify
ISPs as title 2 as common carriers under
title 2 of the 1934 ads it's an old back
to the from 1934
anyway we said with a strong clear voice
that fast lanes slow lanes and corporate
censorship are not to be tolerated and
the FCC listened neither neither pie nor
anyone else can say that this is in
America's best interest when America
told the FCC exactly what America wants
quite frankly I am still amazed that
this is even even under consideration
we strongly agree with you and John
Oliver and the folks at last week
tonight have made it even slightly
easier to comment on this if it's
something that you feel strongly about
and honestly you can comment it on on it
one way or the other by and large the
people we speak to are for keeping
things as they are
they want to keep ISPs classified as
title to common carriers so that net
neutrality can be enforced by the FCC so
if you want to tell the FCC that go to
go FCC yourself calm ha ha
which will basically take you through
several of the steps that you need to do
on the FCC website to get to the
commentary page granted the FCC website
has been unstable especially in the past
couple days since John Oliver posted his
video on last week tonight and there's
some conspiracy theorists out there who
have said maybe the FCC website is done
because they don't want more people to
comment who knows a lot of us actually
think that it doesn't matter how many
people comments and what they say FCC's
still going to do what they want to do
anyway
but it's important to speak up right now
so that in the future when they're like
we don't care what people have said and
what people want we're going
whatever we want to do you can be like
you know what most people didn't want to
do that so and beyond that it goes into
voting and all that kind of stuff but we
leave it at that because again I'm going
to try to keep those segments relatively
short but really really strongly
encourage you to some rewrite their poem
- well thank you I'm trying
last week was a bit rough around the
edges sighs just trying to be slightly
slightly better this time and at least
point you guys in a better direction
okay next up on tech news GTC is going
on this week the g-force technology
conference which is an event that nvidia
puts on every year here's a pretty
interesting device or fancy-ass computer
that they're demonstrating here which is
a multi-user VR setup here's not
extrovert right that's fun yeah that's
pretty sweet
this is build here has four Quadro p6000
GPUs which I think I should double yeah
Quadra p6000 which I think are fairly
I'm going to double check how much these
costs at retail right now but four of
those altogether which gives you four
independent outputs to connect up your
VR things that you might need to connect
these headsets yeah your headsets and
HMDs and and all that good stuff Quadra
p6000 why is just giving me a UK website
why it's 4,000 euro though shopping
we're around for how much just a Quadro
p6000 oh we have seven thousand dollars
so depending on where you go the 24 gig
each of these cards cost five to seven
thousand dollars so we can say we can
say that so obviously not an inexpensive
solution but do you need these cards to
do multiplayer GNote VR no you don't but
their workstation GPUs each one is
connected to an HTC vive Business
Edition headset and this is sort of
being marketed by Nvidia as like hey
here's a solution that you could deploy
in various situations to allow people to
all be running VR off of the same
machine to potentially be in a
collaborative environment where they all
work together
so each quad
in this system is running a virtual
machine on a server which allows each
vr-2 or each VR user to act
independently so hvr gets their separate
instance of a virtual machine operating
system where they can load up their
games and whatever and play the gamers
though when they're actually playing
cannot be tracked by the same
lighthouses so that's kind of cool so
they can all be in the same area
together you don't necessarily need
multiple lighthouses or anything like
that to track them so they can move
around in the same space and as the
article points out there's lots of
different implementations of this or use
cases where it could be useful office
environments for collaborations of like
people who are in different spaces
around around the world potentially
something like that just a sort of
virtual meeting environment or something
more simple like that but eventually
obviously gaming is a huge potential use
of it but also educational facilities
amusement parks and our Cades
specialized gaming situations that are
you couldn't potentially get at home but
you might go to a you know an arcade or
something like that to play in also
military and manufacturing industries
could potentially have uses as well
although the article doesn't elaborate
on how those industries might make use
of something like this all in all though
kind of kind of interesting the couple
points brought up by the article and
actually I thought of these myselves
myself even before the article pointed
out but some issues with the current 8
head-mounted display VR solutions that
are available is like tripping over
wires because obviously you know a lot
of wires coming out of this thing and if
you have four people all working in the
same environment that could be an issue
running into or hitting each other as
well multi-user collaborative VR
environments are still I believe in the
sort of infancy stages right now so I
don't know how that would be handled you
should in a VR environment be able to
see the other person who's there with
you and whatever be our space that's
created but obviously there might be
issues if you're playing a game and
trying to use a weapon where you're
swinging something around or something
like that then that could be a problem
but
hopefully something like that would be
able to be worked out I actually saw a
video and I think this was something
random that I stumbled over on Twitter
and I don't I couldn't find it I spent
several minutes of my increasingly short
period of time I had to plan the show
before we went live trying to find this
video but it was people who were playing
it it was a VR environment the video was
using augmented reality so they're doing
the thing where they're recording the
people playing live but they were over
overlaying the actual VR environment as
well and they were playing a multiplayer
game where they were all jumping around
and like you know putting their hands
out in specific ways like shoot shoot
you know beams of energy at each other
and stuff like that and it was a really
cool video it's very stylized they
obviously edit it all together and stuff
but it was a cool example of maybe what
something like this can be used for and
I'm sorry to give you guys all that
description without being able to
actually point you to where that is but
who knows maybe somebody in chat knows
what I'm talking about that's cool
remember last week we were talking about
the future VR and what you know these
smaller startup companies are working on
to improve HMDs and just the whole VR
experience and we talked about TP cast
how they've already released their their
wireless module to go completely
wireless and then they're currently
working on the same sort of thing and
upgrade to that that would allow you to
do wireless play with multiplayer
potentially locally okay so with me I
don't know if you could use that in
tandem with a system like this or you
know a similar setup where you could
have a bunch of like three or four
people in one large warehouse or like a
large room wireless not tripping over
each other's wires and having free range
to to play together and collaborate on a
in a VR environment however I kind of
wonder for wireless solutions like how
much just because there's so much data
that needs to be communicated very
quickly with minimal latency between the
source you know the host and your and
your actual head mounted display and
everything like how quickly does this
wireless spectrum that's available get
crowded with
different connections that are going on
and everything you have not little
signals at the same time yeah ends like
that I'd be curious about that but yeah
cell also pointed out in chat that he he
would pay money to see us do the Star
Trek bridge simulator Star Trek
Oh Star Trek bridge Star Trek bridge
simulator which Steve has always been
has sent us several Steve was really
early on that he he sent it to us way
before it actually went out and there's
several I think youtubers who have gone
to us like a specific location where
they've tried out the Star Trek bridge
bridge simulator but yeah that would be
that'd be cool trail I wouldn't mind
trying that at all I like I like
pretending like I'm in Star Trek who
hates to do that all the time all right
uh so speaking of VR let's segue right
into this next story Vasia you guys
familiar with Vasa the mounting standard
for monitors and things like that TVs
well visa is actually the video
electronics standards standards
Association okay so it's an Associated
video electronics standards Association
so yeah
wanted to enunciate that so yeah they're
an association that has helped
standardize quite a few different things
we often hear the term visa because we
say oh it has a base amount but that is
the result of the Vesak group's efforts
at standardization across lots of
different manufacturers okay because
standardization can help both
manufacturers and consumers in a lot of
ways so vase is now looking at VR
virtual reality as an emerging market
and a place where they feel like some
standardization could do some good so
they said just to give you guys a little
bit of history it is very well known for
DisplayPort the best connection still in
my opinion even though HDMI 2.0 is out
I still like DisplayPort better also
embedded DisplayPort which is very very
commonly used in laptops for a
connection between the screen and your
graphics card on the laptop also they
previously defined long-standing IDI at
the eated standard extended display
identification data which is a standard
for the communication of data between us
a monitor and its source that is used
and works with vga hdmi and displayport
so and maintaining the integrity of an
Eden signal is the reason why sometimes
when you're using a splitter or
something like that it doesn't work
because part of that also goes into
stuff like digital rights management and
that kind of thing but I don't to get
too far off topic here anyway basically
oh and also of course the holes on the
back of your monitor and your TV
standardizing that basis standard mount
sizes for mounting different sizes of
displays the reason there's a ton of
different mounts you can buy and arms
and swing arms and all that kind of
thing that all just work with whatever
monitor you happen to have as long as it
has a standard base amounts it's because
of ASA standardization toros now I sail
that's to fluff up this story because
honestly there's not it's been beyond
that but due to the rapid growth and
also the fragmentation of the augmented
reality and virtual reality markets
vases said they really need to need some
standardization the lack of
standardization is causing compatibility
issues between products from different
vendors as well as increasing the
complexity and cost of development
ownership and replacements but with a
standardized this is the same no it
doesn't I mean that there's a few things
so I mean like the size of NH MD or like
the actual viewports you're using what
they're saying right now is that the
developers who are developing these
products which is primarily right now as
far as products have been brought to
market
HTC with the vibe as well as oculus with
the rift they've been focusing on
creating an end-user experience that is
you know tenable for VR environments
which they've done a pretty good job
with if you get a rift or you get a vibe
you can do VR and you can put and you
can do it like even if you are
susceptible to motion sickness or that
kind of thing like VR works and it's
very fun and you know granted there's a
pretty significant barrier to entry
still because you need a high
NPC and a headset solution that will
cost you between five and six hundred
bucks just for that by itself but it
works but basically avais is saying is
that we need to introduce some
standardization to this to allow for
replacements so I don't know like again
I'm not really sure what they're talking
about specifically if they're talking
about like replacement you know
interface connection between your face
and the device or something like that
maybe not something like cutting you
mean or I don't I don't know I'm
speculating yeah I'm throwing out
potentials here could be connections for
the hmd because another difference
between the rift and the end of I yes so
it could be a universal way of
connecting it it could be create it
could be even creating a new standard
for a single connector between a headset
or you know if we're if we're ignoring
the potential for for wireless
connectivity or something like that
but a standard a standardized connection
so you can plug it in to your computer
and plug it into your headset and you
don't have to worry about separate
connections for power and video and
audio yeah so there's potential for that
and that's the end of the story okay fun
let's move on to talk about Google
fuchsia
you should fuchsia those rights google's
fuchsia is a smartphone OS yes a new
smartphone OS and if you're like wait
doesn't Google already make operating
systems the answer would be yes this
would be the third operating system
after Android and Chrome OS and fuchsia
was first talked about back in August so
this is a new news but what is new is
that there's actually you I know that
people can sort of look at and mess
around with a little bit so the mobile
OS yeah so it seems to be designed
specifically for for mobile devices
and in fact the so the operating system
is based on a completely new microkernel
which is called magenta it is not linux
based at all
it's open-source in real-time and the
operating system is licensed under a mix
of BSD Clause 3 MIT and Apache 2.0
magenta is targeting modern phones and
modern personal computers with fast
processors non-trivial amounts of ram
with arbitrary peripherals doing
open-ended computation so this is like
basically high-end phones competing with
Android then yes but Google is known in
the past also to create multiple
products for a specific market so it's
not necessarily the first time they've
done this so you don't think that
they're trying to phase out Android no
no they're creating this as an
alternative to Android hecka um
interesting I mean who knows long term
this may be the next layer chrome pixel
or the Google pixel will be featuring
this there may be a special version of
the pixel with this special operating
system or something like that but um the
UI that's been shown so far you know
it's very much compromised by blocks you
know you're not necessarily gonna see
what's in them but you know this is
email reminder comprise comprise did I
say compromised anything didn't didn't
mean to say that but as you scroll
through this you can see different
things like you might have cards that
are available like it and Android right
now you can tap on them to bring the app
fullscreen basic UI functionality type
stuff you can long press on an app and
create sort of a windowed mode and you
can drag them around on top of each
other to move them around which is
something that you don't necessarily see
on Android a different way of moving
things around there's a tablet mode so
they're definitely designing it to work
with multiple devices not just
smartphones you can also quickly do like
split screen interface so you can pop
apps between that so for multi tasking
this is a three app split screen mode
that they have as well and then also
different ways of configuring apps to be
shown side by side
so you can actually use stuff at the
same time probably again more useful for
something like a tablet but here you can
see like email and various other screens
that they have lined up tabbed modes
tab interface with a phone screen
there's also suggestion panels and a
keyboard interface and all that good
stuff so um yeah kind of interesting
not sure how how long it's going to be
until there's something based or that
actually uses this operating system but
interesting that Google is developing it
the graphics renderer is actually Vulcan
based which is is also kind of cool and
again given that it's open source and
they're using lots of open source
license development kits you know there
seems to be lots of potential
flexibility and implementations of it so
interesting I again like you said it's
like weird it's too sick well Google has
Android Android doesn't have a whole lot
of competition outside of Apple so why
would they develop something else
something new but obviously they have
their reasons and the UI that we were
just walking you through there by the
way is the fuchsia assist the current
fuchsia system UI and it's called
armadillo it does look very modern yeah
I'll say it looks looks very
contemporary which you which you would
expect coming from Google so there you
go all right
here's a bit of hardware news
Coolermaster is launching a new product
also if anyone from guru 3d is watching
you have a typo in your headline lunch
shiz typo in your headline that is lunch
this that is journalism mr. jazz is
big-time journalism man I never have any
and accuracies er Arizona hey I'm not
saying I've had never had a typo before
by the typo in the headline is bet okay
sorry guru D but thank you for this
article as well as the wonderful
pictures look a new case from
Coolermaster this is the master box
light five there it is so very similar
it's part of the master case line so I
would imagine it's going to be intercom
pata bethalto case series accessories
and that kind of thing it's available in
three different colors though this is
the red
version that's shown here there's also a
version with sort of a silver trim as
well as black trim it's got four hundred
and twenty millimeter fans built into it
which that's pretty nice I'm guessing
there's maybe one at the back and one at
the top and two at the front it sounds
reasonable but I like that for 120
millimeter coolermaster fans
coolermaster usually does pretty pretty
good fans even they're kind of
bare-bones ones that they ship with
chassis zzz's mm-hmm
here's a look at it with the actual
parts installed it has an edge to edge
transparent acrylic side panel which you
know that could be fun I don't know how
I feel about the rear cable routing
cutouts there's no there's no real
grommets it's not so this is a budget
this is a budget case okay bear that in
mind so it does have a dark mirror front
panel as you can see right here so the
red version here I'm not sure if the red
version shifts with red LED fans or if
this is just something that they're
doing for the marketing materials but
you would potentially be able to see red
LED fans through there so there's that
and it's only $49.99 euros which the
reason I knew how many euros $49.99
euros was when you were talking about
that price enhancer show it's cuz I
looked it up for this article which is
about fifty five dollars to us so this
competes directly with the something
like the Corsair speck zero for it would
you just talked about on my half but I
don't hate the front of this one I'm
gonna be honest this looks a lot nicer
this looks cleaner
it looks more expensive - I like the
front of this I'm not necessarily a huge
fan of the clear look here I'd have to
see it in person to see how clean it
actually looks I wouldn't want it to
look tacky but it already looks way
better than the corset but it does seem
to already look much better on the front
here's here's a look at the side with
the completely clear side panel acrylic
which I'm on the fence about - this is
probably a cheaper way of producing a
side panel I have to imagine yeah that
would be less expensive than metal but
it does give a complete look at the side
and with the cover over the power supply
the internals look nice so it's nice you
get a basement yeah for that price point
they got the base rate so-so 55 bucks us
I think
I think Corsair has a pretty nice
potential case here like Kyle said it's
missing a few of the nicer things that
you get with the cases it cost more like
eighty or a hundred bucks I take it back
though if it's fifty five bucks right
here
it's five so it's still pretty damn good
there you go a little SSD tray right
there on the front - yes so again this
is a guru 3d article and it's talking
about the launch in Europe and it should
be available at local resellers in
Europe by the end of May 2017 I don't
know if that applies to the US as well
but hopefully this would also be
available in the US yeah okay moving on
YouTube has a dark bone now have you
seen this you familial test I heard
about it I haven't seen it though try it
afresh look for YouTube yes your desktop
design highlights your favorite videos
and creators while making YouTube easier
and more fun to use we're still working
on it but we can't wait for you to try
it out and let us know what you think
right now try it out click the try Now
button yep hold on if you go to
youtube.com slash new you can access
this page which has a quick look at the
clean design for their new UI which does
look very clean it looks like they're
pretty wider with fewer lines separating
things yeah that's ok though dark theme
though I really like this option do it
dark mode is cool do it
they also reference a totally new site
design that's built on a new faster
framework that means we can build new
faster new features faster such as dark
theme and more to come and you can try
it now now I'm just to be on the safe
side I'm going to try it now but not
show people ok you can show this right
yeah sure all right so I hit try it now
so this is the recommended feed and the
show more and again that's it feels like
cleaner looks like stuff spaced out just
slightly more yeah
yeah that's like it'd be it would read
better on mobile for sure come he got
fired let's not talk about that uh
COBE about this FBI oh no we're not
gonna get into that so yeah that's
that's not bad um hold on let me see if
I can pull up dark mode dark mood do the
dirt
stop it I think Dirk mode is up here Oh
dark theme I'm just making sure that I
can show this also we're watching we're
for streaming an ad that's playing on
the video that we're streaming oh no
never mind this is an ad that's playing
on my video never mind never mind
so if you go up here you can choose a
dark theme activate activate dark theme
oh it basically just turns it into
YouTube gaming that's exactly what it
does is this a non skippable ad I
shouldn't have non skippable ads playing
it can I skip it well you do know that
you're skint it to a - ticket to last
elegant look at that look how dark it is
sorry there's somebody just like my god
it's cuz this is like oh that's utter oh
yes I really this is it really segwaying
people - that from my thousand-dollar
bill that's pretty much genius I was not
intending that it's not up to you it's
like it's just Google okay being on
point that's just what happened it's
very funny hey that looks pretty cool I
like it yeah I like it
that looks clean why not sure everyone
go for the dark theme and again you can
access that by going to youtube.com
slash new but you do have to opt in for
right now because I think it's kind of
like a beta beta thing or something like
that what's going people happy here
politeness
lettuce is $1,000 build is be quiets
fault it is be quiet no that's not true
since I got sponsored with the same
parts the same parts not not more than a
month ago
Oh or he output his okay and I almost
did a similar build and I was like I
thought exactly what everyone in the
comment section of his video was
thinking this is horrible price
performance so instead I matched up the
rest of the parts to sort of you know to
sort make sense really for it to make
sense um okay
it was gonna be a budget build it was
like no not with that cooler not with
that case and idiot I put in 1800 X in
it and it was it was a high end rising
build which then all this
sudden makes perfect scent is subtly
fine it's a great system because then
extra money spent on a hundred and fifty
dollar power supply versus a hundred
dollar power supply it gets folded into
it a lot more easily right but like
honestly the like I thought about this a
lot because you know I went and
commented on that video and actually I
had the top comments on that video for I
don't know if it's still that way noises
- this video and I felt completely
justified by it because it was
completely organic
like I saw his video thousand dollar
build guide I was like oh - did a new
build guide I haven't seen one of those
in a while let's check it out they
usually do a pretty good job yeah
thousand bucks hey I just did a thousand
dollar build I bet he's doing horizon
build let's see what he used yeah
looked at it I was like oh wow it's a I
five seventy four hundred seventy four
seventy five hundred and seventy five
hundred seventy five hundred and like it
rx what uh it was a GPU it was not a ten
seventy it was a step down from attempt
already orifice 480 or five eighty or
something like that I just looked at I
was like man this just seems
disappointing so I mean I made the
comment very much how I thought like at
the time I was like wow this just seems
like a letdown compared to like the rise
and stuff that's available right now and
yeah you know I tried not to make it too
much like hey go look at my channel like
I said yeah I'd be that guy but Emory
but yeah a lot of people a lot of people
apparently thought the same thing so so
there you go um but yeah where where was
I go with that no I totally agree I felt
like Linus should have known to like not
green like that oh I know what I was
gonna say is what I was thinking about
is is how much is it is about phrasing
and how you phrase a video yeah and how
you present it to people cuz I was
thinking like you know what if you left
a thousand bucks out of that he left
budget out of that and he said here's a
build guide yeah here's how to build a
system yeah and maybe said here's the
build we used and here's two or three
other parts lists that you could build
using these same techniques and blah
blah like I think he would have gotten
zero blow but blow back on that so I
think that was just a phrasing one word
one word in your title or description
your thumbnail can change everything
yeah it can really can how how people
breathe how people are viewing it from
the get-go and that kind of thing so you
always have to find like a strike cabal
and we're not trying to roast Linus I
think Linus would agree with us on this
yeah we're not roasting very very honest
they're providing great just genuine
feedback okay all right we have one last
news story to get through really quickly
this is from hot hardware apparently
there's another incoming rise in
microcut microcode update which will
potentially expand ddr4 memory support
which is very slow speeds hopefully
potentially faster speeds potentially
just more memory validated compatibility
excuse me um so yeah what AMD calls
their micro code updates is AG akiza
I've heard venice'
I've heard them pronounce it once or
twice before a GES a which is AMD I
don't know what the rest of it stands
for I knew what it stood for a minute
ago hold on let's see if I can find it
it stands for something gisa
something important it's AMD Amanda rose
collection sterling silver diamond
necklace AMD generic encapsulated
software architecture does what a geesa
stands for anyway though um about a
month ago they rolled out one point zero
zero four you're one point zero point
zero point four and what has now been
discussed by gigabyte in some forums and
on overclockers UK where they've been
talking about an upcoming gigabyte bios
update for some of those easy I'm sorry
ex 370 boards and gigabyte was talking
about various things like it's going to
help out with I am iommu fixes and some
other options like disabling the land
and ROM image update and cold boot
options and all that kind of stuff but
at the end of it they mentioned also a
GC 1 0-0 6 which is going to improve
memory support yay
he said got high hopes for this one get
it enable 20 plus memory registers so um
that's pretty cool memory support has
been sort of flaky with AMD depending on
what memory modules who use this is a
big part of the reason why just g.skill
launched their flair x-series very
specifically Samsung be die single
ranked ddr4 configurations which is
going to give you much much better
potential for having compatibility out
of the box with AMD rise in platforms
and having faster memory on resin is a
very very fat very very good way to get
better performance in particular a much
a very good way to get better gaming
performances that's what you're aiming
for the article points out some of the
things that were updated with the one
0:04 update from last month they reduced
drm latency by 6 nanoseconds they
resolved the FMA 3 code sequence bug
that was causing system Ang's they
resolved an overclocked sleep bug and a
couple other things but basically it's
coming soon since gigabyte obviously has
it or has some version of its that
they're rolling rolling into a UEFI
update so if you have a Rison system you
should definitely get it as soon as it's
available and would be available via a
bios or UEFI update download from your
motherboard manufacturer so whether if
you have asrock gigabyte msi or asus
motherboard they should have that on
their support page as soon as that rolls
out hello everyone get that sounds good
alright um wow we've actually used that
most of the time but we are going to
answer some questions here towards the
end of the show and we are also going to
do some johnson chef shoutouts very
shortly as well so thanks to all you
guys who have donated during the show
your lovely people and I guess maybe
let's should we just get right into that
yeah sure ok Oh C vs a-holes hat all
right so we got flippin Fred I believe
is this is this I don't see what the
does it does it separate
is Kyle's half Gerald I hear ya oh did
you put yours no Kyle the quote was from
the big from the Big Lebowski ah okay
wait what Oh Gerald
let's did you find out where the
beginning is why does it say Kyle's half
down there dude tomorrow's already the
tenth cuz we read these ones right right
right now this it's false half cells
just drunk this is you're right correct
cells drunk gets pulled out okay it's
fine it's fine
lay off lay off the booze so it's fine
all right on to my half first often $5
from automatic Matt thank you Matt thank
you for welcoming Bianca but Kyle scared
her off a bit now you got a winner over
PS thanks guys what I don't know why I'm
surprised hey I you know she's probably
better off you know my room I did her a
favor by scaring the living daylights
out of her you know she's in a better
place now I've always been one to say
you know what you just got to be
yourself from the get-go how do people
know what they're in for
because if you try to if you try to you
know cover it ain't just lovely picture
of yourself or whatever eventually
that's gonna fall apart
yep and so you know you just give back
look Here I am
whip it out and maybe maybe I'm
offensive to the you know female people
small end region each tribe you know
what what why I don't know just where
I'm not sure where I was like a left
turn in there yeah I did not follow
along Matt thank you for your donation
yeah thanks man that's what we're trying
to get at crimson beneth help don't know
what to choose for dedicated 3d modeling
animation gaming rig components is it
better by Zen 1,800 x in a vega RX for
580 or go intel right now by and large
it seems like if you want the most bang
for your buck go for an 8 core AMD
rising processor which you can get for
as little as 320 330 bucks for a 1,700
especially if you're willing to
overclock it a little bit that is where
you will get the most performance for
your money and that seems to apply very
broadly to most CPU intensive tasks
there's a of course a bit more of a
question that comes into it and a bit
more options and potential Intel
competition when it comes to
specifically gaming but if you're
talking about through your modeling
animation well you also said gaming but
3d modeling and animation I'd say go for
that rise in CPU right now and then as
far as your GPU just just check what
software you're using to see if it uses
CUDA if it uses OpenCL and plan
accordingly if it's if it's cuda heavy
if they work very closely with Nvidia I
would say maybe go with it and video GPU
if it's OpenCL go for Andy but thank you
Crimson beneth Bayless Jared beigel
Jared Gerald Baker that Jimmy burger for
the $10 Gerald Baker thank you again for
the 10 buck I'll the quote was from Big
Lebowski
thank you for refreshing my memory Paul
I'm drinking green flash GFB none of
your wonderful pub last lovely in true
what Ron Swanson fashion here is $10 do
with it how you see fit
Michele thank you sir love round cheers
to you he's the best leaver mature um
Odin hey and runs our hands are $5
there's your lost revenue thank you all
I didn't think you can play that ukulele
by the way Kyle said my name right lol
Odin Oda hunt now I forgot how I said it
oh honey oh damn Oda hang o tehani
I hope it's in tune oda hein overhang
sing us a song all don't know if it's in
tune
also i have not practiced all right you
you play the song and then I'll read the
donation comments in singsong you know
to your to your music school lullaby
that's how we're going to do all the
comments donation questions from now the
melody Jeb Bush no $15 donation please
cheer me on while I work on the thesis I
have to defend on Friday also here's
some of the money I just won back from a
scammer because I have a Dworkin oh
thanks jack mustard we don't intend
Devi's the RGB PC has 7 terabytes more
of storage now mix again hole fingered
accomplish a /n TGS that's that's
mustard for that is the if if I'm
reading this correctly there's the
winner of the RGB PC oh yeah and
apparently he has Adam Freeman terabytes
of storage that's frickin excellent Wow
does everyone win an immature link to
which maybe I can pull up yes oh I
totally do that
ok all right hold on let's see if we're
gonna do that I'm curious okay Cal Cal
maybe you can you can keep moving on
yeah okay uh mystics tube for the $10 in
Canadian I would love to see a video
with a GPU cooled by a hyper Evo 212 for
science also happy to see you spread the
word about net neutrality yes that'd be
an interesting video hyper 212 cooling a
GPU I'm stealing that one that would be
interesting totally stealing that one I
don't know it's gotta be possible Robert
Davis for the five bucks I am water
cooling my computer what company should
I use and which should I avoid also
softer heart tubing I haven't
bending ever soft tubing if you really
want just like the easiest route yeah
hard to me if you want to look maybe a
little bit nicer but obviously spend a
lot more time and an effort trying to
perfect it there is a learning curve to
it it can be stressful companies that
I've used for water cooling mainly
comprised of ek water blocks that's
really like I don't say bits powers
aren't very good for fittings primo
chill I think also has a wide selection
they've been adding more stuff recently
and everything fantex has been expanding
their line and then doing some GPU
blocks and that kind of thing recently
as well
alpha cool has some pretty good
radiators and things like that I check
out alpha cool um yeah all those go
watch all of Jays videos you'll know
more about water cooling soon enough
mate penny $5 Powell you finish your
beer for five bucks first time viewer
and love your channel
he loves yeah I can probably do that and
it's he's a first-time viewer okay so
the only way that we're gonna get repeat
customers here call it is just pound
your second there you go
you've already pounded a whole beer
earlier today so what's another today
Brian Webb two bucks can i buy some of
your used components
um if I you sell them nicer yeah yeah
I'm not gonna just sell them just for
any old person but I put them up for
some but eventually maybe I'll sell them
and I'll send out some message or
whatever to go do this no I miss
the first half of the show here Paul
take my money Kyle I'll make sure you
get my money's right next week Kota we
know you're good for it I will come next
week to collect from y'all ass coach you
best believe son I will collect Daniel
Drew's and a bag a buck knife Daniel
yeah it's really ninety hey buck 90
solid Christian $10 burger in there last
man show Linus mentioned the video had
been in the pipeline for a while and
they goofed on the name PS hi from OC
hey oh yeah hello from Orange County and
yes that happens sometimes especially
like Linus he's got a huge team he
probably plans videos out like months in
advance
I mean maybe at least weeks at least
weeks so maybe he started planning that
rig before Rison it's possible who knows
but any rate um thank you very much for
the donation thanks Christian Derek
param2
thanks Derek yeah juvenile 1 2 2 8 15
bucks
crap $50 yeah beautiful now he did
anything dealers what do you do he
donated $50 to you on your half of the
show you keep that you have to give him
a flip you have to give him a flip and
flip bra I can't I just playing what
play more and play more ukulele I can do
more you could give me give me a good
give me a good me good course I can only
keep 2 chords as I complete do that
chord progression Paul some a little
some little jazzy some Lulla upbeat
right wait go automatic mad fun the
others thanks guys oh it's just kidding
count kidding a bad one watch the
earlier part of the show to find out
fragment $5 this is a please stop lol my
ears hurt sure they do Fred yeah PC four
one nine tech tips $20 all the way from
Melbourne Australia
oh it's 20 Australian dollars what's
that I don't know great all right guys
awesome content as always hopefully you
can buy some PC parts for relatively
cheap oh who are we kidding you live in
 Australia yeah
red red once again for $20 what do you
think of dxracer chairs don't you have a
DX no trace nope that's not its verdict
here we don't know we only got two
vertical got maximum acquittal no
everything yeah yeah yeah I'll do it for
gun sebastian me Casilla 20 ALS mini-itx
micro-atx kini build with aim I don't
know jiggly's well everybody all right
is that a blender no we have a few more
here if you are Mini ITX my crazy ex you
know do whatever your heart desires
depends on what kind of function you
want the board to have a bit more
expandability options micro ITX more
brand I like that I heard my three
checks
Thank You Geum did you have a little bit
more expandability yeah your memory GPU
you got another PCIe laying there
my group Mini ITX it can just really
need the smallest possible Rick be our
battles $2 are we still doing this sir
well then are we still are you I'm just
gonna I'm going to talk next couple ones
here yeah you can just will do the speak
disease where you type music yep be our
battles $2.00 what's the best upgrade
for the price from my 970 I'd say a gtx
1070 perhaps significant increase in
performance there and it's not going to
set you back too much you know good 300
to 350 bucks you're the cheaper models I
think that's a good place to start
hold a sword for the five bucks so bold
sorry
bold ass or very blue sir very bold of
you to donate without
any sort of comment no no here it is
I've had my 3770k and gtx 1070 with 16
gigs of ram set up for a few years now
thinking i've gone for rising with the
gtx 1070 now we're just talk about that
what do you know or should I wait for
things like Vega to release Vega is
around the corner
I'd say with your current set-up you're
probably doing pretty well you don't
need to upgrade immediately you probably
hold out a little bit until Vega drops
you can see for yourself with the sort
of price and performance is compared to
something like a gtx 970 and decide from
there obviously we don't have the inside
scoop even if we did we couldn't tell
you about Vega performance so just hold
out for it when launches are right
around the corner it's worth your
patience is generally reward Russell for
cell $25 hey guys from a bartender and a
brew pub here's a tip also expect a care
package soon oh why thank you very much
Russell from a brew pub I am excited
yeah no doubts me very subtly checking
my particular peel boxes frequently Kodu
fellas what is the album coming out guys
never any better recording equipment
yeah we do first things first we gotta
get signed label is it's very involved
process crimson be Hillier one gbb no
comment why thank you very much pre the
tip and finally mystics Toob Toob
canadian happy to hear you may look at
the Evo 212 GPU idea yeah it was a great
idea we will definitely check it out
people do a clever on it or something
like that we both heard it yeah yeah but
um that's gonna conclude it for the
donations guys thank you so much for for
donating all that you have on both half
the shows we really do appreciate it
it does help and glorious Johnson shout
outs bow where we close things out as we
do really quickly we'll go over these
because we were slightly over time now
yeah thank you very very much Ian for
picking up table Johnson Johnson serving
the glasses is such consistent double
jump
it's cooler serious and in the pub last
double glass option there hey Kyle D
this is my my brother-in-law

to come yes my brother-in-law
his name is also Kyle he picked up a
stay positive shirt dude you could have
just asked for one I would just send me
one it's like seriously we're related
now money that's just a perk you get you
just smell like hey castle
on this shirt else give to you but thank
you very much sir I do pay hey bro I
have I have either Nicolas or I get get
to hella I'll get to Nilla double
Johnson we're possibly Nicolas oh yes
say Johnson to both you from the suta
Valley thank you so much you can come
screw men's black shirts sorry the dogs
are freaking out right now anyway
thank you for being a BIOS lesser shirt
and a CPU cool shirt sir or mana hey Doc
I can't yell at the Mandy Ewing from
handy evolution shirt and a CPU cooler
shirt thank you very much sir Thanks
Andy Andy Johnson and I have two more
Concetta or Nick a CPU cooler shirt
magenta or Nick Thank You Concetta Thank
You Concetta hopefully I'm pronouncing
your name right and that's all I got
okay from I got two more uh John from
Chesterfield Virginia thank you so much
John got the thumbscrew decal and an
English pub glass and finally a Johnson
going out to Jeff from Wisconsin thank
you so much Jeff got thumbscrew men's
navy blue t-shirt thank you so much Jeff
for your support I really hope you enjoy
that shirt they're nice and soft yeah
okay that ends awesome hardware episode
105 we're pretty much done for today
thank you guys so much for watching
it's been fun we are going to as we
traditionally do send anyone who's
watching live over to do a bit of a
switch raid twitch.tv slash psycho stick
yes it was suggested by our other
beautiful moderators spider-man
thank you very much spider we're gonna
go ahead and host automatically you can
head over there your self dial in the
the URL if you'd like psycho stick just
like it sounds
psycho cystic no other way to say the
same way to spell it so everyone go over
there tell them we sent you thank you so
much for watching watching awesome
hardware as always and I will get well
both be back later this week
with tons of glorious videos and new
content it's going to be awesome
including the surprise build that we
built for self oh yeah we've got we
built sell a surprise build if we did it
was awesome and we'll have that video
for you guys later he cried he cried he
was a yeah flowing this remote town of
yours yep
he was poured his heart and soul was
touching yeah a touching moment you got
to see it got to see it to believe it
