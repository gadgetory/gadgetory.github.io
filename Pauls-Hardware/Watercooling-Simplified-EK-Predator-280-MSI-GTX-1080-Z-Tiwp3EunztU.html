Hardware I like to try to spend equal
time between water-cooled systems and
non water-cooled systems because I know
water cooling is fun and entertaining
but it's not something that everyone is
into why don't you find yourself in this
situation you have built yourself or are
in the process of building yourself a
very nice high-end air-cooled system may
be featuring the highest end graphics
card least on the consumer level
currently available like a GTX 1080 got
it all set up in like a awesome build
like this one back here behind me and
then you realize you know what
I want more I want to try out water
cooling but maybe you're a little bit
too afraid to connect all the fittings
and do leak testing I want to maybe
overclock a little bit more or maybe you
just want to silence your system and get
a little bit cooler
well ek may have devised a solution for
you by combining their predator series
of all-in-one liquid coolers now
available in 280 millimeter size by the
way with a prefilled GPU block with
quick disconnects that means you can
take the quick disconnects and loop the
GPU into your CPU loop and get yourself
a GPU and CPU cooling solution without
having to like fill any reservoirs or
leak tests or you know do the fittings
or any of that kind of stuff maybe that
takes some of the fun out of it for some
of you guys but for others it makes it a
lot less worrisome and it also gives you
the ability to say get an all-in-one CPU
cooler right now and then maybe expand
it to a GPU and CPU loop in the future
but I have done today is set up an air
cooled system which again is right there
behind me I'm going to be testing that
at stock and also run some over clocks
with the air-cooled setup and that's
featuring the GT X 1080 gaming Z here
from MSI as well as a 59 30 K and then
we'll pop in the ek predator solution
and see what kind of difference it makes
here are the specs for the system I've
set up I was originally going to use a
fan Tex m2 pro case but did not have
enough vertical space on the radiator
mount at the top so I went with the
corsair 760 t instead which has plenty
of room up there power supplies the EVGA
g2 750 watt 240 gig HyperX savage SSD
and msi x99s kale rip does 516 gig
memory kit at
66 and intel core i7 59 30 k-6 core cpu
and for the air-cooled setup at least a
tenner max ETS t4 TB CPU cooler and then
of course the graphics card the MSI GTX
1080 gaming Z GPU and if you're
confusing this with the gaming X it is a
little bit different it has a fully
custom PCB and they've also added added
an integrated led logo on the back of
the card itself on the back plate which
is a pretty cool place level logo
actually looks pretty nice let's take a
look at our first set of test results
first though since for some reason it
decided to be 104 degrees here in
Diamond Bar even though it's September
geez alright so first off I wanted to
point out that I have removed the top
cover for this system so it does have
exhaust on the top even though we're
going with the air-cooled setup right
now so what I've been doing is running a
Unigine valley on loop as well as the
i-264 system stability test I'm sorry
that I'm recording the screen right now
let's take a look at the results so air
cooled this system has actually been
doing really well hasn't had to spin up
the fans too much or anything like that
GPU is actually peaking up to about
2,000 50 megahertz out of the box that
is up from it's out of the box boost
clock of 1911 I have been running the
Ida for system stability test just with
the CPU stress going on it's for almost
20 minutes now actually over 20 minutes
now as well as of course the engine
valley benchmark so that's doing the GPU
whereas the system stability test is
doing the CPU so if both of those going
on there should be a pretty good amount
of heat building up in the system CPU
however has only gotten up to about 58
degrees max on the core actually I'm
sorry 59 degrees max as I'm checking
right now which is very not bad in the
least then as far as the GPUs
temperatures it actually got up to about
70 degrees Celsius at one point but
after the fans ramped up it ended up
averaging around 60 degrees Celsius so
very nice as for the CPU it's running at
3.6 gigahertz on all six course that's
again just the stock frequency out of
the box for a 59 30 K and 50 degrees
Celsius again was that maximum core temp
so temperatures are definitely not that
bad let's check out sound though this is
kind of anecdotal but I do have my
shotgun mic set
up and here's a listen
next up we have overclock results so
basically I've dialed in a four point
four gigahertz overclock on the CPU
pretty standard straight up OC in that
regard it is at one point two volts one
point two two volts to be more specific
and running a four point four gigahertz
on all six CPU cores giving me CPU
temperatures at around 81 degrees C
maximum although they did level around
out around in the mid 70s which is a
little bit better that is a pretty big
jump though that again went from 58
degrees C with not overclocked up to 81
C so that might be an area where we can
see some benefit from going with a
liquid cooler as far as a GPU I did
first establish a faster fan curve
that's usually what I do in overclock so
fan curve in this instance is running at
75 to 80 percent versus the stock where
it was running at about 50 percents
that's giving us GPU temperatures are
actually a little bit cooler than before
65 degrees C peak temperature so
definitely some help from that the extra
bit of fan rotational speed that we have
in there and I'll give you a noise test
here in just a moment here's overclock
settings plus 25 on the available extra
core voltage 107 percent on the power
limits CPU GPU core clock is it plus 80
points and the memory clocks it plus 350
now what that overclocked has given us
is basically an operating speed of about
21 mm 114 which is actually pretty damn
nice especially for these GTX 1080s is
actually probably the fastest stable dt
x 1080 that I have run and the stock
that's been given to me so good job msi
with this gaming z graphics card here's
a quick sound test once again though
again everything is under load
everything is overclocked
so here everything is still staying
fairly quiet however we can definitely
tell with the additional rotational
speed of the fans they are creating a
bit more noise you know it also is
making a decent amount of noises here Oh
snoring down there take don't make fun
of me snoring
looks like my warranty is voided all
right so everything is installed
there's definitely extra tubing which I
had to sort of route back down under
here and around here and I actually put
a velcro piece in there just to sort of
hold stuff back in a way for when I put
the side panel on but other than that I
have parted on everything works and
there are no leaks and I have noticed
however there is now a significant
amount of GPU sag like like check that
out clearly things are not level so I
actually have an idea this is something
that I've thought of a while back and
I've never actually tried but here goes
I've tied the bit of fishing line to the
top of the case and right down here
somewhere
and there it is the most ghetto GPU sag
mod ever you don't even notice it do you
okay look not even like completely level
mostly level it looks looks pretty level
as long as you don't like pay attention
to the fishing line
alright I've now been running the stress
test CPU stress test for actually over
20 minutes now and I kicked in the GPU
test just recently as well have it say
everything seems to be pretty stable and
even though I have overclocked the GPU
just a little bit more added another 10
points to it so I'm at plus 90 on the
GPU clock offset plus 350 on the memory
and then I also have manually forced the
CPU fan header since I have that's what
I have the ek predator connected to to
65% speed because what I found was
especially when I was doing just GPU
tests if it's only connected to the CPU
header that these beads wouldn't improve
so I've actually set up speed fan to do
that what that has ended up giving me is
GPU frequencies upwards of 2120 165 was
a peak that we hit although 21:52 seems
a little bit more standard that is
averaging out around 20 140 21:39 56 C
was the peak temp on the GPU itself
which is significantly less than the
peak temperature when it was air-cooled
average temps only about 51 degrees
Celsius which really isn't that much
cooler again than with the air cooler on
there however again we are running at a
higher frequency so that is nice as well
but of course hopefully also we have
less noise being generated with this as
well CPU temps maxed at 76 degrees
Celsius on the package which is a little
on the warm side but averages were more
around the 60 to 70 C range and again
that is still with 4.4 gigahertz
overclock and that is good 10 to 15
degrees less than what we had with air
cooler at least if you're looking at
average temperatures this system was
already pretty quiet when I had an air
cooled can you guys tell difference now
of course now there are also fans up on
top
those are ek Vardar fans
and now with the side panel open just to
get the interior noise
that's fairly quiet all right guys let's
wrap things up here the ek predator XL c
280 has done a great job for me as far
as getting things a little bit cooler
maybe a little bit quieter in the system
and also give me the opportunity to
actually install what is effectively a
full custom loop without having to
handle some of the perhaps more
difficult aspects of actually installing
a full custom loop also it's expandable
which I really like so on the plus side
for this product we have that it is
definitely cheaper than investing in a
full custom loop uses all standardized
ek high-quality parts with G 1/4
fittings and of course it has great
performance at least from what I've seen
today
now you could of course service this
loop if you wanted to and in fact I even
had to my initial installation of the
GPU block wasn't quite as secure as it
could be and I had to actually remove
that reinstall it if I had done a full
custom loop removing the GPU and then
tightening down the radiator the block
on it or anything like that would be
challenging whereas I was able to just
undo the qdcs
pull it out tighten some stuff down pop
it right back in I also want to point
out it stays nice and quiet thanks to a
quiet pump and play ek Vardar 140
millimeter fans now on the cons side
there's definitely a few things to point
out one is that if you're comparing this
to a full custom loop yeah it's
inexpensive but you're still going to be
spending three to four hundred dollars
on the predator as well as the GPU block
add-on with the full everything set up
the way you saw me do it today going all
air cooling is definitely going to be a
cheaper solution but that kind of goes
without saying when it comes to most
water cooling solutions I also want to
point out you need a pretty decent size
case for this setup again I had to swap
to this case due to the 68 millimeter
thickness for that radiator and pump
combo up on top just in order to be able
to fit it all so once I got all this
tubing in here there is a pretty decent
amount of tubing there so having the
extra space to be able to kind of tuck
that back away get it out of sights or
at least not have it just looking like a
jumble of cables in there it's
definitely nice to be able to do beyond
that you might notice that I have a
pretty decent amount of GPU sag that is
due to the additional weight of the
block the weight of the tubing here and
the fact that some of the rigidity of
the board with some of the
stuff that MSI put on there to keep it
rigid this is gone now I'd remove it to
put the Block on so if that's something
that irritates you and this may be
unique to just my situation you might
consider a support for it or something
like that and lastly if you're doing
this specifically to get the benefits of
a custom loop without having to go
through all the installation procedures
of a custom loop you do still have to do
some of the more technical type stuff
such as removing the GPU cooler adding
thermal paste and thermal pads and
everything and getting that out put that
back together which is not a huge deal
but something that some folks might be a
little bit more cautious about
approaching themselves and I should also
mention based on actual results you saw
the actual performance gains you might
get by going from really high-end air
cooling to high-end water cooling might
be pretty incremental as you saw I was
only able to get maybe 25 mega Hertz
more out of this GPU with it being
stable granted there's other benefits
besides just the performance but if
you're doing this connecting to get a
huge leap it might be minimal some
closing notes to add would be this is a
280 millimeter radiator radiator at the
top handling both the CPU and GPU which
are both pretty high-end and that's a
pretty decent amount of heat I was kind
of expecting maybe a little bit lower
temperatures here but I was kind of
comparing it to other water cooling
steps that have at least two radiators
so whereas 280 millimeter seems to be
pretty adequate for this I would be a
little bit more hesitant if you're going
with the 240 millimeter EK predator for
example you might seriously consider
adding another radiator to that because
that will keep the overall temperatures
and your loop down and probably get you
a better cooling performance especially
if you're comparing it to the air
cooling also you should seriously
consider which fan header you plug this
into when I was initially running some
tests and I was doing a GPU load with no
CPU load since the CPU temperatures
weren't increasing it wasn't increasing
the speed of the pump and the fans at
the top of the system which meant that
my GPU was getting much hotter than I'd
like it to be that's why I ended up
using speed fan to manually control the
speeds of that unit up on top and then
of course there was my backplate
solution I decided to reuse the msi
backplate from the gaming z because it's
nice and has the light-up LED logo that
ended up working for me but your mileage
may vary depending on what GPU you
actually have and what back plates on
there of course EK makes back plates for
these as well that you can buy
separately but a
and added expense and that's all for
this video guys if you enjoyed it hit
the thumbs up button and let me know
down in the comment section you can
comment on things and argue about
whether or not you think this is a good
solution for people to use on their
computers and of course in the
description there are links to these
products where they are available for
sale as well as my store where you can
purchase trips like this one and mugs
and PEG glasses to help support my cause
thank you very much for watching as
