welcome to my monthly builds video for
February 20 19 month at the beginning of
the month I'd do a couple parts lists
for you guys at home who might be
building your own computer especially if
you're doing it for the first time
choosing the parts to put in the PC is
usually the first thing you need to
figure out if you're looking for a video
where I actually put a PC together check
out my builds playlist I will link that
in the video's description and of course
every month I ask you guys for your
feedback on what builds I shouldn't put
together for the next month so last
month I asked you when you want to see
in February the winner was $1,500 all I
was asking for was price points last
month close runner-up was a $400 price
point don't worry I've actually got
three builds for you guys today at three
different price points and I think
you'll be happy with them but also don't
forget to vote for next month's builds
straw polls link in the description and
I tried to give you guys some more
abstract or potentially different types
of build options there like an audio or
a video PC or other options check it out
before I dive into the parts list though
and an unprecedented act of foresight I
actually have already assembled actually
all the systems that I'm gonna be
talking about today and I'm putting
together a new updated how to build a PC
guide for 2019 where I assemble the
systems including an intro video where I
talk about the theory of what parts are
what and what they do
hopefully just to give you guys more
confidence as you're choosing your own
parts to build your own PC that said
though let's dive into today's builds I
have three of them starting with a less
than 500 dollar gaming PC for starters
coming in at about 480 dollars right now
we have an upgrade to that PC which is
going to come in at about 900 dollars
upgrading to a discrete graphics card
actually about 882 as of today's pricing
and then of course the $1500 build as
requested with an Intel processor this
is gonna be a really high-end system
coming in actually just a little over
$1500 but I'll explain how I came to
those decisions when I get to that build
so here's the sub 500 dollar gaming PC
and this one is featuring the Rison 320
200 G which is an APU which means it's
got a quad core 4 core 4 thread
processor as well as integrated Vega
graphics so that means you can get away
without having your graphics card this
is perfectly fine for gaming at 1080p of
course you're gonna get a nice benefit
by upgrading the processor and the
graphics card in the future which you
can do but before we get into that let's
talk about the rest of the parts for the
motherboard I'm still recommending this
MSI Arsenal gaming B 450 tomahawk which
comes in it usually about 105 205
Dean dollars it is an am for socket
motherboard it has 4 memory slots and it
actually has pretty decent power
delivery so you can start out with a
low-end entry-level CPU like the sub
$100 2200 G and then you can potentially
upgrade to something else in the future
and the motherboard will still be able
to handle it there aren't a lot of fancy
bells and whistles on this board but it
does have video outs at the back so it
will work with an APU memory prices
thankfully have come way down when
you're talking about horizon system you
want to make sure you have compatible
memory and also faster memory 3000 or
3200 speed is what I usually go for this
is a 16 gig kit 2 by 8 gigs in it you
can get it for about 115 dollars that's
a solid option and their jaws 5 you know
it's all black no fancy RGB or anything
but it's gonna match with most builds
for storage right now for just about
anyone you should spend about 50 bucks
on a 2.5 inch SSD and you can get quite
a few at that range you can spend a few
dollars more on one that maybe is a
little bit faster this team l5 light is
definitely pretty entry-level there's
nothing to fake crazy or fancy about it
it does have a black housing so you can
remove the sticker if you wanted to
actually put it on display but chances
are you're gonna tuck it away back in
the case somewhere and then it will just
function as an SSD 50 bucks 500 gig SSD
that's what most people should be going
for for any build right now but the case
I actually have my editor Joe go to
micro Center and pick out the cases so I
wouldn't be tainted by my prior
knowledge of cases I told him to get
about a sixty to eighty dollar case for
this entry-level build he chose the
master box light 5 RGB because that's
what they had at micro Center
it's about $70 you can actually get it
without the RGB for about 5 bucks less
than this but with the RGB version it
actually comes with 4 case fans 3 in the
front and one in the back so like you're
totally fine for airflow they're not
crazy fancy fans or anything but I've
already built in this case and it's
perfectly adequate a good deal for about
65 dollars for a power supply in this
range you should be looking for an 80
plus bronze rated units and I recommend
about a 550 watt power supply you can go
a little bit higher than that if you
want but thanks to the rebate on this
one you can get it for 40 bucks
it's a Corsair power supply so it's
well-built it's partially modular so you
can remove the cables if you're not
going to use them and the cables
themselves are all black those are kind
of all the basics that you want in a
power supply 40 bucks you should be able
to get a good deal on that
so assemble those six components you're
coming in at less than $500 I think
you're off and running with a very solid
gaming PC and you could potentially up
created so moving on to the upgraded
version this one's about $900 and this
one we've upgraded the CPU to a risin
520 600 so you're going from a four core
four thread processor to a six core 12
thread processor since this one does
have SMT enabled and the CPU is usually
165 dollars but you can actually get it
for a hundred and fifty bucks from
Amazon right now apparently which is a
great deal and if you're trying to
compare it to other CPUs that you might
get in this range I feel like the next
step up would be the 2600 X that's $50
more though beyond that you could look
at something like a 1700 X which gives
you more cores and threads but xfr with
the 2000 series of Rison processors or
extended frequency range kind of the
automatic overclocking works a little
bit better and single core performance
is going to get you better gaming
performance overall so that's why I'd
tend to lean towards the 2000 series
CPUs especially with this deal in the
2600 the one drawback for the 2600 is it
comes with the Wraith stealth cooler
which is a little bit smaller it's not
going to be as good for overclocking in
the future so you might consider
upgrading that down the line
you could easily get something like a
hyper 212 to drop in there instead and
you'd have much better cooling
performance and maybe get yourself a
little bit more overclocking too now the
2600 is not an APU it does not have any
graded graphics so we need a graphics
card as well and the r-tx 2060 from
Nvidia is the best bang for the buck at
about a 350 dollar price point right now
there's even some price Wars going on
that are taking them down to a few
dollars less than $350 but an
aftermarket version like this one from
gigabyte is going to be a solid choice
for you unless you want to of course
upgrade it I will admit that when I
actually built this system I totally had
a brain fart and I installed the wrong
graphics card it's got an RT X 2080 or
in it right now so stay tuned for the
video where I sort of explain how I got
that wrong and of course with any
graphics card like this it's easier to
swap in or swap out so you could put in
RTX 2080 with this build but this is
probably a little bit more suited for
the high end intel build that I'm going
to show you next so here's the $1500
build I went with an i7 8700 K rather
than the 9000 series simply because it's
a little bit less expensive at 360
dollars and it has hyper-threading so
you get six cores and twelve threads if
you compare this to like the 9700 K it
is an 8 core processor but it's about 50
bucks more and it
have hyper-threading and in either case
you're going to need an aftermarket CPU
cooler as well more on that in just a
second but I also want to point out that
with this price at $1500 this is with an
RT X 2070 which you can get for about
$500 right now if you were to upgrade
that to an RT X 2080 you would want to
get an aftermarket version that you keep
for about $700 and it would raise the
entire price of this build up to about
$1,700 which is totally up to you it's
just a matter if you want to spend an
extra 200 bucks for a bit more graphics
performance but let's go over the parts
individually we have the i7 8700 K which
you can get for about 360 bucks right
now on Amazon you probably do want a
reality check the prices on the 9700 K
before you drop your cash on this the
9700 K is going for about four hundred
and ten dollars right now so I think for
a $50 savings the 8700 K is worth it and
you'll get about equivalent gaming
performance especially if you overclock
the 8700 K but you should be able to do
because I've dropped in and aftermarket
all in one liquid cooler any aftermarket
240 millimeter all-in-one liquid CPU
cooler that costs around hundred dollars
should serve you just fine here as long
as it's well reviewed of course make
sure it's not one of those budget
variants I have used this specific
cooler before and it comes with you know
some fancy addressable RGB LEDs and
everything it's a good cooler so that's
why I chose it I totally forgot to point
out this is a mini ITX bill but this is
a mini ITX build I wanted to make this
one a little bit different since it is a
little bit higher end so I chose this
motherboard the asus rog Strix z 390 - i
gaming this is about a $200 motherboard
it's very small but it packs a lot of
features like you get both addressable
and non addressable RGB LED headers you
get a USB 3.1 gen2 front panel connector
you get dual MDOT two slots one on the
front that has a heatsink as well as one
on the back and it's got a fixed IO
shield which I really like for memory I
was trying to keep some parity between
this build and a less expensive one so
still have 16 gigs 2 by 8 gig sticks
ddr4 3200 memory but I went with the
team Nighthawk memory which is fancy and
includes RGB lighting so you're spending
about an extra 15 bucks for that fancy
RGB lighting and look but it's a fancier
higher-end build so that's why I chose
that I still stuck with a 500 gig $50.00
SATA SSD for this build although I was
very torn between that and spending
something like 30 bucks more or so on a
500 gig nvme
SD that might have much faster read and
write speeds in the end I was trying to
hit the $1500 price point so that's why
I decided to go with what I did but
definitely keep nvme SSDs in mind
because they will be a little bit faster
for you for a graphics card I went with
the GeForce r-tx 20 78 gig gaming this
should cost about $500 but you can get
it on sale right now 10% off at Newegg
this is an aftermarket card from
gigabyte with a triple fan cooler and
for about 500 bucks it's hard to get
anything better than this at the moment
rounding things out our case is the NZXT
h 200 i which is a little on the large
size for a mini ITX case but only about
130 dollars so for a nicer case it's not
going in the 150 or $200 range it's also
well designed well built it's not
terribly difficult to build in and it
looks pretty cool this is the white
version finally for a power supply the
EVGA supernova g3 and this is pretty
much the same as the less expensive
builds power supply it's just 650 watts
instead of 550 a + gold-certified
instead of bronze it is fully modular
rather than partially modular and for
all of those upgraded features you're
probably gonna spend about 30 or 40
bucks more so shoot you should be able
to find this for about $70 so guys
that's my monthly builds video for
February 2019 and whether you want to
spend 500 bucks 900 bucks 1500 bucks or
more pick your poison hopefully these
builds lets you choose the parts that
you want to use and of course feel free
to swap things out and make it more
personalized to you if you so desire and
of course stay tuned for my three-part
series on how to build a PC which is
coming out like very soon thank you
again for watching this video thumbs up
button on your way out we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
