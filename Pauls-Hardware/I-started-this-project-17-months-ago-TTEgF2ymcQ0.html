pretty pretty early for me to be
starting a video today but I have a few
things to do I think you guys might be
interested and hopefully excited because
today I'm finally continuing my long
awaited htpc video now it has been like
a year and a half since I actually put
this thing together and it's been
sitting here doing a fine job but not
looking very pretty it's just sitting on
top of a subwoofer it's dusty
I've added stuff on like this there's a
blu-ray drive there but the original
plan was something that looks a little
bit nicer and maybe it's a little bit
more put together and more
professionally done than this so for
that I got a piece of wood the piece of
wood is walnut it's over here by my
fireplace and the plan was to mount the
computer components to this mount this
to the wall of course sand it and if
it's some stain on it to finish it and
everything so it look pretty but what I
discovered after bringing it home was
this tiny little piles of wood dust and
that's coming from tiny little holes on
the wood itself and that is caused from
wood beetles and actually I don't want
anything that has wood beetles in it
attached to a wall in my house and
there's two ways to deal with this one
is with chemicals and we don't want to
deal with that the other is to kill nuts
or put it into an oven for an extended
period of time now my oven is much too
small for this so we're gonna take it
back to where we got it tool peak timber
have them kiln it for us then we'll pick
it up in a few days and then we can
actually move on with this project but
first I have to go to the dentist
looks like I'll be coming back to take
care of that
in my defense that's a that's a filling
and the fillings old so I've got some
stuff around the filling never mind
let's let's go get wood
my teeth are nice and clean now nice and
polished and I just talked to rob from
tule peak and he's good to go for today
so I now have like an hour and a half
drive and then I can drop my walnut off
well I made it here Rob wasn't feeling
very photogenic today though so he asked
me not to film which I always respect
when people ask that so I dropped off
the wood
now I get to head home and we're gonna
follow up and once it's ready we'll come
back and pick it up an exciting day so
far
lots of driving this week a bit bumpy
transition alright guys since last shots
about a week has gone by go home and now
we're driving back and now Joe is here
as well so go pick up the slab and also
maybe buy some additional pieces cuz I'm
gonna put some shelves in too
Joe stop filming this I just get carsick
thank you hey guys the walnut slab has
been recovered kilns that is now wood
beetle free so very happy about that we
also have a bit of pigment here we're
not going to use the pigment for this
walnut piece we're gonna use it for some
shelves that I'm also picking up here
and here are what is hopefully gonna
become shelves in the future this is
English walnuts these P pieces have not
been killed yet so if I hadn't already
warned you guys that this is gonna be a
two part video it's gonna be a two part
video because I'm going to come back
here actually probably in a few weeks to
pick these back up once they've been
killed I'm gonna turn them into shelves
I picked them specifically because they
have this wider part here which will
hopefully be enough space for the
receiver to sit on so that's exciting
but more on that in a future video for
now let's get back to the original
walnut slab so our walnut piece here
should now be free of wood beetles which
is super nice and I think we're gonna go
with this side so plans for today to get
ourselves to a point where I feel like
things have been accomplished other than
taking this back to tule peak timber and
back is to go over the sides and for
that we have this piece here we're gonna
use a drill take off any excess wood
along the edge and we might leave some
of this we're gonna see how it stays on
and how the finish will look with that
and we're going to take an orbital
sander to this to just get the rough
parts nice and smooth you can still see
some of the little holes here from the
wood beetles but that would be little
 all be dead in there and then
finally we're gonna hit it with this
unearthed naked floor hard wax oil and
that should be all it takes to get a
real nice finish on this and bringing
out a lot of the hidden texture and
beauty of this walnut
again positive tell me to bring another
shirt do you know where you're doing
today good job they're so fragile
why'd you stop Joe well we have an
endangered species so I'm just gonna
leave them alone patchouli decides to
leave oh well I guess I have to go home
now can't work and believe this
fauna no flora this is fauna what I was
trying to say is that I believe that
this wood has already been properly
inseminated it's not the right word
since emanate it pollinated pollinated
that's what bees do anyway I think you'd
be friend go before and after Joe just
finished the first sanding with sixty
grit we got 100 grit and then 150 grit
and we're hoping we don't need to go and
pick up 220 grit because I don't have
any 220 grit for my orbital sander and
the meantime though I haven't gone over
the edges I think I'm gonna leave a
little bit of this stuff on but I'm
taking off most of the larger chunks and
yeah things looking good
yeah you're not supposed to be out here
you're breathing in dust okay finally
applying the oil to this we're starting
with the edges and this is entirely
based on Joe's advice could see his is
done work in this area before have you
done before Joe woodworking cabinet
restoration antiques all that stuff is
that a new move right there I got this
line across the bottom
well guys I hate to leave you here but
this has already been two weeks into
this video and I have more work to do on
this and I know I'm not going to finish
anytime soon so I hope this is giving
you guys back some of what you've been
asking for which is a follow-up on the
htpc video I got more we're coming on
this I'm really really happy with how
everything's going so far I've got the
shelves coming up soon as well
but that's going to wrap it up for this
video the last thing I'm going to be
doing is taking my oily rag and laying
it out in the sunshine so that it can
dry out and we won't have any auto
ignition problems before we toss it
because if you're working with oil auto
ignition of the rags you use is a major
problem it can happen lay it flat open
so it can dry it in the Sun and then
once it's completely dried out then you
can throw them away you can also leave
them submerge it in a bucket of water if
you don't have a sunny area to leave
them in but that's all the time I have
for now thank you guys so much for
watching this video thumbs up button if
you enjoyed it and I'll be back with
more videos soon in 2018 Happy New Year
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
