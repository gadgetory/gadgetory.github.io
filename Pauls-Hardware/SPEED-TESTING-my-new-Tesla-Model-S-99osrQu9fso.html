first showed up just that it was
extremely large also by the way we are
doing like a bunch of clean up and
organizing out here which is why it's
messy just had to make an excuse there
at first I thought it was like because
it has this logo on it
that's Radio Flyer I thought somebody
who knew that my wife and I are about to
have a baby sent us over like a cart
what do you call those cart wagon yes a
wagon but then I remembered oh yeah I
have a tesla powerwall and solar setup
and I did some videos on that and I put
my referral link in them and my referral
link had the ability for people to click
on it and buy stuff and some people buy
some power walls and some solar stuff I
had a few of those and there was
actually a couple sales of Tesla
vehicles which is kind of surprised that
so a big thank you to anyone who used my
referral link if you have if you got a
Tesla product and you're happy with it I
hope you are because it allowed me to
order this let me show you what it is
yeah what you doing this is the Tesla
Model S for kids made by Radio Flyer
larger than I was expecting as you can
see four-door model I love that it's got
these folded in side view mirrors that's
pretty cool and it comes of course with
some accessories so here we have the
battery itself flight speed looks like
it's got a little power indicator around
the top there so you know how much juice
you got left interfaces at the bottom
and this just slots into the back here
you got to lift up here your lid there
for your trunk and I don't think this is
charged yet but just gonna pop it in
like so snap okay perfect
right here you've got your speed mode
control that is secured with a Philips
head screw driver so you know daddy's
got a switch that speed one or speed two
mode 1 will go 2.5 to 3 miles per hour
mode 2 will go 5 point 5 to 6 miles per
hour so about a nine point seven km/h
top speed on this one which is right up
there with them with the regular Model S
I think we get a shiny founders license
plate there at the back p90d model there
for Model S I wasn't sure if this is
gonna come charge but it looks like we
do have 2 out of 5 bars at least so
we're not gonna need to plug this in
quite yet at least hopefully we can get
a quick test run here's our Tesla wall
charger just got a little plug there for
the battery side AC coupe wrong pretty
standard also included here we've got
the leather bucket seats I'm not sure if
that's leather but definitely a bucket
seat that's super plush and of course
our fancy Tesla steering wheel there it
is with I would just these would usually
be probably media controls or something
like that
Oh even got a horn and it'll interface
there to connect up to the vehicle
itself I'm not gonna put this on quite
yet cuz I wanted to show some of the
features in here here at the back we
have our electric motor which has lots
of horsepower up at the front we have
some controls so you'll notice you can
turn the headlights on or off with this
button here over on the right side here
we got your forward and reverse controls
yeah
pedal down here and then they've
actually got a little pouch for a music
player which I thought was a nice add-on
doesn't have bluetooth but he got an aux
cable there that plugs in there so this
must have some speakers mounted up in
here of course one of the great
advantages of an electric vehicle like
this you you don't need all that space
for the engine so look at all the
storage space you got up there you're
gonna go on a family trip something like
that press that like three times a bunch
of time no measure though like 20
throughout the day I'm hungry do you
think here
nice nice new ride this is all that
really comes with accessories and this
is a safety measure basically the lock
the steering wheel in place okay so
obviously we gotta give it a little bit
of a time trial here a bit of a test run
unfortunately nobody here is qualified
to drive this class of vehicle the
weight limit is 81 pounds
unfortunately I weigh in a little bit
more than that right now Joe is only
like 85 but you know he's gonna be
running the camera so we gotta give him
that so we got our driver here mr.
elefante I'm gonna be just to the side
with a long stick which I will be using
to push the gas pedal down like that and
we'll test in position one in position
two and see how much of a speed boost
you get by overclocking the Model S for
kids
that's the finish line right here this
crack Eddie you have to do it countdown
3 2 1 go yes nari I know I know
oh yeah SP you wanna that's speed 1 I
believe this is how you switch to
ludicrous mode 3 2 1 go okay yes it's
fast wow that's hard take you up with 3
2 1 go
uh-uh no airbags that's definitely
something that should be added it's
definitely fast so guys that is pretty
much gonna wrap it up for my initial
test testing testing testing of the
Tesla Model S for kids out here in the
backyard with my tesla powerwall which
just seems appropriate as you can see by
those a B comparisons switching it into
ludicrous speed mode gives you a big
boost and I recommend running in that
mode as much as you possibly can I'm
looking forward to testing this out with
an actual small human rather than our
crash-test dummy right here but stay
tuned maybe for more on that in the
future you guys hit the thumbs up button
let me know what you think of this video
my new little Model S and we'll see you
guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
