400,000 subscriber giveaway video and I
want to start off just by saying to any
of you who have subscribed to my channel
to any of you who have watched my videos
especially to any of you who have left
comments or feedback thumbs ups all that
good stuff I am eternally grateful to
you I am constantly humbled by the fact
that people come and watch my channel
and I there's just no way that I could
do any of this without you guys so I
just wanted to say a huge thank you to
everyone out there and I wanted to do a
little bit of something to give back so
for that purpose I have this giveaway
today which is actually two giveaways in
one let's do the quick version up front
here and not to be confused with the
international $1,500 giveaway that Kyle
and I just did last week which just
ended also by the way if you want to
know who won that check out my twitter i
will be posting that very soon probably
should be up there already by the time
you watch this video but two items are
going to be giving given away here the
first this is sapphire nitroplus radeon
RX for eighty eight gig graphics card
this will be available internationally
wherever it is legal and not prohibited
by law or anything like that you can win
this and there is a gleamed IO link in
the description for that one second
giveaway item is a Corsair RM 1000 I
special edition corsair has made this
power supply to celebrate that they have
been making power supplies for 10 years
and the days off also just recently sold
their 10 millionth power supplies so
they made a special edition of the RM
1000 I it is all white it comes with
specialized cabling and this giveaway
will be available to North American
entrants so if you happen to enter for
the arm 1000 I give away and you are
outside of the North American area which
is basically us in Canada you are not
going to be eligible but you will be
eligible for the international giveaway
of the RX 480 nitroplus from sapphire
this card has some pretty cool features
including a custom-designed cooler by
sapphire it comes over clocked out of
the box you will get the OC edition and
the eight gig version not the four gig
version v are already directx 12 HDR
support all that good stuff and I like
what they've done with the cooler
on this card they have a 3d version here
on the website you can spin it all
around and see see stuff but also the
cooling design as well as the fans and I
really like that the fans can just pop
out and be replaced if one fails or
anything like that it also has a RGB LED
on it so you can change the color of the
Sapphire logo on the side to match with
your LEDs in your case or your color or
anything like that so if you want to

RM 1000 eyes special edition power
supply from Corsair you can also click
