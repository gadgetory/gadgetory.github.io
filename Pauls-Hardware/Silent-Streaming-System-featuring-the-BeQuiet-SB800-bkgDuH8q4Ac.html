Paul's hardware I am doing a build video
today that's right and just just like a
regular build video there's no modding
going on or customization I'm using
off-the-shelf parts
this one's been kind of a long time
coming because I actually got this be
quiet silent base 800 case well a few
months ago now and I've been planning a
build in it so I've got the the case
here I'm going to kind of focus on the
case for this video but I also of course
have some parts from gigabyte so let's
rest to the component so I'm going to
start off kind of run down each one of
these tell you what I'm using this for
and why I chose each part I'm going to
be using this for live streaming by the
way I will go ahead and do a full build
all kind of time-lapse through all that
and then at the end I'm going to come
back and give some feedback on the build
experience in to be quiet silent based
800 case as well as my experience with
some of the other components I've used
today
so for parts of course I started out
this build with the silent beta 800 and
the straight power 10 700 watt both from
be quiet so I'm going to come back to
those and give you guys a closer look
the graphics card is right here and this
is from gigabyte this is their g1 gaming
geforce gtx 960 so that means it looks
pretty high-end because it's the g1
gaming series so it looks very similar
to their 970 and their 980 i don't
necessarily need a ton of graphics
horsepower for this build in particular
that said there's a chance i might swap
this out in the future with something a
little bit more powerful but for the
time being what i'm actually going to be
doing is feeding video over to this
system via capture card so i'll be
playing on a couple water-cooled 2
gigabyte gtx 980 g1 gaming cards from
from the arctic panther build moving
along though we also from gigabyte have
the z97 X SOC you might have seen this
in my first 5 things I do when I'm
shopping for a motherboard video this is
a z97 board it's also very orange and
it's going to match very well also
full-featured boards so should get the
job done
CPU at the center is going to be an i7
4770k I don't know if anyone is like
using this video as a build guide but if
you're buying new I would get a 4790k
the 4770k I already had so I didn't
really feel like it was
- by the 4790k just for the sake of this
anyway I did that dumb since it's a
streaming system I wanted the quad-core
plus the hyper threading for memory I
have repurposed a kit that already had
this is an 8 gig 2 by 4 gig kits of
Corsair Vengeance it's just ddr3 1600
for an SSD I have an Intel 240 gig and
totally I forget the model this it's a
model of assess SD it's one of those
ones from Intel it like it's very simple
in design anyway this is a sand force
controlled SSD and again that one's kind
of repurposed from another system I've
had I've had that one for a little bit a
couple little add-on items here I of
course have this Blackmagic capture card
this is the same card I've been using
that we've been using to stream awesome
hardware and that sort of thing so I'm
going to be popping that into this
system since it will be dedicated for
streaming it will also finally have a
bit more of a home and then lastly I'm
going to be throwing in this thermal
take water 2.0 a CPU cooler since
there's actually not even a CPU cooler
in this box name in a stock one I used
it for something else
so this also has already been used but
I'm going to be cleaning it off and then
installing it to keep the CPU cool and
maybe do a little bit of overclocking as
well since it's the super overclocked
z97 X motherboard so here's a closer
look at the power supply this is be
quiet straight power 10 this is a pretty
much everything that comes with it our
cable of course it is semi modular so
you get these cables I will say the blue
plugs are not necessarily my super
favorite but there's no side panel
window on this case so not to be seeing
too much of that anyway there's your
modular cables side-by-side you do have
a always attached 24 pin main
motherboard power connector so that one
is always stick on there but um you're
probably going to need that so not a
huge deal modular connection points are
down here they're all clearly labeled on
the top you have a large be quiet fan
and it is a quiet fan it just it doesn't
just say be quiet on there some metal
grilling across the top and then other
than that pretty flat black finish be
quiet logo on that side nothing on the
bottom not a whole lot going on on that
side
and then there's your power chart and
all that good stuff so this does have
three rails to 89.1 22f so bear that in
mind if you're looking for something for
something like I don't know say an hour
nine 295x2 other than that though it is
very efficient 80 plus gold rated and a
pretty decent price for that and again
this is a 700 watt model and this should
get us by just fine
other than that though our case requires
some little bit of assembly I did get
out of the box there but let me pop
these feet on the bottom so I can stand
it up a bit more stable II and then
we'll look at that these little feet
just kind of pop in like that and here's
a quick look at the case before I start
jumping in with the build itself so you
can see this one has orange trim it's
also available with kind of a gray or
silver trim and black interior is nice
and spacious it has some distinctive
kind of orange markings inside as well
as out it has a swinging door on the
front that you can open up to reveal
your five and a quarter inch expansion
bays front panel also will pop off like
so it's got some rubber protection on
there you can see you got a couple
hundred and forty millimeter be clad
fans in the front this is 120 that comes
pre-installed in the back more features
after I actually put hardware in this
one so I'm going to get going
I began to build confident in the
decisions I have made for the parts in
my epic orange streaming system little
did I know how wrong I actually was but
that can wait because it's time to say
thank you to this video sponsor
lynda.com let me ask you this what other
website is dedicated to making you
smarter if you didn't already know
lynda.com is an online or learning
platform with over 3,000 on-demand video
courses to help you strengthen your
business technology and creative skills
and via the sponsorship promotion you
can get a 10 day free trial that is
absolutely correct and you can do this
simply by visiting lynda.com/tekzilla
Indicom but I talk about that all the
time so why don't you guys go ahead and
learn something else on Lynda like audio
and music software for example go ahead
and learn audacity audition Cubase FL
Studio GarageBand Logic Pro Pro Tools
and reason just to name a few of the
courses they have on there and then use
those skills to make me some better
background music maybe maybe classes
placed up a little bit what do you think
if you do want to do this go ahead and
click the spots or link in this video's
description or visit linda.com slash
pulp but back to my cliffhanger from
before was something about my
overconfidence being my undoing I
believe and I will say that things did
not go quite as smoothly as I would have
liked with this build my main dilemma
was the CPU cooler of course and since I
don't actually have one it'd be quiets
excellent air coolers around for this
bill I went with an all-in-one instead
now I also wanted to keep the rad and
the fans in this lower chamber down here
rather than the upper area up here
because this top panel can restrict some
of the airflow and I wanted to avoid
that if possible now you probably saw
that my first planned unit was the
thermal take water 2.0 a cooler with a
240 millimeter radiator that is thicker
than most which meant that I didn't have
quite enough clearance for the fans and
the radiator which conflicted with my
RAM slots another point to make here is
that my older model Corsair Vengeance
memory has kind of absurdly tall heat
spreaders which Linda limited my options
a bit further I probably could have fit
the water 2.0 with some low or lower
profile dims in there
but I gotta work with what I have so
next I took a shot at installing the
corsair h 110 a larger 280 millimeter
all-in-one unit with a thinner radiator
and here again I probably could have
made it work by removing the front
optical drive cage maybe planning ahead
a bit more to but spacing wise you
really do run out of room quickly if you
don't want to put the fans in the top
area up above which I didn't want to do
so I scrapped the h 110 plans as well
third time was a charm though I pulled
the cooler master depth in 240 M out of
another system and it fit in perfectly
with the fans mounted at all so the
biggest hurdle of this build was
overcome everything else went very
smoothly I'm happy to say after some
work getting all the parts in place
wrangling the cables I had the finished
build that you now see before you I'm
going to focus on the straight power 10
700 watt power supply again for just a
moment this guy got the job done I like
80 plus gold units for the efficiency at
a lower price than you often pay for the
premium that you have to pay for
platinum units 700 watts gives some good
Headroom and you can even handle two-way
GPU configurations with this power
supply depending on the graphics card of
course and the housing has a nice finish
and a be quiet embossed logo on the side
and a very quiet fan as well partially
modular designs are helpful too but on
the downside the cables just aren't
really all that attractive they suffer
from the multicolored wiring barely
hidden by loose sleeping problem that so
many PSU suffer from and there's just no
hiding the burst of color at the end of
the 24 24 pin connector the fact that
the peg connectors have this kind of
bright blue translucent 6 + 2 pin
connectors was also a little bit
baffling to me it really stands out I'll
be honest I'd recommend some sleeved
extensions for this power supply if it's
if aesthetics are a concern for you of
course lastly it is a multi rail design
with four 12-volt rails on the 700 watt
model which is fine for most situations
except those unique ones like when
you're using an AMD r9 295x2 for example
or a similar GPU that requires a lot of
amps on a single rail to provide enough
juice on the associated connector so
bear that in mind moving on to the
silent Bass 800 case though on the plus
side I really do like the design it's
quite pleasing to look at and it has at
all kind of skinny
look to it if you're viewing it from the
front it's also very quiet and the sound
dampening and the padding material
throughout is high-quality and does a
really good job reducing internal noise
I also like the included fans 240
millimeters at the front and the 120 at
the back give you adequate airflow for
most builds and it kind of emphasizes
positive air fresh pressure by having
this two large intake fans which is
almost always preferred I also had
plenty of room for all of my hardware
with the exception of the radiator
issues I already mentioned and one other
minor note is that I had to remove the
middle drive cage up here in order to
fit my gigabyte gtx 960 which is a
pretty long graphics card for today's
market I also wanted to point out that
the side panels which are held by
catches on the top and bottom edges
which isn't a design that I usually
prefer I usually actually find it kind
of tiring putting the panels on and
taking them off but thanks to the way
the panels are actually designed they're
a bit thicker thanks to the roll edges
the edges wrap around and they become
flush with the rest of the case so
putting it on and taking it off is
actually a bit easier than other panels
that use this design on the negative
side for the SB 888 er up to there and
bringing those radiator fans inside the
motherboard chamber can be awkward
depending on the hardware configuration
in there and what memory you have what
motherboard you have of course now if
you've got a standard 240 millimeter
radiator like mine you'll probably be
okay but I also had some disappointment
with a damaged on a rival piece actually
the front cover right up here or the 140
intakes had a broken plastic tab at the
bottom the tab broken piece is actually
on the case itself below the else good
yeah see that broke a plastic bit broke
fortunately it still stays on okay when
I put it on but it looks pretty bad when
I pop it off I have to say that I've
seen this happen on quite a few cases or
sir I'm looking at you right here and I
would love to see a solution for these
removable front panels that doesn't rely
on an easily breakable tiny plastic tab
for a hinge all that said though I'm
happy to say that the silent base 800
gets the job done very well it looks
good it fits all the hardware
there's modularity and the drive cages
and the side intakes on the panels and
yes it remains very quiet with the
system up and running so it definitely
lives up to its name now I wanted this
build to look good inside and out even
if there's no side panel window which is
why I chose the gigabyte z97 X SOC
because it's orange black it matches so
well and the key ended g1 gaming GTX 960
and I suppose since I'm making this
video there's also plenty of enough
opportunity for you guys to appreciate
it with side panel off but what do you
guys think would you be interested in a
windowed side panel version of the
silent bass 800 if be quiet made it also
