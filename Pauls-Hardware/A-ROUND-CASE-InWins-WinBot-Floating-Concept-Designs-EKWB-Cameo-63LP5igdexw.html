to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster guys every year I like to
stop at in wind booths because they
always have something crazy something
eye-catching in something just way up
side the realm of what any practical
CPUs and would actually want to build a
system in so I think they have a massive
globular case that's all see-through and
it takes pictures of you let's go check
it out let's start out over here because
this case is freaking obvious this is
just to name one 8:06 which indicates
has been out before but they have a
completely wood or metal version in the
15 I love this combination of the wood
finish and a technology inside I like
the contrast with silver I offer from
the top evanwan logo we can attach the
burned into the wood on the front of it
I've kind of been considering like the
Fedak case that has kind of wood
integrated to it to be a really awesome
idea for quite a while Jenny actually
said as I was talking to her before as
we did this video that's something that
she's wanted for quite a while to know
anyway good job and they don't say I
hope you guys actually bring this one
out too much there's also a gaming cube
a one over here that also has what I
thought why is it missing madam to help
to here's an interesting build it is
called the floating so I guess if you
want to make a case and make it an
unpainted an amount of case or something
like that you should just put all the
components outside the gate instead of
inside but basically this is an aluminum
aluminum and separ glass open hair
chassis is what they're calling it
there's two 2.5 inch bays in this case
and that is definitely something that
I'm if you want to criticize in wins
that they're not only super practice
when it comes to these things we're
going to build this together here on
your finish on one side it's got us a
teepee a creative block the support the
ATX motherboard as well as 105
millimeter fan by three on the one side
as an ax 350 millimeter radiator
the other side as you can see they
haven't amazing-looking water-cooled
systems that they put together in this
right now
we Zane was the actual guy who made it
here's a computer scientist there's this
picture good job we really really good
job
beautiful bill there's also a sort of a
touch panel with a display although I
don't think it's quite reporting
properly right now but still really
cool-looking so a bit of more
practicality with the power button there
as well as switching between fan modes
or different lighting mode so again very
interesting concept case here called
floating from human but what a dick the
hex key this is the wind box it's a big
circle I guess how much in here a
hamster ball is the expression of this
give me there should become some kind of
robot history of everything for my
understanding powering it they also have
a strange setup that's another further
down over there where they have this
thing in its robotic and it opens up and
there's like except there's a big
picture I guess and that booth people
are going in and that this is the big
circular case he's taking that picture
and let it to flip it on the screen
seems like kind of a glorified photo
booths if you have to me so not perhaps
the most practical use of something like
a crazy high in water for build this
thing I mean it's insane
I've never seen a case like this and I
tend to say that every time I come to
see England's that the copy' fence
because they just do stuff you've never
really seen before again beautiful water
cool bull water cool builds and solving
this thing this was made by three modest
and as far as the case goes it does
support ehem caffeine it's made out of
aluminum and exfoliant sofas Vegas
wall and Siva got tons of a air-cooling
support front hundred and twenty
millimeter fan by three we're headed to
a twenty millimeter fan by two and a
hunch three hundred sixty millimeter
radiators which is currently equipped
with in this water cold version of the
build so you guys think I should try to
get one of these no idea where I put it
where do you put a massive acrylic ball
case I'm not sure I'll take it up and
closing out the end when booth senuke
project ek is kind of partnering with
England they just have a little set up
here and this is the new ek fluid gaming
setup basically ek has gone a little bit
of they're using extruded covers for the
GPU block using all aluminum in the
actual system so you're going to get
depending on a system that you get set
up either 120 millimeter radiator 240 or
you can get this one on the bottom which
includes the radiator as well as a CPU
block as well as the GPU block which is
compatible with most founders Edition
1080 and 1070 series GPUs
since everything is aluminum that's
basically less expensive yes you're
going to lose some silly performance so
for people who like 8a i/o who don't
want to do anything with a iOS because a
i/o suck this might be a much more
viable solution for you you can tell
just in the weight of these things that
you know it's aluminum and not copper or
brass or anything like that but I think
it's going to let a lot of more people
get into the water cooling game
especially with you know the quality of
nak brings to the table which is which
is pretty substantial and that one on
the bottom which gives you again a GPU
block the CPU block a pump the reservoir
and the tubing and everything you need
to put this all together there's only
gonna cost how much is it get a cop 240
dollars
I don't care about that one no that
would be fifty doing this book a 240 put
a source 140 160 to 1440 all right very
good spices so guys check it out new
weekend products for water cooling
fanatics
go get all right I got one last thing to
show you guys come and win this is a
pretty unique fan it's called Mars
so they've named these Mars I honestly
don't know why they're called Mars
because maybe it's because I read but
basically you got a fan with an aluminum
chassis rotational speed up to 1,400 rpm
and it's Jeff that's kind of armed that
it's attached to and you can just move
it around rotate it position it wherever
you want direct airflow towards a
graphics card or hot spot in your case
and I would imagine particularly useful
in an open air check you like the end wa
next frame that they have right here
there's a 2.0 it's definitely that
covered last year maybe a before I
forget but I gotta fall for this video
really hope you've enjoyed it if you did
hit the thumbs up button I got more time
to 6.77 coming very soon as we'll also
also subscribe if you want to one final
shot to my sponsors of course big THANK
YOU to g.skill Coolermaster EVGA MSI and
Tesoro I'll see you guys in the next
