coverage here from Las Vegas Nevada this
I believe is my last video covering this
event so if you've enjoyed my coverage
so far hit the thumbs up button thumbs
up button let me know cuz it's been a
it's been a long week we've got a lot
done but it's been good times with good
friends and good people like like Steve
here he's been joining us Steve is
playing on the doom demo going on behind
me but I'm getting ahead of myself I
need to start off by thanking my
sponsors gigabytes deep cool as well as
ocz a Toshiba Company thanks to you guys
for sponsoring my CES 2017 coverage and
if you guys are watching and want to say
thanks to them click their links down in
the video's description below now since
we're at AMD we of course are gonna talk
about two things
Zen now known as Rison if you're looking
at the chips that's actually going to be
sold to people and Vega and start let's
start with Vega
why don't we since they're actually
showing off this demo finally what Steve
is doing is playing Doom in 4k that's
running on the Vulcan API and he's doing
so with a rise in CPU the eight core 16
thread chip that they've already been
talking about and teasing and showing
some performance of and a Vega graphics
card so based on the Vega architecture
we know nothing beyond that as far as
additional specs there is some
information that has just recently
launched about Vega and it's really a
little bit too much for me to dive into
for this type of video but let's just
say there's a lot of excitement around
it but we don't we still don't know when
it's going to come out but we at least
know that it works this system is like
completely enclosed and taped up there's
a little bit of fan intake at the front
but as a result they have the fan on the
actual GPU and they're running at a
hundred percent but it's managing to hit
60 to 70 sometimes upwards of 70 frames
per second at 4k and that's pretty
insane cuz doom is a challenging game to
run even if you're using the Vulcan API
and it's good to know that we already
have live demos of Vega achieving this
type of performance in this type of game
so it's going to be an excellent
successor to Polaris we already know but
more information hopefully will be
coming out soon from AMD like pricing
and availability
to come out and what types of chips or
based on it and stuff but let's move on
because we have more risin stuff too we
actually have a m4 motherboards look
guys actual a m4 motherboards I believe
these are going to be close to the
finished product but there might still
be some changes going on and I'm
starting off over on this window because
these are motherboards that are maybe
from vendors that are a little bit less
common or maybe you haven't heard quite
as much from before biostar you've
probably heard of they're around in the
US although not quite as well known as
say MSI are Asus or gigabytes but they
have a couple boards here they look like
they're going with a racing theme but
you can see some of the information
about a m4 just by looking at it of
course the socket itself right up there
and what we now know about the aim for
socket it is you are going to need to
potentially upgrade your CPU cooler if
you go for this if you want to try to
use one of your older coolers now the
good news is if you're using one of the
typical AMD coolers that uses the
latches or the little clips the caches
that are on the top and bottom there you
can still reuse that so the stock ones
will still work the difference is the
bolts where they go through the board on
the top and the bottom are now a little
bit wider so if you have a CPU cooler
that requires a back plates you're going
to need to basically update the mounting
solution so some CPU cooler vendors are
actually updating their existing CPU
coolers and some of them like we already
know Noctua
will just like send you out a new
bracket for yours which is cool so good
guy Noctua giving you an upgrade for
your CPU cooler and you don't need to
buy it a completely new one of course if
you have something like a wraith you can
just drop it right in there there's
another one from biostar this is a be
350 gt3 the one we were looking up up
here is I believe an X 370 chips that
although I've completely lost track of
where the title is who cares we'll move
on anyway down here we have this one
which I do know is an X 370 this is the
Biostar X 370gt 7 and we're going to see
on these motherboards is like new and
modern features with support for things
like m2 we've seen some u dot two slots
on some of these as well the information
on the rise in chip itself we
you already know of course it's 8-core
sixteenth read it's gonna have a three
point four gigahertz base clock and a
turbo boost that we are still not sure
of they're not letting us know exactly
but it's gonna have that extreme
automatic overclocking thing I forget
the name of it right off the bat but as
part of the sense of my suite and it
will automatically overclock your cpu
based on what the temperature is that
it's running at so it will detect if you
upgrade your cooler for example and then
just automatically juice up the clock
speed and make it a little bit faster
this motherboard is a MSB 350 FX gaming
Pro it's made by a company called max
Sun which I believe is located in China
and I don't think they distribute to the
US which is probably why I've never
heard that heard of them before
and then finally down here we have
another motherboard really of
indeterminate origin although again I
think this is from this is from China
because there are some Chinese
characters down in there over here we
have as rock as rock you've heard of of
course they are they're great company
they make lots of cool stuff including
this one which has a big Intel logo on
it right there in cells Gigabit Ethernet
jet that was kind of funny it's like
it's not an Intel board it's an AMD
board it's a m4 yeah yeah they got Intel
gig gonna be Gigabit Ethernet but this
is the X 370 Taichi keep it with the
same sort of design aesthetic
black-and-white look as their existing
Taichi boards with the kind of cool
imprinted design there on the
motherboard itself I like it you'll
probably notice that all these
motherboards will they have DIMM slots
of course but they do support dual
channel ddr3 that's also been confirmed
for Rison and then there's going to be a
ton of options when it comes to the
chipsets so here's another asrock board
this is an a320 em pro for yet another
example of some of the chipset sort of
it available for Reisen a320 is gonna be
slightly lower end and will not enable
overclocking all of the rise in CPUs
will be overclocking enabled but they'll
kind of differentiate how much you can
or should overclock based on the chipset
that's going in there so the be 350 will
be an overclocking chipset the X 370
will be an overclocking chipset the
lower-end ones like a 320 will not allow
overclocking so depending on whether or
not you want to overclock or how much
you want to
spend on your motherboard will
significantly change which chips that
you want to go for it now another cool
thing that I like about a lot of these
boards is m dot to everywhere like look
at look at that big long and that's like
what is that eighty that's m dot two
eighty eighty twenty two eighty twenty
to 110 I forget what the longest one is
there but that's really long this is
again another asrock oh this is the fat
this is the fatality motherboard shout
out to Jonathan fatality Windell and
then of course you'll notice a lot of
the same design elements that you might
be familiar with existing motherboards
you know chipset be Ram there's all that
good stuff but USB 3.1 gen2 support is
very nice to have as well and here's the
X 370 professional gaming which is also
part of the asrock fatality line black
and red aesthetic overall this one looks
like it's got a bit beefier heatsinks on
there and just just - just so you guys
know still using the same 24 pin main
motherboard power connector they're not
changing that thank god hey look it's a
gigabyte a m4 motherboard you know it
was funny it was when we went to
gigabyte at the beginning of the week
they said they had no idea anything
about a m4 gigabyte motherboards but
apparently they were liars but I forgive
them because they sponsored my CES 2017
coverage everyone go click on the
gigabyte link in the video's description
alright this is the what is this called
the GA a be 350 gaming 3 I'm gonna
shorten that to be 350 gaming 3 just to
be more simple so gaming 3 means this
would be a little bit more on the budget
side be 350 would mean that you would
still have overclocking support though
so that's pretty cool and then it looks
like they're continuing the trend of
having LEDs everywhere there looks like
there's an LED strip up the right side
of the board some other design elements
like there is an MDOT 2 in there you got
your MDOT - and then I don't know I
can't think of anything else else
compelling to say about this board
there's lots of other words to talk
about this let's continue on here's
another a320 board the a320 MHD - this
one's in a micro ATX form factor so
again you're not going to be able to
overclock with this one the lower end
chipsets provide functionality for like
windows secure boot and then the higher
end chipsets like be 350 and 370 X
provide additional
activity so you'll get additional USB
additional SATA support sometimes SATA
Express or thank God you can take SATA
Express and just use it as multiple
purpose PCI Express gen3 connections
here's an horas board got some white
shrouds there on the chipset heatsink as
well as the i/o and whatnot
we again LEDs get the LED strips going
up there but looks like some pretty
high-end features on this one USB 3
front panel headers I don't see the USB
3.1 front panel connector on there but I
don't think gigabyte has integrated
integrated that on to many boards this
does have like an LED post indicator and
the steel guard on some of the PCI
Express slots cool looking board though
overall and then I think this one is is
the nicest looking one in my personal
opinion this is also an X 370 board this
is also from the Auris line from
gigabyte so it's going to be a
higher-end x3 somebody gaming k5 on this
one I like the all blacked out look I
imagine this has RGB LEDs although um
detailed specs on these boards really
aren't aren't existing yet we're just
kind of looking at what we can see
what's available and what's been
confirmed by AMD as far as what the
chips the chipsets are capable of but
since the chipsets are capable lots of
different things and can be implemented
in different ways basically the
motherboard manufacturers have a lot of
different options they can sort of
integrate the different features however
they want and give you you know the best
board for whatever purpose they're
building for price point or that kind of
thing here's an a320 a321 looks a little
bit smaller maybe again a little bit
more in the budget side only to DIMM
slots another thing you might notice
convenient leaf conveniently so from
this month MSI motherboard that has
fallen off of its spot is that a lot of
these have video outs now it has also
been confirmed that the Rison ship will
not have an integrated GPU but there are
ap use that are compatible with FM 4
that will be slotting into this and I am
told that there will be seventh gen ap
use the ones that exist right
that will be reconfigured to slot into
AM 4 and then later in the year we'll
actually get the Zen based ap use and
those are going to come out for desktops
as well as for laptops because that's
really gonna be the push on the laptop
side is the AP use with the integrated
graphics and I'm sure there's gonna be
lots of exciting stuff about that but
we're probably not gonna hear about that
till the second half of 2015
anyway this is a be 350 tomahawk I
actually showed this a little bit in my
video covering MSI so check that up for
a little bit better view of that one and
then here's a beefy 350 M mortar again
one of the board's that we saw over at
the MSI booth and then finally the X 370
X power gaming titanium just just
looking looking real pretty there I
think it looks pretty you know what else
is pretty friends having a conversation
it's like Scott Kyle back there which I
can't seem to focus on there now before
I leave you guys I wanted to show you a
quick montage of really awesome system
builds that's something that I really
enjoy doing at trade shows because you
get really cool systems that you don't
often see in there you know they lit up
and all that good stuff so one of the
things that AMD has done with ricin is
they wanted to show off just how
enthusiastic a lot of the system
integrators are whether they're big
system integrators or small system
integrators they all want to build some
rice and systems for you guys so the
wall back there has a complete line of
system integrators a lot of small ones
too which I thought was pretty cool some
boutique boutique builders who have
built ready to go rise in systems that
you can just purchase straight up if you
don't wanna build your own so here's a
quick look at those but of course thank
you guys so much for watching my
coverage of CES 2017 I really appreciate
it I've had a great time this week
thanks to anyone who has come up and
said hello there bring quite a few
people who have introduced themselves
you're all awesome and super friendly
and you're great also big thanks to Kyle
working the camera back there we've been
turning around and he's been doing a
great job
shout out to my editor as well Joe
you're doing a great job Joe thanks for
editing all of my videos for this week
that's all for my coverage of CES 2017
though big thanks again to my sponsors
gigabyte deep cool as well as ocz and
thanks for watching guys big thumbs up
on the video down below comments and let
me know what you think about these
new rising boards as well as all of the
teases about Vega which were super super
excited about and here's some epic
system builds to end my CES coverage
2017 we'll see you again soon
here we go
and they just keep it rolling</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
