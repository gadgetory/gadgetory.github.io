hardware today's video is a quick
tutorial on the humble sli bridge that
is right and how to do a quick and easy
modification to it to make it look much
prettier purely for aesthetic purposes
this is one of the things I've learned
how to do or kind of retards I've been
working on the Arctic Panther this is
not however the final Arctic Panther
bila blog I have been working on that it
has been coming along and i will give
you guys a quick little update on that
towards the end of this video but for
now how did I go from this to this how
can you do that too what do you need to
do that and does this apply to crossfire
bridges as well yes yes it does although
those are less relevant now that's
Hawaii and Fiji based GPS don't need
them but I digress on to the tutorial so
many computers especially those with a
side panel window the SLI bridge is just
in a very visible position and we've
seen lots of systems built that don't
seem to do the best job when it comes to
actually well keeping them visually
appealing they stand out a lot
especially if you have one of these
older or cheaper SLI bridges like this
one they don't really do much when it
comes to aesthetic considerations there
are other SLI bridges available of
course like this one from ROG with the
ROG logo on it that is black and much
more appealing or here's another one for
each from EVGA for example that has the
nvidia sli logo these will work but what
if you're like me and I actually don't
have any rog hardware in this system I'd
have an asus motherboard but i also
don't have any EVGA hardware in this
particular system so i felt like those
wouldn't really work out so what I did
was I took an old ribbon style sli
bridge just like this one and I painted
it and now it looks like this and I
think that looks much better now I did
this sort of quickly and without much
research or consideration so thankfully
for this video I have done that but i
will say right from the get-go that this
sli bridge works I've tested it and that
is actually the second thing you should
do after getting all of your equipment
together is you should test your SLI
bridges or your SLI bridge to make sure
it works but let's talk about equipment
you might need other than the SLI bridge
you need paint and this is the paint
that I used originally this is an all /
this paint it works on metal wood
plastic and more I liked this paint
because it's matte black and I like the
matte black finish I didn't want my sli
bridge to be like too blingy and
standout ish I feel like if something's
in my system and I want it to stand out
it needs to blend in perfectly or like
warrant standing out so for that reason
I was just looking for more of a subtle
approach to the SLI bridge and that's
why I went with matte black but this is
the paint I actually about to paint some
of the my wires and some of the other
stuff in the system and the main concern
with the paint you choose is whether or
not it's conductive and lots of paint
can be conductive how conductive it is
depends on what the actual materials or
the chemicals are that are in the paint
and then also can depend on whether it's
wet or not so definitely if you are
painting at all make sure that you let
everything dry completely before you do
any testing the paint I will recommend
that you use if you're going to do this
project at home is going to be plasti
dip because plasti dip is it has it's
completely non Kentucky conductive it's
more like a plastic coating and you can
also peel it off so you just grew up you
can maybe start over that sort of thing
so today I'm going to be using this to
do a paint job on this SLI bridge here
here is the SLI bridge i did with a
matte black finish i think it turned out
very pretty but the concern here again
when it comes to the conductivity as
these terminals and there's actually
some voltage running through there so
that's why conductivity would be bad if
you were to bridge connections up here
you could potentially damage your well
your graphics card and other things so
that's why when I was testing this one
at least I didn't do with mine and ATT
is for example I use 9 60s but but you
you should just test beforehand or maybe
just use plastidip that's probably the
best bet plastidip you shouldn't be
concerned about the other things to
worry about when it comes to step 3
which we're going to do here in just a
second which is masking is you might
notice some very very small connector
connectors right in there in between the
plug and the thing and I would I would
avoid if you could getting paint clogged
up in that because that would be bad so
step 3 is masking sorry I didn't mention
in the equipment that you need some some
painters tapes and masking tape that is
important here's all I really did to
mask it off I use two small pieces
to cover the actual plugs on the end
because we don't want to get any paint
up in there that might be blocking the
connection between the plug and the
graphics cards SLI fingers other than
that have left everything as is and
again there is a gap in between here and
if you're not using Plasti Dip if you're
using anything that might be conductive
be really careful about getting paint
clogged up under there if you're using
the plasti dip even if plastic gets in
there that it should still be fine as
far as a connection goes so no worries
there let's move on to the next stage
though which is which is painting here's
my set up outside I have a bit of
cardboard to paint on use more than this
if you're at all concerned about the
surface you're painting on other that I
got shake the can up and then i'm going
to start painting i'm going to start
painting off to the side and then I'm
going to do I'm going to swipe across
all I'll start over here and then swipe
across the thing and then I'll start
over here and come back and I got to
turn it around the other way and do it
on the other side as well and then after
its dried a bit I'll flip it and do the
same thing from the other side
okay so this was a single coat I've
given it plenty of time to dry now well
it's only been about 10 or 15 minutes
but plasti-dip dries pretty quickly and
it's looking pretty good actually I'm
I'm happy with this else i got this camo
version of plasti dip which I wasn't
sure what it meant it was but I think it
means it's a little bit more matte of a
finish so here's the plasti-dip one on
the Left versus one ended with the other
paints on the right both looking pretty
nice let me just peel off the masking
here and we'll take a closer look at it
there's a downside of the plasti dip is
it all wants to come off in one piece so
I'm going to be a little bit more
careful removing the other side I worked
a little bit better alright so there's
your close-up look at the finished least
outside you can barely see some of the
like Asus labeling that was on there and
stuff before doesn't that it's pretty
much all covered maybe a little bit of a
Miss spot under here I could do another
coat on this but I want to keep it as
thin as as possible and I think this
will do just fine also not too much
buildup on the connection points right
up in there either so I'm happy with
that a couple final points to make on
the SLI bridge side one is going to be
that these are flexible you might notice
unless you're using a rigid PCB one
which you could probably do the same
thing with I imagined but if using a
flexible one that's another reason why
the plastidip might be a good choice
because it is flexible if you're using
other paint that you've deemed to be non
conductive maybe consider choosing one
that is the exact correct size for the
spacing of your graphics cards that's
kind of what I've done here just because
I don't want it I don't want it bulging
out either i don't like that look I just
wanted to direct three slot spacer which
are actually pretty common so just get
that if if you're worried about because
it flexing flexing the SLI bridge after
its painting could cause the paint to
crack or that kind of thing but that's
pretty much all for the SLI bridge part
of this but I'm promised you guys
another quick look at my ongoing custom
article build here so there it is in its
current state you'll notice i put my
custom sleeved power supply in there
I've started getting the cables router
round I'm working on training the cables
I had bought some cable combs they were
too small to fit through so I'm just got
them sort of lined up and held in place
with some twist ties for now and I gotta
see if that's going to work if they'll
stay as is after they've been trained
that way for a while or if i need to
actually get some other combs or
something that the 24-pin still needs
some work up there too but this come
along other than that I've got a most of
the hardware reinstalled in the system
I've got the rate radiators in place so
everything's coming back together I just
I do need to do some rebinding of the
tubes I think I'm actually only going to
be reusing one of the tubes that I've
bent from the original one the one that
goes from here up to here everything
else is spacing is a little bit
different because i'm using different
fittings and with all black fittings but
you know what i need to do is finish
this frickin build so i'm going to get i
think i'm i'm going to wrap this video
up and get to work on that there's a
look at the ongoing progress for Arctic
Panthers stay tuned for that final build
blog coming very very soon probably next
week sometime fingers crossed in the
meantime I hope you have enjoyed my
quick tutorial on how to create your
very own custom painted SLI bridge if
you enjoy these types of videos let me
know by posting a comment down in the
comments or maybe hit the like button to
let me know that you enjoyed it and
maybe you got something out of it also
don't forget to share this with your
friends so you think might be interested
if you stop by my store at store Paul's
cardboard net and you can buy a fancy
shirt not the shirt but church just like
it i have a new series that are out
right now or should be up this weekend
