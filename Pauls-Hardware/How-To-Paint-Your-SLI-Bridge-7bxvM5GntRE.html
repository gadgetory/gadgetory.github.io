today's video is a quick tutorial on the
humble sli bridge that is rates and how
to do a quick and easy modification to
it to make it look much prettier purely
for aesthetic purposes this is one of
the things I've learned how to do or
kind of retaught myself as I've been
working on the arctic panther this is
not however the final Arctic Panther
build blog I have been working on that
and it has been coming along and I will
give you guys a quick little update on
that towards the end of this video but
for now how did I go from this to this
how can you do that - what do you need
to do that and does this apply to
crossfire bridges as well yes yes it
does although those are less relevant
now that Hawaii and Fiji based GPUs
don't need them but I digress onto the
tutorial so many computers especially
those with a side panel window the sli
bridge is just in a very visible
position and we've seen lots of systems
built that don't seem to do the best job
when it comes to actually well keeping
them visually appealing they stand out a
lot especially if you have one of these
older or cheaper SLI bridges like this
one they don't really do much when it
comes to aesthetic considerations there
are other sli bridges available of
course like this one from ROG with the
ROG logo on it so that is black and much
more appealing or here's another one for
eat from EVGA for example that has the
nvidia sli logo these will work but what
if you're like me and I actually don't
have any ROG hardware in this system I'd
have an asus motherboard but I also
don't have any EVGA hardware in this
particular system so I felt like those
wouldn't really work out so what I did
was I took an old ribbon style sli
bridge just like this one and I painted
it and now it looks like this and I
think that looks much better now I did
this sort of quickly and without much
research or consideration so thankfully
for this video I have done that
but I will say right from the get-go
that this sli bridge works I've tested
it and that is actually the second thing
you should do after getting all of your
equipment together is you should test
your SLI bridges or your SLI bridge to
make sure it works well let's talk about
equipment you might need other than the
sli bridge you need paint and this is
the paint that I used originally this is
an all
piss paint it works on metal wood
plastic and more I liked this paint cuz
it's matte black and I like the matte
black finish
I didn't want my SLI bridge to be like
too blingy and stand out ish I feel like
if something's in my system and I want
it to stand out it needs to blend in
perfectly
or like warrant standing out so for that
reason I was just looking for more of a
subtle approach to the sli bridge and
that's why I went matte black but this
is the paint I actually about to paint
some of the my wires and some of the
other stuff in the system and the main
concern with the paint you choose is
whether or not it's conductive and lots
of paint can be conductive how
conductivities depends on what the
actual materials are the chemicals are
that are in the paint and then also can
depend on whether it's wet or not so
definitely if you are painting at all
make sure that you let everything dry
completely before you do any testing the
paint I will recommend that you use if
you're going to do this project at home
is going to be plasti dip because Plasti
Dip is it has its completely non
kentucky conductive it's more like a
plastic coating and you can also peel it
off so you should screw up you can maybe
start over that sort of thing so today
I'm gonna be using this to do a paint
job on this SLI bridge here here is the
SLI bridge I did with a matte black
finish I think it turned out very pretty
but the concern here again when it comes
to the conductivity is these terminals
and there's actually some voltage
running through there so that's why
conductivity would be bad if you were to
bridge connections up here you could
potentially damage your well your
graphics card and other things so that's
why when I was testing this one at least
I didn't do it with mine and ATT is for
example I use nine sixties but did you
you should just test beforehand or maybe
just use plastidip that's probably the
best bet plastidip you shouldn't be
concerned about the other things to
worry about when it comes to step three
which we're going to do here in just a
second which is masking is you might
notice some very very small connector
connectors right in there in between the
plug and the thing and I would I would
avoid if you could getting paint clogged
up in that because that would be bad so
step three is masking sorry I didn't
mention in the equipment that you need
some some painters tape some masking
tape that is important here's all I
really did to mask it off I use two
small pieces
to cover the actual plugs on the end
because we don't want to get any paints
up in there that might be blocking the
connection between the plug and the
graphics cards SLI fingers other than
that I've left everything as is and
again there is a gap in between here and
if you're not using Plasti Dip if you're
using anything that might be conductive
be really careful about getting paints
clogged up under there if you're using
the Plasti Dip
even if plastic gets in there it should
still be fine as far as the connection
goes so no worries there let's move on
to the next stage though which is which
is painting here's my setup outside I
have a bit of cardboard to paint on use
more than this if you're at all
concerned about the surface you're
painting on whether that I got to shake
the can up and then I'm going to start
painting I'm gonna start painting off to
the side and then I'm gonna do I'm gonna
swipe across I'll start over here and
then swipe across the thing and I'll
start over here and come back and I
gotta turn it around the other way and
do it on the other side as well
and then after it's dried a bit I'll
flip it and do the same thing from the
other side
okay so this was a single coat I've
given it plenty of time to dry now well
it's only been about 10 or 15 minutes
but plastidip dries pretty quickly and
it's looking pretty good actually I'm
I'm happy with this else I got this camo
version of Plasti Dip which I wasn't
sure what it meant it was but I think it
means it's a little bit more matte of a
finish so here's the Plasti Dip one on
the Left versus one I did with the other
paints on the right both looking pretty
nice
let me just peel off the masking here
and we'll take a closer look at it
there's a downside to the Plasti Dip is
it all wants to come off in one piece so
I'm gonna be a little bit more careful
removing the other side I worked a
little bit better alright so there's
your close-up look at the finished at
least outside you can barely see some of
the like ASIS labeling that was on there
and stuff before but other than that
it's pretty much all covered maybe a
little bit of a Miss spot under here I
could do another coat on this but I want
to keep it as thin as as possible and I
think this will do just fine also not
too much buildup on the connection
points right up in there either so I'm
happy with that
a couple final points to make on the sli
bridge side one is gonna be that these
are flexible
you might notice unless you're using a
rigid PCB one which you could probably
do the same thing with I imagine but if
using a flexible one that's another
reason why the plastidip might be a good
choice because it is flexible if you're
using other paint that you've deemed to
be non conductive maybe consider
choosing one that is the exact correct
size for the spacing of your graphics
cards that's kind of what I've done here
just because I don't want it I don't
want it bulging out either I don't like
that look I just wanted to direct three
slot spacer which are actually pretty
common so just get that if if you're
worried about because it flexing flexing
the SLI bridge after it's painting could
cause the paint to crack or that kind of
thing but that's pretty much all for the
SLI bridge part of this but I'm I
promise you guys another quick look at
my ongoing custom article build here so
there it is in its current state you'll
notice I've put my custom sleeved power
supply in there I've started getting the
cables routed around I'm working on
training the cables I had bought some
cable combs they were too small to fit
through so I'm just got them sort of
lined up and held in place with some
twist ties for now and I got to see if
that's going to work if they'll stay as
is after they've been trained that way
for a while or if I need to actually get
some other combs or something that the
24-pin still needs some work up there
too but it's coming along other than
that I've got a most of the hardware
reinstalled in the system I've got the
radiators in place so everything's
coming back together I just I do need to
do some rebinding of the tubes I think
I'm actually only going to be reusing
one of the tubes that I've bent from the
original one the one that goes from here
up to here everything else the spacing
is a little bit different because I'm
using different fittings and with all
black fittings but you know what I need
to do is finish this freaking build so
I'm gonna get I think I'm I'm gonna wrap
this video up and get to work on that
there's a look at the ongoing progress
for RP Panthers stay tuned for that
final build vlog coming very very soon
probably next week sometime fingers
crossed

maybe you got something out of it also
don't forget to share this with your
