the video description
it's not even all the all components
well hello everyone and welcome to
today's build video this is the largest
and most expansive build I have ever
attempted the goal today is to give you
guys a first look and an introduction to
the new Corsair obsidian 1000d case
which you might be able to see sitting
at the back behind all of this
incredible hardware that I'm going to be
putting together this build is gonna be
called Riptide
it's a thread Ripper based build and
there's actually gonna be two systems
involved the first system is threader
for 1950 X base that's going to be for
video editing as well as gaming with two
gtx 1080p eyes and then the second
system is going to be a FreeNAS build
and that's gonna be based on an AMD
Rison 520 400 g apu so i get the
thousand d out and go for that in just a
moment but real quick let's go over the
rest of the components for this build
and in case you didn't notice by the way
this build is sponsored and supported by
corsair and Asus so you're gonna notice
a lot of Corsair and Asus components
starting with the ROG Strix GTX 10 ATT
is a pair of those I've already worked
with them before they're really really
solid graphics cards very high-end gonna
start with the air-cooled and maybe
eventually water-cooled 'm for the
motherboard we got the RG zenith extreme
x 399 the highest end asus rog
motherboard this board is an absolute
beast it's completely feature pack so a
perfect central home for this system for
storage I have a collection of SSD
starting with the nx500 the new corsair
nvme this is a 400 gig drive so that's
going to be a boot drive for the main
system there's also an MP 500 nvme SSD
this is a 960 gig drive so this is going
to be a functional drive for video
editing and then I got a couple for Cle
SATA drives I'm gonna be using one of
these as a boot drive for the FreeNAS
build and then the other one will be
additional storage in the main build
here's the main CPU of course the rise
in thread ripper in 1950 X which is
currently out of its box the box is
really just there for show but then of
course on top of that we have the 2400 G
shows this actually based on a
recommendation from Windell because they
can be under clocked and under voltage
to run it very very
power draw and also are compatible if
you have the right motherboard with ECC
memory and ACC memory is very good to
have for a FreeNAS build I don't
actually have my ECC memory yet but I do
have this kit for the main build this is
the Vengeance RGB set 128 gigs yeah this
is the most memory I've ever put in a
single system or on a single motherboard
8 by 16 gig 32 hundred megahertz kit and
RGB lighting too so everything you could
want in system memory I sure hope it
plays nice with Red River the secondary
system will be on a completely brand-new
motherboard from Asus just launched this
is the x4 70 - I gaming from there ROG
Strix line this is probably a little
overkill for - build but again I wanted
something that would support the horizon
520 400 G processor and also have some
expandability and of course that
ever-important ECC support this also has
like 2 m2 slots and some other cool
features like that so we'll get that out
of the box in just a sec for power over
here we've got the corsair 8 X 1600 I
which is 80 plus titanium rated 1600
watt power supply so plenty of power
actually overkill actually I could even
potentially run both systems off of this
power supply but there will be an SFX
power supply that hasn't arrived yet for
the smaller system since the case does
support both of those now I got a crazy
amount of RGB LEDs going on in this case
it is corsair sponsored so so there's
some p5 of their commander Pro it's an
RGB lighting and fan controller combo so
hopefully I can connect up all of the
fans since this case supports something
like 24 fans they set me a couple sets
these are the ll series of fans so it's
got really cool RGB lighting effects I
have a bunch of 120 millimeter fans they
did send me a set of a hundred and forty
millimeter fans there as well so I have
plenty of options when it comes to
outfitting this case with fans and this
case supports lots of fans and finally
if there wasn't enough RGB LEDs in the
fans we've also got a couple RGB LED
lighting expansion kits here from first
there so I'm not exactly sure what's
involved there but it is additional RGB
LED strips so also works with the node
pro and commander Pro so these should
help to cast colorful lighting on areas
of the cases that aren't reached by the
fans I think it's important to set some
goals for today so the main thing is
going to be to get
everything unboxed and then to get the
main components into the system so I can
figure stuff out for the upcoming custom
water cooling loop also I need to figure
out cooling for the processor so that
should be fun too
for now though I'm just going to get
everything out of the box alright guys
here's a first look at the case now that
it's out of the box the box was very
large this is a very large case this is
one of the biggest builds I've ever done
but fortunately it wasn't that
challenging to get out you got to slide
the top of the box off kind of like you
would when you get like a new TV the
side panels actually comes separate so
there's no side panels on it when you
take it out of the box although the
front tempered glass panel is
pre-installed right there and then of
course there's another tempered glass
panel that goes on this side and then
one on the flip side on the back too
there is also a tempered glass piece
that goes along the top of the case I
have not peeled the protective plastic
off of that yet but that's all the
tempered glass you get here at the back
of the case you might notice extra power
and reset buttons specifically for the
mini ITX build because you can of course
fits two systems inside this case now
the first system is going to go right
here in a pretty traditional orientation
vertical it can support up to a ATX and
Beyond motherboard sizes since there's
plenty of space this entire top area
here is mainly made for like radiators
or reservoirs or whatever you want to
put up there and the mini ITX build
would go down here at the bottom so the
i/o for that would be here facing at the
back and these are the knockouts for
your graphics card or expansion slots if
you need them down there here's a look
at front panel IO power resets for ya
USB 3.0 ports you got a couple USB
type-c ports right here and these are
USB 3.1 gen2 so they do use the new
connector internally and then you've got
a mic and headphone jack as well
so guys I've got everything out of the
case and went ahead and removed all of
the plastic you protective pieces on the
tempered glass just FYI I am aware that
you should usually wait until you've
finished the build to take all those
plastic pieces off I'm gonna try to use
my nitrile gloves to keep from getting
fingerprints and smudges on the case for
the rest of the build but a couple
things I wanted to mention about this
case first is gonna be the price it's
$500 MSRP five zero zero so so I
hesitate to say five hundred dollars is
a good price it is obviously very
expensive it's a lot more than people
typically spend on a case but given that
this can actually handle two systems and
it is fairly unique in a bit of a
flagship item from Corsair remember the
900 D was Corsairs first case ever that
they launched and that was a full tower
case and that did very well for quite
some time but if you guys come away from
this video with a key piece of
information it would be that this case
does not ship with any fans so that I
think is kind of the price trade-off
that we're dealing with here more
practically speaking this can of course
support like up to 20 fans maybe even
more than that depending on how you're
configuring your radiators and
everything but course there's reasoning
for that decision is just that if you're
building a really high-end PC and your
custom arranging it that you might want
to choose your own fans now that might
mean that you choose Corsair ll series
fans like I have chosen today or it
might mean you have some other favorite
type of fan that you want to integrate
here so that's either a cool thing that
courser didn't bother to choose your
fans for you or a not cool thing because
fans are expensive and outfitting this
with a whole group of fans like 20 would
significantly add to the base cost of
the system all that said though let's
round out the features by pointing out
just a few more of them Corsair points
out this is a three chamber design for
this system one of
Chambers is a power supply chamber for
the main power supply down here at the
bottom can support up to a 220
millimeter length PSU so it's pretty
decent-size just about any high in power
supply should fit in there the second
chamber would be this main chamber I
suppose and here's where your
motherboard go both systems actually in
this chamber so whether you've got a
standard sized motherboard or EI TX or
this also supports like Server sized
motherboards like SSI CEB and that kind
of thing plenty of cable routing holes
and then they've also included some
polls up there at the top so you can
route stuff back behind the motherboard
tray on the other side of the case over
here there's doesn't seem to be a lot of
cable management space that's because
Corsair in order to keep things looking
clean since there is tempered glass on
this side panel as well they basically
have hidden away the cable management
area it's behind these doors so these
are just held on by magnets just like
the main side panels and you can swing
them open to give yourself a look at the
actual cable management zone so for
cable management you get about three
inches of space between the motherboard
tray and these doors that swing out so
maybe two and three-quarters inches
plenty of space though here you can also
see the pass throughs for those cable
grommets and then we also have mounts
they actually have four mounts here and
four mounts here for SSDs or 2.5 inch
drives it looks like they've mounted
three actual drive mounts on either of
these I haven't checked the accessories
to see if you get additional ones of
those and just checking our accessory
package it doesn't look like you get
additional 2.5 inch drive trays so bear
in mind if you want to go beyond 6 you
might need to get some additional drive
trays from Corsair you do get some
removable plastic drive trays here for
your 3.5 inch drives and the case
supports up to 5 3.5 inch drives which
is actually one fewer than I need
I was hoping for six figure it out there
and then the last thing you might notice
here is the commander Pro this is an
obsidian 1000d version of the commander
pro but it does appear to otherwise be
the same except for that text that says
obsidian 1000d this gives you a bunch of
extra connection points for fans as well
as LED strips and then you also get some
temperature connection points there so
you can put some temp sensors and then
those extra USB connection points that
allow you to daisy chain these together
so
can connect lots and lots of fans RGB
strips and temperature readout points
which is good because I have I have an
extra five of these I feel like that's
too many but I'll see how many I
actually need in order to get all my
fans connected up this is also what
makes this case a smart case because if
you connect up your commander Pro to
your operating system via USB you can
use it to monitor your fan speeds
temperatures and then have the court
share link utility automatically control
those to keep everything cool and quiet
in your system and here's a quick look
at the included accessories in the
Obsidian 1000 D you get some fan
extensions since you might be needing to
place fans in a position that is further
away from your motherboard than a
typical case this is a SATA adapter for
providing power to the commander Pro
this is an extension for that adapter
these are temperature sensors they've
included four of them so you can connect
these to your commander pro position
those in your case to get temporary
doubts I've got a bunch of baggies of
screws and standoffs fan mounts they are
separately bagged so I always appreciate
that finally a very decent stack here of
velcro straps some zip ties as well as
this bracket for your rear i/o and this
will allow you to rotate your graphics
card 90 degrees if you want them facing
up instead of sideways so guys there's
obviously more features to this case
than what I've shared with you already
but I don't think I'm gonna learn more
about it unless I actually build a
system in it so let's do that next here
goes
so you're on the back of the case
there's an extra panel it's got some hex
mesh built into it this is basically
like are you going to use the ITX mount
or nots if you're not you leave that on
there it covers the i/o for the mini ITX
it also covers up this space here which
is where an SFX power supply would go to
power your mini ITX build I'm still
waiting on the SFX power supply for this
build so I'm not going to get the mini
ITX system all up and set up today but
that's at least where it goes into the
power supply installed this shroud needs
to be removed in order to do that
there's only two thumb screws one at the
back and then there's one behind the
motherboard tray right there and then I
first I thought it was really hard to
get off but it was just stuck a little
bit so probably just since it's a newly
manufactured product and then that pops
out we can install our power supply
also this removable filter for a desk
for the power supply well guys the build
is proceeding it is getting later in the
day though and it's getting warmer here
so I have to kind of figure out where
we're gonna stop this phase of the build
and then plan stuff for the next phase
because part of the reason I'm getting
everything set up in here so I can get
measurements for cable extensions that
last mods it's gonna do for me and also
just got to figure out where all the
fans are gonna go cuz I got a bunch of
fans but not exactly the plan of where
everything should fit now one thing that
you may remember from when I first
covered this when it was called called
project slate at Computex
is these really cool like drawer system
before pulling out the mounts for your
radiators and fans at the top and front
of the case this will fit 340 millimeter
fans or a 420 millimeter radiator and
then up in front is where you can have
up to 8 120 millimeter fans or 360 or
480 millimeter radiators and you can
also do 480 millimeter radiators up at
the top here as well though I think you
need to swap this piece out these these
are roughly the same size but it's got
different mounts here so the tray in
between so you could swap this top one
with this one if you wanted to for right
now in order to get a system running or
at least half of the system running
because the FreeNAS build at the bottom
isn't going to be ready until the sfx
power supply arrives I am going to take
my single 360 millimeter radiator and
mount that to the front with some of the
ll series fans and I'm going to take
some more ll series fans just to sort of
flush things out give you guys a D an
idea of how it will look lit up across
the top and for an exhaust in the back
alright guys I'm exhausted I'm kind of
sweaty it's pretty warm in the garage
and this is the most involved in complex
build I think I've ever done for one
accommodating to systems in the same
case is a bit of a challenge and I'm not
even connecting them all the way up
right now the one thing I'm most
concerned about actually is access to
the power supply cage down here with the
second system set up definitely when we
go in here for the second try and we
start integrating the water cooling
stuff I'm gonna plug in pretty much all
of my modular power supply cables there
to make sure that if I ever need to plug
anything extra in that I don't have to
completely uproot this lower system in
order to get at that cage beyond that
though the LED implementation for this
build is pretty complex and I'm only
running with seven RGB LED fans now as
opposed to twenty I also wanted to point
out that I didn't fully populate the
Front's of the case with all of the fans
and that was pretty much because I
realized I was going to need to mount
this radiator up there I also need to
provide something else to go along with
part two I suppose but everything should
be at least functional we hope we pray
oh wow
I'm so happy now like like I was I was a
little concerned that if it didn't work
that I would have an aneurysm or
something like that but fortunately it
is alright guys that is pretty much
gonna do it for this video and I know
what maybe you're thinking you're
thinking Paul the bills not done that
that system on the bottom doesn't even
have a heat sink fan or like a power
supply and I would say yes you are
correct
and that's been my plan this whole time
I by no means was intended to finish
this build today I wanted to give a
first look at the 1000d since its brand
new from Corsair and the successor to
the 900 II after so long it's huge
there's tons of room to work with in
there not without its quirks but for 500
bucks I think people were looking for a
super high-end case that can fit two
systems in it I've been pretty impressed
with it so far now of course I will have
more to say after I finish this build
and I will be installing water cooling
stuff and actually using some of the
additional space in the top and the
fronts to do bigger radiators to
actually fill out all of those fans
across the front so that will look a lot
more uniform you kind of do need to fill
all eight of those fan slots in order
for it to look normal for now though
this is gonna have to do it I can't at
least get the main system set up and I
get windows loaded and maybe start
messing with the Corsair software as
well cos right now this is just the
default fan set up with just plugging it
in and turning it on also I need to
reorganize these fans and make sure
they're plugged in in the right order so
we can get the actual full on of course
they're lighting experiment going
because that's something that despite
the difficulty of setting it up once I
do get it set up I think it's gonna look
pretty cool but guys if you enjoyed this
video definitely hit the thumbs up I'll
put links to as much of this stuff as I
possibly can down in the video's
description so click on those if you
want to help me out and finally thank
you so much for watching hit the
thumbs-up button and we'll see you in
