Paul's hardware my youtube channel I am
Paul and this video is an introduction
to my channel it's also a bit of a
mission statement to set some clear
standards for how I run things around
here to explain how I make enough money
to do this full-time and more
importantly to make it clear what I
think is okay or not okay when it comes
to sponsorship and product placement in
YouTube videos my channel is about
computers computer hardware specifically
and how it performs and how different PC
parts can be put together to build a
computer for just about any use custom
pcs are often built for PC gaming of
course so I also like to test out
graphics cards to see how they perform
in games I do a live show every Tuesday
evening to talk about current technology
news and I also like to post time-lapse
videos reviews of course gameplay videos
build recommendations just about
anything else that I think would be
useful or entertaining for PC
enthusiasts out there I also try to
minimize the hype and keep things
relaxed in my videos because I don't
know about you guys but nothing gets me
less excited about a new product than
having some ad campaign screaming in my
face about how awesome and
groundbreaking it is I highly value
honest reviews particularly when it
comes to computer hardware that can cost
hundreds of dollars and if you happen to
find my channel to be a solid resource
for this type of information then I'm
doing my job right I'm constantly
grateful to be able to do what I do and
I never want to lose sight of the
humbling fact that its viewers like you
who make this possible my channel will
be nothing without your support whether
you provide it by simply viewing my
videos giving me constructive criticism
and feedback in the comments section or
of course clicking the ever-important
like button there have been quite a few
stories in the news recently about
youtubers who don't seem to feel this
way who instead view their subscribers
is a massive money-making pool of
eyeballs and impressionable minds that
they can exploit for profit I think this
is wrong and disrespectful to you so
here's my response I will never accept
money to review a product it's sad that
this needs to be stated since I always
accepted it as an industry standard but
I guess I do not only is taking money
for a review illegal it is reprehensible
I've never created a completely
sponsored video on my channel and I have
no current plans to do so if I ever do
you can be damn sure it's going to be
disclosed immediately and unambiguously
right up front at the beginning of the
video to be perfectly clear I make money
to support my channel and my family in
four different ways
one is YouTube ad revenue provided when
you guys watch the
video YouTube ads at the beginning of
the video I always do short skippable
ads and if you want to use an ad blocker
you are free to go ahead after all I've
definitely used them myself if you do
enjoy my videos though whitelisting my
channel or signing it for YouTube red
are great alternatives I also do
sponsored ad spots in videos these are
at the beginning of the video I try to
keep them short in the 15 to 30 second
range they are always labeled as sponsor
spots and ad and the product being
advertised are always separate and
unrelated to the videos actual content
third is the Amazon affiliate program
which also provides me with some income
basically if I talk about a product I
can provide a link to Amazon down in the
description to show you guys where to
buy it if you click that link it tells
Amazon that I sent you their way and
then I get a commission if you actually
place an order fourth and finally I have
my store over at store dot Paul's
hardware net where you can support me
about picking up some high-quality
paul's hardware merchandise like shirts
and hoodies mugs and PEG glasses and
that is all guys I've often referred to
myself as bad at business because
honestly there are many other ways that
I could try to cash in on this youtube
thing I could spam affiliate product
links on Twitter all day I could do
weekly deals videos which I'm not hating
on I just I just don't do them I could
line up more integrated ads for every
video and post them at the beginning and
the end of every video I could of course
accept money to make a specific video
saying specific things that a
manufacturer wants me to say about their
product without telling you guys I
accepted any money but I don't know
either I'm just contrary or I'm jaded
capitalism or I've just been called an
influencer too many times recently and
it kind of makes me feel a little dirty
but I don't like to do those things if I
influence you I want to influence your
level of knowledge to make it better so
you can make your own decisions about
how to spend your money I hope you guys
appreciate this approach because I have
no plans to change I am in debt to all
of you for the support and positivity
you've provided me since I started
YouTube and as always thank you very
much for watching my videos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
