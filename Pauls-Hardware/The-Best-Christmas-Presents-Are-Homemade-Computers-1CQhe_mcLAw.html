I apologize for going so long without an
update I know it's been a few weeks but
I wanted to give you guys a little
something for today and since it is
December and Christmas is upon us I
thought I would show you guys a great
gift idea this actually gift right
behind me then I'm going to be giving to
some of my nieces and nephews it's gonna
be their like kids computer for their
family so I thought I'd give you guys a
walkthrough of the build and what's in
there it's actually a lot of sort of
older hardware that I've sort of cobbled
together to make a working functional
computer that they can get some use out
of so without further ado let's take a
look now this computer is actually based
on an original phenom processor so the
Phenom won before they even had a name
after the word phenom 9500 which is a
quad-core and that was a old Tiki that I
had and I said this CP is still good in
fact it's it's quite good still
quad-core it can still run most stuff
and I really just wanted to look and
find the system to put it in so to start
off I needed a motherboard because I did
not have any am-2 or even two plus
motherboards around and to that end I
have that's that oh hey this was one of
my Black Friday deals one of the few
things I buy at Best Buy
flash drives so 10 bucks or I think 11
bucks
32 gig USB 2 flash drive anyway the
motherboard I found for this one is this
one right here this is the a 785 GM - LD
asrock motherboard a little it's
actually smaller than micro ATX and give
me just a moment to get the side panel
off we'll take a look inside we've had
an awesome mousepad okay anyone getting
distracted alright so I went ahead and
boot it up there you can see it's up and
running not necessarily be quiet to
build I've ever done there's actually
quite a few fans in this case the case
by the way since I didn't mention at the
beginning is a in win BR 665 they
migrated kicked case and when it's not a
little bit smaller a little bit more
portable but it's up and running as you
can see so there's the board the AE AE
785 GM - le as you can see it's actually
a little bit smaller than a typical
micro ATX board it's actually a little
bit not quite as wide that way so
fits in there nice it gives it a nice
tangy little build look I was able to
remove like the cages at ruff here at
the front so that gives a lot more space
some direct airflow because there is
there are two fans X with the front here
he says lots of stuff and unfortunately
all of them have to plug pretty much
straight into the power supply which is
why turning a little bit ladder s
thinking about getting a fan controller
might add that out in the future but
there's actually like a 120 right here
and then I think a taking eighty or
ninety two millimeter down there at the
bottom you under it into the hard drives
ah okay so cobbling together old
hardware first off we have two older
hard drives these are SATA hard drives
right there but I got out 160 gig and a
250 gig right there that's just so they
could separate at least have a little
bit of backup and separate the operating
system drive from the storage drive
power supply here this is my old power
supply that I ran in my system for quite
some time
enter max Maju 82 plus is one of the
their earlier 80 plus bronze modular
pirates flight great great power supply
love this power supply just needed more
wattage so I upgraded this one just been
sitting around collecting dust for a
while it's a 625 watt so you can see mod
really cables I did I'd I don't know I
didn't okay got a job with the cable
management here because there are some
there there's some space behind the
motherboard tray so so able to route a
bunch of the stuff back there this the
motherboard has look six serial ata
plus IDE another great thing is if
you're building a sort of a slightly out
of date system like this you can find a
nice home for some of your old IDE
optical drive so I got a Sony DVD burner
up those ID also this Zalman cooler
which gosh I can't remember the model of
right now maybe I'll throw it up there
and overlay the dama cool I really like
to school or because it's pretty quiet
much much much better job cooling than
the stock cooler of course stock and be
cooler and it's like 20 somewhere
between 20 to 25 bucks it's that copper
heat pipes just way better cooling way
quieter and yeah so I got that on there
oh also um fits on the stock brackets
for the am too
they're like any AMD CPU heatsink just
drops out on knife so no need for a
backplate that's also pretty nice the
gold pieces here is ocz I got a couple
two gig sticks and ddr2 memory that's
that's actually the hardest thing prefer
this type of build to find as the older
ddr2 memory but they got a total four
gigs there and then video card here just
a simple little 7750 Andy Radeon HD so
it's a newer video card but still you
know not super high-end again this is
this is a kids computer they're not
going to be playing battlefield 3
anything like that on it they can do
some gaming but that should keep them at
least running up with some newer like
DirectX 11 and everything and they'll be
able to play back movies and all that
one last thing actually that I haven't
added on right there you see the blue
cable that's a pass through a USB 3.0
pass through or the USB 3.0 on the front
of course this motherboard does not have
USB 3 so I'm actually this is right here
I've gotta add on USB 3.0 PCI card so
I'm going to drop that in and then I
will be writing that blue cable back
through so that they actually have USB 3
so they can actually transfer your stuff
pretty quick then another thing of
course maybe in the future might drop in
is an SSD for them so who knows maybe a
birthday present in the future something
like that that's pretty much your bill
you can see the it's just sort of like a
vomit of colors anything that's one
thing I like with newer hardware is that
you actually have uh have much better
color schemes this is like you get gold
you got yet blue EF is like red ports on
here these lime green it's actually kind
of funny the asrock lime green
motherboard manages to be just a
slightly different lime green than the
default like these little clips on the
case and everything by the way just to
comment on case certain plastic case
retention clips
I generally despise them these little
guys right here I almost never use them
they're never sturdy enough and I always
just end up going around them or just
snapping them off or something like that
so that I can actually bolt the PCI
Express cards in because it just makes
way more sense but anyway so there's a
look system they got a pretty decent
system up running here this should
a little while give their parents some
leeway to use their own computer which
they've had for a little while which is
a little bit nicer wonder this it's like
a Core 2 Duo 8400 or something along
those lines
but now the kids will have their own
computer too and that's all for this
video you guys I hope you've enjoyed
maybe a good idea for a last minute gift
idea if you guys have some old hardware
lying around what I did to fund this
computer was I hit up some of my other
family members who usually buy presents
for my nieces and nephews and I said hey
everyone chip in a little bit to buy
some of the parts that are needed other
parts that I have on hand we'll put it
all together we'll give them a computer
that way they can have a second computer
for their home because right now they're
running on just one I would love to hear
you guys feedback on this build on this
video on the channel on types of videos
you guys would like to see because I
will be I'm planning on that
contributing a lot more content to this
channel in 2013 when things cleared up a
little bit and add a little bit more
time I have Paul you're watching Paul's
hardware please subscribe if you want to
see more videos like this you can follow
me on Twitter it's at Paul Hardware with
no s and see you later guys have a Merry
Christmas and a Happy New Year
