I apologize for going so long without an
update i know it's been a few weeks but
i wanted to give you guys a little
something for today and since it is
december and christmas is upon us i
thought i would show you guys a great
gift idea this actually gift right
behind me then i'm going to be giving to
some of my nieces and nephews it's going
to be there like kids computer for their
family so i thought i'd give you guys a
walkthrough of the build and what's in
there it's actually a lot of sort of
older hardware that I've started cobbled
together to make a working functional
computer that they can get some use out
of so without further ado let's take a
look now this computer is actually based
on an original phenom processor so the
Phenom one before they even had a name
after the word phenom 9500 which is a
quad core and that was a ltq that i had
and i said this CP is still good in fact
it's quite good still quad-core it can
still run most stuff and I really just
wanted to look and find the system to
put it in so to start off I needed a
motherboard because I did not have any
am too or aim to plus motherboards
around and to that end I have it set oh
hey this was a one of my black friday
deals one of the few things i buy at
best buy flash drives so 10 bucks or i
think a lot of bucks 32 gig yes be to
flash drive anyway the motherboard i
found for this one is this one right
here this is the a 785 GM dash LD asrock
motherboard little it's actually smaller
than micro ATX and give me just a moment
to get the side panel off we'll take a
look inside move that an awesome
mousepad okay I'm getting distracted
alright so i went ahead and boot it up
there you can see it's up and running
not necessarily be quite a bill that
ever done there's actually quite a few
fans in this case the case by the way
and since i didn't mention that the
beginning is a in wind BR 665 they
migrate kicks case i want something
little bit smaller a little bit more
portable but what's up and running as
you can see so there's the board the
87-85 GM dash le as you can see it's
actually a little bit smaller than a
typical microatx board it's actually a
little bit not quite as wide that way so
fits in there nice it gives you the nice
tiny little build look I was able to
remove like the cages at rough here at
the press that gives a lot more space
some direct airflow because there is
there are two fans X with the frontier
he says lots of stuff and unfortunately
all of them have to plug pretty much
straight into the power supply which is
why turning a little bit latter s
thinking about getting a fan controller
might add that out in the future but
there's actually like a 120 right here
and then I think a thick an 80 or 90 2
millimeter down there at the bottom
going directly into the hard drives ah
ok so cobbling together old hardware
first off we have two older hard drives
these are SATA hard drives right there
but I got out 160 gig and a 250 gig
right there it's just so they could
separate at least have a little bit of
backup and separate the operating system
drive from the storage drive power
supply here this is my old power supply
that Iran in my system for quite some
time enter max maju 82 plus is one of
the there earlier 80 plus bronze module
a pirate's life great great power supply
love this price but I just needed more
wattage so I upgraded this one's just
been sitting around collecting dust for
a while it's a 625 wat so you can see
modular cables I did it I don't know I
didn't oki got a job with the cable
management here because there are some
there there's some space behind the
motherboard tray so so able to write a
bunch of the stuff back there this the
motherboard I look 6 serial ATA plus I
de another great thing is if you're
building a sort of a slightly out of
date system like this you can find a
nice home for some of your old ide
optical drive so i got a sony DVD burner
up this ID also this zalman cooler which
gosh i can't remember the model of right
now maybe i'll throw it up there and
overlay the dhamma cool i really like to
school or cuz it's pretty quiet much
much much better job cooling than the
stock cooler of course stock and be
cooler and it's like 20 somewhere
between 20 to 25 bucks it's got copper
heatpipes just way better cooling way
quieter and yeah so I got that on there
oh also um fits on the stock brackets
for the am too
they're like any AMD cpu heatsink just
drops out on there so no need for
backplate that's also pretty nice the
gold pieces here is ocz I got a couple
two gig sticks of ddr2 memory that's
that's actually the hardest thing prefer
this type of build to find it's an older
ddr2 memory but they got a total four
gigs egg and then video card here just a
simple little 7750 andy radeon HD so the
newer video carb is still you know not
super high-end again this is this is a
kids computer they're not going to be
playing battlefield 3 or anything like
that on it they can do some gaming but
that should keep them at least running
up with some newer like directx 11 and
everything and they'll be able to
playback movies and all that one last
thing actually that I haven't added on
are there you see the blue cable that's
a pass through a USB 3.0 pastor or the
USB 3.1 the front of course this
motherboard does not have USB 3 so I'm
actually this is right here I've gotta
add on USB 3.0 rd so I'm going to drop
that in and then I will be writing that
blue cable back through so that they
actually have USB 3 so they can actually
transfer stuff pretty quick then another
thing of course maybe in the future my
drop-in is an SSD for them so who knows
maybe your birthday present the future
something like that that's pretty much
the bill can see it's just sort of like
a vomit of colors that's one thing I
like with newer hardware is that you
actually have have much better color
schemes this is like you get gold you
got yet bluey as is like red ports on
here these lime green it's actually kind
of funny the asrock lime green
motherboard manages to be just a
slightly different lime green than the
default like these little clips of the
case and everything by the way just to
comment on K Street in plastic case your
tension clips I generally despised them
these little guys right here I almost
never use them they're never sturdy
enough and I always just end up going
around them or snapping them off or
something like that so that i can
actually bolt the pci express card then
because it just makes way more sense but
anyway so there's a look system they got
a pretty decent system up running here
this should
a little while give their parents some
leeway to use their own computer which
they've had for the LA which is a little
bit nicer one than this it's like a core
two duo e8400 or something some long
those lines but now the kids will have
their own computer too and that's all
for this video you guys I hope you've
enjoyed may be a good idea for a
last-minute gift idea if you guys have
some old hardware lying around what I
did to fund this computer was I hit up
some of my other family members who
usually buy presents for my nieces and
nephews and I said hey everyone chip in
a little bit to buy some of the parts
that are needed other parts that i have
on hand will put it all together will
give them a computer that way they can
have a second computer for their home
because right now they're running on
just one i would love to hear you guys
feedback on this build on this video on
the channel on types of videos you guys
would like to see because i will be i'm
planning on that contributing a lot more
content to this channel in 2013 when
things have cleared up a little bit mad
a little bit more time I appalled you're
watching Paula's hardware please
subscribe if you want to see more videos
like this you can follow me on Twitter
it's at hull hardware with no s and see
you later guys have a Merry Christmas
and a Happy New Year
now but anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
