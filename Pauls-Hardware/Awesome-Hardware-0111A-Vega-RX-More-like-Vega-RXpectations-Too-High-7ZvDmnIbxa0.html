so then I switch to Spanish yeah yeah
why am i espanol is so bueno muy muy
bien no it is is muy bueno super good oh
it's perfect
all right beautiful Filioque hello
everyone and welcome I'm assuming we
should be live both the twitch and
YouTube now so hi guys
welcome to awesome hardware this is a
live show we usually do it every Tuesday
evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
although today it's Wednesday because
yesterday was the 4th of July so now
it's July 5th this is episode 111 it's
our 11-day first episode I'm gonna try
to say that as many times as I can
throughout throughout the episode and
yeah we're gonna talk about some
technology we're gonna drink some beer
might have some adult language from time
to time so bear that in mind if you are
a youngster or whatever I don't
recommend this for young people unless
you're really smarter mature you don't
mind us cuz we only curse when it's
really when it's really important that's
true we Kristen with emphasis yeah it's
only two as an exclamation point on an
otherwise dull sentence we curse like
smart people yeah smart mature people
you're goddamn right poop okay alright
let's let's really quickly plug our
stores if you guys happen to buy this
thing during the show we will give you a
shout out at the end we try our best to
do that we almost always do my stories
pulsar Burnett I have some shirts in
men's and women's kits as well as some
decals and beanies and polo shirts and
nickels and Publicis of course the
lovely lovely pug glasses for drinking
things so check that out buy some stuff
if you had a buy stuff from Kyle it's
bit wit dot tech slash store and he's
also got some hoodies and some shirts
and he's also got some tall boy some
tall boy glasses and do all the glasses
a 20-ounce all the merchandise is super
high-quality
yep and if you buy from both of our
stores at the same time you'll get the
stuff shipped together and then after it
ships you will get a little bit of a
discount or a refund I should say and
your shipping usually get like I think
about five five or six bucks back most
people yeah it'll be automatically a
small small portion will be
automatically we're funded to you after
you make the purchase you won't see the
checkout but don't worry you'll get it
eventually yes indeed
before we dive into the show proper
cheers Cheers thanks that I guess being
here
yay I'm drinking moose drool by the way
which Kyle has provided me with them and
is a very tasty beer yep
I'm drinking a big sky IPA I believe
most rules from Idaho um I could be
wrong
uh Montana Montana I'm sorry it's closed
Sudan this is a big sky brewing damn so
I was on the trip that I drove I cuz I
actually got moose drill very close to
the brewery the first time I got it when
I was like this is like 12 years ago or
something I'm sorry I said Big Sky IPA I
meant was it pick me pick me but Big Sky
pick from big from Big Sky Brewing Lilla
also guys who are donating in chat thank
you very much we'll be reading all of
the messages that are attached to
donations at the end of each half of the
show so keep on giving us money all
right new segments which is really just
a grouping stories which I thought I'd
make a new segment for a new segment is
Las Vegas wait but it's not even seen
yes time of year it's actually it means
the Vegas right cuz his daughter gpus
right I thought that was clever enough
that I even made a new lower thirds for
it there it is Matt Amir bad Amir Putin
improves guys love this names you good
it's perfect uh so let's let's talk
about the first story in this list we
actually talked about Vega launch the
launch of Vega frontier edition mega Fe
last week which launched the day that we
did the show last week and they didn't
really do much sampling to vendors are
to reviewers prior to that so there
Vince very good reviews that have come
out I'm going to share a couple stories
from excuse me I went to the wrong story
first we're gonna talk to a couple
reviews from gamers Nexus as well as PC
perspective but first since all the
excitement about Vega is about the Vega
RX the Radeon version of Vega which is
meant for gaming since the frontier
edition has not been for gaming there
are some new leaks on that just just
recently this WC CF Tech so grain of
salt
salts can
according to them via a 3d mark 11
database entry because when you when you
do some of those benchmarks see
synthetic benchmarks they might
automatically lips impression ribbon
when you do benchmarks they might
automatically submits the benchmark to a
database and so you troll those
databases and look for specific IDs of
graphics cards that you know exist WCC F
Tech apparently discovered some of that
the the reference rx Vega board is
codenamed six eight seven f : c1 which
really rolls off the tongue that's just
a database entry though and they have it
kind of paired up here with the
different GPUs some that exist some that
are are cut our forthcoming clock speed
they'll 1630 megahertz though is what
was registered by this database entry
also featured eight gigs of HBM to not
sixteen like the like the frontier
addition and total 484 gigabytes per
second of bandwidth between the memory
and the GPU which is pretty impressive
but I mean the same as a frontier
Edition so it does represent 30
megahertz core clock faster speed than
the frontier Edition however the HBM to
memory is running at the same frequency
so so there's that now if this is just a
reference Edition which we would have to
assume it is since this until very early
and of course we're assuming this is
this is real baby then you know we would
also have to assume that there would be
aftermarket cards made by third party
board adding board manufacturers that
might move those clock speeds up or
perhaps even memory frequency that kind
of thing now since this is a benchmark
3d mark 11 benchmark they did have the
actual results listed here they're not
looking at the overall score in this
list they're just looking at the
graphics score because they're all
tested with slightly different hardware
although it looks like all these are
with 6700 case but the generic vga one
is over then left score 330 1873 which
is more than the gtx 1080 which scored
27,000 618 also more than the
gtx 1070 with the score of twenty three
thousand six hundred and eight although
still falls behind the ten ATT i try to
score of thirty eight thousand three
hundred and eighty nine so it looks like
it's almost right in between the 1080
and ten of ET i may be leaning a little
bit closer to the ten eighty but will
probably be a lot cheaper than the 1080i
there yeah i mean and that according to
these tests of course and these are
synthetics that's really early we would
assume that whatever bent whatever
drivers they're using are still
premature since the drivers even for the
the frontier edition they've already
stated that the the gaming side drivers
for that when it's in game mode are
still not you know as as totally good as
they should be
yeah because they're still working on it
probably a lot of that has to do with
the launch cadence that they've gone
with for Vega because they originally
promised Vega by the end of the first
half which was the end of June and they
barely squeaked it in there with the
frontier Edition getting it out like
just barely on the last couple days of
June and it wasn't even the gaming
version of car but hey they did launch
Vega they launched a big bigger products
crash the neighbors do they yeah
WCC up SEC to do the charts down here so
you can see those next to each other's
today's the Vega was the score thirty
one thousand 1080i up there were thirty
eight thousand ten eighty ten seventy
down there below it so there you go
they all sorry ran these tests with
their own cards and got some various
scores to test with some over clock
speeds and whatnot so the articles
linked in the video description as is
all the articles that we are talking
about today so you guys can check those
up a little bit more info on it I wonder
I wonder if Vegas launch price from the
RX Vegas launch price is gonna be
affected at all by the cryptocurrency
mining you know fuckery that's going on
right now I don't know it's difficult to
say because it's you know it's
impossible to say right I guess unless I
mean okay so the reviews that we're
gonna talk about right now of course
from gamers Nexus PC PC perspective have
been testing mostly a mix of gaming and
workstation applications to kind of see
what the cards are made of gamers Nexus
focused a lot on power consumption and
and that kind of thing because those are
that's that's a more fundamental thing
about the chip that isn't going to
change
much with with driver updates and they
also you know they're very methodical in
there and they're testing everything so
that's how they decided to go about it
but just to run down real quick again
linked in the description if you guys
want to read the full article this one's
by Steve Burke and he did a series of
tests they did the workstation test of
blender Maya 3d studio max creo kata
kata-kata kata-kata yeah and they also
did GP test our gaming performance
testing firestrike doom sniper Ghost
Recon for our honor and ashes of the
singularity than paranoid noise and
thermals at the end fascinating
fascinating stuff they've also done that
tear down of the card they had builds
I'd go over it and talk about the power
delivery modules on everything which are
all really really impressive been really
really well done he was he was very very
enthusiastic about kind of the ideal
layout they had Dennis far as the
spacing between the power phases and the
GPU which is you're only able to do
because you have the HBM which is also
on the same package with in with the GPU
die itself but anyway this GPU is a
weird situation because it is not a
gaming graphics card but it's not
necessarily a workstation a
fully-fledged workstation graphics card
anything other workstation graphics
cards like your quad rose and your fire
pros cost as much as they do because
they require a serious amount of
validation to make sure that they're
going to work with the software that
you're paying lots and lots of money for
the analogy that Steve made in his video
was if you're developing something like
you're developing parts for airplanes
it's very important that everything is
very very accurate because people's
lives are at stake if you're developing
a video game you know it's not quite as
important so you can get by with
something that's a little bit less
expensive and it doesn't necessarily
have all the validations so what you
have with Vega Frontier Edition is a
workstation class graphics card not
quite as many validations as you would
have with those types of GPUs but a
thousand bucks or 1500
once the particle version is available
and for people who are doing that type
of work it makes a lot of sense it's not
a gaming graphics card but a lot of
people are looking at as looking at it
as such and that's why a lot of the
gaming tests when you compare it i've
been seeming disappointed to people
again there's still work being done on
the drivers for these the gaming side
drivers we're not sure how much improved
performance to expect there once those
do become more fleshed out and more you
know actually tailor tailored for
specific titles and that kind of thing
but when it comes to the actual tests
the gamers Nexus ran at least the Vega
frontier Edition kind of traded blows
with the Titan XP and the workstation
tests that they ran maya 3d studio max
blender creo and kate Katya
katia like like and pronounce that wrong
it did seem to like CAD based tasks a
little bit better but again a little bit
pretty much went back and forth when it
came to the gaming tests it would
actually perform either just below a gtx
1080 or above a gtx 1070 in the actual
gaming performance as listed but again
this is not a gaming card so this is why
some people are looking at these tests
and being like wow like not being a big
into meeting a 1080 like that that seems
disappointed or whatever but it's not
what it's intended for really yeah so
again really good job on article by
gamers Nexus so it encourage you guys to
read that full on if you want to get a
little bit more info on its yeah Steve's
conclusion was that it's really an entry
to professional level card it makes
sense for workstation apps it's
inexpensive inexpensive versus a Quadro
or a full-fledged workstation GPU like
that it's a good fit for someone like
the game developer who needs to also be
able to switch over to gaming mode
quickly and not fully rely on
workstation level level drivers so yeah
there's that what's called your video
game developer yes it is and there's a
lot of video game developers
there it's a very you know it's a good
market to get into there's lots of jobs
and everything and there's lots of small
studios who need to do that kind of work
who can't afford to show up for $1,000
or $5,000 for a graphics card mm-hmm so
perhaps something nice to sit in between
there and and there's also really
nothing on Nvidia site that I know of
that sort of a hybrid between a
workstation and a gaming card is there
Titan XP that's pretty yeah I guess
there's an XP which is what it's
compared to and in most of their their
tests and the Titan XP is 1,200 bucks
the Vegas frontier edition is $1,000 the
Titan XP does seem to outperform it when
you look at sort of across the board as
far as testing goes the Vega frontier
Edition also seems to draw a little bit
more power
although the Vega Frontier editions
stock cooler seems to do a slightly
better job it's all it kind of depends
on much which tests are running and
everything though but the point being
it's it's it's competitive to a degree
with the Titan XP so there's probably
going to be people who are interested in
it right so yeah there's that further
from gamers Nexus because they actually
have a card and they're doing pretty
cool stuff with it
just today I didn't include it for
today's coverage but they did a clock
for clock comparison with the frontier
addition and the feejee the the theory
or Yuri the fairy x-3x is faster
surprising just kidding when they're
Clarke's pockets yeah when they're when
they're clock for clock it's it's weird
because sometimes they're kind of been
the same at the same level with each
other but um yeah it's so the drivers to
though that I mean the feejee drivers
have been yeah in development for quite
some time as opposed to just this really
fresh launch and it's not even for like
a die-hard gaming card like the jerk
seems like the drivers are maybe more
tuned or optimized for like the 3d CAD
you know rendering type stuff that would
seem like that's what they were more
ready for yeah or perhaps they're just
lets less scrutiny in that area than if
they had launched its specifically true
I'd like the gaming card or whatever
but yeah with the comparing it to the
fury X was interesting but I'm in
Baramulla fury act ships at a clock
speed of 1050 whereas this is shipping
at a clock speed of 1600 so yeah that's
a lot of benefit that you get just with
the improved architectures that they're
able to just run it at a much higher
frequency but there is there's some
interesting stories about that too and I
think they're also going into doing
another hybrid mod with it and water
cooling it
I also heard him mention anyway all
right let's talk about PC perspective
they've been doing the same thing
Ryan Strout actually was following him
and his tweets and everything and he was
one of the first to get his cards from
what I understand and last week
PC perspective actually did a live
stream with some initial benchmarks and
then their live stream charts he was
putting up and everything were
immediately screen capped and reposted
by WCC f Tech as well as elsewhere
around the internet which is either
either like shitty or hey cool more
exposure for PC perspective I guess I
didn't see anyone posting him without
attribution for the most part but yeah
Ryan actually ordered a couple cards to
make sure he could get them quickly he
got both of them so he has done some
crossfire testing this was just posted
today yeah caveats in the article again
these are not gaming cards the drivers
are not ready yet
we have that all in mind he said in both
game mode and professional motocross the
crossfire option is just there and it's
in the Radeon settings you just just
turned on so that's that's fairly easy I
suppose and then the results which are
down here and I mean they I'm not going
to go to each individual page here but
he did dirt rally fallout for grand
theft auto 5 hitman The Witcher 3 and
the results were pretty impressive
pretty much across the board Vega
frontier Edition and crossfire jumps up
so it's beating a 1080 but still not
beating a 1080 Ti so you can either look
at that as like good it improved or look
at it like man it still didn't beat
that's an ATT I not a gaming card yep
still not fully fleshed out drivers ok
especially for crossfire - well yeah
especially especially for crossfire also
pointed out in the article crossfire
bench or crossfire drivers support is
often like the very last thing that game
developers and/or the driver developers
actually focus on so all that stuff in
mind the exceptions in that and in the
case what I was talking about it also
lost to the 1080 in GTA 5 to 2560 by
1440 it had zero or a negative scaling
and hitman so that performance was
pretty much pretty pretty much the same
as a single card and it did manage to
beat the 1080i and witcher 3 at 4k so
they had pretty good scaling there and
and which were three good to know yeah
alright one last story here in this
segments since we've been talking so
much about Vega last Vega this has been
we've mentioned this before but it has
now been confirmed the RX Vega gaming
GPUs are going to be launched we don't
know what to agree that they're going to
be launched to what degree they're going
to be launched but they're gonna be
launched at SIGGRAPH 2017 they'll be
unveiled so again we're not sure if that
means that's when reviews are gonna come
out or go on sale sale or they're gonna
have like a paper launch or like a we
confirm this actually exists and here's
some specs for it and another month
we'll have them for you who knows
hopefully it means that there's actually
reviews and everything like that nothing
was confirmed today but we don't know
what it is yeah
the company's like let's go confirmation
can be it's very good I can confirm we
know nothing yeah the this confirmed via
the Radeon Twitter so SIGGRAPH 2017
which is in Los Angeles maybe we can
stop by July 30th to August 3rd is when
the event actually takes place SIGGRAPH
is the special interest group on
computer graphics and interactive
techniques this is their annual
conference on computer graphics
that's convenient by the ACM SIGGRAPH
organization the first SIGGRAPH
conference was in 1974 I don't like how
it's
the they left out two letters in their
analogy because it's and interactive
techniques so graphic I feel like
interaction graph it so graph it is a
graph it you're right I mean that's it
even flows my thinks might have been
added later on like you know and they
shoulda should have added on int I feel
like interactive techniques whatever
that means is getting left out of the
equation and you'll know that reason
notify that I will not be attending
cigarette here Kyle's putting cigarette
on blast right now I'm boycotting that
date the name sucks that they can't
learn acronyms they can't run a trade
show sorry
feel very strongly but okay don't we
gotta burning your bridges with like
respect to going there and checking big
ass I know I know you show up to Vic I'm
here for the Vega demo it's like you
were the money hey hey if I got if I got
if I got x-series samples from Intel
after that sketch video that's true
that's true maybe I should be got here
gotta keep pushing them
yep that's right never back down no okay
so uh Vega Vega for gaming should
hopefully be here soon yeah yeah alright
another new segment oh this this next
double trouble I know this new segment
is gone say it ain't so
like the Weezer song yeah cool like I
know that's a good song yes actually
when I came up with the name I didn't
even put those two and two together and
then it and then I was like oh yeah I
like that song this is true anyway these
are mostly stories about scams of some
degree or things that seemed to be one
way and then actually or not so that's
yeah that's this is probably a 1 this is
probably Wow
roughly not gonna do become a regular
segment on the show or anything like
that but you never know
alright so I think we talked about this
on the show before this is over over in
China IRS check era's Technica article
you remember this car straddling bus
what we mentioned we I'm pretty sure we
showed this at some point it's a bus
that drives over the top of a road
tracks on the side and the bus is on top
and then the traffic
and still go underneath that's pretty
cool yeah this was a first reported last
year in late August it's in the Chinese
city of Ching Wong Dao I'm not sure if
I'm pronouncing that correctly its new
Beijing and this is the TEB the transit
elevated bus but apparently it's all
garbage it's all BS what yep this has
all been photoshopped no so it actually
exists and it didn't roll up and down
the road a few times but has since have
just been abandoned and sits in the
middle of the street in December it had
been sitting on its test track in the
city for months gathering dust and
causing traffic jams that was I believe
reported on CNN what how is it causing
traffic jams if it allows cars to
underpass I don't know you can't it's
scary you know you just see this big
thing right what do you do just slam on
the brakes
oh no it's a tunnel that looks weird
yeah pretty much like what if you needed
to I like UFO what if you're like right
as I get under there I'm gonna need to
pull over for some reason and then it's
gonna be blocking blocking the way how
unlucky would you be possible you had to
really pull over it's that the span of
that that 20 feet can happen at the
worst time okay fair enough yeah so on
Sunday Beijing's Dongcheng District
Police Bureau announced on Weibo that it
had started an investigation to the
company behind the TEB project that's
why yang collat chyli fogging Kailasa
and trying to pronounce Chinese words
embed any way that company is sort of as
an online investing platform kind of
like crowd Cube never heard of crowd you
okay but it's an online investing
platform let's let's compare it to
something like Kickstarter sure except
it's it for investments the police say
they're holding more than 30 people and
it says holding is it did they arrest
them I'm not sure maybe that's why it's
not running it's just like that just
holding yeah this is holding maybe to
say no because sobbing what's stopping
anything very kind of them very nice but
does it includes by Zhi Zhi Ming who
runs the why young Kyle I and the TV
projects sorry yeah that's a Chinese
anyway this project was sold to private
investors it had a minimum buying of one
hundred and fifty thousand US dollars
and a promised annualized return of
twelve percent as of October 2016 they
had raised nine point 1 billion yen
which is about 1 billion pounds or 1.3
billion US dollars but now 72 of those
investors have filed lawsuits and who
knows what's gonna happen to this
massive bust thing geez the end of the
story talks about how the the dude in
charge of all this actually seen is
talking about like he wants to relocate
it to a different city which is weird is
weird if it's a scam or something like
that but I'm anyway I just I just
thought that was somewhat fascinating
there's other pictures I forgot to go
through there yeah so here's here's the
best thing there it is see that's why
that's why I'm just holding on to my
150,000 dollars yeah well I mean we were
both we were both considering investing
but mm-hmm
glad they asked me got they asked me and
I had to turn them down they just want
to put my name on it
smishing smishing is this a mash-up of
fishing and SMS texting yes it is oh my
god how did you guess that Wow
is it cuz you're reading something oh
man no it's simply Google Talk whoa so
smishing everyone be will ever want to
watch out for smishing have you been
smushed hmm I might have been smashed
before or a verb that's uh smishing
smishing like al mentioned had a good
fishing last nights like fishing like
you'd be sent spam email or something
like that trying to get you to click on
something or expose your information but
it's a SMS text message that you get on
your phone meant to defraud you
according to the article users tend to
trust text messages as opposed to email
which many people are suspicious of due
to phishing but you get a texted me like
hey it's a Texas I must open it no one
scandalous or of wit will ever texts me
no so there you got everyone the text
will try to get you to provide account
information such as login names
passwords or credit cards it might also
include a link so if you have a
smartphone like most people do
in the messaging app will often launch
something like a browser the messages
are often sent with the sense of urgency
sometimes they pose as businesses like
Oh your account tier is overdue and
you're like I don't have an account
there I better investigate it which you
shouldn't what you shouldn't do
don't do that alone but yes sometimes
opposes businesses sometimes they'll
pose as friends like you're never coming
back the other night you know I'm just
sitting here naked with my girlfriends
hey I don't have a friend named
Bartholomew yes maybe I do have a friend
named Paul if it's been so long since we
embrace all of you but if you but if you
were a Smasher why would you use the
name Bartholomew like I'd go with Mike
because you're looking for siding anyway
don't you need something unique and
different than people like huh I was
gonna ignore this but that's true but
now I'm interested or maybe because like
whoever clicks on Bartholomew the
Bartholomew text you know will fall for
anything else yeah it's just a way to
weed out all this mess have to send him
all this movies miss miss him so hard
now so yeah I never never tapped Lynx
cents via text message especially if
there's a RL shortened ones consider an
anti-virus the article says they
recommend ESET which actually is a
pretty good antivirus the guy they
interview for the articles from ESET
which might have something to do with
that but he said it actually it's pretty
good pretty good one I was gonna say
article didn't mention this this is my
personal advice my phone at least if I
get because I get spam calls a decent
amount to on Android phones at least I'm
not sure if you can do this on Apple you
can like long press the number or the
call that came in and then you can
either report it like report of spam or
block the number or whatever you're been
using the reporting tools that are
available to you I would say definitely
do that because that can immediately get
sentence like never gotten a call on
your phone where it says suspect
suspected spam caller yeah it's been
flagged and yeah that's cuz people have
reported that so right so crowdsource
you know the flagging of these bullshit
artists and hopefully they'll be less
effective I don't know
I can't really expand on this topic very
much but I over the weekend though I was
there kept getting spammed with this
number and one of the guys I was with
cuz I was at a bachelor party I tried to
call you a bunch this weekend it was
like was that you let me go ahead and
unblock your number really quick fault I
know but he recommended an app called
mr. number or something like that mr.
number or mr. I think was mr. number and
I downloaded it but I never like got
around to using it so I don't know maybe
maybe you guys could check that out
apparently it's for for blocking expand
and is saying you recommend it or it
gives you more information on calls that
you're receiving more than what your
phone natively gives you which could be
cool again maybe that's a good stand on
it much yes maybe it is alright mr.
number yeah missed missed your number
now mr. number like mr. oh I can miss
like the like looking like a gentleman a
gentleman caller yes we should make a
competing app called gentleman caller it
also sounds like a bondage toy like a
gentleman caller you're right so that
could get multiple there's all sorts
introduce products down opportunities
people need to take advantage of these
or we could just do miss his number
missus that's mistress number alright
one more one more sugar you talked about
in this is a great segment people are
confirming in chat that Mister numbers
are pretty sweet numbers good some
people have used chances so must be true
alright uh you remember being all
excited to buy a jean edited a tiny pig
like a little tiny pig wait what a
little bit all right so this articles
from MIT Technology Review there's a
there's a Chinese genomics Giants one of
the largest genomics company companies
in the world actually they called BGI
they're actually going public this week
you can invest in them I'm gonna do I
imagine it be
healthy payoff on the Chinese what's the
Chinese stock market called I don't know
it's nothing Nikkei is it I don't know
enough about stahma Nikkei I think
Nikkei is Japan or is that there's at
the entire Pacific Rim I'm not sure I'm
alright nevermind
I don't do stocks so do I point being
for a while people were kind of freaked
out because they were genetically
engineering mini pigs yes
in September 2015 and I think this is
something we talked about too
that's trying to make this maybe it's
like stuff we talked about in the past
that is now reporting on to be false but
I don't know if that's true or not new
segment yet new say yeah we'll make a
new segment about welcome to bullshit
bullshit Island anyway September 2015
there were some employees from this
company at the Shenzhen International
biotech leaders summit and they and they
said that they intended to sell half
sized bama pigs to inaugurate a market
for gene edited pets available in custom
colors and sizes custom colors yes nice
colors so it's like what are these
sleeping a tiny tiny pig and I want her
to be like turquoise right I want it
like a very very bright 80s turquoise
find me a picture of that pig Alice and
I want the pig to be that big that's
what I want and you just place your
order and then I cares your pig contents
cost $1,400 this is no this is true by
the way now we're talking about it but a
gene edited mini pig was gonna cost
$1400 and people were either really
excited about it if they're smart or
barb they're super pissed is there a
bunch of stuck-up prudence who don't
like United you know in many pigs
playing God or something like that it's
like just look at the mini pig it's
normal
customize new pigs so cute but anyway
it's all it's all for naught
although you can now invest as of this
week apparently in VG is they have gone
public
you cannot buy the DNA engineered mini
pigs they said they won't be marketing
the pigs to consumers at all we have no
plans to sell micro pigs note the
phrasing here though we have no plans to
sell micro pigs doesn't mean they're not
gonna make them
true this asana maybe they could have a
giveaway like what if they just gave
away the mini-pigs a thousand mini-pig
give away yeah I would enter that
contest very very quickly they just mail
you the pick I would make a bunch of
fake identities to enter that so I could
have a better chance of winning the mini
big yeah me too
maybe that's a quote from Jung Lee who's
a key member of their animal science
program Jung Lee what's wrong with Jung
Lee no no no I thought you're laughing
at the name no I'm good that's a guy
named king of dumb thoughts okay uh
China has apparently raced ahead with
gene editing technology in general
though they have also generated long
haired goats just what I would do first
if I had the power of God yeah and super
muscular dogs actually super muscular
dogs mad gains for you for your child
who those guys what even look that
muscular Hercules why would a dog Jani
go why would you need to try to make a
dog more muscular Hercules
we don't ripped my doggies that's
Hercules right there
what is a Siamese dog I don't know they
just fan they're supposed to be soup you
know maybe it's a relative term baby
it's cute dogs right yeah it's two
different dogs no no they're not they're
not conjoined or no they just I don't
know what the hell they're doing in this
lab they're the world's first Jean
edited dogs and they have more muscles
and are expected to have stronger
running ability which is good for
hunting police and military applications
God so basically yeah God quite
literally so basically we're just gonna
see this I mean this is like steroids
for dogs right no I know there's like
actually genetically genetic yeah
genetic modification yeah well then then
if it's not like steroids then
eventually it's just gonna be they're
all doing this to test it on humans
eventually they're just gonna test it on
humans be like hey look you don't have
to go to the gym anymore you just like
take this injection and and you'll get
super ripped like not even steroids
based but genetically enhanced muscles
and other things like here take a pill
while they already have that for
enlarging your penis but
I don't know I don't know I don't know
where I'm going with this I don't know
that I was trailer that's like that's
like I'm gonna I'm gonna respond Cal is
saying I'm gonna I'm gonna listen to
what he has to say you have a thought
for smile never a good idea because half
the time you know you'll say something
no but I got it I mean I wasn't even pay
attention what I just said seemed like
an asshole cuz I'm not nervous fun right
this time I'm gonna be really engaged oh
my god I got to see what all the hypes
about couch time coming what do you have
to say alright you can go back to
ignoring me for the resolution it's good
it's good we're doing it were to this
point we're not quite to the point where
we are inebriated yet no we have one
beer we have a slightly one beer yeah
you should I'm not a second now right
just ordinarily this odd okay cool
that's it so we're gonna go to
swordfight next and certify it's gonna
be slightly different this week we only
have a single topic and we're not gonna
debate it so much as we are going to
give you guys the thing to vote on Jenny
posting into chat right now and and yeah
and we're also gonna discuss it and then
we'll come back and see what you guys
think so I wanted to start out with the
question to keep things up and up this
is net neutrality I've been talking
about net neutrality just trying to
sprinkle it in here and there with each
show because it is an ongoing issue
right now and I don't know what you guys
think because I don't think I have
pulled our audience directly since all
right if you've watched the show you
probably know where we stand on this and
you might already have a pre-existing
opinion on this as well but I tried to
phrase this as neutrally as possible net
neutrality rules are in place right now
because the FCC classifies Internet
service providers as common carriers
under title 2 of the Telecommunications
Act which was initially from I believe
1934 or something like that there's lots
of arguments
well let's not just get into that yet
anyway so here's your responses that you
think they should stay in place those
rules in place force is peas to to
maintain net new child
you treat all packets as they're
traveling across the internet equally
some people think those rules should be
rolled back and that they shouldn't be
regulated as title to common carriers
and then of course they have a third
option which if you're not familiar or
you don't really care because maybe you
don't care maybe you maybe you're gonna
skip this part maybe you're going down
into the video's description hoping
someone who's done time steps for this
point so you can jump to the next end
that's fine that's totally fine the fact
if you're even watching this show right
now it means you should care though
that's true if you're watching anything
on the Internet we're doing an email so
the reason I bring this up more
specifically today is because in one
week Wednesday of next week on July it's
both there is being organized an
internet wide day of action to save net
neutrality what are we gonna do how does
it work there's lots of different things
that you can do this link is in the
description for battle for the Netcom
which is the central organizing body
that's putting this all together but
there's tons and tons of participants
the participants include Amazon Netflix
Kickstarter github pornhub reddit's port
hubs therefore we got a point those that
this list has been getting longer and
longer funnier dies on there I fix it
probably lots of companies who do
business in some way shape or form or
another on the internet who hopefully
maybe you've even worked with before and
think are good companies right - maybe
if the people who are doing stuff behind
these companies also think that net
neutrality is a good thing then maybe
that is something to consider this
website also has a quick rundown of what
net neutrality is which I've already
kind of mentioned so I won't repeat its
title two of the Communications Act why
it is important as far as maintaining
equality for the bits of inert data that
are traveling to and fro across all of
the internet and the series of tubes
that it is connected with what's going
to happen on July 12th which is a
variety of things you might have
websites that have blackouts you might
have internet users and people who are
just being a little bit more active in
communicating about it just trying to
have sort of organized swell of
information spreading about this in
general because that seems to be the
problem right now as a lot of people
really understand this fully I don't
really see what's going on or see it's
being pushed as a partisan issue or see
being pushed as an issue about
government regulation because there's a
lot of people who don't like government
regulations and you know and I
sympathize with that to some degree I
think there's a lot of government
government regulations that are stupid
but I also think there's points when
companies have a little bit too much
control a little bit too much freedom to
do whatever the heck they wants and if
there's a classic use case classic
points where you can say look at this
happening right now Internet service
providers would be one of those they
almost universally have some of the
worst ratings as far as customer
feedback goes because a lot of the times
in the United States you don't even have
more than one choice as far as where you
get your internet from so you I treat
your customers well if there's if they
have no other option to go to like so
yeah the people who are pushing for this
all seem to be in a position to greatly
benefit from it because if you're an
internet service provider and you have a
monopoly on the people who you're
providing your internet to and then
let's say you have a deal with some
publication or some content creation
site let's say there were multiple
YouTube's or whatever and you have a
deal with YouTube a and you set up
something with them so that all of their
contents you can say hey all of my
subscribers can get that content from
from YouTube a and there okay cool now
we can get that content but then later
because net neutrality rules aren't in
effect you say all right now all that
other concepts on the internet and now
you got to pay more if you want that
we're gonna put that stuff on a higher
tier of payment plan that you and I have
to pay for and pretty much do that or
you can't access that part of the
internet anymore it'll be like cable
like sort of premium subscription
channels like how you have to pay X like
you can buy the cable package but then
you can also do add-ons right if you
want HBO if you want to watch Game of
Thrones or like Silicon Valley you have
to pay extra just for HBO I mean that's
one of the reasons why I think most of
us nowadays like at least the people
watching this show and me and Paulie we
are on the internet more so than we are
on TV when it comes to like consuming
content
because of the way the model works on
the internet versus cable but net
neutrality if that goes away you're
basically adopting the TV model onto the
internet which is the reason we left TV
in the first place
so and that's why it's important yeah
and what what it's it's basically it's
allowing that to happen and there's a
lot of people who say like oh these
rules don't need to be in place because
the Internet service providers can be
trusted to do you know they can be
trusted to handle it themselves and
that's really what the ISPs will say is
like we don't need regulation it's a
free market economy everything will work
itself out and you know every every you
know free market every everything's
gonna be fine in the end but the problem
is that's sorry again I got distracted
briefly um it's well yeah squirrel this
is this is why I'm trying to discuss
this earlier rather rather than later
I'm worried for my half of the show Oh
God
why do you have anything serious to talk
about in your house no no that's
probably true I'll be fine we had a last
week we had a great about aetherium that
was way too late in the show yes I
apologize all right let's get back to it
that so so what is going on right now
and what can anyone do about this if
you've never heard of this before
so right now there is a what it's called
a notice of proposed rulemaking that is
open at the FCC and they're taking
comments on it so people can go to the
FCC's website and by going through a
series of forums you can say hey I'm
this person can enter your personal
information say like I am in favor of
you know title to classification because
I think that neutrality is important or
like I think net neutrality sucks and
you know you should roll back and get
rid of those rules that's how it's made
but the issue is that there has been
according to a lot of the research
that's been going on about a lot of the
websites involved there's been a lot of
abuse going on with that system if you
go to the website go FCC yourself calm
which was set up by John Oliver and the
people over at the show called last week
last week tonight that will take you
directly to that forum so you can fill
it out and there's certainly plenty of
for
letters that have been set up by people
who are in favor of keeping net
neutrality rules that have gone out and
the people have used because people like
what do I say and like I just use the
statement you can put it put it there
but now there have been a few more has
been a bit more research done on it
and techno crystalline Techdirt has an
article right now basically saying that
there's maybe some issues with the FCC
comment system going on first off it's
gone down at sort of weird times there
were suspected DDoS attacks I but that
seems to have gone by the wayside but
analysts are suggesting that up to 40%
of the roughly 5 million comments have
gotten 5 million comments on this so far
but roughly 40% are coming from a bot
that uses the same exact anti net
neutrality set statement on everything
it's this it's the exact same statement
every time damn box
up to 40 percent to 5 million is a lot
that's that's that's like to uh that's
like 2 million yeah to me any of those
right now there's some new reports going
on because the information that's
submitted on that is sort of publicly
available so people can can access it
also the information that you submit if
you use your name and address and
everything it is publicly available so
too bad that in minds although that's
somewhat important because there's also
been a lot of people who have been going
in parsing those things looking at
specifically those suspected BOTS
submitting comments that have that same
exact statement going in each one seeing
the information with the people that's
been provided contacting those people
and those people like I have no idea
what this is so there's a lot of
evidence that there has been a lot of
personal information stolen from people
that's being used for this comment
submitted in other people's names
comments submitted by dead people and
that kind of thing and there's also a
lot of a lot of sort of crosstalk you
going on I will say because there are
articles like this around this is from
the fiscal times why our kids will thank
us for rolling back net neutrality this
article is clearly aimed at older people
because it's like talking about
our kids the article is clearly clearly
anti net neutrality the article does not
go into anything specific as far as
modern discussion of net neutrality it
uses some very tired arguments like
Hello the title to the 1934
Communications Act talking about how
like why should the Internet be governed
over by something that was made in
nineteen nineteen thirty four I don't
know we have lots of stuff that's
governed by the Titans of the
Telecommunications Act of 1934 it's it's
it's just a term it's a terrible article
yeah I don't want to go into it too much
I'm mad just like thinking about it yeah
and it's it's I don't want to look at
the article but if I compares people who
are who are for net neutrality to
Luddites and basically sounds like it's
it's a it's anyway it's it's a stupid
article it's written by James bra hole
who is a research fellow at the Mercatus
Center at George Mason University which
is basically a locus on the board
Charles Koch it's this is a think-tank
that's funded by the Koch brothers will
have lots of money and anyway I don't
get to sidetrack too but there's a lot
of stuff going on on the Internet to
sort of spread misinformation about this
so this is why the day of action is
important to get more information that
is more accurate at about this and also
to communicate to people who might not
know otherwise so if you have people who
have no idea what net neutrality is and
they start asking you especially on the
July 12th when suddenly they have their
favorite website has a message that they
don't understand what's going on here
hopefully some of the things we've said
have helped make it a little bit more
clear to you guys yeah and I hope we've
treated this subject fairly too because
it's very important for the future of
the internet and for people who want to
be able to do creative things on the
Internet to start small and get big and
not have several large companies that
are largely controlling the transfer of
information from point A to point B
stupid caught others yeah
- so uh okay I read moving on to the
news now well this was theoretically a
swordfight segment so I did want to see
what people have to say about this one
the circles are where people stand all
right so we have 77 percents yeah we
cater to smart people the same place
you're all smart we got 30 percent who
think they should be rolled back ISP
shouldn't be regulated Charles we have
11% to are not familiar with it so it
seems like the vast majority of you guys
are definitely in favor of net
neutrality rules for people who voted
against it
I wish we could sit down and have a
conversation back and forth and discuss
it a little bit more in depth but for
now we definitely need to move on
because shows do meet hour and a half
each will do meet up or that's all we do
we just talked about neutrality but yeah
I'm do it tomorrow okay we're going to
check news yeah News News News News News
all right what do you got for us today
Paul we're still on time right yeah well
we got like donations Oh donations are
right so maybe I can roll through these
pretty quickly then okay all right so
starting off with this kind of random
story we've talked a lot about
self-driving cars and automation and
that kind of thing this is the first
self-driving grocery delivery van Leuven
look subotica this is in Greenwich
London in the UK the van is called a
cargo pod it's developed by ox potica
which is an autonomous system startup
spun off from Oxford University
it was rapidly constructed they say from
an off-the-shelf electric vehicle
drivetrain a wheelbase it's got to light
our sensors about the wing mirrors three
cameras about the front bumpers three
cameras at the back and inside the
dashboard there's a fairly standard
Intel Core i7 computer which there's
actually pictures of although they had
to pixelate it they wouldn't let them
see that wreck actual picture that's
inside interesting but the talkingest
Technica article by the way from by
Sebastian Anthony and he actually
ordered some food from the company
Okada which is the world's largest
online on the only supermarket which
must be more of a
EU thing or your Europe thing I guess
cuz I don't think they're I don't know
if they're in the US I know but you'll
notice there is a driver so that's yeah
there's I mean he's not actually driving
he doesn't drive it the cars this
passenger is autonomous it goes around
itself it's controlled by an iPad that's
wired directly into the PC onboard via a
USB plug so not quite into the wireless
technology yet
the autonomous driving software isn't
perfect which is why it has a steering
wheel pedals a big red emergency stop
button the guy who drives it says that
he it's mostly been ok but there's been
a couple times and like people just like
you know randomly here in front of it or
something like that then he has had to
you know make use of the fact that he's
there the article doesn't mention
whether that dude is going to continue
to be there whether he's just there
until the software figures everything
out right it can be relatively trusted
to to go to go on and do everything by
itself hmm
but yeah the the trick will he ordered
the stuff it rolls up you push a button
on the side it also wasn't very clear as
far as identification or whatever like
if there's not a dude there you know
like if you need a special scan thing or
something or like a code to enter and
box opens up you get groceries so you
actually go up to it and pay with like
ethic with a tablet though you've
already ordered you already ordered it I
see you've already ordered online and it
just cruises over to yeah and then it
rolls over and then it's got little
little containers where your box of
groceries is and then you just grab it
gotcha huh
so holds very much is coming yeah well I
mean it's it's a small vehicle it's made
for a fairly densely populated somewhat
urban area this is part of the trial
period for Gateway the Greenwich
automated transport environments hmm
which is possibly an area of this I'm
guessing I don't know the details on
that it sounds like an area of the city
where they're trying to set up for more
automation for for deliveries and stuff
like that interesting I can see this
being a hot target for homeless people
I can feel like homeless people just
like pushing it over cuz it's pretty
small yeah and just like right in
cheaper food in there I'm hungry this is
especially if that guy goes away I mean
first of all that guy's gonna be out of
a job if they improve the software
anything well if the guys got to be out
of a job it's
point anyway right I mean there's some
so I mean I got otherwise what's the
point of making the whole thing what do
you do for a living
I'm a driver for a driverless car okay I
sit there I'm gonna get fired and I just
fall asleep any day I walk up and get
their food I don't know it's pretty -
yeah completely urban area I'm not
positive if we have any viewers from the
UK who actually around Greenwich I'm at
least hopefully pronouncing it properly
Greenwich good itch bridge I know that
from Mary Poppins the whole world takes
its time from Greenwich Greenwich they
say it takes its time from Admiral boom
how do you just know whines I know
you're nerd random things stick in my
head dork all right quick mention here
of a eks m dot - nvme heatsink for next
generation form factor SSDs look at that
sometimes you water cool does your SSD
get too hot yeah it's like weird is it
weird even corner fittings seriously k
just one fitting so yeah it looks pretty
cool it looks clips on let's get a rigid
heatsink pretty low profile ek logo
there of course as all ek products has
available and a nickel or black finish
compatible with all single sided type 22
ATM got to nvme SSDs that are 22
millimeters wide and eight millimeters
long it does have a front plate and a
back plate though so here's here's an
example of two of them on an msi board
sexy which protects it looks pretty nice
and either color so there's a backplate
on there too so the compatibility is
somewhat limited when it comes to the
connectors the height of the connector
actually I really the distance from the
motherboard has to be a certain amounts
of some of the really low profile ones
or the stacked ones I imagine with two
on top of each other you might have more
of a challenge with compatibility with
but as you can see for most of your
typical motherboard MDOT two ports just
slots right in nine euros and 96 even
Euro cents for black and 12 euros and 90
for Euro cents for nickel what is a euro
what is it what is the hundredths of a
euro euro knees is a
hey hey here I don't know that is a
sense is it sense do they just call it
sense - well they don't call it a dollar
it's a euro oh yeah yet one euro and
fifty yet in yet spell EU ent your
roasted quid a quid really what is this
just since someone said just since it's
just since there it you're at Euro cents
pence is it pence pencil pen pen sense
why did all these names rhyme and just a
hey penny hey I don't understand a
little bit more even was saying just
since it's your alright since your sense
makes sense it does make sense
hahaha I sense dude Swift tech has a new
for a limited time fully customizable
CPU water block here it is here it is
right there this is the Apogee SKF block
and for a limited time you can customize
yours so you'll be able to mix and match
the components that are on there so you
can see there's different finishes as
well as different inserts here I don't
what that insert does I think it's just
an axe making
led in there yeah looks looks like it's
just an accent but um you'll notice here
at the end there's a bunch of different
of the the so you got chrome white
chrome gold matte gold rose gold rose
gold match with your iPhone red silver
black blue green and magenta and then
also the swift tech logo which pops in
there too can be various different
colors so for right now a limited time
although I don't think it says win that
limited time ends possibly when presents
they're 95 bucks you can pre-order now
and it's an entirely new cooling engine
made of densely packed fins that are
less than a hundred twenty five microns
thick super thin super thin water
channels if you want a water block maybe
maybe check that out alright two more
quick mentions here and I'm gonna do
these really quick because they're at
the end toshiba has just announced seven
hundred and sixty eight gigabit 3d qlc
manned flash memory quad level cell and
the big surprise here is the programmer
ace
the endurance so yeah these are the
first-ever NAND flash memory chips to
future qlc
quadruple level cell BICS architecture
the chips as mentioned are 768 Giga bits
that's 96 gigabytes in capacity per chip
and of course they can put multiple
chips on an SSD or something like that
64 layer three demons and the target
programmer eight cycles is 1000 which is
pretty close to the endurance of TLC
manflesh
triple level so that's one of the things
that sort of seems to get worse and
worse as you go from like single SLC to
to two bits per cell three bits per cell
four bits per cell is endurance tends to
fall off its counter balanced by the
fact that you have more more cells to
write to so it it does load balancing or
we're leveling I'm sorry yes and it
spreads the rights out but a thousand is
much more similar to what Aidan's
expected TLC so you're not going to
suddenly be seeing a big drop-off in
endurance here so that's kind of cool
they're not sure how Toshiba is doing
this and as you can so to see in an
image here as you go to the different
versions SLC only needs to manage two
different voltage profiles for a single
cell whereas MLC needs for TLC needs
eights and QC needs 16 so it's pretty
crazy the increased density as as far as
you know how many bits are going and
into each cell but yeah cool hopefully
there will be products based on that
soon one last story this was a sent on
Twitter from prophecies the prophecies
today micron has denied reports that
their fab 2 has closed down after a
major malfunction this is an oc-3 Gidon
net article there's some issues right
now with the NAND and dram production
and supply and that's why a lot of like
SSD price has gone up
and there's you know like Apple likes to
go and buy a bunch of it and all that
kind of stuff
so any difficulties with production are
it's not a good thing and apparently I
didn't catch any of these but they're a
bunch of rumors going on about fab - fab
- by the way produces about 5.5 percent
of the world
DRM websites had reported that
production at the facility had stopped
after a major incident contaminated both
wafers and equipment which would be a
very difficult thing because these are
all users are usually like you can see
in the picture here kind of clean room
environments they can't have any
contamination going on in there
and that would be a serious setback for
something like a major fab like this
micron issued a statement that confirms
that there was a small incident not a
major one did take place at fab 2 but
that it was not a nitrogen leak as had
been reported and that it was recovered
from quickly so hopefully there was no
actual long-term delay in production
because that could adversely impact the
RAM prices and we don't want any of that
nonsense already high enough yeah so any
reports to that effect or false
thanks for offices for sending that over
as could have gone under your the other
segment of bullshit the bullshit it
could have feels like one of those
stories where like you know websites I'm
not gonna mention any names but certain
ones that are more prone to blowing
things out of proportion might have just
snagged this up and be like what could
this mean maybe they did like I said I
didn't catch any of the stories on this
but I wouldn't even surprised if if you
read about that yep alright let's
quickly run down some donations we did
get a collection here thanks to all you
guys who did that turner short automatic
Matt coming in first 5 bucks thanks so

recently probably a silly trick and
probably a lot of people are just with
this news mash the power button if you
double tap the power button and it loads
the camera so it's genius double tap the
power to load the camera yeah I I just
took a picture of my finger that's how
quick it was that's one of the awesome
things about to pixels how quickly the
camera app loads you like loaded up and
like even switching over to video it's
just like yeah so fast so you can grab
picture
really quick then yep yeah I found that
to be very helpful helpful yeah I bet
there's lots of phones there's also a
fingerprint sensor oh yeah fingerprint
sensor that's super nice use that

like all you guys if you use adblock we
don't mind we understand but if you want
to do something like that hey that's a
classy move very appreciated Fred to
rant with another rant and when on $10
donation to Titan x4 monitors all four
monitors to one GPU and SLI or two
monitors on each Titan I believe NVIDIA
has a web page on their website that
says what's recommended for that and I
used to know this and I know at one
point it was he wanted to one monitor
per display or like split him - and -
but it maybe I feel like lately I've
been doing all in the top GPU that's
what I've been doing like so like I
didn't even realize that there might be
some advantaged yeah I know there was a
thing it up well cuz because when when
triple monitors like was first becoming
more popular and it could be really
finicky to set out set it up properly so
um yeah it might not even really matter
anymore yeah yeah I think Paul and I
have just been plugging if we have
multiple monitors and even multiple GPUs
like hot line right now is just
everything's plugged into the top GPUs
are just good at the top one no issues
if you don't have enough connectors then
I don't think it's a big deal - yes but
and maybe double check that Nvidia page
just to be sure
it's got Dilbeck six dollars and 66
cents who would win in a Mexican prison

Fred rants $20 donation just for that
great arctic panther returns video Thank
You Fred why is your house at 81 81
degrees uh your temperature setting was
in one of the scenes I am I
my thermostat was that's actually what I
usually have the AC set to 80 81 really
yeah that's hot
it's not that bad I don't know I don't
know it doesn't it feels fine to me so
I'm okay with it
wait your thermostat was visible in a
video or something and people are coming
up yeah like a day the shot with me
walking carrying the computer and you
can see the thermostat that I am maybe
one is pretty toasty and keep it at 78
here it's really not that bad maybe you
get better ventilation in your house you
need some one-story house too so yeah
probably no it's 81 and I'm usually
walking around in like shorts and
sandals yes I mean that helps me stay
cooler all right Matt Grimes 50 freaking
dollars thank you Matt ripped by PCIe
cover off my extension cable on my micro
ATX lammle pc 0 6s while cleaning 85
bucks to replace it geez should I
replace the cable I get a PC 0 7 s X go
full ATX and build a new system current
to z97 4690k 1070 SC @ my pc stay in
blue gosh that's a really expensive
replacement for a PCIe expansion
extension cable I guess if you have to
buy it from Lee Ann Leith and that's
probably why it's so expensive I don't
know I don't know if you could get
something else where I don't know if
it's I'm not as familiar with that case
I don't know if it's a custom design
more or something like that but yeah I
don't see if you could find a
replacement elsewhere or anything you
just deleted sorry it's the wall
mountable one oh it's the x1 no you
burned many I did or that micro ATX no
no it's a bigger one no it's the more
like full size okay wall mounted one but
I you know like you should be able to
buy riser cable or like extension cables
for PC a cheaper than 85 I mean if
you're in the market for an upgrade I
mean you got a z97 and a 4690k so you're
not too outdated or anything like that
but I mean if you're in the mood and you
want to get a little bit more
performance than you and you're feeling
it then sure go fully ETX but I feel
like you might have other options
besides just shelling out 85 bucks for
that replacement piece yeah but yeah Lee
only cases are expense
look on eBay maybe have some yeah
possibly Thank You vet all right a
couple more Damon boys $5.00
will we be at LTX the Linus tech tips
Expo meetup thing we're not planning to
go at this points don't think so yeah

Damon but yeah we're not currently
planning to go that star Lou finally
with a two-pound donation and I 525 50k
still worth it is that a thing 25 50 K
who is that the one that didn't have the
IGP you another unlocked I five brothers
won 16 gigs of RAM for $50 that's a
great deal forgetting all that and it's
all functional that's a good deal that's
a good deal
that's perfectly functional I mean I
don't know what that I don't any 550 K
there's a 2500 K at 2,600 ka-27 in these
oh there is a 25th of DK this is the
Sandy Bridge it's quad-core I'm guessing
I think this yet no I GP I was right no
I GPU yeah so there's no I GPU yeah I
mean 50 bucks that's a that's a
perfectly functional viable systems
unlocked if you can overclock it you
could probably game fine on that at 1080
hopefully the motherboards like z77 or
z68 and not like H or B something yeah
make sure that you make sure the
motherboard is also an unlocked
motherboard which would be P 67 or z68
make sure if it's a P 67 motherboard
that's not a really really early P 67
motherboard cuz they have that SATA bug
mm-hmm but let's see 77 work do ya see
77 would also be functionally alright
