hey everyone how's it going - welcome to
Paul's hardware today's video I'm I'm
kind of excited about I'm actually
mostly excited just about today that's
because today actually marks the kicking
off of the installation of my new
electrical system so tesla powerwall and
what I actually did today is a main
panel upgrade because my electrical
panel back there is from the 60s so the
power wall and the solar actually isn't
going in for another week so not going
to be showing that today but I am
working on a video on that when it
actually happens so for today I'm just
gonna make kind of a Bloggie style video
I'm gonna see how I can get by cuz my
power is supposed to be out for like 4
to 6 hours I'm gonna see if I can still
manage to get internet and play around
at some UPS's inside and beyond that I'm
probably just gonna do like chores so
thanks for joining me today and stick
around to see what my day is like as my
electrical panel gets upgraded so I
don't really show my backyard too much
because there's not really a whole lot
going on out here last year I did a
shittiest vlog ever where I I mowed the
lawn and I'm gonna have to do that again
soon but don't worry I'm not gonna make
a video about it this time but here's
the back of my house the solar panels
are all gonna go up here on the back and
that's going to be facing where the Sun
comes in so that's an ideal location for
those and then over here is of course
the electrical panel and as you can
maybe tell this thing is like super old
that's a hundred a hundred amp panel so
they're gonna upgrade it to a 200 amp
modern panel that's compatible with
solar and everything like that
originally the plan was to do a sub
panel off of this one but since I want
to do some further work in the house I
wanted the upgrade though so I could do
some dedicated runs into the garage for
power and we're hopefully gonna redo the
kitchen kinda thing to see that's gonna
get swapped out they're gonna need to
cut a hole in this wall this over here
is actually the fiber connection size
fiber to the homes
is originally was Verizon but now it's
actually handled by frontier and I'm
gonna see if that will still work if I
can power the modem inside the house I
might still be able to get internet even
if the power is out so do a little
experiment there and for anyone who's in
an apartment or somewhere where you have
power outages I have had the experience
before where as long as you can power
the modem you may still be able to get
internet which may or may not be useful
for you know look in here has come to
say hello
Hado they're a big boy and you're still
groggy he just woke up
encounter my first setback of the day
first I couldn't find my my GoPro I'm
here before I like to use this for time
lapses so hoping to set up a time-lapse
of the process today did find it but
unfortunately it seems as though the
battery is just completely dead totally
did a good job planning ahead today so I
must see how much of a charge I can get
on this before they show up to turn the
power off got a fair amount of clutter
going on out here but it's ok we're in
between projects time to start shutting
down non-essential computers well I
pretty much got to shut down all the
computers art depent there's already
sleeping
all right so for now because I need to
get this set up I ran a bit of extension
cord out here just to keep it plugged in
make sure it's still charging while I'm
waiting for the power to get shut off
all right SD card is installed got 64
gigs on there which is plenty for a
lengthy time lapse and as long as I can
keep this thing powered you should be
able to capture this whole thing I
should also ask the installers if I can
film them first before doing anything
but at least I'll be ready
the trick for getting a good time lapse
of course is making sure the shot set up
before hints so GoPro app is key for
that to make sure I can line everything
up also it's got a wide-angle thing and
a narrow angle thing and oh look it's
working and I definitely want the narrow
angle for this wide would be way too
wide all right video photo 8 where's the
flip one photo every two seconds the
medium angle and I had to change the
rotation back second actually see what
it's seeing and since it's right setup
now I was I actually had it mounted
upside down last time I used it so I had
flipped the display but there we go
this is functional which is good and
just finishing things off with the bit
of a sandbag at the bottom to hold
things down and make sure it stays
steady OSHA compliance and all of course
and the time-lapse rig is set up now he
approves what do you think of the
time-lapse Regnery he's not interested
at all I have good news
they've arrived work has begun and we
got approval for me to record them doing
a time-lapse so right now the dogs are
inside and they just gathering stuff out
here preparing the work area look a
ladder it's amazing no he's very mad
that she's not able to join this
everyone is here okay so work is
underway but I wanted to do like an
unboxing up of my new breaker panel here
this 200 amp panel from Eaton look how
much bigger it is it's glorious that's
where the electrons go and then we lift
up here and we can see look we got a
master a master switch we can actually
with one switch turn off the power to
the whole house very convenient thing
that before I was forced to work with a
bunch of different breakers
assume there's other stuff going on in
here but since I have no idea what I'm
doing I'm just gonna be the look yes
they're gonna relocate the this is the
fiber box this is where the fiber to the
home comes in and Wow
apparently this should be sealed at the
bottom to prevent like lentils lots of
lots of deadly creatures from making a
home inside there how many did I know
like I'm getting an arachnophobia vibe
there's probably an actually King spider
at the back it's gonna jump out
it's my new copper
the power has now been turned off
they're removing the my old box my old
main panel and I've come inside just to
make sure I tried to prepare to make
sure everything that needed to be turned
off is turned off but I do hear the
beeping of my UPS is warning me that hey
there's no power this is why everyone
should have a UPS power goes out
EPS stays on and down here we can see a
readout of how much estimated time is
remaining
based on the loads we got good couple
hours worth but granted has just got one
computer connected to it on standby
right now I don't want to pull this out
of here and see if I can mess around
with it
he has inspecting the gear you approve
here yep he approves you guys helping
Johnny here is feeling playful give me
in Belarus Patrick's god bless you god
bless you Oh what are you doing here boy
what are you doing I'm turning over for
belly rubs yes okay
those are good belly rubs
rip old electrical panel we hardly knew
ye you served us well electrical panel
from Paul's house born January 1964 died
April 20 18 nomine Patri fili spiritus
sancti amen
heroes doing some inspection work at the
midday points crews over here having
some Jimmy jams and the main electrical
panel has been removed now we have the
guts of the house hanging out vital on
fails it's all fascinating okay I move
back inside so I could test my theory
I took my UPS here moved it over to the
family room
nowt here of course is where the htpc is
as well as the verizon frontier fiber
node connection right there so just move
this over here turned it on and I have
plugged into the back the connection to
the actual Verizon router guy over there
and then I plugged in this power strip
and the power strip has power for like
the Verizon router here as well as my
secondary router that's daisy-chained
off of it a couple other things have
plugged into that but the main things I
needed with a Verizon and this one which
has my Wi-Fi on it
fortunately the you Wi-Fi booted up
properly I have connected to it and I'm
going to run a speed test right now and
show you guys if I'm still getting my
full speed connection I believe I am
although honestly I'm supposed to be
getting a hundred up and a hundred down
we're gonna up that upload speed yeah
yeah and they have it according to the
Google speed test I've got 83 down and a
hundred and fourteen up the downs a
little disappointing but that still at
least proves that I actually have a
functional working router fiber
connection even though the power to the
rest of my home is out so the lesson to
be learned here which I learned in my
apartment a while back but any of you
guys who suffer from power outages this
isn't always going to work because it
depends on whether the power is out too
like the local connection point that you
are connecting to and that kind of thing
but very often you have a power outage
in your home but if you can
get power to your modem to your router
and have some wireless battery operated
device to connect with you still can't
which is pretty cool and useful if you
just want to you know play around on the
internet while the power is out but also
much more useful and helpful if you
maybe are in an emergency situation
where you desperately need access to
information or connectivity
maybe maybe I'd save someone's life just
now probably not see how things are
going outside
okay guys the test the crew is just left
and I'm gonna quickly go over their work
done it's not completely dead and I know
the power while I dinosaur yet but the
electrical main panel has been upgraded
and some of the interesting things you
learn going through something like this
is that your house that was built you
know 40 50 years ago 50 plus years ago
is no longer to code so like this pole
up on top is now much taller
the old pole was shorter than that by
the way the utility Southern California
Edison in my case is gonna need to come
when all of this is done and do an
inspection before they sign off and
everything and at that point I guess
they're gonna replace some of these
connectors up there so those are just
temporary so that I still have power
until next week when the power wall gets
installed so the first thing they did
was relocate the FiOS box and
fortunately this rear portion of that
actually had a big coil of fiber-optic
cable in there which is very useful that
gave them enough length to move it down
here and give them a little bit more
room to work with then up here we have
three boxes and then this bottom box
here is just to connect our box for all
of them inside the main panel we have
the main on/off switch so I can turn the
whole system on or off which is cool
I've got a couple breakers in here 30
amp which is going to go for the AC and
then 100 amp which actually passes over
here into the sub camp this sub panel
here everything that's connected to this
will be backed up by the power wall so
on here I got a bunch of 20 amp and a
few 30 amp breakers in there so that's
cool
if I only have a 30 amp breaker for our
oven which was wired up in kind of a
weird fashion before but then finally we
have this third box here and this box is
actually specifically for the power wall
I understand it actually has Wi-Fi and a
3G connectivity built into it so that
you can always have
in control for your power wall even if
your Wi-Fi goes down so I don't know
much about that box there but then
everything is of course connected
underneath then there's still a little
bit of stucco missing there but they're
gonna patch that all up once that final
installation happens but guys that's all
for this video so on behalf of Hiro and
myself and Noorie
who have been here all day I want to say
a big thank you to the Tesla installers
Jonathan Johnny Yuri and Corrib they
were here all day they did an amazing
job and they were all really nice guys
so I learned a little bit by asking a
few questions along the way but I'm
still not quite to the level of a
licensed electrician anyway guys more on
this project coming probably in another
couple weeks cuz I got a week till the
powerwall and the solar goes in but for
now I hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed this video thank you very much
for watching and we'll see you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
