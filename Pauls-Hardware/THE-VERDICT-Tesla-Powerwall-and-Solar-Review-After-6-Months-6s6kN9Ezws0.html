this is my long waited follow-up to my
Tesla solar system and power wall
installation which I documented over the
summer in 2018 and I promise you guys I
was going to do a follow-up where I gave
an assessment of the actual performance
of the system the cost involved whether
I think it was worth it as well as any
other details I think might be useful
and that is what we were doing today
let's get started of course here's hydro
series RGB platinum coolers are made to
keep cool even in the most thermally
challenging situations with mlpro RGB
fans included to maximize performance
with minimal noise as well as a pump
with a thermally optimized cold plate a
low noise design and dynamic multi zone
RGB lighting with 16 individually
addressable LEDs find out more about
Corsairs hydro series RGB platinum
coolers via the sponsor link in the
video description so let's start off
with the timeline how long did it
actually take for this whole project to
get installed and up and running it has
been 15 months since I did my initial
$500 deposit for my tesla powerwall and
in the in-between we've had hurricanes
we've had some snafus when it comes to
scheduling but ultimately everything did
get up and running but I actually kicked
this whole thing off on September 4th
2017 I put a $500 deposit down and the
idea at the time was get this installed
now during winter and possibly spring so
it's ready for the summer of 2018 and
we'll see as we proceed how that
actually went on the 13th I was
contacted by a Tesla rep to proceed with
the project on the 15th I requested
assistance getting an entire system put
together not just the powerwall but also
solar panels and potentially a main
electrical box upgrade on the 19th I was
advised that the plans for my system
would take about 30 days to complete and
that there would also be a potential
delay due to disaster assistance that
Tesla was participating in due to the
Hurricanes last year in Texas Florida
and then eventually in Puerto Rico with
hurricane Maria in October of 2017
I sent them some copies of my utility
bills and I received my first power wall
order confirmation email but it was only
for the powerwall
note that I had asked for assistance
with a main panel upgrade and solar as
well so moving on to November 2018 I
pointed out that the plan only included
the power wall and that I wanted solar
and electrical panels well I had a call
with a Tesla rep on November 9th and
then we signed updated project documents
on November 13th planning to go ahead
with the power wall and the solar note
again that the main pan
still was not included although I will
take some responsibility here because I
didn't notice that either on November
13th they did the first site survey and
actually sent out a rep to walk through
and do a solar meter that they put up on
the roof in the back to sort of gauge
how much solar was being received in
that location this was also my first
introduction to Tesla safety procedures
and I actually really appreciate this
they secured all the ladders when
they're going up and down not off of the
roof and they always drill into the apex
of the roof and use tie downs with
harnesses for all of their employees
that are working on the roof again just
for safety and I think that's a good way
to go about doing it also in November I
registered on the Tesla website because
Solar City was actually starting to be
phased out Tesla has a better brand name
since Elon sent his car into space so
Tesla now in that Solar City they merged
together and then all the documents were
signed by all relevant parties on
November 26th and I was still
anticipating delays at this point so it
was a month later on December 23rd that
I got the installation scheduled email
yes
for 4 months later in April so April 2nd
and this again was due to power wall
orders being backed up due to Puerto
Rico hurricane Maria relief so I was ok
with that although I want to point out
that I did ask Tesla after the fact if
normal people should expect this amount
of delay and they said no it should
happen much quicker however if you go on
the test website right now they're
currently delayed until like next year
sometime they are backordered so I don't
know what to tell you exactly but this
was my experience so moving on to
January 2018 and I received my first
initial contact with Southern California
Edison who is my local utility here who
Tesla has to work with in order to do
all this stuff after that point I was
copied on regular email updates between
Edison and Tesla but I did not need to
participate at all they handled
everything between the utility and Tesla
team an SCE engineer was assigned to my
project on January 17th so jumping ahead
to March on march 8th I had my first
Tesla site walkthrough apart from the
initial one that they did in 2017 and
then after that we had some scheduling
issues Tesla somehow had two
installation teams assigned to my
project they're gonna try to install
early on March 20th but that was never
actually confirmed so a team showed up
that day but we weren't ready for them
so it got pushed back to April 2nd
everything was ok though I March 26th
Jerry one of my favorite Tesla Tech's
who I worked with showed up to do
another walkthrough he also discovered
at that point
the main panel upgrade was not actually
set up yet so we had one week to kind of
scramble to get that main panel upgrade
arranged added to the project and it had
to be approved by Southern California
Edison as well I was worried it was
gonna delay stuff even further since it
was already April but fortunately they
were able to expedite everything and we
move forward with the main panel
installation on April 2nd about a week
and a half later on April 11th I paid
the first half of my invoice and the
solar was scheduled to install but then
the team arrived they inspected the roof
and they decided that my roof was too
old and we're now they have a policy
that they will not install solar on top
of a roof that is too old and might need
to be replaced soon which makes sense
but they usually let you that know that
at the beginning of the installation
process so fortunately they said because
they hadn't caught that they offered to
cover the cost of reroofing the area
under the solar array so that was like
bonus free part of a roof for me which
is cool although it did introduce a
little bit more delay to the
installation so the power wall was
installed on April 11th and then a
couple weeks later on April 26th we
scheduled the reroofing with Tesla's
roofing guy Adolfo and that was
scheduled for the week of April 30th to
May 4th on May 2nd the roof was replaced
and then on May 11th the solar array was
finally installed and then you have to
wait again maybe as little as a week but
up to a month they said because the
utility has to give permission to
operate so we had a couple weeks we're
waiting around I was hoping to turn it
on because I was going to leave for a
couple weeks to go to Japan and Taiwan
for two weeks at the end of May and
beginning of June and then of course as
we're at the airport on May 25th
I get the permission to operate email so
we had to go away for two weeks before I
could come back and then actually turn
the system on which I tried to do on
June 11th as documented in my
installation video it was unsuccessful
at first on June 12th I called Tesla I
just sort out registering my gateway to
my account D from Tesla helped me out
with that and then I was able to turn
the system on Rey so that is the recap
of the installation from initial deposit
to system being turned on in mid-june it
took quite a while again your mileage
may vary if I have any advice to offer
for you it would be to know what you
wants at the beginning because I sort of
said hey guys I'm signing up for a power
wall baby you could also figure out the
solar and the electrical panel I needed
to be a little bit more forthright with
that and be like I want this this and
this and then I think they would have
had the plans ready from day one and we
would have maybe not had to deal with
those delays that happen in
little time in like December January and
February moving on to my actual setup
though the specs of the system my solar
panels are model SC 325 solar city 325
which is 325 watts per panel that's peak
if it's getting full sunlight and making
all the use of all the sunlight and I
have 18 panels so that gives me a five
thousand eight hundred and fifty watt
peak output array of course you're never
really gonna hit your Pete peak output
for various reasons efficiency and how
much Sun is actually hitting in the
direction of the sunlight and everything
so I'm actually dealing with probably
more around five thousand to fifty two
hundred Watts peak generation my main
electrical panel is now a two hundred
amp panel upgraded from the 100 amp
panel that was here from the sixties
when my house was first built and then I
have a 100 amp subpanel and that is what
the tesla powerwall is connected up to
so that is the battery backed up
circuits on the 100 amp panel the
remaining hundred amps for my main 200 a
panel are fed over to my air conditioner
unit I was initially told that the AC
wouldn't be backed up by the power wall
but I think it kind of is actually more
on that in just a minute
finally of course I have the power wall
to and that features a fully integrated
Tesla inverter 14 kilowatt hours of
energy storage five kilowatts of
continuous power and seven kilowatts of
peak power round trip efficiency is 89%
for the AC power wall that I have and
the operating temperature range is
negative 20 C all the way up to 50 C so
that's a pretty wide range for most
people it also comes with a 10 year
warranty with unlimited cycles so that's
pretty nice
too in case you're wondering it weighs
269 pounds or 122 kilograms now if
you're actually going to be using your
solar end power wall setup you will be
using the Tesla app this is actually
pretty useful because it lets you see a
live view of solar generation from your
solar array that's in yellow also it
shows you how much power your home is
currently using that's in blue also how
much power your power wall is delivering
to your home or if it's charging from
the solar that's in green and then your
electric grid power is listed in white
if you're drawing from the grid or if
you're feeding power back to it so a few
examples here of solar generation here
at my home going from summer to fall to
winter so back on July 7th in the heat
of summer I generated 32.2 kilowatt
hours on a bright sunny day where I was
getting most of the solar generation for
most of the day it's not too bad
although of course it's hot at the time
too so you have to bear that in mind as
well on September 23rd in fall I
generated about
five point six kilowatt hours this is
also on a bright sunny day so I'm just
trying to see in the best conditions
depending on the month how much power
I'm actually going to get of course the
days get shorter here in the winter as
it does in most places that's not on the
equator so if you move to December
actually December 9th just recently 22.7
kilowatt hours is how much power we
generated so as you can see it's gonna
dip down in the winter and get better in
the summer so I have a few examples to
share with you guys so back on July 8th
we have a heavy a/c usage day it was
very hot outside we had to have a/c on
and we drew 50.3 kilowatt hours for the
entire day there now on this day you can
see draw spikes in the 8,000 watt plus
range which is far beyond what the power
wall is actually actually able to handle
so you're gonna always be drawing power
from the grid on a day like that when
you're drawing more power than what the
power wall can push to you so there you
obviously draw some grid power on that
day we actually drew 21.6 kilowatt hours
from the grid but you can see there's a
good 30 kilowatt hour gap there that was
covered by the solar so that's nice
let's move over to a worst-case scenario
day it's hot and it's also partially
cloudy and it's still the summer for
some reason that happens sometimes late
summer here in California we got 25
point one kilowatt hours from the solar
on this day it was pretty spotty during
the day it was kind of partially cloudy
off and on
we drew 28.9 kilowatt hours from the
grid and that was due to the heavy
air-conditioner usage that we had going
on throughout the day but we also only
had 1.8 kilowatt hours drawn from the
power wall which is much less than the
previous example where we had about 30
kilowatt hours that is because the power
wall started with low power because we
had had several days of heats where we
were using the AC during the day the
power wall would run out at nights and
then in the morning when it's supposed
to start charging itself back up again
when the Sun comes out we're turning an
air conditioner back on again so the AC
is using up so much power that the power
wall can't charge therefore we only got
1.8 kilowatt hours of usage from it but
again that is a worst case scenario with
50 3.5 kilowatt hours of home usage on
that day let's switch over to November
jump for a couple months and we'll talk
about a rainy day because rain is nice
here in California it keeps fires from
happening and stuff but it also keeps
the Sun from shining so on a rainy day
we get 5.1 kilowatt hours and you feel
like your solar generation is pretty
used
we also used 18.1 kilowatt hours that
day so you can see there's a pretty
substantial gap that had to be covered
by the grid and if compared to just the
day prior we got twenty two point four
kilowatt hours of solar generated and
that was on a bright sunny day it was
nice that those work back-to-back so I
can give an a/b comparison between the
two the other thing that happens in the
colder months here is heating starts to
become a concern my wife gets chilly so
we have a portable electric heater that
we use in the bedroom house heating is
fortunately handled by natural gas but
you can definitely see small spikes in
usage on that day from the heater
cycling on which of course does increase
power usage even when you don't have to
worry about the air conditioner and one
more example day here and this is
actually the 12 hour charity livestream
that we did just a little over a week
ago so on this day of fortunately it was
cool so we didn't need to turn the air
conditioner on and I was actually pretty
surprised that with our three-person
streaming setup that we had going on out
here in the garage
we were only drawing about 1,500 to
2,500 watts for most of the day there
was also a bright sunny day so we had
twenty two point seven kilowatt hours of
solar generated that was able to charge
the power wall while also providing
power for us while we were out here
gaming and stuff so that day we didn't
even have to switch over to grid power
until about 8:00 p.m. this is on a day
when I was expecting we were gonna be
burning up all the power that was coming
in so I was pretty happy about that and
also a great demonstration of how the
battery allows us to stay self powered
during those key evening hours when
power draw typically increases in
residential neighborhoods and often your
rates can increase as well on that day
we use thirty eight point nine kilowatt
hours total which is a lot considering
that we didn't have the AC going so when
it comes to general usage the thing I
noticed most of all I think was just a
couple months ago in October when I kind
of forgot it was there the month of
October was actually a good month when
it comes to solar generation it was very
dry here in California but that meant it
was very sunny and I was also pretty
cool out so I didn't need the a/c we had
lots of solar coming in wasn't using
exorbitant amounts of power so we
actually got a credit in October of
about twenty-five dollars the other
thing I mentioned earlier is that the
air conditioner was not supposed to be
powered by the solar and the power wall
but I think I know how it actually works
even though the AC is not directly
connected to the 100 amp panel that the
power wall backs up we have a two phase
power delivery system here so I believe
what's happening is when the AC is on
its drawing power on one phase to power
the air conditioner while it's also
feeding power back
the powerwall on the other phase so from
SES perspective it's a net zero and so
effectively we are powering the AC with
the storage power here so I believe
that's how it works don't quote me on
that for sure but at least when it comes
to functionality and usability that's
the only way I can see it working says
it's physically not connected otherwise
and now on to the cost-benefit analysis
I know a lot of you guys have probably
been waiting for this I'm going to take
into account the upfront cost of the
system we also have a tax credit that's
coming in actually I'm going to be
getting that tax credit in another month
or two when I file my taxes for 2018 and
then there's also of course the
estimated time that the system might
take to actually pay for itself so I
have about three full years of electric
bill history from 2016 to 2017 to 2018
however I can only really do direct
comparisons from July onward because of
course the solar and everything wasn't
installed before then so if I'm looking
at the last five months of the year July
through November you can see that my
average power bill was about a hundred
and eighty four dollars two hundred and
eighty seven dollars in 2016 and 2017
now if you look at 2018 my July bill was
eleven dollars and 81 cents my August
bill was the most expensive one at a
little over seventy dollars September
was about eleven bucks in October I got
that $25 credit and then in November
we're at about ten dollars so I'm a
virgin about fifteen dollars and 74
cents per month that I am paying in my
electric bill which is pretty minimal
but some people were like well shouldn't
you be making money on this Paul maybe
but let's take this a step further if
you compare what I'm paying on average
per month now to what I paid on average
per month in 2016 and 2017
I'm saving about a hundred and seventy
dollars per month one 69.6 nine
according to my calculations the overall
cost of the solar and powerwall system
including the electrical panel upgrades
that I got was thirty two thousand four
hundred and twenty-five dollars and
seventy five cents I paid this upfront
because I didn't want to finance it and
if you calculate that it's actually
still pretty expensive and it will take
quite a while for me to recoup my cost
on this but you also have to take into
account that right now there is a
federal tax credit of 30 percent towards
your solar system that you have set up
so I'm going to get a tax credit of a
little over nine thousand seven hundred
dollars that will apply towards what I
owe for taxes so I will owe about nine
thousand seven hundred dollars less on
my taxes this year which is pretty nice
that means my total cost was twenty two
thousand six hundred ninety eight
dollars divided
that by the savings per month of about
170 bucks that gives you about a hundred
and thirty three months that means I
will pay off the system or the system
will pay it for itself in just over
eleven years about eleven point one five
years to be specific this does fall in
line with my expectations when I was
getting the system installed the
anticipated time to pay for itself was
ten to fifteen years so that's just
about right and I want to point out that
the solar array has a twenty year
warranty and the powerwall has a ten
year warranty and the entire system has
an estimated useful life of thirty five
years so hopefully the powerwall won't
give out prior to me having the system
pay for itself but the powerwall is
actually not that difficult a thing to
swap out or even add a second one to but
assuming that my average cost savings
stays about what it's been so far I
think it's safe to say that I am happy
with the investment I have made so far
so let's talk about pros and cons what
do I like about this system well one it
just works not to quote Jensen or
anything like that it's been functional
and like I said during the month of
October I kind of forgot it was there
and it ended up getting me a credit also
speaking of it's really nice to get a
credit on your power bill from time to
time or at least know that when you're
not here like if I go on vacation during
the summer or something like that it's
still here sucking up the Sun juice and
converting it into electrons and all the
sciency stuff that goes on behind solar
power the final thing to point out would
be that it was was nice to get like half
of a free roof from Tesla although
that's not something that people would
usually expect but it was good of them
to cover that once they discovered that
it was something that needed doing
although it did delay the project by a
week or two but it wasn't too bad
as for dislikes though I have noticed
and this is a minor thing but either the
solar inverter or the power wall is
right on the outside of my bathroom our
ensuite bathroom back there and it makes
the noise kind of a weird just a noise
that I can hear from time to time like I
said it's minor we can only hear it in
the bathroom but that I pointed out I
would also prefer to not have the
always-on Tesla reporting square that's
got to be connected to your network that
sends telemetry data back to Tesla all
the time it's always got to be there
it's always got to be on and the Tesla
will turn itself off if it doesn't have
connection to that after a period of 24
or 48 hours or something like that
it's weird also considering that there's
a pretty stark lack of detailed usage
reporting available on the Tesla website
if you log into the Tesla website it
basically shows you what you have
installed there's nothing you can see as
far as like what it's been used or
anything
that the app is pretty detailed on
what's what it shows you but only for
the past day or two if you go beyond
that it just gives you bar charts
without too much actual specific numbers
on there and there's no way to like
exporter or porch or anything like that
those are some features that I feel like
it would be really nice to add in the
future and it would have made making
this video a little bit easier - finally
it is nice to have the battery backup
but if you wanted to have the battery
backup or sort of view it as an
independent system like if the grid went
out or if there was a zombie apocalypse
and the internet didn't work anymore and
the grid didn't work anymore you would
still be kind of Sol with this system
again because of that Internet
connectivity requirement for the system
I'd like to have a zombie mode where you
can like shut yourself off the grid and
still be able to get solar power and use
your power wall just in case of some
horrible situation like that to give
yourself a little bit more usage out of
it without having to like get back on
the Internet in order to get it to turn
back on finally I want to remind you
guys that I am in Southern California we
have much sunlight here all the time or
a lot of the time so the effectiveness
of solar for you is gonna vary greatly
depending on your weather of course you
can always add more panels to your array
if you aren't generating enough
electricity for your needs
but that of course ups the cost of the
system - my advice for you is to let
Tesla know upfront what you want
installed especially if you're going
beyond the power wall it's also
including a main panel upgrade and then
finally I wanted to give a shout-out
thank you to the folks from Tesla who
helped me out with this installation
that includes Jerry Powell Johnny
Jonathan Cora and Tom from the
installation team and then on the
planning side ian connor melissa and Don
were all very helpful in this
installation but guys that is gonna wrap
it up for this video thank you so much
for bearing with me as I have waited so
I could have some actual data to share
with you guys about my usage of the
power wall over the past six months or
so also a huge thank you to any of you
guys who use my Tesla referral link
which is down in the video's description
if you happen to actually purchase
something from tesla powerwall or
otherwise they do not sponsor me or
anything like that but if I get enough
referrals I can potentially get a free
red power wall signed by Elon Musk which
would be super cool and would also add
to my my power capabilities here in my
home thank you all so much for watching
though and one last teaser I know this
video has been long anticipated and I've
delayed it but I have one more coming
soon a follow up on the HTTP see
unprecedented anyway guys thank you so
much for watching we'll see you next
