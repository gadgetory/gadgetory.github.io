talking to this perfectly exactly on
time all right
so punctual and another moment or two
and we should be we should be good to go
as we did seems to be all right thank
you for tweeting Kyle I I'll have to
retweet you yes my phone because my
computer is no longer login hello
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
live show we talked about technology we
drink some beers occasionally adult
language so warning to any of you guys
who might be offended by that we stream
live to youtube.com slash Paul server my
channel and then we're gonna do the
second half on Kyle's channel bit wit
will scream the whole thing on Twitch
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware and
we've been doing this for a while now
this is m25 episode that's 125 we're
almost getting to the point where we
need to like stop putting the episode
numbers cuz people look at it black man
that's just sad no still flogged in that
we shouldn't we shouldn't let him know
that at horse we've done the show this
many times and we're still not partnered
with this is what we did with theirs
there's laws there's rules against that
are there well because we cuz we do cuz
we dual stream we stream to twitch and
YouTube we probably could if we wanted
to make an effort get twitch to make an
exception for us because we know people
there maybe maybe I'm not sure maybe
it's which is too big now maybe they're
maybe they're too big and they wouldn't
do that for us but I always thought it
was because that dildo incident that
dildo indocin incident was somewhat
notorious which did get in contact with
us about that but they were pretty but
then we redeemed ourselves at the bottle
popping incident that's true they even
which we also which is now fodder for I
finally found your wonders
we're no longer on their shit list okay
they're beware of these guys they're
dumbasses list or at least just me yeah
and that's totally fine I can live with
that
alright first off a quick plug for our
stores if you guys want to help
yourselves out and get some final
merchandise check out my store mmm
pulsar Burnett's new merchandise I am
actually sporting the awesome hardware
sword fight shirt we have new awesome
hardware merchandise whether you order
these from my store or from
Kyle's store it doesn't matter cat it's
it's there's gonna be some math done and
Kyle and I are still gonna be splitting
it between us I also have stainless
steel bottle openers now which are super
high quality I just recently got some
and they almost they almost cut me
they're so sharp and refined we also
have some shirts for that that we've had
designed by people who have said because
we have a district design contest going
on this one's hard to be everyone by
mudsy and and so check that one out if
you enjoy it anyway also mugs pint
glasses Cal stores big with that tech
slash store he's got the beware of
bottleneck shirt celebrating his that
time when he has free beer all over my
garage still find in stains still stains
from Kyle's visits every shirt comes
with a an original beer stain yes that's
not true we also have some ladies shirts
you know go buy it buy your significant
other as I'm assuming this because most
of our audience is male where were some
ladies out there too if you guys want to
buy shirts but you know if your dude and
you want a lovely gift for you your wife
or girlfriend or just some girl just
some random girl or guy on the street or
a guy who likes the ladies cut t-shirt
they're very slimming anyway or anyone
who identifies with dragon sprite yes I
have one quick announcement for my my
half and that is just that my my
giveaway that was going on for the past
couple weeks has ended the the winner
was picked and was announced earlier
today and that was his name I forget
what his name was his Zek his name was
Zek not Zach Zach was from Wyoming so
big congrats to him he as far as I can
tell has not claimed his prize yet so
come tomorrow 24 hours after he was
contacted if he has not gotten in touch
with me we will be drawing a new and
different winner and Zach will have to
say oh heck
what if what what a pain in the neck
what if we just started drawing winners
by actually drawing a person's face and
then whoever looks the most like the
person we draw wins the giveaway Christ
so it was very feasible
totally totally can do that we have with
today's hey today oh look at this this
is awesome
somehow this lines up now choose to
cupcake hmm my goodness we started a
little late today so apologies to you
guys for that we were just yeah I got
here late in the need to everything I
looked over here to do my first segment
which is insecurity and I saw security
list as I go lower thirds even I didn't
set them up or there but no choose the
cupcake but this is actually no longer
the cakes damnit I'm gonna assume the
Kyle was hack dammit I'm gonna send the
Kyle was hacked and didn't even know it
that's what they did they changed it to
choose the cupcake so there's some big
crazy stuff going on with IT security
stuff information security and we're
actually starting off with maybe one
that you might not have expected me to
start off with but I have to like the
vaguest idea of what information
security actually is but I follow some
people on Twitter who I think have a
much better idea and several people
mentioned that this actually is probably
a bigger deal than the second story
we're going to talk talk about about
Wi-Fi being not secure anymore
this is Infineon or basically there is a
large company named Infineon and they
make specific chips and there has been a
flaw discovered in the code library the
fatally undermined the security of
millions and millions of encryption keys
used in some of the highest stakes
settings including national identity
cards software and application signing
and trusted platform modules protecting
government and corporate headquarters
Thank You Kyle for your ongoing efforts
to
to make the sound as perfect as it can
possibly be bored anymore so experts use
your own volume knobs at home if you
need to yeah so this allows attackers to
calculate the private portion of any
vulnerable key using nothing more than
the corresponding public portion of that
key which is kind of a big deal the
public portion is supposed to be
something you can share and the private
portrait portion is not so that causes a
pretty significant problem the private
key can then be used to decrypt
sensitive data sneaked malicious code
into digital is digitally signed
software and bypassed protections that
prevent accessing or tampering with
stolen pcs so for instance you might
have a very important government
computer that's got very important
sensitive information on it and they
have these protocols that are in place
for implementing information security
they have actual standards and that's
one of the big issues with this one of
the frightening things is that there's
two major internationally recognized
security certification standards that
the this breaks basically the flaw
itself is five years old but it was only
recently discovered it is located in
code that complies with two
internationally recognized security
certification standards that are binding
on many binding on many government's
contractors and global companies this
flaw was discovered by a Slovak and
Czech researchers from the Masaryk
University in the Czech Republic enigma
bridge in Cambridge UK and kapha Scotty
University in Italy and I apologize for
my horrible pronunciation of any of
those words I just said the code library
was developed by German chip maker
Infineon and has been generating wikis
since 2012 at the latest might have been
implemented earlier than that by certain
institutions or governments the library
runs on hardware Infineon sells in a
wide range of cells to a wide range of
manufacturers using Infineon smart chips
and TPMS trusts are trusted platform
modules if you have no idea what I'm
talking about but you watch standard
tech videos on PC hardware and
that's the closest you might have gotten
to this is when we'll keep going up your
motherboards and there's a TPM headed
and for most home users you like there's
TPM header you don't need to care about
that but a trusted platform module is an
actual physical piece of hardware that
plugs into that that basically makes the
machine accessible and has valid keys to
work with specific software and that
kind of thing so it's a kaviraja dongle
yeah they are in the same family they
are the same family that is that's
correct so this this has some major and
far-reaching implications largely due to
the fact that whereas the Wi-Fi thing
affects a large number of people this is
affecting some very important people in
some very secure environments that
weren't intended to have a vulnerability
of this sort
fortunately the people who discovered
this aren't necessarily your your your
your black hats or hackers or anything
they're actually you know I had their
names up here but I probably would've
horribly missed pronounce them anyway so
it's probably good that I apparently
didn't copy them but the people who did
research this I mentioned the
universities that they come from they've
put together research paper paper it's
titled the return of coppersmiths attack
practical factorization of widely used
RSA RSA module a module a module will be
presented a I'll move your things
entered on November 2nd at the ACM
conference on computer and communication
security to give people time to change
keys this paper describing the
factorization method isn't being
published until it's presented at the
conference and then I have a secondary
article here all these articles linked
in description by the way first one was
from ARS technica by Dan Gooden this one
is from bleeping computer by Catalan sim
ponnu but yeah a little bit more
information here just kind of on on how
the Infineon TPMS work and that kind of
thing if you guys want a little bit more
reading I am going to cut this off
because I have several other things to
talk about but operating system vendors
are showing workarounds for this the
effect that hardware is probably going
to need to be just shit-canned and then
moved to something else the types of D
pm's that are affected oh and bear in
mind here as very specifically it only
affects Infineon TPMS so don't think
that all TPMS are affected and yeah the
ones that are affected are used in
business laptops routers embedded and
Internet of Things devices no one
affected vendors include Acer Asus
Fujitsu HP Lenovo LG Samsung Toshiba and
other smaller chromebook vendors that's
pretty wide array so moral of the story
is that not all trusted platform modules
should be trusted Nega I guess so
like they should probably change the
name now well I mean it could be the
type of thing the table that taints
people's understanding TPMS I feel like
I feel like the people who work with
TPMS aren't aren't the kinds to to
suddenly start mistrusting all of them
but this is it this is a pretty major
security vulnerability that has been
discovered and I thought we should leave
the show off with it because for anyone
who doesn't care about this stuff you'll
care about anyone probably you know I
want to I want to weed them out so they
get borden all right next up a little
story from ZDNet crack sure why not have
you are you on crack yes no trick
question
crack is y5 ulnar ability that's became
public knowledge yesterday yesterday
Monday morning this is a bug that
effectively breaks wpa2 wireless
security and say what you will about
wireless security in general
wpa2 is kind of the the broadest feature
that's used by the most people that
actually is you know so amount of
security against people just being able
to look at everything that you're
transmitting over a Wi-Fi network
however wpa2 has now been cracked by
crack capital K capital R capital a
capital C cam which stands for kiri
installation attack it is at hurt a
fundamental flaw in the way Wi-Fi
Protected access to or wpa2 works the
issue is the system's 4 Way handshake
that
it's devices with a pre-shared password
to join a network this was discovered by
security researcher and academic matthew
van hoof and threat actors who are
taking advantage of this can leverage
the vulnerability to decrypt traffic
hijack connections perform man in the
middle attacks and eve drops on cave
drops
leaves eavesdrop eve drops easy drop he
was a drop like attorneys-general
use drop on communication sent from a
wpa2
enabled device us search which is the
united states computer emergency
readiness team has known of this book
for some months but they informed
vendors ahead of the public because now
you're probably gonna have a bunch of
you know of younger younger hackers so
we're just getting into it who are like
crack it sounds cool give me some of
that and crack me some Wi-Fi but they
didn't want to give the vendor it's a
little bit of time to kind of get their
affairs in order so you may have noticed
the headline of zinnia net articles
here's every patch for crack Wi-Fi
vulnerability that is available right
now now this is this is a big deal in
various ways because it affects many
different things now fortunately base
level if you're using a Windows system
of windows computer and you're keeping
it up-to-date you're probably just fine
Windows Microsoft has already issued a
patch for this and an update however
there are many many other companies that
make many other different types of
things not just you know computers with
Windows operating systems that use wpa2
encryption in order to communicate over
Wi-Fi and those are now vulnerable to
this so yeah in general Windows and
newer versions of iOS are unaffected but
the bug can have a serious impact on
Android 6.0 marshmallow and newer so
Android users be aware this is
devastating for Internet of Things
devices because they're often already
bad at security and they're often not
routinely updated or might not have
over-the-air update capabilities the
list of vendors is in this article here
again it's alphabetical there are many
on there I was going to highlight just a
few Apple has fixes for iOS Mac OS watch
OS and TV OS that are in beta we'll be
rolling it out in a software update in a
few weeks
Cisco
Cisco wireless products are affected by
these vulnerabilities some patches are
available others are pending Google is
aware of the issue and will be patching
any effective devices in the coming
weeks Google in this article actually
seems to be among the lesser prepared
for this but I'm not sure it might be
because if Android is particularly
vulnerable there's lots of different
Android devices using lots of different
versions so it might be a more difficult
thing to fix via updates intel has
released a security advisory listing
updated Wi-Fi devices because there's
lots of Intel Wi-Fi devices out there
remember they they make Wi-Fi chips
patches for effective chipsets as well
as Intel active management technology
Windows machines generally considered
safe security patch has already been
distributed and is available also
through automatic updates again I have a
secondary article here and check him in
the description but yeah what I just
said Microsoft is already patched
windows against the crack Wi-Fi when
we're building there's a 1-1 point for
the mandatory Windows updates that we
usually tend to hate on yeah I mean they
seem to come at the most inconvenient
time that yeah I guess on the plus side
they do some things right yeah when
they're protecting you from stuff like
this it is good mm-hmm
well cool so does this mean if I have a
wireless heart like Wireless external
hard drive that's wpa2 encrypted then
that's probably one herbal yeah or like
an ass that might be wpa2 encrypted yep
all right duly noted everything needs
updates turn everything it does seem
like the type of thing that can be
updated via like if they can push a
firmware update to fix it when this
first came out I saw lots of articles
that were saying everyone's going to
need new routers now like everyone has
to get new routers that doesn't appear
to be the case immediately but you know
depending on what hardware you're using
and how easy it is to updates and again
whether the manufacturer whether it's a
connected device that the manufacturer
can push an update to or it's something
that the user has to actively go and
update themselves was going to make a
big difference so you're gonna have lots
of devices that aren't updated and that
are vulnerable right despite the all of
you who now are now aware of this and of
course all of your friends you're going
to tell about
and freak him out he's Wi-Fi anymore
don't do that but I mean that yeah and
if you spread information like this to
friends who might be less technically
inclined part of that problem
no you're doing a good thing you're
doing a good day helping them part of
the solution yes because yeah this is
this is the type of thing that I wonder
if this will lead to any like more like
IRL theft because now people could
technically hack into other people's
surveillance secure like surveillance
camera systems disable the cameras and
then break in essentially without a clue
left behind yeah it's interesting it's
messed up some messed up stuff
yikes yikes burn all the things alright
one last story here in from the
insecurity segment adobe has patched the
end another flash zero-day exploit I
feel like this is just I feel like I've
said all of this before adobe flash its
articles from security weak by the way
but flash players security update was
released on Monday by Adobe it patches
is here zero day vulnerability that it's
been exploited in targeted attacks
already the security hole CVE - 2017 -
11 292 described as a critical type of
confusion issue that could lead to
remote code execution that's bad a
number of vulnerabilities found in plant
the articles pointing out because I fear
of like flash vulnerabilities are just
so common dark points at its actually
decreased considerably considerably in
past months there have only been four
issues resolved in August and September
that's only a rate of 2 - per month good
job Adobe anyways no one uses flashing
if Adobe's insecurity is yeah Adobe's
insecurity in Flash's sorry Adobe Flash
is insecurity in general is what has
caused Adobe to make the decision to
kill flash mmm good flash will no longer
be hates flash anyway I'm starting in
220 fire by 2020
forever and it's it's already it already
is disabled and doesn't work in many
many browsers by default so usually you
have to go and like tell it like no I
want I want to do this the flash thing
there's better software it doesn't feel
pain but I happen to have to do that
during sword fight and that sword fight
during face-off yes all right let's move
on to our quick sponsor spot yes indeed
hey quick sponsor spot deep ones I think
awesome hardware for the month of
October in the his house yes Lara she
blows oh yes captain
kept in 240 X today should make that to
mix things up a little bit we're gonna
unbox these at the same time oh man last
time we did these once it one of the
time too hot to handle then kind of
thing on your half and your half we're
gonna put them I think back in the boxes
okay you're thinking outside the bottle
so realized at the air conditioner in
your has gone out turned off yes I
really do need to bring like an
industrial-sized box fan in here
specifically for this show we should or
we could just change the time of this
show to like 9:00 in the morning when
it's literally like 21 see in here it's
super cold you know what's nice about
deep cool what Paul the word cool yeah
it is I'm feeling cooler right now it's
such good branding probably as a result
of deep cool I might change my channel
name for a 50,000 time it's a bit cool
cool bit cool sauce net collecting it to
the beer this man if you have to hold it
up and see what you've done your
creation is no way that that's gonna tip
over
see bad engineering good engineer go
look look do you see anything fallen
right look look at this some dangling it
and stuff it's it's just it's not
falling to pieces like that was I got it
super good high pure quality okay a deep
level of Cooling's can be had
so the product we're actually showing
off is deep cool captain 240 X which is
a 240 millimeter radiator all in one
liquid cooler comes in a variety of
different finishes we're doing black and
white but in light that is a variety
people don't discriminate if you do want
some additional color though these are
both RGB and so the center part here
will light up in RGB colors and it's
fantastic just a reactor reactor looking
waterblock also available with the white
finish on the radiator here as well as
the weights
oh no I finally took the cap off and
smudged the how dare you so you got the
white finish that's available there as
well and it comes with LED strips and
you get LED strips in the box comes with
5050 RGB LED strips that do include the
power connectors and extensions there's
a controller attached to it as well
which is nice so you can control it
either just with the cable itself a
little controller that's built in or of
course connected to your motherboard and
control it through a software like asus
or a sync phone or mystic light from him
aside cetera RGB fusion from gigabyte is
this oh this is just something like a
fan hub or pin pwm fan hub yes let's say
you can't get if you go push-pull on the
fans you can connect them all up pretty
sweet pardon me I really quickly wanted
to show the actual flight F light a
penis there it is captain 240 X and
let's look at the gallery
so you can see the central part here
likes up showing red there but different
colors are video that's boom no it's
contains content from Sony Music
Entertainment Japan
oh no available our country Oh however
don't worry deep cool I know what you're
going through hell with that in the past
it it's many times little RGB control
unit which is very useful to have in
general our TV strip than they see
central part like this too
big thank you to deep below for
sponsoring all link to their website is
down in this video's description let's
move on third face yes indeed hmm so
everybody what do we argue like this
shirt that I'm wearing oh it's beautiful
shirt the Brian designed yes saleable in
the store what is it now you guys are
probably already aware we've we've kind
of been covering the 1070 TI from rumor
onwards you know we we were originally
quite skeptical of the 1007 TT I like oh
yeah looking at invidious lineup it
didn't seem like there was much of a gap
there or whatever but um it does seem
like it's gonna be a thing and it hasn't
been officially confirmed yet but
there's enough rumors and scuttlebutt
pictures leaking out that kind of thing
that people are expecting this to happen
there's been some leaked specs it's
gonna have a lot more cuda cores in the
standard 1070 2432
and that's only one what do they call
them now sm x sm yeah whatever the sm
unit i think it's one i think it's one
grouping of cuda cores less than the
1080 but the latest rumor is that it
won't be able to overclock it's gonna be
locked the frame the the frequencies of
like the jeep you know it might it'll
probably do boost up to a certain point
but then they'll cut off this article
from pc games end comm is saying no and
isn't gonna do that and there's a little
bit of explanation as to why they think
that it's the case they think it's
mainly stuff that's being told
manufacturers that is being
misinterpreted but never mind all that
let's assume that it is true the fucking
video yeah
no let's assume that is true and
therefore it is the subject of today's
sword fight and we're gonna be arguing
about it so if the rumored NVIDIA GTX
970 ti which is also remembered to be
locked for overclocking if it is true
should should this be left we have
various answer answers that we can
answer with here yes it's their GP and
they can do what they want
no GPUs are meant to be overclocked and
this sets a dangerous precedent cuz like
do you know of any completely unlocked
they're like not overclockable GPUs most
of them you can get in there yeah fiddle
around I'm gonna actually don't know
then use matter if you use afterburner I
don't know any modern GPUs that don't
allow you to overclock yeah strange I
put a few other options in here just so
people have some can mix it up a little
bit boobs if they want yeah I get boobs
done it I'm so so yeah pick your poison
you know the chat of course we need your
feedback here if you guys want to throw
your votes out you'd be much obliged and
I just really say I think cell has been
posting it's just really as my live
stream was set to 6 p.m. so everyone
probably thinks I'm 14 minutes late
why are you so late change the 7 ha
thank you so thanks for muttering for
his cell by the way thanks so he's doing
a great job
alright so Kyle what do you think I'm
gonna go first I'm gonna say I'm gonna
say yes I'm gonna say they're allowed to
do it yes here's the deal I'm gonna
combine my answer with another secondary
answer here which is this cat seems like
in videos bored right now they don't add
they're not a whole lot to do you know
they probably had something lined up to
follow up with Vega but then Vega
couldn't beat the 1080 T Isis like well
I guess we can just keep on with the
1080 yeah it's doing a great job there
is our flagship card with nothing that
can really beat it
and so they're like well what do you got
going on for the rest of the year now
that we have nothing else to do I don't
know well you know they can't just do
nothing they have to work they have to
produce something you know economics and
all that kind of stuff Jensen doesn't
just sign off on the paychecks unless
something's named produce is like all
right let's you know reach into the old
you know idea box and pull something out
and this is what they came up with
let's wedge something in there you know
that's a higher higher value card that
you know can may push some sales and you
know they make a decent amount of money
at that price range and everything
around 400 bucks
big challenge I mean to the like the
Vega 56 right now because Vega 56 you
can't even buy for the normal price so
it's like does it need to be challenged
probably not but they're like oh let's
throw it out there and see what happens
but as a results they took something
that was sort of an in-between chip
where you know obviously there's still
details forthcoming on this we're not
sure if he uses the same exact you know
are these just 1080 GPUs that didn't
quite cut you know make the cut so
they're just shipping them out with one
of the one of the s I mean it's disabled
or whatever but yeah point is they need
to be able to make a product that
doesn't cannibalize there are other
products it's probably was something
that they weren't going to do anyway so
yeah if they won't lock the frequency
the lock the frequency because they
can't have us 1070 that they sell for
400 bucks or whatever it's gonna be
suddenly be able to overtake or even
match performance in a lot of situations
with the GTX 1080 because that costs
$500 and they gotta be able to charge
$500 for that no make that money no no
no no no Paul no one's gonna pay over
$400 for a GPU they can't even
overclocked yes they will no they won't
they're a bunch of suckers most most
people who are paying over $400 for a
GPU are gaming enthusiasts and gaming
enthusiasts like to tinker and mess with
their hardware poor choice of words on
my part but this is something that is
just expected now users have come to
expect that if you're going to buy a
premium GPU or even any
GPU for that matter here in 2017 that
you're gonna be able to play around with
it and and push it to its absolute
limits instead of having this locked
ecosystem or locked environment where it
just ships out of the box and you and it
just and it just does nothing well it
doesn't do nothing it does a lot it can
game fine but you know what I mean it's
it doesn't make any sense for them to
lock the clock speeds because they're
first off there are no other cards that
do that and there's really no other
reason why you would lock it other than
for some you know anti user reason you
know - maybe preserve the sales of their
GTX 1080
because if you uh if you unlocked if you
had an unlocked 1070 TI it could
probably match or even outperform a GTX
1080 so at that point it doesn't seem
like locking the GPU is servicing the
user the end user at all it's really
serving the company and that seems like
a dishonest marketing ploy to me I rest
my case the only thing you said that was
accurate is that it's 2017
let's see shit let's see what the
audience thought though I thought it was
2018 everyone's had sufficient time to
submit their votes
I bet boobs would take a look at results
if you're watching this move all right
we got boobs followed by the GTX 970 TI
really doesn't even need to exist that
was popular yeah no computers were meant
to be overclocked in this sets a
dangerous precedent pardon me it looks
like that means Kyle wins whoo
because I only had 15 percent of the
vote with 32 you had I'm losing track of
what's what's what here yeah you had 17
percent was 66 and I do want to point
out art we were only split by well you
had like double weight but by BA no I
have eight percent what am I talking
about
percent you had 17 percent so all right
but if you combine your two answers
together you're right because you wanted
percent I did
to it therefore over 20% of therefore I
win instead it works okay I should start
adding boobs to every straw poll from
now on all right I'm trying to trying to
go through the show fairly quickly today
again I was just kind of because we kind
of started late and I don't want to
don't I keep you all too long but we're
moving on we're moving on to the next
segments and that is news gtx 1070 TI
ttys 1070 TV sorry that's I'm that would
sell I am 5 sell very well it would
according to our survey like get bring
back the trend of like the screens you
know images on the graphics cards or
whatever but it's just like boobs it's
sort of like the the dual fan design is
just due to massive tits yeah you know
would you have to do ones with dongs on
it too though just like the gold to
prevent it we need to keep it from being
sexist I think so
so if you had that and you wanted to do
SLI would you go with quad bores with
for boobs boobs boobs in the dong or or
the double doll that's double dong
that's gotta be I'd say I'd say our
third certified question for quadruped
the boobs
yeah those that's probably I would do -
yeah
I don't know if dicks in my system I'm a
bit it's a symbol of power
mandolin DD I mean I have a question for
you Paul are you uh are you a boob guy
or you dick guy boobs I think go for the
thick we all know the answer I'm just
trying to I rest my case
trying to be equal opportunity all right
let's move on to some news here look
brief a brief little tangent all right
Google is parent aleni
they're gonna put up a fight with Amazon
Amazon of course taking over the world
recently recently acquired Whole Foods
now they have now they have all the
foods because they have the whole the
Whole Foods the Whole Foods this is
actually from late last week on Thursday
Target and Google announced they're
expanding what was previously a years
old delivery partner
shit they're going from a small
experiments that they were you doing in
a handful of cities to the entire
continental US this expansion will allow
target to become a retail partner and
Google's voice shopping initiative
because they've been pushing that out a
lot if you guys saw a lot of the pixel
stuff pixel to you talking about pixel
to honey or half a little bit little bit
time up its to him Cass after yeah stay
tuned for that pics stood for example
comes with the point of those Google
home speakers they sent me a thing cuz I
ordered my pixel to listen things like a
you get a speaker nighttime like I want
you get I don't want your damn speaker
yeah yeah I don't know smart speakers
that's absolutely nothing so the smart
speaker battle will be between Google
home and the Amazon echo and products
derived thereof I do like that I mean if
you're gonna go for one of those the
Amazon echo I think it's the dot the one
you have to product right the one where
you push it to ask it something yeah I
don't know I just I've still not sold on
that although my complain about this
arrows but no my phone's doing that the
always it's always listening to you your
phone's always listen to you
okay Google my films always listening to
me I mean wants done like right now but
it's still her but I just said wait does
it do that for me yes it's always on you
can turn it off
okay Google huh it does so anyway as I
sit here saying like I don't want that
in my home it's listening to me all the
time and realizing that my phone is
doing that yes I'm horrible hypocrite
but still turning my phone maybe I can
minimize the number of devices that are
recording everything I say all the time
that might be kind of useful as a part
of this seven weeks ago actually
Walmart's also inked a similar deal with
Google to offer hundreds of thousands of
products so yeah the C's appears to be
the the tying in of like major online
presences Google and Amazon which were
probably close to the top of that with
established brick-and-mortar
places that maybe have had a more
difficult time kind of getting their
their online sales up and off the ground
I mean Target Walmart they they they
they both have healthy online you know
websites you can go buy stuff delivered
in that kind of thing
but I say they don't really hold a
candle to Amazon but tying in of this
might provide more of a competition or
Amazon but apart from the whole voice
commerce thing and being able to say ok
Google I did it pick that up okay so and
so I delay I delayed so wouldn't it
wouldn't actually pick that up being
able to say that go you know I want this
thing from Target and then again it
shows up at your door in a couple hours
like that's that's kind of what they're
what they're getting at here where I
want this thing format from Walmart or
whatever but beyond that they're also
promising to create innovative digital
experiences using other cutting-edge
technologies to elevate target's
strength and style areas such as home
apparel and beauty experiences that
digitally replicate the joy of shopping
at a Target store to discover stylish
and affordable products ok right there's
a joyous experience do you enjoy it do
you have a joy you have joy in your
heart when you visit Target
mmm yes very much so
it makes me moist ok the whole
experience I I leave I leave Target just
so if I got a target I go to Target for
a very specific thing or small group of
things and I go and I get those things
that I leave that's how I am anytime I
leave the house I only leave the house
to get like a specific thing or a list
of things I'm on a mission to ever leave
the house to do that and then think to
yourself others these other things I
could get to maybe while I'm not a dick
no I'm only going to do this I will do
nothing else I'm usually the opposite if
I think like but cuz it but it's like
it's like uber laziness cuz I'm like
that way I only have to leave the house
once if I can just get it all in your
head then I never have to leave the
house for like another two months I
guess I'm thinking of more like non
acheté essential stuff oh it's so
essential I could do this while I'm at
it or whatever but no every everything I
get has to pass a test and the test is
do I need it to live yeah it's good it's
been tested yes
so yeah clearly this is pointing towards
augmented reality shopping which would
be you go to a shopping place like your
Walmart or Target and maybe you
Aaron glasses on or something like that
and as you're going around you know
little probably little characters pop up
and yeah and they offer you cigarettes
drugs they're fun whatever they sell it
target assume they still that kind of
thing at Target or virtual reality
shopping which is from the joy from the
comfort of your own home you know put on
your HTC vive and go walk around and
pretend like you're shopping at Target
or Walmart actually the verge of the VR
Wal Mart experience as a shooter like it
you know going post there at Walmart
okay I'm just just saying I mean Walmart
shoppers are already on pretty much they
look like resident evil enemies because
they're already good to go I mean just
take actual images of real Walmart
shoppers and you've got yourself a whole
army of baddies yeah you get that in a
virtual environment what do you call it
the you'll need to be FG people of
walmart or whatever this is yeah exactly
go to that website if you dare real-life
nightmares all right next up the FCC
little story here on net neutrality
following up so net neutrality we've
discussed on the show we this this is
one of those topics that sort of starts
overlap into political territory I mean
we've tried to avoid that when we can
that we may have our own opinions but
this is something that I've tried to ask
people as much as Popples trip possible
tress step away if you have political
leanings and look at this from just the
perspective of the Internet's and how
the internet should work net neutrality
is just the free exchange of the packets
across the internet they should all be
treated equally and that your net
service providers shouldn't be able to
say some packets go slower than others
and that kind of thing right now net
neutrality is enforced by the FCC
because internet service providers are
classified as common carriers under
title two provisions which are some laws
that are in
back in the day this means that their
utilities they're treated as utilities
and utilities for example can't say Oh
water costs more for this first of all
they can for that's not a good at size
you compress it but utilities have to
provide equal service to all the people
is what I'm saying um and they can't
suddenly say that one type of thing
that's being delivered by utility is
worth more than the other that can't be
well they're they're there to provide
that to you so the FCC opened up a net
neutrality feedback back in May it was
yeah I was like late April May that they
actually kick that out and there they
claimed that there was a DDoS attack and
distributed denial-of-service that
basically their servers were inundated
so they shut down there was a lot of
criticism at this time because there was
a piece that went up on youtube as well
as on HBO by John Oliver in his last
week tonight as part of his last week
tonight specifically about net
neutrality got a lot of views a lot of
people were like I feel strongly about
this and I want to go and make it
comments the site went down and a lot of
a lot of people like that seems like
kind of suspicious timing right suddenly
that goes down right at a time when lots
of people are going in posting pro net
neutrality comments spurred on by this
thing so over time this was months ago
again this is towards the beginning of
this year there have been many attempts
to get the FCC to provide more
information about those DDoS attacks and
like what exactly happens ready records
basically show us show us the hitch
you're getting right you know show us
some evidence that this actually
occurred yeah they have not given
anybody anything there's but they've the
tiniest little trickle of information
that they've given when requests have
come in so digging into the medicine yes
so take it to the next step senator
Brian Schatz who's a Democrat from
Hawaii and representative Frank pallone
so a senator and a rep who's a Democrat
from New Jersey requested the
investigation into this back in August
by the US Government Accountability
Office Gao Gao recently confirmed it's
been accepted they're looking for
evidence that the attacks actually
happened they just want to say show us
the evidence was
because there should be evidence of this
but from surface level was this
obviously not just the site going down
from the influx of traffic like was it
depends very attractive there are there
are both there there are there are two
sides to this arguments yeah I would
argue that most normal people are on the
side of net neutrality is good and most
people who are against net neutrality or
very large companies who have can make a
lot of money if net neutrality isn't
around and those companies and the
propaganda that they've put together to
try to convince people otherwise yeah so
yeah I mean there's there's obviously
arguments on both sides there's reasons
why they're you know maybe maybe it was
a DDoS attack maybe maybe that did
actually happened but all they want to
say is show us the evidence that this
actually happened yeah if it's all true
and it really was DDoS that that if they
really weren't ddosed and it should be
very easy for them to pull them they
should be able to prove it and hopefully
they are able to either do that or if it
actually didn't happen and there was
some something surreptitious going on
then you know maybe hopefully we'll find
out
yeah there were more than 22 million
comments filed on net neutrality while
it was open and it was extended after
that due to all the comments but most of
them were actually generated by form
letter campaigns or were spam since all
these are open to the public all the
comments a lot of people have gone in
and basically gone through and pursed
them and yeah a lot of them are form our
form letters but that that can a form
letter could be a bot going in and
submitting it
what's a form letter it's just it's just
it's the same text oh it's like all of
these submissions have the exact same
text that was written right so yeah form
letter but that could also be people
copying and pasting stuff because some
people like oh I feel this you know I
want to go in submit a comment about net
neutrality but I don't know how to
present myself exactly well here's the
you know the kind of umbrella
determinate term I want you to use and
that kind of thing sure so um but
there's an analysis at least the Ars
Technica references that was sourced by
a specific internet service providers
and that found that 98.5 percent of the
unique comments when you take out any of
the form letter ones 98.5
percent of them support existing net
neutrality rules so it's very
overwhelming and we've been fairly
obvious with how we stand on that
subject but you know at the end of the
day the FCC Ajit PI is going to look at
the feedback and then they're gonna say
based on this feedback we have decided
to do this and it's not really something
that people go and vote on or that kind
of thing it's going to be their decision
how people respond to what they decide
to do is going to be significant and
it's also going to be significant if if
really ninety-eight percent of people
say we want net neutrality to be
protected and they still don't change it
then you know that's a big deal my
people will hopefully be right but it'll
be riots in the streets yeah but again
there's no limit of things to be pissed
off about these days so let's move up
and get back to tech HP Envy the HP Envy
x-360 even more specifically the HP Envy
x-360 15 - BQ 1:01 na is officially the
first notebook with a Zen apu we've been
interested in Zen ApS a the official
integration of Zen architecture as has
been featured in Rison CPUs and Federer
for CPUs actually integrated with Vega
GPU architecture and the one being used
in this specific notebook by HP is the
risin 5 2500 you it's a quad core with 2
gigahertz base frequency up to 3
gigahertz first frequency I notice
they're calling that first frequency or
not music or to me that says burst
frequency we breed for brief periods of
time if you're doing it for too long
then it's gonna generate too much heat
so right but still you know I'll be
interested to see how that actually
performs the envy x-360 also has a
single stack of eight gig
ddr4 2400 ram certain 56 gig nvme SSD
and a full HD touch enabled display the
graphics chip that is integrated the
graphics chip has been confirmed to be
integrated as part of the APU HP has
confirmed that its features Vega mobile
so they are making a vague a mobile
possibly Vega eight series or Vega 10
series according to the article and the
power consumption of this full system
should not exceed 45 watts
so that's you know I guess you could
maybe assume then that there might be an
APU in this series that has a 45 watt
TDP or less mmm if that's the entire
system we're also not totally sure at
this point if there's gonna be you know
if there's gonna be desktop AP use it
slot into a and for that are kind of
akin to the ones that are actually you
know BGA made for mobile or if there's
gonna be crossovers and those lineups
are if they're gonna make it it's a
completely separate lineup for the
desktop ap use we shall see but we know
they're making that stuff might be used
because ever since risin seven first
launched back at the beginning of the
turns beanie this year they've had and
four motherboards with video outs on
them so yeah yeah finally finally gets
used the amp or video that's not too up
there still virgins not too uh is
recognizing that people don't like the
color of their existing fans you don't
say the color of their existing fans
which I have dubbed as dried blood and
putty is what I call it you right that's
least appetizing description yeah for
the least appetizing color but
fortunately Noctua is now they're
expanding their lineup with chrome
expands crow max that's a hazing not
just fans but also cables and covers for
some of their heat sinks this is all
lies oh okay so there's a Tom's Hardware
article that has a few pictures and
whatnot pop-up video a music video
there's also this little guy which is
but they already have black fans this is
a 30 already has black fans they do the
industrial series but these these are
these are fancy fancier Micromax line
they are basically reproductions of
their like nff 12 and they're popular
fans in this color but also with color
accents and swappable corner pieces neck
okay so they're hopping on the trendy
bandwagon they are they have these
little 30 centimeter color matched
extent
my cables so you get some color accents
in your Y cables these little guys that
pop on there they're aluminum they're
available in black and whites they're
made so that you of course could just
use them in black and white or you can
paint them probably the white would be
easier to paint them black I would guess
depending on what color you're going for
and then they have a variety of inserts
so this one has a red insert that you
can see right there this is just an
example of their fans 120 millimeter and
140 millimeter sizes 12 volt a series
PWM fans 94 CFM airflow for the 120 140
CFM CFM airflow for the 140 and there's
the entire line up of the cover what
cooler does that good that cover so the
different colors that will fit on the
Nhu 12s the NHD 15 and the NHD 15s ok
their most popular the fans are the
black swap fans they come with swappable
anti-vibration pads available in red
blue green yellow white and black yay
that's a pretty wide wide range of
included accessories yeah usually I
think it's already sold individually and
stuff but yeah you know like an FF 12 is
still gonna cost it 23 bucks a 15 a 14
still 25 27 so you know there's still
expensive fans but earning Tanakh - I
saw them specifically reply to a tweet
they're the exact same they they don't
function any less different or anything
like that right even according to the
article and actually there's enough to a
page on this to even according to the
article these aluminum covers that
they're putting on the heatsinks
themselves make it better what did the
cooling why it also helps direct airflow
through the coolers aluminum fins
allowing the cooler to dissipate heat in
a more efficient manner I don't know
that's marketing be Esther or what
gamers Nexus will probably test it I'm
not exactly sure how that works I don't
know yeah I mean it's just I don't know
it just contains the air path
more stuff like you don't have the gap
you sing on the sides of the aluminum
fins right it's like doesn't make much
of a difference cool
marketing marketing not to the fans now
available with color color matchy color
so this is really just an aesthetic or a
cosmetic update to the existing fans
that's existing things yeah but I mean
since it has some of the most
well-respected and functional fans nice
that they can do that too all right
speaking of fans Corsair has also
announced fans goodness who cares about
those crappy Noctua fans with their
solid colors still lack RGB Corsair has
announced their l-louise RGB LED fans oh
yeah these actually look really nice
they actually do look I was gonna buy 12
of these yesterday really but then the
total came out to be like $500
what 412 fans yes the combo I was
getting the combo so three of the 120
millimeter fans that come in a pack with
the lighting node Pro yeah is like a
hundred and twenty dollars a three fan
pack is one hundred and twenty dollars
three fan pack with the lighting node
Pro is awesome it's like 110 120 about
twenty bucks so I added in like two of
those two of those because I needed you
know for I've got like a shit ton of
radiators in the end two elite build
that in planning plus the 140 s I saw on
new egg came in packs of two for like 60
to 65 bucks or something it looks so
good that's why I was like Add to Cart
Add to Cart as much check it by pump the
brakes cow pump the brake you were not
about to spend $500 on fans of course
there probably won't give me any because
I'm building in advance thanks guys
right one hundred and twenty dollars I
wasn't shitting you man any fan threats
pensive they look nice but they're
pricey Wow of course there are the 140s
yeah the one port no oh my god so 144
single that one right there forty bucks
for one bucks a single pack I want to
show their video though cuz
who cares what they look like just look
at the video just look how pretty they
are
yeah so these fans have two sets of LEDs
they've got a ring around the outside
and a ring around the inside 12 RGB LED
loop on the outer edge for RGB LEDs in
the center plug or whatever so as you
can see them demonstrating here bunch of
cool effects of the LEDs chasing you
around one way or the other and it's
tied in with link system and all that
stuff yeah with the lighting node Pro
that's included which does so does
lighting node Pro come even if you buy a
single fan is that why the single fans
important no I don't think so because
that's lighting no pro right there right
it's just the whole unit that you plug
in it into and then a USB connection to
the motherboard
link and stuff no I think just a single
fan comes with just the fan for 40 bucks
it's pretty crazy so yeah oh look the
fan stop mode capable as well that's
that's useful but yeah available like I
said three by one twenty millimeter kit
if you have spent $120 it's just insane
to buy one forty or individually PWM
fans 60 to 1300 or 1500 rpm depending on
the model that you get and some pretty
cool color effects it's sad because they
look so nice yeah I can't justify
spending that much on family yeah that's
hopefully maybe a little will get a sale
on Black Friday or something like that
yeah usually there's a brand new stuff
they usually start high and they they
usually work in a bit of pricing wiggle
room yeah they can make sales in the
future but yeah we shall see all right
let us move on and to finish off
actually my half of the show with some
donation comments thanks to all you guys
who have donated via the YouTube yes

DJ vision IT $5 Canadian a brewery who
loves you guys and who wants to send you
a bunch of beer won many awards in
Canada how can I get an email contact
please p.m. me I love beer yeah and
Canada ain't bad I've answered beers
even better um
DJ fish and I teeth you do you have a
contact email for for public use I don't
that's why I'm asking Kyle I do not
currently not an active one if you
follow us on Twitter and message us
there just just just tag us both right
that's probably the best way sure yeah I
gotta go figure out the brewery as well
tweet at us yeah I would I would shout
out an email address right now but I do
I do try not to publicize my email
addresses because I hate email and I'm
bad at it yeah me too I'm really bad has
it as it is with the people who I have
actively given my email address yeah so
anyway thank you for the donation dude a
vision and we will were very we're very
happy to follow up on that but we will
try I guess
that's a bad answer all right let's move
on so yeah Robert Dwyer $10 hey guys was
wondering what you guys feel there's
some of the best cases on the market for
airflow what's a tempered glass side
panel I was gonna get the H 500 PV
intellij MERS Nexus kills it that's
gonna say 100 to pick 100 to $200 sure
do do the
do the mesh version of the H 500 P like
they did I just bought it just hack off
of those yet put some mesh on there drop
there times I know the fractal mesh if I
see has gotten free high marks for
actual air flow yeah recently yeah
that's pretty solid mesh and I feel like
a lot of modern cases with just a full
mesh front if you're looking for high
airflow ya are tend to be pretty solid
and drop the degrees that means
important typically the trade-off
between those it's like you know you put
something flat and solid there it's
gonna block some of the sound it's gonna
be quieter yeah might look nicer may be
mesh you're gonna get more sound but
gonna have better air flow so yeah yeah
mesh front case is a pretty good option
and I don't know what besides a mesh if
I that stands out to me with that much
air flow I feel like I I don't see as
many cases as I used to because I keep
telling people not to send me cases I
don't have room right all the cases but
I'm alright I hope that was vaguely
helpful for you Robert
simply aaron 91 $5 help I want to build
replace my PC but whenever I plan a
build something new is always announced
when it's the best time of year to buy
PC parts Aaron I would say no well yeah
right now there's some extraneous things
that are causing it to be crappy in some
areas to buy a PC I did a video on that
earlier today but actually right around
Black Friday timeframe there's a lot of
holiday sales you can get some some good
deals so it's stuff like good time to
shop that just just be aware that
there's some stuff that's kind of
egregiously overpriced and try not to
try to get that stuff their ethics card
and memory um
AMD any AMD graphics cards that are
above 100 ish dollars like your
rx for 80s Rx for 70s and 570s are all
50 bucks plus more expensive than they
should be
5 80s or 100 bucks plus more expensive
than they should be they get 56 and 64
50 to 100 plus bucks more expensive than
they should be you can get
you can get gtx 1060 now for right
around MSRP you're still gonna be paying
like 210 220 for a 3 gig and maybe 260
ish to 70 ish for a 6 gig so that only
sucks because it's like those cards have
been out for over a year now and there's
no price drops in fact this increases
but yeah yeah yeah I hope that sometimes
but yeah it's but it's it's a it's a
it's a thing that you just kind of have
to learn to accept at a certain point is
that you whenever you buy a new PC or
invest in new parts there's gonna be new
better stuff that comes out that's
faster right around this eventually
cheaper it's gonna happen so you just
kind of have to accept that at some
point move on just dive in alright des
Jones $10 oh speaking of which hey guys
I saw Paul's video really about it isn't
good to build the Kami PC right now
should I halt my savings for a starter
for 1920 X and/or 1600 X build possibly
until 2018 or do it before year-end
stuff well des you got it you got to pay
attention to some of the specifics in
that video and the specific things I was
complaining about I didn't really come
back at the end and say there's things
that I shouldn't have complained about
but there are positive things and rise
and launch has been a really good one I
have no problem recommending rise and
CPUs right now there's even some Intel
CPUs that I think makes sense depending
on your budget but yeah if you're
thinking about investing in thread
Ripper or 1600 X haven't have no worries
have no fears they're those those
platforms those CPUs aren't really
affected by those issues I was
discussing in that video your graphics
card choice might be but if you're
thinking of like its gtx 1070 for
example you can get those for 400 bucks
which is again slightly more than the
MSRP heard over at lunch but much more
reasonable than the markups that you got
to pay for the AMD card so there are
options out there for right now just you
gotta gotta kind of watch up for this
waiver that's over wait for like Black
Friday Cyber Monday you'll find some
good deals there a great time to buy a
PC is especially hammer slap five bucks
Paul your review of the msi ge62 Apache
revealed three unadvertised i've got two
slots do any new models have them why
don't reviewers
really check for them I don't know
that's one of the things I really like
to do when I review a notebook I don't
review notebooks that often but I like
to review ones that I can physically
remove and look at the hardware of and
look at upgrading possibilities and
options I hope that was helpful for you
I haven't done an MSI laptop review in a
while though so ya know maybe I should
hit them up for one chair diamond tech
