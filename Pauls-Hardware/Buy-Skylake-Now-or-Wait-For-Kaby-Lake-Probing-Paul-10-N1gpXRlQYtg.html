probing Paul episode number 10
yeah the 10th time I've done this it's
my monthly Q&amp;amp;A session that I do
answering questions from you guys and
all the questions from today are derived
from the comment section from last
month's video probing Paul episode 9
which I did from here and I also
apparently wear the word same shirt that
I'm wearing this time I was in the
Philippines a month before that but um
there we go looking at all of the
historical probing Paul's back through
time but let's get right to it again
starting with questions asked from you
guys this is Alex's question it's not
really question he says he saw the beard
and he automatically clicked like and
there were a few people who who agreed
with him there in case it's not obvious
my beard my beard has been shaved I did
that yesterday I soldiered on with it as
long as I could
i went through november like kind of
that whole process and then i kind of
kept it into december and then i was
just i got too busy to shave it but
honestly it's just as i feel like it's a
little bit too much maintenance for me
it gets itchy and and all that kind of
stuff it's really easier for me to grow
back though so i can't promise that you
know the beard has gone forever it might
come back but we'll see how that plays
out in the future
all right Jake Connor asks how many
monitors is too many monitors a very
good question Jake and you know I will
point out to this picture that was
actually linked by a fellow who
responded to your question on the
comments which is from someone who's
doing day trading like stock trading
with all kinds of monitors it really
depends on what you're doing but I like
three monitors I think and then maybe
adding a fourth if you want to go that
route if you're going to be just gaming
I think focusing on a single really good
monitor for that is a good way to go and
I think 21 by 9 is a great solution for
that so you can even get by with a
single monitor in that situation
especially if you have the ultra wide or
a single 16 by not 9 monitor just as
your central gaming monitor I think
should be your primary focus beyond that
having two monitors is a big step up I
have two monitors and pretty much every
workstation that I do work at here at
home and then if you can add a third and
get three of them then
can get the whole wraparound thing going
and that's really exciting you can just
get so much work done with that kind of
workspace and then I do like the thing
of having the three in the front and
adding that fourth one right up above I
think that's a cool solution as well
beyond that I think you start to get to
the point where you just have too much
going on and it becomes more of a
distraction than then helping you keep
focused or get work done but if the
question is geared mainly towards gaming
definitely just focus on your single
main good monitor first off but don't
throw away your old monitor keep your
old monitor and use it as a second one
because minimum I think two if you want
to get anything done I think is the way
to go that's my advice for that thanks
for the question Jake Judi asks do you
believe SST endurance ratings matter I
was just wondering which SSD would
recommend terms of reliability I have
quite demanding read/write cycles and I
read right about 60 gigabytes per day I
have options such as OCZ vector 480
Samsung 850 Evo 1 terabyte Samsung 850
Pro WD blue OC zvx thank you thank you
that you're enjoying the videos and let
me see if I can help you out with this
question SSD endurance ratings used to
be measured in program erase cycles pe
PE cycles which kind of refers to the
way that data is written to SSDs but
they've kind of updated that and this
they're now they're listing tbw or
terabytes written which is usually
sometimes at least in the case of
samsung's warranties here going to be a
time period or the amount you've written
to the drive so if you really hammer the
drive and they'll take that as your
warranty period versus like 10 years or
something like that that you might get
for an 850 Pro Series that said the pro
series generally do tend to have a
greater and durability more total bytes
Rin as you might see right here the pro
series compared to the Evo series
actually kind of doubles what you get or
at least what they're expecting but
that's what the manufacturer says and
the manufacturer is going to tell you
something
that's like as much as they can promise
while still staying within the realm of
what they think the expected failure
rate will be so what you'll actually
find is that a lot of SSDs can go way
way beyond that
but speaking from a more practical
perspective here Zanon antique article
about this is actually by an aunt
himself Anand I should pronounce his
name correctly
but anyway he is talking about total
bytes written and a bunch of different
factors that go into that there's other
things like write amplification as it's
doing trim cycles and that kind of thing
but he at least put down into a chart
and they said assuming 100 binary
gigabits written GI be how long will
each of these drives last and this is
840 series this is a couple years old
now and even the lowest-performing drive
the 120 gig model they're estimating 4
years of Worth and that's what's like
hammering the drive 100 gigabits binary
gigabits gigabytes written per day is a
lot now you said you're using 60 a day
and I did basic math here to indicate
that if you're writing if you're
actually writing 60 gigs a day that will
be 22 terabytes per year and depending
on what driver using that may or may not
use up that cycle be absolute but to be
more realistic I are somewhat more
realistic I'll also direct you guys to
this article on tech report it's again a
couple years old but I think it's still
very valid and this is linked in the
description this is by Jeff and he did
like an endurance test with a bunch of
different SSDs talks about how they die
and why they die and NAND running out
and all that kind of stuff but basically
after several months of testing I
believe it took several months for it to
go through they finally all died but
they took a long time several of the
drives got to 600 700 or 800 terabytes
written before they actually kicked the
bucket
the courser Neutron GTX got over a
petabyte 1.1 to 1.2 petabytes written
the longest-lasting drives in the tests
where the HyperX drives as well as an a
40 Pro I believe the HyperX drives went
over to petabytes and the 840 pro I
think went to 2.2 or 2.4 but um I mean
this is a little bit anecdotal because
they were using the he just use single
drives for all those tests but more to
the point is that what these drives did
before they failed was they started
throwing smart errors so that can give
you some indication that a drive is
about to die and most of them didn't
just die and stop working and even if
you do get through all of the program
erase cycles that an and chip is capable
of doing most good drives will actually
enter as a state called steady state
rather than I guess solid state steady
state just means you can't write to the
cells anymore but you can still read
from them so even if the drive did
freeze up entirely as far as being not
writable to anymore you should still be
able to get the information off that
drive that is of course unless your
flash controller dies but flash
controller really has nothing to do with
durability and that's something that
hasn't been quite as big of a problem I
think since those older SandForce
controllers got off the market okay I
hope that is a pretty that's that's a
pretty thorough answer to your question
and the hope that gave you some good
info anyway major McLaren asks is it
worth buying a laptop with the new 10
series graphics card I would say yes for
a few reasons one they're full sized GPU
so if you get a 1060 1070 or 1080 from
Nvidia in a laptop it's the full version
of the chip and two would be that the
best competitors I feel like for those
GPUs the discrete mobile GPUs
from AMD side aren't going to be
available for a while what they're
talking about right now with Vega and
the GPUs based on Vega probably are
going to be out in the laptop form via
ap use that use n and Vega in the same
chip
probably not till the second half of
next year so you still have a while now
where I think the 10 series GPUs from
Nvidia are going to be kind of the best
gaming performance you can get in a
mobile version and a laptop now again
they're they're full size GPUs but
they're still in a laptop form factor so
often they they're down clocked a little
bit some of the specs are very very
slightly different but I did just get a
razor blade 16 that I'm working on a
video review for that has a 1060 in it
and I think I think they work really
well
they're very power efficient too so
great solutions if you really need a
gaming laptop to take on the go alright
Jason asks I was going to buy a new CPU
for Christmas - 6600 K or 67 ok then I
heard the new KB Lake CPUs are coming
out should I wait for the new generation
of processors or just bite the bullet
and get skylake instead now you ask this
question I don't know three three to
four weeks ago when there was not as
much information out as there is now now
there's certain things I can't really
talk about because there are ndas coming
up that
I am restrained by butts lots of news
lots of leaks and certain stuff coming
out especially on the AMD side and they
just basically have told everyone
there's n CPUs we'll be out in the first
quarter first quarter could mean January
to March so it's like a good three three
and a half month time range that you'd
be waiting for you're talking about
skylake processors KB Lake is also
supposed to come out again rumored at
the beginning of 2016 and we don't know
exactly when that might be again could
be January it could be later than that
but yeah the thing you're looking at
right now though at least is the tail
end of like the holiday sales happening
so if you can get a good deal on a 6600
K or 6700 K I'd say it'd be worth buying
especially if you don't think you can
wait two months one month two month
three months to get yourself a system up
and running that said if you have a
system right now that's functional
that's getting you by I think it's worth
it to wait because you'll have cable a
cop shion's which will give you more
options you might have some price drops
on some of the other stuff you never
know you might see skylight drop a
little bit and then if Zen really comes
out and does do what is expected then
you might see some price shuffling as
well on the CPU side so I think that
assesses it there that that yeah that's
what I think about that Juan asks hey
Paul what brand of 2.5 inch SSD would
you recommend for the average consumer
for your average consumer still being
reliable they're way way too many
options to choose from
I agree one and there are lots of
options because there's lots of
companies that you haven't heard of
before that can purchase some man to get
a controller and cobble together
products without too much effort that
said I like to stick with reputable
brands and I think you should too
the cool thing at least if you're
looking at 2.5 inch SSDs is since
they've been out for a while and since
SATA kind of really they topped out
what's what the SATA bus could could
handle like two years ago you have lots
of really comparable performance SSDs at
the top of the range that are still
quite affordable so all that said
obviously you want to take a close look
at what price you're paying and then I
would say just go with a reputable
manufacturer and my list starts with
Samsung and Intel also crucial SanDisk
Kingston ADATA Corsair Patriot Myshkin
Plextor and OCC all brands that I would
have no problem purchasing an SSD from
then just look for a good cost per
gigabyte and then make sure that the
performance numbers that are listed are
there and of course double check your
reviews too and see what kind of
experience people are having with them
you want 450 to 550 megabytes per second
reads and rates and most SSDs can hit 90
to 95 percent of what the fastest SSDs
and the range can cost of course if
you're looking for really good endurance
like I was already talking earlier maybe
go with the pro model like an 850 Pro
but by and large you can get again 90 to
95% of the performance of the top-end
2.5 inch SSDs I mean even if you're
buying the slightly more budget models a
data SP 550 is one that I have worked
with before good performance in a really
good price and now you hear that train
rolled by which means I should probably
cut this off and start working on my
next video so stay tuned for that hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoy it and
of course leave me comments in the
comment section because I will be coming
back and answering those next months in
probing paul number 11 the first one for
2017 and maybe i'll even respond to a
few of you who asked me to play a song
on the ukulele ukulele I was I was
considering doing that but um and my
voice is I don't know my voice is anyway
thanks for watching guys we'll see you
