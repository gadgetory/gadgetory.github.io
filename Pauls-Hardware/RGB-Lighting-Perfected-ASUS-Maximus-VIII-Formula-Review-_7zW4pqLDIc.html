ASUS Maximus 8 formula or m8f for short
and as rog motherboards go it sits just
below the Maximus 8 extreme and the Asus
z170 lineup the formula has a lot to
offer though and traditionally it even
gets a feature or two that the extreme
version does not such as a built-in vrm
water block by ek and we can't forget
that sexy RGB lighting support as well
as this is Asus best answer to the
motherboard RGB LED arms race that
kicked off last year with the msi x99s
the m8f might not be the first RGB LED
motherboard but it has a pretty solid
claim to being the first one to get it
right and with the unmistakably badass
rog armor and a laundry list of
additional features you get one of the
best z170 motherboards I've laid eyes on
with the m8 F but it does cost a pretty
penny at $400 MSRP now I'm not usually
one to dwell on packaging but I do think
Asus does a good job with theirs and if
we look at the box we can at least get a
good idea of what they're most proud of
with the MAF first off there's that
cross chill vrm block for the cpu power
delivery is it necessary to water cool
your V RMS no not really but it does
make for a sweet-looking cooling loop if
you're going that route and I think Asus
positions the formula is more of an
ideal water cooling board versus the
extreme which is more for maximum
overclocking and world records that sort
of thing and hey if you're going to set
up a vrm block you can't go wrong having
EK design it it has gianna quarter
threading and yes it will work just fine
air-cooled if you're not setting up a
water cooling loop next is the RGB
lighting which I will come back to later
after I actually set it up also there's
a pretty nice 802 dot eleven AC 2 by 2mu
MIMO capable 867 megabits per second
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth card integrated and
of course the ROG Armour carry over from
the thermal armor that Asus originally
introduced with their tough series the
armour on the front is plastic but there
is nary a glossy section to be found
it looks amazing as you can hopefully
tell and it even serves the practical
purpose of providing some shielding for
the more sensitive surface mounted
components on the motherboard the armour
on the back is a metal piece proudly
emblazoned with the Republic of gamers
logo and it's all done in a very well
matched dark
Finnish specs beyond these I will divide
into two categories there's the standard
stuff for this platform such as the LGA
1151 socket the z170 chipset these
things will pretty much be the same
across most skylake motherboards and
then there's the extra sauce that Asus
is added to make the MAF stand out from
the crowd
standard stuff includes a standard ATX
form factor four dimm slots for dual
channel ddr3 a pretty typical PCI
Express slot layout including two gray
by 16 Gen 3 slots that link directly to
the CPU this is for your single graphics
card up on top or a 2-way SLI or
crossfire configuration if you populate
both in which case both slots will run
it by eight and by eight speed since
there's 16 total PCIe gen3 lanes
available from a skylight CPU also when
I say skylake CPU in this video I'm
pretty much assuming that you're using a
6700 K is there's no sane reason to use
any other skylight CPU with a board of
this caliber and cost also you've got
three total PCI Express Gen 2 by 3 I'm
sorry gen to buy one slots for some
additional expansion and that lone PCIe
gen3 by 4 slot at the very bottom which
could be used for 3-way crossfire but
should not be because that would be dumb
it is a buy for connection and it's
coming off the chipset that will
introduce some latency and also this buy
fork slot will only run it by 2 speed if
you're using all of your SATA ports
since it shares bandwidth with SATA
ports 5 &amp;amp; 6 more on that when I talk
about storage in just a moment rounding
out the motherboard connections let's
talk fan support which is very good 7
total fan headers on this board all can
be used for 4 pin PWM fan connections
but the two at the top are specifically
for the CPU and then a third one up
there is made for PWM pump connection
which is an awesome awesome feature for
water cooling and if seven headers isn't
enough there's an ext fan header down
here in the bottom right that can
connect up to the Asus fan extension
card which is a cool little piece of
gear and I am actually using it an
arctic Panther built back there but
unfortunately not included in the
accessory so you would have to buy it
separately
there are also three two pin thermal
sensor connections at the top middle and
bottom and you can use those to place
some temperature sensors wherever you
feel that they are needed in your build
along the bottom of the board you've got
front panel connectors a cup
of those aforementioned fan headers a
couple USB 2.0 headers one of them which
will also work with the ROG OC panel
that is also sold separately a USB 3.0
header which is one of two the other is
a right-angle header which is up here by
the 24 pin power the memo ok button can
be very helpful in getting tricky RAM
configurations to boot there's front
panel audio there as well of course and
the super important RGB header that lets
you connect standard 5050 RGB LED strips
12 volts at 2 amps and up to 2 meters in
length if you haven't noticed I've kind
of transitioned into talking about
special asus rog features but never mind
let's go over storage the single m2 slot
on the MAF is kind of hidden it's behind
this plastic panel down here at the
bottom which is nice if you want to hide
an ugly green PCBs SD for example like
this one but kinda sucks if you really
wanted to show off your sexy black PCBs
SD like if you just got a new samsung
950 pro for example it's a key mm2 slot
for SSDs supports data and PCIe as well
as nvme and it supports m2 SSD lengths
from 42 millimeters all the way up to
110 I also notice that while this panel
is off you can get up the motherboard
battery which is kind of nice although
it is hard to say it's this plastic
piece can be removed if you had a long
graphics card installed in the top slot
it is actually pretty important for
water coolers who would not want to
disassemble their entire water cooling
loop or at least remove their GPU if for
example their m2 SSD or their
motherboard battery were to die that
would be a major annoyance anyway there
is a u2 port right here next to the m
dot 2 port which is nice if you have an
Intel 750 series SSD again like I have
an Arctic Panther back there but sadly
this porc shares bandwidth with the M
not - so you cannot run both same time
you get eight total SATA Rev 3 ports the
4 on the left or SATA Express compatible
with that extra little plug in them I
have yet to use data Express for
anything personally but it is a good
means of adding a couple USB 3.1 ports
to the front of your system you would
need that accessory though which again
is not included I'd much rather have
another m2 or UDOT to port them to SATA
Express ports is what I'm really trying
to say here ok these black SATA ports
are controlled by an add-on as media
chip and then the final two gray
rightmost ports are natively controlled
by the z170 chipset but using them limit
that by 4 piece
a lot at the bottom two by two speeds
these storage options will be more than
enough for most people but for a $400
board my biggest letdown is that you
can't raid up a couple m2 Samsung 950
pros or something like that for an
insanely fast storage configuration I
mean yes you could get an end a PCIe to
MDOT to riser card and put it maybe in
the last PCIe buy 4 slot or the second
one if you're not running an SLI
configuration but it's just a much less
elegant solution in my opinion and it
would limit the speed of that drive if
you filled out all your SATA ports and
you had it plugged into that bottom most
by four slots also that riser card again
is not included in the accessory kit so
you wouldn't need to purchase that
separately ok moving up the right side
of the board we have a 24-pin main power
connection there's post LEDs that are
right next set as well those will light
up as your system powers on so if it
hangs you can easily look at the LED
that's lit up and that will easily let
you determine the culprit of your post
issues above that there's a fun
interactive area with power and reset
buttons as well as the Asus Q code LED
that's for debugging more confusing post
issues
there is also an ln2 header up here
although it's under the shroud that is
for circumventing the cold boot bug for
exotic cooling gurus and shouldn't be an
issue that it's underneath the Shred
because if you're doing ln2 cooling
you're probably to remove that whole
shroud anyway ok what am I forgetting
there is an a pin CPU power connector up
here if you juice to the high end power
delivery components for the CPU that
includes japanese-made 10k black metal
caps next FET MOSFETs and micro-fine
alloy chokes the audio is top-notch as
well with rog supreme FX 8 channel
support and ESS DAC built in a headphone
amp for up to six hundred ohm impedance
cans nijikawa audio grey caps and the
sonic studio to audio tuning suite to
help you set up for streaming voice chat
and surround sound
ok rear panel IO on the left are a clear
CMOS an USB bio splash back buttons I
love USB BIOS flash back by the way it
lets you update your BIOS without even
having a CPU or memory installed next to
that is connections for you to buy two
Wi-Fi antenna
DisplayPort and HDMI for use with your
skylake CPUs integrated graphics 6 USB
3.0 ports and blue 2 USB 3.1 ports one
type a and one
type-c a ps2 combo port for those old
peripherals you just can't seem to let
go of an rj45 port for the Intel I - 1 9
- be wired Nick and gold-plated audio
connections for mic in 8 channel
surround out or the option of an optical
Toslink s/pdif connection despite all of
the words that I've just said I have
still skipped some stuff with this board
like that you can use Network multi gate
teaming for your wired connection as
well as both wireless channels to
maximize your bandwidth or the key bot
to feature that lets you use your
keyboard shortcuts on your keyboard to
do motherboard e things like a quick
overclock powering on enabling XMP or
clearing your CMOS there's a link to the
Asus page on the Maximus 8 formula it's
in the description below if you want to
double check it for other things that I
might have missed but for now I just
need to move on and set this board up
for some testing I will be right back
so I now have my little test bed all set
up and good to go here if you're
wondering what I installed first I did a
6600 K even though I told you guys that
that CPU shouldn't go with this board
but it's my wife's CPU and I'm going to
overclock it and I wanted to see how far
I would overclock so I thought this
would be a good demonstration got a
hyper 212 Evo on top of that
got a couple sticks of corsair ddr4 this
is their low profile series a vengeance
low profile series 2 by 8 gig kit there
i have that Plextor m6e 256 gig SSD that
running off of and then i've also
plugged in this LED strip right here so
that i can demo the RGB LEDs this is
from cable mods so big thank you to them
for sending this over cable mod has
these there they're wide beam LED
technology LEDs this one has foam
adhesive on the back and it's a 60
centimeter strip they also have these
available with magnetic backings on them
so if you have a steel case it I
definitely recommend those because it's
really easy to fidget position them and
whatnot one last thing is that I'm
connecting it up here with this little
adapter piece that came shipped along
with this although it says Asus
compatibility adapter this was shipped
to me along with the LED strip since it
was part of this whole demonstration
thing but you might want to make sure
you get a hold of one of those if you're
planning on setting this up for yourself
I want to demonstrate a few features of
this motherboard this is definitely not
exhaustive by any stretch but they are
features that I particularly find to be
useful so the first one is going to be 5
way optimization so in order to get at
this basically you need to get into
Windows get all your drivers and
everything updated and then you want to
install the Asus AI suite 3 from the ACS
AI suite 3 you'll have the option to
click the 5 way optimization button what
this is going to do is do an automatic
process with your system it will reboot
it a few times it will first
automatically overclock your processor
which is well in my opinion the most
useful thing it'll also go through a
couple more energy well it'll it'll
optimize your power delivery your
digital power delivery it will optimize
your power savings features with EPU it
will run through fan expert 3 which will
reach out to all the fans connected to
the system and tune them to the proper
speeds I only have one fans so I kind of
skipped that and then lastly there's
also a thing that will go in and adjust
your audio and your networking
which also I'm not going to dwell too
much I'm mainly focusing on overclock
here because I have the 6600 K and after
running through all the procedures it
does automatic burn in tests like a
quick burnin test on the CPU and this
got me all the way up to 4.7 gigahertz
with this processor so that's basically
it in a multiplier overclocked to 47
it's about a 91% increase in CPU speed
as you can see here and that's it's a
pretty nice overclock even the voltage
wasn't too bad it's idling right now but
it's only hitting about one point three
five to one point three six max which is
well within range and I'm I'm pretty
happy with that and I'm also very happy
that the 6600 K was able to overclock so
well
I have not restarted and I am in the
BIOS or UEFI and let me hide myself so
you guys can see what's going on here
just going to do another quick rundown
of some of the features in the BIOS that
I like because Asus gets a lot of
positive feedback about it they put a
lot of effort into it and right now
we're looking at easy mode which it will
boot into by default so here's where you
can get kind of a quick look at your CPU
that's installed the BIOS version what
Rams
what Ram dims you have installed you get
a CPU temperature histogram right here
which is nice as well as some easy
system tuning ability enough functions
here you can switch between quiet
performance and energy saving macro mess
with those easily mess with your boot
manager by dragging and dropping which
is also handy did I mention the mouse
totally works here you can also do XMP
profile or you can look at the fans that
you have connected including a call out
there for that water pump header turn
irst on or off that's helpful as well
and there's other cool things you know
like you can quickly access the boot
menu with f8 I'm going to switch over to
advanced mode by hitting f7 over here is
the extreme Tweaker area and here's
where we can see a lot of the
overclocking stuff done by the 5 way
optimization which was communicated over
to the efi UEFI and is now engaged over
here scrolling down you can see just so
many different functions and things you
can mess around with the extreme Tweaker
tweakers paradise allows you to get even
more in-depth stuff like f CL k and b CL
k messing around anyway though I'm not
going to go into all that because I
don't even understand
what half of it does advanced monitor
you can monitor stuff like your
temperatures and whatnot that's always
useful
here's your boot area where you can be
boot things you can also like flash
directly from the BIOS with the easy
flash and all that good stuff a lot of
this has been around before anyway going
back over to Maine wait no not Maine
let's go back here to extremes weaker
you might notice one other thing that I
like here is that when you are selecting
any of these different things that you
can change it will give you a little bit
of information down here at the bottom
like select around operating frequency
so for certain functions that you might
be more confused about what they do I
find those little tips to be extremely
helpful you also might notice that you
can tap f3 on any particular thing that
you're about that you've selected and
that will add it to this tab over here
which is my favorites and my favorites
you can pretty much set up however you
want so you know if you're going back
into the UEFI over and over again to do
a bunch of overclocking or something
like that you can do all of the settings
right here so that they're quick quickly
and easily accessible and you can go
ahead with whatever you might be doing
for your overclock very very handy you
even have a quick note function over
here just have a note pad thing and do
stuff and then lastly wait what was I
going to say lastly Oh lastly when you
do hit f10 the other thing I like about
the a spouse is it will tell you all the
changes you've made here when you go to
save and reset I haven't made any
changes but it would list them all so
you'd be like ok here's exactly what
I've done and that is also quite handy
and finally guys I have set up a
demonstration here for the RGB LEDs so
hopefully you can see the lit up points
on the motherboard which should be the
ROG logo down there in the bottom right
the formula logo right there about a CPU
socket and there's also a bit of a extra
lighting right up here by the i/o shield
I've also connected up that cable mod
RGB LED strip which is just sort of
taped to the table right here and I'm
going to run through the aura software
which is an independent of AI Suite 3
which you can use to modify stuff so of
course you have static and you can just
take this little color wheel here here
move it around and hit apply right now I
have it sinking so it's sinking the LEDs
on the RGB header as well as the LEDs on
the motherboard so you notice everything
just turned blue
and do like a lighter blue over here or
we can go into the green range over here
or we can go up to yellow or you know
anything that you can kind of find on
this color wheel in between at first I
thought there was no way to just do
white but if you want white you just
click on this little guy over here the
slider the sliders on the right just
account for dimness so you can dim
everything down if you don't want it to
be quite as bright or you can make
everything super breaks like that all
right so I've made everything nice and
orange for the time being of course if
you don't want it just to be static you
can apply a breathing effect which will
cause it to slowly fade in or out can't
modify the breeding affect breathing
effect so what you see right now is what
you get for whatever color you might do
you have a strobing effect which I hate
I don't know what I mean I guess it's
another effect you can do but strobing
just turns everything on and off that's
super fun you can also choose color
cycle which will cycle through colors so
if you or once that RGB Ness going on
then you can do that there's also a
music effects ability which I do have
some footage of although I'm not playing
any music right now so it won't do
anything but this will basically take
your system audio and basically do some
crazy effects with the RGB s4 that also
this last one is CPU temperature which I
thought was kind of interesting it will
basically take your CPU temperature take
a reading of your CPU temperature which
right now is off a parent note does your
CPU temperature and then it changes the
the color so from green right now which
is where it's at since it's idling then
just put under load it'll turn yellow
orange and red which I thought was also
kind of neat anyway I'm gonna unsink
these right now and let's put this back
to just static for the main the main
color on the motherboard and then let's
go down to the header so you notice you
can control the RGB LEDs on the
motherboard or you can control just the
RGB LEDs on the header this little
button right here although it's not
labeled you can click and it will pull
up a little calibration tool so you can
hit next it'll light up your strip and
you just tell it what color you're
seeing so that's red that's blue and not
green so Tillet that's blue and then
that's green and that will do some basic
calibration which I thought was useful
since there are multiple types of RGB
LED strips out there and then of course
if you just want to independently
control the RGB strip by itself you can
do that here with all of the same color
and temperature
affects that I showed you just a moment
to go I'm gonna hit sync again and sync
them both up and that pretty much does
it for our demonstration of the RGB LED
options in conclusion the things that I
like about this motherboard are it is
undeniably sexy and attractively
designed I try to be a function over
form person first but I know a lot of
people are going to buy this board just
because of how it looks the LED lighting
is definitely done right it is flexible
there's the expansion available and it's
not muddied by other non changeable
colors on the board I also think that
it's pretty much got everything you can
possibly want in a Z 170 board
especially if you're overclocking in
water cooling with the sole exception of
storage freaks out there who want
multiple m dot two slots with lots of
hard drives attached as for things I
don't like I was initially a little
dismayed that the power and reset LEDs
lit up white and don't change with the
rest of the RGB colors on the board
however you can go into the UEFI and
disable these which is a nice feature
that q code red LED readout does not
turn off though and it would be nice to
be able to do that this is a minor
complaint however I've already mentioned
my disappointment with the m dot 2
support and the storage configuration
but again for most people this won't be
a problem and look to x99 if you really
really want lots of extra storage
peripheral connectivity I also felt that
for the price it would have been nice to
get a high end accessory or two in the
box we don't necessarily need the OC
panel because that's pretty hardcore but
a PCIe m dot two riser card would be
nice or an Asus fan hub maybe finally
for $400 you get a pretty sweet
motherboard but I would be remiss if I
didn't point out that the m8 F is no
faster than any other z170 board out
there that might cost half the price two
hundred bucks or less at least when it
comes to the fundamentals like CPU and
memory speed so this is definitely a
board for enthusiasts with deeper
pockets or those who are willing to take
out a small loan or sell a kidney which
would totally be worth it that is all
for this review though if you enjoyed it
don't forget to hit that like button and
also you can use my amazon link which is
