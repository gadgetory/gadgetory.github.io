to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and thermaltake hey guys how's it
goin and welcome to my coverage of
Computex 2018 here from Taipei Taiwan
we're getting things started a little
bit early
over at NZXT we're at the Hyatts and
they lane it led us into their Suites
even though Computex hasn't actually
officially started yet they brought us
in and they showed us some really
awesome stuff and then they told us that
we couldn't tell anyone about it so stay
tuned for cool stuff from NZXT in the
future but that's really like all I can
tell you for now what I'm gonna give you
guys is a once-over of this new case
this is the H 500 actually the H 500 I
it's available as a I for about $100 or
the H 500 which doesn't include the
intelligent controller and that's only
gonna be $70 this is the replacement to
the s 340 which is NZXT s insanely
popular case I've used it in builds
before and I think they've done some
really good work improving it adding
some more features to it and also
slightly changing the design while
maintaining a lot of their same
aesthetic from before but updating it to
make it a bit cleaner now of course
you're gonna have tempered glass on the
outside of this actually have that piece
right here I like what they've done with
this because they put a metal bracket
across the top so you can actually
remove it with a single thumb screw at
the back it pops out and it's got a
couple plugs that stick in there to keep
it securely in place that's another
thing about this case is that the entire
front piece actually here from the top
to the front is a solid piece so you can
no longer just grab the bottom and pop
this front part off but they have added
a bit of space here in front of where
your fans or potentially a radiator go
for the front intake so you do have
actual space for air flow to get in
there at the front here there's a small
dust filter just across the bottom and
you can pop that off if you remove the
opposite side panel so easy way to clean
the dust up that might collect in there
since that's where the majority of the
air flow is going to come as well as the
rear side in the back there's actually
ventilation down the entire thing and
there's also a removable dust filter
right there you can remove that dust
filter if you need to clean the dust or
you can just remove the entire side
panel and clean it out that way for
front panel connectors that keeping
things basic with the power reset and a
couple USB 3.0 ports maybe I can't
convince them to make a like an elite
version of this that has a USB type-c
port I don't know
I just do that that's probably a lie
right they can that neither confirm nor
deny the existence of that you're on the
inside we have a couple SSD trays I just
have a little thing on the side that you
can pop in remove those since this is a
grid here you can actually reposition
those if you want to - if you have one
SSD and you don't want it to seem lonely
with an empty second bracket or you can
pop these off flip it around to the back
and there's a couple SSD mounts on the
back of the motherboard tray so pop
those in there and put your SSD wherever
you want the SSD to be if it's pretty
SSD or if it's an ugly SSD everyone's
going from should be obvious for
included fans we have 220 millimeters
they're both set up for exhaust by
default but of course you can reposition
them if you want to 120 at the top and
120 at the back speaking of the back if
you spring for the H 500 aversion you
will get a vertical GPU mount right here
if you get the standard H 500 you won't
get that but it is compatible so you
could add that in the future if you want
of course your airflow is going to
suffer just a little bit there actually
Dimitri was here what written we arrived
he actually de flowered this case and
did the peel right in front of my eyes I
couldn't believe it I just but you know
Dimitri he's he's all about that peel
but it is a great feature if you're
gonna plan to do water cooling in this
case because water cooling what they
vertical mount looks really pretty
especially we have a block that has a
can see the fluid inside it's a good
thing to do opposite side panel removes
with just a couple thumb screws pretty
standard here at the back is what makes
this the iverson which is this NZXT
control hub you can connect three fans
to this as well as one LED Channel and
of course you can daisy chain more LED
strips off of that if you so desire and
then NZXT has an entire eco system that
works with their cam software if you
want to add additional control devices I
did a build in the H 200 I a few months
back where I dopant to that and I didn't
have the most easy time with that
because when you're trying to in to
involve so many different LED devices in
a case there's a lot of wiring involved
but NZXT is working on some new stuff to
help out with that again I can't give
you guys many details about that but in
the future they're continuing to evolve
this ecosystem and make things better
one thing I really like about the design
for these new H series cases is the
cable routing channeling that they have
going on here across the top a little
bit here on the side and also for this
case again for the eye version they've
actually added an LED strip that's just
behind the NZ
T crossbar here in the middle and that
will give a glow right there and I'm
told it looks really cool but maybe in
the future I'll do building this and can
actually show you how it looks down in
the basement you have plenty of room for
your power supply and there's also a to
drive hard drive cage or a 3.5 inch
drive cage here and you can also
reposition that so give yourself a
little bit extra room room if you want
to put a pump down there or you know
stuffed animals or any anything else you
might want to fit in the basement
something you want to hide but also make
functional finally as every case should
have power supply filters down in there
at the bottom
the s340 had that too so that's kind of
an expectation but just wanted to also
show you guys that it's there this case
is available right now so go ahead and
buy one if you're interested again just
$70 for the standard version $100 for
the H 500 eversion with the intelligent
controller and the LED strips a nice
upgrade if you go for that but that's
all for my coverage here at the NZXT
suite at Computex I want to say a big
thank you to my sponsors of course
Thermaltake Coolermaster gigabyte and
team group and thank you guys so much
for watching this video we'll be back
soon with more coverage and hit the
thumbs up button on your way out
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
