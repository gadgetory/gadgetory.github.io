is my testing video for this tiny little
two thousand dollar ish system that I
built in the doctor's Abers sentry 2.0
all covered in my build video so check
that out if you missed it this is part
of my monthly builds series at the
beginning of every month I put out some
builds then I build one of them and then
I test one later on in the month so I
have some specific goals here with this
build and that is to see how hot the CPU
gets see how hot the GPU gets because I
think that's going to be the major point
of contention since we really have a
very limited amount of space to work
with here when it comes to cooling
performance and when I parted out the
system actually chose to go with the
harder option when it comes to CPU
cooling by going with an all-in-one
liquid CPU cooler the Corsair h-60 here
was that the right call or would it have
been simpler and even a better choice to
have just gone with a low-profile air
cooler like the cryo rig c7 here that
would give me a lot more space in the
graphics card side since I wouldn't have
this 120 millimeter radiator to mount so
that would also mean that I could
possibly upgrade my GPU from this 2070
to maybe something like a 20 80 TI but
which is the better choice cooler
masters SK series mechanical keyboards
help you keep a low profile with ultra
flat double Schottky caps and a slim
minimalist design available in full size
trim as the SK 650 or the even more
portable 10 keyless sk 630 these
keyboards feel great thanks to genuine
Cherry MX low profile mechanical
switches they've also got a durable
brushed aluminum top plate and a
detachable and braided USB type-c cable
so click the sponsor link in the
description for more on the cooler
master SK 630 and SK 650 so for testing
the system we really need to answer two
questions one is how hot is it going to
get and two is is it going to be able to
maintain clock speeds both from the CPU
and the GPU when it starts to get warm
because of course heat dissipation with
the case of small is going to be our
biggest concern so I have three tests
that I'm gonna run one is a CPU stress
test with I 264 one is a GPU stress test
with MSI combustor and the third is a
more practical real-world test where
we're gonna be gaming with Apex legends
as well as streaming on the system at
the same time and when I say streaming I
mean we're gonna be using OBS to take
what's on screen Riaan code it at a
lower resolution and we're actually
gonna be capturing that straight to the
system rather than actually live
streaming but when it comes to the CPU
performance it's effectively the same
thing so I first ran the
with the system pretty much running its
talk out-of-the-box I didn't do any
tweaks to it at all so for that we were
hitting mid to high 70s on the CPU
during the I 264 stress test we did hit
a DC on one CPU core but that's within
range we were at 4.3 gigahertz on all
cores all six cores on the 8700 K I did
dip down to 4.2 gigahertz we were at 4.7
gigahertz max on a single core when I
switched over to the msi combustor test
for the GPU I was running in at 1080p in
windowed mode after about 10 minutes it
hit 69 degrees Celsius max on the GPU
and that was just the fan running at
about 2100 rpm which is about 70 percent
fan speed GPU clock actually throttled
down to 1440 megahertz but it is common
with a stress test like combustor for
the GPU frequency to dip it maxed at
eighteen seventy-five megahertz and
those were my numbers for the initial
testing setup I want to point out that
the CPU fan or the fan on the radiator
here is running at a fixed 4,000 rpms
for pretty much all of my tests I kept
at that speed to maintain consistency
across all my tests and definitely not
because the asus motherboard was acting
weird and wouldn't adjust the fan speed
no matter how hard I tried but from
there I moved to overclocking because
why bother putting an all-in-one liquid
cooler and getting a z3 90 motherboard
and a case cube processor if you're not
going to overclock it at all the answer
would be case q processors do run a
little bit higher frequency out of the
box than non case Q processors but point
is I wanted to try overclocking so I
tried a moonshot first of all and just
did the 5 gigahertz preset and the
motherboards BIOS short answer is that
didn't work we hit thermal throttling
pretty quickly hit over 100 C on CPU
temperature and throttled from 5
gigahertz back to 4.4 gigahertz
it was around 4.8 gigahertz from time to
time too but honestly not a
configuration that I could run long term
I tried a 4.9 gigahertz overclock where
I was at 4.9 I'm one or two cores 4.8 on
three five cores and 4.7 on all cores
that seemed like it might work
especially as I started to dial back the
voltage I did a negative 0.125 volts v
core offsets to help curb some of the
heat output which did help some but it
still ended up overheating got up to the
mid-90s Celsius and eventually hit a
blue screen which means you should
restart and try over again so what I
ended up settling on for the CPU
overclock was a four point
seven gigahertz overclock on two cores
4.6 gigahertz on three to five cores and
4.5 gigahertz on all course so 4.5
gigahertz on all cores is what it was
running at most of the time and that's
about a 300 megahertz improvement over
what it was running at at stock which is
better but certainly not the vast
improvement that we often get to
experience when we do aftermarket
cooling but again very very small
form-factor so that is the limitation
we're doing with their run in the i-264
burn test with these settings got me no
throttling after 10 minutes we hit 91
degrees Celsius max on a single core
which is hots but that is with the
stress test vcore was at 1.19 and we
were hitting 70s to 80s see average
temperatures on most course so that is
within reason for a stress test in a
case like this and lastly I did a bit of
an overclock on the graphics card set
the power limit to 114 percent which is
max did plus 200 on the core clock and
plus 300 on the memory and I set the fan
speed to a fixed 70 percent which is
basically the same speed that it was
running out when I did my initial set of
tests so about 2150 rpms for any msi
combustor with this configuration got my
GPU temperatures up to 77 degrees
Celsius max but basically peaked at 76
and the GPU clock speed did improve to
1652 16 80 megahertz overall peaking at
1845 so those initial tests were meant
to sort of get a baseline of what the
system was capable of get a little bit
more performance out of it via some
overclocking and then of course I wanted
to give as real-world of a test as I can
figure out so for that we have this
monitor over here which is 2560 by 1440
and does go up to 144 Hertz so if you
were a gamer and you're investing in a
system similar cost to this you might be
playing at that resolution and with a
high refresh rate 2560 by 1440 monitor
also a good pairing for an hour TX 2070
I might add then another reason why you
might have gone with something like an
8700 K over saying Intel quad core would
be if you wanted to do more with it than
just gaming gaming and streaming at the
same time six core Intel CPUs and they
quarters in particular are very good at
doing that the extra cores and threads
do help out and it is a practical use of
the extra performance that we have
supposedly gotten by going with an
almond liquid cooler and that CPU choice
so for this test this computer is
running Apex Legends on high setting
at 2560 by 1440 at the same time it is
capturing that gameplay footage sampling
it down to 1080 and then storing it on
its local hard drive it's basically the
same function it would be doing as
streaming at the same time it's just
storing locally rather than sending it
over the Internet
outside a second screen connected to the
system that's being captured on a
separate system so we could monitor the
actual performance when it comes to GPU
and CPU temperatures but more
importantly how did the system actually
perform so when it comes to the gameplay
itself we were getting in the low range
70 to 80 frames per second average was
around 100 210 when he was on the ground
looking around or especially inside
buildings we did peak at around 130 ish
fps but we weren't really able to
maintain 144 FPS solid for a monitor
like this that can actually hit that
refresh rate the GPU temperature got to
74 degrees Celsius peak which was pretty
constant and the CPU was in the mid 80s
but on average was actually in the 60 to
70 s Peaks were in the mid 80s
so that was still below throttling range
one thing I would say when it comes to
an all-in-one liquid cooler in a system
like this if you're averaging well above
60 Celsius you might consider not going
with an almond liquid cooler because
almond liquid coolers you want to keep
the actual liquid temperature down if
you're running at a much above 65 C for
an extended period of time
that could actually shorten the life of
your pump so that is something to bear
in mind if I were actually using this
system on a long-term basis I would
probably dial back that overclock a bit
on the CPU just to make sure that my
temperatures were lower than that range
on average on the plus side though the
CPU was able to main 4.5 gigahertz
across all cores without too much issue
and then our GPU is hitting 1800
megahertz pretty consistently as well so
we can see that a stress test like
combustor is going to lower our GPU
frequency kind of automatically whereas
playing an actual game-like API Apex
Legends 1800 megahertz is pretty
reasonable especially for a GPU with a
cooler that is as small as this one so
now we come back to more building which
is always fun this is actually something
I haven't really done when it comes to
my follow up testing videos but I really
wanted to see if I made the right
decision going with this almond liquid
cooler in here so I'm going to take this
apart drop in the 20 80 TI here as well
as the cryo rig
so in my mind I was just gonna be
swapping the CPU cooler and the graphics
card but with a case like this you
really have to take the whole thing
apart in order to get in there to swap
those pieces in unfortunately though
they're all fitting especially this
gigabyte graphics card and since it's a
triple slot cooler with three fans all
the fans are right up against the intake
right here which is nice and then it's
actually got a decent amount of
ventilation at the top for exhaust for
that card - so that actually fits in
there really nicely I'm going to
reconnect this and then we'll get back
into testing so guys we've spent most of
the day testing but we have some good
results to share because this is really
my question is I put together the
initial build and as I compared it to
some of the other builds that went up
because I posted my build about the same
time as quite a few other people like
Kyle ufd tech Linus has done done one
I've seen a few other people out there
as well and the question just kept
coming back to me is it worth losing the
space up here to put that radiator in to
get better cooling for the CPU and
losing the amount of space you get for
putting in a full sized GPU like this
one it's very happy that the gigabyte
r-tx 20 atti overclocked edition was
able to fit in here this is the wind
force version although the fact that the
fans for the card are right up against
the side of the case as well as the fan
on the cravaack c7 cooler on opposite
side also right up against the side of
the case is both a blessing and a curse
it's a blessing in that they're actually
able to pull air from outside of the
case inside which is good since there's
no active fans in the case itself but
it's a curse because it's now sitting
there right next to where you're here
holes are so you're gonna hear any noise
that it makes and while joe was playing
yeah they got pretty loud
before Joe even started game testing I
just did the standard I 264 burn test as
I had done when the all-in-one liquid
cooler was installed with Enoch - a
hundred twenty millimeter fan and to my
surprise no not to my surprise at all
we had throttling within about a minute
and 20 seconds we got over plus 90
degrees Celsius throttling and then
eventually just a minute or two later we
hit a blue screen actually a very
strange blue screen but blue screens can
often be a little weird so my next step
was to reset the CPU to stock speeds in
the UEFI BIOS and I did leave the memory
at its XMP settings so it's still
running at 3200 speed and then I still
got throttling even though the CPU is
just running at 4.3 gigahertz across all
six cores we still had throttling within
a couple of minutes
14% throttling according to I 264 and
the CPU temperatures when it we're in
the mid to high 90s so I only let that
run for about 5 minutes before shutting
it down
so obviously you simply cannot run this
CPU at stock speed under a significant
load if you're going to be using a
cooler that's this small now this is I
264 so it's a synthetic test
it's a burnin test so really nothing's
ever gonna hit your CPU that hard that
it's going to have this effect on it so
you should be able to use this
configuration with the CPU at stock
speeds just bear in mind if you want to
do any heavy lifting with it it's going
to dial back the frequency and keep
itself from overheating next I ran the
msi combustor test on the GPU I did not
overclock the GPU because it's a 28 ETI
that is manufacturer overclocked and
it's a 600 watt power supply so I didn't
want to push the limit there at all plus
it's a 20 atti so it should be able to
handle what I throw at it no problem it
did hit 86 degrees Celsius during the
msi combustor test it ran at 1650
megahertz
initially on the GPU clock but that
dialed back to about 1530 to 1550 and
from there we switched to the final game
test again we use the same setup as
before with Joe playing Apex legends at
2560 by 1440 that was being reencounter
1080 using x264 or on the cpu on the
system and then saved to one of the
extra SSDs on the system at the same
time I had a separate monitor set up
that was being captured by my separate
capture system so we could see what was
going on with temperatures and
frequencies so as expected because we
had that additional CPU load going on
the CPU got pretty hot it actually hit
mid to low 90s 97
c-max was what we saw on a single-core
but it did maintain 4.3 gigahertz across
all cores during the test so I didn't
see any actual throttling happening but
I would expect that to happen if we had
kept playing because we only had about
five to ten minutes of gameplay if you
had an extended session I can easily see
this hitting a hundred degrees CPU
throttling which is going to affect your
gameplay as well as your Game Capture
the GPU clock on the 28 ET I was at
eighteen seventy-five megahertz and the
temperature got up to 81 degrees Celsius
so what it was able to keep itself cool
enough we did have a much better
framerate this time around since again
it is a 2080 TI which is a 1200 ish
dollar graphics card compared to the 27
T which is about 500 bucks but we were
hitting a hundred and forty-four frames
per second by and large and if you
select scenarios like when you're first
diving into the map we did see some
lower frame rate so it dipped down to
110 maybe 120 or 130 from time to time
but most of the time we were actually
hitting 144 frames per second capped so
let's draw some conclusions after all of
this testing and I think the thing that
stood out to me the most was actually
that yes there was some decent benefits
to going within 120 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler even though it
was a pain in the butt to get in there
and even though it greatly limits you on
the length of the graphics card you can
install with a high core count CPU like
a six core or even if you're gonna try
to drop an 8 core in here I think that's
probably the route you should go if CPU
performance is your main concern if it's
not and especially if you're not
considering trying to game and stream on
the system or something you could easily
go with a lower powered CPU a quad core
and they could get by player games you
wouldn't have to worry about CPU
throttling and you would be able to fit
a much larger graphics card in there
also when it comes to noise though even
though again we're just using the single
slim 104 220 millimeter fan to cool the
allman liquid cooler it was much quieter
relatively speaking then the crack c7
and that's simply because the cravaack
c7 had to keep its fan spinning at a
very high rpm and again it's just
positioned right there next to side of
the case so you're gonna hear that noise
when it's generated what I think would
be cool to see although it would require
a mod on a case that already cost 250
dollars would be for someone to mod the
opposite side here to sort of cut out a
gap so you could have air passing all
the way through 420 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler in that case
you can probably also mod it so you
could fit a full size 25 millimeter
on there as well that would probably
give you much better cooling and give
you a better solution if you're trying
to find that balance between like a
really high performing CPU and a pretty
good high performing GPU and still have
it all fit in this very small
form-factor ultimately though I think
this is a niche case I think it's gonna
stay that way it's only going to fit the
needs of a few specific people but I
think for a limited run case that's
actually probably okay in the end though
I think we're all just sort of limited
by the laws of physics and if you're
looking for the perfect trifecta of size
performance and temperature or noise
generation you're gonna have to give up
on one of those corners with a case like
this the size is definitely there but
you're either gonna have to have a low
performing system that you can keep cool
or a high performing system that makes a
lot of noise like this system did when
it was fully kitted out and overclocked
but thank you guys so much for watching
this video I hope you've learned a
little bit more about the doctors aber
sentry 2.0 again I'll post links to all
the parts that I use down in this
video's description hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed it and we'll see
you guys next time
