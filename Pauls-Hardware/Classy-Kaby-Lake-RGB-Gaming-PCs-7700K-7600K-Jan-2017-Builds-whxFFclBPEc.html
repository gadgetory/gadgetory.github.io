Pauls hardware this is my first builds
video of 2017 and if you've never seen
them before essentially every month I do
three videos the first one is a parts
list where I do a couple builds show you
guys the parts talk about my choices and
why I chose this or didn't choose that
or that kind of thing second part is
when I actually build the system third
part is a testing and follow-up and sort
of seeing how the system performs so I'm
actually running a little bit late
already this month because I was at CES
for the first two weeks of January it's
already a couple weeks into January so
check out that playlist if you want to
see any of my CES coverage tons of new
stuff announced but actually not a lot
of it is available quite yet if you want
to see any of the builds I've done
previously such as the thousand dollar
build that I did for December or they
mini ITX builds I did the months before
that or the more budget entry-level
systems that I did the months before
that check out my books playlist and of
course like all of those in this video's
description now the second part of my
builds videos is that I like to have fan
interactions so I actually asked you
guys a series of questions from last
month's so we're going to talk about the
results of that really quick but first
you should already be voting or checking
the vote for next month because February
is coming up soon what bills USD in
February link is in the description for
the straw poll as well you guys get to
vote in let me know what you feel like
seeing hopefully we'll have some Zen
options coming very soon but last month
I asked some different questions and I
typically asked so for example asked
which under represent a case
manufacturer would you like to see in a
future build video this is basically all
the major case manufacturers and a list
apart from Corsair fractal design and
NZXT because I've worked with all of
them pretty recently in the past say the
last few months of 2016
okay fantex was number one on the list I
also have Lian Li kun master be quiet
and when Thermaltake coming in there as
well here's the lesser votes down there
at the bottom but anyway I'm going to
try to work in multiple vendors coming
in very soon we're going to be working
with fantex this month I also asked what
rumor to product launch in early 2017
you're most excited about andy topless
kb lake coming in a second we're gonna
be doing kb lake build today can't do
AMD build yet with Rison because it's
not launched yet
and then of course I also asked what
should be included with the typical
parts list because usually I just do
just the hardware and it seems like most
of you are okay with that 42% a few more
also asked for the PC hardware operating
system and peripherals and I do new
complete builds at times as well but I
will try to point that out you know
pretty clearly at the beginning of the
video either here here's just the
hardware for the core computer or here
is the hardware and monitor and
accessories and of course you're going
to need an operating system if I don't
include Windows just to check out my
windows 10 for $20 video it's now more
like 30 dollars but you can get a
Windows license that's legit and you can
get it fairly inexpensively alright
enough exposition let's dive right into
the first build I have two builds for
today they're both very similar we're
going to start off with an epic RGB
build with KB Lake processor and a GTX
1080 because RGB is everywhere it's
matured a little bit I feel like after
looking at some of the demos they had at
CES and of course cabe you like just
launched and is available and again I'm
not trying to ignore AMD by any stretch
but we can't we can't buy their
processors yet so hopefully Rison will
come soon also bear in mind I'm not
necessarily explicitly recommending KB
like right here if you have a skylight
processor at 6600 ka 6700 K the upgrade
to KB Lake is really not worth it
however if you're buying a new system
right now and you're looking at well
skylight or KB like I'd say just buy KB
like of the 7700 KS and 67 7700 KS and
7600 KS are only about 10 or 20 bucks
more than the skylight counterparts and
for that much difference I would say
just go ahead and get KB like the ship
at higher clock speeds and from
everything I've heard so far you should
be able to overclock a little bit better
with KB Lake than you could with sky
lake that said here's our first build
this is an expensive build $2,700 is the
total price if you buy all these parts
outright but I'm dealing with some parts
that I already have on hands so I can
actually assemble this and I also have a
$700 SSD in there which I'll explain in
just a moment but 7700 K and a GTX 1080
are the core components here let's run
down the one at a time
of course the 7700 K the newest quad
core on this main stream platform from
Intel if you want to get a 6 core or an
8 core processor you got to jump up to
the enthusiast level and that's much
expensive anyway these are selling for
about 350 bucks right now which is thing
could be cheaper but you can you can
find it 6700 K for about three hundred
and thirty dollars again for twenty
bucks I would just get to 7700 K if you
didn't find a deal on a 6700 K though
then go ahead and jump on it they still
overclock quite well and you should be
just fine with that one with a high-end
cooler all-in-one liquid cooler Corsair
h 100 i it's a pretty pretty much a
standard standby been used many times
course there's been continually
improving their design i like the way
this looks and the sleeved cabling on a
tubing and everything it has RGB on the
actual this part of it on the pump block
and you can't control that is the only
part of this build that you're going to
have to control independently or just
turn it off but you can adjust the RGB
lighting on that everything else you
should be able to wire up and control
via the motherboard software and the
Hydra series 8 100 IV 2 costs around
$100 which is a pretty penny to put on
top of the price of your CPU but um the
second version of this bill that I'm
going to do afterwards shows you hacking
you can get everything for a lot cheaper
if you don't need the maximum
performance
speaking of maximum then speaking of
quartz there you have on hands light
notes up in the corner there I have a
Maximus 9 hero already this is a really
nice board
I really like what Asus did with it it
comes in at only about $230 so it is
part of the rog series and even though
this picture looks a little weird and
squish the picture looks looks over on
the left there anyway it's full sized
normal ITX
that's really nice like kind of brushed
metal finishes on the the cooling for
the VRMs and everything it has to RGB
headers one and a lower right and one on
the top right tons of fan headers and
connectivity and it's got a couple of
dot two slots on there and a couple
nights locations and I just I think a
tooth did a really good job with support
and it's even not terribly expensive it
only about 230 dollars so that should
get you everything you need now for the
memory this is a placeholder for now
this is G scale shredder next series at
4 by 8 gig kick so 32 gigs of memory
it's going to populate all the dem slots
and the one I actually chose for the
build here is a sort of a white and
silver finish look out look at these
look at the massive amount of zoom
get there it's white and silver but what
they're actually sending me you can't
buy it which is the RGB version of their
tried NZ's which actually works with the
Asus aura software but that's not going
to be available for sale for a couple
more weeks I'm expecting to get a really
early version of that so I'll be
installing it but for now it's the same
capacity of memory in the same brand and
even the same style with the tried NZ
let's talk about storage ocz I'm working
with for this one so I'm going to be
using the Tryon 150 which is right here
and I actually have no problem
recommending this drive because it's a
very solid very fast not the fastest
SATA drive you can get but they're using
slightly more budget and and on this so
it's a little bit less expensive and for
that reason you can get the forward and
88 version for still 120 dollars and
we're expecting then and prices to go up
right now or sooner they have been
creeping up so still being able to get a
480 gig drive 420 bucks
I think that's a solid Buy and actually
I'm using this in both builds for today
now here's far the most controversial
one but some I'm throwing in here anyway
I keep talking about MDOT 2 and how nice
it is to have a really fast I'm about to
nvme drive so here's the RT 401 terabyte
but it's currently priced at 705 $700
right they so there it is a 1 terabyte
really fast MV ma a drive and man man
you gotta pay for it at this point so
hopefully we're going to see prices on
these come down I'll fully admit this is
not a reasonable part to put in a build
like this which is again why does the
second version version of this build
that's much more reasonable when it
comes to pricing and what goes in there
so 700 bucks for this right now again
it's very expensive but I haven't and I
want to test it and see how fast it is
and how it works but that gives me one
point five terabytes of SSD space in
this build and if you remove that SSD
then the price drops to about $2,000 for
this system instead of 2700 ish dollars
anyway I want it again this to be an RGB
build so for that reason I've gone with
an asus motherboard and an Asus graphics
card now I've seen lots of the different
RGB software's from other word
manufacturers I've worked with a few of
them in the past year they've all been
updated they all have new hardware that
works with them and Asus was one of the
demos I saw at CES that I just thought
like wow they really
I got a little stuff together especially
when you integrate the RGB memory and
you can tie it all together and I like
the different effects you can do they
had an RGB lightning storm effect that I
thought looks pretty cool but of course
the RGB you know everything working
together only really functions if you
have like all the same hardware so a
Sakura is the family of parts in this
graphics card is compatible and a it's
only 650 630 dollars after mail-in
rebate so for a 1080 not terribly
expensive especially for a nice one by
asus and now we have the case this is a
fan text and to evolve this is a glass
one and again going with your
recommendation from fan tech or from
from who i should work with fantex was
recommended i really liked their cases i
have a relationship with them already so
it was very easy to reach out and say
hey i want to check up and to evolve so
they're going to similar these over
they're also sending their fantex RGB
strips that should also integrate with
the asus motherboard so yeah and this
case has been worked with before don't
get me wrong i have seen it and checked
it out kyle has a couple of these now he
has a silver one and the white one i
went with black partially because i
didn't want to use the ones that cal had
already used and also because i asked
you guys on Twitter yesterday so I was
going to if you're going to do an RGB
build would you want the case to be
black and white very very close between
black and white them but I had a little
bit of an edge for black there so that's
what I opted to go with alright lastly
power supply EBG EVGA supernova
I like EVGA power supplies this one's
fully modular so supernova g3 which is
the successor to the g2 and actually
might be building with the g2 but I got
the g3 out now so go ahead and go for it
all black cabling Saltire supplies from
EVGA you know 120 bucks a little bit
more expensive so there is those are all
the parts and again if you were to buy
all this stuff straight up your price
out of the online retailer your purchase
from would be in the $2,700 range
probably closer to 2800 with mail and
rebate now what if you didn't need all
this what if you wanted to build a
gaming PC but you're like I don't need a
7700 K I don't need at any or at least
maybe I maybe I want one but you know
you can get by with a lot less than that
so I was like what if I take this build
try to still stick to a bit of an RGB
theme still thinkin with Kb
like because it's new and everything and
the other new stuff is it out and give
ourselves a more sensible version so
that's build number two here it's a more
sensible build with the same RGB theme a
lot of the same manufacturers I'm
actually using because I tried to stick
with sort of a universal look and feel
throughout but 7600 K instead of a 7700
K gtx 1070 instead of a gtx 1080 and all
around just parts that i found to be a
little bit more sensible when it comes
to do it so 1236 is the price that
you're getting right now on this if you
again were to buy it all from the most
reasonably priced sellers so it's all
hundred to $1,300 depending on whether
you including a windows license and that
sort of thing so again the 7600 K
instead of the 7700 K and you maybe even
could shave another 20 or 30 bucks off
of this if you found a good deal on it
6600 K but again all you're really
missing out there on there is the hyper
threading and depend on what depending
on what game you you play that may or
may not be a good thing for CPU cooler
wants a crier ring look it's got this is
h7 look it's got RGB on the fan sort of
it's black and white so it's going to
blend in and for $35 really good
performance pretty simple to install
will work with the this socket and yeah
35 bucks which is a lot less than what
you pay for the H 100 IV - so the
motherboard here I stuck with Asus once
again because again that are that Ora
software it's pretty good I think I want
to compare this to like mystic lights as
well as I forget what gigabyte is
calling there so maybe do an RGB
software comparison thing soon maybe
sometime but this is the strict z2 7ee
gaming there's actually several Strix z2
70 boards this one's kind of in the
mid-range but it does still come with
your RGB LED headers comes with like the
USB 3.1 front panel header instead it's
very very slightly less less features
and four features I would say that then
you get with the ROG board but still
very solid all all around and it looks
pretty cool not quite as aggressive a
look but again still compatible to Asus
or a software and I think for uz2
somebody needs that would match right in
there for memory I went with the 16 gig
kit instead of 32 because if you're
building a gaming system you probably
don't need 32 gigs
you can get by fine with sixteen I found
this kit for 85 bucks again still with
still g.skill and I've used these
actually this is the same kit that I
have in the Arctic Panther and they are
black you just peel that sticker off and
then you're fine as far as aesthetics go
next steps for the SSD I stuck with the
same one the Oct try and 150 because
again it is a very good price for 480
gig SSD and here I will advise get this
SSD and then find an old mechanical hard
drive that you have say anywhere from
the 500 gig to 2 or 3 terabyte range
most people have something like that
lying around pair that up with the SSD
and then you'll have your fast storage
for your operating system and some games
and you will also have a larger Drive
for for mass storage and backups and
that kind of thing
Asus GeForce GTX 970 aka card this is
again just the same Strix version of
that card that I already showed you just
a 1070 makes it cheaper by 100 and 200
how much cheaper like 200 bucks cheaper
still has the RGB lighting effects still
a very well designed card still gets you
you know 80 to 90 percent of the
performance of the GTX ten eighty
depending again what game you're testing
and then for the case stuck with fantex
here because again they have some nice
RGB features integrated I'm not sure if
this one in particular you can wire up
directly to the asus motherboard or not
but this one does have some RGB lighting
on it it does allow you to control that
directly on the case so you could line
that up with whatever you have going on
internally and a much more reasonable
price this one's about 70 bucks has a
nice side panel window very well
designed case by fan ticks very positive
readings and reviews from what I've read
so far
finally power supply EVGA supernova NEX
oh this is the NEX I was wrong nevermind
and I've just realized that I have the
wrong parts plan here EVGA makes some
solid tyre supplies but don't get the
NEX this is a warning I've recommended
this before I was corrected and I sort
of purged it from from recommending it
anymore
but the NEX is not a good series so
don't get it
get the phone instead this one's semi
modular but it's the 650 gq-- much
better internals and it's much better
raid by the good power supply guys
hooray power supplies I'm like it's even
the same price it's just semi modular
instead of fully modular don't know why
the NEX is even still there but there it
is and sorry if earlier on I had the
wrong link all the links in the
description will be updated with that
power
by rather than the NEX but there is guys
a couple KB Lake builds for you whether
you're looking for something a lot more
blingy and a little bit more powerful in
the $2,000 price range or maybe
something that's a little bit more
reasonable in say the 1213 hundred
dollar price range and of course both of
these bills you could start pulling
stuff out of and replacing with slightly
less expensive parts and get things a
little bit cheaper so I always recommend
if you guys are interested and want to
sort of dive into PC part picker and
like see what you can work out feel free
to leave those suggestions and other
alternative builds in the description
because that's a big reason why I do
this and why I do it every month is
because there's always questions about
what I should choose what's going to
work with what what's going to be more
compatible what's recommended and that's
why I do these videos and of course your
feedback as well whether it's via the
votes in the straw polls or comments and
the videos are always appreciated by me
as well as by other people who are just
learning how to do this whole PC
building thing anyway guys thanks again
for watching I hope you're having a
wonderful 2017 so far I have tons and
tons of videos planned so I'm really
excited about that starting with this
build that I'm going to be doing next
week so stick around hit the subscribe
button and thumbs up button and all that
good stuff and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
