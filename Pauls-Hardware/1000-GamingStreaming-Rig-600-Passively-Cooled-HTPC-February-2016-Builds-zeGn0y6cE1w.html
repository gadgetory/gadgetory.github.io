hardware this is my monthly builds video
for February 2016 the way this works is
that each month I create a couple builds
these are parts lists they're based on
your votes and your feedback and if you
are looking for an actual build this
video does not have it but I did build
that computer behind me just yesterday
and I do have a video coming on that
that was one of my builds for January
now we're doing February build so if you
want to see that build behind me the G
32:58 build that's cost about $400 stay
tuned for that should be up on Saturday
I believe this month based on your
feedback I'm going to be building two
systems and they were based on this
straw poll that I did from last month
which is what PC builds DLC for February
we had four options there and I did
something tricky here I'm actually gonna
do all four of these options but I like
combine them together so we have a PC
streaming and gaming system as option
number one says but I combine that with
the farewell to AMD and three plus
system with an 83 50 because there are
some brand-new 80/50 8350 boards out and
I'm gonna use one of those new ones from
Asus I also have a budget skylake with
LGA 1151 Pentium CPU and that one I
combined with a silently passive silent
passively cooled HTTP C so I have a
budget skylake silent passively cooled
HTPC and that one costs about $600 just
a few notes before I dive into the parts
list here one is that the costs I'm
going to be talking about today are just
for the system itself that doesn't
include monitor or peripherals or like
an operating system unless I say
otherwise also I'm going to be using PC
part picker because I find that it's an
easy place to go and shop and choose
parts for a computer they have
compatible compatibility filters and all
that good stuff and links to these
builds or down in the description below
also there will be a strawpoll link down
in the description where you can vote
for the March builds for next month so
if you guys want to check on the link in
the description there's a strawpoll down
there for voting for March 2016 and I
have five different options on there a
$1500 reasonably epic gaming system so
like epic but you know it's 1,500 it's
not
four grand turned a dog gaming PC like a
$300 not not just like a bare-bones
thing but actually can you game on it
maybe that could be curious
htpc with a cable card for non cord
cutters cuz I have a cable card system
right now an ultra wide gaming build
with a monitor similar to an ultra wide
monitor like the one I have back behind
me here and then the smallest x86
computer you can build which I don't
know that one sounds interesting too
alright guys let's move straight into D
builds themselves we're gonna start off
with the AMD one so this is again a
gaming and streaming system so if you're
gonna be gaming and streaming on the
same system well you need gaming chops
of course but the streaming part can add
fair amount of overhead when it comes to
the CPU depending on how you're
streaming and encoding and all that kind
of stuff but typically CPU in having
more CPU cores for example like the FX
8350 heads since it's an eight core will
help out with that now the FX 8350
depending on the game and the settings
and all that good stuff I'm not going to
get you quite as good gaming performance
especially in the high-end games like
triple-a titles as say the newest Intel
processors but the fact that it is
actually an 8 core processor means that
in certain tasks that use more of the
course it can actually outperform them
I'm not gonna go into any specifics
right now but let's just say that hey
four hundred and fifty two hundred and
seventy dollars depending where you buy
it what are we're seeing here a hundred
and sixty-five is the lowest price on a
PC part picture right now but you can
get this and it's a eight core and you
can overclock it and all that good stuff
- for a cooler I went with the inner max
this is one I've used several times
before it is 45 at Newegg but on the you
can use a 15% off promo code nice thing
is PC part picker will often put those
in there so the promo codes in there and
you can get it for like eight ten
dollars more than you would pay for like
a hyper 212 and I think it happens to
look a lot nicer since it's all black
and that kind of stuff it's a good
cooler to so give you a little bit of
overclocking Headroom and way better
than the stock AMD cooler ok next up is
the motherboard and this one I had to
punch in manually because it's not
currently listed on PC part picker cuz
this is a brand new motherboard a brand
new m3 + motherboard I didn't think
we're
gonna see any more of these since a m4
is still like it's supposed to be coming
I don't know soon a few months maybe but
all the motherboard manufacturers have
kind of done this last like little slew
of am3+ motherboards and they have some
cool features for one I mean they look
kind of fancier and this one has like
the aura lighting effects and all that
good stuff
but I think one of the nice features on
this one which hopefully I can get a
good picture of some here somewhere here
no maybe not let's just do this look
look down there at the bottom that is a
yeah that's an MDOT two slot yeah and
the bottom right there this one's also
got nvme support so faster support for
faster drives and all that kind of stuff
other than that just you know it's very
gamer II of course but it's pretty nice
board all around and it's a 970 chipset
but AMD has released some of the
restrictions on that so you can still
even do like crossfire and SLI support
if you're talking about 2 card
configurations so that's pretty nice for
memory I just went with a team dark 16
gig 2x8 kit I wanted 16 gigs for this
cuz you want a little bit more than that
if you're talking like you know
streaming and gaming at the same time 8
gigs I think it's kind of the minimum
for gaming and I'm actually leaning
towards recommend 16 these days but 16
should be fine and at 1600 speed and
whenever I'm looking for memory I just I
used the drill-down thing on PC part
picker and I just find like the cheapest
memory that matches the the capacity and
speed that I want and then I just find
something that hopefully looks a decent
these have kind of silly heat spreaders
on them I don't know they're not that
bad at the top but I'm you know it'll
work for an SSD once again we've gone
with 88 a premiere SP 550 240 gig SSD
cuz I feel like a 240 gig SSD is really
nice price point right now for the
capacity you get in the speed and I've
used this several times and that is
because whenever I'm shopping for an SSD
on PC part picker I tend to go in here
and I use these filters so I want to
show you and I want to do a little bit
more focus on choosing the parts this
time around and sort of how I do it
because sometimes I just say here's the
parts I picked but when I'm choosing
apart like an SSD I'm like all right I
want a 240 gig SSD so I use these little
capacity sliders over here to narrow it
down to between 220 and 300s SD checkbox
right
then you can narrow down other things
book interface and form factor and all
that stuff but all I really care about
is I want a 240 256 gig SSD and how
cheap can I get 160 dollars is the
answer right now which is a good price
in my opinion for a 240 gig and then of
these that are all 60 bucks right now
the a data is just one that I've worked
with before and I know it's pretty solid
PNY you know is fine as well you got a
team one you got silicon power I guess
and then if you go more expensive you
know obviously there's other options but
you know what for our money chances are
we're not going to see a huge difference
going with the slightly better say to
read three six gigabit per second SSDs I
wanted to drop some mass storage in
there too so we got a Hitachi 2 terabyte
hard drive 60 bucks pretty good hard
drive should be pretty reliable for you
and then gets a lots of mass storage for
a video card I just decided on on gtx
970 and i didn't want to go into the
whole like which video card to choose
and all the team red and team green
green options swap this up for something
else if you don't like the 970 I just
think this one in particular is a pretty
good price point it's about 310 on
Amazon for EVGA s and this is the super
clock version I have used this one
specifically it's got a nice you know
it's got a pretty decent little little
cooling solution on that stage really
quiets got the 0 rpm fan mode and all
that good stuff and I've done a well I
haven't done a lot of streaming with AMD
cards so I can't really speak to the
experience there but my experience
streaming with Nvidia cards has been
pretty straightforward and haven't had
too much difficulty with it
alright rounding things out we of course
need a case so it with the Corsair
graphite series this is just a fairly
budget case this is a 230 t and it's
black and it gets the job done that's
that's really all we're looking for here
it's just a standard ATX case and it's
got a couple fans included you can fit
all your hardware and it's you know
there's other options too of course but
hey that's when I chose finally for
power supply we got the EVGA 80 plus
bronze rated 600 Watts 600 B and this is
just a very solid and inexpensive power
supply in fact there's a $15 million
rebate card here in case you guys are
wondering when I show you guys to the
lists on PC part picker I usually don't
show
I usually don't show mail-in rebates I
turn that off but you can't get this
even cheaper if you include those and
this one in particular is one where you
got a $15.00 so you can get this for 35
bucks if you include that mail-in rebate
not too bad
finally since this is a streaming system
I figured you should be able to stream
with it like you know out of the box
more or less so I included a webcam this
is a c920 just old standard from
Logitech it's been around for a while
and shoots 1080 is it for time lapses
and a bunch of other stuff you can get
it as cheap as it's about 60 I've seen
it for 50 bucks but 63 dollars is how
much amazon has it for right now the
only thing I think besides all this
stuff that you might want to also
include for streaming and gaming system
would be well you got to have sound and
something to talk to because you want to
talk to the people the webcam does have
a built-in mic but it's awful I wouldn't
recommend that so the only other thing I
would say maybe consider throwing in
here be something like a headset so like
and for that I'd maybe recommend to
Kingston the cloud the HyperX cloud core
is a very good headset with actually
good audio and and it's only about 60 to
70 dollars anyway so that is first build
and guys of course as always let me know
in the comments what you think about it
one thousand dollar gaming is streaming
I know it's an AMD 8350 oh but the one
thing I did want to point out for anyone
who's looking at this and telling and
shaking their fists and saying Paul why
did you do that I will say that before I
chose to do what I did
based on the straw polls from last month
I did seriously seriously consider the Z
on 12:30 oh crap I'm going to forget
what that is hold on I wrote it in my
notes earlier but now it's gone out of
the three 1231 v3 that one costs about
two hundred and fifty dollars out of the
box but it's basically like a forty
seven ninety or 4790k without the eye
GPU but it does have hyper threading so
you do get eight threads which is nice
again for for live streaming okay so
there's that build and I hope you guys
like it let's move on to the next one
what is the next one next one is the
passively cooled HTPC this one was fun
because I had to fight I wanted there to
be no fans zero fans in this build and
everything passively cool the loudest
thing
in the system we'll be you standing next
to it that's my assumption anyway so
here it is it's about $600 total and
granted that is a little a little more
expensive but it's weird here when I'm
doing the passively cooled thing the
most premium components the stuff that
cost the most in here where weird things
like the power supply or I guess the SSD
maybe or the motherboard but I'm anyway
so let's start off from the beginning
which is it's a skylake system so it's
LGA 1151 socket motherboard is what
we're gonna need and I went with the
cheapest version which is the pentium g
4400 this one has lower it's got the the
a GPU is the Intel 510 if you are
willing to pay twenty to thirty dollars
more for the GE 4500 or to the G 45 20
I'm sorry if I'm messing up any of these
these names then you can get yourself a
little bit more performance on the
graphics side as it is though I think
you could overclock this right now with
the BC LK overclocking like I showed you
guys last week in my video you should be
able to overclock this a little bit if
you wanted to but who knows if you will
do that since it's gonna be passively
cool anyway though it's dual-core it's a
65 watt TDP which is a little bit lower
than the higher-end chips and I think
it'd be pretty snappy as long as you
don't really need the the quad core
performance for a cooler since we're
going for passively cooled I went with
this Zalman FX 70 funny thing here is
the FX 70 costs fifteen dollars less
than the then that CPU but again there's
a $20 million rebate card so you can get
this down to 30 bucks if you're willing
to do that Mir this has a unique looking
fin array because it's supposed to be
passively cooled you do have the option
to strap fans to this if you want to but
as reading through the reviews and
they're all pretty positive about its
performance even people who are using it
to cool like I think one guy had it with
a 810 70 50 K which is a name the APU
with a GPU built in that's going to
generate a lot more that's a 95 watt TDP
part and he said it was still working
pretty good
ok fayliss cooler here's our motherboard
the gaz 170 m d 3h
there's several motherboards that would
fit this build that are in the sub $100
range I went with this motherboard
mainly because it z170 and I wanted to
keep that option open for the BC LK
overclocking even though Intel might
turn it off which would suck anyway
though this is a pretty full-featured
motherboard it's got you again pretty
much everything you would need doesn't
have those fancy or higher-end features
I don't think it's got like an MDOT two
on it or anything like that unless it's
tucked away in the back no no no I'm
about to but who cares it's gonna get
the job done and it's got your video
outs that you would need to connect to
an HTTP C which is mainly gonna be an
HDMI port sweet I also got some ps2 and
some backwards compatibility doesn't
look too bad either nah micro ATX here
is some memory g.skill ripjaws v series
this is actually some very nice memory
from g.skill that's a 2400 speed 2 which
is a little bit faster than the default
for ddr4 $13.99 that's cool you can get
a naked kit of ddr4 for in the $40 ish
range and this is even a couple bucks
cheaper so hey cool I went with that for
an SS deal with the Mishkan
eco 2 this is a 512gb SSD and again not
the fastest of the SATA 3 SSDs that are
out there but 120 bucks for 512 gigs I
was gonna go with 2 drives for this but
then I was like you know what 512 for an
HTTP see it's gonna give you a pretty
pretty decent amount of space for like
you know recorded media and that kind of
stuff I did not include a hard drive in
here because I wanted what I've really
wanted to do was go with more like more
SSD storage but I figured let's keep
with a 512 which is totally fine out of
the gate and then give you guys the
option to maybe upgrade or add more
drives in the future but no mechanical
drives they will make noise ok
Coolermaster and 200 is the case I went
with then as you can see here once again
there's a $10 mail-in rebate if you want
to go that route so you can get this as
cheap as 40 dollars if you're in the US
right now I love with this one because
fairly inexpensive it's black and it
will blend in pretty well and
htpc environments there are HTPC cases
that are you know that they're
horizontal instead of vertical and
they're made a little bit more to fit
into a home theater type look but I
those are more expensive generally
speaking and what I really liked about
this one it she can tell probably from
this cigarette from this picture is that
it's got grilling across the entire
front of it so plenty of airflow for
passive cooling it's also got a vent on
the top so some of that heat can just go
out the top but since I would be
removing both of the fans in this case
and keeping everything passively cooled
I wanted there to be lots of airflow and
then beyond that it's micro-atx painted
interior to coolermaster it's a good
quality so I thought that was a good
choice for their here's the power supply
I was gonna go with the inner max did
you fanless but that apparently has
disappeared I can't find it anywhere for
less than like $250 so at the C sonic
model which is a nice one I hadn't seen
it before
80 plus Platinum certified and if if
that makes you a little bit queasy due
to the price consider that HTTP teas are
often on 24/7 so I feel like having a
highly rated power supply for efficiency
would be a good choice there my htpc out
in the living room was on an 80 plus
bronze power supply for quite a while
and I only just moved it to an 80 plus
gold and I noticed a little bit of
savings in the on the power bill for
that anyway it's fully modular and it's
it's a nice I actually really like this
power supply for 10 60 watts means it's
got more than enough power and if you
guys couldn't already tell I was trying
to maintain an upgrade path with this
build because I like all of my builds to
have upgrade pass so obviously I could
have gone with micro ITX and super mini
ITX and super small and all that kind of
stuff but I wanted there to be the
possibility to drop a graphics card in
there and make it a gaming system and
for an HTTP C graphics card plus like a
TV tuner card like a what I have is an a
seat and infinite TV didn't include that
for this build but it's there and
available if you wanted to upgrade to
that in the future okay finishing out I
wanted a couple accessories because I
feel like that's kind of what makes the
HTPC what it is so we got a vision tech
candy board that's a wireless Bluetooth
mini QWERTY keyboard which even has a
little mouse trackpad on it and some
right and left clicks and all that good
stuff kyle has one of these and I
like it's I have a more full-sized one
that I use but uh yeah candy board and
what is this 32 bucks not bad at all and
then of course you're gonna want to
removed for an HTTP seif so just what
this little this little twenty dollar
Rose will Windows seven certified Media
Center Edition infrared remote
controller works with Windows 8 Media
Center Edition it's got the bundle on
stuff and that should allow you to
remotely control your completely silence
passively cooled htpc from your couch
pretty sweet anyway though guys that is
all for this video I would like to say a
huge thank you to any of you guys who
have jumped into chats and said hello if
you're watching this on my channel don't
forget to hit the like button subscribe
to my channel if you want to see more
stuff like this I'll be doing these the
beginning of every month and again like
I said I don't always just go over parts
I actually build the system sometimes so
stay tuned for later this week when I've
got that system that four hundred dollar
bill that I made for my parents and
that's all ready to go it's in
post-production right now thanks again
for watching though guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
