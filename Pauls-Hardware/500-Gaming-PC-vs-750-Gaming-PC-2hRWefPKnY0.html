Paul's hardware if you've been watching
my channel in the past couple weeks you
will know that I have been doing a
beginner's guide to building a computer
upgrading a computer setting up that
computer properly by installing Windows
setting up stuff on the UEFI BIOS and
making sure that like if you have an
added extra hard drive in there that
it's working properly and now finally
I'm doing what everyone should do with
their newly built computer which is to
see how frickin fast the darn thing is
because when you build a computer kinda
want to see what the performance is like
anyway though if you want to check out
any of the videos leading up to this one
including the how to build a computer
beginners guide you how to upgrade a
computer also a beginner's guide as well
as the how to do everything after that
also beginner's guide available via the
playlist length in the video's
description also posted in the card
right up there please check those out to
share them with your friends if they've
never built a computer before and
hopefully we can spread the love with
this computer building thing because PC
gaming is a heck of a lot of fun and
getting in on the ground floor even if
you're building just a 500 dollar system
I think you can get a lot of bang for
your buck as will be shown very quickly
here as I move on with the benchmarks so
the benchmarks are going to be run at
1920 by 1080 I think that's a very
reasonable resolution to be playing at
if you're building a system like this
the $750 system I think would be a great
option for anyone who's considering
transitioning over to 1440 resolution
gameplay but if you don't have the
monitor keyboard and mouse and Windows
licenses for the system bear in mind
those aren't included with the cost so
you're going to need to spend a little
bit of extra money on those and I've
posted links to where you can get
Windows for fairly cheap via kinguin net
down in the description you can also buy
windows for full price if you're
paranoid if kinguin dotnet i've also
posted some examples down there of a
mouse keyboard and monitor that you
could use with the system let's get
right into the benchmarks though once
again 1920 by 1080 is a resolution I'm
running these ads 3dmark firestrike
extreme is our first benchmark this is a
synthetic benchmark but a great way to
get a initial comparison of your systems
performance compared to other systems
performances the $500 build scored 2371
overall 2499 on graphics 6105 on the
physics tests and 1032 on the combined
tests upgraded to the $750 build we have
5678 overall 6421 on the graphics 6600
seven on the physics and 2732
combined that's a pretty big jump
especially if you're looking at those
overall scores and the combined scores
that is the impact of both jumping up to
a quad-core processor from a dual core
as well as jumping up to a graphics card
that costs in the $250 range as compared
to our entry-level rx 460 graphics card
which costs around hundred and ten to
one hundred and thirty dollars
3d mark time spy is next this is another
synthetic test focusing on direct x12
performance the $500 build scored 1793
overall 1730 on the graphics in 2000 261
for the CPU $750 build scored went 4064
overall more than double the score 4203
on the graphics and 3423 on the cpu so
some pretty impressive gains all around
moving on to GTA 5 very popular game I
loved playing it whenever I get the
chance the $500 build on the built in
benchmark scored thirty eight point one
average frames per second and a minimum
of fifteen point eight since 38 frames
per second isn't exactly the best
average frame rate I mean above 30 is
okay and playable but you really want
above 60 if you can manage it I decided
to play around with some settings and I
found that by turning MSAA off and
setting most of the settings in GTA 5 to
high or normal I was able to achieve 60
to 70 frames per second playable frame
rate so that's really what you'd want
with 1080 and you can still totally play
it just hire normal settings it's not
even that much of an impact on the
actual visual impression that you get of
the game the $750 build scored 96.1
average frames per second in the
built-in benchmark 10.2 was the minimum
which is a little bit disappointing but
minimums can bounce around a lot
I found that live gameplay using these
same high resolution benchmark settings
still got me 90 to 95 frames per second
on average so just fine for 1080 gaming
even at the highest settings you can do
and I would imagine that even if you
jumped up to 1440 you could still get
yourself around 60 frames per second
moving on to overwatch these benchmarks
were run at Ultra settings not epic like
I usually do I found the $500 build
scored 69 point 7 average frames per
second 50 for minimum totally totally
fine for playing overwatch at 1080 $750
build 181 and average frames per second
and 146 was the
again a huge boost and it's really cool
to see that with just another $250
invested in the initial system we're
seeing double and sometimes close to
triple the frame rate that you get
especially if you're playing a game like
over arch which isn't quite as GPU
intensive but that really high frame
rate hundred and eighty 1.1 average
frames per second with a $750 build
would be very appealing to someone who
wanted to get a fairly budget system but
that invest a little bit more in a
monitor that did say 120 or 144 kurtz
refresh rate get yourself really fast
smooth gameplay you don't necessarily
need a hugely powerful system to do that
with a game like overwatch but it's
still possible so that's good to know
csgo is up next this is another game
that is not terribly intensive to play
when it comes to the GPU that you need a
lot of people are interested in playing
csgo at really high frame rates I'm
happy to say that the $500 build was
consistently up in the 150 280 frames
per second range bear in mind that I
have no idea how to play csgo personally
but I did run around and pretend for a
little bit so that's really nice
especially if you're going with again a
high refresh rate monitor $750 build
improved on that it wasn't quite as much
of a jump as that we saw with the other
games I was seeing 150 270 at minimum
but often times it was hitting 200
frames per second and even getting up to
the 220 and 230 range so very good
performance there as well finally we
have doom and I tested doom using Vulcan
rather than OpenGL and I did it a
different way so I'm running a 1080 but
I decided to test it at low medium high
and ultra using just that intro sequence
so I could compare them side-by-side and
see what the frame rates work
you
so what have we learned from these
benchmarks well I learned that the $500
billed easily was able to handle 1080
gaming at medium to high settings as
well as high frame rate gameplay and
less demanding games like csgo and
overwatch which I thought was really
cool I mean most of the time if you
consider a budget build like five
hundred dollars or less you think like
wow you're really going to have to turn
the settings way down in most games but
it would actually perform very well as
long as you're playing at ten $8,750
build shows how much of a boost you can
get by spending just a little bit more
with a quad core at $250 price range GPU
like the gtx 1060 in here gets you high
to ultra settings at 1080
an allows you to easily transition over
to a 1440 monitor if that's something
that you're considering doing in the
future now as far as temperatures go
that was a big concern here and I'm
happy to say that my addition of this
extra fan made a pretty big difference
the $500 build tested as is the CPU hit
64 degrees Celsius max while gaming GPU
was at 76 degrees max those are
perfectly adequate temperatures a little
bit warmer than you might want but
nothing that's like a real concern for
you now the $750 build I'm happy to say
the temperatures actually went down even
though I upgraded to hardware that's
actually going to generate more heat and
I think that is almost entirely due to
the fact that I upgraded and added an
additional 120 millimeter intake fan
here on the side to supplement the 120
that came with the case for the $750
build
CPU hit 58 degrees C max while gaming
the GPU hit 65 degrees C max while
gaming even though we're still using the
stock heatsink fan so I thought that was
pretty nice too although I will say that
noise was definitely impacted since
we're using a fairly generic fan here
this is just when I pulled out of my
collection but should be comparable to
the kinguin fan that's linked in the
video description this is a bit Phoenix
it's just a pretty standard case fan
that you would get with a normal case
but spending five to ten dollars on a
fan will give you a fan that works but
might be a little bit louder spending
fifteen to twenty-five dollars on the
fan would get you a fan that works and
is also quiet the upshot though is going
to be noise testing so let's quickly
listen to that I set up Unigine valley
to run on a loop
let it run for a while and then did
standard noise testing using my shotgun
mic here's the $500 build
and here's the $750 built
here is just a touch of coil line coming
from the 1060
so there you go guys performance noise
and temperature testing with this build
in both configuration let's talk pros
and cons the pros for this build would
obviously be price to performance since
we're talking about an entry-level build
I like the size it's a micro ATX case
rather than full-size ATX so it's fairly
diminutive and would fit you know if you
had a small desk or something like that
you also have upgrade options which is a
big reason why I went with a
current-generation sockets the LGA 1151
sockets current generation platform from
insel with this be 150 chipset you can't
overclock but you can upgrade to other
skylake processors which are the new and
fastest processors at least on the
consumer mainstream level that Intel
currently offers so from the 6100 you
can go to a 6400 or 6500 you can even go
to a 6600 or 6700 don't get the case
skews because again you can't overclock
and you won't really get much out of
that but if you did go with a z170 board
to start off with and in my monthly
builds video I did recommend
a different version of this system that
has a z170 board you can even upgrade to
an overclockable processor just bear in
mind you would also have to buy a heat
sink fan that those don't come with and
more on the heatsink fan it's just a
second so upgrade options I think are
really important especially if you're
building a new computer you're building
it yourself you want to learn how to do
it in how to make it better in the
future those are kind of the main
reasons and the main things that I like
about this computer there are a fair
amount of cons though and things you
should consider and be aware of if
you're building in the system one would
just be all those little things that
make me kind of appreciate really
expensive hardware not sound to uppity
about my PC hardware or whatever but a
$40.00 case just isn't going to give you
all of the accessories and amenities and
ease of use that a $80 case or even a
hundred and $50 case will get you so
spending a little bit more can get you
more stuff as has been pointed out
extensively in the comments on these
videos the case as well I mean it's a
budget case so you don't really get as
much cable routing there's no dust
filters included the motherboard is also
a budget mod motherboard being a v1 50
chipset you can't overclock the
processor if you get an unlocked SKU
processor you can't even really plug in
XMP settings to set your memory up to
the faster speed for example it's also
using a stock heatsink fan
which I try to avoid at all costs if I
can but for a budget bill that just
makes a lot of sense it's a 20 or $30
investment in a heat sink fan that you
don't need to spend you also have a lack
of advanced upgrade options in this one
so again the overclocking overclockable
CPUs the amount of space that you have
in the case I have to drive melts here
that I've used there's two five and a
quarter inch bays up here that you might
be able to wedge something else in there
but you're really kind of hitting the
maximum of what you can fit in here
aesthetics it's not the prettiest case
it's it's a very standard boxy case
there's no side panel window my cabling
from the power supply has ketchup and
mustard going on there and everything so
yes it's not pretty but you don't stare
at your computer while you use it well
some people do anyway I'll leave that up
to your decision finally you don't have
Wi-Fi as well but that's a flips back to
the pros for this and the reason I went
with a micro ATX instead of a mini ITX
build with this is you do have a couple
expansion slots down here at the bottom
so if you needed Wi-Fi you could pop in
a Wi-Fi card if you even wanted to set
this up as like a capture computer you
have an extra slot down there so you
could pop in like a capture card TV
tuner card
there's other things you could do with
the system besides just making it a
gaming PC so I like that room for
expansion as well finally I wanted to
address at least a couple questions that
came in on the other videos I posted
about this the first one directly is
from moist Twinkie which is a fantastic
user name by the way he just asked if I
change the motherboard do I still need
to reinstall the OS I recommend if
you're doing an upgrade from a
motherboard or something like that to
always do a fresh install of your
operating system it's just a better way
to go but if you change your motherboard
and you have Windows 10 already
activated
chances are Windows 10 will not activate
on the new motherboard Windows 10 seems
to set up a hardware ID for the system
that you activate it then remembers that
hardware ID and it's a issues you what
is called a digital entitlement so if I
was to for example erase the hard drive
reinstall windows 10 on this and just
plug it into the internet it would
activate Microsoft would say you have an
activated Windows license just by
recognizing the hardware that's
installed here so if you swap your
motherboard yes windows might suddenly
say
this is a new computer now and you need
to reinstall your operating system or
buy a new license or something like that
but often in those situations you can
call Microsoft and do their activation
line and that work
quite a few people commented on the fact
this case is ugly and the computer is
ugly and I have no real response to that
other than that it's a budget system
quite a few other people said can I
upgrade the CPU cooler and yes you can
but it would be quite a challenge and a
pain in the butt because this
motherboard does not have a cutout on
the backside of the motherboard tray so
you would have to basically pull the
whole motherboard out and essentially
rebuild the whole system to put that CPU
cooler on there so again a lot of stuff
that sort of points towards some of the
things that you don't get when you're
sticking to a budget but I'm still happy
with this build because I think when it
comes to entry-level PC building what
I'm focusing on is getting a working
full-featured system with all the
individual components sticking to a
budget which is very hard to do once you
start to say like oh just spend 20 bucks
more on the case and you know you can
get this slightly better graphics harder
to spend this much more you got a 6500
CPU there which is about 190 bucks you
could spend 20 bucks more and get a 6600
or something like that start tacking all
those on and suddenly it's not a $500
bill anymore or a $750 build it's a $900
build but you can always say that you
can always spend more money and get
better cooler stuff to put in there it's
all about what you choose to put in
there for now how it works and what you
could potentially add in the future
which is kind of what I was trying to
focus on this one base basic PC building
is about getting a full-featured system
together sticking to that budget getting
good performance and low noise advanced
PC building some of the stuff that a lot
of people aren't asking about in the
comments that I talk a lot a lot about
on my channel is stuff like aesthetics
making it look pretty overclocking which
a lot of people don't even dive into
just because it seems a little bit scary
I have videos on that of course but then
also there's the aftermarket cooling and
liquid cooling that you can get into as
well but those are all like the next
steps these videos are intended to say
if you've never build the computer
before and you want to try it out
especially if you want to try PC gaming
you can set this computer up you don't
have to invest a ton of money and then
you can start looking at those advanced
things - moving on to the next
and getting yourself an epic build or
something more similar to the system
that I have going on there behind me
