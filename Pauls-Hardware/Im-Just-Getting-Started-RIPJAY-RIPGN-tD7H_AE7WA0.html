pre-installed 140 millimeter ring white
LED fans a vertical GPU met with bracket
and 3-way radiator support for water
cooling so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is going to be disappointing I'm
just gonna leave with that mainly
because I know there's been a lot of
expectations put out there if you guys
have been following J's $0.02 gamers
Nexus maybe even my friend Kyle bit with
a little bit online you may have seen a
bit of the competition going on between
us youtubers when it comes to
overclocking and videos newest graphics
cards the RT X 28 et is since most
people can't afford these new graphics
cards because they're very very
expensive we have been trying to still
bring you some entertaining content by
challenging each other to overclocking
duels and I just want to be
straightforward from the beginning here
I've never really dabbled in the crazy
high end overclocking I've done some
overclocking but I really pretty
inexperienced when it comes to the more
advanced stuff but I do have access to
all the hardware that very few people
actually have access to right now which
includes actual r-tx 28 ET eyes I did my
initial initial testing an overclocking
video that I posted last week with this
Asus RTX 2080 Ti and this is there ROG
Strix version which has a custom PCB and
everything and then of course if you
want to improve your performance from a
single graphics card the best thing to
do is to go to two-way and we do still
have SL
but it's not via the traditional SLI
bridges it's via Z's NV link bridge it's
a noose connection standard actually
more bandwidth via NV link between the
two graphics cards than you get raw
natively between a PCI Express slots and
your CPU so that's pretty impressive
actually got two bridges because I might
be testing them with different
configurations and different setups but
speaking of my setup this is what I have
been testing on up till now my little
mini ITX system and this is a z3 70
motherboard and there's actually an 8700
K at the center of this 16 gigs of ram
so it's been a solid motherboard and
actually the 8700 K is what you'd want
to go with for a single graphics card if
you're going for the best single card
performance but when it comes to
breaking records you need something
that's a little bit more intense than
just that set up so for that reason
yesterday
I set up this test bed that's right here
behind me and although it is already
looking quite impressive and it's pretty
powerful it's not quite where it needs
to be yet I'm missing a few key elements
which I'll get to in just a minute but
real quick let me go over what I have
set up right here so this is the Praxis
wet bench by primo chill and I've been
using this well it's been in my
background for quite some time with a
testbed setup on it but I had to sort of
reconfigure the whole thing and set up a
new test bed here I'm but for cooling at
the back there's a 360 millimeter
radiator okay and I just sort of
reconfigure this for my testing right
now but at the back here we got a three
hundred and sixty millimeter radiator
and inside which you can maybe kind of
see I've got some maglev fans connected
up to that the motherboard is the Asus
Rampage six extreme $650 motherboard one
of the highest end motherboards 4 X 299
that you can get if you're going with a
scale effects processor from memory I
currently have a 4 by 8 gig g.skill a
trident z RGB kit and that's the 3200
speed kit and here is a place where I'm
waiting on an upgrade actually g.skill
is gonna be sending me a very fast kit
that I can pair up with this because
running fast memory speeds actually just
about anywhere that you can get a little
bit of extra speed or performance is
where you want to add extra speed of
performance if possible if you're trying
to break overclocking records my main
storage drive is a samsung 960 pro which
is down there on the dim to riser which
is one of the things that comes with
this motherboard and then the CPU of
course is the 79 80 X II and whereas you
can get better single GP performance
with something like the 8700 K running
at 5 gigahertz or faster
you're not going to get top scores and
CP related tests with that ship because
it's a 6-quart well thread chip 79-80 x
ii is unlocked for overclocking and
that's gonna be one of my issues coming
up here is how much can i overclock this
and it's a 18 core 36 thread processor
so quite a bit more CPU processing
horsepower than the 8700 k has now I
haven't really done any overclocking
with this yet I just turned on Asus
multi core enhancements so on a single
quartz getting up to about 4.7 gigahertz
I'm gonna save the overclocking for the
future because another thing that you
might see here is the ek supremacy Evo
waterblock this is actually mostly an ek
water cooling loop but this is also a
lot of the original equipment from the
original Arctic panther build from a
couple years ago this water block is not
in the best shape there's some corrosion
down there I cleaned it out as best as I
could but what I'm expecting soon from
ek is a replacement here an X 299 mono
block that can cool the CPU as well as
all the VRMs and that should give me a
much better solution for overclocking
the CPU finally the power supply is the
thermaltake 1200 watt tough power brand
which is 80 plus gold it does have these
sort of not that great-looking red to
PCI Express plugs on the end here
I should hopefully be okay with 1200
Watts but I might be actually pushing
that a little bit if I'm going for a
high-end overclock on a CPU so I might
need to swap the power supply in the
next coming days as well and finally the
star of the show is going to be the RT X
20 ATT eyes those are doing most of the
heavy lifting lifting when it comes to
graphics processing this is gigabytes
triple fan version of the RT X 20 atti
it's called the gaming OC 11g it is not
there horas lineup so it does still use
the reference PCB which is actually good
I kind of needed that because this is my
other 2080 Ti and that's the reference
Edition or the founders Edition and
these have a certain Z height I guess
you might say for the actual NV link
bridge and as you can maybe it's all
here the NV link bridge for the
founder's Edition is a little bit lower
these are rigid bridges they're not
flexible like we used to have a
crossfire and SLI connector so I can't
combine these two together I would need
another one of these Asus cards so
that's the hardware I'm working with
right now to get some intro numbers and
again the things I'm still waiting to
update are gonna be CPU block some
faster memory and then maybe the power
supply we'll see how that goes but I'm
kind of excited just for the time being
even though I know I'm not gonna get
that far today just because I finally
get to open up
SLI bridges and setup envy link SLI for
the first time so let's get build with
that actually we need to do a quick fix
here before I install the envy link
bridge and that is because our gigabyte
video card has an updated v bios that
was just distributed so i'm using a
command prompt here to hopefully locate
that and updated DVT Archie X 28 TPI n20
8t go3 this version is not compatible
with the version of Windows you're
running I was gonna use envy flash which
is in videos utility which you can just
load up from the operating system big a
buddy has their own executable and I'm
not a hundred percent sure how it works
so I took things a little too seriously
I thought I was gonna have to like boot
into dos or something like that in order
to update the view bios on this but no
gigabytes utility you just you just run
the executable that updates it straight
from windows so this should now have a
higher power limit than it did and it
originally shipped with I'm not exactly
sure what that was because I didn't test
it before but what I'm gonna try is
seeing if I can take that view Baus and
apply it to the founders Edition r-tx 20
atti
because that might be kind of convenient
let's see if it lets me and it seemed to
be successful I'm gonna reboot that
should help not just for syncing the
cards up because having two cards that
are functionally the same is pretty
ideal for SLI usually they'll just
operate at whatever frequency the slower
card is operating at but if I can get a
higher power limit on my founders
founders Edition card then that should
help too now there are some things I can
do to improve my graphics scores stuff
like what Jay and Steve have been doing
of course I could do like what Jay did
and get an AC unit and point it directly
at everything to keep the ambience down
so that turbo boost 3.0 can ramp up the
clock speeds as high as possible
or I could water cool which is maybe a
possibility to in the future
I don't know got too far down what I
have planned from that perspective but
hopefully more on that very soon for now
though we did reboot so let me go ahead
and finally install our Envy link reduce
and if I mentioned what these envy link
SLI bridges are like 80 bucks each so it
was almost $200 for me to get two of
these but at least they have nice
packaging I suppose if you're gonna pay
that much but here it is powering on SLI
Envy link SLI r-tx 2080 eyes for the
very first time I feel so powerful so
strong oh I should plug in the
DisplayPort to I want to take a picture
of this setup and tweet it to Steve and
just say take a all
right so we got newest Nvidia driver
loaded version for 11.7 T by the way
guys sorry this is a very reflective
screen that we're filming the screen of
so I know it's not the best look at this
but I'm just kind of trying to take you
guys along for the ride we did get the
notification that we are sli capable oh
look it already did it for us maximized
3d performance we have sli enabled we're
good to go now we can start earning some
benchmarks so here's an initial run just
to give us sort of a baseline everything
is pretty much at stock again at multi
core enhancement on CPU but that's
pretty much it that's our frequency up
here on the top left we are hitting
between around the 1650 range and maybe
peaking up in the mid 1700s so it could
definitely be improved there maintaining
higher clock speed temperatures weren't
horrible but peaked at about mid to low
60s in one test and got up into the low
70s and another test for both GPUs
overall score of 10,000 184 which
doesn't seem too too horrible till
actually compare it to current ongoing
scores so right now we've got gamers
Nexus with a score of 14 491 and J
apparently just increased this score to
15,000 J still been working on stuff so
I have quite a hill still to climb here
I need to increase my score by 5,000
points still which
be challenging but we'll see how I can
do I think for starters though I'm gonna
dial in a modest overclock here's
something I think can be stable on both
GPUs and then I'm also going to go into
the Nvidia control panel to change some
of the global settings as well as the
settings specifically for firestrike
that Steve and Jay have been using that
was recommended by kingpin then we'll
run it again and see what kind of
improvement we get there why does it say
I have a 70 900 X is this the wrong
processor I think this this is wrong
processing how did I do that I don't
know 7900 X that's hilarious laughs
you're here totally fine
okay did that where the hell's my 79 80
XC I just I've just stumbled upon a
discovery here which I probably should
have realized before now here's my score
look I'm on the leader board break in
ten thousands it thinks I'm Canadian
just like it originally thought J was
Canadian although they fixed that for
him recently I install the 7900 X what a
fricking brain fart that is but like I
thought it was the 79 80 XE I need to
find my 79 80 XE cuz right now this is
7900 X I can at least still try to break
the top 10 I think I might have a chance
at that so let's let's go down so just a
few changes here guys
I did the adjust image settings in
preview with the performance slider got
that over to max and then under manage
3d settings I increased the texture
filtering quality to high performance
and then on program settings
specifically for 3d mark a preferred
maximum performance for the power
management mode for some reason now when
I load up 3d market tells me I should
disable g-sync which is odd because this
is not a g-sync monitor so I'm just
gonna ignore that and then for our
overclock settings I'm using the base
functional settings that I had for the
founders edition when I first tried
overclock it which is 800 plus 800 on
the memory plus 1 it was plus 148 on the
GPU which brought the boost clock up to
1783 then also max at the voltage slider
max at the power slider as long as that
takes and then did the same with other
GPU to power slider in case you're
wondering is going up two hundred and
twenty three percent so I'm not sure
what that be BIOS up they did for us
there oh and then I also increased the
fan speeds were at about ninety percent
on both cards to give us as much cooling
as we can for right now also my air
conditioner is on so let's run the test
see what happens here oh no some of the
distractions people and just want to
score oh okay for it come on top ten it
didn't crash that's a good thing oh my
gosh like I think I'm like 20 points
from the top ten or something like that
is very very very close 11200 so I'm
about 72 points behind this probably
hasn't updated my last score of 10000
184 is still down there I'm too close
now so I gotta I gotta adjust just one
or two things do you think is not on why
does it telling me the jisuk is on
frequencies are definitely better but
they're still bouncing around a lot
we're in the eighteen and 1900s now on
html5 making 20 etc temperatures are
still all within range not a big deal
there the memory seems fine so let me
try to add a little bit more memory
juice and see what we can do there I'm
closer closer that could be seen pause
starting to go mad North End's there we
go
that's where that's where that's gonna
be profitable
more fresh air this is the intake this
is the exhaust need to break 11 to 11
come on oh I did 11 to 21 10 points 10
points overdue rules pathetic score 11
of 11 to 11 I now have 11 to 21 and I've
broken into the top 10 four times by
extreme benchmark results on 3d marcom
which i think is a perfectly adequate
time to end this video thank you guys so
much for watching as I hopefully told
you guys from the beginning I don't
think I'm ready to go especially since I
totally thought I had a different CPU
installed in the system than I actually
do it's probably kind of a first world
problem to get my sky like X CPUs mixed
up and install the wrong one but I will
be coming back to this again I do have
some more hardware arriving so I'll
follow up later this week get the 18
core installed maybe get some water
blocks on the GPUs see what else I can
do to improve that score and give Jay
and Steve a bit more competition because
they're still battling it out right now
Jay just recently broke 15,000 gamers
nexus is right behind the gamers Nexus
is not water cooling their graphics
cards yet so still a lot more to come
here guys thank you so much for watching
this video if you did enjoy hit the
thumbs-up button and leave me a comment
in the comment section down below if you
have any suggestions any like insider
tips on high-end overclocking that might
help me out since I'm still kind of just
dabbling in this area but thank you all
so much for watching and we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
