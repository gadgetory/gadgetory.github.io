to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
coolermaster guys I'm over at fantex now
they have a new revision of their enthu
pro-am case some water flowing stuff as
well as the shift X the final version
sort of here with the N food Pro and
which you maybe have seen before but
this one has been upgraded in order to
make it a special edition so first off
right at the front at the top you might
notice a bit of our GP accents on here
that hasn't existed on the NP Pro and
before neither the original version nor
the tempered-glass version that's right
here so they basically have added a RGB
controller the same one that you might
find on end to evolve for example so it
allows you to manually select different
RGB colors or of course you can tie it
in with the motherboard and it already
works with the Asus aura as well they
believe MSI mystic light and you can
automatically connect it to another
board to control all of the LEDs in the
case now inside the case you might also
know some notice some white accents
which which gives it a distinct look and
that's what makes it a special edition
so if you guys are looking for a
two-tone black and white version of the
n3 pro em with some RGB connectivity
well there it is now inside here you're
going to see a lot of fan texts of water
cooling stuff a lot of the tubing and
fittings and stuff that they have just
been working on they told us that this
is just finally shipped into the US and
you might be able to find these fittings
at performance pcs or directly from the
fan Tech's website also everything on
the right
they have a new reservoir / pump and
I'll show you guys more on that in just
a second but before we get into that
let's take a look at these these are
called the halos we got the halos
standard on left the halos Lux on the
right these are not fans
they fans they are fans but the fans
brackets is what I'm trying to say okay
so you got a bracket like this now these
available in a plastic finish on the
left as well as this aluminum finish on
the right they're going to be about 10
bucks for the ones on the left and
they're going to be about 17 or 21
dollars for these over here depending on
the size that you get if you want the
metal frame but it's just a frame that
can go over any fan and they have
examples here with the black fans on the
top white fans on the bottom has an
array of LEDs are on the outside that
shoots across the fans so if you have
like a high-performance fan that you've
always wanted to add
TV - or lighting - and then you can do
that these just have the standard four
pin RGB connector that all of the fan
takes RGB strips and everything connect
up with and a pretty cool option to drop
onto something like say I'm going to say
a knock to a industrial fan would be a
great option for something like that
here's the glacier series ar160 this is
that combination reservoir and pump or
optional pump thing that I was just
telling you guys about basically it's an
acrylic milled reservoir and then it's
got a space on the bottom where you can
drop in is pretty much a standard DDC
pump like this one right here on the
back of it you also have a heat a heat
sink that's actually aluminum and
they've got a nickel plated copper
plates in between to make sure the
aluminum doesn't contaminate any of the
fluid in your loop it also comes with a
bracket can I fix that to any 120
millimeter or 140 millimeter fan mount
on your case and then you can position
this pump reservoir in a lot of
different configurations so pretty good
option there now if you guys watch my
CES coverage this year I already showed
you quite a few of the glacier series of
GPU blocks at San Texas making they come
in a nickel finish or a sandblasted
finish the black finish right there
sandblasted aluminum what I'm trying to
say they've already got those for the
Founders Edition as well as the asus
strix they're expanding this line with
some MSI and gigabyte options as well so
it's always nice to have GPU block
choices and especially if you want
something from fantex and especially if
you have a custom designed GPU from the
likes of MSI or gigabyte don't you got
options for there - once again here's a
look at the fittings really quick these
are available and compression as well as
so you can compression fitting as well
as hard line tubing so you can use soft
or hard tubing with these also finished
in black or in silver and they have a
nice nice finish to them they're very
solid again they got a couple of systems
setup here with these so fantex is
really kind of fleshing out their entire
line of liquid cooling products they've
also added the glacier C 350 a right
here there's an AMD version so AM for
fanatics you can now water cool your
Rison cpu with this compatible in am
force
now also if you watched my CES coverage
we briefly covered project to 1/7 which
are mini ITX chassis concepts from
fantex these have now been named they're
called the shift X so you got a tall one
here in the front got a shorter one
there and the back tall one is going to
retail for 160 US dollars 159 I round it
up to 160 and the one in the back is
going to be a hundred and ten dollars
one hundred and one hundred nine ninety
nine if you want to save a penny or two
again these are made for mini ITX builds
so compatibles mini ATX motherboards of
course but why would you need something
that's tall if you have a mini ITX board
well to water cool that's why you do
that and I pray right now they have set
up with one of the adjustments they made
from project to 1:7 which was to reverse
the mounting of the GPU so you could
actually see the business end of it and
which they have displayed here with one
of their water blocks which looks really
nice now there's a there's plenty few
actually different configurations that
you can do with this case they have one
set up right here I'm not going to be
able to all of them for you but you can
of course swap out the liquid cooling
stuff if you want more space in there so
for drive support for example on the
taller one here you can fit two SSDs on
the front two more down here on a lower
bracket and it can actually do two 3.5
inch drives up here at the front if you
were to of course remove the radiators
and fans that they have on there right
now so that was another suggestion that
they got that they followed from
feedback from CES was to add some 3.5
inch drive mounts and they're just to be
able to outfit this with a lot of
storage if you wanted to make an ass out
of it or something like that
now construction wise these are made of
aluminum or aluminium that you want to
pronounce it properly and the taller one
has a aluminum top plate as well you can
pop up and as you can see by the
configuration of the motherboard in
there you get all your motherboard I oh
right here up top so very easy to access
there is some front panel of plugs so
you don't completely lose out on your
front panel connectors and they're
actually tucked around sort of in the
back but the idea is that the business
end of the the system is going to be
right up here on top where you can
access it easily the smaller version
which is just the shift without the X
has a plastic
top piece let's just keep the price on
it down and then since you are
potentially going to have some dust on
here there is a filter up on top to keep
that out of the system but again the
idea is that you have intakes on the
front and the bottom it's going to be
positive pressure inside the case
pushing it up so you shouldn't have too
much dust accumulation up on top there
here's the 3.5 inch mount on the
standard shift you can you can drop the
3.5 inch drive in here basically without
affecting any of the cooling options and
the shift and you also have a 2.5 inch
mount option there as well it's just you
know if you prefer an SSD finally here's
a couple examples of the shift X and the
shift in more of a living room
environment so you can put it
horizontally like this and it kind of
takes the position like you might have
of a speaker bar or something like that
but very clean look and would definitely
fit in a living room environment this
one of course is going to be made more
for enthusiast water cooling and that
sort of thing but the standard shift
over here so you can see it's positioned
vertically and fantex wanted to show off
that you can actually fit a water-cooled
GPU and a water-cooled CPU in here using
all in one liquid cooling they have a
Corsair h-60 or H 70 in there as well as
the msi Seahawk hybrid liquid cooled
graphics card and they've actually
managed to route the radiators - for
both of them down here to the bottom to
match up with the intakes for the case
so you still get that bottom to top
natural flow of air for cooling for the
shift so pretty cool case I like and
finally guys here's the Eclipse p300
this is sort of the little brother I
guess you might say to the P 400 but
it's only going to cost 69 99 or $60 to
those of you who like round numbers
basically you're going to have RGB
control on the top again the same one
that you might find in the end to evolve
let's get going to give you a little bit
of RGB accent on the button then there's
a little little RGB down here you also
have of course a tempered glass side
panel you have a completely painted
interior does shift with a single
hundred and twenty millimeter fan in the
back and the base where the basement is
for the power supply they've actually
taken the case and sort of wrapped that
up in order to make that shroud for the
power supply which reduces on their cost
of production which is why they're able
to sell this case for
60 bucks very nice-looking case for $60
especially with that RGB in there and
then you also have again a tempered
glass side panel so a little bit smaller
again because that's a basement down
there where the power supply goes but a
very interesting design you do have a
couple 3.5 inch drive mounts right up
here in the front and you can access
those by popping that front panel off
and they put a little cable Reading area
back there so you can write your cables
for your SSDs or hard drives back there
this case does come with dust filters
there's a one on the front panel that's
not here right now because this is just
a sample and there's a dust filter on
top as well for the hundred and twenty
millimeter exhaust and here in the back
you can see even with a budget case you
got a pretty decent amount of cable
management they put a nice little
tucked-away a routing area there so you
can fit most of your large cables and
then again thanks to the fact that
you've got a covered up PSU basement
down at the bottom just tuck away all of
the rest of your cables and you're good
to go that is again the p300 from fantex
and it will be available when will it be
available when can we buy this q3
they're saying so right in that time
frame
nice nice budget option 60 bucks I like
it good job man ticks again keep saying
good job paintings so guys that wraps it
up for my coverage here from the fantex
suite I got tons more coverage from
Computex 2017 coming actually really
soon a final thank you to my sponsors
once again to soro EVGA MSI GCL and
