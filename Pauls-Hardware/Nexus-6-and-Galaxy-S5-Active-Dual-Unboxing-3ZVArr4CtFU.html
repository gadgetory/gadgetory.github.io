hardware today I'm going to be doing a
quick unboxing of a couple brand new
smartphones at least brand new to me we
have the nexus 6 by Motorola and the
Samsung Galaxy s5 active brand new
phones for me and for my wife the Nexus
6 is for me the galaxy s5 activists for
my wife we both just switched over from
sprint to AT&amp;amp;T because we want a better
4G coverage so here's the Nexus 6 this
was just launched in october and i was
considering some other phones as well
the Samsung Note 4 was one that i gave
heavy consideration but ultimately went
with this one because since it's a nexus
phone it will have vanilla android which
is something i've never actually tried
out before although this does have some
minor AT&amp;amp;T add-ons but i don't think
they'll be too bad it's on Android 5.0
lollipop right now this is the midnight
blue version it's also available in
cloud white so first off of the box
itself of course very nicely decorated
inside the box though we have some
documentation that will tell you where
things are on the phone important stuff
like where the NFC chip is they give you
a little metal poker thingy and that's
pretty much so you can poke the point on
the top of the phone that helps you
remove the nano SIM card although I
believe it comes pre-installed on this
one it's got safety and warranty
information of course and then they also
give you a microUSB charging and data
cable as well as a 2 amp wall adapter
now this phone first and foremost is
just big it's 5.96 enter 6 inch class
amoled capacitive touchscreen 16 million
colors it actually has a resolution of
1440 x 2560 which gives you a pixel
density of 493 ppi on the front it's got
Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which i assume
is virtually indestructible unless
you're Superman and have laser vision or
something and then for size again it's a
very big phone 159 point 3 millimeters
tall 83 wide and 10.1 thick which is
pretty pretty thin for a phone that's
this big at six point two seven inches
tall for those of you who aren't using
metric system three point two seven
inches wide oh point four inches thick
weighs 180 4 grams or six point four
nine ounces and it is water resistant
which I thought was nice because I have
my phone went before but as far as the
exterior of the phone you have a micro
USB 2.0 port that is on the go ready
that's on the bottom the eighth inch
audio jack is on the top it's a
multi-port of course you have a power
button and a volume rocker on the right
side they're kind of textured
differently so you can more easily tell
which one is which then you have
front-facing speakers this is my first
phone with front facing speakers and I'm
kind of excited about that the body of
the phone itself is kind of curved on
the back which means it's not going to
sit stabili if you set it on a surface
but this looks pretty cool it's got
Motorola and AT&amp;amp;T logos on the back and
I noticed that there where the m logo
for Motorola is it's kind of a recessed
and I've also notice that's kind of the
center point of the phone so as I'm
holding it my main my pointer finger
tends to rest there and it helps keep
the phone a little bit more balance
which I thought was a nice little touch
the census is such a big phone I found
so far since I have such large hands
it's been okay for me but this is
definitely not the type of phone if you
have small hands so keep that in mind it
also doesn't have any actual physical
buttons on the front of it which I kind
of like having buttons there this is my
first time using a phone that doesn't
have those and just has capacitive
buttons so we'll see how that goes to
internally it's got 32 or 64 gigs of
storage this is the 32 gig version 3
gigs of RAM Qualcomm Snapdragon 805
chipset a quad core 2.7 gigahertz create
450 CPU and an Adreno 420 GPU apart from
that for features you have 802 11 AC
Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.1 NFC hotspot
capability the battery is non-removable
but it's 3220 milliamp hours and I've
heard it gives pretty decent battery
life if not the best since it is a large
phone with a large screen cameras 13
megapixel 4128 x 3096 pixels features
autofocus out of optical image
stabilization do a dual LED ring flash
which is kind of cool and it actually
records in 4k 21 ATP video at 30 frames
per second and you got a 2 megapixel
selfie camera front-facing as well the
phone also supports wireless charging
although I don't have a dock for it so
i'll see if i can buy one that's
compatible and here's a look real quick
side by side with my old phone my lg
optimus G which is a little over two
years old now and one cool thing I found
out actually
was it it automatically accidentally
started it and it immediately said hey
go ahead and use NFC with your old phone
and copy stuff from your old android
phone and it works like automatically
and I thought that was really cool
moving on to the Samsung Galaxy s5 acted
this one's been around for a little bit
longer it was launched in May 2014 this
is basically the same internally as the
regular regular galaxy s5 but it's got a
rebuilt housing for sturdiness and
waterproofing and military specification
standards since it is a samsung phone
they have a samsung ified android
experience which is not one that i have
extensive experience with but since this
is for my wife she had a galaxy s4 or an
s3 I think she had that's three actually
so she has some experience with it it
has a TouchWiz UI so I'll have to give
that a go and see how irritating it
actually is right now it's running four
point four point two KitKat and this is
available in titanium grey ruby red and
of course camo green which is what my
wife chose because she tends to like
phones that are as she describes it
obnoxiously colored or loud or or just
odd anyway in the box we've got a quick
start guide it's got pretty colors and
it will explain what is what on the
phone and where things are I've got a
micro sim card of course since this is a
new 18t phone it needs a new AT&amp;amp;T sim
health safety and warranty guide it's
got some ad on cables and whatnot that
are white they don't really match I
think they're just sort of carryovers
from the galaxy s5 standard but micro
USB for charging and data to amp wall
adapter ear canal earbuds with swappable
tips so I'm not expecting that they
built their the included earbuds to be
fantastic quality but they're the ear
canal kind with swappable tips so this
should reduce outside noise it's got a
removable lithium-ion 2,800 milliamp
hour battery and I do like that this
phone has a replaceable battery
physically this phone is bigger than my
optimus G by a decent amount but it's so
much smaller than the nexus 6 it's got a
much more rugged feeling as well than a
typical sleek smartphone thanks to the
beefed-up housing it's got a 5.1 inch mo
LED screen 16 million colors 1920 x 1080
resolution for 432 pixels per inch
density it's also got Gorilla Glass 3 4
screen protection dimensions are a
hundred and forty five point three
millimeters tall 73.4 wide 8.9 thick
that's five point seven two inches tall
two point eight nine inches wide 0.35
inches thick so a decent size phone for
sure but again still not quite as big as
the nexus 6 since I'm using that Miss my
basis for comparison for everything from
now on weight is 170 grams or six ounces
and it has ip67 ingress protection 67
certification for dust and water
resistance up to one meter in 30 minutes
and military spec 810g certification for
salt dust humidity rain vibration solar
radiation transport and thermal shock
resistance on the outside of the phone
you got a micro USB to point out port on
the bottom that's on the go ready it's
of course beneath that little cover for
waterproofing so you'll want to keep
that closed if you want to maintain your
waterproof ignis it's got an eighth inch
audio jack on the top power button is on
the right side there's a volume rocker
on the left side and right next to that
is a blue active button you can hold
this down to activate the camera or you
can tap it to do some Samsung thing it's
got a speaker on the back and this
backplate will also remove so you can
swap out the battery you can access the
micro-sim and microSD card slot it's got
three actual physical buttons beneath
the screen for back home and menu and
this was a feature that was a selling
point for my wife since she prefers
actual physical buttons to capacitive
buttons that are sort of part of the
screen internally we have 16 gigs of
storage 2 gigs of RAM microSD card slot
for expansion of course it's got a
Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 chipset and a
quad core 2.5 gigahertz Krait 400 cpu
and adreno 330 GPU and then features
include 802 dot11 AC Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0
NFC hotspot capabilities the camera is
16 megapixel for 34 56 x 4608 pixel
resolution it's got autofocus and an LED
flash can record video in 4k or 2160p at
30 frames per second can also do 1080 HD
video at 30 frames per second selfie
camera is 2 megapixel but it can also do
1080 video at 30 frames per second which
is kind of cool and one last thing right
below the actual main camera is a heart
rate monitor that's built in just like
the normal s5 head now our plan for
these smartphones is to actually use
them for the next week or two and I'm
going to come back and at least do
a full review of my nexus 6 i'm going to
try to get my wife to let me borrow her
her galaxy s5 active as well to do
reviews on both of them so i don't
forget to subscribe to my channel if you
haven't already so you can stay tuned
for those videos when they're out don't
forget to like this video if you enjoyed
it thank you so much for watching as
always guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
