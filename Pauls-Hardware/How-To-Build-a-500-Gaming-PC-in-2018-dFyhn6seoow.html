hey guys how's it go and welcome to
Pauls hardware this is my first how to
build a computer video for 2018 its 2018
and if you want to build a computer to
play some video games or just to build
your own computer because it's a lot of
fun you've come to the right place this
is a beginner's guide so I'm going to be
walking you through everything step by
step starting with actually choosing the
parts to put into your new computer the
part that I'm featuring today is AMD's
newest apu that's accelerated processing
unit that includes a cpu as well as a
GPU which is your graphics card as well
as your central processor in the same
unit which means you don't have to buy a
graphics card which right now is a very
good thing because graphics cards are
very expensive before I get too far
ahead of myself though let's start off
by running down all the parts that I'm
going to be using in today's build so
there are 8 main components to a
computer or a desktop computer that
you're going to build yourself starting
with what holds everything together
that's right over here and that's the
motherboard now this is a mini ITX
motherboard which means it's very small
form-factor is important the form factor
of your motherboard mini ITX in this
case is going to impact what case you
choose so if you want something small
mini ITX is a way to go for the
motherboard and we're going to be
choosing a mini ITX case here in just a
while as well you want to make sure that
the sockets at the center here is
compatible with your processors so the
socket were using today is AMD's a m4
socket and that is of course compatible
with our AMD Rison 320 200 g apu just
going to slot him right there you've
also got some other slots in here for
memory for example over on this side as
well as places to plug in power as well
as some connectors for storage and we'll
get into that as we actually start to
build next up is our processors so this
here is our 2200 g from AMD and again
this is both a quad core cpu as well as
a graphics card not a graphics card but
your graphics capabilities are
integrated into that as well this is a
pga or pin grid array processor so
there's a bunch of little pins on the
bottom and that's what slots into the
socket on the mother
and they're very delicate so they can be
slightly bent if you want to try not to
touch them with your fingers if you can
if you do bend them don't worry they can
be bent back into place
but it's best just to be really careful
with that so you don't end up actually
bending them now your processor is going
to warm up when it actually is in use so
it's gonna want to be able to stay cool
for that you're gonna need a CPU cooler
aim D includes a CPU cooler this is
called the wraith stealth in the box so
you can use this and that's what we're
going to be using today to keep the
price down because $99 for the 2200 g
plus a cooler hey that's a pretty good
deal and you get a graphics card in
there as well
you're also going to need some storage
for your system and we have a couple
different options for that here these
are both SSDs or solid-state drives you
can also use a mechanical drive although
mechanical drives are a bit slower I
typically only recommend those for mass
storage right now these are smaller so
here is going to be your budget-friendly
option this is a 240 gig SSD and this is
typically what I recommend for anyone
who's building a new system 240 gigs
will give you enough space for your
operating system
as well as some apps and games and it's
going to be nice and fast to keep your
system very responsive might not be the
same drive I have listed done in the
video's description today so just check
down there I'll have a solid 240 gig ish
drive that you can buy that would get
the job done for you now if you want to
upgrade and get yourself a lot faster
storage this is not necessary but any
stretch for today but the next
generation of SSDs are gonna look kind
of like this kinda like a stick a gun
but this is an MDOT - Drive which refers
to the actual connector here and the
cool thing about that is it can actually
mount directly to your motherboard so
this motherboard has an m2 slot on the
bottom it is also an nvme connection so
you want to double check and make sure
that your motherboard has nvme support
this would allow us to just connect that
right there give us some really fast
storage and of course I would need to
cinch it down with the little screw
right there but these are of course much
more expensive so if you're just trying
to get yourself up and running
you're not going to suffer too much or
in fact at all really when it comes to
practical performance by going with a
more normal SATA SSD like this one but
just wanted to point out that m2 drives
are an option as well next up is going
to be memory and the memory that we're
using today was specifically chosen so
it can be compatible with our APU and
our motherboards so my recommendation
for memory is first off brace yourself
because memory places just like GPU
praise
they're very high right now it might be
expensive for you to get your memory but
double-check this compatibility support
list from your motherboard manufacturer
and then choose memory that's 29:33 as
far as the speed goes or faster this is
3200 speed but since your graphics is
going to be using this memory as well
you want to make sure you have at least
decent speed there 29:33 is kind of my
starting off points and as always you
can double check your motherboards
compatibility list for memory to make
sure that whatever you get is going to
slot into the motherboard and just work
and you want have to mess around with a
bunch of settings or that kind of thing
so that's four of our main components
motherboard CPU storage memory the
remaining three are graphics card case
and power supplies so for graphics card
I have one right here
it is a Vega 56 and let me just tell you
guys the graphics card prices are really
really really expensive right now but
that is why we're not going to be using
one in today's build and that is one of
the advantages that you get with an APU
now you're not going to get the same
amount of graphics card performance out
of the APU as you would with a discrete
graphics card but the nice thing is you
can use this system for now and then
wait and once graphics card prices
hopefully come down you've got a PCI
Express by 16 slot down here at the
bottom you can buy a graphics card slot
it into this motherboard and that is
what we call an upgrade path now the
last two components are power supply and
case and I saved them for last one
because they tend to have a little bit
less of an impact on the actual
performance of your system so any
reasonable power supply is going to be
80 plus bronze rated or better and
there's lots of options out there I
believe the one we're going to be using
today is an EVGA this is an older one so
I'm just using that for an example and
then the last thing we're missing is a
case so like I already mentioned Mini
ITX is the form factor of our
motherboard we want a mini ITX case to
go along with that and a case is where
you can really kind of make your choice
when it comes to aesthetics because
cases often are an aesthetic choice
people choose cases that they think look
pretty if they're going to have their
computer brand their their computer up
on their desk or something like that it
should also be functional enough so it
should have airflow and I think for
today I'm gonna do things a little bit
differently we're gonna take a quick
field trip over to Fry's and I'm going
to see what mini ITX cases they have
there and I'll pick one that I think
looks good case in point we decided to
quickly stop and check the graphics card
supply here at Fry's
and it looks like they're pretty much
sold out so the 1080 T eyes would be
down there for about a thousand dollars
here's where they're selling GTX 1060 s
for $400 and down here we have a few gt7
30s and a GT 1030 that are in stock so
if you're looking for a mid range or
high end graphics card they're really
nowhere to be found right now which is
why an APU is actually a pretty good
choice hopefully prices will drop at
some point in the future and then if
you're building the system that I'm
talking about today you can buy a
reasonably priced graphics card if they
ever come back and stock and then drop
it into the system we're putting
together let's check out cases though
this is the core v1 and it is a mini ITX
case and I have actually never built in
it so I think this will get the job done
alright guys we're back from Fry's we
had some lunch and now we're ready to
build so the case we decided on was the
core v1 this is from thermaltake it's a
50 dollar case and it was actually one
of the only mini ITX cases that they had
their fries there are a few other ones
but they're crappy so this is when we
decided on parts list of course is in
the video subscription again and I've
gone ahead and taken everything here and
priced everything and if you exclude the
memory the parts list we're looking at
right now is about three hundred and
sixty-five dollars now the memory if you
get a 16 gig kit and you want fast
memory and you want something that's
compatible with Rison is gonna cost
about two hundred dollars right now
which is pretty expensive you can get a
single eight gig kit a gig it stick
instead which will sort of tide you over
you can get by for about a hundred
dollars so ultimately this entire system
build is going to cost you somewhere
between four hundred and seventy five
and five hundred and seventy five
dollars depending on how much memory you
put in it
beyond the memory though we also have a
power supply of course I've just gone
with the cooler master v6 50 in the
parts list I've actually chosen a 550
watt 80 plus bronze rated power supply
from Corsair that's about fifty dollars
that will get you buy just fine I'm
using this one because what I have on
hand beyond that though all the rest of
the parts are the same ones that I've
listed off so it is time to get building
if you're building at home you're pretty
much only going to need one key piece of
hardware technology and that is a
screwdriver
Phillips head screwdriver now we might
be using a few other things as I go on
here so I'll tell you guys those things
as I move forward with them but for the
time being we're gonna go ahead and
start by preparing the motherboard and
I'm already bringing in another piece of
equipment and that is just a soft rubber
mats try to build on a non conductive
surface wood works just fine the
cardboard box is just fine just don't
build on a metal surface like a table or
something like that
getting our motherboard unpacked and
we're gonna have inside the motherboard
itself of course and we're gonna have a
few accessories that we want to keep
ready to use this is the i/o shield
didn't put out put shield and that kind
of lines up with the back of the
motherboard
we'll install that in the case before we
put the motherboard in we're going to
need a single serial ata cable and that
is to connect up our SSD and then we're
also going to need the Wi-Fi adapter
since this motherboard includes Wi-Fi
this is the antenna and that's just so
once we actually get the system up and
running we can connect that up in order
to connect it to Wi-Fi download windows
and windows updates and all that good
stuff
next one box our processor I've already
used this one which is why the seal is
broken but I repacked it to give you
guys the exact same experience inside we
have our processor itself and our heat
sink fan this is the Wraith spire heat
sink fan and apart from the heat sink
fan itself
you're gonna definitely need to have
some thermal paste now if you're buying
this brand new you'll have some thermal
paste to pre apply it on the bottom of
the race spire cooler so that's what
we're gonna use today it's already pre
applied so you're not to worry about it
just don't touch it
before you install the processor and get
the heat sink fan installed as well next
up our CPU and that comes in a little
clamshell keeps it protected until
you're ready to install this probably
keep it in here and again bear in mind
there are a bunch of pins on the bottom
of the CPU and those are fairly delicate
so you don't want to bend those or
anything like that the CPU itself can be
handled by the edges most ideally you
want to minimize contact with the top
here as well as the pins on the bottom
and that's simply to keep oils from your
fingers too getting all over it and that
kind of thing
but all we're going to really be paying
attention to is the orientation of the
pins of course and then you're going to
look at the corner and I'm one corner
here you actually have a tiny little
golden triangle that golden triangle is
very important so keep an eye where that
golden triangle is and then take a look
at your am-4 socket down here on the
motherboard itself you're gonna have a
little lever arm on the side so just
pull that out ever so slightly and lift
it up that will open the sockets and
it's ready for the cpu now take the gold
triangle the CPU line it up with a
triangle that's sort of in the edge of
the sockets so with the two corners
lined up so they're in the same corner
just set the CPU straight down on top of
the socket and it'll drop down into
place this is what is known as a zero
insertion force socket which means you
don't need to press down on that at all
if it doesn't drop in for you like mine
did just
lift it up flip it over and take a
gander at the pins on the underneath you
can look at him from from the edge just
to make sure they're all straight if
they're not straights I'll link a video
where I go over some basic tips on
actually correcting that and
straightening out some motherboard pins
but it should just drop in like that and
if it does go ahead and lower that
little lever arm that will hold it in
place it's not 100% secure but it's
secure enough for now for us to move on
to the next step which is to get the
actual heat sink fan ready to bounce
okay I've added yet another little piece
of hardware here and that is just a
electric screwdriver
I'm just cheating a little bit this
mount for the m4 socket will actually
come with four screws and a couple of
old plastic retention brackets and these
are actually made for the older style of
heatsink bands that AMD used to make and
even though they don't make that style
anymore they still have left that on
there those actually screw into a
backplate piece so if I look the
motherboard up you can see that back
plate and that backplate is what's we're
gonna install the heat sink fan to so
that should stay in place but bear in
mind there's nothing holding it there
right now so you might have to kind of
position it there as you mounts the
heatsink fan if you lay everything flat
it should line up just as we're looking
at right now so it's a mount or heat
sink fan again pretty much it's gonna
line up the screws with where they go
there and bear in mind you've got a
little cable coming off the side of this
and that is to plug in the fan so you
should kind of reality check here as
well and make sure where you're gonna
plug that in it should be labeled as CPU
fan header on this particular
motherboard is located right over here a
little gray plug so just bear in mind
you're going to need to route the cable
over to that and make sure you have
enough cable lengths in order to do that
so I've just set the heat sink fan on
top four screws have lined up I'm going
to start by just giving a couple turns
to each screw to get it threaded onto
that backplate behind the motherboard
you don't want to tighten one corner
down before you start the other screws
that'll make it harder to get the other
screws started in the threading on the
backplate and it will also potentially
puts disproportionate force on one
corner of the CPU which isn't a huge
deal but something you should watch out
for once you've got them started you can
go ahead and go with opposite corners
one at a time and you can
tighten each one down and you can
tighten those down tight
not too tight but they can be pretty
snug on there beyond that we just got
our cable hanging off there and I'm just
going to wrap that around and plug it in
to the CPU fan header and the other
thing we can do right now well we've got
the motherboard out and easily
accessible is install our system memory
this is G scale flare X memory which is
specifically made for Rison resin
processors can occasionally be finicky
with what memory you connect to connect
up to it a lot of most memory is
compatible but running at higher
frequencies can be more challenging so
g.skill specifically made this memory to
be compatible with this platform all you
need to do it install the memory though
as I've been talking and not explaining
what I'm doing is make sure that you
have this central notch here lined up
with the central notch on the memory
slot it is slightly offset so they only
go in one way so just double check that
to make sure that it is lining up
properly each edge will fit into the
slot on either side and it'll kind of
sit like that and then you just need to
push firmly down on both sides you know
kind a pin to place it gives a very
satisfying snap and these little catches
on the side will pop up and hold it in
so our motherboard is pretty much good
to go
we're going to set this aside and start
working on the case so once you've got
your case out of the box you know give
it a once-over make sure everything is
not damaged this case is very small very
boxy but you're basically going to have
two side panels on either side typically
those are held on by thumb screws in the
back so you can just unscrew those to
pop up the side panels to access the
interior and as far as the layout goes
the power supply is going to go down
here in the very bottom the motherboard
will actually sit flat in the central
area and then everything else kind of
goes on top of it there so first thing
that you'll want to do is get rid of
these thumb screws and start
disassembling the case so we can access
the interior
so I've removed all of our side panel
pieces one thing I will say is if your
side panels have clear plexiglass like
this they'll usually have plastic over
the top of it just to keep it from
getting scratched up during shipping
these are really really easy to scratch
I recommend leaving that plastic on
until the system is all put together
peel it off at the very end as sort of
the finished product type thing the
things you're gonna want to keep in mind
are that almost every case is gonna come
with a set of accessories like this
typically it will have a manual and if
it's a case that's a unique design you
might want to double check there to see
if anything mounts in a unique or
strange fashion you're also gonna have
lots of screws so the screws that you'll
mount your motherboard with screws that
you'll mount additional hard drives with
or additional SSDs you might have some
standoffs that are especially made for
mechanical hard drives and that kind of
thing and then often a set of zip ties
and these are just really handle handy
for cable management beyond that you're
gonna have a set of cables that come out
and these are your front panel
connectors so you're gonna have one
group that is the most pain in the ass
part of building a computer this is
what's going to control your actual
power switch to turn the system on and
off reset switch and LED lights for your
hard drive activity and your power
activity you also have this plug which
is known as HD audio this will allow you
to have a mic and headphone jack
connected up at the front of your case
this case has a single fan so it is
connected via this three pin fan header
finally you have a USB 3.0 header these
are fairly large and bulky but if you
want USB 3.0 ports on the front of your
case this is the header that you will
use there's a newer header beyond this
that's called the USB 3.1 header that is
the difference so keep that in mind
there's a USB 3.0 and a 3.1 if you want
3.1 make sure your case has that header
and your motherboard has a header that's
pretty new though so you won't see those
too often yet oh and final thing to
point out and this is just unique to
this case is that aside from the two
side panels and top panel I've removed
there's a couple thumb screws here that
also allowed me to remove this bottom
piece and that's what I'm going to need
to remove to access the bottom chamber
in order to install the power supply
also bear in mind there is a dust filter
down here so it's a little plastic and
and I gotta work to get it off but that
will go just beneath your power supplies
so that as it is running expand to pull
air in it'll suck up dust right there
and you can
pull that off in order to clean having
dust filtration and your computer is
always always nice to have so the power
supply supply is power and we're gonna
need to install this I like to get this
installed first because this usually has
the bulk of the cables and this is a
fully modular power supply so all the
cables that plug into the computer are
actually going to go into these plugs
right here and all of those cables are
included in the packaging and they're
all separate so the cables that we're
going to need for this build is a couple
for the motherboards so we're going to
need a 24 pin main power connector for
the motherboard that's that one right
there and there's the corresponding plug
on the motherboard bear in mind there's
a catch on one side of the plug and
there's a little catch on one side as a
plug on the motherboard too so it will
actually stay connected when you plug it
in like so hey that went in pretty easy
and then there's one other power plug on
the motherboard this is what is known as
EPS power supplemental CPU power on this
particular board it's tucked away kind
of in not the most convenient position
but it's right up there and this will
sometimes you have 4 pin plug and
sometimes it'll be an 8 pin plug
depending on how much power you have
going to the processor so on the power
supply side you might have a split plug
like this an eight and an eight but they
just fit in here side by side and plug
in like that now for the record I'm
plugging this stuff in outside of the
case just to demonstrate it right here
I'm actually gonna unplug these when I
install the power supply right now now
aside from your main 24 pin which is
going to connect up right there and your
supplemental CPU power which is going to
connect up right there you might also
have what is known as pci express
graphics 8 pin or 6 pin PCI Express
graphics those will also connect up to
these same 8 pin plugs right here that
the CPU plug connects to just bear in
mind that the other side of the plug is
different so these are typically labeled
PCI Express graphics they're usually a
six pin plug and then have an optional
two pin pins on the other end that you
can detach depending on the
configuration of your graphics card
since these are for graphics cards and
we do not have a graphics card in this
build we do not need this cable so we're
not gonna use it but I just wanted to
point it out to you guys in case you are
installing a graphics card in your
system beyond that we have peripheral
cables hard
SATA cables there's four of those
connectors on this power supply again
bear in mind this is modular so the
plugs and the power supply side might
not look the same depending on the power
supply that you're using but the other
side's decides that plug into the
motherboard and your drive should always
look the same so these are SATA power
plugs those will correspond with the
SATA power plug on your SSD or your hard
drive and they do have a slight little L
shape to them so make sure that you plug
them in the right way and with that L
shape it's pretty impossible to plug
them in wrong but bear in mind that the
plugs are a little delicate so make sure
that you reality check that that you're
putting it in the correct way beyond
that next to there you have a data
connector and that's where your SATA
cable will go since we're already
showing this I might as well also show
the SATA cable there it is right there
one end connects up to your hard drive
or SSD like that and then the other end
of that SATA cable would plug into your
motherboard finally the last peripheral
connector you might spot is this little
four pin guy this is typically referred
to as a molex plug and these are a
little bit older so you might not
encounter them but you will see them
sometimes for case fan connection
connecting up a pump for an all-in-one
liquid cooler or something like that
just bear in mind that you might have an
additional plug set in your modular
power supply kits that allows you to
connect up those connectors but they
won't always be needed just depends on
what hardware you have in your system
all right guys I've pretty much laid out
everything as far as the parts and how
everything is connected not we have to
do is get it all installed in the case
and then of course plug in those plugs
into the plugs I just showed you that
they plug into I'm going to start off
with the power supply just because that
goes in the bottom down here and for
that purpose I've just flipped the case
over entirely and we'll drop that and
like so you can put your fan on your
power supply facing down or facing up I
usually try to face it to where there is
a dust filter since there's a dust
filter right there that's the way I'm
going to face this
at this point since I already showed you
which modular cables we need and we have
easy access to the bottom of the power
supply I'm going to go ahead and connect
those up and now a move that I will
probably come to regret which is to
reinstall this bottom piece I probably
won't need to access it down there again
but you know if things get tight I can
always pull this back off I've rounded
all these cables up here have up they're
not where they need to be but they're up
here so I can see what's what and then
at the bottom here is kind of where your
motherboard will go and there are four
mounting points for this one two three
and four bear in mind since this is a
mini ITX build it's a very small if
you're using a larger like a micro ATX
or a full-size ATX case you might have
five six seven eight or nine standoff
points but make sure you have standoffs
or they raised mounting points there you
do not want to mount the motherboard
directly to the case forgetting
standoffs is something I don't know how
common it is but it's definitely
something you want to avoid because it
can damage your hardware if it's not
done properly
remember the i/o shield that lines up
with the inputs and outputs on the back
of the motherboard so just like that but
it's got to go in the case and for the
case make sure this little knockout part
right here if you line that up and apply
pressure from the inside it should pop
into place depending on the quality of
your i/o shield sometimes this can be
challenging especially if the metal is
flexing or that kind of thing use the
butt of a screwdriver from the inside to
push it into place if you have any
trouble now that that is installed we
shall take our pre-prepared motherboard
with the CPU and heat sink fan and
memory already installed take that IO
and line it up with the i/o shield that
you just also installed and then your
four mounting points should line up with
the four holes in your mini ITX
motherboard if you're looking at the
screws that came with your case you
might notice that some have this kind of
finer thread like on the right here and
some has the kind of reference thread
like on the left here the standoffs for
your motherboard may be either one so
it's good to
reality check beforehand I actually got
it right on the first try it was the
rough thread you wouldn't see 6:32 okay
one more piece of hardware to put in the
case and then we just get a plug
everything in this is a 2.5 inch drive
so most SSDs are gonna be 2.5 inch
drives like this one unless you get an
MDOT to like I should you guys at the
beginning and then you might have larger
drives 3.5 inch drives here's an example
of one of those these are much bigger
and they're usually mechanical drives
and they are they spin and they make
noise and stuff like that if you have
one of those it will be able to slot
into a 3.5 inch drive mount and this
case happens to have two of those these
are held on by a little thumb screw so
it's the touch of finagling I was able
to remove that tray and this tray would
be able to support a 3.5 inch drive like
that one and then sometimes the drives
will mount through the sides and if
you're using a spinning drive like this
one you'd probably want to make use of
these little these little rubber
grommets here then screw the drive in
through that that will provide a little
bit of dampening for the for the noise
and a spinning mechanical hard drive
might make or if you don't want to worry
about your system making any noise with
spinning mechanical hard drives just go
with all SSDs typically an SSD can mount
to that same tray it's also got mounts
through the bottom so we're gonna do
that I mentioned they find thread and
the thick thread this is where that fine
threaded the screw is going to go this
is a m3 it took me a sec but it cut
thing so there's our last piece of
hardware that needed to be mounted now
mounted so guys at this point I'm gonna
go ahead and start plugging stuff in but
for those of you who might be building a
system like this with a graphics card I
wanted to point out that this is where
you would install the graphics card and
it would go in this slots down here at
the bottom this is known as a PCI
Express graphics by 16 slots it would
basically line up like that you'd slot
in the PCI Express graphics slot down
there at the bottom you're also of
course going to need to remove these two
little brackets here at the back and
then there's a usually some mounting
mechanism at the top that will hold that
all in place then of course just connect
up your PCI Express graphic power to
that and you'd be all set to go but
again
we're not using a graphics card today so
we don't need to worry about that so
let's begin power plugs 24-pin there we
go
any excess cable I'm just going to kind
of feedback and try to tuck down here
into this bottom section bottom section
is our cable junk area where we will put
as much extra cable junk as possible
we also have the need for a SATA power
connector over here for the SSD so I'll
go ahead and plug that in well we're
here again let's go ahead and connect up
the SSDs data connection via our little
SATA cable here little clasp
pop into place so we now have power and
data going to the SSD power is connected
to the power supply data cable from SSD
here to the plug on the motherboard that
is directly behind it we also have
that's awkwardly placed 8-pin
Supplemental CPU power next is our HD
audio cable this plugs in right up here
kind of near where that CPU power
connector was all of these connectors on
the motherboard are all labeled on the
motherboard itself but the motherboard
manual is actually a really really good
resource to go to if you're not positive
where the actual plugs might plug into
other than that we just have the USB
three and this extra fan plug for our
front intake fan so I mentioned how much
I hate front panel connectors they're
always really annoying these are if you
can see they're kind of color-coded
right there the nine are so pins that
I'm sort of trying to point towards
that's really challenging anyway they're
all right there they're all labeled and
I'm going to attempt to plug pinning
making this even more difficult is the
fact that some of them are labeled plus
or minus positive or negative the LEDs
power LED and hard drive LED are the
only pins you need to worry about that
plus/minus on everything else
doesn't matter if it's plugged in one
way or the eddy all right those front
panel connectors sure we're annoying
that as you may be can see most of the
cables going over to plug into the
motherboard are kind of in this area
right here beyond that you will probably
notice
kind of a rat's nest of cables that's
just down here in the fronts up in front
of the power supply that's not a big
deal because most of the air is coming
in from the front of this front of the
case and it's going to be flowing up
here and over most of your components
that you're worried about beyond that I
can go ahead and start putting the
panels back on so here's the top panel
and if you're a superstitious person
then you should not put this final side
panel back on leave at least one side
panel off until you've started the
system up make sure it's up and running
and now as far as I can tell this
computer is all put together so I'm
gonna flip the switch on on a power
supply in the back and then I will test
the power switch right up in the front
fans spin up I've got an LED that's lit
up on the side right here as well and if
you happen to have any LEDs that are
part of your motherboard for example
like my a be 350 n Wi-Fi motherboard
from gigabyte has some red LEDs on it
you should see those light up as well
fans spinning though that's always a
good thing and that's pretty much all
there is to it when it comes to
assembling a computer like this I will
say there's one last part I want to do
right here I am now allowed to do this
and with that we have a functional
gaming PC and we didn't even have to
spend $1000 on a $250 graphics card so
that's pretty nice I like that also
really like the fact that you could pop
in a discrete graphics card to this
system and upgrade it if they become
more affordable in the future I also
like the fact that since this is an AM 4
chipset and motherboard right now we've
got a quad core in there there's eight
core like 1800 X CPUs available for this
same platform so you could upgrade in
the future to a system with a discrete
graphics card and an 8 core CPU with 16
threads which would give you a ton of
performance for gaming gaming and
streaming doing video editing at the
same time so a lot of versatility and
flexibility in this system as well as
this platform which is why I was pretty
excited that AMD was actually bringing
these Raven Ridge ap use to market
especially learning that the 2200 G is
only $99 for the CPU and the GPU
together in one but guys if you enjoyed
this video definitely hit the thumbs up
button if you're at a loss for what to
do next I will link my first 5
to do with a new pc build in this
video's description that will take you
to the next steps of getting Windows
loaded making sure your BIOS is set up
correctly making sure any drives that
you add on there set up properly as well
and there's a follow-up video where you
can work on setting up steam and getting
your games loaded and that sort of thing
- thank you so much for watching this
video though guys share it with your
friends if you think that they would
like to build a new computer like this
as well and of course hit that thumbs up
button on the way out if you enjoyed it
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
