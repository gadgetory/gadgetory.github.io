sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill alright guys worth the msi booth
and it's huge there's all kinds of stuff
they have some really cool mods going on
over here including a cotton candy
machine that's also modded computer it's
done by everybody Mike he did a really
good job and he tried to give us cotton
candy but we had to turn him down
because you know sticky hands or
whatever I have some really cool mods
I'll give you guys a few shots of those
pretty sweet but what I want to talk
about is some motherboards and some
graphics cards so MSI graphics cards I
better do this quickly because they keep
getting taken out of my hands first
let's start with this
you know when the 1080 launched and they
were like eh at 600 bucks and everyone's
like ok let's buy one for $600 and then
no one could play this pretty basic gtx
980 but you know what it gets the job
done and whereas it might not look as
pretty some of the other ones it gets a
job that it's not really going to be all
that much slower overclocking granted
might not be quite as good this one is
using the reference PCB pretty basic
enclosed shroud design and a blower fan
and again should be an MSRP actually of
$600 ms i actually has two other
versions of the 1080 on display here
though this one is a 1080 armor so it's
got sort of a black and white aesthetic
should match very nicely with some of
their crate boards this one does have a
custom PCB you might notice from the
back it's quite a bit thicker so they've
enhanced the power delivery on this one
and they've also given it of course a
custom cooler and they've even upped the
power delivery from the power supply by
giving it both a an 8 pin which is stock
and an additional 6 pin PCI Express
power connectors so that's going to give
you a little bit better overclocking
compared to the I don't I don't what do
we call this reference is this a
reference version sure it's a reference
I'm going to call that reference from
now on anyway this one is what you guys
can get right now the armor should be
coming out soon this is the gaming X and
this features the twin frozer 6 cooler
MSI has redesigned this cooler they've
made they've actually smaller heat pipes
but more of them to put them closer to
the GPU die since they are working with
a smaller GPU die on this one as
compared to say the 980ti or the titan
our tight necks I should say it does
come with a very nice backplate
just like that got the MSI logo on
Aaron some you know some some cutouts
that's pretty cool six pin an eight pin
power delivery for this one as well and
it looks like roughly the same PCB as
the armor but you do get a back plate
and you get that twin further six cooler
does feature the same size fans but it
also has an RGB LED for the MSI logo and
then it has these additional accent
points that light up in red so three GTX
Tiny's from MSI which one are you most
excited about the ones that look pretty
or the one that actually costs the MSRP
that they told us when the 1080 launched
I'm on the fence let's look at these
motherboards here actually I want to
give you guys a close-up look at the X
power gaming titanium lines so right up
on top we got the X 99 a X power gaming
titanium look look at that nice silvery
finish on there is it silver no it's
titanium titanium is way better than
silver we also have of course support
for the newest Broadwell processors so
if you guys are getting the 69 50 X and
you have a little bit of money left over
that's what are you kidding we don't
have it you have any money left over
about a 6 + 50 X but you could
theoretically slot it into this board of
course you got front USB type-c that's
one of their newest things it's actually
a little port over on this side so you
can write that directly to your front
panel if you don't have that available
first all the added bonuses that you
would expect from the MSI including the
steel-reinforced memory slots as well as
PCI e slots even steel-reinforced m dot
2 slots now those damn m dot 2 slot m
dot 2 cards I was getting so antsy
trying to jump out of your board and
break free not anymore
not with the steel-reinforced m dot 2
slot anyway if Grodd willy is too rich
for your blood let's move down to the
z170a xpower gaming titanium again you
have the sort of same look and aesthetic
you got this little add-on PCB right
here that gives you some additional
capabilities while overclocking
including surface mounted buttons for
power and reset as well as some voltage
control you can automatically boost your
multiplier if you want to directly here
if it's works like like I've seen this
work in the past you can usually choose
0.1 or full megahertz increments and
then you also have some of the
steel-reinforced slots right here they
didn't do it on the memory but you know
memory memories not really all that
heavy or anything and then you also have
an integrated USB looks like a type seep
I'm not a type C but it USB
reeport right there that's interesting
these boards all gonna have USB 3.1 of
course and then finally down here at the
z170a empower gaming titanium the
empower and the X power are both very
similar the empowers just a little bit
higher end so you get all the
steel-reinforced good stuff right there
really huge heatsink over the VRMs there
it seems like they're really going for
overclocking with this board for sure
other than that very same aesthetic look
as the other two we just showed you four
dimm slots z170 chipset LGA 1151 give
yourself a skylake processor and drop it
in there here's an interesting little
motherboard and I really want your guy's
opinion on this one this is the be 150 a
matte mortar Arctic so you'll notice
they have a white PCB and I've been
quite find quite fond of white PC mother
motherboards in the past they've even
gone so far as to specially request a
little white LGA 1150 Prosser socket
covers which is kind of cool anyway so
apart from the actual aesthetic design
of this white PCV and digicam oh it's a
p150 chipset so that means you're not
going to be able to overclock there's a
couple other limitations to it as well
but we're told this is going to be a
little bit more of a budget motherboard
so we're still not sure on the price
they're still figuring that out but I'm
curious what you guys think
is this a compelling motherboard with
the be 150 chipset or my opinion was I'd
like to see this with a Z 170 in it
because I feel like for a nice micro ATX
motherboard that looks really nice and
clean especially if you're building like
a nice overclock system or maybe even
water quality or something like that I
think that could fit in really well
whereas a be 150 granted it could give
you a really nice price to performance
ratio especially if you're going for
something like a 6400 or 6500 but I just
don't get as excited when I can't
overclock if you know what I mean and
here's one other motherboard I want to
show you this is a workstation board x99
a so again you're going to have
Broadwell support but you're also going
to have support for ECC memory which
might be a compelling option for you
depending on what you're using the board
for of course interesting thing about
this board is that they've done some
clever routing of the PCIe lanes to give
you support for 3-way SLI or crossfire
as well as you to MDOT sue and SATA
Express so you can run those at full
speed all at the same time I first
thought is they're plx bridge or
something in there now that's not really
the case there's just eight
four four and four which actually adds
up to like 38 or something like that
even got a couple lanes left over that's
super convenient
other than that dual Intel Nick's on
this board which is pretty cool and just
seems like a given to be a viable option
for a workstation even looks pretty nice
for a works the workstation board it's
got some yellow accents on it that's it
what do you think Cal yellows cool okay
okay one last workstation board this is
a C 236 m workstation 10 G and the only
reason I'll show you this board they've
integrated 10 gigabit Intel NIC out of
there and believe it or not 10 gig
Nick's are so freaking they generate so
much heats you gotta have a beefy beefy
heatsink on this that's a bigger
heatsink than you need even for the
chipset anyway I just want to show you
that MSI did a workstation board with an
integrated 10 get 10 gigabit NIC kinda
want one anyway guys that's all for this
video thank you so much for watching I'd
like to say one last thank you to my
