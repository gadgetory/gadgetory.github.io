Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool my
next journey at CES 2018 was over to the
Encore fabulous Hotel and Casino to
check out what Asus had on display and
the first thing that caught my eye was
the pg3 5vq and this is a new monitor 35
inch ultra wide you wqhd
ultra wide quad HD that means 3440 by
1440 it's a 200 Hertz refresh rate
monitor with g-sync as well as HDR so
all of the buzzwords that you want in a
monitor 512 zone LED backlighting it's a
curved VA panel I only approve of curved
panels when you're talking about a
monitor when you're probably going to be
the only one viewing it 100 I'm sorry a
thousand candles per square meter of
peak brightness it's also got quantum
dot technology and it supports dcpip
three color gamut so really really good
color depth on this display as well and
yes it still does have that ROG
projection logo that it does down on the
desk so you do still get that if you
happen to get this monitor and we don't
have pricing details for this monitor
right now but the 34 inch version still
sells for about $1300 so chances are
this one's going to be I would expect in
the 14 $1,500 range but hopefully it
will be available on the market soon
next up is a unique product from Asus
that maybe was less expected this is a
bezel free kit and it's basically a sort
of unique solution to handle using
triple monitors and dealing with the
bezels in between the monitors which is
of course the worst part of using triple
monitors especially if you're using it
for gaming so this is basically an
accessory it enables gamers with
multi-monitor setups to visually
eliminate the gaps where their displays
connects the monitors that they're
demoing it with is the RG swift PG 2 v 8
Q which is a twenty four point five inch
monitor these aren't going to be
available till later this year they're
talking about probably late q1 or early
q2 timeframe they're still refining it
and if you look at it dead-on you'll
notice of course the disappearing bezels
these plastic strips basically refract
the light in order to visually eliminate
the bezels however you can still see the
strips themselves as they do create a
bit of a slight discoloration where they
overlay on the
themselves they are flexible and they're
not like glass or anything so they do
seem like they're very fairly durable if
you need to take them off and put them
back on it's really simple you just
remove them and pop them back on there
and I guess another bonus piece is that
ASIS in their development of this
product decided that having the monitors
angled with each other at 130 degrees
was the ideal viewing angle so the
pieces that pop on the top and the
bottom of each monitor will help you
align the monitors at that angle as well
but you definitely can still see some
kind of discoloration where the plastic
overlay is going on so it's obviously
not an ideal solution but for anyone who
uses triple monitors I'd say especially
the fact that you can easily remove them
and put them back on and also the fact
that these don't seem like they're going
to be all that expensive since the
actual material is fairly simple might
be a good option for anyone who's
looking to enhance their triple monitor
gaming experience next up is the BFG D
the big gaming display or big format
gaming display I guess is what we're
supposed to call it if we want to be PC
but this is the rog swift PG 65 the
actual asus version i briefly showed you
guys this in my Nvidia video so check it
out for a little bit more on that and
some more demonstration of the big
format gaming displays in action I got a
little bit more details about the Asus
model though it is av a panel and it has
a full array LED backlight on the back
with upwards of 300 zones and in fact
they said they might even be enhancing
that because the bigger the display
obviously the smaller each zone for LED
backlighting is and they want to have a
really good gaming experience and for
HDR of course contrast is incredibly
important it has 178 degree viewing
angle though cinema grade DCI p3 color
gamut reproduction and ASA said
specifically that there bf GD is capable
of a true 120 Hertz for fresh rate I
don't want to speak for the other guys
so the other displays that we saw we did
see a couple of the competitors for
example from HP but Asus does seem to be
very confident in their model that
they've been developing right now also
got to take a look at the back of the
monitor which maybe isn't that huge of a
deal but does have the largest RG logo
that I've ever seen on anything ever
also there are a couple cooling fans
active on this display so the fact that
you have enhanced technology in there
you got a shield built into there and
also have a very high refresh rate
monitor I mentioned the panel probably
outputs a decent amount of heat as well
means they did need that need active
cooling
however anecdotally it didn't sound like
it was all that loud and I imagine once
they have these and they're bringing
them to market they'll make sure that
you don't hear any of the cooling that's
going on band behind the display itself
I also wanted to give you guys a quick
look at the Strix GL twelve this is a
desktop gaming PC so it is a complete
unit you would buy and you get a desktop
PC so I know if you guys are into
building your own pcs maybe you're not
quite as interested but if you are
looking for a solution that you can just
buy and have and use these feature at GT
x 1080 up to 512 gigs PCIe SSD or
there's lesser versions where you can
get a SATA SSD or even a mechanical hard
drive coffee like CPUs you can get the
8680 780 700 K and you can do factory
overclocking there is that option and
they'll ship it to you running at 4.8
gigahertz across all six cores which is
a very decent overclock that overclock
is enabled because there's liquid
cooling involved it's got what appears
to be an ASA tech unit in there the
waterblock has a glowing red rog logo
and then behind the front panel cover on
the case up towards the top you'll
notice there's an optical drive which is
nice to have I do like still having the
ability to have an optical drive in
there and a hot-swap 2.5 inch Bay now
the hot swap Bay at least by defaults
you're not supposed to use for an
operating system but it's made so you
can easily pop in a drive if you need to
copy stuff really quick just got a SATA
back clean on there or for example if
you're going to be using a bunch of
these systems to set up maybe a LAN
party or an eSports event or something
like that you'll often have people who
bring external 2.5 inch drives with
their set of games on it or something so
being able to easily pop those in the
front in order to access whatever is on
the drive and heck I'm always a fan of
2.5 inch hot swap bays anyway it's got a
clear acrylic side panel so you can look
and see the parts inside there is some
expandability you can buy it completely
all put together but of course you can
expand it yourself since they are using
the desktop components in there and it's
got or a sync RGB lighting as well the
final product I want to show is the XG
station Pro and I thought you guys might
find this interesting depending on what
you do with your computers but if you
like to game on the go or if you like to
to work while you're on the go or if you
maybe do work on a laptop but then you
come home and you like to do heavy
lifting work like 3d rendering or CAD or
something like that then having an
external GPU doc might be suitable not
just for gaming but also for something
like a workstation so the XG station pro
is an external graphics doc for gaming
and productivity it's got a nice clean
gray finish it's got ventilation holes
on both sides and it's fairly easy to
pop off the side panels and remove them
if you need to clean stuff out or just
get in there to access the actual PCIe
slot for the graphics card 220
millimeter cooling fans so when things
get warm it can keep your graphics card
cool and it can be used to expand for
instance a thin and light laptop and
make it into a gaming PC or add a
workstation GPU for 3d modeling CAD work
or that kind of thing also a very clean
design very appropriate even for a Mac
user I think I think it would be
suitable for that a nice gray finish
it's gonna cost three hundred and twenty
nine dollars and it's launching in q1 of
this year but guys that's gonna wrap it
up for my coverage of the AC suite here
at CES 2018 definitely hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video
