this is my first ever tutorial video
this video is all about how to do a
clean install of Windows 8 it just so
happens that if you've purchased Windows
8 the retail version at least you have
gotten a upgrade version and an upgrade
means that you need to have an existing
operating system installed you need to
already have windows xp for example in
order to use this version as an upgrade
and that's why it's less expensive but
that also is what would potentially
prevent you from doing a clean
installation and if you like computers
you probably like doing a clean
installation because it just makes
everything cleaner and fresher and it's
faster and all that good stuff so how do
you actually do a clean install with the
windows 8 upgrade version well the sort
of way that Microsoft would want you to
do it is they would want you to take
your existing operating system and do a
clean install of that now that's all one
does eight on top of it but there's some
things that might prevent you from doing
that for example let's say that you
wanted to switch from 32-bit Windows XP
to 64-bit Windows 8 you technically are
allowed to do that but you're
technically if you installed 32-bit
Windows XP and then try to do 64-bit
windows 8 on top of it it would not
allow you to do that now in order to get
Windows 8 to install cleanly from a
blank drive or SSD or whatever you're
installing onto you're going to need to
install it first and then do a quick
registry edit and then Windows 8 should
activate and you should be good to go
but for the purposes of this video
here's what you will need you will need
your retail copy of Windows 8 or the
downloaded ISO version of Windows 8 if
you go through the really inexpensive
thing which is like they're like $40
right now I think through January 31st
2013 40 bucks for Windows 8 pro upgrade
version is a great deal so you need that
either the actual physical disk like
this or the ISO that you've downloaded
I'm going to show you guys how to take
that physical disk or ISO and make a
little loader USB Drive off of it like
this you need a 4 gig USB Drive for that
and then of course you will need your
existing version of whatever OS you're
upgrading from so whether it's Windows
XP or one of the excuses for 107 and if
you're running Windows 7 and you want to
keep running Windows 7 that's fine go
ahead I have no problem with that you
should have no problem with that
windows 7 is a great operating system
but especially if you're running an
older version not one upgrade to Windows
8 and hopefully this video will help you
do that let's get started with step one
and step one is always gonna be backup
your data please backup your data and
100% not responsible for any data loss
as a result of this so back up your data
backup your apps make sure you've got
those stored on a separate external hard
drive somewhere else not your computer
that you're updating now if you're ok
with loading very slowly you can load
directly off of the disk that came in
your retail package if you want to do
that and then you just go ahead and jump
ahead to the point where I'm gonna take
you guys how to boot off of the disk or
off of the USB Drive if you want to do
much much faster and you want to make a
little bootloader USB thing like that
then you should follow these
instructions now if you download
directly from Microsoft which I haven't
been because I haven't done a little $40
deal they should be giving you an ISO to
download you download the ISO they want
you to burn it onto a disk and they want
you to load it what I am doing since I
have the disk here is I'm going to be
loading the disk into my computer
actually my wife's computer yes this has
been my wife's computer that I'm using
for all of the Windows 8 videos I have
been doing and I'm gonna make an ISO
from that disk there's a few different
apps out there that can do this the one
that I have found to work most
consistently for me is actually is over
quarter I have so recorder Alex Fineman
is the gentleman who has created this
one can download this the windows 7
version works just fine whether you're
using Windows 7 or Windows 8 and yes I
am using Windows 8 already sorry I'm
gonna load a fresh install of Windows 8
on top of Windows 8 you can do that too
now I have my actual DVD drive right
there I'm gonna right click on it and is
our recorder should give me the option
to create an image from the CD or DVD
it's yes create an image that will pop a
BIOS or a quarter 3.1 and all you gotta
do is tell it where to put the image
I'll tell it to put it on my desktop
I'll label it something useful like win8
64-bit and I will hit save and then I'll
hit next and now it's gonna basically go
through
process take a live data from the disk
make it into a little image file of that
disk on my desktop
alright so the ISO creation is finished
the next stuff we want to get the
windows 7 USB DVD tool windows 7 USB yes
windows 7 USB DVD download tool click on
that it's right here I notice this
Windows 7 still works for Windows 8
click right here to open that lecture
download it the next stuff you're gonna
want to take your USB drives make sure
there's nothing important on that USB
Drive again you need 4 gigabytes minimum
this is actually an 8 gig drive it
doesn't matter if it's USB 2 or USB 3
USB 2 might give you a little bit better
compatibility we've loaded up the
windows 7 USB DVD download tool set up
this program actually needs to install
there it goes I guess that's finished
let's see how good the windows 8 search
tool is apps ok
windows 7 alright so go ahead and then
run that and then this is a pretty easy
4 step process step 1 is to choose the
ISO file it's right here on the desktop
browse to desktop and there's the ISO
file go ahead and choose that click next
choose the media type we're gonna be
doing it onto a USB now for those of you
folks who might be downloading the ISO
and this is actually where you would
make the DVD but again USB is just gonna
be much faster
although DVD can be an option if you're
having trouble getting the USB Drive to
boot or just in general it will just be
ill be slower ok so I want to choose my
drive and when we have one available its
my 8 gig flash drive then being copying
confirm that you want to erase
everything on that drive then I will
take a few minutes to format the drive
and create the or windows 8 USB
installer and the USB device was created
successfully so next up I'm going to go
ahead and do my clean install a couple
things to note I'm just gonna be
restarting this computer and doing the
clean install right on there so my USB
drives already plugged in and my SSD
that I'm installing onto is already in
there make sure you have your Windows 8
key on you right now I'm guessing if you
do the downloadable version that
Microsoft will email it to you or
something along those lines you do need
it before you actually get through the
Windows 8 installation so make sure you
have that another thing that I recommend
at this point is to unplug any drives
from your computer apart from the the
drives that are going to install the OSM
as well as the removable drive that we
just made
the next thing I'm gonna do is restart
and boot off of that USB Drive instead
of off of the hard drive now in order to
do this you need to access your system
bios or UEFI there's a few different
ways to do that and there's lots of lots
of different UEFI motherboards and they
all have sort of different interfaces
and different ways they name things but
fortunately my asrock board here has a
quick boot selection so by pressing f11
I can actually just pull up to select
the boot device and boot straight from
it that's a really handy feature I know
like there's some gigabyte boards that
have that and I think a lot of
motherboards are really implementing
that but if you have an older
motherboard for example you might need
to hit delete to go into the BIOS and
then change your boot order or sometimes
you can go into the BIOS and do kind of
like this where you just tell it to boot
off of this right now
but for the time being I am going to
boot off of my USB Drive I have plugged
in and that's gonna go ahead and start
up the windows 8 installer at this point
you will stare at a blue new Windows
logo for at least a few minutes now
don't worry
eventually this little spinny thing will
pop up and it will proceed with the
installation but especially on slower
computers you might just be looking at
that for a little like a few minutes
let's jumping into Windows 8 setup
you might notice this is remarkably
similar to the way Windows 7 setup
looked so choose your language and a
keyboard input method click Next we want
to install there's also a pair option
you can put up with this to do some
repairs when it does starting and goes
through sup then we'll be able to choose
what type of install we want to do and
of course we can't forget to input our
product key - I told you guys you need
the product key up front this time
that's one of the big difference between
Windows 7 Windows 8
Solutions Windows 8 you gotta cough it
up right away and once you've loaded the
OS and you're online it will
automatically have to be
next up accept the license terms and
here's where you're going to make the
key decision between upgrading and
custom if you choose upgrade you can do
that and if you're ready at Windows I
like XP or anything installed you can do
in-place upgrade we want to do custom
because we want to clean install now
this is sort of a typically formatted
Windows 7 drive you'll notice there's
two partitions one is the system
partition if you're loading onto a
different drive bear- going to format it
no matter what so I usually go into
Drive options I usually delete any
existing partitions like so you got a
one drag with an allocated space you can
make a new partition or you can just
click Next and it will do it
automatically and this is again very
very very similar to Windows 7
installation it'll go ahead and go
through this process copying files
getting ready installing features and
pretty soon it'll be up and running this
only takes maybe 10 or 15 minutes next
up we'll have a few restarts and again
little swirly sign with getting ready
and it'll get devices ready and whatnot
one really noticeable improvement of
Windows 8 over Windows 7 and I say this
after having set this computer over here
up with Windows 7 a clean install the
boot time was like maybe 20 seconds and
literally Windows 8 boots in half that
time which is pretty awesome and once
you've gone through that quick setup and
I wasn't timing this specifically I
guesstimation is maybe that was 10
minutes but next up of course you want
to pick your color goes green oh we need
to name this computer
next up choose your settings I'm gonna
go with Express here although and
occasionally I might go in there and
change things and then of course we can
sign in with our Microsoft ID and this
is actually pretty handy to do it will
take your settings from different peers
and apply them and kind of make you feel
a little bit more at home I don't use
this email though this is a public email
so don't email me at this email address
and expect me reply
and we're done but does with any clean
install there's still of course some
work to be done the thing we do need to
check on is Windows activation so I'm
gonna go to control panel I'm gonna do
that very I click in the bottom left to
activate my little hidden Start menu we
have control panel I'm going to search
for activate activation or most of
activate and the Action Center should be
windows activation if you click on that
it will bring up Windows activation and
will tell you if windows is activate or
not now here is where my experience is
going to differ a little bit from yours
because this computer already has
Windows 8 activated on it this keys
already tied to this computer
but the difference you're gonna see is
right here it might say Windows was
unable to activate and it does that
because it detects that it was a clean
install and you have an upgrading you
can't do that so what we need to do now
is to actually change that in the
registry to allow Windows to activate
properly in order to do that we're gonna
take some advice from our friends at 7
forums so the site we're honest 7 forms
calm the articles windows 7 clean
install with the upgrade windows 7
version and this sort of is the old way
that I was used to do this same sort of
thing with Windows 7 the thing here that
we want to get to this is a part that
talks about the registry edit there's a
registry edit and then there's a quick
command prompt entry they have a little
file you can download I'm not gonna
recommend doing that although I've heard
it does work but usually I just do it
myself so we want to go in the registry
we want to navigate to this registry
folder and then we want to change one
value from media boot to install so I'm
gonna right click down here again I'm
gonna go to run to bring up the command
prompt I'm gonna type in regedit re GE
di t and hit OK
this needs to run as an administrator
and it will ask you next up we're gonna
navigate H key local machine software
microsoft windows currentversion and
then all the way down to maybe that's
the last one ah set up and then hoobie
alright so set up booby Oh
OBE under the OOBE folder you'll see in
our registry and sheet called media boot
installed double click it you'll find
the value to be one change the value to
0 it's ok now folks please bear in mind
that editing
is a very very tricky task and really
you do not want to do anything else in
here please do not again I'm not
responsible for anything you do to your
computer but I mess around with that
stuff
next up open an elevated command prompt
guess what with Windows 8 not only do
they give you the option to load a
command prompt here from the hidden
Start menu but also command prompt admin
so that's what I do command prompt admin
once again user account control ask for
your permission to do what you just told
it to do and then we want to type this
command s L and G are in a space the
Nash re-arm
hit enter wait a moment then I get a
little pop-up that says command
completed successfully please restart
the system for the changes to take
effect hit OK get out of there and then
restart I'm gonna do this by hitting alt
f4 from the desktop going to restart
after the restart windows should read
should load back up and should activate
properly and it'll do that in the
background you won't even notice
anything happened the only way you can
do it really is by going back to the
sort of search go back to the control
panel again and looking up the windows
activation and then you'll be able to
find out yes windows activated and
you're good to go
there you go guys windows 8 is now
installed and I installed it cleanly
without to me to first install Windows
XP or the windows operating systems that
I was legitimately upgrading from I hope
