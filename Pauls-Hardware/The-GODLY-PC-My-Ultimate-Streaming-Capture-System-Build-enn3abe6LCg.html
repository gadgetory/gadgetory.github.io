so today I was finally able to actually
assemble my godly streaming system the
athlete named PC that I will be actually
replacing my existing capture and
streaming system with which is one of
the reasons I'm very excited to actually
get this system put together because I'm
going to be getting a lot of use out of
it my existing streaming and capture
system which is powered by a 4770k and a
gtx 770 already gets tons of you sayyou
so to capture audios captured video asa
to stream our live show every Tuesday so
I just know that I'm going to be using
this replacement system a ton the second
reason I'm really excited about this is
that it's kind of going back to my roots
of PC building the focus here is really
on performance and making a very silent
running system and I am very very
minimally concerned about the looks it's
going to look like the case the dark
bass 900 but there's no side panel
window so that's all you're really going
to see with that said though after
getting my built area prepped and ready
to go my first task was actually to
disassemble my high end test bed that I
built several months ago because I need
to retrieve the CPU from there the CPU
I'm going to be using it's a 69 50 X 10
core highest end consumer chip from
Intel it is crazy overpowered but it is
a chip that I have which is why I'm
using it it actually haven't been
getting very much used back here on my
test bed I've been doing most of my GPU
testing recently with the 7700 K so the
69 50 X has really been underutilized
also in this test bed is a 400 gig Intel
750 series SSD and I got a second one of
these to use in raid so I got to pull
that out as well to run down all the
parts going into this build though at
least is for phase 1 right now let's
start off again with that CPU the Intel
Core i7 69 50 X 10 core processor it
will cost you 1600 or 1700 dollars if
you buy it.retail so I do not recommend
anyone actually purchasing this chip but
since I have it I'm going to make some
use out of it
and one of the big benefits here when
you compare it to
AMD's new rise in cpus is that it
actually has 40 PCI Express Lanes for
tons of peripheral connectivity and I'm
actually going to be using probably most
of those to cool it I have the
old-school Noctua NHD 15 I guess it
would be the D 14 if it's old-school but
be 15 massive air cooler super quiet top
of the class when it comes to cooling so
I know I'm going to be happy with this
once I get over the color of the fans of
course for the motherboard I have the
Asus x99 deluxe 2 LGA 2011 - 3
motherboard I've actually already used
this motherboard I headed in my
background system build for quite a
while several months back but part of
the reason I'm choosing this is because
again I have lots of SSDs to connect so
I need em to connectivity and then it's
also a couple you to ports on it so I
can connect up my 750 series SSDs and I
know based on the manual that I'm not
going to be losing connectivity for any
of these ports once I plug one in it's
not going to disable the others I do
lose some lanes here and there but as
long as I have PCIe gen3 by for
connectivity for all of my SSDs I will
be ok for memory I have a crazy huge kit
64 gigs a four by sixteen gig chip of
course there's classic vengeance lpx
actually what I'm installing here is a 4
by 8 gig kit but the kits on its way
when it arrives I'll just swap that and
it honestly looks exactly the same for
storage I have three SSDs and two hard
drives so the main operating system SSD
is going to be the samsung 960 pro 512
gig n dot 2 2280 nvme SSD pretty much
the fastest nvm nvm a SSD that's out
there when it comes to single m-21 at
least if you're not looking at the
enterprise range and it's going to be
fantastic for the operating system and
programs for a captured drive I have two
Intel 750 series 400 gig u 2 nvme SSDs
and I'm going to be putting these in
raid 0 so it'll give me eight hundred
gigs total and it should be really
really fast for capturing stuff like 4k
high bit rates high color depth video
for long-term storage I have a couple WD
these are actually red 4 terabyte
internal drives the
Nash drives I was going to use black
drives here but I realize those are
actually in use so I have these instead
and I'm hoping actually most of the time
these are just going to be sleeping in a
standby mode because they do make noise
but if I need long-term storage I will
have it for a graphics card of course I
got the GTX 1080 Ti I don't have a Titan
X or tight next little P on hand so the
1080p I will do it's got 11 gigs this is
the gigabytes horse version that I'm
using here just recently did the bit of
a review on this if you guys want to
check it out but runs really quiet and
super powerful cards whether it's going
to be for gaming or actually video
editing the case is the be quiet dark
bass 900 at the all-black version and
the one with the solid side panel
because again my folks here is keeping
things quiet and since this has be quiet
fans it's going to be a super super
quiet running case and I'm actually
really excited to work with it too
because it's very big but also very open
and spacious for a power supply I should
have plenty of juice to spare with my
EVGA supernova g3 850 watt again this is
just the newest version or a placement
to the g3 all black cables looks pretty
nice and totally gets the job done
EVGA has been really killing it with
their power supplies over the past few
years
not only for capture cards what I'll be
installing right now is actually one
capture card and one playback card these
are from Blackmagic the Blackmagic
Design deck link mini recorder 4k and
then you monitor 4k so one is an input
one is an output they're HDMI 2.0
compatible and they do support 10-bit
color depth so that's pretty cool I need
to see what's happened with the software
in the past 6 months for these but once
I actually get the system up and running
I will actually be adding some more
capture devices because I can't really
call this a godly streaming and capture
system which is the single capture
device I'll be adding the ones that I
already have that I'm already using in
my existing system that includes a
Blackmagic intensity Pro it's a PCI
Express card a Razer ripsaw USB 3.0
external device as well as a nagato Game
Capture HD USB 2.0 external capture card
all that said though it's high time to
get this build underway here goes
so I can't describe this build process
as anything less than just enjoyable I
was having a really good time just
filming the parts as I moved along and
the build process and everything came
together really easily I have to hand it
to be quiet but the dark bass 900
Dimitri was right on when he gave this
his case of the Year Award for 2016
super easy to build in tons of room tons
of expandability easy swapping of all
the different pieces everything comes
apart to the way it should
rivets are like practically nowhere to
be seen so great job be quiet and a
fantastic case super super silent - when
I've actually powered on the system the
be quiet silent winged youth fans that
are included there are just super quiet
right out of the right out of the gate
so quiet quiet quiet that gets the plot
I call their company be quiet
other than that though no 15
compatibility issues which is very
fortunate it's got all my drives in
there my SSDs and my you that two drives
so from here I think I really just have
a bunch of software configuration to do
I got to get Windows 10 installed and up
and running and of course I got to make
sure that all of the drivers and
everything are set up for my capture
cards and I might do that before I start
adding in more capture devices do some
basics testing I think I'm actually
going to do two follow-up videos for
this build was my monthly build series I
usually do a single follow-up testing
video this time I'm going to do two
because I think setup and software
testing alone will deserve its own video
and I'm probably after I get back from
Computex so probably a couple weeks into
June I'll come back with some testing
and performance numbers not just for the
capturing and streaming but also for
gaming as well because I want those
systems to be able to act as a
standalone capture system or to be able
to game and stream on it at the same
time but guys thank you so much for
watching this video it's been an awesome
build i really hope you've enjoyed it
hit the thumbs up button on your way out
if you did and check the description for
links to all the parts i've used as well
as some links to my store where you can
buy some stuff and help support my
channel thanks again for watching we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
