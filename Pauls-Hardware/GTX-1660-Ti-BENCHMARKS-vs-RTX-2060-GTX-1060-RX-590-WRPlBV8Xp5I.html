two-and-a-half years since Nvidia first
launched the original GTX 1066 gig July
19 2016 about two years and seven months
ago it launched with a $250 price tag
for the entry-level ad and board
versions the founders Edition like this
one was 300 bucks but nobody bought that
so who cares
we finally have a successor though in
the mid-range with today's launch of the
GTX 1660 TI costing two hundred and
eighty dollars at launch it has six gigs
of DDR 6v RAM and will only be available
in third party adding board variants
like this gtx 1660 TI gaming ex from msi
cooler masters sk series mechanical
keyboards help you keep a low profile
with ultra flat double Schottky caps and
a slim minimalist design available in
full size trim as the sk 650 or the even
more portable 10 keyless sk 630 these
keyboards feel great thanks to genuine
Cherry MX low profile mechanical
switches they've also got a durable
brushed aluminum top plate and a
detachable and braided USB type-c cable
so click the sponsor link in the
description for more on the Coolermaster
sk 630 and sk 650 so my question for
quite a while ever since finding out the
name of this GPU has been why why would
Nvidia call it the 16 60 TI which i
think is a confusing name it doesn't
really tie in well with their old 10
Series or the new 20 series but it's
based on the 12 nanometer Turing tu1 1:6
GPU which is a new diet that's different
from the RT X 20 60 and up so it does
not include Archie X capabilities so no
RT cores in this no hardware support for
ray tracing or DL SS but that GPU name
tu1 1:6 is theoretically why it's called
the gtx 1660 although one one six would
be eleven sixty go home in video you're
drunk but whatever color your GPUs
whatever you want them to just don't
blame us for getting confused about them
more to the point functionally maybe
it's a good thing that those are TX
features like you have in the 2060
enough are not available on the 16 60 TI
because those cards are more expensive
and this one is at least less expensive
at two hundred and eighty dollars also
those RT X features have had pretty
limited use since they were introduced
about six months ago when the 2080 TI
and 2080 launched so a less expensive
Turing GPU with a confusing name but no
RT X could maybe still be a good product
depending on how it stacks up against
the competition stats wise we have one
536 CUDA cores with 24 SM units 6 gigs
of DDR 6 memory on a 192 bit bus with a
12 gigabit per second data rates a base
clock of 1500 megahertz and a boost
clock of 1770 but since there will be a
lot of ad and board manufacturer
overclocked versions out there like this
one those numbers will vary from card to
card when it comes to frequency
supplemental board power at least on
this MSI card and also as recommended by
Nvidia is handled by a single 8 pin PCI
Express graphics power connector and on
this card we have 3 DisplayPort 1.4 's
and an HDMI 2.0 B 4 video that's the
reference effects from Nvidia call for
one HDMI one DisplayPort and one DVI but
it will be up to Edinburgh partners to
change that if they do want but note
that there is no inclusion of a USB
type-c 4 virtual link support so if you
want virtual link support for VR you
will need to spend 70 bucks more on at
least in RTX 2060 if you want native
support speaking of spending 70 dollars
more for an RT X 2070 should you just do
that I have benchmarks to help you guys
decide with that and these were all run
fresh within the past 48 hours on this
test system featuring an Intel Core i
$9.99 hundred K at 4.8 gigahertz and
asrock the Z 390 Taichi ultimate
motherboard a cooler master ml 360 our
RGB all-in-one liquid cooler 16 gigs of
g.skill trident z RGB ddr4 memory at
3200 Kesley and c 14 a samsung 960 pro
512 gig nvme SSD an EVGA supernova g3
650 watt 80 plus gold rated power supply
and Windows 10 64 bit that's all housed
in the LAN Lee PCO 11 dynamic white
tempered glass case and I chose three
comparison GPUs because they are the
ideal GPUs to compare this new GPU to
first we have the gtx 1066 gig because
we need to see how much faster the 16 60
Ti is this one is represented by this
gigabyte g1 gaming aversion it is
manufacturer overclocked running at
about 1950 megahertz
under load on the GPU core next is the
rx 598 gig from AMD's Radeon team
because it costs about 260 dollars right
now and is the closest competitor to the
1660 Ti and in my humble opinion maybe
even the reason the 1660 Ti exists as we
might see in a second finally of course
we have the RT X 2060 which can easily
be found in third-party add-on board
variants for 350 dollars only $70 more
than a 16
60 TI and in my opinion potentially its
biggest competitor given how much more
performance you can get for about $70
more which is about the cost of a
triple-a gaming table right now that
said here are the benchmarks starting
off with 3d mark firestrike ultra this
is a synthetic benchmark but it's
running at 4k and this is Direct X 11
now here right out of the gate the RX
590 is going hard with a score of 3703
and a graphics core of 3664 beating both
the 1066 gig and the 1660 ti however
spoiler alert this is the RX 5 90s only
wins so enjoy it while it lasts next is
3d mark time spy extreme the extreme
mode so it's also running at 4k and this
is a DirectX 12 test here the 16 60 TI
scores 3076 with the graphic score of
2807 T 4
this represents significant games over
the GTX 1066 gig as well as the rx 590
although still remains wall short of the
RT X 2060s
GPU score of 3423 next is VR mark blue
room which is a bit more of an intense
VR focused test and here the Archie X
2060 comes out on top once again with
the score of 2,352 but the 1660 Ti also
has a very nice showing with the score
of 1981 which is at least 600 points
more than the rx 590 moving into some
actual game testing and I'll be testing
at 1920 by 1080 as well as 2560 by 1440
so here at 1414 ashes of the singularity
escalation which is a DirectX 12 test we
have the Archie X 2060 coming in with 48
frames per second over the 1660 TI's
41.6 frames per second which is about 13
or 14 percent faster a decent jump not
huge but both of them are well
outperforming 210 60 and 590 which are
coming in at 33 FPS at 1080 the results
are largely the same although the 1060
picks up a little bit of a lead over the
RX 590 and these 2060 has only about a
10 percent lead over the 16 60 TI next
to shadow of the Tomb Raider using the
high preset this is also a DirectX 12
test and here the 2060 is about 11% a
little more than 11% faster than the 16
60 TI so that is what you get for your
extra 70 bucks 16 60 T I got 55 frames
per second once again outpacing the 590
and the 10 60 at 1080 the RT X 2060
still maintains Lee
over the 1660 ti but only about 11% now
meanwhile the 1066 gig has 57 FPS which
is a bit behind the RX 5 90s 66 fps and
maybe an early indicator of why Nvidia
felt like they needed to launch a new
graphics card to compete with the RX 590
next we have GTA 5 this is DirectX 11
and running at 2560 by 1440 the 2060 has
a little bit less than a 10% lead over
the 16 60 TI with 102 frames per second
compared to 92 frames per second here
the RX 590 actually suffers a bit
compared to the 1066 gig and I believe
this is one of the only games where the
1066 gig beats the RX 590 and 1920 by
1080 we have a similar set of numbers
although bear in mind if you're looking
for a high frame rate solution if your
gaming at 1080 and you have a higher
refresh rate monitor now you have
several options amongst this group but
the 2060 is still of course coming in
first with 145 fps and that's about 9
percent faster than the 16 60 TI next up
is battlefield 5 DX our functions have
been turned off for this testing since
the r-tx 20 60 is the only card that is
compatible with them it scored 78 FPS
compared to the GTX 1660 Ti is 68 which
is about 10.5 percent faster and then
moving over to 1080 the RT X 2060 was
able to break a hundred FPS on average
102 is what it scored compared to the
1660 T is 90 fps that's about 9.5
percent faster and here the RX 590
really takes a lead over the 1060 with
83 fps compared to 67 next up is
overwatch running at 2560 by 1440 the RT
X 2060 has 131 FPS compared to the GTX
1660 T is 113 fps we have very good 1%
low numbers all around here but
overwatch usually does a good job with
that the 2060 though has about a 13 or
14% lead over the 16 60 TI though and
here the 10 60 and 590 are almost neck
and neck when it comes to their numbers
that also repeats looking at 1920 by
1080 numbers with 135 at harder than 36
fps respectively for the 1060 and 590
meanwhile the 16 60 TI shoots up 271 fps
so a very good option for high refresh
rate gaming if you want to play
overwatch meanwhile the RT X 2060 got
197 FPS and that is about 13.2% faster
than the 1660 TA and finally we have the
newly released Metro Exodus and I am
using the built-in benchmark for this
game which is more intense than the
actual game itself so you will get
better frame rates if you actually play
the game than if you're comparing the
numbers you get in the built in
benchmark this is direct x12 though I
have advanced physics and Harry works
turned off at 1440 the 1660 ti has
thirty four point seven average frames
per second compared to the RT x 26 TS
41.3 so the 2060 is about 16% faster
meanwhile at 1920 by 1080 we have 40 5.3
FPS for the 1660 ti 53.1 for the RT x
2060 so that makes it about 15% faster
and here again is a game where the RX
590 clearly outpaces the gtx 1066 gig
let's quickly take a look at the
frequencies that these cards are running
at and looking at bass and boosts clocks
which are less important what's more
important is what they're actually
running at while they are under load
average testing frequency for my 1660 t
i was 1955 megahertz which is pretty
good out of the box this is manufacturer
overclocked once again but potentially
that means we might be seeing higher
clock speeds than this maybe up over
2000 did not dive into overclocking with
this card for now but pretty good speeds
just out of the box
meanwhile the 1066 gig over here as
already mentioned is running about 1950
megahertz
the ITX 2060 is running at 1895 and
funnily the RX 590 here is running at
1580 I did take temperature measurements
as I was testing but please take these
with a grain of salt because they aren't
extensive but 67 degrees Celsius was the
max temperature I hits on my trend Twin
Frozr 7 cooled 1660 Ti over here that
was the same max temp that we hit with
the 1066 gig from gigabyte meanwhile the
RT X 2060 hit 71 degrees Celsius and the
RX 590 got up to 82 what I'd recommend
if you're looking at the 1660 Ti in the
future is you're gonna want to compare
different variants of the 1660 Ti and
the cooler for it respectively to see
which one is better this is more just
anecdotal to tell you guys if they're
not running too warm although it is
winter here and it's pretty chilly one
more anecdote to relate is noise levels
again I did not test this scientifically
but the twin 407 is pretty cool for the
most part under load of course the fans
spin up and you can hear them but I
pretty much did all my testing with the
system right beside me and other than
the stress test everything was pretty
quiet I didn't notice the card at all so
guys before
I wrap this video up I wanted to test
apex legends because it's a new and
popular game so that's what I'm doing
I'm just doing some screen captures so
you guys should be able to see on screen
what's happening I have stats for the
CPU the 1660 TI memory as well as of
course the frame rate and the top left
and if you look at my video settings
right now I'm at 2560 by 1440 fullscreen
and pretty much high settings across the
board I'm probably not gonna play too
long just gonna jump in a game to get an
idea of the frame rate again starting
off at 1440 and then will jump to 1080
as well except the game just crashed I'm
changing as this texture streaming
budget because I know we've only got six
gigs of B RAM on this card so let's see
if that fixes that error no I don't want
to be junk master I'm just along for the
ride initial jump in we're getting a 50
52 55 frames per second down on foot
getting 72 frames per second I'm just
gonna pick up everything no idea what
I'm doing I've got a pea shooter set a
friend that's not a friend that's a bad
guy gonna shoot him
I died anyway okay
that's good as expected I died quickly
but that's fine because it was just a
sample of 1440 now I can switch at any
patches tried to revive me oh that's
right they can bring me back
get him patches oh is he really gonna
bring me back it brought me back that's
awesome oh thank you it's trying to help
me it's like obviously a second oh yeah
you can climb up walls sometimes oh oh I
can get my stuff back my body armor
which is super helpful patches is like
you have nothing I've got a peashooter
patches and fine we've got a brief moon
at downtime so I'm switching to a 1920
by 1080 or 1920 by 1080 now guys so
there is more frames which is good
I'll help me see much more clearly when
I die we're 135 fps now run around
outside look at me on a zipline 85 FPS
on the zipline drops down a bit see
shots just right over there gotta get
patches
look at him oh maybe helpful for my team
healing look I healed them that's why I
like being a healer I feel like it can
actually sometimes be helpful wherever
you being shot from oh oh I got I got I
got fire coming in from all directions
right now
I eliminated a person I got a kill I
don't know what's happening to me right
now sorry I got a kill now and enjoying
a game it'll say that I have a kill
right there you go
kills one more kill well that was fun
but I think it is time to wrap this
video up let's talk pros and cons for
the gtx 1660 TI pro's very solid
performance at both 1080 and 1440 and I
think it does what it was intended to do
which is beat the rx 590 and just about
every test something that it can do but
the previous 1066 gig could not it often
does that by a wide margin as well and
it's only a $30 premium if you're
comparing the launch price of this to
the launch price of the 1060 granite
that was two and a half years ago but
you know trying to give them a little
bit of credit since they didn't jack the
price up 500 bucks like they did with
the 2080 TI i digress though another
excellent thing to point out is the
power drop which I haven't even done yet
so take a look at this chart and focus
here mainly on the average power draw
consider the increased performance that
we have with the 1660 ti and compare
that to the 1066 gig we're using you
know maybe 9 watts less so it's in the
same ballpark but a bit less power and
we have more performance that's good
overall and then especially when you
compare it to the rx 590 which is
sitting more like a hundred watts more
power usage so when it comes to pure
efficiency the 1660 ti is carrying on
invidious tradition of making not just
powerful graphics cards but also ones
that don't use too much power the
reference specs for the card indicated
just has 120 watt board power design and
they're only recommending a 400 watt
power supply for your whole system
according to and videos recommended
specs the cons for the 1660 TI are that
for only $70 more you can get an orangey
X 2060 which seems to almost almost make
this card pointless but not entirely I'm
hoping what this means is that we might
see some sales prices for the 1660 ti
make it 250 bucks or less make it a bit
harder of a decision for people who are
like oh I could just save a little bit
and get the 2060 of course you're still
buying an Nvidia graphics card either
way so they'd probably still be happy
either way and the point being that
they're trying to close the door on the
Artic
590 from what I can tell also the name
still sucks I still don't like the name
and why is there a TI on there does that
mean that there's gonna be a non like it
regular 16:16 on TI are they gonna do
weird things with the memory
configurations with that and make like a
three gig and a four gig version or
something I have no idea I hope not I
hope they keep things simpler or at
least move towards simple from this sort
of confusingly named product here but at
least it is a functional product and at
least it is not that crazy of a price so
if you're on the fence about spending
260 bucks for an RX 590 this card gives
you a significant performance bump and
it draws significantly less power and
only costs 20 bucks more so there you go
this has been my review of the new
NVIDIA r-tx no GTX 1660 TI 6 gig
specifically the MSI gaming X version
that you see here I'll put relevant
links in this video's description thank
you guys so much for watching hit the
thumbs up button on your way outs and
I'll put other links in the description
too so you should check that out before
you go thanks guys we'll see you next
