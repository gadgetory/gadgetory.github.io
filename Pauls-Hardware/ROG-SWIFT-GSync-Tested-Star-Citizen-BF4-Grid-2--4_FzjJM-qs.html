today and the product is right here or
at least the product box this is the
asus rog swift gaming monitor and so
this product out there that i've gotten
a ton of requests for to do some
coverage on it is this monitor it's
actually set up right here behind me I
have a whole gaming rig set up out here
in my living room so I can get the AC
and do some actual gameplay
now this monitor features not only G
sync but it's a 27-inch monitor really
really fast refresh rate it can do 144
Hertz and the G sink means everything is
going to be super smooth and it's gonna
synchronize your graphics cards output
with the refresh rate of your monitor
and from whatever / that's very
fantastic now I don't get to do a whole
lot of gaming but I do enjoy it so today
I've set this all up so I can do some
hands-on gameplay for you guys give you
some of my reactions and some of my
feedback and see how that goes so I'm
really excited and I think yeah let's
just get started
so one of the immediate side effects
actually of getting the RZ Swift is that
friends who have been really really
really wanting to try it out we'll just
kind of materialize and start playing
video games so Steve Steve's right here
and that's okay though
it'll give us something something to
look at while I'm talking so we're gonna
press on here he's playing some
battlefield 4 and if you're wondering
what's video cardies on it's the gtx 780
Ti now first with GeForce you need to
use an Nvidia graphics card and it has
to be a GTX 650 Ti boost or better in
order to actually use g-sync
and in fact you actually need to have a
DisplayPort connector as well as you can
see here as Steve is playing the frame
rate is fluctuating it's going from 80
to 84 to 70 and up and down a little bit
and that's normal but normally if you
have vsync on it'll cap it to like 60
frames per second if that's what your
vsync is set to so g-sync will sync up
the monitors refresh rate with the frame
rate the graphics card is able to put
out and then you end up having a nice
smooth frame rate even if it bounces up
and down a little bit you're not gonna
see the errors and glitches such as
tearing
that he gets it if you don't have do you
think I've been kind of listening in to
Steve as he mumbles things to himself as
he plays and he was noting that the
resolution of this monitor 2560 by 1440
this is a nice jump up from his 1080
monitor which is one of the great
benefits of this so that combined with
144 Hertz refresh rate it really makes
it smooth and just to round out the
specs we have a 350 CDM brightness 1000
to 1 contrast ratio and at sixteen point
seven million display colors even though
this is a TN panel which they did in
order to get the 1 millisecond response
time it can still do sixteen point seven
million colors because it is an actual
8-bit penny and now we've moved on to
some star citizen Steve just shown us is
a fancy new ship this is the star
citizen dogfighting module and we have
pretty much full max settings right now
780ti is giving us between 35 40 and up
to about 60 frames per second sometimes
going beyond of course and again what
you think you don't have to worry about
it even if it's in that little middling
like 30 to 45 frames per second range
because it still keeps up I do want to
show you guys some of the controls down
here in the bottom right cuz they're
actually pretty pretty good the way AC
says done I'm Steve you mind uh Connect
connect do that real quick
maybe can I can I do the controls
it's down here in the bottom right you
have five buttons are actually tucked
just behind the back right here so first
off look how quickly this turns off and
on tada
on there's no splash screen or anything
that's pretty sweet
above that you have the turbo key so by
pushing this button it goes from 144
Hertz to 120 to 60 so you can easily
switch back and forth between those
different modes and above that you have
the game plus button this is the
cheaters button so you can push this to
turn on crosshair or timer so you can
put a cheating crosshair in the middle
of the screen above that so I mean I
figure out how they get out of that yeah
but then you have the exit button oh I
guess that would have helped just a
second ago then above that is a little
five way knob so you can push in on that
as a button to bring up another menu or
you can use that to navigate around we
have now moved on to some grid 2 and
with everything pretty much maxed out
we're seeing not quite a hundred
forty-four frames per second but it is
easily getting upwards of ninety to a
hundred and sometimes even beyond that
to 120 130 depending on what map you're
on of course you know Steve I hate to
interrupt you again but I'd like to show
this Stan's like height tilt swivel
pivot you think you could take another
quick break there's like four more races
left before I progress
nice just did a really good job on the
stand here as you can see can easily
raise or lower it you can do tilts you
have about minus five degrees or plus 20
degrees to tilts you can rotate it
either way as well
quite easily the ring on the bottom I'm
actually light up but you can turn that
off as an option and then you can also
pivot so if you want to go from portrait
to landscape you can do that as well
really really nice stand but even if you
don't want to use it there's also a 100
millimeter vase amount on the back seat
swap that out if you wanted to add it to
a different standard wall-mounted steve
has moved on to some chivalry now
enjoying the new is this a new expansion
Deadliest Warrior and I haven't played
it so I wouldn't call it new but
definitely want to seem like I know what
I'm doing right now I don't when I when
I compare it to the the vg2 for 8qe that
I have at home I love that monitor it's
super fast response time and and 1
millisecond response so on top of that
144 Hertz refresh rate which is really
like the major difference for me when
I'm playing a game this is what it's
2560 by 1440 I mean and 27 inches versus
the 24 inch Morrow that I currently home
this is amazing it's so much faster than
then what any other 1440p monitor that
I've ever used but I did turn off g-sync
just to see what it was like as if I had
844 Hertz refresh rate monitor straight
up and I I couldn't see the difference
and maybe that's because I'm not playing
around that that that sweet spot of 45
FPS and I don't know if that's just me
and my eyes or not but I couldn't and I
don't normally play with vsync on either
that's something I never do so that
might just be the games that I'm playing
and maybe the this awesome 780ti that's
in this this rig I at home have a GTX
780 so maybe it just needs to be more
testing I think Paul I need more more
time so you need to play the monitor
more really it's the conclusion here
conclusion is a more time with the
monitor you take another month or so I
could I could really hone down
thoughts on this okay well this is the
end of the video so Steve thank you for
coming and playing games at my house all
day thank you for having me and can you
think everyone and tell them to
subscribe to my channel and stuff yes

video from this awesome gentlemen that's
filming me right now and Paul's hardware

like this video because it's amazing any
they served me beer who gets that when
they get the game from Russia
I don't know it actually gives me should
come hang out morrow we should alright
cheers guys thanks for watching guys see

the ammo he threw at him and I think the
Box kind of hit him in the shins and
probably caused some damage</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
