walk as far when you're with your train
very confusing when you have to go from
Imperial to metric
either way it's a longtail nine-mile is
a thing yeah cuz it's all they're all
streets right and in Detroit you're
right not that I've ever been there okay
hi everyone and welcome this is uh this
is awesome hardware I'm assuming we're
live where we should be live this is
about the time typically when liveness
happens so hello and welcome this is
live show we talked about technology
tech are usually computers computer
gaming pcs gaming we stream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time to twitch.tv slash awesome hardware
as well as our individual YouTube
channels my channels Paul's hardware so
that's where we're streaming this
episode 186 side B and we just finished
site a on Kyle's channel bit wit which
is linked down in this video's
description
sure is so you can check that out
although now that I know that I'm
thinking about it I might not've it did
I update I did no I didn't put the after
party link in there I need to add that
I'll add that shortly anyway quick word
of warning we occasionally use adult
language we drink an alcoholic beverage
or two or three on the show as well feel
free to join us if you're doing so
responsibly and you're legally and
everything should be live on YouTube
doesn't say there doesn't seem like
there yeah it says real live on youtubes
on blue the no shit it says waiting
should be right are we live delete
system32 everyone no don't don't do that
someone's gonna think we're serious as
someone on the internet always does yeah
that's kind of strange because this says
we're live this is end to rumor
is that stuff mine says waiting for
pulse hardware you know what I bet it
might be stream deck the percentage in
the title no I don't know percentage
percentage symbol can really screw
things up every every so often huh well
we'll have to figure this out not live
consensus is no your thumbs yeah cuz I
can't see it I think we should be able
to yeah exploits exploits aim oh is that
it there now it's just it's just maybe
it's just too late right there see we're
like oh we good good all right
everything's fine alright just needed to
catch up just on a long delay tonight
yeah or something sorry about that guys
time I hope everything I've said up till
now has been recorded I'll try to recap
it real quick hi everyone awesome
hardware a live show every Tuesday
evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time stream to
awesome hardware on Twitch we also
stream to our YouTube channels first
half was on Kyle's channel bit wit link
to the description this episode 186 we
drink beer sometimes because watch out
for that stuff we're gonna talk about
tech news and thanks for joining us okay
a yeah and for some reason when we went
live today there was a really long delay
for YouTube to pull it up but it seems
to be good nap so we're going to proceed
forthwith with all due haste and such
not an exception things in such a nudge
quick plug for our stories if you guys
want to help support us and get yourself
some super sweet merchandise check out
the stores Paul's Harbor at net for my
store
I've been plugging this new new fun
captive thumb screw design the night
that I have different ice villain
hoodies as well as t-shirts and a few
other things we've vessel also got
awesome hardware merch mugs it's all
real nice bit width tech is Kyle store
he has these new screw with confidence
t-shirts I'm wearing one of them right
now it's very comfortable and also
so pretty sexy it is so which one do you
like do you like the Ã¥land do you have
the olive and the tribe one yeah I got a
roast I got both I got the whole set
yeah 100% completion so throwback now
Kyle's half of the show really aren't
you that's good there's a good time on
top of things today for some reason
you're good at this uh yeah I got both I
mean they're good shirts yeah very color
neutral matches with anything this
almost looks kind of like a military
it's a good color green a military you
should do a camo one digital camo was
ready there's so many options be fun for
screw with confidence although I will
agree with a few people who said that it
maybe should have been a Swiss Army
knives too dude we talked about that me
and John John and I talked about it
really yeah this is wider appeal okay
slow I repeal speaking of wide appeal I
wanted to give a quick personal update
here on the top half of the show because
I have some stuff going on in my life
and a lot of people have asked me
questions about it so wanted to give a
brief update on that first off my dog my
dog hero doggy I actually have two dogs
and here's the the larger of them and he
had a I want to say a medical emergency
last week it was actually on Thursday
and it really sucked what it is called
is vestibular disease which can happen
to older dogs and basically just it
happens and suddenly they lose balance
and they can't walk straight and they
get their eyes start to do a transverse
thing which is called nice nystagmus
just missed agnus
yeah I tweeted a bit about it but the
good news is heroes doing much better
there he is there there's I did a video
of his dismissed agnus you can sort of
see his eyes going back and forth there
so this is on the 25th which is five
days ago when we're in the car on the
way back from the vet we took him to a
specialist to check it out because we
were concerned that he might have had a
stroke or something like that
yeah had you ever heard about this
condition I was not familiar with this
condition at all okay
it's somewhat common that must've been
really scary then more recently
here he is we took him to the park a
couple days ago and he was super stoked
he's still wobbly his head his head
kinda leans to the side he's over there
right now he seems so much better now
though when I came over then in that
video yes yes he's improved he's doing
good Thanks to everyone who you know
responded I had tweeted to ask for some
support and the day that happened in
everything but just wanted to say thanks
you guys for that I'm like heroes right
here now he knew that we were talking
about him we're talking about him I
don't know good boy yes he's very good
boy though
second thing my wife is extremely
pregnant streep leap for extremely
extremely and adventures just update on
that no baby yet everything's still fine
no problems or anything just still
waiting just babies just chilling just a
game in time but should be very soon so
pre-emptive warning there's a chance we
won't be able to do the livestream next
week do you think I think it's like it's
gonna be between now and a week from now
it's animo sleek most likely a damn
likely most likely yes so that's a cool
thanks also to everyone who has been
tweeting and stuff about that cuz lots
of support words of encouragement and
everything you know I'm I'm I'm I'm of
course frazzled and everything I don't
know what's going on but well we'll get
through it yeah we're excited okay you
will get back to the the regular meet of
the show which is tech news so I'm gonna
dive into some some of this stuff right
here some you it I guess it's a lot of
rumors bouncing around this week
starting off with the story over on WCC
f tech about AMD rise in 3000 CPUs right
the third generation of Verizon this
will use Zen to architecture the the
current 2000 series uses then plus let's
just based on 12 nanometer mmm-hmm
original Rison was original Zen which is
14 nanometer now the shrinking it down
seven nanometer oh yeah and we're
hopefully gonna get a lot of benefits
from that cool we already know that Lisa
su will be giving a keynote at Computex
I was gonna say later this month but
late late in May is when that's
happening I believe on the 27th Kyle
will be attending coputex and doing some
reporting on that I'll be reporting from
home and hopefully you know with the
baby and everything but the rumor from
WCCO F Tech here is sourced from a
popular Chinese tech portal aha
specifically this website really Billy
Billy Billy Billy Billy this is the
translated Billy Billy article itself
about some information this is all
derived from people who various
motherboard manufacturers who have
already received rise in 3000 cpu
samples and according to those sources
which you know are a lot of them are in
China or Taiwan they say that there are
quad cores into CPU samples that have
been sent out to a lot of manufacturers
just quad cores so that they can drop
them into the motherboards that they're
developing so that they can test them
and make sure that they work right now
these being early samples they are
probably not representative or not
necessarily indicative of final retail
performance or clock speeds things could
change but even with that said these
manufacturers according to this rumor
which again could be BS this could all
be BS we've got to point that out
we're in the rumor area here but 15
percent instructions per clock boost
over his n plus and then plus was
already a 2 or 3% for IP C boost over
originals n so nice nice gains here 15
percent IBC improvement like it's like
oh my gosh are you Intel 12 years ago or
something like that
yeah cool but also potentially a 4.5
gigahertz boost frequency which is also
a nice gain typically is in two parts if
you're dealing with XF our frequencies
will hit four point two maybe four point
two five sometimes four point three
depending on the chip
itself in the cooling you have attached
to it but also like the XF r2 and and
stuff very effective at running higher
clock speeds and and and giving some
noticeable performance improvements with
gaming so shrink that down to seven
nanometer new architecture hopefully
this information is at least vaguely
accurate because these are all good this
is all good news
and it's also somewhat within the realm
of possibility from what we might expect
here that's pretty cool
the same report is also indicating that
the x5 70 platform because we are
expecting new motherboards to launch
along with the Zen 3 stuff or the Zen to
rising 3000 series stuff will
potentially offer 40 PCI Express Gen 4
lanes from the CPU and the PCH now how
many did x4 70 have you know officially
I don't I don't know off the top of my
head and and I want I want to clarify
here that what we're talking about is
potentially some something akin to like
what Intel says when they're talking
about their PCIe lanes so 28 right yeah
mm-hm 20 and I believe 28 was 16 for
direct PCI Express slots and then either
4 or 8 for like m dot 2 slots and stuff
like that and then there was another and
then 4 or H that went to the PCH for
connecting up SATA ports and and that
kind of thing yeah because they split
them off and intel has done some kind of
weird stuff with how they advertise the
amount of PCI Express Lanes available on
their main stream platform which in
reality is 20 because they have 16
directly available in the cpu for your
PCI Express slots and then they have
four that go off to the to their chipset
right DMI 3.8 whatever they whatever
they call that and and and that splits
off so they say oh well you could have
20 PCI Express lanes available there
that's what the manufacturers can
connect up but it's all using it's all
month multi-plex from 4 lanes so you
still have effectively 4 lanes
I have a feeling that's what AMD is
talking about here too I wouldn't blame
them for using that phraseology to
advertise their products Intel already
does it but for anyone who's looking at
this and being like oh my gosh these are
gonna be competing with thread ripper
and other high-end desktop CPUs with
that many PCI Express Lanes I doubt it
yeah
specifically in the article they
reference a leak this is what is this
from
it's a leak datasheet talking about an X
570 chipset motherboard which is listed
under the enthusiast segment talking
about the PCI Express line connectivity
they have broken it up to eight plus
four plus four which is a pretty
standard breakdown for mainstream for a
mainstream platform you have a GPU slot
and then maybe some add-on card slots
there's also a PCIe up link over here
that's listed as by for Gen 4 as well
then they've got connectivity listed for
USB 3.1 and SATA and USB 2.0 so again
this is this is talking about what's
going to be available on this platform I
don't see like some sort of crazy native
massively upgraded PCI Express
controller integrated into the end of
the CPU but it does seem like they're
probably going to be pushing for more
connectivity in than what's currently
available on an Intel mainstream site
that would make a lot of sense other
information in this article again all
potentially not true but they talked
about B 550 which I imagine we would
continue to be interested in as we have
been interested in B 350 and B 450
because they offer overclocking and very
very reasonably priced motherboards that
get the job done by and large for most
people without neediness Benz 180 or 200
and 200 plus dollars but B 550 is for
casuals or for casual users according to
the article and will not have PCI
Express Gen 4.0 support huh which is
probably fine because you're not gonna
need it that much because B 450 and the
amount of bandwidth of a
with PCI Express Gen 4 versus gen 3 and
graphics cards that can actually use it
it's probably gonna be less of a big
deal so I can see that as a
differentiating factor for B 550 to be
2x 570
we're also expecting B 550 to launch two
months after the X 570 stuff does late
q3 and potentially further confirmation
here that the a320 chipset one of the
oldest and lowest end chipsets from
Rison which I'm sure everyone who bought
a system based on the a320 chipset was
like you know what in three years if I
can't upgrade this to a 16 core 32
thread processor I'm gonna be pissed
that's probably what a lot of people
were thinking when they invested in
their a320 chipset
platform but probably won't support rise
in 3000 series so there is a small
segment of an for socket wielding CPU
computer users who might not be able to
upgrade which honestly again probably
isn't that huge of a deal although I'm
sure there will be still some people who
complain about it yeah it probably cost
AMD more money to add support for 3000
series on a320 than that would actually
bring in yeah I mean that and the fact
that those boards are gonna be so
cheaply built like at the lowest
possible you know support for everything
for everything in there that the idea of
being able to drop in some of these
higher end chips that are probably gonna
have slightly more power requirement at
least yeah that that's understandable to
me motherboard manufacturers are said to
be expecting 12 and 16 core parts so
further continued rumors that that's
going to be a thing which we've surmised
for quite some time ever since Lisa
first held up to the first rise in 3000
part chip rise in 2000 part where we
showed it and was like hey if that's the
CPU die with 8 cores on it and then they
is the space here for maybe they had
another one yeah just kind of weird an
awkwardly position so we're still still
expecting that anyway though let this
article's link down in the description
if you guys want to check it out one
other rumor that I've seen bounced
bouncing around although I don't think
it's directly referenced in the article
is that these products will be launching
on July 7th which would be 7 7 and AMD
has already shown us that they're real
hard up for that that that lucky number
7 since they launched the Radeon 7 with
the vega 7 nanometre 777 right super
lucky which doesn't seem outside the
realm of possibility to me that would be
q3 technically but I could see them
doing a bunch of announcements and stuff
and demos at Computex and then launching
roughly a month later yeah four or five
weeks later they don't in the past
that's possible but again still rumor
could could be not true they could
launch earlier maybe they're just gonna
close down completely and never never
sell anything ever again that could that
could be what they do next story and
this is just sort of a little bit of a
supplement to that one that we were just
talking about to show that hey maybe
there are some viability to some of
these rumors going around this is an
official statement from Asus directly
from the Asus website about 300 and 400
series and 4 motherboards and their
next-gen AMD rise and CPU compatibility
they are starting to list some other
boards that are getting updates and the
BIOS versions that will support this
next generation of CPUs so cool that's
that's that's fairly official now what
they're not saying here is like the
entire range of 3000 series CPUs will be
supported you know are there gonna be
some special class CPUs like those real
high core count ones that do have
special requirements we're not sure it
would be cool if they did support the
entire range I wouldn't be too surprised
if they didn't and you did have to have
some higher-end board or
the new generation to support those
really high court count ones but we will
wait and see as for now though if you
are currently rocking an asus x4 70 B
450 X 370 or be 350 motherboard you can
check this list to see if yours will be
getting an update if you might be
thinking about a CPF upgrade and I will
say for a lot of people who are on that
300 series like that's kind of cool like
it you got an entry-level
X 370 or be 350 motherboard a few years
ago and now you're getting a new CPU
that's launching that you could just
slot in there yeah yeah they're still
expecting that there will be
compatibility requirements for support
for certain features like for rise in
2000 series you had to have a 400 series
motherboard to take advantage of xfr 2.0
and precision boost overclocking which
are good and useful features so it's not
like there won't be any reason to
upgrade but for for some people who are
looking for a drop-in upgrade the work
it will be in the cards for some that's
cool alright moving on
Navi more AMD rumors also again from WCC
F Tech but they're juicy so we'll talk
about it this is actually a little bit
more physical because there's some
pictures involved here
these are sourced from twitter twitter
user Komachi and sukkah who posted these
pictures of a blue PCB which seems to be
that of a high-end graphics card now if
you look closely here you can see the
AMD logo that's that's in it right there
next to the PCI Express slot here so the
theory here is that this is the PCB for
a high-end graphics card possibly based
on the new seven nanometer Navi GPUs
that am DS Radeon technologies group
have been working on developing for
quite some time there is of course the
clear AMD branding on the PCBs
themselves granted these are just like
snapshot pictures that have been taken
so you know somewhat dubious and in
their sourcing and everything but you
know they look they look fairly legit it
looks like a gamers Nexus mod mat of
kind of does your right makes me want to
build a computer
these have already been analyzed and
analyzed and alloys din a builds I'd
analyzed in a build site video and
alloys didn't feel too much severe watch
his videos he goes over the PCBs and
talks about the connection points for
lots of different things so he spent 16
plus minutes going over that so feel
free to watch it it's links in the
article which is linked in the
description things that they have
discovered and been able to somewhat
confirm again assuming this is legit are
the GDD are packages which are scattered
around the the actual GPU mounted
location should be BGA anyway this is
where a GPU goes around here these are
all package connectors so these would be
ball grid array connection points for G
DDR packages and you can count up the
actual number of contacts on there it's
a hundred and eighty and that means that
it's GD GD d r6 so that wouldn't
indicate that this is a current
generation next generation products
there are also eight DRAM packages
scattered around the GPU itself so that
means it's 256-bit memory bus interface
which is also pretty common for a
higher-end graphics card that's
basically the configuration that the
r-tx 20 70 has there's some connection
points for display connectors it has two
DisplayPort a single HDMI connection and
what appears to be a USB type-c which
would be a virtual which would probably
be for a virtual link connection for VR
headsets also something you would expect
on a next-generation graphics card it's
got an eight phase-- vrm which you can
also kind of see right up here on the
top right I'm sorry the VRMs are right
here these is a phase V RMS build late I
think speculated these are each of these
BRM packages is 70 amps so it's a pretty
over built as power delivery goes so
probably looking at a 250 or 300 watt
TDP card but of course a lot of this
again is speculation based on just
contact pads and stuff like that very
top right here is the connection points
for PCI Express power
Dule eight pins as what's laid out on
the PCB but of course often these cards
are designed with all of those
connection points there and then it's up
to the card manufacturer to take that
design and integrate the VRMs as they
see fit and they can they can sometimes
cut down on that so it's not a guarantee
that we're looking at to eight pin
connectors right is the upshot of that
finally and this from the build site
video he looked at these connections
these these three holes right here this
triangle and he said he's seen this as a
mounting solution for blower style fans
and a lot of the PCB analyses that he
has done so reference might be a blower
style so it might be a reference design
with a blower style fan which which
which would can I don't know but we see
reference design cards of blower style
fans all the time NVIDIA has finally
sort of decided that that's not the best
way to go there's different ways of
looking at it oftentimes you can be like
well a blower style cooling solution is
good for specific scenarios so for
smaller form factor builds and stuff
like that AB Laura style fan allows
third-party manufacturers who are
building these cards to differentiate
their cards with overbuilt coolers with
two or three bands cooling solutions and
stuff like that yeah there's pros and
cons I think to looking at that but
point is Navi that's a little a little
bit more juice on that this this seems
fairly legit just looking at it but you
know we've seen you've seen plenty of
fakes that have been designed to try to
fool people but again a lot of the none
of this stuff seems like completely
outside the realm of possibility it's
not like we're looking at this and be
like oh my gosh let's get this crazy
thing that we've never seen before and
it's good 512 bit what kind of like
pictures that isn't that like just a
straight these are these appear to be
pictures of I think shrink-wrapped
PCBs if f ed yes if I had to guess they
almost look like they're black lip or
something like back letter or like I
don't know just kind of like the look
like they're glowing yeah these here's
the actual Twitter
most of it I think these are wrapped up
so like this is to PCBs next to each
other and I think they are in some sort
of plastic wrapping so if these work
because oftentimes a piece the facility
the manufacturers the PCB is not the
same facility that will actually do like
BGA mounting and solder reflow and
another other surface mount stuff so
this if I had to guess and if this is
legit it's like these PCBs are produced
in one facility they're being
transported to another yeah somebody
opened up a package and snapped a
picture up like I say so maybe that's
that's pretty cool thank God for guys
like builds wait till just like be able
to tell us from looking at it yeah a
simple shot like this is what
potentially might constitute that I up
and find his video fascinating that's
awesome
okay moving on VR VR enthusiasts now
have a new product to buy from valve
this is their index VR headsets oh it is
finally launched yeah well they have
announced pre-orders okay they are
starting tomorrow Wow they've also
revealed specs and we have some high-res
pictures and stuff like that so this was
not made in partnership with HTC right
HTC of course worked with valve to make
the vive original VR headset mm-hmm but
they're now going to be offering this in
what appears to be for four different
bundles or like a bundle or you can buy
parts individually it's going to be
powered by the steamvr platform so it
will be compatible with steam VR games
some might need updates because some of
the features are different in the
resolutions a little bit different the
full index bundle which is up here on
the top left is $1,000 includes a
headset to VR controllers to steamvr
tracking 2.0 base stations these are the
base stations as well as I'll require
cables and notes if you have the HTC
vive or the vive Pro you can get just
the headset alone or the headset with
the hand controllers
for 750 headset alone is 500 hand
controllers by themselves are 280 and
this will work with your existing light
boxes if you own an original HTC vite oh
that's cool
and then the Hat the handsets you said
the controllers would work as well these
controllers will work with existing HTC
vive light boxes the light boxes that
they are selling here though will not
work with existing HTC original valve
stuff
I see so if your light boxes broke or
you're trying to replace one or
something like that right you should not
buy one of these and expect it to just
drop in and work with your existing HTC
vive card where okay I thought there was
a picture of just the box at some point
here they're these these steam because
they're steamvr tracking 2.0 right so
the new headset and hand controllers are
compatible with the old light boxes
gotcha
so you can't save some money if you did
buy that old stuff that's kind of useful
blah blah blah base station base
stations are a hundred fifty bucks each
and again won't work with that 1.0
Hardware original vive that same
controllers differences though updates
which is pretty impressive is the
headset itself has two custom 1440 by
1600 LCD panels which is the same
resolution as the vive pro the original
vibe was 1080 by 1200 the difference
though and it because it is upgraded
even though it's the same resolution as
Avaya pro it's upgraded with full RGB
sub pixels instead of pentile so three
RGB sub pixels per pixel instead of just
two so that should provide higher image
image detail and reduced screen door
effects will not have the deep blacks of
led though since it is an LCD display
with the backlight so there's a slight
trade-off but you do get a higher
refresh rate hundred and twenty Hertz
with an optional experimental quote
unquote 144 Hertz mode which I think
will be pretty nice hi every you know
four monitors is really nice I am
you got him ran from your eyeballs
that's cool to the vibe in the Vice Pro
are 90 Hertz in case you're wondering
pixal persistence is down to just point
three three milliseconds I included that
because it seemed like a valid statistic
I don't look at VR stuff off enough too
often enough to have a point of
reference for that but there has dual
element lenses with a hundred-degree
field-of-view about valve is actually
not disclosing the exact field of view
index for this device because they say
there is a lack of an industry standard
measurement right now so fair enough
but they say it should be 20 degrees
better than the vibe okay so there there
you go the index controllers themselves
hey there they are
these were codenamed Knuckles during
product developments because they
actually strap to your hand which i
think is a good feature because in VR
you're so immersed sometimes you don't
want throw stuff it does feature your
basic per finger tracking which is an
update from the vibe controllers so
doesn't just sense your main finger and
trigger finger but it can actually sense
your other fingers on the controller
it's that allows for gesture support for
control and stuff like that the
controllers have USB type-c battery life
of about seven hours they got fun
texture on the and the wrist straps I
guess the headset itself has over ear
sound but they it's actually not on here
they they're near-field off ear speakers
so they kind of sit that means they
float they float like a centimeter or
two away a reef away from your ears yeah
like that no interesting I mean which is
the this review from upload VR says they
sound great and if it means it's not
pressing down in your ear like I'm all
for that and also since they're off year
that means you're gonna be able to hear
if somebody's next to you being like hey
you person in VR like you know right the
house is on fire yeah you can't see the
real world at least you can hear a
little bit of it yes so I'm all for that
- that seems reasonable yeah so kind of
cool new device IMAX
debating pre-ordering one of these
myself just because the video on it and
I do like the original vive and you
already got the light boxes hey I got
the light boxes I would probably get the
full kit just so I can do that but I
will see we'll see I do want to reset
the the VR setup and over how much the
original vive lunch for launch price is
like 800 where's it more than that
no I think your was 800 I think 800
seems yeah that sounds about right so
this is the full kit here is 200 dollars
more than that but it's you know a bit
more high-end you got higher resolution
yeah built in head news news special
features yeah okay
clipped oh says vive was 800 bucks that
sounds reasonable me too alright valve
recommends an nvidia gtx 1070 or better
to power this headset but they do say
that a gtx 970 or am dr x 480 will work
although that is a minimum yeah I
wouldn't a nose for entry-level VR sure
yeah connects to your PC via display
port and USB although you can buy a
virtual link cable for it for an extra
$40 put that RTX card to use man too bad
you got to pay an extra 40 bucks for
that virtual link is nice and virtual
link would replace the USB and
DisplayPort with a single cable right so
there you go everyone everyone by the
index do it just kidding of course
alright couple more stories you shut up
oh my god AMD has beat earnings
expectations look at this we're talking
about the stock market there no apparent
reason
that's what's what Sam do you doing now
look at that let's buy some today
they're apparently down point zero 6 but
now and after hours trading how does
that work after hours trading that seems
shady plus 1.1 to amd's revenue from
their computing and graphics segment
sell fell 26 percent year-over-year to
831 million they said that the client
was due to lower graphics channel sales
but was offset by increase
client processor and data center GPU
sales hmm
point is that they beat expectations but
just just ever ever so slightly which I
thought I had written down but now has
apparently disappeared from my notes
they they're they adjusted their
earnings per share to 6 cents beating
the expectation of 5 cents that's per
share of course really just barely made
it and they reported revenue of one
point two seven billion which was above
estimates of one point two six billion
Wow so that just uh justjust seems like
just by a hair granted point 0.01
billion is still a lot of money but you
know just that just just sliding by here
but things are looking better for the
next quarter
they're expecting revenue between one
point four eight and one point five
seven billion the analysts say they'll
probably hit one point five two billion
but again that's up and that's because
they've got a lot of stuff in the works
and then several big big launches coming
up soon right so anyway just gotta throw
that in the mix so AMD any of you guys
who were reading those stock markets
last story here and this is just about a
unique little computer made by a company
called Compu lab called the air top
three why is it sitting next to a render
of a hard hat what the hell's going on
at the front i/o
Brenna yo is very it's very important so
these are computers that you need to be
made in bulk for use in like on like on
location environments I mean it's like
you do you buy a bunch of these to use
for your company or something the actual
computer is called the air top three and
the unique thing about it is that is
passively cooled completely familis
completely fanless you have a break out
example of it here with a nightmare is
hey and you can fit up to 300 watt TDP
system in there they're saying which
means you can outfit it with a ninety
nine hundred K or future Zeon e CPUs
they can do it nvidia quadro r-tx 4000
and they're up to 128 gigs of DDR for
memory to MDOT to 20 to 80 SSDs and for
2.5 inch storage devices so lots of room
for storage and somehow passively cooled
how how hot is that gonna get I'm pretty
amazed by this honestly I would expect
it the they would the CPU itself would
reach a certain temperature and you know
ain't Intel it's been very cagey about
their TDP listings for like their newer
CPMs like well it'll run at this TDP
when it actually runs at the frequency
listed on all cores for an extended
period of time of course it's nowhere
near that TDP it's much higher yeah but
because that Intel thinks that because
it throttles itself to stay within
certain range that they could be like
it's 95 watt TDP and everything so
obviously you're not gonna be running a
99 hundred K in this system full bore in
the same way that you would when you're
outfitting it with like three hundred
and sixty millimeter all in one liquid
cool or something like that a little
throttle before you get the chance to do
that anyway most likely but still
impressive I would be curious to see
some some reviews on these formats of
these systems or something like that so
they're super and they're just super
compact too which I think was this kind
of fun just with some of the small
form-factor
builds you know several of us have
attempted recent yeah our quad row is
the only thing it ships with yeah these
are not made for like gaming they do
they do have something called a
err top two in firma inferno which was
aimed at gamers yeah there it is
oh wow passively cooled air top to
inferno this is from February of last
year
okay and you know it's red on the side
so their Inferno for gamers fast mast
again I don't know about the performance
of these this also just seems to be an
article on it existing not the actual
performance but anyway just one of those
things popped above my feed and I was
like wow that's that's cool really small
and I imagine in certain use cases very
useful especially for companies that
need to buy in bulk and have aftermarket
support and everything know RGB that's
true chats pointing out so obviously
it's going to suffer as a gaming
computers for that reason yeah
that's lower now alright well guys we
are going to and my hat is wow yeah I I
kept things fairly short I was going to
do a follow-up segment at the end but
honestly it's already 7:20
and we've got a bit a bit of after-party
coming here too so we're gonna switch
over to that so thank you guys so much
for watching my half of the show
try to keep it short and sweet again all
the articles that talked about are
linked down in the video's description
should check it out down there I need to
update the description with the after
party link ok it's there but it should
be live on my channel home entirely
thanks again for watching
thank you yes everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
