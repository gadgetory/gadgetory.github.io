hey everyone welcome back to yet another
Paul's hardware vlog this is my third
for the month of june in 2014 because
i've been doing a lot of travel and back
at LAX and I've just gone through the
super special security line that's you
might be able to see behind me because
my benefactors on the trip of their
lonely business class which is pretty
cool so perk number one of this trip
being business classes that I've been
invited to the STAR Labs lounge and
that's that's this fancy area you see
right here it can hang out here I think
everything's pretty much free I got a
bar over here some coffee get some
goldfish it's very important as you can
see the star alliance lounge has a
remarkable wine selection another
serving breakfast fresh fruit more fresh
fruit we got some some eggs and sausages
egg and cheese English nothing can see
I've actually already got some food but
I also wanted to have you guys say
what's up to Nick how's it gonna key
good this is a pretty nice place we got
here yeah Nick rights for game crate so
you guys check out his articles Nick's
also not to be trusted so that's just
just a worn there but here's my here's
my breakfast / lunch brunch I got a
banana some sausage one of these egg
things and of course a rum and coke
because it's a long flight this is the
special Skyway entrance that you get for
business class you don't have to go down
the same entrance that all the proles
have to walk down it smells like a
lavender and chamomile I believe the air
they they've injected some sort of soma
type great thing
it really gives you a feeling of elation
Oh is he board the plane yeah next we
have to go upstairs upstairs no not down
there thank you hello we're going up
these stairs hello 11k around okay Oh
fantastic lovely thank you so much all
right much space there is
this is this is the most wonderful
experience I've ever had there's just
space just space right there nick has
requested less light grew uneasy we have
these mysterious pouches which I will do
an unboxing of right now I'm guessing
there with some money in here all right
we have money I don't know what that is
ah a cleansing or refreshing cleansing
cloth okay clean yourself super glue dry
skin hand cream 224 dry hands serum fab
oh my god this is fabulous serum which I
let's make you smarter and more fertile
okay so we have the eye of the eye patch
here so you can get some sleep
toothbrush into space holding a
toothpaste just combed and then this ear
plugs of course you not have to listen
to all the crying game thing I'm just
kidding there's no crying babies in
business book hey they throw them out
the window and that's a lot of course
this lovely carrying case got your
reading light right here which is on
this like bendy thing so you can move it
around and read these seats I think like
fold-out totally flat so you can sleep
on them and then they've also provided
you down here with these awesome beats
by dre headphones you got some slippers
of course so you can kick your shoes off
the mark around the cabin and then down
here are the what I assume are the bday
controls so you can actually splash
water in your ass mid-flight I'm
definitely looking forward to that
loading onto the dining experience we've
just been served appetizer
and here I think this is like some
asparagus wrapped some kind of beef and
like salmon it's like a row
I've read
here's our second of course I just want
to point out that they've given me my
own little individual some pepper
shakers their house a little bit of
balsamic vinegar I don't know what this
little triangle play is for but had some
shrimps there's some bell peppers a
little bit less and then a cucumber
which has been kind of good i don't know
what
said cheese nobody i'm going to eat it
though
that might have been the dressing
moving right along we have some soup
also they gave us some bread and look we
got like a full array of silverware I
already use one of my forks because I
had a salad pork butt
I'm sure I'm going to go through this to
these as well I have the option to get
Eve's so I got beef look at this
obviously they didn't cook this on the
plane but still they got a nice amount
of pink in there
it's kind of a nice medium medium rare
this is the food you get after you're
done with your entree but before you're
ready for dessert right one last item
here is chocolate mousse cake
this I could still eat
oh and the reaction hello everyone we're
now in Korea we made it it's it's
evening here I think although it was
evening when we left she's also kind of
worried about Nikki first impressions
flying business class do you feel
superior to everyone else I'm never ever
flying any other way again I can help it
business class only it's only about like
twice the cost of a normal plane ticket
so we'll just have to have a mysterious
benefactor play pair way every time from
now on okay everyone our journey for
today is now over we have made it to the
shilla hotel as you can see they have a
very fancy chandelier up behind me it's
pretty cool but we're going to go to bed
I guess I'm finally revealing what I'm
actually in Korea for its this right
here 2014 samsung SSD global summit
we've just heard a bunch of people talk
about various things they've got 3d
v-nand now which is super super awesome
so see you get more capacity they're
going to have like two terabyte plus
SSDs you get more speed like twice as
fast because they eliminate the
possibility of cell-to-cell interference
more endurance like up to 10 times more
than SF up to 10 times endurance and
even more than slc and like part let's
power consumption so all all very good
things now it's time for dinner
these are fancy place settings I hope
they have like something exotic like
like duck or eel or he'll fat duck maybe
duck fedde le
Oh
hey guys and I've talked a lot about
food on this blog but we're at the
shilla hotel this is their breakfast

going to walk through this real quick
because it is absolutely insane the
amount of who's that they have here on

you the copyright their cappuccino that
good stuff that was pastries and whatnot

Charis and finally we are back at the
Incheon International Airport here in
South Korea we're at the the lounge once
again we're checking out the loungers
and excellent lounge activities on this
trip if anyone from Samsung happens to
be watching this video thank you guys so
much for inviting us out here to Korea
for the global SSD summit it was awesome
if you guys are watching this you should
all buy a samsung 850 pro actually I
can't say that yet i'm going to be
testing when i get home and we're going
to be having videos on newegg TV that
will have benchmarks and all that good
stuff but it's really exciting stuff for
the new 3d v-nand so that'll be cool I
also wanted to apologize to you guys
because I haven't posted many videos
this month I have been on the road a lot
i think i've been on the road more this
month than i've been at home so I'm
going on another trip of vacation
actually a little more than a week from
today so I will be got a little bit more
but after that I should be getting back
into the swing of things with regular
video content and fewer of these blog
videos which is all I can kind of manage
when I'm out on the road but thanks for
watching guys hit the thumbs up button
if you yourselves want to go and visit
the everland amusement park because it
was pretty amazing over there and we'll
see you all very very soon alright guys
before I in this video I want to show
you all a quick room tour stepping into
the room this is the shilla hotel in
case I don't know you mentioned it in
Seoul South Korea the room is pretty
awesome it's got this automatic you know
it opens a curtain for you right there
right when you first get in it's a rainy
night in Korea it's been very hazy on
the trip but you know what can you do it
to monsoon season there's an awesome
huge samsung TV on the wall which I've
not used one bit there's the desk nice a
lounging chair is the bed of course made
up quite nice it lik look at my hundreds
of thousands of korean won
I'm super bitch but the real the real
show is in here and i'm going to show
you guys toilet I know everyone's
fascinated with the toilets in on these
trips but look at that there's an LED in
the toilet at first I saw that and I was
like that's kind of weird then I was
like it's awesome because you can just
step in here in the middle of the night
with the light off and you can you can
pee and you know you don't need you
don't need anything so that's pretty
cool fantastic bath here which i also
have not used I've just been sticking
with the shower in there the shower has
got an overhead shower thing as well as
the shower nozzle so it's pretty fancy
there's the sink and there's me and I'm
going to finish with with this right
here so apart from the LED in here it
also notice it's got an infrared thing
right there cuz you got this whole
control deck here phone of course also
in here sanitary bag emergency you know
if you have an emergency in the toilet
all right this comes off right loser
controls for the toilet on the top you
have your flushes have left when I'm
flush to remote control for the toilets
gonna flush there when I first came in
here and I sat down it had like the seat
warming thing on I couldn't figure out
what the heck to do with a look at these
controls at the avenues then what does
this mean I so this is something to do
with temperature this this one the top
left also some to do a temperature I
assume this is like automatic
suppository insertion that's the
universal sign for bday I don't know
what the heck the square is maybe turns
the TV on while you're in there or
something this turns the fan on I think
I did forget this was a temperature up
here so you can tap that and then I
thought these are so weird boomerangs
and bulls but then I realize oh it's
just a left and rice i think i can just
this and i don't want the seat warm at
all i think this is like pregnancy tests
I guess here's if you want to plug
something in if you're wearing a hat you
press that button this is the all-around
button this is like must be double bday
right there so I'm
it's here are even fancier than I've
experienced like in Taiwan or Japan
that's that's really saying a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
