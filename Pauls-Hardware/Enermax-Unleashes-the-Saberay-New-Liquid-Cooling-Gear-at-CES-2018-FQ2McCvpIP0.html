Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool all
right guys I am over at Caesar's Palace
now and I'm checking out enter max they
are a sponsor of course so big thanks to
inter max for sponsoring my coverage and
they have see a new case some new
coolers even some custom liquid cooling
parts so let's take a look so first off
we're taking a look at the saber Rey and
this is actually a case that under max
has made previous in the past and
they've updated it they've had added
some RGB elements so you can see some
strips across the front the inner max
logo lights up and they're also just
recently adding a tempered glass side
panel not just on this side over here
the main side but also on the opposite
side so you get a full tempered glass
experience front back and sides as well
now this case they don't have a final
price on yet it's going to be in the
hundred and fifty to two hundred dollar
range but as you can see it's fully
kitted out with enter max fans those are
the TV RGB fans these are new for CES
2018 you can connect them up via a
standard four pin RGB header and they
are they look quite pretty they have
sort of three concentric rings around
the outside of the fans and from what I
can tell here on the suite they're
actually pretty quiet as well now one of
the things I enjoyed about this case was
the fact that you don't have to connect
up the RGB controls to the motherboard
you can do that of course via a standard
four pin header but they've also
included a control unit up on top there
so if you don't have a motherboard with
RGB LED controls you can just use those
controls up on the very top right near
the i/o and also up there for i/o you
got a couple USB 2.0 ports a couple USB
3.0 ports as well as fan control power
reset and all that good stuff inside
this case and transitioning to another
product is the lick the tech 2 now I
have actually used a little Tech 2 TR
for addition that's specifically made
for thread Ripper and it's fast becoming
one of my favorite all-in-one
closed-loop coolers I just think it's a
nice clean design you got a very simple
enter max glowing logo there and they've
added RGB to that as well and these
units are going to be available in 280
240 and 360 millimeter sizes the
smallest 240 version that we're looking
at right here is going to be a hundred
and twenty bucks for 280 it's going to
be a hundred and thirty bucks and for
the 360 it's going to be a hundred and
forty bucks
these do have compatibility with
mainstream AMD socket so am4 as well as
Intel sockets the only thing these won't
work with is the thread Ripper sockets
and that is because thread Ripper has a
specifically designed block on there
that's larger to provide a little bit
more contact area but if you're rocking
an Intel mainstream platform in LGA 1151
CPU or even a skylake X X 299 LGA 2066
you'll be all set with this cooler
moving over to the rest of inter Maxis
stuff here's a quick look at some more
TB RGB fans again new for 2018 and just
a kind of a closer look at the actual
LED design on those which looks pretty
nice they're also introducing a new
lineup of TB silenced fan these are TB
silenced advanced they've redesigned
these and they've added sort of an
aluminum ring around the outside that
actually looks pretty cool so these are
going to be less for your blinging RGB
builds and more for actual you know
practical stuff like making a silent
computer so these again a couple demos
running back here from what I can tell
anecdotally they're they're quite quiets
and since they are TB silenced you would
expect them to be very quiet and enter
max mix and really solid fans these do
maintain the ability to pop off the
central fan hub so you can get much more
in in there when it comes to cleaning
the fan out if you've been using it for
a while but overall probably another
nice fan option for anyone who's looking
for a really silent build here's an
inner max excellence case I just
recently did a video on this so check
that out if you're interested
but inside they've actually got some
custom liquid cooling parts including a
CPU block that's right there it's got
standard G 1/4 fittings on it it is
actually in an AM 4 configuration right
now so they do have compatibility for
Intel and AMD on those now they paired
that up with an EO changer which is a
reservoir and a pump at the bottom the
inter max actually designed this pump
themselves it's not an ASA tech or
laying or anything like that it's made
by inter Max or at least designed
manufactured by them and this is
actually the same pump that they use in
the liquitex coolers so it's a very it's
a very good pump it's also versatile in
this configuration they've optimized a
little bit more for liquid flow versus
in the TB designs where they optimized a
little bit more
or silent operation here's a quick look
at the 360 rad version of that liquid
tech 2 cooler for Intel sockets and also
it comes with a breakout unit that you
can use to individually control the LED
on the enter max logo there and you can
cycle through some presets and that kind
of thing you can't of course connect
that up directly to your motherboard as
well and use motherboard controls for it
here's an interesting new all-in-one
liquid core this is called liquid fusion
liquid everything starts with liq now
bear in mind guys they're actually
having a little bit of an issue with
LEDs on this demo unit they have here so
it's not going to look exactly like this
but these are addressable LEDs and they
have a very unique design here for the
pump block and that in fact they've
integrated a flow indicator into it
there as well as addressable LEDs that
go around the outside and they are
working with top 4 motherboard
manufacturers such as Asus and gigabyte
to make sure that they're addressable
LED software will work with this as well
so again coming in 2018 a new launch and
this is just another option for anyone
who's looking for a closed loop liquid
CPU cooler that also it has a lot of
bling going on now finally here is a
mining rig that enter max is set up and
you guys may or may not be into mining
but I know one thing Luke Luke really
loves my knee he's all about the mining
he mines the bitcoins and the dogecoins
he also mines aetherium and I believe
he's working on his own coin that's
called float coin it's gonna be float
float coin club but this apart from all
that this mining rig is actually powered
by a new power supply that enter max is
developing right now they said they're
only going to be distributing it
initially to system integrators but
possibly we'll bring it to a full launch
retail as well at some point in the
future this is made for mining because
it is very high efficiency it has a
wattage readout down there in the bottom
via an LED so you can actually actively
look and see how much power your mining
rig is drawing at any given moment and
then it's got a turbo button and turbo
buttons are just cool they're really
cool the turbo button actually would
just jack up the fan speed to enhance
the efficiency of the components inside
cooler components usually more efficient
and efficiency is what mining is all
about but guys that's going to wrap it
up for my coverage here at the NR max
suites at Caesar's Palace and Luke is
here he
I wanted to show you guys that he's here
because we always like to hang out at
these events and also just to confirm
that everything I said about Luke's
mining operation is absolutely true yes
yeah Wow let's what's the market cap on
the flow plane employment you know right
now we're probably speculating about 1.2
billion ok but in terms of like overall
coins that will be available we'll be
doing some pre mining but we're looking
at probably roughly 1.4 million coins
total nice that's very exciting everyone
go out and start mining flow flow
playing slow playing coin will play yeah
yeah well clean clean it's really
excited anyway a big thank you first to
my sponsors for CES 2018 enter max of
course deep cool cooler master and OCC
Toshiba I'll be back with more coverage
very soon hit the thumbs up button on
your way out and go check out the Linus
Media Group beverage as well thanks for
watching guys we'll see you soon bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
