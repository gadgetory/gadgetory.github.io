to you by gigabyte coolermaster team
group and Thermaltake hey guys I'm here
at gigabyte at Taipei 101 up on the 36th
floor they always set up here and it's
always beautiful there you get a nice
view but I have something very special
that I'm gonna share with you guys and I
don't think anyone has really talked
about this on video yet so ha gamers
Nexus isn't hardware it connects I'm
scooping you guys it's right here and
you guys may have already heard that
Intel demonstrated a 28 core processor
running at 5 gigahertz they showed an
insane Cinebench score but that was
really all that they shared I have the
actual system that was used for that
test right here and gigabyte was only
able to tell me a few very vague details
I'm gonna see what else I can figure out
just by looking at this system so first
off how is it cool there was a lot of
speculation that running 28 cores at 5
gigahertz would require a lot of cooling
they actually have an AC unit here
that's connected up so they keeping this
potentially below ambient that's all set
up in there and I can't get too close to
look at it yet but I am understanding
that there's a bits of power Block in
there it's keeping everything nice and
chilly thanks bits power for your
cooling expertise here is the sin of
edge score the run 7356 Cinebench points
on a single CPU
28 cores and 56 threads it's listed here
at 2.7 gigahertz but as you can see over
on the left here 5 gigahertz was what it
was actually running at I might be able
to get us them doing some more demos on
this some live stuff they said they were
actually able to beat this score by
doing some testing here but maybe I will
come back to that so the first thing I
think I figured out is that they have up
the game going from quad-channel memory
on the currents 2x 299 platform to 6
channel memory since there are 12 dims
installed in this system actually don't
think all those are populated these are
using those
memory that then some some dummy sticks
but they do have at least six of those
populated in there in order to get the
system up and running I can't show you
guys the CPU itself since its installed
over there but they do have the actual
motherboard that was used in that system
and this is of course a prototype a
mock-up but by looking at this we can
figure out a few more things for example
LGA 36 47 so this is a server socket and
does seem has anticipated that Intel
might be answering Red River with this
platform thread repairs been insanely
popular it was one of my favorite
launchers from last year and it's gained
a lot of popularity so info was like hey
we have high end server stuff maybe we
can create a platform for the high end
desktop for enthusiasts and also take
some of our existing IP our existing
work we've done on that and bring it
over so you're gonna have a massive
socket here similar to the tr4 socket
that we have on thread Ripper we also
have like the hugest chipset heatsink as
far as I can tell that I've ever ever
really seen on board your granted this
board is very oversized I don't think
this board is conforming to a specific
standard maybe an SSI CEB I don't see
those boards too often so I'm not sure
about that but we can also see 12 DIMM
slots on either side of the CPU and we
can also see just the most insane power
delivery configuration I think I have
ever seen I'm gonna count them 4 8 12 16
20 24 28 plus wood that's say something
around 28 plus 1 they're also
potentially some additional power faces
over here for the memory but yeah I
guess maybe one power phase for her
court granted counting power faces is
gonna be the end-all be-all for any
given motherboard they can use different
components in here that can drive
different levels of power but they also
have just a huge beefy heatsink on here
very heavy looks like they are using
copper fins in that and for active
cooling fans to keep everything cool
okay quick correction I'm being told
there's a 32 phase power delivery for
that I'm not going to go any more in
depth but I took some pictures of this
board and I
might send them over to build Zoid
finally for power delivery we don't have
just a single supplemental CPU power
connector we don't even have to we got
for either side of the board and spread
out I assume to help distribute the
power to all of those phases single
slots based full-length PCI Express
slots there and some other connectors
that I'm not even really familiar with
we got au dot - I imagine maybe they'll
be adding some m dot two or something
like that in the future - but again this
is an early board there's something that
they mocked up so they could get the
system up and running in order to
demonstrate a 24:56 thread processor
from Intel hopefully coming soon to an
enthusiast platform near you now I know
everything else is probably gonna pale
in comparison to that first reveal of
the 28 core systems that's I do want to
cover some of the other stuffs the
gigabyte has on display for instance
Oris memory it's RGB memory it comes in
a stick kit and they're going to come to
market with a 2 by 8 gig kits two of
these memory modules are dummies so they
don't actually have memory in them but
if you plug them in you'll still get RGB
lighting so if you don't like having
unpopulated memory slots in your system
then definitely grab this kit because
you'll get four of them and they said
they're gonna keep the pricing
competitive with other similar are you
GP kits like this the only difference is
instead of getting two sticks you get
four sticks same amount of memory but
all the RGB here's a look at the
gigabyte SSD UD pro series these would
be very competitively priced so in the
sixty to seventy dollar range for a 256
gig and they have a nice clean look just
a gigabyte logo a black housing pretty
standard SATA Drive but at a very
reasonable price gigabytes also getting
into power supplies they've done this
before but the difference this time is
they're actually manufacturing
themselves they're not going through a
separate OEM like see Sonic or something
like that
this is the Auris AP 850 GM it is gold
rated it's modular and it's got the
Auris IP or the Auris design on it with
the silver and orange so especially if
you like silver and orange and you wants
an all or assistant this is gonna blend
in very nicely and here's a nice little
mouse the Auris m5 it's got armor on
switches got a picsArt sensor it's got a
pretty cool-looking design it's gonna
have RGB lighting around the edges the
demo unit they had over there was pretty
smudged up and everything
you can at least see the lighting going
around the sides on the fly dpi
switching forward and back button as
well some light indicators on the side
to tell you what dpi setting your hats
for saying it makes you a scroll wheel
there and on the bottom you can pop this
plate up and it's got a unique weight
system they're actually scattered around
there so not just forward and back but
side to side if you have a hook or a
slice I guess you can put weight more on
one side or the other to compensate for
that look at this amazing view you have
from the gigabyte suite I'm getting
distracted alright let's continue with a
couple more actual products starting
with B 450 before 50 is a successor to
be 350 which has been the insanely
popular platform for risin and risin to
processors that was very popular because
you could get very reasonably priced
motherboards with the be 350 chipset for
around 80 to 120 or 130 dollars which
would give you all the functions you
really need in order to get a gaming PC
up and running before 50 is a successor
to that so it's gonna be out of the box
in paddle with all your eyes and two
processors and you won't have to worry
about maybe a potential BIOS update or
anything like that this specific board
is the B 450 horse Pro Wi-Fi so it's
going to be reasonably priced although
we don't have a specific price on it yet
and the upgrades over B 350 for this in
particular is gonna be the addition of
the secondary m dot 2 slot and gigabyte
has actually puts big old heat sinks on
both of them so if you have two and that
two drives that make it warm heat sinks
for both and those gonna help keep
things cool another cool feature that
you wouldn't expect on a more budget
oriented board is the fixed IO shield so
you'll never forget your IO shield again
because it is right there and it is
fixed there's also a quick look at the
actual IO on the board
it does have video out so it's going to
support your Raven Ridge AP use as well
as those rides into processors and here
finally is an updated horas X 399
motherboard so this is going to be
compatible with current generation
thread river CPUs but AMD has already
confirmed that thread refer to is going
to be coming out around August since we
are maybe gonna have higher core counter
processors on the thread Ripper Tunes
we're expecting 24 core we're hoping for
32 core as well I feel like AMD should
definitely do 32 cores so if anyone in
formaiities watching guys you need to do
32 cores I mean we showed Intel's 28
core over the
earlier in this video you guys need to
one-up them with 32 regardless of what
is actually available CPU wise though
they are going to need some beefier
power delivery to handle those higher
core counts and maybe even the higher
clock speeds too so to that effect
gigabyte his Edison beefier heat sinks
he pipe connected up here these are
copper fins on there which should
provide a bit of extra aid and heat
dissipation
there's also dual eight pin power
delivery up on top and even away from
the CPU socket every spot on this board
is filled with something we've got three
MDOT two slots here with the heatsink
covers for the two upper ones this one
is tied into the heatsink that's for the
x3 99 chipset over here as well and then
gigabyte has added a PCI Express
graphics power connector there to
provide some extra juice to the PCI
Express slots depending on if you have
those entirely populated or not this
board does have some RGB effects and
they've skipped going with RGB lighting
on the DIMM slots and on the PCIe slots
which I like that's lighting there that
they had on some of the prior boards was
just maybe a little bit too much for me
and also had individual LEDs here
they've created a bit more of a
diffusion and they have some lighting
effects down here on the chipset over
here on the ESS saber high-five power
delivery area for the audio as well as a
bit up here on the cover for that
heatsink and the IO this board also has
a backplate across the entire back of
the board which is great for
out-of-the-box build just keep the loops
protected there and also just looking
cool forest logo on the back there - and
also worth pointing out this board is
just insanely heavy that's - of course -
a lot of the copper that's used for the
heat sinks and it just being so
incredibly packed with features add-on
points and that two slots and lots of
lots of vim slots
finally here's a look at the IO tons and
tons of USB 3.0 as well as the USB 3.1
type C and type a connectors all the
gold-plated outputs for your audio and
then we got three Nick's
this one's 10 G these are Gigabit Nick
so you get two of those and then get a
10 gigabits of quanta Nick also
integrated there so if you're moving the
lots and lots of file
over a network that is going to be
incredibly helpful for you oh and also
firstly fixed IO shield there as well
which you would expect on the high end
since they've also got a lower end p450
boards now - because it's gonna wrap it
for my coverage here and the gigabyte
floor of Taipei 101 in Taipei Taiwan I
always love coming here I think this has
been my favorite stop so far because we
had some actual hardcore PC hardware to
share with you
28 core CPU from Intel some anticipated
upcoming thread Ripper to stuff a battle
brewing a war perhaps in the high-end
desktop space between Intel and AMD but
guys if you enjoyed this video hit the
thumbs up button and of course a big
thank you to my sponsors gigabyte Thank
You gigabyte for sponsoring my Computex
coverage as well as team group
Thermaltake and Coolermaster I got more
videos coming at you so if the thumbs up
button and we'll see you in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
