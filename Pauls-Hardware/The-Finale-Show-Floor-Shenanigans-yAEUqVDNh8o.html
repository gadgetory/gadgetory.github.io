by fractal design and WD to learn more
about their products and to say thank
you for supporting paul's hardware go
ahead and click on the spot sir links in
this video's description hello everyone
and welcome to my finale video for CES
2015 I have a lot to cover in this video
because I got a lot of footage at the
show this year I also hung out with some
awesome people so I wanted to start off
by saying a big thank you to the tech
syndicate crew we're letting me tag
along with them that's Logan McCain
Albert and josh AKA spanks also a big
thank you to kyle and his team for
letting me catch a ride with them to and
from the show in las vegas and also
wanted to say huge thank you to all of
you guys for watching my video coverage
of CES i did it differently this year
than in the past when I've done 25 to 50
videos I wanted to keep the number down
but still give you plenty of coverage so
that's why this video runs a little bit
long for free to click on any of these
links if you want to jump to any
specific type of coverage and I can't
finish without also saying huge thank
you to my sponsors for this event WD and
fractal design speaking of which we
haven't heard much from fractal designs
so far in this show but that ends now
let's go ahead and throw it over to an
interview that I did look Josh CES day
one before my voice was gone hello
everyone and welcome to my continuing
coverage here at CES 2015 I've made why
my way over to the fractal booth which
is Josh's hotel room yes yes so so Josh
first big thank you for sponsoring the
pawls hardware voyage to CES 2015 this
year I really appreciate no problem I've
made worse decisions but hey I'll go
with it if you're interested you can
click on the link in the description and
that would at least tell fractal that
you're happy with them supporting my
channel but apart from that I wanted to
talk a little bit about some fractal
products but but the idea that you guys
are here at CES and you're here and I
feel like you have a presence here hmm
but you don't have a booth yes so that
seems to me like you're kind of going
with this this whole minimalist
Scandinavian thing you're really taking
it to the extreme you are so mental
minimalist at CES 2015 that you don't
even have floor space yeah I mean it's a
little too grandiose you know we do try
and keep it you know Scandinavian
minimalistic ok we're going to like
stealth this year so I kind of pop in
and out of meetings so usually I kind of
check out once i get into the meeting
but i feel this way you know we can do
more one on one type of stuff i think
they pay more attention to you Paul as a
person excellent why I do appreciate
that and it's definitely a more intimate
environment here in the hotel room
speaking of which we do have at least a
fractal product here shall we go take a
look at it sounds good to me so this is
the fractal Kelvin t12 this isn't all in
one liquid cpu cooler but Joshua a twin
when you first talked to me about this
you seemed a little bit said and I think
there's a reason for that and that's
because these are not currently
available in the United States is that
gratis correct okay now obviously
there's there's issues that I don't I
could ask you to comment on anything but
I did want to at least point out to
folks that this is available in the
international more
market correct yep and so if folks are
interested they can seek this out this
is a t12 which is 120 millimeter
radiator you guys also have a 240 and a
360 and other models and some really
cool stuff about this it's got removable
fittings so you can you can expand the
loop and the pump can run dry correct
yeah basically we try to make it as
foolproof as possible obviously if
people are going to be moving up it's
kind of a product that grows with you if
you're moving up from say closed loop
and then I want to add on a video card
or whatever you know hey you don't get
the fluid bled right the first time you
know put the air out it's not to destroy
the pump it's not going to eat itself
that's beautiful well I really like the
features of this and I hope that it is
eventually available in the United
States God willing for those of you here
in Turners interested there's more info
on this on the fractal website now
there's one other question I had for you
Josh but I think we should move maybe
it's a little bit more intimate
environment
so Josh I know there's one thing you've
really really been wanting to talk about
that we the Frank will define our five
yes new computer case just recently
launched really has had just a massive
positive response to it so far and I
really know it's your favorite so what I
wanted to ask you is what actually makes
my video on the fractal define our five
your favorite thing well honestly I mean
aside from the fact that and I'm in it
that does help not much okay beyond that
no I I like the fact that you kind of go
through it systematically you're in your
garage because I know you are I mean
you're blue collars it gets how do i
presented a Dickie Chang exactly bigger
rocket I gotta represent the yeah yeah I
like all the videos like my children
well that's how you told me originally
but I think that's gonna repair for this
whole interview Josh thank you so much
for talking to us today and showing us
such hospitality here in your in your
suite oh it's just any sort it's been
fantastic right I'll turn that awesome
stay tuned for more coverage of CES 2015
we'll see you guys very soon and of
course WD was also in attendance at CES
this year they had a fan night which was
a lot of fun and although my time there
was a brief and my footage from that has
gone mysteriously missing I did go ahead
and pull some of kyle's footage from the
events totally without asking his
permission of course so here's a quick
look at that it was a lot of fun they
had WD ice sculptures and hard drives up
on pedestals and stuff like that WD also
had an excellent demo at the storage
visions portion of the conference I
wasn't able to go there in person but PC
perspective has an excellent article
writing this up i'll go ahead and link
this article in the description
basically WD was showing off a four
terabyte SATA Express hard drive that
also has an integrated 128 gigabyte J
micron controlled SSD inside by
connecting this via SATA Express they're
able to give a dedicated 6 gigabit per
second link to the mechanic hard drive
and also have a PCIe gen 2 by 2 link for
the SSD they're showing a couple
different demo configurations including
rate and it seems like a pretty cool
product hopefully coming out later this
year guys I'm over at antec now
take a look at this new case that
they're coming out with still in
development but this is the p380 now
look Logan Logan is here over my
shoulder as always comments Logan's
making lewd comments but I think that
really adds to the ambiance of this
particular shot here's a look at it from
the front as you can see the side panels
are off but what you have a player on
top or a millimeter click aluminum
panels these are very clean they're very
nicely done they have sort of a dark
gray finish up on top which looks very
nice as you can see they're using antec
fans inside which are going to be nice
and quiet to this is a side panel right
here I was just testing it out as far as
the build quality and all of that stuff
goes it's fairly rigid I also like the
integration of the window panel on here
as well it's actually a full piece that
extends all the way out here to this
little edge io is actually up here right
along the edge as you can see you got
some USB 2.0 a point oh these can
actually be swapped to the opposite side
if that is something that you're
interested in and then for the power and
reset you have them available on that
side and you also have power and reset
buttons over on this side too so I'll
let us know in the comments guys what
you think of this case antec is still
taking feedback on it so the your
feedback is very well desired we also
have the p50 over here so this is a
micro ATX or a mini ITX case that antec
has also dropped a side panel went on
from Devon to smaller form factor here
you can see we got some IO up front for
us to point out as well as USB 3.0 LUP
on the top as well power reset button
right there to reading your support up
in the top you actually have these
little panels that can pop on there so
this one is orange I believe this one's
actually when we sold it only leg but
they're going to do other colors as well
or if you want something more subdued
they got black of course and those will
pop off and give you a bit of air
filtration so on this side of the case
you have the sort of storage the story
power supply is going at the bottom a
couple 2.5 inch easy swap of bays right
there we got 3.5 inch base here to that
are kind of in their own little chamber
so you can actually squeeze those and
pop about you put 2.5 s in there as well
or you can remove this back panel with
the thumb screw if you
on easy access to those drive cages as
you can see there's a air intakes on the
side here so I can polarity in order to
push it back because there are two
included hundred twenty Molly different
fans are at their upfront the split
chamber design has proven to be a pretty
effective solution for allowing you to
separate the heat generating components
from one side of the case to the other
and you also have five acordarme up on
the front so possibly a nice little htpc
build I could go in this case that again
is the antec p50 I am now at a data I
hope yes that's that one right there
okay so let's start off for talking
about some SSDs a data does lots of
storage and sits in their name data of
course so this is a Enterprise Server
grade SSD and what they have done was
basically took an SSD which is very fast
but they wanted to accommodate certain
situations that might happen which is
data loss in the data loss in the event
of power loss so you'll notice all these
yellow little thingies on there those
are all capacitors integrated onto the
SSD so that if power cuts out any hot
data that's in the buffer that hasn't
been written to the NAND it will have
enough power to write that to the NAND
and you won't have any data loss when
you have power loss which is very
important in server great environments
Cain will attest to this my name is game
and I approve this message okay we have
a bunch of power banks over here a data
does a ton of these they're all quite
high quality so check those out of your
eris did more stuff over here more stuff
over here wow it's really bright over
here Albert was really interested in
these LED lights they're RGB he's
obsessed with them here is the thing I
saw at this booth that I was honestly
the most excited about now this is an
enterprise grade product this is not
made for consumers that means it's going
to be expensive but I'm still happy
about it because what you got here is m
dot to it son an SSD that's one friggin
terabyte right there and if you look at
the specs down here on the card holy
crap pci express gen 2 by 4 that gives
you 20 gigabits per second of bandwidth
it uses a jmicron JMS 8-11 controller
mlc nand flash but look at the
read/write speeds good lord sixteen
hundred megabytes per second reads
twelve hundred megabytes per second
writes on a single m2 SSD
spanx what do you think all right guys
and now over at Corsair they have Wow
lots of stuff on display I'm just going
to run over a few of them for you as I
have been doing on my coverage they have
the carbide 330 are titanium edition
it's been updated with the new front
fascia it's kind of cool there's a
blacked-out version as well we have to
100 are over there of course 100 are
silent edition that they're also working
on this is a new thing so HT 10 is a
water-cooling bracket that you can use
to watercool a graphics card now they
came out with it for the 80 to 90 x this
is now the nvidia edition and they're
using it with the reference gtx 780 here
this is going to give you a lot more
compatibility across the board because
as I have been told by corsair the
nvidia versions actually with the
reference design or with the custom
versions of the nvidia graphics cards
whether you talk in 700 series or 900
series they're a lot more easily
compatible so they've actually got two
systems running side by side here with
the HD 10 cooling it we're topping out
at about fifty nine or 60 degrees
Celsius and then we're also having a
full furmark burnin test running here
and you might notice that they're not
not much in the way of dropped frames as
far as that goes whereas over here with
the reference design we have well we
have much higher fan speed so it's going
to be louder we have a GPU temperature
of 84 which means it's going to be
throttling your GPU clock and then it
also it's running at 823 here versus 862
on the other system and then we're also
gonna have dropped frames in the furmark
test so yes water cooling your graphics
card is an effective way to get higher
GPU clocks and lower temperatures and
also less noise here's course there's
new flagship closed loop the CPU or its
h110 igt so the I means it's got all of
the cool stuff that the h100i had as far
as the Corsair link and everything and
then this is the GT edition because it's
a top-end one it's a 280 millimeter
radiator and then actually let me show
you it installed that's better there it
is installed you can see the Corsair
logo and blue there at the center that
is our gb so you can switch that around
if you want to
this is installed in the 760 T as you
can see and it's got a 280 millimeter
radiator going on at the top and also we
have a demonstration of course hair link
software going on where you can monitor
not just the LED and information about
the closed loop cpu cooler itself but
also other fan temperature fan speeds
and temperatures throughout your system
there's a new power supply to h x 1200 i
fully modular 1200 Watts 80 plus
platinum blue and black aesthetic and a
very nice looking car power supply also
you got Corsair link built in there as
well so it's going to be compatible if
you want to do a full corsair that
system and use course they're linked to
monitor all your stuff ddr4 of course as
well we have some Dominator pros over
here in course there has been steadily
pushing up the frequency that the ddr4
memory can run at we're seeing this one
running actually add about fifth no no
wait what is it dear I'm frequency right
now 1750 so double that up and what do
you get wait math math 3500 that's what
this memory is running at right now and
if the silver is not your thing course
there's also got this one decked out to
match the gigabyte motherboard with some
specially customized top pieces right
here here's Corsairs newest SSD this is
the neutron series xt solid-state drive
this is a 960 gig one very nice high
capacity and the cool thing about this
one is it's using the newfies on
controller that's going to give you
pretty much just about as fast of speeds
as you can get on the state of three
interface six gigabit per second and
every time I see one of these new fast
SSDs and they're on sada I'm like how
fast would it be if it was MDOT too but
i'll ask course there may be that maybe
they look into some m2 SSD soon because
i think that's where they that's what i
would be more excited about this is a
really fast one though so check out the
neutronic see you
for a new lesson sorry
the Chris's case always glow with all
No
ok
haha
guys I'm stopping by the monoprice booth
because I wanted to show you some of the
products that you might not know the
monoprice actually sells for instance
65-inch TV right there pretty cool these
guitars that are down there less of a
home entertainment center it's a
bluetooth-enabled and all that good
stuff monoprice has also been working on
3d printers which you're pretty sweet
there you can see it run out along in
there this is a dual extrusion a bsp
LAPD a 3d printer nine hundred ninety
nine dollars MSRP here's a
gorgeous-looking origin pc that they
have set up here very very nice job by
the origin ptc guys their mother price
monoprice does not sell this
unfortunately bet they have it connected
to some of their monitors i think their
monitors are the things i've been most
excited about lately so here's a 24-inch
144 hurts this is made for gaming so if
you're into high frame rate gaming 144
hurts for 250 bucks MSRP and sometimes
goes lower than that there got to be
bringing this up in a 4k version
eventually as well also got a 30 inch
led-backlit this one is also high frame
rate so cuz i refresh rate it goes up to
a hundred and twenty Hertz 2560 by 1600
30 inch and this one also has incredible
color reproduction going on as well you
get a full stand remote control height
tilt swivel adjustment all those good
things in a 30 inch panel and LED
backlit so nice and thin too sweet over
here we got a 22 inch this is just 1080
but it is a full interactive pen drawing
display the pen has disappeared so I
can't show you guys but this one could
actually sit in for like a Wacom tablet
or something like that it is that
precise it's also got 16.7 million color
support so adobe RGB support 2048 levels
of pressure sensitivity and a quick
charging pen over here is mana prices 4k
display this is the one that i already
did the video on so if you guys are
interested check that out
hopefully went into a fair amount of
depth they might also notice what's
going on out here that's in RGB keyboard
yes full RGB k board mechanical cherry
switches they have cherry MX reds and
blues available full RGB backlighting on
the keyboard and they're developing
their separate not to give lots of
functionality for changing the color
configuration and that sort of thing
Brett lynx is we got wrt 1900 AC dual
band gigabit Wi-Fi routers look how cool
they look when they're lit from
underneath this is a gigabit Wi-Fi outer
heel bones a little different this is
the 1200 80 the outer wear this one here
later this is a rider to see okay they
got out or they don't have any inners I
was looking for inners where LD enters
actually do microsoft they're checking
out the razor booth really quick guys
there's only one thing here that I think
you're interested in open source BR this
is razors you dead get that they've
announced just at CES it's a virtual
reality simulation thing it's basically
like the oculus but maybe it's even
better I just got done using the demo
models that they've got
they actually have a leap motion
controller attached to the front of it
really picks up your hand movements
while you're using it's kind of a nifty
demo I'd say that the graphics on the
machine itself are on par with the
oculus you can't get really much better
what resolution they didn't say I didn't
ask all I know is I'm more interested in
if I can see the little squares on the
screen and I can so it looks very much
like the graphics on the game we're much
very rudimentary they weren't very fancy
shmancy but although i do it at
functional I like this damn how much
border than most of the oculus demos
that make himself excellent he heard a
guy straight from Kane OS BR from razor
you
you should save it look more like Johnny
Depp how does he said we're somewhere
around barstow some around Barstow it's
this drugs me a tickle
11 stores
we're somewhere around barstow i use it
the desert the drugs begin eating also
there are paranora set buttons why you
guys dropping f-bombs on the video my
favorite thing about ces always is the
people that I come here to meet and oh
you that is you said if that's such a
cop-out answer as a sexy yeah it's not
the tickets the people you're with let
me see as usual event you said that
copying me because I okay continue
people you know what I hate most about
CST right fine I don't give two shits
about any of you motherfuckers all right
you can't all I really cared about is m
dot you drive I had this MDOT two
drivers sixteen hundred megabytes per
second reads and twelve hundred
megabytes per second rights is made by a
data had a black PCB it was awesome
that's all I care about okay all right
cam species members only it's very
different no it's not not really long
rich k more you shop at this is a
working person whose jacket this shows
that I'm a working class today yeah
blue-collar youtuber as evidenced by
your microphone haha so the workshop oh
yes exactly alright orphans you gave you
okay today what we're gonna do is we're
gonna mount this microphone on the
camera speed here if it's blinking if
the record light is blinking is I mean
it's on standby or is that mean that's
you should see a counter start oh yeah
right there yeah you've been recording
for a minute and 40 seconds alright so I
got call me rolls done he is it he did
good app tria what's up Lucas is this is
rolling right yep did you juggle Texas
you okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
