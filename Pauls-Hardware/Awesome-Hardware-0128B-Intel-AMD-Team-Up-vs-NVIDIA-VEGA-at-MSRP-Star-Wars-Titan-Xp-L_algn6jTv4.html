we yeah yeah should be live hello
everyone and welcome to awesome hardware
yeah this is episode number where we add
128 128 128 have someone's weight whoo
awesome hardware's a live show we stream
to twitch that TV / awesome hardware and
also to YouTube every week Tuesday
evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time and we
split the show in half so the first half
of today's show up so 128 was actually
already streamed to Kyle's YouTube
channel which is youtube.com / c / bit
wit like - that should be in the
description if you missed it on this
show we talked about technology
computers computer building life love
with speak freely and openly or means
occasionally we use bad bad words so
keep that in mind
really bad this disclaimer thing bitch
beyond that thank you campaigning us and
let's let's get right in the new the
show o we drink beer do we do oh thank
god you more thank god just a tame nice
5.3% beer opener go oh thank god a beer
so if you'd like to join us if you're of
age of course if you wanna drink
responsibly thank you for doing that
right now we're just we're just
finishing up the oktoberfest since it is
now november and we had a very long
october we had many awesome hard
roosevelt february we have five be at
five awesome hardware really yeah it
seemed like there's a lot of awesome
hardware in october the chief stakes
would be near good that jesus hmm oh
yeah oh yeah and if you enjoy nonsense
and what help support us check out our
stories if you buy stuff during the show
we will shout out your name at the end
of it johnson in fact cal didn't even do
his johnson's at the end of his hat for
doing at the end of my as it was so long
it's very long very it for your that's a
shut up shot I got I got
bottle openers and shirts and mugs clink
glasses it's all really high-quality
stuff check it out bit wit tech slash
store is Cal store he also tons of stuff
including new decals everyone buy a
decal and anywhere a bottleneck shirt
and an RGB everything shirt that will
make you sexy just buy everything on the
top row all those things I'll be happy
you'll be on that though let us move
into some technology news and starting
off with the the big news which is Intel
and AMD typically until an AMD are
competitors they they are they fight
with each other they hit each other
they're bitches Robles rival bitches
their rivals rival bitches bitches
there definitely comes in - they're
definitely bitches according to this
article from PC gamer by the way all the
articles we're talking about today on
linked in the video's description
Intel and Andy are joining forces in
order to create this thing right here
this basically hybrid model if system
with Intel CPU with a minute on you you
a radeon GPU with HP HP m2 memory on the
same package xiexie they made this video
we're gonna play look look look look at
that oh yeah look look at that look at
those charts wait that look at them
graphics the the goal here from Intel
and AMD is to basically creates better
laptops thin and light laptops that you
can take on the go with you that aren't
just able to do web browsing that sort
of thing but it can also do some some
gaming perhaps building a thinner and
lighter and more powerful enthusiast
mobile platforms with an eye towards
triple-a gaming and content creation the
product itself will combine a quart each
series CPU with the second generation
high bandwidth memory or HBM to memory
let's see you take GD
five can you stack it and it becomes hpm
that's that works stack that that
is functionally how it works yes also
you can see here this is a demonstration
here a visual demonstration of what is
at the heart of this chip the embedded
multi die interconnect bridge or emmab
look at look at the EMF going up mmm
let's see mm roit communicating that
removes the need for a silicon
interposer it is a small intelligent
bridge that allows heterogeneous silicon
to quickly pass information in a close
proximity EEE I mean if you're gonna be
specific or whatever but the mmm it's it
like the way it's been described is like
it's a way for different parts of the
chip to communicate with each other
right
the demonstration and some of the demos
I showed were like even different
manufacturing process based chips you
can have a CPU based on one process a
GPU based upon process I obey some one
process and you can still connect them
all together and how to communicate
right at a high frequency a high data
rate together take infinity fabric from
AMD mm-hmm I mean the basic concept is
kind of the same right I've been
drinking so I'm not gonna go into
further detail than that good what
people key in reducing height
requirements also cuts down on
manufacturing and design complexities so
that's kind of cool so the expectation
is we're gonna have something with like
a KB Lake or copy Lake style
instructions per clock
combine that with something like a Vegas
style GPU compute capability OD bad ass
um at the right frequencies it is quite
badass Vega is not known for its
efficiency because in order to make Vega
competitive Vega has been run at very
high clock speeds but right more
reasonable clock speeds Vega actually is
very efficient is this doing oh if this
is going to be vague or pleura spaced I
believe from what I've read it so that's
it's Vega but I'm not don't take my word
for that I could be wrong okay but the
upshot is potentially some pretty cool
power officiants and yet still
graphically powerful systems based on
this in the future there's really not
much more detail on that there's no like
scuse there's no product numbers there's
no launch dates there's no price there's
nothing so yeah it's just the fact that
it's happening and it is a thing it's
one of the few reasons to get excited at
moles yeah Bitcoin bitcoins price has
slipped below $7,000 everyone's upset
like why $7,000 what like everyone's
like wait horrible travesty wait it went
over at $7,000 yes it did that's crazy
Bitcoin has been on a bit of a tear
recently um let's let's go from 7600 to
flippin below 7000 gonna look at the
data
woohoo I only have $7,000 a Bitcoin here
is the current Bitcoin price so it's
jumped up a little bit those incest
7300 wait what 7350 is the current
standing this has changed like literally
hours yeah what so I mean basically it
makes this post irrelevant Wow alright
we're pretty much back up to where we
just it's still it still hasn't peaked
as high as it did before but it did jump
back up a little bit to the mid 770 300
this is like in the past couple hours
this isn't like what I was going to say
in this so does that mean this article
was written like here no so right let's
look at let's look at the last month we
should really get into Bitcoin money you
and I you can we could we could rule the
world
once my power wall gets installed and I
have solar going that I won't let any
extra power to mines and coins
alright so Bitcoin actually peaked at 76
hundred dollars on Monday that's
yesterday and if you look at the like
one week
here's Monday night Sunday where's
Monday
and this is the church wrong stupid but
I don't have any sick time you right
there yeah I'm seeing around 7600 drop
back down around 7,000 apparently it's
jumped back up another three four
hundred dollars in the past a couple
hours since we started talking about
this since I pulled this story up in
general but a lobster shirt bitcoins has
been increasing a lot I mean it wasn't
just a like a month or two ago it was
like four thousand and suddenly we're
seeing it breach prices even higher than
that however at the same time we're not
apparently seeing a an increase in GP
prices along with it which is which is
useful a theory I'm at the same time has
peaked just over three hundred and forty
dollars back on October 14th and it's
been around three hundred dollars ever
since so it's way behind Bitcoin then oh
wait I mean aetherium is it's very it's
I didn't realize it I didn't realize it
was that far behind well big hanging Vic
wins the stain of this kind of the
standard for cryptocurrency and theory M
is more say here's the peak of aetherium
but the idea is that the more there's to
think of it they're more valuable or the
the cryptocurrency is the harder it is
to mine right from what I understand not
necessarily the more people mining it
the more difficult to the mine effect if
if a cryptocurrency is value increases
then yes there will probably be more
people mining it mm-hmm
I just I wasn't sure like if you're like
the effectiveness of how much you can
mine is determinant by in some way how
many people are mining it or the value
of I guess it would be how many people
are mining it because that's dependent
on the value of cryptocurrency if the
value goes up then more people are gonna
be mining it and then it gets
increasingly difficult to you need
higher hash rate for to correlate with
how many people are mining a certain
see I don't know I don't know anything I
don't know anything about anything in
this aspect I I did I wish I knew all
the things there could be currency in
the theory even Bitcoin there are
relationships between those things but
it would depend on the specific
cryptocurrency
and how it operates and when it comes to
increases in difficulty and also values
to an extent that I don't want to try to
say anything something ourselves into
that corner good idea all right but
follow up oh yeah reason we talk about
cryptocurrency at all on this channel is
yeah related to the price of graphics
cards because the popularity of
cryptocurrency mining in general has led
to the increase in prices of graphics
cards and more specifically AMD graphics
cards
PCWorld pointed out oh this is from late
last week there are actually some Vega
56 and Vega 64 GPUs that are starting to
apparently sell for their actual retail
price or much closer to their retail
price this article is from Brad cherkiss
and basically talks about Vegas 50 56 is
being available for about $420 Vegas 64
is about 20 being available for $500 or
their MSRP their promised price from AMD
no recordings of the article the sudden
burst of availability is likely tied to
the gtx 1070 TI is released which i kind
of makes sense to me I guess but um yeah
let's take a look right now I'm gonna
refresh let's refresh let's look at this
change right now or cuz yeah this is to
change by there we're gonna look at only
new egg sellers look at that
back order back order
okay add the Kurt though sorry so Oh big
64 for 550 I can't get a Vegas 64 for
550 dollars right and add and you can
add it to cart and buy it it's not bad
it's 50 bucks more than the MSRP but
it's less than Add to Cart look at this
Vegas thing six Oh where'd it go mm
weird where'd he go yeah no point I
can't you get no pricing on my comic
look it's a my product Paul no age like
tantalize you wait refreshing well
that's not right can I add the cart from
here this is all right you have a get 56
from power color for 399 and Curt tempo
okay I add this to my cart
I'm gonna get will call in the City of
Industry you could pick it up tomorrow
you could pick it up to make it over
tomorrow it's gonna be all right yeah
let's look at all right so so that
versus that is a Vegas 56 that you can
buy right now for $400 grand reference
blowers I am impressed
all right let's look looks like at 64 is
500 sort by lowest price out back
quarter back order my bag are 500 bucks
this is amazing nice I can buy somehow
they're not completely sold out a Vegas
64 right now for $500 do it you should
do it you should just buy right now this
is amazing
on stream buy it no right there
school but the upshot is that's that's
good news that's good news at the school
cards are they're coming down in price
it means that hopefully the the
inventories coming back or they're not
just being all immediately bought up by
and suddenly these Vegas cards are more
competitive with the GeForce
alternatives like the gtx 1070 of course
now you have to consider an ad of course
makes it confusing yeah
Titan XP Star Wars collectible editions
have been from Nvidia Titan XP is one
thing where you don't get specialized
third-party versions of it at least so
you typically don't sometimes you might
get a water-cooled version here there
but most of the time the only
expectation goodbye is the reference
version so Star Wars collectible
editions are a much different variants
of that and there are two versions there
is the Alliance oh okay my the only one
that sliced the Horde and the Alliance
by the fact that this is a Star Wars
launch is this is it am I the only one
that finds this weird weird why is it
weird because one's the last time any
GPU manufacturer launched a flagship GPU
in collaboration with a pop culture IP I
don't know but it's Star Wars I mean I
know but artworks is owned by Disney and
Disney will will slap their IP on
anything that people will bet money on
are willing to pay exorbitant prices for
and this is no different Nvidia the
first one to snoozy is a big hell yeah
yeah hell yeah
turned a dog I mean II am on our Titan
I'm not saying I'm opposed to it I'm
just saying it's unexpected
I'm a very thrown off by this I'm not
used to seeing a premium GPU collide
look at least there's at least in
general including the display P there
still including the DisplayPort today
so that at least we can still be happy
with but we got the Jedi Order version
here which has a more distressed sort of
look and we have the Galactic Empire
version which is a bit more clean look
and hello man I'm feeling the Jedi these
have been specifically crafted to
reflect the look and feel the Star Wars
galaxy they contain hints such as the
hilts of Luke Skywalker's lightsaber and
light panels reminiscent as a Death Star
right there you go
I'm sure I still think the lights should
be RGB sure it is I still think it
should be are you mean RGB okay if
you're being 1200 yes all right the Jedi
Order GPU simulates the wear and tear
and battle worn finish as many items
used by the Rebel Alliance yeah whereas
the Galactic Empire gpus finish features
simple clean lines emulating the high
end orderly nature and of the
resource-rich Empire finishes that both
of these versions took years to perfect
there is of course specialized retail
packaging for both of these as well
specialized back plates with the Star
Wars logo these courts should make
lightsabers bet it into them they should
make way any bands inside here that
would be cool they should make lasers
and attend their under low doing
specialized retail packaging I'm gonna
be really annoying now GeForce
experience do you use the GeForce
experience I typically don't what is
that
really know so like Nvidia tears no I
know but no my I was basically saying no
I don't use g-forces okay I typically
don't either but no and if you are a
user of GeForce experience you get
exclusive preorder access to these Titan
XP special editions Jedi Order and
Galactic Empire Titan expedition so you
get like front-row pre-order before the
cards are broadly available mid-november
okay
starting tomorrow which I believe is
today turn into this article geforce
experience users can purchase one card
of each design by using their login
credentials
at the nvidia store they are $1200 each
and there's no information in the
article what happens if you attempt to
sli the galactic empire version the Jedi
Order version together I feel like they
would they would cancel each other out
or cause your you'd see the like when
the death star explodes that's what your
that's what what happened they I don't I
don't know or perhaps it would bring
balance to the force
yeah it could be that too I don't know
either way but yeah I'm sure we'll see
some we'll see some unique builds with
these GPS and then perhaps pretty cool
but again it's 100 bucks they're
definitely very high-end very collectors
items
I asked Nvidia if they would give me one
that's still pending rather pending all
right
did any of you guys have your internet
go out yesterday there was a nationwide
internet outage really it was actually
caused by a tiny error by one of the
major Internet service the Internet
backbone companies level 3 but the
series of outages included Comcast's
spectrum Verizon Cox and RCN the problem
itself was due to a Mis configuration at
level 3 and nots nefarious doings by
hackers or some sort of DDoS attempt or
anything like that it was just a Mis
configuration that happened by the ISP
itself so someone got fired as you can
see by this chart the red areas are
where people are really mad cuz they
can't watch because they can't watch
porn on the internet
that's my assumption there's ironically
the red indicates the blue balls
yes country completely and relatedly
level 3 the
Internet company it's an Internet
backbone company they're also an
enterprise ISP so they provide Internet
service to big companies and that kind
of thing word they were recently
acquired by a CenturyLink I'm sure that
has nothing to do with this the issue
itself was resolved in about ninety
minutes but went on long enough to get
worldwide trending on Twitter for
Comcast outage amongst other things
the MIS configuration was a route leak
causing multiple autonomous systems or
AAS units to issue incra net incorrect
information about the IP addresses on
their network which caused an efficient
routing and failures for both the
originating ISP and other SPS trying to
route traffic through this their systems
the route leaks can be malicious in
nature sometimes they're called route
hijacks or BGP hijacks but Monday's
incident as of yesterday appears to have
just been caused by a simple mistake
that ballooned into a national incident
I don't think I was affected by this I
wasn't either thank God I have frontier
BIOS firmly verizon fios but now
frontier Maus and yeah I went to you
that part of this it's been pretty
stable for me thank God which is good
yep
and no reason to have any love for
frontier as a company so far but syringe
Internet's been stable so yeah we have
AT&amp;amp;T so we were gonna meet them speaking
of AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and t-mobile they've been
in talks about a massive merger we've
believed we discussed it was a weird
what video but Sprint and t-mobile have
called off merger talks after months
four months they've been discussing this
sprint Corp and t-mobile us Inc said on
Saturday that they've called off these
talks no more discussion about the
number three and number three number
three and number four wireless carriers
in the United States merging together
together to provide a little bit more
competition for the likes of Verizon ok
this is the latest failed attempt
because they have tried this before and
both sides have showed unwillingness to
part with too much of their prize to us
telecom assets yeah hold on to their
pride got too much stuff don't let go
this failed merger however could help
keep wireless prices low because there
are currently of course the four largest
providers of wireless cellphone service
and now there's still four yeah rather
than three names competitiveness so
they're still fighting for consumers all
around so potentially better for
consumers I guess they did take the
unusual step of making a joint
announcement on the cancelled
negotiations which could indicate that
they're still working closely enough to
recognize the merits of a merger keeping
the door open for potential future talks
hmmm future talks sorry I'm trying to
annunciate have been drinking
I mean sprint is kind of like the
bastard of the ISPs the hell is this
stupid all right carry on all right next
up James report no no one more story
here know what news have any of you guys
upgraded to Windows 10 no why don't we
ever do that
that's quite a few people have but there
has been a weight upgrade to Windows 10
since the Windows 10 upgrade offer
expired it's using the assistive
technologies exception however this
exception will be ending on December
31st 2017 at the end of this year so
it's been more than a year since
Microsoft ended the Windows 10 upgrade
program that was on July 29th 2016 the
get Windows 10 program was which allowed
a very broad upgrade path for people to
have a free upgrade from Windows 7
Windows 8 Windows XP even you could do
but since that ended there has been this
assistive technologies loophole if you
were
one who needed to use assistive
technologies which is something as
simple as pulling up the on-screen
keyboard on Windows you were still
eligible for this upgrade which
basically meant that anyone who is aware
of this and knew the proper procedures
to go through it still get an upgrade to
Windows 10 is a major loophole basically
a loophole yes yeah something that was
there injured but it's sending deaf or
blind there you go
yeah you have to kind of pretend that
you need the assistive technologies in
order to do it but sometime just in this
past week Microsoft has quietly edited
edited their faq page about this the
heading originally said we will make a
public announcement prior to ending this
offer and now that text has been
replaced and reads the accessibility
upgrade offer expires on December 31st
2017 that's the NF I've seen as in this
image here okay yeah if you were
interested and still hadn't taken
advantage of an upgrade from a prior
version of Windows to the current
version of Windows 10 and you're
interested then maybe this is something
you still want to do there is a link to
this ZDNet article in this video's
description and there's a link in that
ZDNet article to how to actually go
about doing this I'm not gonna describe
how to do it to you here but it's not
very difficult cool and if you have a
system that's using a an earlier version
of Windows and you want to upgrade it
for free you should probably do that now
if you don't that's okay there's plenty
of people who are like I love Windows 7
and don't like the Windows 10 stuff
organo screw that there's a slightly
smaller groups it's like I love Windows
8 tonight Oh Windows 10 stuff I don't
quite understand them probably they want
to use the
the TV streaming features all right
let's move on to games report games
reports yes the games are portal because
there's somebody new there this is some
gaming news a little steam news here and
of course Blizzcon was just this weekend
so Blizzard yeah yeah did have several
of us she's far away from us about that
yeah it was very close but I didn't go
do it so the steam hardware survey has
recently been published and this article
is pointing out not just some of the
steam hardware survey results but also
that Windows has stopped updating its
official Windows market share page which
they had been using in the past to say
like hey look how good Windows 10 is
doing but they weren't able to tweak
their numbers enough to be like hey look
how good Windows tends to me so they
just stopped updating it their article
point outs there's still three other
ways you can possibly see how Windows 10
is doing overall as an operating system
stat counters latest update net market
shares figures or of course the steam
monthly user survey which is a very good
way of looking at people who are
actually playing PC games and all that
I'm gonna open up the actual link right
here so we can look at some tricks look
at these charts look for marinho hey
charts which are usually why can't I get
a bigger look at the church how can this
click click for more info I can't look
at and what does she look at the details
the defect rates bigger anyway for
October 2017 the steam hardware hardware
survey did seem to have a pretty big
shift in that Windows 7 gained twenty
one point four seven percentage points
this month
climbing to sixty five point four seven
percent of the share of operating
systems used however well you might look
at that and be like wow
when does ten sucks because Windows 10
did shed seventeen point three eight
percentage points to get it to twenty
eight point six percent market share
there is another fact
here if you look at the language section
of the survey simplified Chinese surged
twenty six point eight three percentage
points to fifty six point three seven
percent in October while English fell
thirteen point four to twenty one point
two four percent so the sir the article
is surmising that this big boost in
people participating in the steam
hardway service Hardware survey from
China using Windows 7 is what's causing
this shift it's not necessarily a bunch
of people who have been like you know
Windows 10 sucks I'm gonna roll back to
Windows 7 or something like that people
who are already on Windows 7 and they're
all from China apparently it's more
people in China using Windows 7 I don't
know what version of Windows 7 they're
using I don't know if it's attacked hack
Windows 7
but definitely is an interesting shift
to look at if you're looking at hardware
service beyond that though of course
Blizzcon was just this past weekend and
Blizzard announced quite a few things
I'm gonna talk about the things I was
most interested in all right starting
with vanilla well servers vanilla Wow
sir but no Wow does that mean that
they're not they're not monitored or
touched by Blizzard themselves what does
that mean by vanilla Blizzard servers or
they have no regulation or so World of
Warcraft
launched the beta launched in 2003
mm-hmm
the beta was open for a bit I don't know
when it actually went from beta to not
beta but vanilla WoW is original Wow it
is the version of World of Warcraft that
existed in 2004 or 2005 okay
early on and the developments of the
game because the game of course has been
a game that's evolved over time over the
past
what is it 2017 2003 for
ten years so what made it not vanilla
anymore so what made it not vanilla and
actually I'm not a high percent sure
about that that's actually a pretty good
question what what really made it not
vanilla was the launch of the first
expansion the first expansion was first
expansion was was Burning Crusade okay
and a lot of people to go into Outland
and yeah the Burning Crusade thank you
Thank You Chet so that was the first
expansion so when you first played World
of Warcraft and you're how to created a
character and he leveled it up you can
get up to level 60 uh-huh
when they released the first expansion
Burning Crusade up to 90 right there's a
new continent you could go to like a new
planet whatever you get a completely new
area right and you could level up to
level 70 okay they've released
subsequent expansion packs after that
though of let you low let go go to level
80 uh-huh and then level 90 and there's
like a 95 in there I think and then a
hundred okay and this expansion that
they've just the the most recent
expansion that I talked about just this
weekend is gonna let people get up to
level 120 okay and there's new
continents and there's a horde versus
Alliance renewal there has to be more to
this vanilla nonfat vanilla thing than
just the maximum level you can reach her
yes I mean there's been tons of changes
to the game over the years and the UI
functionally the way it works there's a
of course been a bunch of changes under
the hood that people aren't aware of as
far as how the game functions itself so
for a long time I haven't even since
Burning Crusade there's been a lot of
people who were like I liked how it was
and vanilla I like the original version
there were a lot of stuff that was more
challenging there's different stuff that
they've done over the years that a lot
of people have looked at and said like
you did this so that made the game
easier to make more people come and play
the game cuz it's easier and that
simpler and now it's easier for the
noobs and there's more noobs
all that kind of stuff so vanilla is the
original game his love differences love
stuff that people are accustomed to now
that didn't wasn't how it worked back 10
to 12 to 14 years ago yeah but there's
enough people who have been interested
in playing that game at its original
form and there's been enough people at
Blizzard who recognize World of Warcraft
as not just a video game but a one of
the first massively popular mmo's a
video game changed a lot of the way that
people play video games in general a
video game had one of the largest player
bases at least in the United States
especially when it comes to a paid game
right so there's a lot of sort of world
firsts I guess so you might say that
world's aircraft had so there's a lot of
interests both from the community as
well as I would imagine from the
developers of the game itself so be like
alright this original game that we
created back in 2004-2005 we can't just
make that again right now but wouldn't
it be cool if we could so this is what
they have promised people that they
would actually do now there's been
attempts to do this in the past over the
past year nostalrius was a sort of a
rogue independent server that had a
vanilla version of wow that they had
built themselves Blizzard has at times
seemed like more of an aggressor going
after these independently created realms
that people like to play in but at the
same time there is some understanding of
them like they have to protect their
intellectual property and that kind of
thing sure but the article and if you
guys want to read it it's linked in the
description PC gamer is a fairly
in-depth interview with J Allen Brock
who is the vice president and is
executive producer of Wow
he talks about vanilla while servers the
announcement at Blizzcon as well as some
of the issues that they've had to
attempt to overcome when it comes to
even addressing something like can they
make vanilla servers he said the
original problem
that we would have to run to mmo's
essentially we'd have to run classic
well and then we'd have the current
while at the same time classic Wow and
current while don't really work in the
same way anymore
classic Wow has all kinds of bugs and
problems it also has all kinds of
exploits and hacks that everyone already
knows about because that's you know 10
or 10 to 15 years old the problem goes
down to the base level programming at
hardware that vanilla world of warcraft
used in 2003 but Rock says this team has
made a breakthrough and we think we have
a way to run the classic servers on the
modern modern technical infrastructure
hmm and my assumption here is that it
potentially has a decent amount to do
with instancing which is something that
they've done a lot over time when it
comes to themselves as well as
instancing specific areas and they've
made a lot of advances over time in that
the expansion with death Knights was a
big step for Dan that is like cuz I'm
totally out of the loop but as someone
who used to play Wow regularly does this
move entice you to jump back into the
game potentially okay because there's a
lot of nostalgia there so it's an
attempt to try to separate the nostalgia
from reality but it's also one of those
things where like you know 10 years ago
I might have had a different sort of
daily schedule as far as my ability to
play video games that kind of thing but
yeah I have often said I've said before
that the number of people playing World
of Warcraft and the community that was
involved was an experience that I feel
like I haven't had or seen recreated
since that existed and Warcraft back
when I was playing regularly yeah and it
was a really really cool experience just
to have that many people invested
playing a game all at the same time you
can get together to play with on quests
and do that kind of thing
yeah it's pretty cool so um the prospect
of World of Warcraft and the vanilla
which is more challenging which and
requires more investment of time which
has high-level raids and that kind of
thing that were only unlocked by the
most elite of guilds back in 2005 2006
2007 nessam they being available again I
think has a lot of potential you know o
has a lot of people might be time for
you to create a new guild
possibly it is pointed out in the
article that there's a lot of
advancements that have been made such as
crossrealms servers looking for raid
dungeon finder automatic party
matchmaking that has been integrated
into the game that isn't is it wasn't
there with vanilla and isn't going to be
there for the new version that comes out
they didn't meet directly with Asterius
the private server team that created the
vanilla WoW server that was incredibly
popular before it got shut down by due
to actions by Blizzard but nestorius
actually turned over its code to
Blizzard in order to play with it and
pick at it and see what they had
accomplished so yeah it certainly seems
like Blizzard has taken a lot of time
and a lot of thought about this but yeah
they despite all of the changes that
have happened over the years
specifically quoted in the articles like
casting an intellect buff you have to
cast the buff and then drink to get your
mana back up before you could cast it
again
and they realize like that was a stupid
thing like yeah you should just feel the
casting casts it like you shouldn't take
that much mana but it did back in the
day and sure you're gonna have to do
that again if you go back to the world
the original vanilla version so lots
little details about that that people
probably have maybe taken for granted
over the years but we'll see how it
actually goes but Blizzard says if
millions of people show up and play for
years that's awesome if just tens of
people show up and play for years we're
fine either way they're going to support
it hopefully we'll see something along
these lines in 2018 and we're gonna
argue about this in just a second
actually let's post that right now all
right we make it vanilla long kills well
I
several my my wife and several other
people have already asked me about this
since this is a potential thing that's
coming soon and I have thought about it
and I've been like you know what it's an
investment of time that you kind of have
to think about beforehand is it
something that we should sort of like I
don't know live stream and play games
and that kind of thing
if you guys are interested and want to
vote on that please go ahead and do so I
personally have to say yes wait now
we're not answering it oh we're not
answering it I've one thing to talk
about okay go ahead
well people argue on that also some news
from Blizzcon Starcraft 2 which is a
really really good RTS game very well
made very well balanced is going or tier
free-to-play launched seven years ago in
2010 Wow just kind of crazy to think
about as well free-to-play going for you
to play now really free-to-play yes by
Starcraft 2 anymore
why does download and play what they've
gotten so much they they've actually
want more people to play the game and
that's the type of game you play and get
better at and get interests in this
playing MMO MMO but arts yes but play
against other people online portion
significant portions of single and
multiplayer content for no charge will
be available starting November 14th
players will be able to download wings
of Liberty the original campaign for
free if you're previously paid for wings
of Liberty and you have an account on
battlenet you'll be able to get the
heart of the swarm expansion for free
instead and if you previously have paid
for all the expansions like I have for
example you're going to get an exclusive
ghost skin and three new portraits which
nice it's not exactly like getting my
money back but okay blows heard at least
you did something content players will
also be able to earn full free access to
ranked multiplayer play including units
from all three of the games expansions
that mode will be locked until players
notch a single unranked or eight I win
on ten separate days and that's just an
example of one of blizzards things that
they have accepted to be
and they sort of flock out as far as
play play through a balance between you
can do this much to get to the next
level or you can just pay us some money
yeah they usually reasonable with that
like story craft to so competitive that
I would never be able to survive they're
gonna be online they're gonna continue
to make money off Starcraft 2 by selling
co-op commanders additional
single-player campaigns at $15 each or
$40 for bundles 3 and other premium
upgrades like announcer packs special
skins and war chests well cool yeah for
all the die-hard Starcraft 2 players out
there yeah I can't why I don't think I
actually finished this start kind of two
campaigns so did that look a lot of
diehard players for Starcraft 2 mainly
played the online just to play against
other people linked like any of the
battlefield are cold yeah yeah a big
part of no one plays the campaign you
just go straight into multiplayer and
kill people yeah stuff I mean if you
want to if you want to hunt the most
dangerous game you have to play against
a fellow human that's part of it okay
the only worthy opponent let's see what
I'm the right thing what do you guys
think about making a vanilla WoW guild
vanilla WoW guild ah cold where I think
that's sold it from oh just to call it
awesome poured where is some gold that
would be pretty clutch internet gold
because you have to create it now
because you know cuz you know we're
playing hard
we're not playing Alliance Alliance
Alliance but I feel like the one the
right side for the Horde but I feel like
them that is a pretty significant amount
of people who feel that we should make
awesome awesome hardware and thanks for
all of your responses and Matt yes we
have one last segment oh oh do we know
we don't that was a sorry we forgot
airing it was like oh nevermind it's
fine I heard Becca
$5 you a hall do you
do you know when the coolant from your
arctic panther build will be available
to buy I'm putting together a cart for
liquid builds should I wait I don't know
I don't know the answer to that question
I'm sorry
it's from primo chill it's it's they're
still developing it but mine had the
unique situation that I it was White's
and then it turned blue I think because
of some and then it we're Brody back to
white yeah and then it's back to white
now which I'm just like why okay forget
it
it's very rich for amazing real right
there oh that's great yeah I would I
would try it's waiting to that primo
chill yeah maybe they can give you a
better idea of when it's actually gonna
be available for my at retail okay cuz
this is a this is early stuff and I was
using it in a not normal manner but it's
still been pretty cool it's so it still
looks really cool texture that's in
there oh yeah is freaking awesome and
cool it looks even better in person
jujubee's $13.30 loops Paul from
Movember here's your share
oh thank you or you did the Movember
thing move it yeah that's what I'm
working on yep me too

bucks
Paul the beers on point Kyle I'm looking
to you I'm looking to up the hare game
what products do you use I do not really
use much of any product don't put
anything in your hair I occasionally
will use just like that I have like this
sort of wax that I'll use right when my
hair is cut like that that week that my
hair is freshly cut I'll actually style
my hair with product
but other than that I never use product
should I wish to fancy I wish I was more
fashionable to give you actual advice
all right Scott Dilbeck six dollars and
sixty six cents cheers favorite 90s game
console do you remember graphics blowing
your mind
nice game was game cute a station those
games was Gamecube before mean dozen 90s
I think it was probably after but I
would say PlayStation for sure
PlayStation 2 I don't even know I like
the years all blur together PlayStation
1 I mean for me with Final Fantasy 7 and
that was the same thing was he was a
thing does anything for me with n64 a
significant period of time I mean good
information to wait when did GTA there
was GTA there's like GT 110 there was
bison because III was in PlayStation 2
I think PlayStation 2 was the first like
current were like the the way GTA is now
like with right dude well you still had
like a 3d environment on PlayStation 1
but there was no GTA the way we know it
now on that platform until PlayStation 2
please introduce what you choose to
create and then on PlayStation 2 see it
right - I guess location - yes that I
know n64 completely blew my mind when I
played like Mario like Super Mario 64
for the first time I mean imagine going
from SNES when you're playing like USU's
island like Super Mario
Brothers and stuff
two-dimensional it's all 2d all you've
ever known going to n64 we were playing
Super Mario Brothers and like 64 it was
just
and then like games like I want to I
want to save PlayStation 1 though
perfect dark original PlayStation God
original PlayStation Final Fantasy 7 and
original Final Fantasy 7 was the
first game in existence to ever have a
televised commercial really yeah it was
the first video game in existence to
actually be advertised on subversion all
right but Final Fantasy 7 I want to say
twisted metal twisted metal with
originals of original twisted metal on
the original PlayStation yeah it was a
classic
I feel like that was my freshman year of
college so good it was so good freshman
year of college as PlayStation yeah I
played a lot like senior year to know
that I'm Oh - now you know I get the
more I can relate to you that oh I know
it's like it's like as we get yes to be
you're younger than me I know but as you
get older I feel like we're on Stephen
Hill ten bucks
this is another donation no this is just
a tribute this hot tribute I like that -
thank you very much man
Jesse fish five bucks what do you
suggest for GPU since there are so many
of us have experienced this problem the
little blue pill isn't helping we need
to price a price yeah there's a ballpark
for you Jesse mm-hmm I still say that
the GTX 1070 at $400 yeah is this deal
right now is kind of good it's good bang
for your buck range
that'll actually like last you another
couple years yeah that can handle the
high resolutions and stuff yeah it's
hard to say
Zachary Hummel Zaki boxy dollars y'all
won an in win 509 faces of prime X 370
with the shiner the currently collecting
dust and making my girlfriend man what
what I mean making your girlfriend mad
can come here and make my wife mad tell
there's a build a damn PC with those
components yeah I feel like there's
people who don't have lots of hardware
lying around to could make better use of
that stuff than us yeah
but if it's gonna go on the recycling
otherwise and sure why not
Thank you Thank You Zack bill yep
appreciate it replies Giovanni
five bucks 3.5 gigabytes 1080 is thanks
another question do cache latency times
make a visible difference to the average
user or only in benchmarks how big if so
to my knowledge typically its match
latency is negligible not especially
when it comes to like work station or
even gaming applications I mean if
you're comparing two and they're vastly
off if you're looking at like cats
latency 14 versus cat Satan's eat 20 or
something like that's a big difference
but usually they're they're much smaller
differences in that and that's it's
negligible I'd say speeds when it comes
to DRAM matters most when you're going
with a risin platform you want to make
sure to have a pretty fast Ram kit with
your risin system usually anything like
20 29 33 or above would be advised if
you are gonna be sliding horizon chip in
there otherwise I feel like on Intel
platforms speed like actual frequency
and cache latency doesn't matter as much
so the common user so just get whatever
you think yes yes thank you
Thank You Giovanni dragon 5:10 no no we
forgot we missed no that was no Thank
You Giovanni I'm sorry hello dragon five
ten ten dollars and one cent
sorry some love for Paul thanks for
answering my question on cows have been
upgrading my Linux box you had not
thought about handing my risin 1700 down
to the Linux machine later love you guys
yeah that was a great that was a great
suggestion
hey yep that's something that works out
for you I did good Matz with five bucks
I newb have my first high end system TR
for 1950 X finally built and been
looking at water-cooled tenday TTI
what's your thoughts on pre water-cooled
carts the ACE is Poseidon I know we're
what about EVGA hybrids or something
like that yeah I feel like it'd be an
option
they're fine there's a hybrid everyone's
that come with clothes love coolers
attached to them aren't trance are
typically transferable over to a custom
loop so they announce it or something
that you can integrate with the cooler
for your third Ripper as well make it a
little bit more sense but yeah beyond
that I'd say if you've already got the
1080i at 1080 anna warner block if
you're already looking at this type of
high-end system it would probably be the
best solution overall vers just getting
something that has one pre-installed
there like a hybrid like the Poseidon
yeah Do It Yourself
El Jefe review nine bucks put my five

contribution we appreciate so much so
much Thank You TV
Thank You TV and the best we love you do
you finally command
$10 love what you to do briefly what
each of you do to get into the tech
world what did you major in
did you need tech sort of those
certifications to work at newing was
everything you know pc wise today for
Newegg so I'll just be really quick I
graduate from college Newegg was the
first job I got out of college I knew
jack about pcs this guy taught me
most of everything I know fundamentally
of about pcs and I've since then built
upon that knowledge and
here we are today so yes that's that's
my quick story in a nutshell what did I
do to get into the tech world I I was
interested in computers even I read
magazines and that kind of thing back on
a day when or the internet was quite as
useful for porn research these days you
can just get all the info you need out
and down the internet yeah and then I
got a job at nuoc I didn't need any tech
certifications I had already worked at
Newegg for several years before I moved
into the role that I did where I was
making videos about tech stuff and that
kind of thing most of the stuff I know
PC wise I have been developing before I
worked at knowing but of course it
continued that um you know just trying
to learn as much as I could through
working there um hopefully that answers
your questions but Giovanni thank you
for your donation thank you sir Jakob
rails 20 bucks yo have some dollar e do
you also any idea when I'll be able to
actually buy in 8700 K they're
constantly sold out everywhere it seems
and until that comes and I'm stuck with
my ten atti being plugged into my old FX
8350 system holy crap yes you are
you could go rise and bro you could just
I mean risings readily available they
got plenty of stock go for a rise in
seven chip but if you're 780 700 K
specifically I don't know I don't have
the magic answer for you there as to
when Intel's gonna be in stock with that
they definitely run rush the coffee leg
launch to compete with Rison and because
of that they've also sort of it can get
a bit prematurely you can get one on
next to where your house right now for
$400 there you go how much it is next
where am I supposed to be I mean you may
have to wait a little bit longer and
chipping or even pay more and shipping
but you know anyway it's supposed to be
for 20 folk 20 blaze it 420 blaze it
is it if this is a I mean this is next
warehouse they have not the best reviews
no they have okay reviews sorry gonna go
to next warehouse right now you can buy
one for $400 yes you can add to Curt
looks like they shipped to anywhere in
the US and stuff sure there you go
check that out right Zachary Hummel five
bucks by the way I'm trying to give you
things and money call me Zach thanks
Zach thanks Zach you the best ZZR hardy
for the temas trillion Kyle will be a
natural for Barron's chatting the
Barrens check what is that Barron's
is an area and World of Warcraft
it's different now because when
Cataclysm happens they like split it up
and whatever but it was a very large
area and when you're playing World of
Warcraft's there's like a chat box and
you're in the bottom right guys and when
you're chatting you can chat into like
guild chat or you can if you're in a
party or snot grouping you do party chat
so every text you put in there might be
a different color whatever it sure so
there's a regional chat for whatever
area that you're in right the Barons was
a very very large area in Kalimdor
Western continent okay I think that's
right so it was just known for being an
area where whenever you went in there
there's lots of people randomly chatting
in Baron's chat okay so barons chat just
got sort of a reputation for being the
place where you go where it's suddenly
there'd be just randomness or just just
imagine going into a random chat room on
the internet with tons and tons of
people in it with whatever randomness
they want to talk about being distressed
that's okay yeah gotcha so he's saying
I'd be a social butterfly in this one
section of of the game exactly gotcha
perfect thank you is easier beautiful
beautifully said thank you very much sir
