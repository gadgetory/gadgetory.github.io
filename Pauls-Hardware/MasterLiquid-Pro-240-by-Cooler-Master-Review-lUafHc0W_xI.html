products from cooler masters master
series and so far I've liked what I've
seen there was the master case and the
master keys for example beyond that
there is also a master watt power supply
a master air air cooler and there's even
master gel thermal interface material
now which is you know nice I think that
the master branding works since it's
part of cooler masters name
feels vaguely associated with the PC
master-race and it implies that the
product represents the upper echelon of
what cooler master is able to produce
based on their years of experience
making PC hardware so today I take a
look at the master liquid pro 240 an
all-in-one cpu liquid cooler that's also
available an hundred and twenty
millimeter trim does this product
deserve a place among its master series
brethren or is it just masturbate so as
you might expect the master liquid pro
240 comes with a prefilled and sealed
240 millimeter radiator attached via fep
tubing to a unit containing a pump and
water block accessories include a rubber
gasket to put between the fans and the
rad mounting hardware and a backplate
for modern AMD and Intel sockets sets of
screws for mounting the thermal paste
and the rest of the plastic tabs and
standoffs for the mainstream or
enthusiast sockets he also gets a little
fan splitter for pin single to double
which is very convenient for using a
motherboard that doesn't have enough fan
headers also included are 220 millimeter
master fan pro air balance fans which
coolermaster says are balanced hence the
name for a mix between performance and
low noise operation rather than going
for an all-out high static pressure
design the not slouches though still
putting out two point three four
millimeters of h2o static pressure and
sixty six point seven cubic feet per
minute of air flow while generating a
maximum of 30 a weighted decibels of
noise at full speed the radiator has a
matte black finish and a tasteful
Coolermaster logo with the product name
in white on the side it's 27 millimeters
thick and although I was initially
disappointed that it used aluminum fins
rather than copper they do have a
special squared off design that allows
the fins to make more contact with the
channels while also providing more space
for airflow the concept of the design
makes sense to me so we'll see how it
plays out in testing the tubing is made
of fep that's fluorinated ethylene
propylene and material and I could
explain why
it's a good material for this purpose
but let's be honest you probably only
really care about how it looks
those ribbed ridges are there to keep
the tubing from kinking and I'll be
honest that this just is not my favorite
style of tubing when it comes to looks
it is thicker though so it's not quite
as bad as some of the thin fep tubing
that I've seen used in the past and I'm
sure there are some people out there who
actually prefer this over the sleeves or
rubberized tubing methods that I've seen
I'm just not one of them let's move on
to the pump and block unit note that
it's a separate pump and block connected
by a couple links rather than a pump /
block that's all together as one take
that a step patent lawsuits
now Coolermaster has some explanations
for why their design is better than the
competition here and while I'm inclined
to believe that's mostly to prevent
further litigation from ace tech who has
been rigorously enforcing their patents
over the past couple years in the USA at
least let's just see what's going on
beneath the housing first the master
liquid pump is further from the CPU and
heat generating components that makes
sense I suppose but it is hard to
evaluate how much that actually helps
next they're using the spraying method
on the CPU block itself pushing the
liquid down at the center of the micro
fins and allowing it to flow out on
either side this is definitely a better
method than the flow me across all the
fins from one side to the other method
and it is the same method employed with
high end CPU blocks from makers like ek
so apart from that the unit is taller
than others but probably not tall enough
to conflict with anything and also
there's a clear window with the cooler
master logo on it and a blue LED look
how nicely the blue LED matches with the
motherboard LEDs rejoice users who wants
blue to be part of their color scheme or
people with an RGB LED motherboard like
this one despair the rest of you who
don't want blue because as far as I can
tell there's no way to turn the damn
thing off I don't mind LEDs I don't even
mind static color LEDs as long as I can
disable them so anyway if you couldn't
already tell I have gone through the
installation process of putting the
master liquid pro 240 in the system
which wasn't too bad at all there's no
great improvements here on aftermarket
CPU cooler installation but no steps
backwards either and I ran some simple
tests to gauge performance to provide
comparison I also tested a first gen
corsair h 110 either to provide a
tougher challenge to the master liquid
pro 2 40 since the h 110 has a large
280 millimeter radiator or because it
was already installed in this system and
it was just super convenient
take your pick and I the case after the
proper burnin I checked temps at idle
after 15 minutes of no activity and
under load after 15 minutes of activity
running Ida 60 for system stability
tests I'm using in 5820k and I tested it
at stock speeds as well as overclocked
to 4.4 gigahertz I found that after
adjusting for ambient temperature these
two all-in-ones were just about
neck-and-neck with the H 110 running
half agree to a degree cooler than the
master liquid pro 240 this might not
seem like stellar performance for the
master liquid pro 240 but keep in mind
that it's significantly smaller at 240
millimeters versus 280 so I'm actually
pretty impressed that it kept up as for
noise I will share some footage of the
cooler running at idle and now running
at full load while overclocked
so please take these two recording
demonstrations with a grain of salt as
I'm just using the camera's mic
positioned about ten inches from the
cooler with a side panel off so it's not
the most scientific but you also get
bonus points if you can hear Hiro
snoring in the background just like
there was actually perfect timing
so now it's conclusion time for pros
with the master liquid pro 2 40 you get
solid build quality quiet if not an
audible noise generation and equivalent
performance to a last gen 280 millimeter
cooler which I actually think is pretty
good you also get a five-year warranty
from cooler master which is quite nice
as for cons I was mostly let down by the
master series labeling and the
expectations I had because of it if this
was my master liquid cooler it would go
all out and have a copper radiator
instead of aluminum maybe some RGB
lighting in the pump for at least some
means of turning it off which who knows
could be added in the future since I did
actually spot some extra connectors on
the pump connection points and maybe
some more premium feeling tubing or
potential expandability with industry
standard fittings like we saw with the
iceberg from Coolermaster a couple years
back ultimately I think this is a good
cooler and I was happy with the noise
and performance and at $120 its
competitive with a lot of the mid range
large all-in-one coolers on the market I
could see a better and more feature-rich
version of the master look with pro 240
though I just don't know what they call
it
maybe they add an X on the end that
usually works that is all for this
