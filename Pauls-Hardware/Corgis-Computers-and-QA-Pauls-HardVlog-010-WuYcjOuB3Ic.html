and I'm doing a quick vlog video the
reason for that is because I have some
not so fantastic news about the Arctic
Panther have you guys follow me on my
social medias met witters and my
instagrams you might have seen me
posting yesterday on Friday a fair
amount of work in progress on the side
panel mod however I came to a kind of a
wall at a stopping point and I really
just couldn't complete that video so
instead of sharing that video with you
guys right now instead here's a bunch of
corgis on the beach
alright guys I want to give you a little
bit more than just some corgis although
they're incredibly cute for today's
video so here at least is a look at the
side panel mod in progress and I'll give
you an explanation of kind of where I
got to as you might be able to tell I
don't know how well it's picking up the
hole is cut it's roughly the proper size
but there was just there were death
blemishes there's mistakes that were
made there's there's a pretty nasty one
for instance this was as I was doing
some of the filing down of the side
edges to get them straight and clean and
I I slipped that's really what it came
down to the protection wasn't there
anymore so it didn't turn out looking so
great there's a couple more along here
and then you can see this actual edge of
the mod itself which is smooth in some
places less smooth and others I was kind
of hoping to be able to go ahead without
any sort of covering on this I was
either gonna black pen it or maybe even
hopefully just have done a good enough
job on this that I I didn't have to
worry about anything like like the
edging and how it turned out but I can
run down you guys at least want my
issues where one was that I'm somewhat
unskilled with the jigsaw so far I've
used a jigsaw before but this is a brand
new one and I didn't practice at all i
just went straight for it which might
not have been the best decision as a
result i cut into the top edge a little
bit more so this goes up a little bit i
put another kind of i delved too deeply
on the on the bottom edge as well down
here so that's not quite as straight as
it should be two of the edges came out
pretty decent two of the edges were not
that coupled with the scuffs that i put
in it and in fact the one probably worse
cuff is down here yeah that one right
there and when you get something like
that and it won't buff out there's like
there's options you have but I don't
have very many of them so if you're
going to repaint and kind of need to
repaint the whole side panel I don't
have paint set up right now I don't know
what else to do other than maybe getting
a new side panel kind of starting over
and using some of what I've learned so
far to expand on that but um yeah that's
really what it's come down to
this the crappy thing is that it was
going really well up tell towards the
end when I made those kind of crucial
mistakes and then when I was looking at
my side panel my piece of glass right
here that my phone is on which costs
about 80 bucks and I and since I'm
gluing it this is going to be kind of a
one-shot deal I just came to the
conclusion that you know what I've not
ready yet I don't want to glue this
piece on yet and as a result I don't
have a video but that I would hadn't I
didn't want to do like a two-parter cuz
you know everyone's already sick of
those at least when they're not known
that's going to be a two-parter ahead of
time so I'm gonna try to work out what I
should do next on this I'd love to hear
your guys's feedback for what you think
I should do again the options are going
to be either get some channeling
material to go around the edges M&amp;amp;P seat
at Tech has some of that I think they
call it you channel so i might do some
of that another option would be to try
to salvage this piece here too i don't
know i don't know how i might salvage it
i might have to end up like doing a full
repaint job or the other option is just
to try to hit up fractal and see if i
can purchase another side panel by
itself and kind of start from scratch
and do a bit of a do-over but let me
know what you guys think I should do
because for now I'm kind of at a
stopping point apart from that though
it's really just the cables the cables
leaving job which I'm hoping she'd
arrived this week thus leaving stuff I'm
finally going to get rid of that mess of
multicolored cables up at the front and
that'll that'll do it so yeah but there
is our Arctic Panther thus far still
incomplete and to round out this video
I've decided to get incredibly pissed
off at all of my video production
equipment but hey that's how it goes
apparently there's some kind of
conspiracy to prevent me from publishing
a video this weekend but I'm not going
to let that stop me no I have reached
out to you guys on Twitter and asked for
random questions that I might be able to
answer here so let's see how this goes
Catman at playful 1510 asks what is your
favorite cheese got to go with debris
86a Francisco Felipe or Frank for life
asks go to brand for ssds i used to be i
would say like Samsung was it was a
really good recommend
in there 840 Evo Fiasco which kind of
was not didn't leave a lot of us in the
SSD review side very ecstatic about them
kind of set it back a little bit
although the 850 and 850 850 / 1 850 Evo
seem to be doing okay so far but
Samsung's a good one Intel is definitely
good they always have really high
reliability for their their drives are
not always the fastest Kingston's
another one that I like to use Corsair
has done some great jobs the neutron xt
was a fantastic drive sandisk is another
one send like sandisk and and samsung
for example they have like that vertical
integration going on they actual samsung
at least manufacturers every single part
of the SSD so that's always kind of nice
when you can go for that but yeah those
i'd say those are the ones that kind of
jump out at me and if i'm missing any
top ones i'm sorry about that what else
do we have Alan Alan 15000 three asks
what is it like doing youtube for a
living thank your content is great I
appreciate you putting so much work into
it by the way thank you alan so much
that means a lot to me especially right
now because i'm having a frustrating day
but it's ok it's great been doing
youtube for a living it's a lot more
work than you might expect it to be i
actually work a lot harder now than i do
when i was working for somebody else
because i'm working for me which is good
in some ways because it lets me get a
lot done it's bad in other ways too
sometimes i tend to work too long or
work into the evenings or work on the
weekends case in point saturday right
now and i'm supposed to be spending time
with my wife but that's ok ultimately
I'm really happy with the decision and I
just hope that YouTube keeps things
going in a good and positive way for its
creators to keep us able to do stuff
like this for those of us who have made
the dive into doing it full-time how
does it feel to have my glass of beer
spilled this is from Max rebson or at
max rebson I felt betrayed a little sad
little I was I was I was obviously
distraught over the loss of beer Kyle's
laptop and they can whatever but I'm
yeah those sad sad that that beer you
know was was wasted in such a way ian
savage or at snowblind board he asks why
I did not go to Coachella with forever
Kyle and Steve air with Kyle and Steve
um I didn't go because I like to be able
to like shower at the end of the day I
don't know I haven't been haven't been
like well I really haven't been any
major music festivals before Coachella
has some appeal for me but like I don't
know the camping thing that they're
doing I like camping but I don't like
camping with like the hordes and hordes
of hippies that you know like I don't
know there's just something less
appealing I like camping in the woods
like away from people not wear those
crowds unlike people having to find
places to use the bathroom and all that
kind of thing haiti cats or at haiti cat
kty citt asks why did we name it awesome
hardware when I could have that we could
have named it Paul sauce tried to go for
Paul sauce Kyle wouldn't go for it ajs a
underscore G rod asks how does it feel
to have a an Arctic Panther in the house
it feels great I wish I could I wish I'd
gotten more done at this this week then
I had done of Jenny Jenny Jenny asked a
question wait she asked a question and
now she's talking about something else
and I don't know Jenny Jennifer a
gearhead girl 27 asks what are three
absolutely necessary things to check or
set in your system when you're
benchmarking well the first thing you
want to check or set is to make sure
everything is up to date that includes
drivers for one thing but that also
includes all of your benchmarking
software I was like to make sure that
everything like cpu-z or gpu-z or
anything like that is up to date the
next thing is to make sure that you have
nothing nothing nothing running except
for the benchmarks you're running that's
if you want to do like a good benchmark
and give it the best possible chances I
like to unplug the internets to when i'm
running stuff although i don't always do
that now i used to do that more
frequently than i do now i guess and
then what else was that three things yet
i don't have those three things yet
that's roughly three things I hope that
helps Kyle Johnston or geek in dad asks
how am I liking the new 4k camera I'm
using it to court record right now i'll
be it in 1080 I'm liking it a lot
although I got really frustrated with it
just now because the stupid camera app
that I'm using to monitor myself on my
phone which just doesn't like to
remember the settings in the connection
its kind
annoying anyway I'll leave it at that I
did finally get it to work but just
getting pissed off at a prior to that
I'll do one more Michael Garza or at em
Garza 67 67 67 asks how often should I
upgrade my computer when is it time to
get a whole new computer that's a very
subjective question and it depends on
kind of what you're doing with it if all
you need is a computer for basic
internet access and that sort of thing
you probably don't need to upgrade it
ever again now I shouldn't say that but
you can use like you know cell phones
tablets that sort of thing for the
Internet if you're a gamer you probably
want to look at upgrading I'd say every
two ish years to upgrade at least your
graphics card and maybe the actual base
platform maybe three to four years for
your base platform like CPU memory
motherboard it's probably a bit better
solution or you know if you're hardcore
if you're an enthusiast than if you just
really into it then you know you can
upgrade every year if you want to do a
new system that's always fun okay though
that's up for my little little metal
impromptu Q&amp;amp;A session thanks to all you
guys on Twitter who asked me questions
I'm sorry to any of the guys who I
didn't get to but um this is already
gone longer than I was intending it to
but thanks for watching this video guys
I almost spilled my water I don't forget
to hit the like button and subscribe to
my channel and do all the fun things
down in the comments section hopefully I
will be back very soon this week not
only with updates on Arctic Panther but
