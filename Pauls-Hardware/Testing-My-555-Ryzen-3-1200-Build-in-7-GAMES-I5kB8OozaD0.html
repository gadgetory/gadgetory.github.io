hardware for today's video I thought I
would lighten up and play some freaking
video games but more to the point I will
be testing this system that I just built
to celebrate the launch of Rison 3 this
is my formerly $525 Rison 3 system build
but uh the video telling you how to
build it yourself
just posted a few days ago so I check
that link out if you want to check out
how to put the system together and I'm
going to be testing this in a variety of
games today and I'm going to be showing
you gameplay with actual performance on
screen now I quickly need to mention
that this is the now $555 version of
that builds because I actually don't
have a 2gig GTX 1052 use so this is the
4 gig GTI extensive DTI that's installed
in there other than that all the
components are pretty much the same and
I have been doing some setup on this the
set up if you guys aren't familiar with
the procedures to go through check out
my first 5 things to do after you build
a new PC video because I've pretty much
gone through almost all of that so far
and that I'm actually have this system
going over to this monitor right here
it's also passing through my capture
system right now so I'm going to be
capturing the stuff directly so it's
only going to be testing gameplay non
gameplay and streaming or anything like
that and I should be able to on the fly
show you guys what's going on my
shortcut keys I also have another camera
that's set up right up here actually so
that will get me while I'm actually
playing the games and then as you might
be able to see from on screen right now
I have actually done some quick
overclocking I did an update to the BIOS
for our motherboards our Asus prime v
350 M - a so our version 805 right now
with the newest of jeesus support from
AMD
we got the rise in 3 1200 installed and
I overclocked it to three point eight
five gigahertz it's actually running
about 3.8 4 gigahertz right now and
that's been pretty stable pretty cool
for me thus far so hopefully that
remains so while I'm actually gaming was
a very simple overclock to input so if
you guys are interested I will also put
a link to my how to overclock rise in 5
video which also applies just the same
to Rison 3 the memory is also set up
I've got 16 gigs install
and it's running at 29 33 or just about
29 33 at Casa latency 16 and then the
video card for now I'm just going to
leave running it at stock frequency
which is already overclocked out of the
box by MSI so that's my hardware setup
as for software I'm just going to be
running MSI Afterburner to show you guys
the on screen overlay of performance as
I'm gaming and that's about enough
introduction I think for now I need to
get steam installed excellent some games
copied over and I'm going to hit it and
start playing some video games it's been
a while since I played some video games
actually so the rest of the setup
actually took a little bit longer than
expecting is that it do some game
copying and everything but here's how
it's going to go down I'm going to set
my timer for 20 minutes we're starting
off with Grand Theft Auto 5 right now
I'm going to either go for 60 frames per
second or just as many frames per second
as possible if the game that habits
beginning more than that as for settings
are going to be playing all the games of
1920 by 1080 and then I'm going to be
using mostly high settings that I would
typically use when I would run
benchmarks but I'll run through them
just so you guys can take a look and
then I might be adjusting settings as I
go depending on how the game is
performing to get us a better frame rate
and everything so our aim rate and the
performance is displayed up there in the
top left there supposed to be a is a
spike you look like an elderly woman
okay little downhill action going here
I'll make for the route you can go wrong
good Hey
all right but I figure an Theft Auto I
used a controller when I'm driving
go to the meth lab that's a pretty
standard mission for gta5 pretty good
performance so far seven up 12 well
above 60fps seventies and eighties from
what I see when I glanced up at it
so goodnight mush
that's useful
I should do the issue to the air race
again that was fun green one this time
olds brung ya berate oh no oh wow
they put that crane there purposely that
goddamn crane - then again
oh come on ah that's over good for gta5
ok I gotta figure out what's next
that I decided the game too should be
rocket League so let's start by going
into our settings and FXAA high high
quality custom max up max frame rate got
texture and world detail at quality and
everything else is on all right
that is definitely useful since the 60
frames per second
these things about
in a fire
that's better okay all right here we go
here we go mine he's a joke that means
the ball in the correct direction and
happy buddy do that again
Center it come on team drive it home
there we go all right so I did around
there with the settings well I had vsync
on for a bit but I picked eventually
let's move the texture qualities up too
high since we're getting plenty of
frames at this point I mean obviously
that would be good for a high frame rate
situation she had like a hundred 2144 to
monitor you now to play this game the
ultimate servers on the Internet
yeah gonna play it safe in a stick back
here is the goalie goaltender oh shit
everybody I'm not very good in that
position
oh yay a still scoring somehow almost no
I have oh well that's no fun
connection timing out and stuff
unfortunately my connection cut out so I
didn't get to finish that last game but
we were definitely going to win that one
we were doing pretty good so I'm going
to call that one a win and let's move on
from rocket League we got a game number
three this is rise of the Tomb Raider
figured we'd traps and direct x12 and
also a game that's a bit more visually
you know stunning and and looks pretty
nice and everything also I haven't
played it nearly enough so when it comes
to our settings in the graphics we have
the high preset going on and like I said
we're in DirectX 12 I had and of course
thank you sway by 1080 still pretty
close to the beginning here it might be
noticing I'm definitely not getting a 60
frames per second and sitting down in
the rows in the 50s and sometimes even
the 40s so that catice tax is also
leading dysentery because I'd be sitting
cost
jeez
like half of the Caribbean something
like that I'm going to take a moment to
drop our settings down just a little bit
so that we can hopefully get ourselves
above 60 fps so let's just bump the
texture actually lets you go thick of
the presets just to keep it things
simple so we were high before so we're
just going to drop to medium and see how
that works then she could like it I've
don't plan a few maybe if I keep scaring
McCullough that was too close
the Dawson away oh no all right I gotta
get up there
okay there we go
good slack get open the floodgates so it
looks like drop in the settings to
medium has given us a few more frames
all the way are still within below sixty
from time to time
again forgot to push villainous but
they're referring for about six minutes
oh I was not paying attention there and
I died it's not that easy that aha
that's what I miss yeah I mashed the
super good thing Oh chips and fasting
yes sir or ma'am or whoever wrote the
text a national title day
oh look at the same part from the
benchmark and I'm going to jump back
into the graphics and give us a shot at
low settings just to see how things look
as well as what kind of additional
frames we might be able to get oh wow
this is totally Eddie blue the last
second on that one okay I survived
we shot as an archaeologist so life is
so glamorous with dangerous mystery okay
yeah we got a Bugatti
oh never mind walls are collapsing too
large large boobs are up okay as the
dramatic escape fnatic it would look a
little bit better for setting trips to
on medium-high and my time has just run
out the wrath of the Tomb Raider
obviously a more challenging game to run
and you're not going to have quite as
easy a time getting over 60 FPS even at
1080 but as you can see if you have
options and I imagine by fiddling with
some of those in-between settings rather
than just going from high to medium low
you might be able to get a nice balance
between framerate and textures moving on
to overwatch a game that I have played
but not recently so we now have doom
fists available let's check out our
graphics options first off we want to of
course not the mitts fps or movies maxed
out at 300 and then for graphics quality
we'll leave it at high although we do
want to make sure that render scaling
for now is just at 100% so it's actually
rendering at 1920 by 1080 they might
play that later on if I want to try to
get some higher frame rates but see how
this goes
well I died but I died at least
attacking the target and I even pay
attention in my frames per second I'm
getting over 100 that's pretty good
memory usage is 125 gigabytes MF CPUs
we're not doing too bad gram low low 60s
as far as temperatures go
I added CPU temperature for this time
around by the way
hey big 30 so I'm pretty happy with my
framerate I mean like I can get I'm
getting up over a hundred that's just
natural how do I tell I settings
everything's really smooth the hot over
man new beads inside so yeah I mean over
watches them to the most difficult games
friend that I think you all thanks we're
not even having to use display scaling
or anything like that keep it go okay
move the graphics quality to medium so
we're just can see for you high frame
rate lovers out there if this if this
gets us like maybe over 144 FPS playing
on a high frame rate monitor should give
Jim tests to try I've seen the barest
minimum of information about what he's
able to do this is the one I can charge
up and then a charge forward and it's
also supposed need ask
all right we are like right up there
right at us all right we're getting up
above 140 FPS so that's nice I mean
let's get back out in the open so it's
actually doing something oh I just I I
bet people do that all the time just
like the newest moves you can make your
specific there I go damn it did not kill
that healing because that's time setting
this up anyway decide to do one more
game of overwatch and I've now switched
the settings to ultra and the options
here so red ultra and we are not doing
render scaling at all so just to see
this turns out if you're more interested
in quality than framerate so you can
still get well about 6 weeks since we
were easily hitting well above a hundred
and when we were on high settings
together we asked the wrong so looking
pretty good although we're not outside
good so since my last game did ends with
the system restarting one once again
most likely due to the overclock I did
add a little bit more voltage just a
little bit more
I killed a medic
I keep their healer I hate their healer
I want to choose the type God alright
we've now seen it let's overwatch tin do
or what the system can do with overwatch
at those high low and ultra settings
let's move on switching things over to
doom now because I wanted to try to
Vulcan title so as you can probably see
on the screen I switched to Vulcan mode
and as for our settings we are stalled
1920 by 1080 turn vsync off we use an FX
AAA and this stuff is all me no motion
blurs on low right there and as for
advanced where I'm Vulcan and we have
the ultra setting it going on so I'm
going to play this is a game I'm a part
way into not too far and I sure hope I
remember what the heck is even going on
but already things were looking not too
bad we're hitting well over 70 FPS
although wait what just happened we just
dipped
oh it's things to kill I am a bad aim
alright do then jeez run away okay
that's trying to make a point right
there because the point out shine make
is a B Ram is well over 2 gigabytes as
far as let's me news right now so this
is not something you could accomplish
with the 110 dollar gtx 1050 you would
need a four gig sin 50 TI at least at
the d7 okay
oh yeah he button there we go
let me get your oh no I hate those guys
hey this case none anyway and terrible
there will a mning it things that move
Mouse settings are a little twitchy
right now to which is it helping I
didn't get the kid over you do the
finishing move on them
everybody needs to change my mess Teddy
yeah so let's just switch over from
ultra too high so you can get a few more
frames we have been that dipping below
60 frames per second from time to time
so maybe dropping back to high office as
like that also are you I don't think
I've seen you before
keep like working around or something
ah
hahaha
ooh gun upgrade super check ahead how'd
it go
oh no I didn't matter to you whoa I ran
out of ammo for my super shotgun okay
thank you for dying big dude I think my
little experiment works as far as
changing the settings from ultra down to
high def higher frame rates and keeping
well above 60 FPS so with vsync on which
I would usually play out if I wasn't
testing max frame rates that'd be pretty
good situation all right let's on the
bump next up we got game number six this
is Sniper Elite for DirectX 12 or at
least I'm playing it in DirectX 12 mode
X 20 Benton he of course beer and it's
already up over two gigs and yeah I just
got this recently for benchmarking so I
came 60 bucks worth so I thought why
don't I go ahead and play some of it
I'll just do a new campaign and I'm
gonna go normal cuz I'm Alice and I'm
not going to bother with most of this
stuff in school play as far as game
options go uh tanky of course under
scales 100 and then we're graphics
details are set to high Advanced Options
these think is off and async compute is
on again we're in direct now you can
ocean to those men with a lovely setting
here so we're already starting out a
little bit below 60 FPS soo and then I
get to shoot that holding my brothers
giving my shot
boom at frame rate is not so hot I mean
it's not terrible terrible but it is
like just below 60 so I am going to just
bump our settings to medium and we'll
see how that goes
I cover his load and again the car just
shooting me I'm doing this wrong hey my
problem is that I'm playing that's like
Grand Theft Auto and that's not how I
should explain this game so yeah that's
about all the time I guess I have for
sniper late for I had some difficulty
getting the hang of this game it's a
stealth game I'm not so great at stealth
games but I'm staying about 60 frames
per second and and I think that's just
fine for this situation and again I've
been playing at medium settings so start
high now medium would definitely keep
you above 60 FPS but I think I got one
more game left in me to try out for this
round so let's move on alright guys the
last game I'm going to be trying here is
player unknowns battlegrounds and this
is an insanely popular game right now
even though it's not fully completed but
you can't pick it up so I did and I'm
going to be playing with these settings
1920 by 1080 and then most everything at
high shadows aren't medium and I did
turn the foliage too low this is my
first ever time of playing player
unknown battleground sometime going to
be Nibin enough not too different from
most of the games of
playing today but I did at least watch
like one video tutorial kind of on the
basics of it so I think I think with
that in mind let's get started
you'll be able to train these houses
over here there's another person I say I
know there's another person in a way and
I plan on top of these boxes Wow okay a
baseball hat which does nothing for me I
know there was another person who landed
right over here but I've no idea when
they're also I think there's going to be
like a blue circle of death that starts
closing soon too
okay I got a smoke bomb if anyone comes
at me except I just need to do that I
just wasted my only smoke bomb mix now
I've gotta spend green how do you punch
I can punch okay yep hey I made rank
number 69 though I mean if that's not an
accomplishment my first time playing
player known battlegrounds I think okay
over here in graphics I'm going to
switch an alias and the hi I'm just go
switched mostly to medium just go
everything medium except foliage wages
on low if you difference okay that's
those are my settings cool good just
chill in the bathroom how long do they
hang on the bathroom and just survive
it's a great game is your like paranoid
all the time ooh first aid kit shotgun
death and chills and good and this
bathroom is which backed up I feel like
I should do something I should move but
I feel so safe in my little house where
I have a shotgun now and stuff also my
framerate is not exactly where I want it
to be we're still in the 50s alright I
think I'm going to bump down to too low
and except I'll keep the view distance
of medium oh that feels a lot smoothie
and I feel in that view distance was
certainly something that was causing
something I don't know it was cause I'm
overloading because I'm outside I'm
worried I need to go this direction so
I'm just going to go that direction look
around I'm just lying in a bush right
now how much how much is player unknown
battlegrounds is just lying in a bush if
so it's the most exciting bush flying
game that I've ever played I'm one a
half-ish and I got to try to make it one
of these buildings if you like need the
safety of a building if anyone comes in
here they're getting a shotgun blast to
the face just happy I got a car hey look
it's another car house that doesn't
belong to anyone I wouldn't know one
who's lining me up in their sights right
now gonna hang out over here on the
beach I think if those appear clear that
this town is going to be like the final
spot for people I get that right here by
this rock and that's figure that I'm
safe knowing comes from swimming out of
the ocean Brock will protect me I can
see the wall losing in roundest oh it's
going to be like right on my ass and a
couple seconds but it's not going to end
up on the town it's going to end up like
out here in the middle of nowhere
blue circle close it in I think it's
going to separate me from my vehicle
which probably isn't the best I got one
minute
there's somebody
I hope they kill each other
that good I'm cut I'm stuck in a
difficult position I know God in a way
to me ah as a third person left now as a
fourth prison as number for my second
type like I did it mainly through
Carrodus and since I was always survived
but hey that's probably the best I will
ever do at siren owns battleground so I
mean I guess I can't complain too much
dang so player unknowns battlegrounds
there's definitely a lot of fun I will
definitely need to come back to this and
play it some more as you can see once I
drop down to low settings so was able to
get a very decent frame rate in the 80s
and 90s for the most part you're
probably that play with a combination of
like medium and low settings - it gets a
little bit better looking experience
without getting yourself below 60fps
overall though keep an eye on you know
all of these stats that were up here
across the games because obviously that
will give you guys an idea of what the
game is actually doing behind the scenes
as it's being played for a lot of the
games that I played in today's test most
of the time the RAM that was used never
went above maybe 3 to 6 gigabytes so
that's cool knowing you can pretty much
get by with 8 gigabytes of system Ram
CPU temperature was also a very
reasonable I would say consider I'm
using a stock cooler the RAM usage also
something to keep an eye on especially
if you're looking at a budget graphics
card because there are definitely ton of
games that go above that 2 gigabyte
limit at this point and that is where
you will start to see a big performance
drop-off when you're talking about the
super budget cards like the GTX 1050 2
gig but really quick let's exit and here
we can see some of this
I've been recording as I've been playing
so for instance the max GPU core clock
was a 1797 although it was actually
running more like around the 1650 to
1670 range fan speed was reasonable this
is definitely not quite a system I've
been playing it with with it sitting
here right next to me even with these
headphones on which I realized I don't
need to have end on anymore
I they are open headphones but I could
definitely hear the system through them
oops
GPU then apart from the little buzzing
noise at the GPU sanest are to make
which is kind of annoying also see if I
can fix that the system's not terribly
quiet so you know that's just something
that you could only get by upgrading the
CPU cooler possibly to GPU fan system
fans maybe as well as far as the CPU
temperature the max that it got up to
was sixty seven point eight degrees and
that is again with that overclock it is
running at I have it set to three point
eight to five gigahertz but actually
running at three point eight one five
but the voltage is quite reasonable max
voltage was one point two eight seven
and most of the time it's run at about
one point two five to one point two six
so guys I hope you've enjoyed this video
and I hope this style of benchmarking so
you guys can just see some of the
gameplay and see some of the performance
as it happens is useful to you I hope
it's also been a nice balance between
watching the gameplay getting through
from game to game and showing you guys a
nice sampling from each one as well as
trying a few different settings with
each game to give you a better idea of
what you might expect when it comes to
framerate and getting a framerate that's
either above 60fps if you have a 1080 60
monitor or if you have a high refresh
rate monitor getting something that's
more like 120 144 or even a little bit
beyond that but guys if you enjoyed this
video of course its thumbs up button and
let me know and of course put your
comments in the comments section let me
know what you think again of this style
of benchmarking video because this is
something that I wouldn't mind doing
like every couple weeks and trying a
different system build or a different
GPU and
CPU configuration thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
