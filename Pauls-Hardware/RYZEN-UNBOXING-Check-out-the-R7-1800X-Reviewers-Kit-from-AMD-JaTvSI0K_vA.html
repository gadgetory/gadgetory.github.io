Paul's hardware today I am bringing you
an unboxing video of the Andy risin 7
1800 X processor this is actually the
entire media reviewers kit that they
were giving out to media so people like
myself who were at their recent events
that they held in San Francisco they've
also been shipping it to a bunch of
independent reviewers as well for people
who weren't able to make it to that
event or who weren't invited I don't
know why some people were invited you
can speculate on that invent comment
section down below but I don't do
unboxing videos very often because I
find that they don't really usually add
a whole lot to the experience but I find
but this one was special first off it's
my first unboxing of an actual rising
processor it seems like a pretty
impactful pretty important watch going
on right now everyone's talking about it
whether you're an Intel or an AMD fan it
should help you out either way also just
a double check I asked people over on
Twitter if they'd be interested in an
unboxing since we can't exactly show you
the benchmarks yet those are still under
embargo and the response was pretty much
yes yes yes absolutely everyone everyone
seems to want it to some degree or
another so thanks to my guys who replied
so quickly and diligently to my tweets
and all that said here goes I'm going to
I'm going to start unboxing this thing
now just to be clear this was available
to me when I was up in San Francisco and
actually actually told AMD that I was
gonna hand carry it and then I forgot
this Kyle and I we're all had also
decided to do the live show up there
this is the challenge and so I brought a
bunch of live show streaming stuff and
that end assessed meaning that I didn't
have enough time to bring this back so
thankfully Andy being the good people if
they are said don't worry we will ship
it to you and it arrived just just
yesterday and maybe if you're surprised
that I haven't opened it yet well
I was mowing Milan again yesterday I
didn't make a video Lima llama Spencer
so heard from lots of mole-rat and here
we've got we've got a knock to accord
the NH Youth will ask this one is
actually special and II am for press kit
Edition see what makes that special then
we've got the actual thing okay now that
all right so the box that they made is
three nights actually is this is walnut
it is for my understanding they train a
small hole like nanobots using rise in
technology I believe that the sensitive
sense that I think to do with artificial
intelligence to burrow in here and
specifically crevice AMD rises logo
which is in there because pretty nice
this is real this is real walnut too by
the way
they may tell us with this one not like
it's not like vertical bar anything like
that handles on top and then of course
we got a latch and hinge so this vnh
shoots will se special-edition then the
tower style cooler from not to us so
Ryan nothing you guys haven't seen
before all nickel-plated so kind of a
nice silver finish all blacks not to a
fan hey I think that's actually makes
this special we keep running over this
gonna be up yeah so this is a and for
press kit version which it says right
there
press Q Titian which has an NSF 12
industrial PPP mm so the industrial
version of the an effete as well which
is all black
that's pretty nice section so that also
of course comes with the and formatting
 right there and that should allow
us to on a name for motherboard elite so
let's get the thermal paste I like a
stuff in there too alright you can see
probably can see people before so let's
move on so here is the box itself the
main event open the latch I'm expecting
there to be a some sort of light that
appears or something like that
angel this would be 1800 X and this is
the one that most reviewers could be
getting at least someone's who I talked
to there are seventeen hundred and
seventeen X is going out as well but I
am NOT going to be checking out the 1700
until launch day itself when I'm going
to go pick up the one that i pre-ordered
so yep side window as you might have
seen for for the CPU boxes and this one
doesn't seem like it comes with the
cooler
I don't feel cooler than that but I mean
thankfully a simple okay just a little
insert there are you ready for resident
yes yes I am should be now and just in
case you're wondering this box was
handcrafted by woodchucks USA through
there by one plant one program so
probably sustainable walnuts I guess
would be my assumption there they also
included some memory because jargon ddr4
memory to go along with your ice and
they have included a Corsair Vengeance
lpx kit 16 gigs two by eight gigs 3,000
megahertz is the speed on that and I
really like this Ram because it's just
it gets the job done it's black it's
black PCBs it's low-profile it works
it's functional and this is Corsair it
sends to get validating with a lot of
the third-party partners that are out
there very quickly by waiting of course
we have a motherboard and I happen to
have gotten the Oryx
a 370 ex-gay me five I'm sorry
a X 370 gaming five right here
so this motherboard and for of course
x-37b chipset if you want to over soccer
eyes and you need an x3
chipset or be 350 chipset the outline I
have still not memorized all the
different rises I am for chip steps
idiotic is love different ones of them
confusing so just getting on the names
of the three TVs the tape referring to
that in my head but there is that
motherboard we look at that mounting
solution
nothing solutions like already on a day
that was pre message from the kit or
what there's excess that's just how the
motherboard comes in other word does
have a backplate here's a look at the
socket itself lock it actually to me is
more reminiscent of like FM 2 which has
got that gap in the middle but of course
the pin layout is very different and
everything labeled socket name for still
a PGA or pin grid array socket so you
still have pins on the CPU itself and
then Boris no gigabytes with since this
is a porous board because you made it
fancy with stuff like steel reinforced
slots we have LEDs going on in there the
LED strip going down the side these are
all RGB and then I believe there yes
there is an RGB W header on the
motherboard as well station connects up
your RGB light and get all your energy
because that's going on to the Lord
knows it's not enough that available on
the market edit let's actually get to it
and open the processor itself this feel
so momentous feels so so important right
now so on it is the first first then CPU
that I have in box also nice I will
point out so just just to draw this up
even further
that got retail boxes going for this I
just received early samples and
engineering samples of products from
tech companies in a wide variety of
formats they can come from anything like
this which is completely labeled logo
printed retail box sample is sealed as a
serial number two
literally like a cardboard box with like
some random foam pieces in there and
then like just the part like a graphics
card or something and just an
anti-static bag with nothing else
nothing else beyond that it looks like
you know it's full through the gray
market or something like that but this
one is fully legit now again I'm not
sure at this point although it should be
confirmed I'm sure very soon if this is
going to with a cool or not is there
it's labeled here no heat sink fan
included it's also labeled not for
resale DOS but these might be slightly
different than the retail pencils that
you guys are getting at the actual well
whatever retailer that you have to go
with just to see see you in there a
little but a little little movie to get
a sticker there stickers I'm gonna say
sticker maker Stingo gun F database it
just an old collection of stickers
processor though and its own little
printed case by itself
there's the clamshell and here is 1800 X
it's not quite in Christian condition I
will point out I don't know if you guys
can tell this does look like it's been
perhaps used a little bit but I imagine
these early samples they probably did at
least a little bit of testing with
perhaps maybe I don't know maybe they've
been that maybe they gave me the special
one that's the overclocking that isn't
all the other one up there that's always
a possibility
and suddenly they oh yeah I guess I
guess that's really all there is to show
um I do want to point out that Andy's
also done edging as the rise and logo on
the top of CPU stuff which I also think
is a nice touch you can see not just the
skew of whatever see to you that where
they're thinking had 1,800 X 1,700 1,700
that's what came through so far
you also got the handy right and logo on
there now you're not going to see it
except when you install the processor
but there's no comment it's like a it's
like a step up you know the step stuff
in the right direction good brandy
because I am now going to install it and
then I'm going to start benchmarking
that's not out of it and I will be
bringing you guys that information as
soon as I am able to share it with you
I'm going to be comparing this to the
system back there which is 68 50 K in it
which is the closest in price to this
processor Intel CPU I guess other than
the 6800 k but I don't have a strict a
target 1550 K and also compared to the
7700 K just so we can get a bit more
instructions per clock comparison
between the Zen architecture and the K
bulik architecture the Intel is
currently running on the main screen
guys oh thank you so much for watching
this video I hope you have enjoyed it
more rides and stuff coming at you very
soon it sums up about money way out I
think so you guys again who responded to
my tweet and I will see you next how do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
