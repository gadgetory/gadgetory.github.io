hardware if you were looking for
gratuitous close-ups of the fastest
video card currently available well
you've come to the right place today I'm
gonna be taking a closer look at the AMD
Radeon HD 7990 and now for a closer look
at the card the first thing you probably
notice is three sizable fans providing
cooling for this graphics card around
them you have a black and red plastic
shroud then beneath the shroud and the
three fans you have two massive aluminum
finned heat sinks each of the heat sinks
has four copper heat pipes that are
extend from the respective GPU up
through the fins and the heatsink to
help provide some more heat dissipation
and then you actually also have some
copper fins up there at the top and
those are providing some extra cooling
for the power delivery as far as video
outs you have four mini display ports
and a single dual link DVI you can push
up to five monitors from this single
card there's also a bit of ventilation
there at the back but primarily the fans
are gonna actually pushing heat across
the fins and then it's gonna be moving
out through the open shroud so if you do
plan to install this in an enclosed case
make sure you have plenty of airflow
because you're going to need to help
evacuate some of that warmer air you
have a PCI Express gen3
standard style connector down there at
the bottom of course I got a crossfire X
finger at the back and you can of course
set two of these up for a quad crossfire
X configuration and then you also have a
very nice backplate that is on the back
as well so that helps provide a little
bit more protection for the PCB and give
it a bit of a cleaner look overall I
also have a black brace that you can't
really see from these images but that's
down between the the heatsink and the
PCB that provides some extra rigidity to
keep it straight when it's installed as
far as specs we have well 2 Radeon HD
7970 gigahertz Edition GPUs integrated
under this card it's really quite a feat
of engineering that AMD has pulled off
here both of these are going to maintain
a 375 watt TDP you also have 2048 stream
scissors in each of your Radeon HD 7970
gigahertz edition GPU 128 texture units
x 232 wraps x 2 and then as far as the
clock speeds you're actually only 50
megahertz below the full clock speed of
the 7970 GE so 950 megahertz core clock
and then you also get power toon boost
that AMD has been introducing with the
gigahertz edition so you can get a boost
clock of up to 1,000 megahertz and
that's compared to the standard at 7970
which is 1010 54 core clock and boost
clock you do get 6 gigabytes of gddr5
memory that's gonna be running at 6
gigahertz as well so really really fast
memory also included also with a very
nice big interface to buy a 384 bit for
each set of memory so you're essentially
gonna have 3 gigabytes of memory for
each GPU and that's gonna wrap it up for
this video guys on a closing note I was
checking as of the filming of this video
if any of these video cards are actually
currently available for sale and
unfortunately the answer is well yes
they are but no none are in stock I
found a Dan board vendor partners who
have created versions of this including
gigabyte power color sapphire as well as
XFX unfortunately every single one
currently sold out I guess we'll have to
blame the Bitcoin miners for that but
anyway if you are interested in this
video card keep your eyes peeled to
newegg.com use the auto notify function
that's probably going to be your best
bet to actually find one but apart from
that I guess you have to settle for
gratuitous close-ups and videos like
this one but if you did enjoy this video
don't forget to hit that like button
also don't forget to subscribe so you
can see more of my videos as soon as I
publish them again thanks for watching
and we'll see you in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
