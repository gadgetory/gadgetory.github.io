hardware I have a very exciting video
for you guys I'm going to try to make
this quick because I'm in San Francisco
right now I was invited by AMD for a
rise in tech day they have announced new
information it's confirmed we have at
least three skews we have pricing we
have a launch date so I'm just going to
get right into the hard data and I'm
going to be reading off some notes here
so starting March second you're going to
be able to buy up to three risin risin
7-series CPUs you can get all three if
you want or you can just buy one of them
you get you can actually start pre
ordering these CPUs on februari 20
seconds and at launch you can actually
buy a full rise in system they're going
to have 185 different retailers and
boutique OEMs a lot of systems available
from the top there is the 1800 x the
risin 7 1800 x it's going to cops 499
dollars that's less than a lot of people
anticipated all these CPUs in the risin
7 series are eight core 16 thread
processors the 1800 x has a 3.6
gigahertz base clock a 4 gigahertz boost
clock they didn't confirm the TDP
although we've heard rumors that it
should be 95 watts which is confirmed to
be the tvt of the next step down which
is the 1700 x back to the 1800 x though
in cinebench it's about nine percent
faster than a 6900 k and the
multi-threaded testing AMD did and a
single sided test it's about equal
instructions per clock performance to
the 6900 k and only 500 bucks which is
significantly less than a 6900 k costs
right now for four hundred dollars or
399 you can get a 1700 x that one is a
3.4 gigahertz base clock 3.8 gigahertz
boost clock 95 watt TDP and again we're
assuming that also applies to the 1800 x
although that wasn't confirmed for sure
the 1700 xn am these tests beats the
eight core 6900 k and the six core 6800
k by about four percent and thirty-nine
percent respectively in Cinebench r15
it's in a multi-threaded test of course
so we are getting some benefits in the
cinebench tests from the fact that
Righton does have eight cores and 16
threads whereas some of these cpus from
intel they're comparing them to our only
six core or four core but if that's all
intel has and if they're charging as
much as i charge in for their eight core
and ten core parts then this is a nice
kick in the pants for them the final
chip that
is confirmed today is the one I think is
going to be most interesting to you guys
325 dollars you can get yourself an r 7
1700 so three gigahertz base clock 3.7
gigahertz boost clock 65 watt TDP so it
shouldn't even be as hot as the 1700 x
in the 1800 x 20 megabyte l2 and l3
cache and again in AMD's test they
showed it beating a fork or 7700 k by
about forty six percent in Cinebench r15
and of course the 7700 k costs a little
bit more than 325 dollars right now
depending of course where you buy it now
those are the three processors those are
the ones we know and those are the ones
are going to be up for sale either
pre-order februari 20 seconds or up for
sale retailers on march second so that's
pretty exciting we now know what the
processors cost we now know where when
we're going to be able to buy them we
have not had a chance of course to do
independent testing of any of these but
AMD did have some demos to run so let me
at least share some of those with you
really quick instead a benchmark 15 they
have been testing this of course for
well since verizon was first sort of
announced in public size the 1800 x NHS
was 99 percent faster in multi-threaded
and equal performance in single-threaded
testing to the 6900 k that's pretty nice
they also did a gaming test with sniper
elite to this was in directx 12 mo
drying at 4k they're running with dual
RX for 80s and they had a 6900 caver
system art 7 1800 x the 1800 x was about
5 to 10 frames per second faster hitting
about 75 to 80 frames per second in that
test which was pretty nice and then they
also did a hand brake tests for video
encoding that was at the risin seven
1700 versus the 7700 k and the risin
system in that test was ten seconds
faster than the 7700 k and i've already
mentioned it costs list in the 7700 kate
so that's pretty nice another are some
other random specs and stuff that they
let you guys might find interesting so
the rise and I for example is built from
4.8 billion transistors it also has
2,000 meters of signal wire in there
which is pretty insane to think about
for such a small old cpu am DS goal when
they were developing rising was forty
percent instructions per clock
improvement over their previous
generation which is the excavator
excavator core and incentive bench tests
as well as overall but of course
depends on what types of tests you're
running they actually achieved
52-percent IPC improvement over the last
generation that's pretty damn impressive
actually the entire crowd burst into a
little bit of applause when they did
that now at launch because you're going
to need a motherboard to go along with
your processor there you're saying that
they're going to have 82 different and
for motherboards available from a
variety of all of the motherboard
vendors that you've come to know and
love that had someone display downstairs
there was an a there were ATX and
micro-atx versions i did also ask them
about mini-itx motherboards they are
expecting them to come out probably not
right at launch but they will be coming
out in the future not much further
confirmation besides that but yes
mini-itx will be coming for rising soon
they have 19 system builders like
boutique system builders that are gonna
have rising pcs at lunch and they have
going to have up to 200 by the end of q1
so they're going to be working with all
of the system board partners that you
may have heard of in the past and then
again marks March second to the launch
day for this it will be sale for sale
worldwide they're saying it will have
strong availability which I take to mean
that yes there will be lots of them but
given the pricing here you might still
expect them to sell out so we usually
don't recommend pre-orders but you never
know I mean if you really want to rise
and you might want to pay attention to
that februari 20 seconds pre-order dates
when pre-orders will go up for sale
that's pretty much all i have to say
about rising but i wanted to leave you
guys with one last thing that's a look
at an actual vega GPU yeah this is the
same one that they had on display at CES
but they weren't letting anyone take a
very close up look at it unless you were
special like Linus and you can get
special treatment but anyway even then
they had it like taped over with gaff
tape and stuff they don't have it taped
over now so you can actually see the
power delivery on it is a 6-pin and an
8-pin that's pretty much all there is to
see again this is an engineering sample
board that's what it's got like a USB
3.0 or on it and stuff like that but
that wraps it up for this video guys
again I really hope you enjoyed it all
that information is really exciting news
I'm really excited for aizen i think the
pricing is right in line with what we
were hoping it would be because it's
really going to challenge intel a lot of
fronts and it's going to bring like an
eight core cpu eight core 16 thread cpu
down to a little bit a little bit more
reasonable price for people who are
looking to build higher end systems for
gaming or content creation or
what-have-you of course we don't have
any independent
test yet all of those are going to be
coming out in the future so keep an eye
of course on my channel as well s
Weather Channel's I'll put some links to
see people who are here down in the
description too and thanks for watching
guys systems up something on your way
out we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
