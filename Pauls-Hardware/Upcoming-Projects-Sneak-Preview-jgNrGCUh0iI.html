a problem maybe it's a blessing who
knows but I once again have far too many
boxes that have arrived therefore I must
take the things out of them I'm going to
make a video of that that's what you're
watching stay tuned the hydrotech series
is Corsairs new line of custom cooling
parts built for the world's most
powerful and stunning systems they've
gone all out with CPU and graphics card
water blocks pump reservoir combos
fittings tubing radiators and coolant
providing you with everything you need
to build a spectacular custom cooling
loop that lowers system temperatures and
improves performance complete with vivid
RGB light click the sponsor link in the
video description to learn more decided
to start from the smallest box and we'll
move up to the biggest box and there's a
couple things today that I might not
actually be able to show you guys so
apologize if I leave you teased but I
have some emails out to see if I can or
cannot show you some things point being
if I can't you'll you'll find out about
that stuff soon enough this box was
actually sent to my PO Box which any of
you guys can send me stuff at as few
bucks for three to five Diamond Bar
California area code nine one seven six
five and just send it to Paul's hardware
this was just an order from Amazon and
it looks like we have a Spider Man
pocket pop keychain see if we have any
message in here hey Paul this is de
Benjen a big fan from India hope you
enjoy it well thank you very much Adam
and I will enjoy this and usually I
unbox this type of thing on the live
show so I think I'll bring it over there
for our next live show which is gonna be
here to give you some proper credit
there as well this is awesome here's a
better look it's a glorious little
keychain wow this is a very large head
looking that's got an articulating body
that's kind of fun alright awesome thank
you very much again de Benjen and let us
move on these next two boxes I kind of
already know what's in them so I'm going
to unbox them together because they're
very similar things that are in them
this one's from new egg though it's not
obvious and this is actually something
that I ordered on launch day it's not
already obvious these are AMD processors
yes look they have a slimmed down
version of the box for the $36 so in
Rison 3000 launched they sent out some
review samples to reviewers and they
sent out the 3,700 X and the 3900 X
which are the mid to higher end I guess
from the product stack there
but I of course wanted to check out the
more entry level options because we have
a $200 rise in 536 hundred here and then
a $250 rise in five 3600 X so I'm going
to be able to give you guys a quick
comparison here as to what the
difference is between these two I think
they both come with coolers
yes that's confirmed socket and for heat
sink fan included but it is the rape
stealth that comes with 3600 so here's
our box here's our cooler yes that is a
rape stealth that is confirmed so with
this little 65 watt TDP 6 core processor
you get a relatively small cooler this
will get the job done but you can
definitely get better performance
especially if you're just looking for
something that'll keep things a little
bit cooler but maybe give you a little
bit better performance out of the XF are
two of extended frequency range so you
can get a little bit more out of your
risin 5 3,600 that said for 200 bucks
this is sort of get getting you in on
the ground floor for the rise in 3000
series and you could of course use this
process cooler and it would get you by
just fine
but you know you might want to upgrade
it in the future same time for the 3600
X 50 bucks more you're gonna get a
processor with various very very similar
performance especially if you're willing
to overclock it a little bit but you do
get for your money a bit better of a
cooler is it 50 bucks more worth of a
cooler that's debatable and I guess I
should also point out it's not the RGB
version of the race spire because that
that does exist it does come up
reapplied thermal paste up now after I
ordered those I got a message from AMD
and they're like hey we're gonna send
out some more processors and I was like
oh cool and then they sense whatever is
in this box
I think Rison 3000 series processors I
might be receiving should be ah 1 &amp;amp; 2 so
here I have 2 more rice and 3000 series
processors actually the risin 530 600 X
which means I have two of those now I
think I might upgrade the HTPC with one
of these and then I also have the AMD
risin 530 400 G which is an APU unique
thing about the 3400 G and I only just
realized this is this actually is a Zen
plus 12 nanometer architecture so it
doesn't support PCI Express Gen 4 but it
does have much better performance than
the original 2000 series of AP use like
the 22
20400 geez so if you comparing the two
unless you're getting an insane deal on
the 2000 series ap use then you should
probably update to the 3000 series ap
use and they do have Radeon graphics
integrated I'm gonna leave these sealed
in their retail boxes for now because I
just took those out and honestly there's
nothing different
and these compared to those the same
cooler I believe the rates spire for
both of these is what ships with it so
stay tuned for more rising 3000 series
builds coming at you real soon as
mentioned at the beginning I have a few
products here that still might be under
embargo for just a few more days or
something like that I actually can't
show you what's in these boxes but I'm
gonna open them up anyway look at that
though check that out I bet you guys are
very curious what that is leave me your
guesses in the comments section one more
box of mystery here that's will remain a
mystery for now what's that I don't know
you you guys could probably figure it
out let's move on to something I can
show you guys once again this box if
it's not evident is from ASIS and once
again I have a least a vague idea of
what's in here
they should be motherboards yay
motherboards X 570 motherboards to be
specific they have sent me a couple I
thought they were sending me the tough
one but that's fine they sent they sent
me the X 570 Pro the prime X 570 Pro and
the RG Strix X 570 - e gaming so these
boards are not the cheapest they're not
the most expensive either I mean you got
to keep in mind that the X 570 boards go
up to like 700 bucks each for the really
high-end ones X 570 Pro those coming in
at 250 dollars the XS 70 - e gaming ROG
Strix Edition is about three hundred and
thirty dollars at least that's according
to the current prices on new egg I'm
going to quickly just pop each one out
to give you guys a closer look since we
do have this lovely top-down camera to
see that sort of thing so a cursory look
here shows us some heat sinks that
actually have some splits in them so
that should provide some additional
surface area so hopefully that's good
for power delivery for the ex-wife so
many boards from what I've read about
and looked at so far it's pretty much
solved across the board so especially if
you're going for
iron bird like this nothing to worry
about there of course you do want to
make sure it stays cool it does have a
fixed IO shield which is becoming kind
of ubiquitous these days which i think
is kind of nice you've got a front USB
3.1 gen2 header or as they're calling it
3.2 Gen 2 because you know that's not
confusing no backplate or anything like
that to speak of but I would imagine
that this has some pretty fancy RGB
lights up here in the Strix area and it
also has some covers here with some heat
sinks for your m2s which are those are
those are metal heat sinks as well so a
pretty nice looking board at first
glance I've got some of the higher-end
features like a debug LEDs or their
surface mounted power and reset buttons
no really a sues for $330 you're not
gonna give me service amount of power
and reset buttons I complain about that
alright so if I if I'm gonna critique
this board again just a first first
glance critique I would like surface
mounted power and reset buttons I feel
like that'd be nice it does have an
external USB bass flash back button
there though so that's handy and it does
have the BIOS flash flashback
functionality which means we can flash
the BIOS without necessarily needing to
have a CPU or memory installed oh also a
dual NICs one of them being 2.5 gigs so
that's a nice upgrade too and now let's
take a quick look at the $250 issues
prime X 570 - bro this one's sticking
with the black-and-white color scheme
that the prime series has been using for
quite some time slightly cut down
features here not as many heat sinks
going over the m-dot 2 slots for example
you still have the USB 3.1 gen2 front
panel headers so I do appreciate that
looks like you still have some decent
heat sinks here that are fairly solid
large blocks of metal that have some
grooves in there to add some surface
area again the fixed IO shield which
also has plastic heat covering on it
there you go a quick look at the back of
the board not much to speak of there but
yeah again we have what appears to be a
pretty solid layout missing a few
features that again you might expect for
a higher end 250 ish dollar motherboard
I would like again to see maybe a debug
LED surface mount of power and reset
buttons those are convenient to have you
don't have the external USB BIOS flash
back button on this board either and
then a feature or a deterring factor for
all X 570 motherboards pretty much is
that it does have a chipset heat sink
fan there's a little mini fan there for
the
chipsets could potentially make some
noise I haven't done like an extensive
testing of the chipset heatsink fans on
x5 70 but it is something that's there
and that's something that if you do want
to avoid you have to spend a lot of
money on because the only motherboard
that doesn't have that is the Auris x5
70 master which is one of these $700
motherboards but there it is guys let me
know in the comments what you think of
these two motherboard offerings from
Asus I have a feeling that I will
integrate at least one of them into a
build sim oh this this next one this
this one's special guys I've been
holding on to this actually for a little
while
sent over by MSI if you can't tell from
the tape there should be multiple things
in this box and all of them are good
remember I was talking about expensive
XY of 70 motherboards there's one that's
the x5 70 God like from MSI Meg or MSI
extreme gaming this is their highest and
x5 70 motherboard and yes retail price
for this at launch 700 freaking dollars
is it worth that much I don't know I'll
leave that up to you guys but point is
it's an overkill motherboard and yes I'm
gonna do a build with it because why not
I've got it here so I should use it look
it's got one of those these fun flaps
that you can open up to look at the
inside before you even take it out of
the box and everything like what makes
this special we got Gen 4 of course BCI
agent 4 but I mean let's face it even
the entry-level X 5 70 motherboard
support that latest networking solution
with a killer 2.5 Gigabit LAN
connections as well as Wi-Fi 6 that's
nice we also have there froze our
heatsink so double ball-bearing little
fan I try to avoid little fans on
chipset heat sinks at least my past
experience with them has never been that
great but this does have 0 frozer which
means that the fan won't spin unless it
needs to I'll hopefully determine how
often that is actually required 14 + 4 +
1 phase power delivery so that's nice
mystic light infinity to view screen a
lot of these features are also available
on the Meg X 578 that I already did a
build with so check that board out if
you don't want to spend seven hundred
bucks on this one also a dynamic
dashboard which is a display that's on
there so that that should be fun to
check out as well
one last key item to point out here will
be the m-dot to expander to Gen 4 so it
does have a riser card here that you can
add MDOT to nvme SSDs to so if you're
looking for a crazy nvme SSD
configuration then that riser card is a
useful add-on let's quickly hopefully
quickly look at this board here the
accessories that come with it you have a
Wi-Fi antenna you've got a pouch of
cables so here's that MDOT to expanders
II gen for expansion card which actually
supports two additional m dot two slots
so if you're looking at the board itself
you have one two and three couple of
those are gonna be from the chipset
probably the top one is connected
directly to the the CPU itself but I
would need to double check the manual to
confirm that and then you can add two
more m dot two PCIe Gen 4 slots with
this expansion card which has a massive
heatsink on the top as well as an active
cooling fan so especially if you've got
PCIe gen for nvme SSDs that are
generating a lot of heat this would
probably be a good home for them and
that allows you to put up to five of
those super high speed PCIe Gen four
devices on the same board the board
itself is EA T X so it's a bit wider
this way than a standard ATX motherboard
you've got a USB 3.1 gen2 front panel
header as well as a couple USB 3.0
headers there looks like there's there's
lots of space on the board again that
zero frozer feature on the heat sink fan
that's underneath a little sticker right
there some MSI dragon accent logos and
then you're going to have that infinity
mirror effect for the RGB lights here by
the i/o as well
there's IO fixed panel this is again
just I really like that feature glad
that it's becoming something that's
everywhere oh and the hey MSI thanks for
including the surface mounted power and
reset buttons if you didn't on your
flagship board I would be very
disappointed but I'm glad you've
included those we've also got a lot of
work they put into the audio for this
they've got dual eight pin inputs for
the power delivery for the motor
motherboard itself they've added a heat
pipe that goes from the chipset up here
to sort of integrate all the heat sinks
on the board so wherever you might have
hot spots that will hopefully help
distribute the heat between those to
disperse it a bit more easily and
efficiently I was kind of hoping they
might have gone with a backplate on this
board but honestly that's not something
that you really see so that's probably
not a huge deal that that's not included
but there is a quick first look at the
msi mag x5 70 god-like motherboard which
i am going to be doing it build with but
of course we're going to need to pair
this up with some pretty high-end
components otherwise which means not
the motherboard the CPU of course which
for now is going to be the 3900 X and
then maybe some graphics cards might
also be good to have about our TX 2080
TI's about to RTX 2080 T eyes how about
the msi Seahawk our TX 20 ATT eyes which
if water blocks pre-installed okay so
you guys might have if you watch my
channel you might have seen me teasing
some stuff with the msi lightning RTX 20
ATI because I did have one of those and
actually managed to steal Kyle's as well
and that was the original plan I was
going to water cool both of those cards
and make a super crazy high-end system
unfortunately the Lightning card is so
difficult to find and just was made in
such limited numbers that there doesn't
seem to be any water block companies or
the companies that produce water blocks
that made water blocks for it so talk to
msi about it fold in my plans and they
said well we like your idea and guess
what we happen to make the Seahawk EK
edition version of the r-tx 28 yeah ek
means that the water blocks on these
were designed by EK w b UK water blocks
leverage before very high-end high
quality water cooling components that
they put together so look I don't even
have to like do the water block
installation or everything anything when
I put this whole system together there's
a couple other things about this system
itself that are very exciting for
example the case I'm gonna use which I
haven't specified at all I've teased it
but it's been delayed to August but
we're looking at mid August and I will
hopefully be working with the
singularity computers Spectre 2.0 which
is an insane $1200 case that has
manifold manifolds built-in for water
cooling and everything if you guys saw
the system that J put together for post
Malone that was using an earlier
variants of the spectre 2.0 that they of
course custom made specifically for post
alone and everything beer bongs and
Bentley's and all that good stuff so I'm
gonna be working I think with the retail
version of it but that won't come till
next month but that doesn't mean that
I'm not going to get the parts for this
build all going and ready but here it is
though the seahawk EK version of msi is
RTX 2080 TI i don't know a whole lot to
say about this i'm actually not
intimately familiar with what EK and/or
m
I have done to make this card special
and unique I just know that it looks
pretty badass right out of the gates we
have some carbon-fiber accents on the
MSI logo areas right there there is a
clear area where you can look through to
see the liquid flowing through the
terminal here is already pre-mounted and
of course is going to have access points
on both the top or the bottom so
depending on how the loop is configured
that provides a little bit of
flexibility there it is definitely a
very wide card I mean you have to
imagine from the PCIe bracket right here
there's an extra inch or so added just
from the pc because this is MSI's PCB
where they shrunk down the connector
point here for the NV link SLI bridge
but then the PCB goes back out here to
give them a little bit more area for
adding whatever components they wanted
to add there we have dual eight pin PCI
Express power connectors as well as a
six pin which is the most I've ever seen
on any arch GX 20 atti
except for the Lightning the Lightning
has three eight pin power connectors so
this is almost almost as crazy as that
one when it comes to the power delivery
configuration we have a very classy
looking backplate here as well I would
say featuring both MSI and ek logos bit
of the MSI dragon there some brushed
metal finish just just a really cool
looking card and even though it's like
you could look at the PCB design and be
like that's slightly awkward because
it's sort of the stair step that it's
got going on but I think it's also kind
of unique it makes you kind of double
take out and be like wait what what
graphics card is that again the i/o in
case you're wondering is pretty much
standard similar to all the RTI x20 ATT
eyes with three display ports an HDMI
and the USB type-c which can also work
for VR link and I think that's pretty
much all I have to show for this card
right now of course there's two of these
the other ones the same so I'm not going
to bother to unbox that one as well and
honestly if there was one main reason I
was going to make this unboxing video
today it was to give you guys some
further teasing of this build that I've
been sort of getting together over the
past month or two it is getting a lot
closer to being ready to go although I
do need to wait until next month to get
the case to put everything together in I
might do some early setup and testing
with the parts that I already have but
we have to sort of wait and see for that
and then hopefully eventually will drop
the 3950 x into this bill because why
bother with the twelve
or when you've got a 16 core available
so let me know in the comments what you
guys think of this system if you have
any suggestions for me I'm always
looking for ways that I can make an epic
water-cooled build like this unique
maybe a good name anything like that
leave me that in the comment section
down below I think I have one more thing
to unbox actually two more boxes to
unbox the largest this one was one of
the ones that I was also not completely
sure I could show you guys yet but I
have gotten special permission to show
this to you guys a little bit early I
won't say that earliest because this is
all the product from NZ XP and it's
something that they already were showing
up at Computex so if you guys are
watching Computex coverage which I did
not do this year you might have seen
this so there it is the H 510 now what I
asked NZXT for was the regular H 510
which is going to be a reasonably priced
case I don't know that the price off the
top of my head this is the elite which
has some extra stuff going on like a
controller for some RGB stuff and
otherwise that you can connect up to
NZXT cam so this one is more expensive
but essentially the case and the
interior is the same as the standard H
510 so you can sort of see it as either
one but they wanted to be to show off
the elites so that is what I am going to
be using for a build coming very soon
which is supposed to be sort of a more
mid-range reasonable rise in 3000 series
builds which I wanted to look very
pretty so this seemed like a reasonable
case to use so there it is guys I was
just planning to take this out of the
box real quick again since this is early
and I can't really give you review
pointers or anything like it like that's
NZXT has asked me to refrain from
anything beyond just simply showing it
so like you guys know that I have it's
and that it will be used in a bill very
soon so let me know what you think first
impressions and stay tuned for the build
coming at you ASAP I hope the other
thing is that I have one more box to
open which is the largest one which has
been right here this whole time so if
I'm being honest this box did not it's
really not tech related but it's a big
box so I thought I'd open it on this
video anyway it's here I need to open it
just arrived if you guys are interested
what's in here
did you guys know what this is it's a
ramp it's actually made for dogs or I
guess other animals to get in and out of
cars and if you guys are familiar with
my dogs we have to Hiro and nori Hiro is
getting on in ears and he's having a
much harder time jumping in and out of
the car when we go to the park and stuff
so we determined a ramp would be a good
option for him so he can still go with
us on those little excursions which he
