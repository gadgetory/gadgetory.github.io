my CES 2017 coverage from Las Vegas
Nevada I am here at the Toshiba Suites
I'm actually going to be looking at some
ocz products right here because OCC is
of course a Toshiba company I need to
start off by thanking my sponsors for
CES 2017 gigabyte deep cool and of
course Toshiba let's start off with a
quick rundown of these SSDs that they
have now these are all available for
sale of course so you could purchase
them right now but if you're not already
familiar ocz has the TL 100 first off
over here on the left side this is a
SATA 6 gigabits per second drive 2.5
inch available in 120 and 240 gig
capacities sequential reads and writes
up in the 550 and 530 megabytes per
second range 85 thousand and eighty
thousand ieps respectively for random
reads and random writes so this is going
to be a solid all-around drive for you
guys if you're a little a little bit
more of a budget you could probably get
this for a little bit better price but
that is using TLC memory so triple level
cell and it also does not have a dram
cache so if you know what that means
then that might mean something to you if
you don't I'm not going to bother to
explain it here this is show coverage we
don't go into that much detail next up
is the OCC TR 150 also a 2.5 inch little
SSD looks pretty cool nice silver finish
on these also by the way which i think
is nice
my camera will focus of course so I
should blend in with the system some
blue accents on there as well and I like
I like the OCC design I think they do a
good job with that the TR 150 is of
course also SATA 6 K but gigabit per
second 120 240 480 and 960 gigabyte
capacities 550 megabytes per second and
530 megabytes per second reads and
writes and up to 90 thousand I ops reads
64,000 I ops writes and that one is sort
of a step up from the TL 100 to the TR
150 this one is getting into the high
end at least when it comes to the SATA
drives this is the OC zvx 500 series
which has a little bit more and I want
to say aggressive design here it's got a
little bit of a texture there an actual
finish for the housing and then of
course well usually there's a label on
the back with the specs and stuff but
that's alright the specs are right here
this is again of course 6k
a bit per second drive so it is going to
be slightly limited by the SATA bus
this is using mlc nand flash memory so
two bits per cell which is a considered
by some to be a little bit higher end
than TLC stuff it can be faster in some
consider in some situations and possibly
have more endurance but you do get five
hundred fifty megabytes per second reads
515 megabytes per second writes 92,000
apps on the reads and sixty-five
thousand i ups on the writes at least if
you're doing 4k stuff of course but then
we have this guy over here which is my
favorite at least of this bunch because
it's an nvme and dot - SSD so this is
the Rd 400 and it comes not just with
the m2 SSD itself but also with a very
convenient riser card so PCI Express you
can just plug it in there to one of your
PCI expansion slots provided you haven't
done a two-way SLI configuration or
something you don't have enough slots
ready to go or if you have an MDOT - you
can pop this into that now they have
added a little bit of cooling via a
thermal pad there at the bottom to help
to keep things cool but I have been told
by OCC that these drives do not suffer
from thermal throttling throttling
except in the very most extreme
situations so you should be fine unless
you're sticking it right under a
graphics card or something like that
this is PCI Express gen3 by for nvm nvm
a one point one be compliance I don't
know what that means all I know is that
of nvme I'm going to have to look at the
standards and what the differences
between them comes with that adding card
adapter that's optional to achieve a
controller Toshiba mlc nand flash
available in capacities up to one
terabyte a five-year warranty program
actually there's a five-year warranty
for this drive as well as the last VX
500 drive the other drives I just showed
you have three year warranties and then
reads 26 50 megabytes per second 2.6
gigs per sec can I say per sec I don't I
just shortened the word seconds that's
not really necessary up to 1600
megabytes per second writes and then
random reads into 230,000 IAP range and
random writes in 150,000 app range so if
you want some fast storage get like two
of these and raid them and that would be
cool but don't do it don't do it on the
z2 70
seventy platform you need you need x99
for that or maybe one of the new AMD AMD
rising chipsets I don't know why I'm
talking about that I'm just speculating
here's some enterprise products that
they have on display probably out of the
range of most of you guys but still fun
to look at it's also velcroed down so
I'm just going to pick the whole thing
up
this is an SSD it's got a fat heatsink
on it and it's available in capacities
up to four terabytes
it's the px 0 4 and again probably not
going to grab this for like an at-home
use situation but hey some of you guys
might be into enterprise stuff so check
that out there's hk4 it's a SAS SSD
capacities in the 200 gig although up to
1920 gigabyte range just shy of 2
terabytes and then a PCI Express version
of the px 0 for the PX 0 for P which
also I like when SSDs have to have heat
sinks on them that means that they're
fast at least in my experience finally
here we have the BG series this is
listed as client ultra mobile nvme which
is these are designed for OEM so they're
not quite as pretty as far as like the
darker PCBs or anything like that but
you have this chip that's been
integrated on this down to this m dot 2
which is an MDOT to 2230 which is the
shortest MDOT to drive that I've ever
seen and then we also have some other
integrations over here but look at this
ignore the velcro on the back but this
is basically just a little little chip
that is an SSD yes that little chip
right there has the SSD controller as
well as the NAND integrated and right
now these are these they can make these
in a 512 gig capacity so this little
chip I'm holding in my hand is not just
like a 512 gig man chip it's also the
controller unlike everything you'd need
for the entire SSD so you could like
take this and solder it directly onto
the PCB of like a laptop or something
like that or you can do what they did
and drop it on to just like the tiniest
little m dot to drive possible which I
thought was pretty cool they actually
have a demo unit of this going so let's
check that out so here's a demo system
they have set up that was sent over by
origin and that little m dot to drive
just chillin there right right down on
the bottom right hand corner of the
board it is again so small that like
spec wise it doesn't actually
yep so it's kind of floating there but I
think it looks very cute and just to
show you guys who haven't already
experienced the difference when it comes
to something like load times this is
doom loading off of that little SSD and
it should take just a moment or two
because you know doom load times they
can be very very time-consuming and now
it's ready to go that was quick
if you guys have ever tried to load do
them off of like a hard drive or even
like a slower SSD it can take forever so
really cool I like having the
availability of really really tiny SSDs
there are lots of fun I am going to
close off this video though guys so if
you enjoyed it hit the thumbs up button
of course thanks again to my sponsors
gigabytes as well as ocz to Toshiba as
well as deep cool thanks for watching
again guys the thumbs up bun and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
