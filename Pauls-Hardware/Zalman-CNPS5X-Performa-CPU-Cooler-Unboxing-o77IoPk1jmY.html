today I'm going to be doing a quick
unboxing an overview of this Zelman CMPs
5x Performa cpu cooler let's take a
closer look at the Zalman CMPs 5x
Performa as you can see power cooling
performance direct touch heat pipe ultra
quiet pwm fan now this is more of a
budget aftermarket CPU heatsink fan and
I will I will say that I like it I like
this one I've used it a few times
already and I like its simplicity I
would not recommend using this if you're
going to be doing serious overclocking
but if you want something simple
something effective and as something as
previously mentioned quiets this is
definitely a good option so I kind of
have been turning the box over and over
here but I didn't want to stop at least
here really quick on specs I hope you
guys can read those I don't have a macro
lens yet but I'm I will eventually
that's first off dimensions mainly the
height is what you would be worried
about they 134 millimeters it should fit
in the majority of computer cases unless
you're going something really slim or
small form-factor
320 gram weight pure copper and pure
aluminum construction the fan is 92
millimeter basically so 92 millimeter
fan fluid shield-bearing spins between
1,350 and 27 hundred rpms plus or minus
10 percent noise level of between 20 and
32 DB and it's got a four pin peda
pwm connector which is the type of
connector you'll have for the vast
majority have CPU connections also PWM
capable as already mentioned alright a
little bit more info on the back here
the english again hope you guys can read
that powerful cooling performance
heatsink design for optimal airflow high
performance super thermal grease
included it's got direct touch heat pipe
technology so the heat pipes make direct
contact shark's fin blades on the 92
millimeter fan compatible with various
Intel and AMD sockets they're not
telling you specifically here but I can
tell you this is compatible with the
majority of sockets that are out right
now so that includes back to 770 LGA 775
for Intel also includes LGA 1156 and
1155 does not include
with LGA 2011 and I don't think you'd be
buying this heatsink fans who put on a
LGA 2011 processor anyway but bear that
in mind and then for AMD pretty much
everything and 2 M 2 plus M 3 M 3 plus
as well as the FM 1 &amp;amp; FM two sockets
that's another thing I like about this
particular heat sink fan and I'm just
showing you some of the pictures on the
side but I like that it actually uses
the default brackets on AMD processor so
you don't have to remove the backplate
and that might be because simply because
I tend to swap a lot of a lot more
heatsink fans out than maybe any any
person in their right mind but I like
that you can just drop this onto an AMD
system without having to remove that
backplate alright so there they getting
more specific about the info I already
told you as far as the compatibility
with different sockets here's the users
manual just give you a quick scan
through here they've done a pretty good
job with it making sure that they've got
labels they've got some nice purple
arrows they're telling you which way to
direct the airflow very handy and then
installation instructions are not going
to go through all those but give you
guys a better idea of their quality I'm
looking for something to cut with my
knife here for this unboxing that's what
I got it for was unboxings but oh well
alright so here's a retention ring so
this is used for both the AMD as well as
the Intel installations this one
actually kind of favors
well the latches on the cooler itself
are set up for AMD mostly and then if
you have Intel you actually use this on
the four mounting points that most Intel
sockets have and then snap it on-site at
either side kind of more similar to an
Andy installation you get a baggie of
these little dips which are guys and
those those are the plungers you drop
into these little holes to secure it for
Intel installations you get a little a
little kind of 1:1 one-time-use thing of
super thermal grease there from Zalman
so there's your mounting hardware or at
least most of it again that's the ring
is only needed for intel intel socket
all right and then here is the cooler
here is some delicious silica gel
forbidden you must not eat it alright so
here's a closer look at the cooler so 92
millimeter fan there in front nice
aluminum thinner a it's got a black
plastic shroud kind of around that CPU
cooler it's got the Zalman logo on it so
most of the time you're gonna have it
positioned like that in your case and
that's gonna be the back of your case
will be that direction and you'll be
able to see the Zalman logo although it
will go side to side or up and down
instead of up and down a bit really
really who minds that much about that
alright alright so there's your copper
heat pipes as you can see you got a
total of three of them and you can see
the termination of all those there at
the end
aluminum fin array again and then up
here we can see the direct heat pipe
contact right there so that has proven
to be a very effective way for heatsink
fans to help wick the heat away from the
CPU heat spreader and then on the sides
here you simply have these two little
latches as you can see it's kind of
situated for an AMD configuration right
now with the latches on either side but
it's pretty easy you just get a Phillips
head down there loosen that a position I
believe the outer position actually is
for AMD and then inner position is to
use along with the ring latch on either
side but very easy to install this
particular heat sink fan the most times
I've done it I'm trying to pull out the
pwm cable as well but it's actually
tucked back in there pretty good okay
here we go
PWM cable there you have it for pin
brightly coloured cable not my favorite
on the brightly colored cable but what
can you do and that pretty much does it
so this has been my quick unboxing of
the Zalman CNP s5x Performa aftermarket
heat sink fan for Intel and AMD CPUs
