process I go through sometimes when the
conceiving of a new video to make this
one in particular I have three things
that I had on my mind the first one is
that after about a week plus of intense
benchmarking because we had several new
product launches graphics cards over
here new processors I am left with a
very familiar situation here in my
garage which is that it is a crazy mess
I'm not even gonna show you the whole
thing but believe me it's a mess I got
testbeds lying around and otherwise the
second factor is just the reality that I
really have too much stuff it's not
really what I would call a problem it's
more of a dilemma I am very grateful and
honestly blessed that I get so much
stuff arriving that I get to test out
and make videos about but it also adds
up over time and at a certain point I'm
like what do I do with all of this stuff
that I have that leads me to the third
leg of my logic for this video which is
that monitor behind me if you missed the
video on that I gave a brief explanation
at the beginning of that of a new
persona a new identity that I am
inhabiting sometimes a mr. Hyde to my
dr. Jekyll if you will which is the I
don't give a version of fall that
persona was inspired by Jay of Jays two
cents so blame him my goal is to spread
cynicism lack of caring for others
wherever I go but in that general spirit
I have conceived of today's video which
is basically gonna be just me selling a
bunch of stuff to you guys so yes you
guys heard me right rather than do a
giveaway or donation or otherwise figure
out a way how to dispose of some of this
stuff I am just gonna be selling it to
you on eBay so feel free to check the
video description for all the links to
all of the eBay sales that I am posting
up today and the Paul's Hardware summer
sale or whatever the heck I'm gonna
decide to call this but here's my mo for
today I'm gonna come out to the garage
I'm gonna look around I'm gonna find
stuff that I can part with a lot of the
stuff is gonna be from over here older
stuff if you're looking for like rising
3rd gen or anything like that that's not
gonna be for sale today because I do
still need that stuff I will then take
the chosen product out of my garage and
over here into my dining room because
one of the other dilemmas I didn't
mention in the intro is that it's really
hot today
and while I do have AC in the garage it
tends to get a little strained
especially later in the afternoon when
it gets up to a hundred degrees freedom
units here in California which it is
supposed to hit today so over here will
be my photography area I'll be setting
up all the actions on my laptop
right here I have a tape gun yay
tape gun I have a bunch of boxes back
here that I've been saving it for the
past week or so I've got the tape gun so
I can tape everything up and get it
packed and ready to ship out and then I
guess that's everything
so guys stick around if you want to see
me highlight some of the products that
will be going up for sale today it is
gonna be international sales but if you
are international you are responsible
for paying shipping as well as any taxes
and import fees and duties because I
can't handle all that
so by here on risk if you are
international so do check how much the
cost is going to be if you are buying
from an international location beyond
that I'll profits and proceeds are going
straight to me which I have no qualms
lists because it's my stuff I'm selling
it deal with it that's opposed I will
probably maybe spend some of the money
on my daughter that would that would be
a good thing to do maybe my wife to even
that said though guys I'm gonna get
started so stick around and let's see
what I have up for sale today our first
item is the asus mg279q monitor this is
a 27 inch IPS 144 Kurtz for millisecond
response time freesync monitor it is
wqhd or 2560 by 1440 resolution LED
backlight and freesync support so it is
yes a gaming monitor I do need to point
out that there is a minor display glitch
with this monitor it is used
occasionally there is a horizontal
artifact line that appears but it really
is pretty random so only a minor
irritation that pops up every once in a
while it is by and large ok for gaming
and other use and I think anyone would
be happy with it especially with this
starting price of $20 our next item is
an Air Max aqua fusion 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid CPU cooler model ELC
aqf 240 SQ a with addressable RGB
lighting and setup for intel or AMD cpu
platforms it includes a unique RGB water
block with a glossy acrylic cover and a
luminous or a belt RGB illumination
feature this is brand new it's still
sealed in the box our third item is the
ROG Strix fusion 500 virtual 7.1 LED
gaming headset it has a high 5 grade ESS
DAC ESS amplifier a digital microphone
and Ora sync RGB lighting this is also
brand-new and sealed in the box with a
starting bid of $20 next up is the inner
max liquid fusion RGB 240 millimeter all
in one liquid CPU cooler model ELC LF
240 RGB this RGB 240 millimeter
has a patented flow indicator design and
RGB control box included made for Intel
or AMD CPUs and has only been used for
photo and video used so far so very very
light usage basically just been taken
out of the box starting bid of 15
dollars next we have a cooler master CK
5:30 10 keyless gaming mechanical
keyboard with blue switches not cherry
but they do have a blue switch feel this
keyboard features RGB backlighting on
the flight controls and an aluminum top
plate it's only been used for photo and
video so far starting price of $15 next
we have another cooler master keyboard
this time the mk7 30 10 keyless gaming
mechanical keyboard with cherry MX red
switches features RGB / key lighting and
a removable wrist rest again only used
so far for photo and video so very light
usage only $20 starting bit next up here
we have a combo a cooler master mm 830
mouse and an MP 860 RGB mouse pad so you
get both of them with this action the
gaming mouse has a 24,000 dpi sensor
hidden d-pad buttons for zone RGB
lighting and a precision wheel whereas
the mousepad has a dual sided feature
and RGB illumination again only used for
photo and video so far $20 starting bid
I think a lot of you will be interested
in our 8 auction this is an msi armor
geforce r-tx 2070 graphics card with 8
gigs of GDD are 6 memory
this is MSI's entry-level but still very
powerful version of the r-tx 2070 with a
dual fan cooler featuring a 256 bit 8
gig GD d r 6 memory array hdmi
displayport and USB outs as well as very
tracing support thanks to it stirring
architecture this card has been lightly
used for some comparison testing and it
starts at $100 next we have an asus rog
Strix Radeon rx Vega 64 8 gig graphics
card with 8 gigs of hvm to memory this
is part of the ROG Strix lineup so it
features their unique RGB lighting
design on the cooling shroud features
PCI Express 3.0 connectivity it is HDCP
ready the model is Strix rx Vegas 64 0
8g gaming in case you're wondering and
again only light use on this for
comparison testing our next item is a
power supply and this one has been used
a bit more extensively this is the
cooler master v6 50 it's 80 plus gold
rated for efficiency and it is fully
modular feature
all black cables and Japanese capacitors
again this has been a standby power
supply I've used it in multiple builds
but it's never had a problem before
still fully functional with light usage
starting price of $15 next is the asus
prime x2 99 deluxe 2 which is an x 299
chipset LGA 2066
motherboard for high-end desktop intel
core X series CPUs it has an ATX form
factor 8 ddr4 dimm slots n dot 2 and u
dot to support as well as Thunderbolt 3
USB 3.1 dual Gigabit LAN ports and a tow
2.11 AC Wi-Fi built in again only
extremely light usage on this port for
photo and video use I basically did an
unboxing with it starting price of $75
here's another motherboard the asus
prime z 370 - a which is an LGA 1151
motherboard for mainstream intel series
processors z 370 - a features for ddr4
dimm slots display port HDMI and DVI
outs as well as m dot 2 USB 3.1 and of
course that Z 370 chipset it's an ATX
form factor motherboard it has only been
used once it was put together in a
single build tested fully functional
starting bid of $30 next we have some
memory kits we're starting with the
avexir Raiden 16 gig kit that's 4 by 4
gig dims it's a ddr4 3000 kit and this
one does feature the avexir Raiden a
unique plasma lighting feature across
the top which is a really cool effect
although I will warn you it does make a
light bit of electrical noise it's a
decently fast kit rated at ddr4 3000 the
model number is listed in the
description and it has only been used in
one build for a single video starting
price of $20 our next memory kit is from
giel it's the evo x RGB kit 16 gigs or 2
by 8 gig sticks ddr4 3200 cast latency
16
this is an ideal kit for use with rising
especially 1st or 2nd generation it's
cast latency 16 so pretty decent timings
the model number again is linked in the
description and this is basically brand
new it's never been used although I did
open up the box to take a look at it
starting bid of $20 next we have a
Corsair Vengeance
led kits this is a 32 gig kit for 8 gig
sticks not RGB LED but it does have
white LEDs across the top rated speed
for ddr4 2666 and the model number again
is listed in the description this has
been used a few times and a few
but it's fully functional with a
starting bid of $40 our next memory kit
is a Corsair Vengeance RGB kit 16 gigs
or 2 by 8 gig dims ddr4 3000 for the
speed cast latency 15 and yes
vengeance RGB means it does have
vengeance RGB lighting so if you want to
RGB then this kit has it it has been
used in a few builds as well but it's
perfectly functional and a starting bid
of $25 next we have another power supply
that has been an old standby this is the
Rosewill Tachyon 1,000 watt 80 +
platinum rated power supply it's fully
modular all the cables are included as
well as the power plug the model is
Tachyon - 1000 and while this model
isn't sold anymore it's been absolutely
rock-solid in my testing so it will work
out just fine for anyone just bear in
mind it does have ketchup and mustard
cables although I did wrap some black
tape around part of it it may be a bit
dusty but for a fully functional 1000
watt 80-plus platinum power supply i
think $20 is a fair starting bid
here's another well used product this is
the Blackmagic intensity Pro 1080p
capture card it does 1080p at 30 frames
per second and it needs a PCI Express
slot again this is used and used
extensively it's probably seven or eight
plus years old but it's always worked
great the only issues I've really had
with it have been due to the black magic
software so for a $5 starting bid if
you've been looking for a 1080p capture
card this might do it for you next is a
couple more black magic products these
have been used but more lately this is
actually a 2 item combo the deck link
mini recorder 4k PCIe capture card and
the mini monitor 4k PCIe capture card I
was originally trying to use these for
loopback but the mini monitor capture
card is actually made to use along with
software so if you're using something
like Adobe Premiere you can use that for
an output to a 4k monitor to watch the
project that you're working on you
cannot use it for live pass-through for
the 4k capture card to watch gameplay or
something like that so please don't buy
it with that purpose but these cards do
retail for about $200 each right now and
the 4k capture card always worked great
for me for capturing a video feed from
my GH 4 or th 5 cameras so you might
want it for that too anyway starting bid
is 10 bucks and our last item is what
I'm going to call a grab bag this is a
bunch of individual items but I think it
adds up to a pretty nice combo starting
with the coolermaster Devastator 3 which
is a gaming keyboard and mouse
combo in and of itself we also have a
Toshiba XS 700 240 gigabyte external SSD
and enter max fan icer which i think is
supposed to keep your laptop cool or
something like that there's a boltron
wireless charging pad for tubes of
corsair TM 30 thermal paste and then
three mouse beds because we all need
three mouse pads one from HyperX one
from main gear and one from corsair all
of this for the low low starting auction
price of five dollars all right guys
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
today's video again check the
description for links to all the
auctions and whatnot that are available
today and I'm probably not gonna do this
again this just seems kind of like a
one-off thing to me but let me know in
the comment section down below what you
think of this if you think I'm just a
horrible person for doing it or you
think you know I should go for it and
maybe make this a regular deal
I don't know I'm really not sure what
I'm gonna do about it but for now I've
gone ahead with it so thanks for
sticking with it I'll be back with more
regular content coming at you very soon
hit the thumbs up button anyway else and
we'll see you guys in the next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
