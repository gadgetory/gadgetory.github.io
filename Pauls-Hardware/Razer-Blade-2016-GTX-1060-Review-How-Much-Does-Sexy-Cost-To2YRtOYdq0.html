model updated in late 2016 to add
Nvidia's Pascal based GTX 1066 Giga
graphics card to the mix a full desktop
classic GPU and not a stupid mobile GPU
of mind you the version that razer sent
over for me to review features a skylake
i7 6700 HQ quad-core cpu with hyper
threading a 14 inch IPS 1920 by 1080
matte screen a 512 gig SSD and 16 gigs
of DDR 4 memory all somehow wedged into
this 0.7 inch thick CNC milled aluminum
chassis and weighing just 4.16 pounds
but I'm a desktop guy and sexy thin
notebooks like this are always
overpriced this one happens to cost two
grand and its current configuration or
you can pay 200 bucks less for one with
a 256 gig SSD or 400 dollars more for
one with a one terabyte SSD too large is
a lot of money to spend on a computer
especially when you consider how for the
rest of this video I'm going to be
comparing this razor blade to a desktop
build just in an attempts to determine
how much of a premium you have to pay
for the convenience of portability and I
guess sexiness - let's finish off specs
and features though that 6700 HQ CPU can
turbo up to 3.5 gigahertz on a single
core but it will run at 3.1 gigahertz
turbo when using all four cores the 70
watt hour battery will last for about 6
hours during media playback web surfing
and about three to four hours while
gaming depending on what game you're
playing of course and as expected you
get an eight-oh 2.11 AC Wi-Fi and
bluetooth 4.1 module via a killer NIC
and I very much appreciate that you can
actually access the internals of the
Razer Blade by removing the 10 t5 screws
and popping off the bottom plate which
means you could potentially update that
m2 SSD in there and perhaps even the
Wi-Fi card if you really felt you need
to in the future physically the blade is
just pretty badass I have to admit the
flat black finish is beautiful and it
stays cool to the touch while not in use
at least the design is simple and
elegant with a couple ridges right
across the top and a cutout across the
front that makes lifting the lid a
little bit easier rubber strips on the
bottom provides some spacing for the two
Fanning takes down there but these can
get starved for air unless the blade is
on a
a flat surface finally there is that
glowing razor triple snakehead logo
which I still can't decide if I love or
a hate please help me decide by arguing
for or against it in the comment section
down below since this is a fourteen inch
laptop the body size is small just
thirteen point six by nine point three
by 0.7 inches and for connectivity
you've got three green accented USB 3.0
ports and a USB type-c port that is both
USB 3.1 and the Thunderbolt three
compatible so it can also be used to
hook up the cool but also very expensive
razor core external GPU enclosure if
that 1060 isn't doing it for you there's
also power in headphone mic jacks on the
left side and an HDMI out and Kensington
lock on the right side also really
missing here is an SD card slot in my
professional opinion opening the blade
starts the fans spinning and they will
continue spinning and making some noise
even at idle under load the fan noise
can get quite loud but more on that when
the testing happens I do like the
individual left and right click buttons
on the trackpad but the trackpad
performance itself is just okay it's
simply not as responsive as it could be
but the software has settings that you
can adjust in the OS did help a bit
bring a mouse if you're going to gain I
guess is what I'm saying the keyboard is
also adequate with decent travel for
chiclet style keys with scissor switches
so I didn't have much trouble with that
but I do like the chroma RGB lighting
it's a very nice touch and it can be
customized if you want I also like the
backlit keyboard because it's especially
nice for gaming in a dark environment
they have decent sounding stereo
speakers that can be found on the left
and right side of the keyboard and
there's an integrated webcam up on top
lastly there is the screen itself on the
plus side it is 1920 by 1080 and matte I
prefer matte to glossy any day of the
week and 1080 is just fine for a 14 inch
display while also aligning with what
the GTX 1060 is capable of while you're
gaming on the downside it's not a
touchscreen for that you've got an
upgrade to the Razer Blade Pro which has
a GTX 1080 and a 4k touchscreen starting
for the bargain-basement price of $3,700
good lord let's move on to some
benchmarks though so we're going to
start off with some synthetic benchmarks
3d mark of course running firestrike
extreme and I'm comparing the benchmarks
for the Razer Blade 2016
to the $750 build that I did a month or
two ago it's got an i-5 6500 so still a
quad core but not hyper-threading as
well as a full-size gtx 1066 gigabytes
in fire strike extreme overall score was
49 57 for the razorblade graphics was 52
48 physics was 95 76 and the combined
score was 23 18 if you compare that to
the full-size system you will note that
it did not score as high overall however
the physics score was much higher and I
attribute that to the hyper-threading
that's available on the 6700 HQ
processor moving on to time spy which is
a DirectX 12 test overall score was 35
14 graphics was 34 59 CPU was 38 64 I
was again able to beat those overall
scores with the $750 build that I did
last month
however again you can see the CPU score
the Razer Blade 2016 outperforming again
due to the availability of eight threads
moving over to GTA 5 running it at 1920
by 1080 of course average frames per
second was 78.8 on the razorblade 2016
and the minimum frames per second was
16.5 comparing this to a full-sized
stock or reference GTX 1060 that I
tested a few months back when it
launched 96.4 average FPS was what it
got there so so you'll notice the reduce
score even though we're comparing the
exact same GPU here more on that when I
come to temperature testing and what
frequency the 1060 and the razor blade
was actually running it civilization 6
I've just recently added so I don't have
much to compare this to but again
running at 1920 by 1080 in DirectX 12
mode average frame time was nineteen
point four to 99th percentile was 24
0.38 and the AI benchmark which is again
a very CPU dedicated test scored a
thirty point three three seconds average
term time the only other system I've
tested this on is the Mini ITX build
that I did last month which scored about
16 seconds for average turn time and
there it's just basically the difference
in performance that you get with the
full-size desktop CPU versus the mobile
version of the 6700 HQ finally I did a
little bit of productivity testing with
Adobe Premiere cs6 just doing some time
I'm scrubbing was again just fine with
this particular system
and when I encoded a six minute and
15-second 4k video it took just shy of
20 minutes 19 minutes and 59 seconds to
render out on the system just using the
internal SSD which is where it was
pulling the data from for the project as
well as writing the data to so I would
say overall that's pretty impressive
again when I compared it to the Mini ITX
build and the 380 T with a 6700 gain and
gtx 1070 that one did it in 15 minutes
and 29 seconds so only about 4 or 5
minutes slower than you would get with
the full-size build so that was pretty
nice - let's do a quick noise test I
hope you guys can hear me okay so right
now the system is at idle it's just been
sitting here idling and ambient
temperature is pretty cool so there is
some fan noise that I will you can
probably hear as soon as I stop talking
so not too terrible but it definitely
does make some noise even at idle but
let's load up Unigine Valley and let
things warm up and then we'll see how
how we fare so now I've been running
unit in Valley for I take a 10 to 15
minutes
everything has warmed up and the fans
are not spitting it pretty much full
speed which is pretty much what they're
going to do when you game with the
system for any extended period of time
so let's give a listen
and that is a pretty substantial amount
of noise given that it is a fairly small
laptop but again it's doing everything
it can to keep that 1060 cool now you
guys can't see it but I'll give you a
close-up in a sec the actual GPU
temperature right now is 76 degrees
Celsius and it's running at just shy of
1600 megahertz that's a big difference
between what you would get with a
desktop version of a GTX 1060 which
under load on average is going to run at
least at stock frequencies more around
1850 or so so you are losing about 200
to 250 megahertz on average of frequency
just because it's in a much smaller form
factor it's having to fight to keep
things cool a little bit more and it's
just having to throttle back that
temperature I'm sorry that frequency in
order to maintain the temperature and
keep everything smooth now the plus side
everything has been nice and smooth so
it is doing a good job there but I also
want to point out that the temperature
wear starts getting warm down in this
area which is where the GPU is
underneath the little keyboard right
there and although the area out here
starts out staying cooler it warms up so
this is a fairly subjective I'm just
using a little pointer thing to measure
temperature there at the center of the
keyboard we're getting temperatures at
least spot check temperatures around 100
and 607 degrees Fahrenheit which is
which is pretty warm not quite
comfortable if you have your hand right
on top of that now at first there was
about a 20 degrees difference when I
started going so it was about 95 in this
area and out here where it was still
staying cooler where your wrist rest
would be down to about 65 degrees
however that is now I'm sorry about 75
but that has now also warmed up so we're
hitting 87 88 there so as this center
area warms up as a GPU gets warm it's
going to warm up the rest of the chassis
again it's not like you can't use it to
play or anything like that it's just
it's work and that's something that you
should bear in mind if you are
purchasing this laptop so on the plus
side the Razer Blade gives you desktop
grade gaming and processing performance
and a form factor that's the size of
maybe a stack of a few magazines the
design is both sexy and functional
if you can get past the sort of gamer II
Razer logo and green accents and the
battery life is solid if not exceptional
on the minus side as you heard during
the game testing this thing can get
really loud and the housing can get
really hot hot enough near the key
components that I would not want to have
this laptop on my lap while gaming
unless I was freezing to death and it
was the only viable source of warmth of
course there's also the price which at
$2,000 puts it out of the range of many
consumers so as expected there's a lot
to be said for the price to performance
ratio that you can get when building a
desktop PC especially when you're
comparing it to a laptop for around say
a thousand to $1500 depending on where
you're doing some give-and-take one
could easily part on a system that would
be equal if not surpass the razor blade
in performance but you'd have to include
a monitor a mouse a keyboard and a
Windows license to be fair and you
definitely would not be able to take it
with you at least not without a lot of
hassle and I guess a very large carrying
case quick aside here don't ever put a
monitor in a checked bag while you're
flying it never ends well so if
portability is high on your priority
list I'd say about $600 is the premium
that you're paying for it here at least
compared to a desktop PC and having done
a fair amount of travel myself in the
past couple years I can totally see why
that's more than worth it for some
people that's all for this video though
