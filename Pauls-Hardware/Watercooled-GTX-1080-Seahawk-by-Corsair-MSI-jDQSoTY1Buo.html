sponsored by fractal design MSI and
g.skill what's up guys welcome back to
Computex 2016 coverage here from Taipei
Taiwan I'm at the Grand Hyatt at the
Corsair Suites
and of course they're actually has quite
a few things on display they have some
new RGB LED fans it's a new corsair
dominator platinum memory also a special
LED lighting they've got a new version
of the C 400 case now Kyle is going to
be handling coverage of some of that
stuff so how they recommend checking the
awesomesauce Network channel for
information they're what I have here is
pretty exciting though
I've got the MSI slash Corsair Seahawk
graphics card so basically what this is
is an MSI designed GT X 1080 graphics
card right now it's using the reference
PCB although I am told Corsair is still
considering perhaps going with a custom
PC the custom PCB design for this card
Corsair of course has designed the
cooling for this card so you have an
all-in-one system with 120 millimeter
radiator and a corsair fan on top of
that and then you've got this nice
smooth design and closed Seahawk shroud
that's going around the blower style fan
across there that's mainly to keep your
VRMs warm i'm not warm pool to keep your
bearings cooled off beyond that you have
a fairly typical arrangement when it
comes to gtx 1088 pin power to SLI
fingers of course standard i/o as far as
outputs for the actual video you do get
a very nice backplate on there though I
thought that was pretty nicely designed
MSI dragons right on there as well and I
thought it was tastefully done now if
you guys are interested and getting your
hands on this card well I would be -
because the GTX 1080 is known for
running a little bit hot so far
especially if you're going with the
reference or founders Edition card
adding liquid cooling is going to open
up the potential for the clock speeds
here unfortunately Corsair was not able
to tell me exactly what this card is
going to be running at that's
information is still being kept secret
but I'm going to imagine based on what
my friend George said this is going to
ship with one of the highest clock
speeds if not the highest clock speed
available on the market so again guys
this is the Corsair / MSI Seahawk GTX
1080
give this video a thumbs up if you
enjoyed it also one last final thank you
to my sponsors for this event fractal
design MSI and g.skill and I'll be back
with more coverage from Taipei
