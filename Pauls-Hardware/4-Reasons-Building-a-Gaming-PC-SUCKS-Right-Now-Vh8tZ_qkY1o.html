year for PC hardware the 1080 TI
launched AMD returned to relevance with
the rise and launch and then the
follow-up surprise launch of thread
Ripper Intel refresh their enthusiasts
lineup with sky like X and then they
followed up by giving six core CPUs to
the mainstream with coffee lake a via
even the Radeon Vega 56 and 64 although
late to the party and not quite as
powerful as expected can still be added
to the list of options PC gamers have to
choose from so with all of this having
happened and considering that most of
the products expected the launch this
year have already launched you'd think
that it would be prime time to build a
gaming PC right now but it's not in fact
it kind of sucks
here are four reasons why item number 1
the obvious culprit GPU prices this is
the result of cryptocurrency mining and
it has been a pain in the backside of
anyone looking to buy a reasonably
priced mid-range graphics card since
about mid summer 2017 the rise of
alternative crypto currencies such as
aetherium that are resistant to ASIC
based mining has brought GPU mining back
into popularity with cards based on
AMD's Polaris architecture like the rx
480 and 580 in particular demand due to
their efficiency and flexibility and
videos cards suffered price jumps as
well but thankfully they've settled down
a bit which you can't say for any of
AMD's cards that are priced above $100
even though the gtx 1060 3 and 6 gig do
give gamers looking for a GPU in the 200
to 250 dollar range and option there's
not much competition for these cards
thanks to AMD's high prices so the
prices for Nvidia are generally still
the same or higher than when the GTX
1060 launched over a year ago 200 or
more for the 3 gig and 250 or more for
the 6 gig next up have you seen memory
prices lately
if budget builders weren't set back
enough by the GPU situation consider
that the average price for a simple 16
gigabyte 4x4 gig ddr4 2400 memory kit
has more than doubled in price since
early 2016 according to PC part picker
going from less than $90 to over 180 and
while that's one of the more extreme
examples 50 to 100% price increases over
the past year is pretty much the norm
for ddr4 and ddr3 memory we were warned
this of course market trends and all
there are explanations like the fabs are
switching over to a smaller
manufacturing process or defect rates
are high or they encountered setbacks
related to sampling and healed so the
supply situation remains tight or Apple
just bought it all like like all the
memory Apple just bought it or maybe
they just wanted to squeeze the supply
to up the price in order to earn record
profits for themselves this year but I
don't know where we'd find any evidence
of that now third up you may have
spotted Intel's recent coffee leak CPU
launch and you might have been excited
because clearly here is some evidence of
AMD's new competition from Rison paying
out mainstream six core Intel CPUs and
an unlocked quad core i3
not bad from Team blue but right now
there are some definite limitations to
this platform and motherboard selection
is chief among them there are only Z 370
motherboards available for this platform
until 2018 there are some budget Z 370
options in 120 140 dollar range but
that's still pretty expensive
considering that AMD has competitive be
350 motherboards for their rise in CPUs
for 70 and 80 dollars each that can even
do some overclocking speaking of budget
AZ 370 motherboard with a chipset that
costs more in order to unlock
overclocking for unlocked chips makes a
bit less sense with their new locked
CPUs like an i3 8100 our i-5 8400 but Z
370 is your only choice for a
motherboard right now I'm hoping Intel
considers a lower priced chipset that
still has some overclocking options
unlocked maybe call it Z 350 now lastly
if I had to choose the most impactful PC
technology that's become widely
available in the past 10 years or so I
would have to go with SSDs but my second
choice would be variable refresh rate
monitors don't worry it was a vertex -
at least when it comes to PC gaming but
I wish widely available could also align
with widely affordable when it comes to
these fancy new gaming monitors the
experience of playing on a variable
refresh rate monitor which synchronizes
the framerate output of your graphics
card with the refresh rate of your
monitor for buttery smooth gameplay that
also makes the most out of your graphics
cards performance is one that once
you've tried you just won't want to go
without especially if you play fast
paced PC games but monitors with this
feature that
compatible with nvidia gpus dubbed
g-sync are typically 100 to $200 or more
more expensive than a free sync monitor
with the same specs that's compatible
with AMD GPUs so that's fine just go
with an AMD GPU for their consumer
friendly free sync monitors that aren't
horribly marked up and pair it with an
AMD graphics card that is horribly
marked up so pick your poison over pay
for your AMD GPU and a fairly priced
free sync monitor or get a fairly priced
NVIDIA GPU and overpay for your G sync
monitor the choice is yours so guys I
know this was a negative video but it
just sort of occurred to me the other
day that things aren't all sunshine and
daisies in PC building land but
nevertheless we soldier on and I know
I'm going to keep building computers and
I'm pretty sure you guys are going to do
the same but there is something to be
said for waiting until 2018 to invest if
you're considering it maybe for now just
go with AMD CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs and and
you'll be fine
if you are looking for ideas for parting
out a PC without suffering from one of
these previously mentioned pitfalls
