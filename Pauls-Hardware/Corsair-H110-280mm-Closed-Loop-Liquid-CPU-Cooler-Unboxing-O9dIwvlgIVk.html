hardware today I'm going to be doing an
unboxing and overview of this 280
millimeter closed-loop liquid CPU cooler
from Corsair this is the H 110 serif
with a closer look at the retail box of
course this is part of the hydro series
from Corsair popular models from there
includes the H 100 as well as the H 80
this one is unique because it's their
first 2 by 140 millimeter fan version
that features the radiator a couple
hundred and 40 millimeter fans the pump
and block unit as well as the tubing to
connect them together it's made for both
Intel or AMD processors socket
compatibility for Intel is LGA 1155 1156
1366 and 2011 for ambi you have a and 2
a.m. 3 and FM one and that of course
would also include a 3 plus and FM 2
they also listing of processors there in
case you're not sure which processors go
with those sockets I also have features
over here on this side hundred and forty
millimeter fan designed for spirit
cooling performance and low noise next
gen low evaporation easy vent tubing
that's cold plate manifold design and
the mounting bracket of course for quick
and easy installation take a look inside
the box we have some documentation of
course so you have the corsair h 110
guide which will show you what parts are
included as well as basic installation
very similar installation to the
original h 100 of course pretty much the
same mounting solution is that i also
get a warranty from corsair that is a
two-year warranty of course to 140
millimeter fans included from corsair
accessories include the two mounting
back plates one for intel one for AMD
until is the square one
you also have of course the
corresponding rings which will hold the
pump / block in place you have a little
catch ring that you snap on and that
holds it in place which is very handy
you also have screws for mounting the
hundred forty millimeter fans you get
your mounting hardware for the actual h
110 itself with some old plastic bits
that snap into place as well as some
pads to secure your backplate to the
back of your motherboard and then you
have the bolts themselves one that set
work for all the AMD and Intel sockets
except for 2011 and then the other set
of course is for 2011 finally we have
the H 110 itself and of course this
includes docking at this end the pump /
block and at the bottom you can see
there's some pre applied thermal paste
I'm going to be doing some tests with
this and I'm going to be removing that
reapply thermal paste and attaching my
own the tubing is rubber and as you can
see it is adjustable so this can be
moved around depending on where you're
going to attach the radiator and where
you need to wrap the tubes and from the
tubes of course you have attachment to
the radiator with a small reservoir and
then you have the radiator itself which
is 280 by 140 and this is going to give
you improved performance because you
have improved surface area well you have
more surface area you have more fins in
there the fins are made of aluminum by
the way and then with the added surface
space you can get more thermal
dissipation and basically that would
allow you your CPU to run cooler that
will light do things like overclock
which is lots of fun the other benefit
you get from this is that larger 140
millimeter fans will allow you to
basically run them at a lower rpm or
often these 140 millimeter fans will
make less noise so it kind of gives you
a nicer balance there the one drawback
of course is that you don't have quite
as many cases that are compatible with
280 millimeter radiators these days this
is a fairly new unit and therefore you
might not you might have to search
around a little bit to find a compatible
case but check the message words check
the youtubes of course there's lots of
people out there who tried this in many
different cases and even some cases that
have smaller 240 millimeter radiator
mounting points you can still sort of
hack your way through where you can
drill some extra holes something along
those lines and that is gonna wrap it up
for this video guys once again this has
been my unboxing and overview of the
corsair h 110 280 millimeter closed loop
liquid cpu cooler if you guys are
wondering why i'm bringing you this
video right now since you probably have
seen a few closed-loop CPU coolers on my
channel already well I recently did a CH
220 this is from Swift tech and I said
in that one I was going to do a
comparison but there
take water 2.0 extreme butts people
suggested that I should throw in a
corsair model as well and I thought this
one was appropriate so yes I will be
bringing another future video I need to
still need to do all the work and
testing and stuff but that's coming soon
so I'll be comparing the H 110 the Swift
Tec H 220 as well as the thermal take
water 2.0 extreme so stay tuned for that
but thanks for watching this video if
you enjoyed it send me a like of course
subscribe to the channel if you want to
see more and we'll see you next time on
Paul's hard work</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
