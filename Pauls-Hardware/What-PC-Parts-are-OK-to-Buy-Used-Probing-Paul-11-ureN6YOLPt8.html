Pauls hardware this is probing Paul
episode number 11 and yeah I've been
doing this for a while now it's my
monthly Q&amp;amp;A video where I answer
questions that you guys ask so all the
questions from this month are being
derived from last month's probing polyps
toe number ten and look look how far
back through time we can look through
this portal that the original one is
getting so tiny notes it's almost
difficult to even see let's get into it
with question number one though from
striker X 1360 hey Paul again I 546 90
km z 97 with ddr3 I'm bottle Dyke in the
hell out of my 1080 I was wondering is
saving for an i7 7700 K would be wise he
does video editing I believe the
increased performance of the i5 variant
would benefit me which is a good
question but I will say look look at the
4690k now this is Devil's Canyon this
was Haswell refresh still selling for
240 bucks on new egg
not a very good deal when you compare it
to say you know a 6600 K at 7600 K
that's available now but obviously it
still has some chops this is a too
outdated of a processor now in the rest
of your posts because there was a little
bit of a cherry going on below we also
found out that he's running 35 40 34 40
by 1440 so ultra wide with the high
resolution and that also he's not
overclocking although he does have a
liquid cooling system in place now my
suggestion here would definitely be to
overclock this is only going to turbo
boost to 3.9 gigahertz and you should at
least be able to get 4.4 to 4.5
especially if you're using liquid
cooling and that should help your
performance however he also stated that
the games he was having difficulty with
with csgo on minecraft which really
aren't that difficult to run they can be
a little bit more CPU dependent than GPU
defended but my suggestion would be
maybe to look at other possible
contributing factors because this CPU
should be able to help if you overclock
it in particular it should be able to
keep up with that 1080 and I would wait
definitely to like really upgrade at
least until then and rise in CPUs come
out next month or in the next month or
two there should be some price updates
hopefully that happened after that job
so that should at least give you a bit
better selection so you are considering
upgrading but yeah overclock and maybe
check out your software situation see if
you have processes running in the
background look at your memory see if
that's somehow getting chewed up somehow
and that's contributing to the lower
frame rates because if you're running at
a higher resolution like 34 40 by 1440
at least in games that are more GPU
dependent the CPU should not be the
bottleneck if you're running really low
resolutions and the GPU is churning out
a bunch of frames that's when the CPU
can start to get bogged down a little
bit so thank you for the question and
let's jump to question number 2 which is
okay
murky conduct which is I like your name
so tape all I the laptop that has
Windows 10 on it is it possible to
transfer it to a PC build I was
originally just going to say no it's not
Joel Reynolds also here replied and said
yes if it's an OEM and he says he had to
contact Microsoft and really push them
because he got a replacement key with a
pro key and he's able to talk them into
it but let me just state this for the
record my contacting Microsoft can be
very hit or miss in particular if you're
using an OEM key and laptops have om
keys that's generally speaking how they
work but let me give a bit of more of an
explanation of kind of how Windows did
things with Windows 10 is that if you
buy Windows 10 directly from Microsoft
and you get a key and then you punch it
in to your newly installed computer the
key is actually used it's burnt or
whatever and then you get a digital
entitlement that ties itself to your
hardware and from what I understand the
motherboard and actually it can do some
specific writing into the UEFI there the
cool thing about this is if you activate
Windows unlike an old system or like a
system with the motherboard and then
take that motherboard and put it like
you know reconfigure the system or
something and do a fresh install of
Windows on it windows should just
activate the windows database should
recognize the digital entitlement tied
to that hardware and just activate the
software that's happened to me two or
three times so far with your particular
situation you have a laptop so it's
going to know am key and chances are
you're not going to be able to change
that or move that around at all Windows
is much more restricted when it comes to
giving people service when it comes to
OEM T's that they say talk to the
manufacturer of your device instead ever
since window did the anniversary update
I don't know when that was a few months
back you can actually take your
Microsoft account
with your Windows 10 digital license and
you can tie your windows 10 digital
license to the Microsoft account this
would actually allow you to have for
example like multiple computers with the
unique login for your Microsoft account
so you can move between different
machines there are some restrictions in
place that I want to dive too much into
the details right here but I will say I
prefer not having the Microsoft account
I prefer just a unique you know user
login just to the machine but if you
really have a Windows license especially
if you bought it retail and you need the
ability to switch between multiple
machines consider tying it to your
Microsoft account and that might make
activation especially if you do a
hardware update a little bit easier but
to give it too long didn't read answer
no you probably cannot take your OEM key
from a laptop and move it to a desktop
unless you're in a very interesting
situation much like Joel was here and
you managed to type talk Microsoft into
it but that's seriously up to them and I
really ever hear that actually happening
here's a question from luga why did you
leave new leg what made you have your
own channel this is a question I've
actually sort of addressed before in
probing Paul but I bring it back up very
specifically because alright I feel kind
of bad about this just a little bit but
I I wanted I wanted to do it so I'm just
going to do it anyway even though I feel
kind of bad alright so I left new egg
for a variety of reasons one of the big
reasons was that I tried to work with
management to sort of coordinate things
because when you're doing a creative job
like creating videos even if you're just
talking about PC hardware that kind of
thing you need to kind of you need to
keep a little bit of a fire going and if
you feel like your voice isn't being
heard when you're saying I think we
should do things this way or whatever it
just tends to sort of suck that out of
you so that over time plus sort of what
I might've was not mean my voice is not
being heard by the people who are
actually running things and making
decisions led me to decide you know what
I think I'm just going to kind of go in
on my own when I left doing is about
like 80 to 85 thousand subscribers and
the stupid thing is that the people who
I had disagreements with they aren't
even there anymore like they so they
went in and did whatever they did and
now
not there anymore but I didn't want to
point this up first off new egg has a
new crew that's working there actually
met them at CES and they were very nice
people
so if you guys do want to check their
stuff out I think they have improved it
in the past few months things seem to be
turning around they seem to be more
Hardware Hardware focused and that kind
of thing but again my bit of
schadenfreude I here to use a word that
I'm my old Newegg co-worker Rachel
really like to use is that I have
finally passed them in subscribers I'm
at 456 now and I didn't really like
tweet about that or anything but it's
two years in two years and four months
or so this is my announcement video that
I had separated from new AG which was
September 21st 2014 so two two years and
three or four months and that comes so
far so I'm happy with the decision and
again I bear no ill will towards new
eggs of course there were some people
who aren't there anymore who I wasn't
super happy with but we'll leave it at
that and hopefully that gives you guys a
bit more of an explanation of what went
down there anyway next question is from
McLaren's Carr of week reviews right
here I'm currently using a Hauppauge HD
PVR 60 that's as close as I can get to
pronouncing this hauppage it is a Native
American word a Native American Indian
to be specific HD PVR 60 I would like to
step up to something with a higher
bitrate I have built a PC to handle
aside from Elgato and if your media
options with 60 K bit rates which would
include like the elgato hd60 what would
you recommend for video capture swimming
no limit in file size I almost kind of
felt bad bringing this question up and
answering it because I don't really have
a very good answer to it to be perfectly
honest I have a bit of research I've
done I'll point you towards a couple
brands the first brand is made well and
they they're more sort of towards the
prosumer getting into the much more
expensive professional market so the
capture cards tend to cost a lot but
although I have not worked with them
directly
I have heard very positive things about
them recently
although the website needs to they need
to change their website a little bit
because they obviously have a code issue
throwing there at the top anyway but
yeah major well parts can be expensive
you know starting around 300 bucks going
up to the you know 500 two thousand
dollar range but again I've heard good
things
out them beyond that I would check out
black magic again people have hit and
miss stuff with them my most recent
capture card purchase is this black
magic deck link mini recorder 4k
internal PCIe card and I did some
testing initial stuff with it about a
month and a half ago and I haven't
touched it since purely for lack of time
so again I wish had a better answer for
you for that but some yeah at least
black magic and major well I would say
check those out next is a motif I'm a
I'm a tow sing I'm sorry if I'm
pronouncing your name wrong
dual sixteen by nine or single 21 bind
what's a sixteen by nine on top
definitely single 21 by nine with the
sixteen by nine on top if you're going
to gain your frog in a game on one
screen having a twenty one by nine
screen I think is a very ideal gaming
situation and yeah I mean you're
basically giving yourself more screen
real estate by twenty one by nine and a
better gaming experience and you can put
that sixty mi9 up on top or you could
flip it a vertical and put it off to the
side which is a great way to look at web
pages and that kind of thing as well
Jonathan Heiner asked a very good
question well he actually corrected me
first from last month's video give a
bite not gigabit which was definitely my
mistake when you're talking about bits
versus bytes and how they are calculated
and how they are actually shown when
you're advertised products there is
confusion there but anyway more to his
point
thanks for the SSP discussion I'm still
weighing options for a future upgrade
and I'm slowly becoming less interested
in MDOT to nvme as the prices are simply
too high / gigabit give give big bite I
feel most consumers don't need the added
performance my thoughts I would
completely agree with you Jonathan
largely because those and nvm iam that
two jacks are still so freakin expensive
it's cool to look at like a little
chewing gum stick you know roughly sized
SSD and think like wow that by itself
has the same performance as like a two
or three or four even like six drive
raid array with standard SSD like
standard SATA SSDs some impressive
performance but if you're not going to
use it it's definitely not worth it you
really need to have something that you
do with that SSD to make it like worth
the money that you invest in it so I
might
uses video editing because that's
something where you need a ton of
storage readily available that can
quickly pull off with your permanent
storage and drop into the memory or
whatever now there are some SSDs that
are nvme and m2 that are coming down in
price of bits the SSD 600 P series from
Intel is definitely one of those however
this one has pretty significantly
reduced performance when you compare it
to the the much faster ones like the
sequester right here 560 megabits
megabytes per second reads are pretty
fast 1775 but again not quite up there
with like the Samsung 960 s and that
kind of thing however I mean you can
still get this and it will be faster
than a typical SATA Drive but yeah for
your money getting a few SATA drives and
rating them together could be an option
although then you deal with the
possibility of drive failure but yes
we're now we got to kind of keep
watching those nvme drives they're still
kind of a premium product and they cost
a lot of money but hopefully the pricing
will come down soon
federico trenton what do you think about
used hardware what components are fine
even when pre-owned and what to avoid
buying used and I believe this is the
last question yes it is all right so it
doesn't that is a good question I might
do a separate video on this as well but
let me run down the parts first off and
I'll say what I think is good and what
is not okay first off CPU CPUs are good
good part to buy used as long as they're
confirmed to work because CPUs very
rarely fail and they typically don't
suffer from performance degradation if
you can ask if the CPU you're buying
used has been overclocked and
particularly if it's been run at a high
voltage for a while that would be the
one caveat where I would say don't buy
it if it's been like overclock for the
past three years running it 1.5 volts or
something like that CPU cooler yeah you
can you can buy those used I think just
make sure you know they're cleaned off
and everything that doesn't apply to
liquid coolers though I wouldn't do that
the pump will fail eventually
motherboards next that's hit or miss you
can't have individual parts of a
motherboard that fails so that would be
a warning sign like if you buy use
motherboard and they set it up and it
works and I go everything's fine then
you go to connect your network and like
the NIC is dead or something like that
that would suck so I've kind of 50/50 on
buying used motherboards memory is
usually okay again
it's confirmed work memory does go bad
eventually over time but typically if
it's working it's working and will last
for a very long period of time storage I
would say no hard drives and SSDs you
typically don't know how much they've
been used and again they will die
eventually so unless you can get like a
snapshot of the smart readout from the
drive so you can know exactly I company
how many bytes have been written to it
and that kind of thing
typically I would not recommend buying
storage secondhand a graphics card I
would say it's probably okay again as
long as it's cleaned and not like
completely caked with dust and that kind
of thing case is probably okay again as
long as it's been cleaned out cases have
a very long lifespan power supply as
well as long as it's a decent power
supply if it's 80 plus rated and it's
from a reputable manufacturer they
should have a very long lifespan and
again philosoph cleaned and not caked
with dust and hasn't been used by a
smoker that kind of thing and I think
that's just about all the parts beyond
that I guess monitors monitors again are
hit or miss if they're very old the
backlight can start to go out on them
and get dimmer and the colors can not be
as vibrant so again I'm kind of 50/50 on
that and then peripherals like keyboards
and mice I would say probably not
because they tend to get a lot of use
and get gunky and worn out and stuff so
that's a nice thing to get new and plus
you know you you interact with them so
there's a lot more debris and detritus
that might kind of get get up in there
so yeah peripherals I'd say you know buy
those new if you have the option not
going to do it for this month's episode
of probing Paul guys I hope you've
enjoyed it leave me thumbs up if you did
have because I love your feedback and
every time people have thumbs up it
makes me smile and I get a warm fuzzy
feeling inside also of course if you
have questions for me for next month
leave them in the comment section down
below
I will be browsing through those
probably today and then also probably
again when I set it for next month's
probing Paul thanks again for watching
and we'll see an extent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
