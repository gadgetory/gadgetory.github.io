it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more hey guys how's it
going - welcome back to Pauls hardware
today's video is about setting up
FreeNAS in a Riptide Riptide is my a
massive $10,000 plus build with a 16
core thread Ripper based system in the
top with 210 ATT eyes and in the bottom
there's a little free Ness system and as
I have gone through this build process
many many people have asked me for a
tutorial or a walkthrough and I want to
be clear right from the get-go here this
is not necessarily going to be a
tutorial it's gonna be a walkthrough of
my setup procedure I've only really
installed FreeNAS a couple times so I'm
not necessarily an expert I will point
you guys towards the resources I am
using to set it up myself and I will
screen cap this process though so you
guys can get a better idea of what's
going on as I go through the
installation but hardware is documented
in my earlier Riptide video so check
that out if you want to see what's
exactly installed I have been intending
to upgrade the memory that's installed
there to ECC memory though so I have 16
gigs of ECC memory here from crucial
it's not necessary to have ECC memory
for FreeNAS but it's recommended if
you're very concerned about data
integrity and it's recommended to have
about 1 gig of memory per one terabyte
of storage so 32 terabytes of storage
via the four hard drives that are in
there and then 32 gigabytes of memory
via the 216 gig sticks here however
although ECC memory is compatible with
risin and risin two processors on this
platform if the motherboard manufacturer
enables it in the BIOS for whatever
motherboard you're using ECC memory does
not currently work for any of the AMD
APU which is what I specifically chose
so that I would have enough
expandability of either expansion slot
that I didn't need a graphics card long
story short I can't use this memory with
this configuration at least not yet
we're hoping that when we rise in Pro ap
use launch which is supposed to happen
in the next couple months I think we
might see ECC support for these ap use
but for the time being I'm gonna have to
put those aside and switch
to a non-ecc memory kit so of Corsair
Dominator platinum kit right here 32
gigs I know this is risin compatible to
ddr4 3000 speed which is perfectly fast
someone install this so we can move on
with our installation of freedom
the first things first upon booting up I
want to double check the bios and make
sure that we got all our hardware
recognized I did test this stuff
beforehand but it's now installed so I
did go for the memory and I plugged in
the do CP standard profile to give us
ddr4 3000 and then I went over to
advanced and looked at our SATA
configuration to double-check and make
sure all four of the WD eight terabyte
drives are being recognized there then I
forgot were to boots and check out our
hard drive priorities we can see we've
got the force MP 500 we've got our Intel
opt-in drive and we've got our 4wd drive
so all of our tribes that are connected
are recognized
so now that I'm reasonably confident
that the hardware is functioning
properly and everything's plugged in and
recognized let's switch over to actually
getting FreeNAS installed so I'm gonna
need to create a USB FreeNAS installer
if you guys have gone through Windows 10
installation it's the same general idea
so the first step is gonna be to go and
download Rufus which is a piece of
software that can create bootable USB
drives and we're gonna use Rufus and the
FreeNAS ISO to create a FreeNAS
installation USB on this little Corsair
a cake flash drive that I have I might
as well go ahead and plug this in make
sure there's nothing important on it
because it's gonna be completely wiped
I'll put links to these download pages
in the description but Rufus 3.1 is the
version that we downloaded now and then
over on the freenas site they have
storage only configuration and storage
plugins and virtual virtualization I
want to mess around with some plugins
including Plex for examples so I did
download that version 11 point 2 beta 2
Rufus doesn't need to install you can
just run the exe that was downloaded it
is automatically selected the only USB
drive that I've installed and it wants
us to select the ISO so let's go back
over to downloads and choose the FreeNAS
11.2 beta that we just downloaded and
then we'll go ahead and click start it's
gonna give us a warning that all the
data is gonna be deleted and then we'll
give it a minute while it writes that
data to the USB and then we can use the
USB to install FreeNAS so pop that USB
into the USB port on the back of the
FreeNAS motherboard and turn the system
back on I would usually hit delete to go
back into the UEFI BIOS and change the
boot order to boot off of that USB Drive
but fortunately since there's no other
bootable devices on this system
it automatically went and did default
into the installation mode and now
throttling interrupts so our
installation has gone through
successfully although what I'm screen
capping for you guys is just a mess
because of this interrupt storm detected
thing that we're getting it's probably
something to do with some of the USB
ports on this motherboard that I might
be able to disable in the BIOS I'm
looking up some information I'm
hopefully trying to fix that but the
underlying installation does appear to
have gone through successfully so that
was some interesting initial
troubleshooting the interrupt storm
detected on irq two six five issue has
been solved now though I initially tried
to solve it by going in and disabling
USB devices and a couple other things in
the UEFI because it seemed to be a
device on the motherboard that was
throwing a repeating error that the
operating system was picking up and just
displaying on screen over and over again
which made it particularly difficult to
navigate the command-line interface that
FreeNAS often uses ultimately though I
had to double-check what version of the
BIOS we were using on this motherboard
and we actually had a pretty old version
I think it was version 0 400 something
and recently there's an update about two
weeks ago to a 901 so we downloaded that
put it on a USB updated the BIOS and now
we have a nice clear look at everything
because we're no longer getting that
error thrown constantly so that's good
actually
next step is Internet I have no internet
here so let me get back
so ultimately I decided to go back and
do a fresh clean reinstallation of
FreeNAS just so I can show you guys what
it looks like without all those error
messages popping up all over the place
so I went back into the UEFI and ASUS
motherboards have a boot override option
you can do so I just choose UEFI boot
off of my USB Drive with the FreeNAS
installer on it after that loaded up I
chose option 1 to boot off Sabrina's
installer then option 1 again to do an
installation or an upgrade and then I
went and chose from the list of drives
that are connected my Intel obtained 32
gigabyte SSD to install 2 it shows the
fresh install option and then to do a
full format on the boot device and then
I confirms that all the data on this
device will be deleted all the data and
all these drives is going to end up
being deleted today but after that it'll
prompt you to create a root password
which you definitely should do keep a
password on this and then I chose the
UEFI boot mode rather than the legacy
BIOS after that short wait for the
installation to proceed you'll see
on-screen console text pop up and scroll
by and then after a bit you'll be
prompted to reboot and it will tell you
to remove the installation media cuz you
don't want it to reboot and then boot up
of your Installer again you want it to
boot off of the disk you just installed
- this time after the reboot there'll be
a lot more on-screen console text going
by as files are copied hardware is being
detected and you will get a message to
say this will take a long time so I was
prepared for a long way but it actually
only took a couple minutes but after
installation is complete you'll be
presented with a simple command-line
interface there's 11 options available
there which you should maybe take a look
at there's useful stuff available like
shutting the system down resetting the
boot password for example but you'll
also see a web user interface with an IP
address listed so you want to copy down
that IP address and then move over to a
different computer that's also connected
to the same network because now we can
pretty much go headless with our
freeness and not even have a monitor
connected to it and we can control it
and set it up via a different computer
over the network via the web interface
so all you want to do is go to a browser
and type in that IP address 192.168.1.1
- actually setting up the NASS itself
and configuring the drive so in order to
set up my 4 8 terabyte hard drives into
a massive 32 terabyte data repository I
need to start by creating a pool
for this just navigate over to storage
and then fools and then click Add or
create here you can choose the drives
from the available disks section and add
hard drives to the pool by either
clicking the right arrow on them to add
them to the data v-dubs list or you can
just click the suggest layout button and
that will sort of take a look at the
drives that you have and give a
recommendation for what it recommends
based on the hardware that's available
it shows all four of my 8 terabyte hard
drives and recommended raid Z 2 which I
went with because that's what I probably
would have chosen to use anyway FreeNAS
calls this layout and you can kind of
equate it to a raid setup if you've ever
set up a raid array before in fact they
pretty much have the same names to
mirror requires at least two disks and
puts the same data on both disks one can
fail without losing data rate z one
requires at least three disks and one
disk can still fail you get a little bit
more storage capacity that way and raid
Z 2 requires at least 4 disks but two of
them can fail so you lose some storage
capacity but you gain redundancy and
since data integrity and long-term
storage is a goal here raid Z - it is if
you guys watched any of the build videos
on the FreeNAS system you know that I
have two SSDs in there the up tain drive
is what the FreeNAS operating system is
installed on right now but I have a
second SSD in there 120 gig Corsair MP
500 that I wanted to use as a cache
there's actually two different types of
cache with free nests there is Zil and
there is l2 art there's a lot of depth
of both of these I'm going to give a
very simple explanation as to why I'm
choosing what I'm choosing but Zil is
ZFS intent log and it can help with
write speeds but probably not for a home
setup that's more for people who are
integrating these into servers and
enterprise environments also they're
recommending a battery backup SSD for a
Zil cache and that is simply because if
that drive were to fail you would
actually lose data on your freenas setup
so I don't want that and I don't have a
battery backed up SSD so I'm not doing
the xilk at l2 arc is a read cache this
can help with read speeds but again only
in certain situations it's also going to
eat up some of your system ram so you
should only really bother looking in to
set up setting up an l2 art cache if
you're already maxed out on system ram
which I am so since I have the hardware
I am going to go for that and use the
hundred twenty gig course air force MP
500 as my l2 our cache and hopefully I'm
going to report back and do a follow up
video on some of the performance and
stuff with this and FreeNAS does have a
built-in monitoring tool that you can
use to see if you're actually getting
any benefit out of that so hopefully for
home use I'll be able to come back and
tell you guys if that was actually even
worth it so now that I've set up my pool
I can see it here in the dashboard but
in order to use that pool the setting up
the pool is kind of like creating a raid
array we now need to create datasets on
that pool and that's kind of like
creating partitions on a raid array to
some degree so so we're gonna go back
over to storage here we're gonna choose
pools we're gonna select our big 32
terabyte pool at least or whatever you
named your ISM we're gonna click add
datasets here there are various options
you can go through as well as an
advanced mode where you can tell it like
how much data it X should actually use
but I'm not gonna bother with any of
that I'm going to go to basic mode I'm
going to have it inherit most of the
stuff that I setup from the data pool
but I'm gonna name this media and one of
the things you can do with data sets is
create different ones with different
rules and different levels of access and
the ability to have it backed up as well
with a snapshot since media is like TV
shows and movies and music and stuff
that is theoretically replaceable I
don't want it backed up it's but it's
also probably gonna be a lot of space so
I'm just gonna go to the share type
switch that to Windows and click save
and now under our big 32 terabyte pool
we have a data set called media it is
there and we are almost ready to
actually access it and start saving
stuff to it in order to do that though
we need to go over to sharing and since
we're using Windows based machines here
at my home we're gonna choose a Windows
SMB share we're gonna add one up here
we're going to direct it to the path we
want to direct it to direct it to our
media data set here go ahead and name it
media and we're gonna allow guest access
what you probably want to do for
security is create users and give them
individual access but for now a guest
access will be just fine we can also had
a periodic snapshot task but we're not
going to do that right now we're just
gonna hit save
so to recap all your drives go into a
pool data sets get created on that pool
to separate your different data out and
then you create a share in order to
share that on the network at this point
if you've done everything correctly you
should be able to go over to your
network on a network attached computer
you should see your FreeNAS there and
then your share that you just created
should be available for you to go ahead
and start using so I'm not going to go
back and create one more data set and
this one's going to be specifically for
records basically I want the data in
that data set to be backed up important
stuff you know if you have
tax info or whatever else you want to
save so first I will create the new data
set and I'm just going to call it
records so there it is and I can create
instantaneous snapshots just a one-time
backup if you want but I actually want
this to do this automatically so I'm
gonna go up to tasks and periodic
snapshot tasks I'll go ahead and create
a new one so here we're going to choose
the records data set that we just chose
we can tell it how long to keep the
snapshot we can tell it when to begin
and end the task which I probably want
to have it do in the middle of the night
you know will say like 2:30 in the
morning sure that sounds good and we can
let it run for an hour and then the
interval I'm just gonna have it do it
once a day and right now it's got Monday
through Friday but let's have it through
the weekends too so go ahead and save
that
it's enabled and now this task should
run every day at the set time and then
it'll save the snapshots into a
directory on the FreeNAS now that I've
created a share for it I can go and see
that on the network and then from here
you can actually go to properties and
previous versions there's none right now
because it's not 2:30 in the morning so
it hasn't run yet but you'll be able to
see previous versions here and then you
would be able to recover that and the
cool thing is the snapshots that are
created are read-only so even if you get
hit with like a cryptolocker virus or
something like that you should still be
able to recover your most important
stuff from those snapshots if you really
need to now guys I was additionally
planning to make this video a bit longer
and a bit more in depth but some stuff
has come up this week that is exciting
but also has caused me to lose a lot of
time so the upshot is I have some really
cool videos coming up very soon that I
think you guys will be interested in but
this initial setup video for the freenas
I've had to limit to really just kind of
the basic steps to get things up and
running to actually access it on my
network I do have another freenas video
that I made for my old set up so if you
guys want to check that out I have a few
more details that I go into there of
course it is the older version so the UI
is different but essentially it's the
same type of functionality if you
enjoyed this video though hit the thumbs
up button and of course subscribe for
more tech videos coming at you very soon
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
