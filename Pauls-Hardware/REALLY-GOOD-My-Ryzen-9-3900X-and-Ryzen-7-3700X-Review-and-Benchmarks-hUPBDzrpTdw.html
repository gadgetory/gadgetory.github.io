review video for these new long-awaited
Rison 3000 series CPUs I have the 8 core
16 thread risin 7 330 700 X and the 12
core 24 thread risin 9 3900 X here today
have a whole bunch of benchmarks to
share with you guys
speaking of benchmarks though my mind is
pretty much mush from running so many
for this past week so I really hope you
guys find them useful and although we
all have been waiting for this launch
for what seems like forever now I do
have one request for AMD please never do
a major cpu launch and a major GPU
launch on the same day ever again even
if it's 7-7 and that that is so clever
and perfect because they're both built
on the 7-9 of your process I need sleep
and yes I will have a Radeon rx 50 750
700 XT review up in a few hours as well
so subscribe to my channel if you're not
already cooler masters SF series fans
feature addressable RGB LEDs and a
square design to maximize fan mount
coverage and generate high pressure air
flow available in standard hundred
twenty millimeter size as the SF 120 P
as well as the dual fan 240 millimeter
option in the SF 240p a RGB cooler
master has integrated multiple layers of
noise reduction technology and an
optimized family design into this series
so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more Rison 3000
series CPUs they are socket am for
they're based on seven nanometers into
architecture those are the important
points for today I'm not going to rehash
any of the gritty details because we've
been discussing these for months to be
honest instead I'm gonna be getting
right to the benchmarks starting with
the setup I configured to test beds 1
for AMD and one for Intel and I tried to
keep minimal variance between the two
setups both rigs are open test beds and
run the same memory CPU cooler and
graphics card the memory is a 16 gig 2
by 8 gig kit of g-scale tridents a royal
RGB running at 3600 megahertz in casa
latency 16 CPU cooler is the new Noctua
Nhu 12 a tower cooler which is on the
expensive side for an air cooler but it
allowed me to test the temperatures
between each CPU and the graphics card
is the asus rog Strix r-tx 2080 ti
running with the out of the box
manufacturer overclock the AMD testbed
was based on the gigabyte x5 70 horas
master motherboard running UEFI version
f-5e which includes AMD jeesus cpu
microcode version 1.0.0 3 a be windows
10 version 1903
installed on a 512 gig Samsung 970 Pro
and that to nvme SSD and forego juice
we'd have a cooler master MWe 1200 watt
Platinum power supply the Intel testbed
is based on the asrock z3 90 Taichi
ultimate motherboard with the same
Noctua and a 212 eight-hour cooler that
same 16 gig kit of G scale royal 3600
speed memory and the Asus RT X xx atti
for storage there's another 512 gig sim
son 970 pro m2 nvme SSD and the power
supply is an EVGA supernova g3 750 watt
unit for comparison I have five CPUs
total Intel is represented by their two
most recent flagship parts the 8 core 16
thread core I nine ninety nine hundred K
and the six core 12 thread core i7 8700
K which cost four hundred ninety dollars
and three hundred and sixty dollars
respectively as of the time of filming
these are both based on intel's most
recent 14 nanometer cpu
microarchitectures
on the AMD side we of course have the
new 8 core 16 thread rise in 730 700 X
and the 12 core 24 thread rise in 9 3900
X and I'm also going to be including the
rise in 2000 series flagship the 8 core
16 thread rise in 7 2700 X which is
based on 12 nanometers n+ architecture
as opposed to the 7 nanometers and 2
architecture that the resin 3000 series
is based on and now some benchmarks I
want to start off by talking about
frequencies power draw and temperatures
because I think that's a big part of the
story here all the CPUs are running at
stocks beads with XMP enabled but no MCE
or multi-core enhancement or the
relative equivalent to that on the AMD
side all the CPUs can adjust their
frequency on the fly depending on load
and temperature so I wanted to show the
peak frequency that a core or two might
hit and the sustain frequency during a
night of 64 stability test the 9900 K
has a peak turbo of 5 gigahertz and the
8700 K goes up to 4.7 yoghurts under
load though the 9900 K hits 4.7
gigahertz across all cores and the 8700
K does 4.3 gigahertz of course all these
chips could be overclocked but I'm
sticking with stock settings for this
video meanwhile the 2700 X hits 4.3 5
gigahertz max and just under 4 gigahertz
sustained across all cores
well the 3700 X got just a bit higher to
4.37 5 gigahertz while also showing off
the best sustained all core frequencies
in my testing at four point three to
five gigahertz finally the 3900 X hit
over 4.5 gigahertz 4.5
five on a couple cores to be specific
but that dropped off pretty quickly down
to four point oh five gigahertz is
sustained during the stress test I also
measured temperatures during the burn in
both average and maximum as you can see
here these can be compared since I was
using the same cooler and all tests with
minimal variance in ambient temperature
the excellent Noctua and hu 12a did a
great job keeping these cool even the
9900 K which is still a Hot Chip even a
stock with a 101 degrees Celsius max
temperature and a more reasonable eighty
point five degrees Celsius on average
the 3900 X is only a degree cooler on
average but did not peak nearly as hot
which is impressive since it does have
50% more cores 12 versus 18 the 3700 X
though with more cores and a higher
sustained frequency than 8700 K
absolutely wins this test with a 71
point to see average temperature and it
never got above 80 power draws the other
side of the efficiency discussion and I
measured full system draw during a
blender CPU render test I was actually
blown away by this comparison just 161
watts on average for the 3700 X that is
50 watts less than the second gen 2700 X
and that's more than 80 watts less than
the 87 out of K and literally half the
power draw of the 99 hundred K they're
both a core 16 thread parts by the way
Wow AMD like wow the 12 core 3900 X
comes in with less draw than the 8700 K
or the 9900 K as well again 6 &amp;amp; 8 core
parts compared to a 12 core that's just
very very nice as well let's move into
our performance tests we're gonna start
with some CPU benchmarks and then we'll
do some gaming benchmarks starting with
Cinebench our 20 and here we can see the
3900 X dominating everyone else over
7000 I'm going to be using it as a point
of comparison from here on out the 3700
X and 9900 K both scored just shy of
4920 700 X coming in just over 4,000 and
3404 for the 8700 K the Cinebench single
thread test is where AMD has suffered in
the past and you can see that
represented by the 2700 X's score of 438
but the 3900 X and 3700 X both scored
over 500 in this test
while the 9900 K and 8700 K scored 485
and 479 respectively that is a small win
but a win nonetheless for the Rison 3000
series scoring about 3
or 5% respectively better than the 9900
K and 8700 K next to CPU mark a CPU
focused test that's part of the past
mark performance Suites here we have an
overall score of 30,000 actually over
30,000 for the 3900 X compare that to
the 90 900k score of just under 20,000
at more than 10,000 points higher
although it does scale with the core and
thread count of the two CPUs
the 3900 X is about 36% faster than the
9900 K and about 47% faster than the
8700 K moving over to the single thread
test and the 2,700 X again is
representing where we're coming from
here with a score of 20 to 85 meanwhile
the 3900 X and 3700 X is going much
closer to about 2900 here again the
single thread tests seem to be on par or
even a little bit better with the rise
in 3000 series but based on the rest of
my tests I think this is because these
are shorter tests and the rise in CPUs
are actually hitting higher frequencies
as my earlier tests already showed under
sustained load we're not going to be
hitting as quite as high frequencies
with the rise in CPUs and that we bore
now doesn't move into the game testing
but before that let's move on to blender
first is a fishy cat render and this is
just time in seconds so remember a lower
score is better here the 3900 X wins
once again with a 22-point one second
time the slowest was the 8700 K with
30.9 seconds still the 9900 K was about
9.5 percent slower 8700 K was about 40%
slower as compared to the 3900 X next up
is a BMW 27 render which takes quite a
bit longer the 3900 X here came in at
161 seconds which is very fast over 35%
faster than the 9900 K almost a hundred
percent faster than the 8700 K and 65
percent faster than the 2,700 X let's
look at some production performance next
we're using the Adobe Premiere Media
encoder to encode about a three-minute
4k h.264 video 40 megabits per second
and we're just showing comparative time
and seconds here once again so lower is
better 3900 X wins with 270 seconds 3700
X is about 4.5 percent slower 2700 X is
about 9.2 percent slower 9900 K and 8700
K about 15 and 25% slower I then took
that same 3-minute video brought it into
handbrake and took it from 4k down to
1080 or 1080 30 frames per second using
their fast free sets here we're listing
the time in seconds and also the
encoding speed in frames per second so
the time slower is better for encoding
speed the higher number is better we had
60 frames per second for the 3900 X that
was definitely the fastest about 18
percent faster than the 3700 X and about
21 percent faster than the 9900 K next
up is v-ray version 4.0 7 this is a ray
tracing software suite that runs at
tests and outputs a result in case
samples we can see the 3900 X just shy
of 20,000 with the score of 19,000 727
compare that to the 87 or K all the way
down there at ten thousand four hundred
twenty seven hundred X gets a bit better
to twelve thousand 205 3900 X was over
thirty percent faster than the 3700 X
and about 25 percent faster than the 99
hundred K here and our final CPU
benchmark is corona 1.3 this again is
measuring time in seconds so lower is
better 3900 X finished in 73 seconds
compare that to the 9900 K is 97 seconds
which is about 33% slower next up we
have a few game tests to try to suss out
some relative game performance first off
the 3d mark firestrike ultra synthetic
test this is a high resolution test
gives an overall score as well as
graphics and physics the graphics test
might give us an indication of relative
performance between these CPUs with the
same graphics card but honestly there
was less than 1% difference between all
of these scores so not too much to say
there the physics score gives us a bit
more of a story of the actual overall
performance of each CPU with the 3900 X
coming in with the score over 28,000
compared to the 9900 Ches just shy of
24,000 the 9900 K is about 16% slower
here and the 8700 K is about 35% slower
next up is 3d mark x pi this is a
DirectX 12 test again the overall scores
are fairly similar here graphics score
is once again also really similar only
about a percentage point difference
between them although the 9900 K and the
8700 K were just a little bit faster in
the graphics department CPU tests though
again is going to show us more of a raw
score about CPU performance and here the
3900 X wins once again with the score of
eleven thousand seven hundred ninety
nine hundred K did break 10000 got close
to eleven thousand but it was still
about 7.2 percent slower
and now a couple actual game tests
running at 1920 by 1080 and if history
is any indicator here the 9900 K should
be just a bit faster at a lower
resolution 1920 by 1080 then its Rison
counterparts and that was the case and
shadow of the Tomb Raider in direct x12
mode was the largest gap I saw when it
comes to the 9900 K beating the 3900 X
17.8% faster with a frame rate of 140
9.7 as compared to the 3900 X's 127
point 1 and then our final test here is
Grand Theft Auto 5 DirectX 11 still
running at 1920 by 1080 and here we see
a similar story once again when it comes
to gaming which is that the 9900 K does
still seem to have a little bit of an
edge with a hundred and sixty-four
average frames per second overall just
barely beating out the 3900 X with 158
frames per second that is about 3.8
percent faster for the 9900 K 8700 K was
not quite able to beat it though is
actually about 4% slower but again we
have to keep in mind that the 8700 K is
running at about 400 megahertz slower
than the 9900 K here I'm pretty
confident that if you took the 87 under
K we ramped up the clock speed to be
equivalent with the 9900 K we'd see the
same performance here as well so finally
here we have some overall slides just
mashing together all of the data I have
accumulated to give you some semblance
of I guess closure is what we're really
looking for here but I'm using the 3900
X as the 100% baseline and then showing
the relative performance of all the
other CPUs and here we can see the 3700
X just barely beats out the 9900 K with
about 17 to 18 percent less performance
overall than the 3900 X 2700 X meanwhile
comes in at 71.5%
8700 K takes up the rear was 65 0.7 as
for gaming performance I did not run a
ton of gaming tests so we're only really
looking at four tests combined together
here so bear that in mind but with the
3900 X as the 100% baseline the 8700 K
and 9900 K actually did demonstrate a
bit of increased gaming performance 99er
K in particular about 5.8 percent better
than the 3900 X although that's mainly
because of the shadow of the Tomb Raider
score meanwhile the 3700 X is just a
couple percentage points behind and the
2700 X is 7
cents lower finally here's a slide
comparing both of those performance
metrics with the price of each card so
360 for the 8700 K and 490 for the 9900
K I'm going with current prices for the
readily available CPUs that are already
out and then of course the launch prices
for the 3,700 X and 3900 X they've had
to sum up this slide I would say that
the gaming numbers all look very very
similar - the 2700 X well the compute
performance scores show a clear lead for
AMD so conclusions now I am impressed
AMD has absolutely hyped up products in
the past that have fallen flat but I'm
very happy to say that that is not the
case with the rise in 3000 series at
least not these two CPUs that I have
here Intel's argument since first gen
rise and launched has always been about
their single core performance and there
definitely is still a little bit of an
edge for Team Blue there especially when
it comes to gaming but it has shrunk
down so much that it is instantly offset
by everything else the raw compute
performance the value you get when it
comes to the core and thread count
compared to Intel and the stunning
increases in power efficiency that Intel
just does not have an answer for right
now combine that with a platform that
has come into its own with a wide array
of full-featured motherboards available
and the previously unmentioned in this
video upgrade to PCI Express Gen 4 this
time around which I just kind of left
this little bonus cherry on the cake and
well I see this is an absolute win for
AMD I don't know how else to put it I
really hope you guys have enjoyed this
video though I will put links to as much
stuff as I can that I've shown off here
today down in the vias description and
one more reminder that there is another
benchmark Laden video on the Radeon rx
50 750 700 XT coming to you in just a
few hours so subscribe if you want to
see that if the thumbs up button anyway
if you enjoyed this video and thought it
was good and we'll see you guys in the
next one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
