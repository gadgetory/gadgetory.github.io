terrible it's crazy
look we should just about be live now hi
everyone good evening good evening
everyone
it's Tuesday so it's time we're awesome
hardware a little ooh awesome hardware a
live show Kyle and I stream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time so if you're watching live it's
actually 5:40 we're slightly late but
that's as per tradition yeah also per
tradition we occasionally use adult
language on the show so please plug your
gears and don't listen to the rest of
this the rest of the time or just mute
you can mute and watch it on mute then
you won't hear any of that they're much
more attractive that way also drink a
beverage a saucy beverage on the show
we're having some beer right now this is
this is a classic Samuel Adams Boston
lager right now mm-hmm
Kyle I already killed the pale ale from
Sierra Nevadas and penalties so I'm
thinking what you're drinking cheers
thanks for joining us today guys thank
you we're gonna talk about some tech
news and this is the first half of
episode number 184 streaming of my
channel Paul start where the second half
will be streamed to Kyle's channel bit
wit
yeah and that link is in the description
after party will be on his channel -
groovy
looks like we're streaming and things
are good okay so thanks to all of you
guys for joining us today we love you a
quick pitch and a plug for our stores -
Paul's Harbor Nets
we got the Robo love back in stock you
guys you guys were all about the Robo
love and that has been restocked this is
the mousepad but yeah you know this is a
fantasy bit of design it's a great
design there so feel free to purchase
that if you buy awesome hardware merch
from either of our stores we split the
proceeds so don't worry about which
store you buy it from also a bit with
that text slash store for cow store
mm-hmm real good stuff it all comes from
the same place also if you want to order
from both stores place both orders at
the same time they will ship together
you'll get a little bit of a refund for
the shipping difference so yeah that
works yeah pretty much it let's move
into some technology news we got we got
some to talk about this week I'm gonna
be up in the
and enterprise space though sort of some
follow-ups to some of the stuff we
talked about last week in cell had an
event they they have a bunch of like
really high-end enterprise-grade stuff
and it's it's fun to talk about it is
insanely priced for the most part if you
even can tell what the price is but the
the big headliner last week was the 56
korzy on platinum 9200 series of CPUs
the highest end of which will have a 56
course pardon me that's by way of dual
28 core dies on a single package and
they're holding the package with the
sort of a Randy look upon his face I
might say is Ian dr. Ian Contras he
seems quite chuffed I believe as they
say quite shift right to be actually
holding those young platinum 9200
processor in his hand but yeah first off
it's BGA only so these are only gonna
only gonna sell to system integrators
here's a side comparison to a business
situs comparison to a business card by
the way so nobody nobody can actually
buy one of these you can buy a system
that it's based on if you work in IT or
you have insane amounts of money but the
package itself as shown there by you is
76 by 72 point five millimeters Intel's
largest CPU base package ever compared
to the Pentium Pro at sixty seven point
six by sixty two point five that's
that's laughable
Andy's seventy five point four by 58.5
also pathetic now weak inside you got
two xcc enabled Xeon dies which are
pictured here to die for those are also
quite substantially sized 694 square
millimeters each and the socket itself
which we kind of speculated about last
week many many contacts there on the
socket if you can compare it to like an
LG a pin count
this is BGA not LGA but still has many
many contact points
the official socket name is FC BGA five
903
which is really 59 obviously they spent
a lot of time with the marketing
department coming up with that flip chip
ball grid array flip chip ball grid
array which is what is what FC BGA flip
chip is what they've been calling LGA
for quite some time to write ball grid
array processors have a bunch of little
solder balls that go in there and that's
what provides the contact between the
chip and the motherboard but you know
it's soldered on there so you can't
remove it or anything can't pull it off
at least not without knowing what you're
doing with the soldering which it's not
a reflow which is what can be hard so
part of the reason why it's got so many
contacts like that is because it
supports 12 memory channels there's a
side view of it too you can see some of
the layers
it's got like 18 layers at 18 layers
which is a lot more than typical CPUs
out of 8 to 12 and there's 4 different
versions of it
the 9221 is the entry-level I like the
pricing that they listed here head
shoulders knees and toes those are your
options highest and the one that we're
talking about is fifty-six quarter and
twelve twelve thread ten Pentium
I'm sorry Zia and Platinum 9282
for two watt TDP seventy-seven mix of l3
cache 3.8 gigahertz turbo and we don't
know how much it will cost it will cost
your head the comparison in the article
is to the price we currently know of
which is for the Intel Xeon Platinum
8000 series the 80 to 80 L which is the
28 core with a single die and supports
4.5 terabytes of memory and that is just
shy of $18,000 for a single chip so take
two of those and put them together so 25
to 50 thousand dollars for one of them
usually when Intel combine this two dies
together they don't double the price
that they're like well that's where it's
even more than double because of how we
did that or know what they're the
engineering costs of cramming it all
together again we're talking enterprise
level stuff for servers and everything
so I'm sure they I'm sure they've got
customers for these who will spend that
much money
you can actually make money off of I
don't know somehow make enough ROI out
of investment in this type of hardware
that's gonna be crazy to be to work in
IT at that level yeah also like you know
we can build the highest of any
computers that we ever dabble with and
be Ike Wow that cost as much as a car
right this is like wow I caught as much
as a house yeah it's a whole other level
essence that's kind of insane the
insurance on that PC well that's that I
missed so memory channels pricing that
disclosed yeah that's that's pretty much
it articles link in the description if
you guys want to check it out a few more
details in there then I'm not going to
mention right now but why is he eating
it don't eat the CPU you sure don't eat
it in just taking a bite I feel like
that CPU have must have cell
regenerative properties cuz he looks so
young in these pictures
nanotechnology it looks like he looks
five years younger than he usually does
it's clearly the it's clearly a 56
course at work he's not that old I don't
know I know he's not but he just he
looks like he could pass for like high
school in these pictures okay maybe it's
the poor resolution or something or
maybe maybe my eyes are going baby he
drinks the blood of young people I'm
just speculating by the way I don't have
no proof at all that was oddly specific
I feel like you know things that we
don't I just you know I think of ways to
artificially retain your your youth you
know as you become an old person and
that's just makes sense to me okay Paul
is a vampire confirmed okay moving on
sort of in a in a related story this was
also about last week but we didn't
really talk about it and there's a
little bit more information also about
the pricing here this is Intel obtained
dims some memory modules that use Intel
obtain storage which is based on the 3d
crosspoint stuff that they were
developing for quite some time there I
believe that's a picture of one it's
nothing crazy to look at it's just you
know green PCB and apparently they put a
heat spreader on it but obtained memory
right you guys may be familiar with a
little m dot two drives that you can get
that kind of work as a cache
an extra cash in your zoo them that's
been something that I don't know are
people using that I'm using one to boot
off of in my free Nash I used one in our
server build and they've really good
like longevity and stuff like that so
that's cool I don't know if people are
actually using the EM the acceleration
steps again but this is different this
is implementing that implementing that
into actual memory didn't so they they
look just like ddr4 they slot into the
same slots as ddr4 and now they are
going to be available this will sit sort
of between system memory and storage to
provide a very fast extra bit of storage
that sort of acts like system memory but
it's not quite as fast but it's also
persistent so tired if it powers off the
data still stays there but it also acts
as system is so it does both right like
you said it I believe the way this is
describing it it's just it's just acting
a system memory so I stain here's the
pricing it's available in three
different sizes hundred twenty eight
gigs 256 gig and 512 gig and if you
think about that when you're comparing
it's like storage it's like well that's
not that much right paired to memory and
like well that's a lot done yeah and
that's what it's going in and replacing
so if you compare it to the price of
memory it's a great deal if you compare
it to looking at like a single a single
module of 512 gigs is seven thousand
eight hundred and sixteen dollars at
shop BLT pricing by the way is not
coming directly from Intel I guess they
have system pricing guidance these are
the these are the actual prices that
counselors shop BLT and colfax direct
shop BLT sounds like a sandwich shot it
sounds delicious I would love the no
wonder it's so expensive they don't
specialize in computer memory at all so
yeah this is this is this is only for
servers and for people who run servers
with like a whatever my server does eats
up lots of memory you can have lots more
for relatively cheaper of course there
are some requirements like you need an
Intel cascade like Xeon processor but if
you have that you can have up to six
point five terabytes of octane memory
six point high
or bytes of memory kumano that's a lot
of just just like hard drive storage for
some people having that all in memory is
pretty insane and that is of course for
the well that would be enabled it by
those 12 slot Intel platforms that we
talked about the previous thing but if
you bought twelve of the hundred and
twenty eight eating sticks at eight
hundred ninety two or six hundred ninety
five dollars each I guess is the
cheapest that would be six thousand nine
hundred and twenty-four dollars
- good luck relate all those twelve of
the 512 geek sticks $81,000 81 thousand
dollars how much did you spend on memory
for your computer eighty-one thousand a
year's salary like a high-ranking
official or manager or something yeah
yeah that's why it's fun to talk about
this because it's so over the heads of
most people and price range and stuff
but okay it's out there now um if you're
wondering just how much slower obtained
is then memory it's it's slower but it's
not like that much slower so DRAM
latency for reads sequential reads and
random reads it is in the 75 to 80
nanosecond range obtained dims 172 320
nanoseconds so you know more than twice
is slow but we're talking still talking
nanoseconds which it's still very fast
the RAM is typically the only type of
system memory that you measure in
nanoseconds and the price difference
doesn't seem to justify how much faster
the opt-in tips are uh James
how much faster no but how much capacity
is capacity capacity is the selling
point there right
and that's wait did I already scroll
past that oh here no everybody there's
another chart further down
I wonder what without flying a stupid
video Tom's Hardware I don't want to
watch your stupid video
it's not even related to this stupid
article now I can't get rid of it it's
stuck there you can't close that no
there's no X oh my god it's just there
now Tom's Hardware why oh I gotta I
gotta choose the no not that doesn't
even do it that's just the stupid
quality resolution menu I hate I hate it
oh my god sorry some somewhere in this
article there was a
that also should if you stretch the
window down more it'll probably go out
of screen that's right I'll get at least
people on stream I'll do that okay good
for you Chad I accept I scroll down to
forget it we're gonna go I'm probably
just making people sick scrolling up and
down on this page over again
anyway read and write speeds are you
know they vary we got about 15 gigabytes
per second for DRAM and it varies from
0.5 gigabytes per second all the way up
to 7.62 bytes per second depending
whether you're talking about sequential
or random and read or write
where does the other what are you
looking for there was a there was a real
simple chart on here that showed oh gosh
it's right there I've been scrolling
pressed the whole time I'm really stupid
sorry guys conventional DRAM is right
there so four hundred twenty eight gigs
of conventional DRAM you'll pay around
$4,500 so at that price you can see that
128 gig dim that's you know 700 to 900
dollars based on this pricing so that's
a lot better price per gig sure that's
that's the selling point right there
make sense anyway so that's thing now
everyone go buy it and try it out yeah
to other real quick notes about this
comparing the two DRAM has unlimited
endurance asterisk but mostly unlimited
endurance octane games are warrantied by
Intel for five years that is based on
like maximum full-time usage of them but
you know still limited lifespan compared
to DRAM obtain the DIMM will also
consume about three times the power of a
standard ddr4 dimm but 32 times the
capacity in exchange for three times the
power so there you go all right that's
my cool DSM C has made some progress on
their 5 nanometer manufacturing process
now to be clear we're not talking about
a tsmc making x86 CPUs like they do for
AMD with this 5 nanometer process the
stuff that they're actually going to be
producing here is different
SOC designs 5g mobile applications a
high-performance computing so we're
talking about the ARM Cortex processors
and stuff like that but five nanometer I
have no idea if any of this will
translate over to helping them make make
stuff on a five nanometer process for
margin for x86 designs but they are in
risk production like what's risk
production mitotically pasted a
definition here so I could read it to
you guys perfect to be very specific
that means that a particular silicon
wafer fabrication process has
established baseline in terms of process
recipes device models and Design kits
and has passed standard wafer level
right reliability tests okay it's it's a
key point along the road to shipping
something like this in mass quantities
TSMC previously targeted at five
nanometer volume production for 2020
with three nanometers set for 2022 this
process node uses second-gen extreme
ultraviolet and deep ultraviolet
lithography that's EUV and D UV which
you guys might have heard of before
already mentioned what the chips are
going to be all about but one of those
the ARM Cortex 8:27 which is based on
five nanometer which is one that I
actually have a few numbers for will
deliver 1.8 times the density and a 15
percent gain in clock speeds compared to
seven nanometer based on process
refinements alone tsmc also completed
it's 5 nanometer design rule manual
spice model s'en spice model which is a
simulation program with integrated
circuit emphasis and process design kits
which are available for TSMC customers
via TSMC online the chips are in risk
production with alpha customers which
indicates volume production could ramp
in 2020 so basically they're on grounds
hidden cool and we'll probably start to
see these processors pop up in like
smartphones and tablets and other mobile
devices perhaps yes yes and Ken's
and it's worth keeping keeping an eye on
the developments of these ARM based CPUs
because there is
fair amount of movements on the software
side because there's a there's a big
sort of correlation and balance between
the software and the hardware it runs on
and like right now you have Windows
which primarily is there they have an
ARM version of Windows that they've been
developing but it's you know that's
gonna run on x86 so yeah arm has to come
a lot of a long way and there are those
who believe that if something doesn't
happen when it comes to what Intel's
been working on and there's they'll make
some steps forward since its stagnated
for a while that there might be some
sort of overtake in the desktop space as
well for these lower power or like
arm-based processors so right anyway I
wanna dive too much into that because
I'm still learning more about it myself
let's let's move on cool Intel we talked
last week about them hiring tap dad Tom
Peterson yep
they've scooped up yet another marketing
marketing person and from AMD just to go
over there hire so far Rajic Dury
scooped up from Hamdi and as those early
on he designed GPUs over there now this
is all by the way for Intel's GPU push
the the X key Intel I could see GPU
they're working on mm-hmm we got Chris
hook who has been at AMD we're doing PR
for quite some time as well
he's Wiley he's crafty Chris Nick you
gotta watch out for anything and it's
all tumblr and Damian T Damian edit I
don't know how to pronounce Damian's
last name try let trial it is that trio
light if it's friendship might beat wale
but I'm not sure I don't know mi sorry
trio sorry Damien but yeah they're from
technical marketing Ryan shrout and Cal
Bennett both coming from the review
space PC perspective and hard OCP from
Nvidia Mark Taylor as well as tom
peterson who he talked about last week
and now from AMD we have Heather Lennon
you've met her before right yeah oh yeah
Heather yep she's leave we've known
Heather we've been to some AMD events
for her she does the RTG technical
marketing and now do you do until murky
she is there she is just just treat her
written written large what a benefit
like no so maybe try I just just further
evidence that in cell it appears to be
fairly serious about the development of
G fused and given the people that
they've that they're hiring you know it
seems like they're they're definitely
having a name at the mainstream market
because that's what a little bit
specialty of a lot of people that they
have hired it's got to be kind of
interesting to have a bunch of Nvidia
and AMD employees who used to be
fighting each other for so long now
under the same roof where sporting the
same colors and fighting against the
companies that they were previously you
know fighting for yep it's kind of we
she'll be doing digital marketing and
graphics and as Kyle mentioned she'll be
working with Mark Taylor formerly from
Nvidia should mark et I'll probably hate
each other yeah it's cuz you know
loyalty it's a company and run these
former companies friends deep do you
still bleed red we all played red one
last thing here just a video if you guys
want to check it out we I don't know if
you've seen any of this minecraft rate
racing I took a peek at this it's
officially the best looking game of
twenty I know it's so so beautiful
minecraft just continually dropping jobs
with its graphics and everything this
looks like a fastens Creed right here
this is what water effects anytime you
take water effects like that right the
rest of it could just look like really
realistic the rest of it can be blocks
and yeah it's fascinating blockiness of
everything fades away this is
technically path traced shaders which is
similar to but not exactly retracing it
is like a ray tracer on steroids instead
of sending out one ray it sends out tens
hundreds or even thousands of them have
no idea what's a sort of system impact
this has if you need a twenty atti in
order to run it the minimum requirements
for Minecraft just shot through the roof
oh yeah this is this is an add-on mod
it's a mod pack called seuss SE US sonic
ethers unbelievable shaders
works in conjunction conjunction with
Optifine or GLSL shaders mod so yeah any
of you guys who want to rekindle your
love of Minecraft and make it look way
prettier the water effects in this do it
pretty nice too anyway I'll pause this
so you know I'm sure the whole thing
it's like the description if you guys
want to check it out I hear the zombies
now look like the ones from the Resident
Evil 2 remake oh yeah they've got that
much texture neato and one with the long
tongue and everything as well now yep
the licorice they're all just a bunch of
liquors liquors I should have known the
least original name for that zombie okay
okay we have one more segment here which
is ask the audience apparently we don't
have a lower third suppress the audience
at least not here so I've changed it so
what's the deal but it's fine we're
still doing ask the I'll snag all the
updated lower thirds from your place
next week
no worries ask the audience is we ask
you do you the audience questions and
you answer them honestly Cal and I will
do our best to guess the strata of your
answers strata so to speak so I'm gonna
post some links and chat right now good
cells cells already helping out with
that cuz he's since he's honest thank
you so on the ball barrier he's a great
love you daddy great person inside and
out alright so first thing we're gonna
talk about is your iPhone as your
phone's because according to Apple
Insider they did a survey 86 percent of
US teens plan to choose an iPhone as an
x-mark phone what I know we have lots of
teenagers who watch our show so I
thought we would pull you guys is your
next phone going to be an iPhone is it
maybe I mean this girl's is she looks
very very skeptical though she looks
kind of disappointed with your iPhone
she's were getting a decision do you
plan to get an iPhone next time you
upgrade your phone so guys click the
link in the chat and vote on this I'd
like to see you be here now it's very
important who did this who did this
survey
Apple Insider yeah it's Apple Insider
well aren't they a little biased
Kyle you know we gotta ask the audience
something and this seems important very
important rig surveys rig I'm gonna go
through all three questions right now
and then we'll come back and survey you
guys so the next article that the
question is based on is from WC CF tech
because Needham is do blocking
activation codes that are found to be in
breach of EU antitrust laws no yes so
depending where you are if you try to
activate a game on Steam
they might geo lock you and geo block
it's if it's obtained for from a
different country they've singled out
major publishers bandai namco focus Home
Interactive Koch media ZeniMax media for
making geo blocking arrangements with
distributors so we got each we got the
option between a digital single market
and that the EU might be involved with
and then we got what valve says which is
they say these things here
they said the five publishers internet
agreements with their distributors and
included geo block blocking provisions
basically the same just three percent of
games on Steam actually are affected by
the by content region locks at all so I
thought I would ask you guys just a more
generic question rather than one
specifically aimed at this do you think
it's okay to buy software it's
designated for sale and other regions
using the Internet and this is this ties
into like my Windows like Windows the
Windows 10 thing that you can do if you
go and buy it on kinguin or whatever
it's kind of in the same thing right you
can so they haven't for sale in some
regions for less money and that might be
because of people in that region have
less money so if they want to buy it at
all they're gonna be able to pay less
right should you just buy it from
another region and pay less money or
should you not do that should you buy it
in your own region you know go by the
letter of the law those are the options
there I know these are riveting
questions Kyle I can tell you were super
engaged here finally over a - tech tips
on their forums they have a thread
posted by good bytes which is all about
the May
date to Windows 10 also super exciting
you may update you can mention Mac
mix-and-match themes you have a light
theme now look at that no light theme no
dark dark mode is what we all want now
well now we can battle between them dark
mode you can decide you can mix and
match Kyle no it's powerful and like oh
no segregation and I vote for
segregation I forget you're logged in
over here because you have slow play
don't take that out of condo and I go
see what your oh no don't don't look at
my flow plain history that's all you'll
see all the dirty Linus videos I've been
watching here's one thing I actually
like you can uninstall a few more of the
built-in apps including groove music ah
you can uninstall this music yeah I bet
had to interact with the music in so
long so just pops up like it by default
for things all the time and it
constantly tries to reassign itself as
default I haven't experienced that
fortunately anyway there's a bunch of
bunch of stuff here searching Cortana
notepad improvements oh good good
have you figured out the replacement for
the snipping tool yet no what is it
you know the snipping tool is going away
right for what it's gone it's gonna be
done you see it's in your taskbar no I
want to hold on to it no it's gonna be
gone no taking it away don't don't take
it away
I like the snipping tool what what are
they replacing it with well something
inferior obviously and what they're
replacing it with this is perfectly good
I was original I was initially like no
don't take away my snipping tool
you bastard it's now an extension in
edge hit hit Windows shift s oh that's
that's it it's just a hotkey now it's a
different tool so now you can highlight
whatever you want to highlight like that
and then and then what happens and then
it copies it to the clipboard I thought
when I did it before when I did it
before it is it a pop-up down here with
me so there's no there's no actual
window there's no UI for it you just
there is a you enter anyway for it but
apparently it's broken on my my research
what we talking about razor blades in
just a moment on my half so I thank you
for that
you've been hacked that's what that
means so the question for you guys
response to he or burn through these
pretty quick links we get to the answers
how do you handle Windows Update in 2019
I got three options here there's that
there's a fourth option for all the
other the final option probably speaking
is on a damn little bit just try to
update whenever it's possible so it
doesn't do it at a bad time and you know
security updates I pause updates pass
through the major patches because you
can do the positing now I'm like pause
for 30 days or whatever in that way I
talk to you after that or like
third-party software some other option
like that to get around it there you go
okay so those are the questions we shall
ask the audience first question if you
guys remember from four or five minutes
ago iPhones yep so it seems like so long
ago now how much how many of our
audience members are gonna are going to
get an iPhone next time they have great
all right you go first and and okay
since I'm out of beer I don't have any
more beer to chug so I'm just gonna try
to I'm just gonna get ready to get all
of them right consult that yeah I might
not even need to drink any more beer if
I get all these right I can I can read
your minds viewers know what you but why
do that when I have beer
this is clearly the easier choice and
superior one um all right so no
resistance all right look at all these
fans that beer first it's a it's
insulated it's a burst here which is
basically short for beer person it's a
it's like guys who say so too it's not a
man-purse it's a murse that's the same
thing buddy satchel this is actual it's
a beer stein Jill okay that's even lamer
okay go back to back to man first all
right I'm gonna say I'm gonna go with
the obvious one no I'm gonna go yeah I'm
gonna go with the obvious one this is
just so obviously gonna be the answer no
iPhone bad because if you're watching us
right now you're probably on a PC and
not an Apple device so you probably
think the same
you probably choose your phone the same
way you choose your your desktop PC not
a closed ecosystem more options more
upgradability so you think no iPhone bad
is gonna win correct alright so how
we're percentages or we are doing
percentage I didn't I didn't determine
that at all so how by how much what by
what percent do you think no iPhone bad
will beat yes yellow back my love
laughing probably by 79% really you
think it's more no I just think that's a
pretty massive spread especially given
that there's a third option in there to
mess with people but it's okay so minion
was 79
hey I'll say 78% I think people will be
so so convinced by the no iPhone bad
they're all gonna want to do I phone but
even more than your fun option hey
that's how much they big it's bad Oh 67
I almost did 69 so technically it was 48
percent you were only off by 30% oh
right
dammit I was I was thinking okay I was
looking overall percentage yeah I was
thinking overall percentage all right
yeah am I good sure that we clarified
that no you did you did yeah okay
the beers talking you have to the beers
talking well now after drink your beer
now
I can't Matt horrible punishment oh crap
I didn't even lose a nice I could have
just said 69 69 s always the right
answer sure it was very close same
that's always the answer next question
do you think it's okay to buy software
designate for sale
another reason is use it here but buying
ad region will cost more sorry language
was that I'm trying to get through this
quickly what this is one of those things
I set up earlier in the day and as I'm
looking at it now I'm like this is I
guess it's very long it's long what is
this it feels very dry it feels dry
let's let's move it up answer the damn
thing let's move it up a bit
alright I'm gonna say I'm gonna say yes
why pay money less money for the same
product and I think yes will be no by
20% okay I'm gonna say no prevent
fair distribution country don't you
think Noah's gonna win no I don't but
I'm gonna say I'll just do the
percentage then I think it's gonna beat
it by forty percent forty percent thirty
five thirty five percent thirty five
percent twenty percent for me here we go
oh yes Wow I wouldn't you win it was
forty three percent yep take it in the
ass it's good it's good one well done
cap right in the cornhole you've bested
me the burning Ring of Fire
beautiful alright one more oona must how
do you handle windows updates okay in
2019 I'm gonna say I pause updates or
just get major patches is gonna win by
20 percent okay
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
I'm gonna make a random call here if I'm
trying to lose okay I think I think
we're going to have very close a very
close battle between all four answers
okay
we're gonna have a 10% spread which we
know everything is gonna be within a 10%
okay Betsy here let's see that was
totally wrong Wow apparently so many
people are just resigned like look for
windows there that was totally wrong to
look for Windows Update yeah some people
pausing Wow
not many people trying to control with a
third-party app I wouldn't even know
what happened to recommend this for you
know I haven't dabbled with that I have
to imagine those exist but I don't have
the time all right well maybe this means
that Microsoft is right but how they've
handled Windows updates because they
have so many people getting them yeah
getting the updates it is that as a
reasonable there's a reasonable option
there at the top one unless you're doing
something at the time when it's
requesting it which I usually am I
usually always am doing right now always
check for a pending Windows Update
before I render a video mmm that way
doesn't do it in the middle of it or no
I've had because well there been several
times in the past when rendering a video
out fails mm-hmm and I can't figure out
what the heck has happened why it's
happening oh they're never going to head
back knows update do that yeah yeah one
of those one of those things anyway guys
that wraps up for my half of awesome
hard work don't worry we got lots more
