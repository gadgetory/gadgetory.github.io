or white heat spreaders find out more
about the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro
series via the sponsor link in the
description hey guys welcome to this
video I'm in Germany and by the time you
can watch this it should have been
announced and confirmed won I was
invited here by Nvidia I'm attending
games come but also a big announcement
about new Nvidia graphics cards
Archie x-series but before any of that I
have a pretty major problem right now
which is that I'm running out of power I
have lots of international power
adapters at home I forget all of them I
can't plug anything in to charge it so
I'm taking a 30 minute walk to media
market so hopefully by international
power adapter a very existential tagging
here in Germany that makes you think
anyway that I made a left on whipper
further and now I am on via via toaster
theaters I have difficulty pronouncing
German words
so did
- hey this place is pretty awesome
I have appliances very equivalent to
like maybe like a Best Buy or a fries
back in the US but no feels pretty clean
in here I just need to make sure I
prepare where they see a dead person all
right I found what I'm looking for
travel adapters have a bunch over here I
found online that was five year old but
they don't seem to have it available
here they have one of these which is ten
year old and I'm supposed to get a
couple these for Kyle - because he's in
the same situation there's only one of
these these down here twelve just seems
like a lot okay check it out bargain bin
$5.99 for a stacker version I'm just
gonna get a few of these and oh
hopefully a couple of the world alright
success however I did not get it back so
I get to hand carry these now for a half
an hour walk back to the hotel yay on
the way back it started raining which
sucked but I was at least able to
discover where the convention center is
I got my press badge so that's
convenient
but I'm back at the hotel this is where
we're staying it's the Radisson Blu top
great blue though I don't know why it's
blue I made it back I got the AC power
adapters and now we're possibly
through Kyle snuck over because he drank
too much last night also also Nate's
here I'm gonna check for grants back
there too it's like everyone's here it's
almost like it's special inside they're
launching a big product we're entering
the venue
they seem to have put a lot of effort
into the cooling for this place I hope
these aren't for the actual graphics
card probably not the last night they
took us to the Nvidia events livestream
Jenson talked they announced the twenty
series of RT X GPUs RT X 27 to 28 and 28
Ti there's a cool event it was a lot of
fun but we ended up leaving there at 10
p.m. and then I went back to the hotel
shot a video edited a video uploaded
video now it's been about 4 a.m. and now
today is the first day of Gamescom it's
the media day so Sokka do quite as
crowded I'm told Gamescom it's like III
both like 5 times the amount of people
so see if that actually plays out but
for now I'm gonna wander over and check
out the show Fleur
dang Security's tight here they love you
love is pretty empty today fortunately
our imagine relative to tomorrow
oh look I think I see vendor booths
let's see if I can spot any of the new
20 atti card sir that kind of thing
I'm over at the pilot and Gabe reviewed
this is the game where handsome cool
these are just dummy boards that they're
setting these up with but they are
setting up the cooler
for the twenty series twenty eighty
twenty eighty I this is a twenty eighty
I that's a room gain word and I'm told
all of the twenty atti coolers are
triple SWAT
it's like this Phoenix one back here so
this is their Phoenix cooler
these are all in glass cases so I can't
get the best angles on
sighs and bulk at the police
this has a lot of floor space here or is
he buy a horse
this is the mysterious Horace gaming
room where they have a me going on and
the g-force r-tx when ATT gaming OC 11g
from Horace nothing's standing out to me
about this card as it is actually a 2
slot design 2083 slot this doesn't seem
to be true so good job gigabyte a few
managed to make one that can fit into
slots triple fantasize gigabyte with
their coolers
I've really enjoyed some of the Styles
they've had like it's not a black like
the old 9 80s and eyes against being
punch to the cooling but it looks like
there's a decent number of copper heat
pipes in there and everything and you
get full exposure of this new special
envy link SLI bridge this first time
I've seen that
a lot worse in the next few days
tries to explain it to me I never know
what he's talking about but uh I guess
drinkin hi Jacob
okay
it's
look
it's a graphics look up touching it oh
my gosh
this is a EGA rjx
so this is the new box design Oh
saved it almost put even worse gonna
work get a bit in flavors
yeah
redesigned everything from the box of
the card
whereas I see its to technology
precision
they redesign with new features layout
every week I saw some tweets of that
that new layout looks pretty clean you
guys two different versions here this is
the XC version with two fans here so
this will be the mascot
I was actually able to find at least
a version on doing for
price
that's the 28th version of the rgx over
there that is the ignore the win
like your attitude
fan blades it's been the other direction
solution here BB up the bass play down
there for civilians
they also have of course some aesthetic
characteristics to keep in mind so they
were asking our papers
they sort of gray plastic gears it's a
sturdy polycarbonate plastic here so it
doesn't feel clumsy at all
give us your feedback on that they're
considering
three possibilities
so the little accent pieces on the
corners could be replaced swapped up as
red and white versions here there's also
some black versions down at the bottom
put over the top of the fans
maybe also some
sold separately of course but
getting hurt
Gamze come this this thing is huge I'm
comparing it to CES and although CES is
massive it's kind of hard to do a direct
comparison there's ten calls here and
all of them are massive tons of game
development companies there's also
harbour companies so if you're into
gaming and you're in Europe or get I
guess or you have the means to come out
to games come I think it's a lot of fun
I was here on media day I am told that
this is just gonna be completely packed
in the upcoming days when it's open to
the public so I'm actually not gonna be
able to join for that because we have an
Nvidia thing tomorrow they're gonna be
briefing us on some more information but
that's pretty much gonna wrap it up for
this video guys this has been a very
quick kind of light look at Gamescom
also tried to find as many third-party
design gtx 2080s and 2080 TI's that were
out there saw quite a few of those I'm
excited about those it's too bad the
prices are pretty high but for those who
can afford it I'm sure there would be
some excitement when it comes to testing
and everything I'm in the main area
right now kind of the central gathering
area and you can get to all the
different halls from here but I think
I'm gonna wrap this up thanks again for
watching guys hit the thumbs up button
anyway if you enjoy it I'm going to go
maybe travel around Europe a little bit
more yeah that goes have a good one guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
