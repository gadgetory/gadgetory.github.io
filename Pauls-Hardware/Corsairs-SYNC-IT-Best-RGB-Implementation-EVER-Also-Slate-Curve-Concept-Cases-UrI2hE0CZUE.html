to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
coolermaster alright guys I met
Carstairs they have way too much stuff
so I'm not even going to do an intro for
this video I'm just going to start
talking about them let's start with the
big guns this is the concept sleep it's
a concept design that I asked course
there and it sounds like they're
actually going to build this thing
they're actually going to launch it
since it's huge it's actually a
double-wide cake it's got two banks of
120 millimeter fans in the front and
according to them you can fit dual core
turn 80 millimeter 8 Brad's at the front
this will do for animating the meteor
grabbed at the top got a curved tempered
glass teeth across the front as well
big-ass tempered glass side panel now
you might wonder how much a case of this
size would actually weigh it's actually
not terrible when it's not loaded down
with stuff to tell me about 40 pounds
they said however this one as it is
currently outfitted weighs 125 pounds so
probably going to need a two man list of
teams to bring this around or whatever
now of course the case of this size
wouldn't be adequate to just put one
system in so I can't fit two goes all
with ssize pvb size for the motherboard
so for your main system you can fit a
really really huge I'm imagining you
know dual socket boards and everything
like that would fit in here and then
there is an ITX mount it's kind of at
the bottom left of the case so you can
fit a small IKEA kitchen in there
whether you want a dual gaming system or
set up a notch on the bottom with a
really high-end gaming system on the top
anything like that you can't rotate the
motherboard or anything like that
unfortunately however the the radiator
mounts at the front and at the top are
on these slide rails they actually
derived from server slide rail they're
very nice and just pop in and out like
like like drawers basically so you can
slide the rads up so you can mount your
fan or do any maintenance work or that
kind of thing or just to make it more
convenient particularly if you're
setting up a water cooling system
because water-cooled systems are
probably going to be but a case of this
caliber and used for you might also
notice is actually some Corsair liquid
cooling components in there some
custom individual parts I'll talk more
about those in just a second the
tempered-glass channels themselves you
can actually remove so that's very
helpful for transportation simply type
of less is a large portion of the weight
you can just basically open up the side
panel lift a tempered glass panel off
and then that will allow you to you know
reduce the weight or get in there to
work on stuff
three different chambers or specific
areas the area at the bottom is for
power supply towards the front you have
a sort of an area where you can put
these you also on the back have these
two french doors that fold out this is
for cable management and it's just
because you got tempered glass on both
sides and they wanted to make sure
everything is clean even if you were you
know even if you're looking at the
opposite side so it's sort of a flat
panel there but you can open them up and
that will give you access to the chill
management area as well as the SSD
mounting area and then you can mount
your SSD so I think this system is going
to cost they're not giving us a price on
it but again across between like four
hundred and nine hundred dollars that's
about as close as we can get right now
and they do say that they're probably
going to launch this and actually bring
this to market within the next two or
three months so keep an eye out for the
concept sleep I'm not sure if they're
going to change the name port or
anything like that but it's exhale
here's the concept Curt another concept
case is basically a seven eighty which
is made out of carbon fibers so
according to them the carbon fiber work
on this actually curving it around like
that's not a skin that's actual carbon
fiber so the production of the case like
this is going to be very expensive again
it's just a concept they're like alright
we took we took the sleep and we made a
big old case let's take the concept
curve and make a case are really really
high-end materials you also might notice
the new design for their course
two led fan for the prince which sort of
a ring going around the outside that was
pretty cool and those are first RGB LED
this stuff is orange right now because
that's the accent color for this case
and there's a beautiful system again
built in here so I'm very well done no
idea if they're actually going to ever
launch this one this one seems a little
bit less likely than the place but if
you're interested in the concept curve
let corsair know in these comments and
you know i don't know do you guys want a
carbon fiber case should be lighter be
more lightweight than steel that'd be
cool next up we have a pink ish demo
basically corsair has teamed up with msi
msi gave course their access to their
api of course there has taken their
expertise when it comes to programming
RGB lighting which they've been working
on for quite a few years they've been
developing their rj software for quite a
few years to work with the RGB leds
keyboards and perfect what they have
here is a complete solution that allows
you to connect a keyboard a mouse
they've got the mouse pad they've got
the case and the case that we're
actually looking at here is set up in a
570 x case and this is actually a
special version of the 570 x because it
has mirrored tempered glass panels which
means that when the lights are off which
you can do with this software and that's
like i'm going to list that as a key
feature you can turn everything up
you're watching a movie or anything
quick key press and everything turns out
system is completely dark just turn
lights on and you can have you know
right now you're looking at a pretty
typical rainbow bridge or whatever going
through everything but there's so much
more you can do with the solution one
thing i want to point out is with LEDs
here are facing outward normally that's
kind of a no-no when you're putting LEDs
in the case you want to facing inward
the tempered glass is kind of darkened
actually gives it a really cool cool
look now the fans that are up here on
the front our HD 120 is other that's the
configuration that you have is of course
a quarter of course they're RGB LED
keyboard mouse mouse pad mouse pad and
LED strips are all plugged into the
lighting node pro let me know frozen's
connected to the motherboard via USB a
very mine to individually address leds
like this
you cannot just have your typical RGB
connection so you
are going to need to use this wit course
there's hardware but that gives you
again the ability to address each one
individually and they were showing some
really cool demos whether you want just
the colors to go up and through the case
and bounce back you can do reactive
typing on the keyboard that actually
goes from the keyboard to the
peripherals into the case and then back
out of the case as well as a ton of
other various lighting demos and again
since Corsair has been working on their
software for so long it's just it's by
far the most robust example of like
crazy RGB configuration with a computer
as well as the peripherals that I have
yet to speak so again this is called
thinkit's at the complete ecosystem that
courses been working out for a while
oh and I also want to point out that
connected up to each lighting note Pro
you can have up to six strips so that's
a and each LED strip here counts as one
strip in each fan might count as one
strip as well but that's what allows
them to individually address each one
and actually send that lighting up
through the strip's
through the fans and and I just you know
I was getting jaded with LED with RGB
LEDs up some out but my excitement has
been renewed good job core six here's a
quick look at for serious refreshed
hydro series of course there of course
has been I mean today an all-in-one with
employees for quite some time they've
actually had RGB available on their
actual CPU pump block for quite some
time as well
the new design just got more lightning
blue and it's not just the corsair logo
you get sort of a accent lighting around
the outside this was another sort of
accents around the corsair logo on the
actual block itself and they've upgraded
this it looks like they're they're at
least considering a third and 16
millimeter rad version they've also
upgraded the fans they're actually
maglev scans I love my maglev fans very
good performance and very very quiet and
hey it's about time I think of course
they refresh this because you know their
existing ones are pretty nice but I like
both of these especially if you want to
coordinate them with the RGB as I
mentioned Corsair custom liquid cooling
and here it is did you were you in our
students and custom with controlling
your computer were you interested in
purchasing custom liquid cooling
components from Corsair I mean it makes
sense they've been doing all ones for
forever so this is their lineup they're
still working on this but they said
they're probably
going to be launching it within the next
couple months it looks like we have
nickel plated copper I believe we also
have some acrylic or this might be asset
older I don't know how that's pronounced
but here's like an example of one of
their base sleeps for their CPUs really
really clean milling on that which looks
very well done definitely very
professional but they're going to launch
these they again said probably within
the next couple months so you guys are
going to add more options when it comes
to making custom liquid cooling setups
also like the designs have done like
with the caps on the CPU blocks of the
Queen again whole bit more kinda kinda
angular shaved off the corners yeah very
distinct from some of the other stuff
that's available in the market right now
here's a look at the current GPU block
this is going to be a compatible Intel
standard founders Edition at 1080 1080
TI cards I believe 1080p is what this
one is specifically made for you're
going to start out supporting the
founders Edition and then they're also
potentially going to branch out and
bring you other variants that will allow
you to use custom design cards from the
likes of MSI and 80s and that kind of
thing
they've even got some fittings down
there on the end so this is going to be
a complete solution it's not just going
to be a few different parts you're going
to be able to get an entirely custom
liquid-cooled system using all corsair
components back plate here for the cpu
this looks like a oh yeah the channel
thing so you can connect them this looks
like a 3-way SLI configuration that's
pretty cool as well and then as far as
the they're not many radiators on
display over here but they did have at
least one reservoir and they said
they're going to have both acrylic as
well as glass options glass reservoirs
do cost a bit more but they're super
nice and they do a great job at
resisting getting cloudy and finally key
words you guys you guys are probably
very aware that course here makes
keyboards but what's this one down here
look at the k68 mechanical keyboard and
this one is unique not just because it's
available with red backlighting or blue
backlighting that you can see right here
but it also comes with it with an
aquarium yeah you can aquarium fish tank
great there we can raise tropical fish
any any variety of fish that you want
right down they on the bottom then you
can actually type in commands to those
fish on the keyboard that they will
recite back to you or you can
in the swing swim swim in sequence with
each other or obviously I'm making all
this stuff up but a question has the k68
which is destined slow resistance and
they are demonstrating it in this case
which it's kind of hard to see through
but look there's water in the keyboard
the keyboard still works that's the main
point and finally of course there got me
flowers just just to say thank you
that's very very kind of course there to
give me flowers guys thank you so much
