very excited about today's video because
I am doing a build for the first time in
quite some time and I'm also doing it
here in my garage I've been setting some
stuff up this is sort of temporary still
behind me but I've been trying to make
it look a little bit more presentable
I've also got my lights up and running
very excited but just a few days ago or
maybe I guess a week or two ago now a
friend of mine hit me up and said hey
I'm looking to build a new computer and
he actually had some money he was
willing to spend on it so this is the
build that I kind of chose the parts out
for him a4 we're using a few parts from
his old computer though not too much
pretty much just like the memory and he
did get a new monitor of the new Asus
27-inch 2560 by 1440 monitor anyway I'm
going to go over all the parts here in
just a second so why don't we go ahead
and jump in and take a look at my pics
for the parts for this build so there's
a look at all the parts all laid out
nicely this is like one of my favorite
parts of building a new computer is
getting everything assembled taking a
look at everything pristine and in its
new boxes this is a gaming PC not
necessarily going to be used for much
more than PC games and Internet so that
kind of factored into my choice for the
parts not shown in these collection of
parts is an addition that I did later on
which was one of my white LED strips
from Taiwan so you see that when the
completed build comes together my friend
wanted a GTX 780 or 780 Ti after the 780
Ti pricing result was released I opted
for the 780 simply because it's $200
less and I don't really feel like the
performance Delta between them really
warrants the 200 extra bucks for the 780
Ti although that is an absolutely
wonderful card for the CPU we got an
Intel Core i5 46 70 K I did go a little
bit more budget on this one instead of
the 4770k no hyper threading here but it
is a great gaming processor and it is a
bitch cheaper than the 4770k
also next year we're expecting a Haswell
refresh and we're expecting also that
those CPUs will be droppin on socket
1150
a z87 motherboards so there will be a
cpu upgrade path hopefully if that's
really becomes necessary in the future
for games like Battlefield 4 that are
actually really utilizing even more than
four cores motherboard is the MSI z87
GD 65 you get a lot for the money with
this motherboard aesthetically looks
really nice black and red so I did have
a color scheme going for this build and
it's got everything you need really for
a gaming system now if you're
questioning this because you will often
see me use ASUS motherboards I do
generally lean towards Asus when it
comes to motherboard selection it was a
really really tough choice between this
one and the rog hero eventually I did
choose the MSI GD 65 because of the
price point but if you're looking for a
drop-in solution for this build the rog
hero is a great option as well and also
fits the color scheme I do have a GTX
780 from Asus right here we got their
directs you to OC this one's a beast
the 780 is based on the gk110 it's
absolutely a blistering fast GPU also
nice and quiet with the custom cord from
Asus on the direct co2 version and a
nice little bonus you get some free
games so here's my buddy's game cards
unfortunately I don't get to keep any of
these but you back Batman Arkham origins
Splinter Cell blacklist and Assassin's
Creed Black Flag very nice add-ons from
Nvidia now I mentioned that memory was
one of the things that we carried over
from the old build so here is a Corsair
Vengeance 8 gigabyte ddr3 1600 low
profile black memory kit this is a 2 by
4 gig kit and then I'm carrying two
other four gigs sticks over from his old
2500 KP 67 system that's what he's
upgrading from fortunately the exact
same memory is still just as effective
in this new platform so he's gonna have
16 gigs total for mass storage we have a
WD Western Digital 2 terabyte green hard
drive
low power mass storage 64 Meg cache on
this one pretty much a no-brainer now
you need some extra storage beyond the
SSD and this is a great hard drive and
it stays nice and quiet doesn't loot
doesn't use much power we got an Asus
DVD burner as well pretty much my my
friend wanted a DVD burner an optical
drive so 20 bucks it burns DVDs and he's
already got a PlayStation 3 he uses for
blu-ray so we don't really need that
this is a courser h7d
CPU closed-loop cooler and this one is
slightly used so I carried this over
from another system and kind of brought
it in at the last minute the h7t itself
is discontinued so if you guys do click
the link in the description for my my
wish list build I actually dropped an H
ATI in there because I feel like it's a
pretty easy drop-in solution for that
and it's a slight upgrade from the H 70
so I did choose this because it has a
thicker radiator when it comes to
hundred and twenty millimeter
closed-loop coolers I prefer thicker rad
versions and then I paired this up with
a corsair SP 120 that's their static
pressure optimized fan because the age
70 does not come with a fan and this one
looks cool and I kept the black and
white look to match with the fractal
stuff Samsung 840 Evo 250 gig is our SSD
this is one of my favorites in recent
memory comes with a absolutely fantastic
software package from Samsung which I've
used several times has secure erase
features and stuff like that and this
one is super fast it really comes very
very close to the Samsung 840 pro which
is just about one of the fastest ones
out right now so this is going to be for
the Windows 7 operating system as well
as frequently used games for power we
have a fractal Tesla r2 800 watt power
supply really liked in this power supply
it's 80 plus gold great price for an 80
plus gold power supply I like the look
of it it is non modular but we still
have plenty of room and the define r4
case for all the extra cables and I went
with 800 watt because we want a head
room for another GTX 780 because I think
my friends pretty set on actually
setting up SLI in this system eventually
although not right off the bat because
he just dropped a lot of cash already
the fractal define r4 case is our case
it's the windowed version you guys have
probably seen this before if you watch
my channel this is a solid functional
and quite nice-looking case as well and
lastly we cannot forget to the audio we
have a creative Sound Blaster ZX I
really like the newest offerings from
creative when it comes to their Sound
Blaster Z series the ZX is a really nice
audio card so upgraded for his headset
that he's already got which is a sin
Heiser PC 360 which is very nice little
headset so he's going to be hearing some
extra nice audio with the sound blaster
ZX I also like that it's got the little
audio control module it
out on your desk because I hate front
panel connector mic and headphone jacks
and it's also got a 600 ohm amp so if he
does decide to upgrade his headset in
the future he'll be all set so that's
the hardware that we're currently
working with and without further ado I'm
just going to kick off a nice time-lapse
of the assembly of this beast of a new
gaming computer
I
you
you
you
you
so as you can see guys the build came
together without a hitch I know this is
going to be a beast of a system really
glad that we were able to jump in and
grab a 780 right after the price drop
for just five hundred instead of $650
and I know this is going to be working
for my buddy for quite some time so next
thing is for him to take it home plug it
into that new asus monitor get some
games up and running I'm sure we're
going to jump in and I'm able play some
add in a battlefield 4 maybe just like
old school old school Starcraft I played
Starcraft in a while like not the new
Starcraft old anyway but thank you very
much watching this video guys if you
enjoyed it go ahead and let me know also
let me know if you want to see more
build videos like this one because I
love doing them and if you enjoy seeing
them hit the like button down there
leave me a comment down in the comment
section and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
