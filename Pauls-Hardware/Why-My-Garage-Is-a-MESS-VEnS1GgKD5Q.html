lately but that's besides the point what
I wanted to start this video off by
saying is that I am a very practical
person I like to do things practically
logically and I also like to get two
things done at the same time so my
practical logical dilemma today is that
I need to make a video for one that's
kind of my job that's what I do
for two I once again have a very messy
garage I've done garage work logs clean
ups before where I've you know shown the
cleanup of the garage and I go it's
satisfying today I thought I'd do things
slightly different this is actually
actually been asked once or twice before
which is like what is all that stuff
actually how does this table get so
messy with things so I'm actually gonna
go through the things and hopefully very
quickly talk about what each thing is
and maybe you will be like ah I was
wondering that or maybe you're just
baked Wow Paul you are able to create a
very a very large mess very efficiently
either way I'm gonna get two things done
at the same time today so let's get
started let's start from this corner
first off just recently did the video on
this one that SK six to one little 60%
mechanical keyboard from Coolermaster I
never put it away next up is a set of
things actually quite a bit of the
clutter on this table which is the
leftovers from my cable management
project probably gonna be a theme going
through all this stuff is it's a lot of
leftover things from old videos but next
we have power cables extension actually
have a drawer full of these because you
can never have enough power extension
cables and then this very useful device
here which is actually the AC adapter
for our gh 5 actually also works for the
gh force that allows me to run them for
a very long time without having to worry
about the battery running out we use
this all the time so I'm just gonna wrap
up the cables and leave it out various
fan mails that have come to my P o box
or to Cal's P o box that we opened
during the live show I have a place
where I stash all these and then these
I'm hopefully gonna follow up on so I
hope I don't forget that here are what I
use now instead of USB thumb drives I
still use USB thumb drives but I really
recently became addicted to just using
SSDs with USB 2 SATA adapters if they're
USB 3 you can get most of the
performance out of a SATA SSD so the
games 1 for example I can just plug into
a new computer I've set up set it as a
steam library and then it'll just sort
of record
is all the games on there and then I can
start playing them without having to
copy them onto the system itself next we
have video cables which I also use
extensively all the time
HDMI thankfully with hdmi 2.0 you can do
higher refresh rates and higher actual
resolutions DisplayPort of course is the
best to use but I don't have a
DisplayPort capture device yet I kind of
hope that they'll develop one of those
at some point and not only would I use
these for connecting up like a new build
so I can test it but also for cameras
because I do lots of video capture so
HDMI out of the camera and into a
capture device so that's why I have so
many of these I always have a fair
amount of tools just scattered around
the table if I haven't been doing my due
diligence you staying cleaned up it's
actually really cool like ruler with a
bunch of different measurements and
stuff it's made by mm PC tech I tend to
keep a lot of tools just kind of stashed
at this end of the table but this is
hopefully something I'm gonna deal with
today
is making a slightly better situation
for that here's a mark to clean a
thermal material remover and surface
purifier the best solution for cleaning
thermal paste so you can reapply it I
always have some of this around and it
always gets left out because I use it to
clean thermal paste so goes in that
drawer where the thermal paste lives
here's the box for the stream deck from
El Gato I actually have the larger and
the smaller version of this I've started
setting it up for our live streams so
I've got starting my stream on pulsar
we're starting cattle stream on bit whit
awesome hardware on switch switching
between a few scenes there's a bunch
more stuff you can do with the stream
deck but I've only just gotten started
with it but it has been convenient okay
I can get rid of the box though eh5
actually have two of these Joe's using
one to film right now this one is
usually set up to capture with here but
for some reason the elgato 4k 60 pro
capture card that I have in that system
over there doesn't like to play nice
with at least one of the GH 5s I found
that the gh4 it does just fine with I've
been swapping my Sigma 18 to 35 lens
onto that to shoot the livestream and
then this hangs out until it's ready to
go again
I guess I'll put it over here with my
other cameras now we also have several
other pieces of computer part computer
parts PC parts a memory and
until SSD the box for a rise in 1600 cpu
the cooler and all of this was the parts
or at least some of the parts that went
into the cooler master q 300 l over here
which is a bill that I did in April they
also sent me these for the Q 300 or Q
500 L which er these Paul's Hardware
front mesh designs they sent me four of
them the case only uses two I don't know
what to do with these now I'll figure it
out at some point I suppose but when I
have a build that's been put together
there's two things that usually happen
either the build is going to stay
together and be used in which case I
take all the empty boxes and I put them
in the case box or I take the system
apart since the motherboard and this
system is actually defective the m dot 2
slots are not working i am going to take
it apart so i can automate that
motherboard also from this build we have
the part that i cut out to provide a
little bit more airflow there this is
just a hazard now it's very sharp at the
edges I think I'm just going to toss
this to the recycle bin
these are video cards that have been
used in builds that are getting put back
into their retail boxes we have an MSI
r-tx 2070 because when I originally did
this build last month I tried to put
like $1,000 $1,100 system in this little
case of which I no longer recommend
because the case doesn't have that good
at air flow we're hoping coolermaster
does another revision because I like the
overall design of the case it's just
poor air flow so that's why this 2070 is
still out and then we also have two more
GPUs that were also used in the pared
down version of this system which is
about $600 and that would be the RX 570
right here
Oris version of that and then also as
attack gtx 1650 look how much more clear
and open the table has already become
this is this is awesome this side of the
table I tend to crop out of shots women
when we're filming stuff over here and
that's because it tends to be just my
repository for these little trays of
screws and other mounting equipments
from various builds that have been done
in the past I have two packs of Linus
tech tips first edition cable ties that
Luke gave me at CES and that have been
sitting here ever since I have a GoPro
Hero 7 black actually got one of these
to bring on our Hawaii trip earlier this
year then the housing was coming loose
which it's not supposed to do because
waterproof so this is the replacement
which I have yet to open we're on sort
of the last steps right now so I am
putting away the remaining tools that
are still out over here I have a box
with screws velcro's and zip ties so
that is where the velcro and the zip
ties go twist ties and a bag of baggies
this is my existing bag of baggies these
go back in here I really need to
organize that cupboard maybe add some
drawers hopefully a future project it's
also after these and these are actually
pieces from the doctor's aber century
2.0 case and I need to pack this one up
to ship by the time you see this video
it should have already been shipped to
the winner who's recently picked so I
guess I've moved from cleaning the table
off to now using the table for something
useful that being packing this giveaway
system up to ship out all right that is
satisfying to finally get a system
that's made for giveaway all packed up
and ready to go I just need to find a
box big enough to hold all these things
so the only things I have left here on
my workbench table are the gamers Nexus
pod mats this this smaller one obviously
is affordable quality check out my video
on that but anyway that is gonna wrap it
up for this video guys I hope you have
somewhat enjoyed watching me tidy and
get things back into proper order so I
can actually make some content once
again if you saw me packing anything up
and putting it away here that you were
interested in when it comes to the
videos that I did on those things I will
link those down in the video's
description and I'll be back with more
regular pulsar content coming at you
real soon thank you so much for watching
hit the thumbs up button anyway out and
we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
