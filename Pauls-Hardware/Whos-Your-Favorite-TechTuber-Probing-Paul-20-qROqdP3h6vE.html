description and get inspired for your
next project hello everyone and welcome
to this month's episode of probing Paul
I have a lightsaber or no no real reason
at all but it is October 2017 this is a
monthly Q&amp;amp;A video that I do every month
hence it being monthly and this is
episode number 20 if you want to go
check out the past episodes there's a
playlist for probing Paul's and you can
go back and look at all the old ones
I've been doing this for almost two
years now
I made a joke last time that not
everyone got but um let's just get right
into it shall we the first question here
is from that guy shared and I believe
this is from right sure what's up right
here hey Paul who is your favorite tech
youtuber very good question I should
have thought about the answer before I
read that that question but all right I
like the youtubers who are doing the
real serious in-depth testing and
analytical work out there right now so
gamers Nexus I think stands out there to
me they've got a lot of flack from
people but I think it's because they
they Steven and the career over that
takes a very critical look at anything
that they get coming in so oftentimes
they point out stuff critiques that
maybe aren't always caught they also do
very extensive testing so that's pretty
cool definitely more extensive than I do
over here although based on some of the
stuff they've done has encouraged me to
improve some of my own techniques over
time beyond that I would say hard
Hardware unboxed has been doing an
insane amount of really good testing of
a lot of the recent launches of CPUs and
GPUs that have come out so Steve from
Hardware unboxed and and career over
there is doing a fantastic job as well
and I feel like again I should have
thought more about this I saw the
questions like oh that's a good question
I'll pop it and I just should have done
more
like some more small techie to youtubers
out there
okay gave it a little thought and Andrew
from tech team GB I like I've seen quite
a few of his videos and I met him at
Computex this year and he's a really
nice guy so if you want a smaller
Channel just wanted to point out a
smaller channel out there to tech Team
GB this his channel I'll post a link to
that in the description
next question though from Tim Murphy
what's the most expensive thing you have
broken another really good question
that I thought about and I was like oh
there's got to be some good answers at
the Eck I couldn't think of anything
that was like supremely substantial that
I've actually just gone out and broken I
don't know I don't know if I'm just
lucky or not as clumsy or what like I'm
definitely not like super coordinated or
anything like that like I never played
sports growing up or that kind of thing
so I do have a couple examples of things
that I have that are broken that I maybe
have broken one way or another this one
I've discussed a little bit this is one
of my original 2gh fours and I broke the
HDMI out on it that's actually a micro
HDMI out which is not very sturdy behind
this little tab here and I smashed a
couple the pins down in there
via constant plugging Andry plugging of
it this camera is still perfectly
functional as a camera however I can't
do HDMI out on it which limits some of
my use of it although I still haven't
been using it so that's probably not the
best example a broken thing that I have
is this AMD Athlon FX 62 at Athol on 64
FX 62 which back in the day cost about
$1000 and this CPU is now broken or at
least it was last time I tried it which
was probably over five years ago now so
I trust that it probably is still broken
and it is a thing that was expensive at
the time it is a very very drool-worthy
product too so I'm glad I still have
that kind of curious now that I've
brought that up I should like plug it
back in and see if for some reason it's
come back to life or something because
it's not like it has busted pins or
anything it was just non-functional
anyway sorry if I don't have better
answers for that if you guys have ever
seen me break something in a past video
or like back in that new way in the new
ignition and I'll point it out next
month alright next from
Shaker Hobgoblin hey Paul loved the
videos I've recently built my first
computer it's a rise in seven 1,700 with
the GTX 10 atti coming from an AMD a6
6300 and an OEM GT 705 so he had a
pretty nice upgrade here from that cpu
in that GPU 2 to the rise in 7 1700 and
a 1080 Ti his question is what's the
biggest hardware jump or biggest upgrade
that I've ever had this also got me
thinking back to the past and upgrades
I've done in everything I couldn't come
up with a good GPU answer for this
because I've upgraded my GPUs pretty
regularly I went from a 7800 GTX to a
GTX 260 core 216 so I believe I had to
weigh GTX 460 s at some point and then
after that was when I started working at
new AG more and I wish I would I would
swap see GPUs out all the time so it's
harder to say yeah I had this specific
graphics card for specific period time
but to give you a better answer Pentium
4 I had a Prescott based Pentium 4 and a
socket 478 which looked very similar to
this one right here in fact it might
have been like this exact model I don't
remember the exact model off the top of
my head here but I used that up until
2004 2005 jump from that to an Athlon 64
3200 Plus which was my first dual-core
processor this was a 67 watt TDP dual
core AMD this is this is again back in
that time frame when AMD was kind of
kicking kicking Intel's butt and
although this was an early dual-core it
still wasn't that cheap I think when I
got it it's it would be the green line
here and I think when I got it it was
right around the $200 price so yeah not
terrible for a dual core and then I
jumped from that a couple years later in
2008 timeframe to an i7 920 and this was
my first enthusiast platform you know I
had to get on the Intel enthusiast
platform when it was available so I'm
actually gonna used LGA 1366 motherboard
and that allowed me to invest the 300 to
320 dollars in the i7 920 and that got
me up to a quad core with hyper
threading and that was my processor for
quite some time so that's kind of my my
remembrance of my CPU upgrades in the
mid to late 2000s and I think those were
those stand out to me is like I was
stoked each of those times that I made
those upgrades and I used those systems
for a couple of years each at least so
that's pretty good there next question
is from Joe tippet and this is a long
question I'm not going to read the whole
thing but it's there on the screen if
you guys want to but basically he's
thinking about a system upgrade he wants
to maybe upgrade to Rison right now he
has a Xeon e3 1231 v3 which is a quad
core and it's a he's got a gigabyte z97
MX gaming 5 so his current system isn't
all that old although it is a Xeon and
he's got 4 by 4 gigs of course ever
engines Pro 24 100 megahertz memory so
he's got a pretty decent system right
now and he's just saying like he's been
itching to upgrade is it worth it to
upgrade to Rison especially since he's
been looking at our threes now just to
make long story short here my advice to
you Joe directly would be I wouldn't
upgrade from this your Xeon e3 1231 V 3
2 horizon 3 because you'd be going from
a quad core to a quad core and honestly
I haven't looked at direct comparisons
with the xeon 83 but you're not gonna
even see much of a single core
performance difference between those i
would say only upgrade if you're ready
to drop the cash on a6 core or an 8 core
on that platform until then just hold
out because things aren't gonna get more
expensive probably unless you're talking
about memory they're probably gonna get
less expensive when it comes to
motherboards so yeah I wouldn't side
grade over to another quad core on the
rise in platform but you are correct
that there is an upgrade path for socket
am 4 and AMD has promised to keep
supporting it with CPUs through 2020 so
that's a couple years still to go maybe
a little more a little more than two
years so I would say hold out until you
can afford that 6 core of the 8 core to
give yourself a little bit more of a
like yes I upgraded feeling especially
if you're looking at the pure CPU
performance there but thank you though
Joe and next question is from Papa doom
and this question has been asked before
so I thought I'd answer it again just
really quickly because people ask me
pretty frequently
but Papa Dumas hey Paul my question is
how you earn money I mean what do you do
except YouTube or do I only do YouTube
the answer is right now I only do
YouTube and I've only been doing YouTube
for about the past 3 years now
give or take I started doing YouTube
independently on my own when my channel
had about was between 80,000
ninety thousand subscribers right now I
am creeping up very ever so slowly on
the 700,000 subscriber mark and it's
definitely a difficult thing to do to
make a living out of making YouTube
videos unless you can do it consistently
you have to have the passion to be able
to keep coming back to it time time
after time so you need to have some sort
of topic or subject matter that you're
enthusiastic about but I wouldn't
recommend starting a YouTube channel and
saying this is gonna be my job started
as a hobby first do it for a while and
then if you enjoy it and if you feel
continue to feel passionate about it
even if you're not making that much
money then maybe it's something you can
keep investing your time into to the
point where you can earn enough money my
money though comes from four basic
locations location one is if you watch a
YouTube video on YouTube and you get a
pre-roll ad beforehand or YouTube bread
alternatively either way those little
bits revenue to go YouTube get shared
with me and I get some money there so if
you do want to whitelist my YouTube
channel that's much obliged but hey if
you don't then don't worry about it
because I also integrate ads there's
probably an ad at the beginning of this
video I try to make them very short keep
them about 20 seconds or so so if you're
watching on the YouTube app you can
DoubleTap let's skip it pretty quickly
try game shorten to the point those I
coordinate directly with vendors such as
like gigabytes or Coolermaster that kind
of thing I also have a store where you
can purchase stuff that store is linked
in the video's description I don't make
a ton of money from the store we're not
huge in a merchandising but it's a
little bit so I'm stuff like this
awesome hardware shirt that I'm wearing
right now is available there as well as
oh yeah look I can advertise look I also
have bottle openers now so store is
another way and then last way is going
to be affiliate revenues so if I talk
about a product such as you know a new
motherboard or CPU or whatever and I say
this is available at Amazon and I put in
Amazon link in the description to it
that code that was an affiliate link and
so if you go to Amazon and then you end
up buying that product or anything else
for that matter I think within the next
week or so then I might get a cut of
that as well depending on the product
that you purchase so those are my four
main means of income and thankfully I
also have a wife who works full-time who
provides me or who adds me to her health
insurance and that's how I get health
insurance as well and that has
a pretty reasonable means of us getting
by paying our bills and making sure that
the mortgage payments go through so
there you go a quick rundown of how I
makes the monies on the youtubes let's
move on to Nolan Flynn can I replace the
central heating in my house before in
Vegas 64 liquid cooled overclocked
graphics cards Nolan yes you probably
can it might not be the best most
cost-effective solution since Vegas 64
cards tend to be fairly overpriced right
now they've come down a little bit but
they're still fairly overpriced and and
since they're made to do stuff besides
just producing heat granted I have your
questions probably not that serious but
I'm answering it seriously I don't care
over on PC Gamer there's an article
linked in the description about a
company in France we talked about this
on our live show a few weeks ago they
are building computers that are going to
be used for servers cloud computing
systems but also they're gonna function
as home and office he heaters anyway I
don't want to go too far into this but
the articles linked in the description
so they have an actual somewhat feasible
means of taking a useful thing like a
computer that also happens to generate
heat putting it somewhere where that
heat generation can put the heat to good
use I guess anyway let's move up all
right Waleed Shah has the next question
this is more of a comment or pointing
out of a thing or a follow up from
something I've talked about in the
previous video when we talk about
Windows 10 licenses he's pointing out
that if you change Hardware with Windows
10 it is possible to swap your hardware
and still maintain your Windows 10
license he links to a Windows central
article on doing that I have included
that link in this video's description as
well and basically the solution is to
set to connect your Windows 10 license
with your Microsoft account which is a
total valid way of doing this it's not
something that I've advocated very much
or even shown how to do before because
basically you're taking your license and
instead of attaching it to your hardware
you're attaching it to yourself
personally and you can take that license
and go to some other completely random
Windows 10 computer and still be able to
sign in I'm sorry that Microsoft account
still be able to sign in with the
Microsoft account what that does is one
requires you to have a Microsoft account
too it also means that Microsoft can
track you around with
you're doing and everything which you
may or may not be okay with hey Google
does a lot so maybe you're absolutely
fine with that the way that I like to
activate Windows 10 though is to
activate it to the system not using the
Microsoft accounts when you do that it
takes whatever key that you get it burns
that key that Keys gone it creates a new
unique key that's specifically tied to
your hardware your motherboard as far as
I can tell and the testing I've done and
then that key is now attached to that
Hardware forever which means if you were
to go and wipe Windows off of that take
that Hardware and have a completely new
say SSD or something and install Windows
Windows 10 onto it again you should just
it should just activate it should
recognize the hardware know that they
already have an activated key in their
database attached to that hardware and
then it should just work again that's
happened to me and with at least three
different systems that I've done this
with before and I guess to come back to
the original question yes it is a valid
solution to do a Microsoft account
attached Windows 10 license and then you
can have that and you can use it
yourself and it's a valid way of doing
it it's just not something that I've
done very much before so that's why I've
mainly advocated the old-school method
of tying the key to your hybrid but yeah
nothing wrong with that either and that
is all the questions I have for today so
guys I hope you have enjoyed this has
been probing Paul episode number 20 hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
and I am gonna get back to work on my
cleaning have you guys notice it's kind
of clean done some cleaning and stuff
lately stoked on that anyway I'm gonna
get back to work thank you guys so much
for watching we'll see you guys next
