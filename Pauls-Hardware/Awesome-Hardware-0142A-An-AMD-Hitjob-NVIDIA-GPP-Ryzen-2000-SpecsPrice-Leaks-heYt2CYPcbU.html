you wanna up support us and our YouTube
channels and stuff then check out our
stores my store is Paul's hardware nets
we've got some new Heather shirts -
Heather Navy so we have the awesome
hardware shirt in Heather Navy now which
is super awesome oh yeah so check that
if you buy awesome hardware gear the the
profits are split between and Kyle and
myself so don't worry about that
bye
either store I've also got a new
lightweight zipper hoodies as well so I
ideal for springtime not quite as cold
weather and that sort of things so
thanks to guys who shop on my store if
you want to shop on Kyle's store it's
bit wit dot text slash store he also has
a wide array of high quality merchandise
including mouse pads and awesome
Hardware here and all kinds of stuff
well shout Johnston at you if you happen
to pick something up at the end of the
show unless you want the Heather dark
gray CPU cooler shirt it's all them yeah
can't have that coming back and stock
none of that alright and that's that's
how the show works that's our intro yep
that was like the five minute intro
we're like five minutes late and we did
a 5 an intro so now now we're back on
schedule I think ok today I'm just gonna
dive right into the news in fact news is
my only segments that I have today so
we're gonna we're gonna try to give you
guys some in-depth conversation about
some of the stuff that's been happening
happening in the tech world just
recently I've been asked about many of
these things on the Twitter's yes and
we'll start off with the big one that
just dropped today this was a security
flaw with AMD processors AMD Rison
processors that was disclosed by a
research a security company called CTS
labs now I want to say please read
everything or listen to everything about
this story before passing judgment and
freaking out about your new AMD Rison
processor because this is somewhat
scurrilous the at least the the origins
or at least if not the origins at least
the way that this has been brought for
us to people and an informed to AMD as
well as to the public has been pretty
Shady at least by the company
responsible that's not to say that there
is no legitimacy to these potential
flaws however usually if you have say
something like the Spector
vulnerability inspector and meltdown
right typically if you're a security
researcher you would give the company
who's in charge of that software or
hardware whatever you're looking into a
vulnerability for some kind of window
in order to prepare themselves before
you go public with whatever flaw you
have found usually it's 90 days
sometimes 60 days in this case they gave
Andy 24 hours Wow
and you had 24 hours notice so like
literally yesterday Andy found out about
this that's really not any time at all
and today the research the security
company cts labs which was based in
Israel published a white paper
identifying four classes of potential
vulnerabilities that affect Rison epic
Rison Pro and rise in mobile processor
lines now apart from the really really
really short amount of time in that AMD
was given which is really crappy that's
a stupid thing to do
it's late that's lame there there are
tons of other just really shady things
going on with this so I'll just start
with the like that I'm going to start
with the conclusion at least the
conclusion that I have come to which is
that there is a company involved here
called Viceroy research they have a
history of doing things to affect stock
values and then attempting to profit
from it so here's what you have a short
sale situation where they knew they had
this information that was potentially
damaging to AMD they stored it up they
created a website they built it there
was very very obvious like premeditated
stuff going into the setup for this
including the website that was created
including the video that they published
on YouTube which has a bunch of issues
with it as well like they knew about
this way way more than 24 hours prior
and yet they gave AMD 24 hours and they
were attempting at least according to a
lot of the speculation from people who
have been talking about this to affect
AMD stock price in a way that they could
profit from it mmm so yeah they even
hired a PR firm to deal with incoming
requests for information after they
published this the website they created
for specifically that goes over the
vulnerabilities I'm not even gonna show
you guys but it's called AMD flaws com
it was registered by Viceroy Research
through a
one of the the like a the shell company
or the the Registrar masking companies
so you can actually tell tell what it is
CTS research research itself the company
that supposedly did all of this was
founded only seven months ago and has
published zero like actual documentation
of any they've done nothing prior to
this this company was created and this
is the only thing that they have done so
that's kind of crappy too if you guys
are interested there's four or five
different links in this video's I have
links to all the stories I'm talking
about in the video description on
YouTube guys so if you want to check it
out there's also a link to the AMD
subreddit now please may I remind the
AMD subreddit can lean AMD a lot of the
time but there is a pretty good
accumulation expect of the accusers AMD
flaws the website itself as well as
Viceroy Research the Viceroy research
article itself is titled AMD the
obituary like they were very very
obviously trying to target AMD and
condemned them outright without giving
them much chance to respond or anything
like that and there's a bunch of
articles on it from various tech
publications and that kind of thing that
have varying titles and here's like my
my kind of hesitation and even
addressing this today was like some of
these titles are a lot more like sound a
lot scarier than that others right and
if you're if you if you do tech
publications and you know you try to get
traffic right and that's the that's
that's clickbait right clickbait is
there because people want people to
click on stuff because if are going to
make more money if people click on
things and if you have a title like hey
everyone who bought rising processors in
the past year it all screwed you guys
have a big security flaw obviously
that's going to get a lot of traffic
going to your website potentially so I
hesitate to condemn anyone who's
published an article on this there's
varying levels of like sort of fear
integrated there and there's varying
like like wording in the titles some
which sounds more like dangerous than
others so anyway all that said they're
all linked here there's
for the threads on these as well there's
probably going to be more stuff coming
out of this because like I said this
only this only came out earlier today
and AMD I mean I guess ends up tomorrow
well I don't know I don't know if Andy's
gonna have and they're probably I can
have anything done as far as software or
firmware updates or anything like that I
was following this on Twitter a little
bit today this is just a random tweet
from Jeremy Owens he is a tech editor
for market watch he says from security
folks he's seeing discussed the Andy
report it seems that the exploits
required level of access that would mean
he could pretty much do whatever you
want I Ryan Scott was also following
this a little bit so that the the
exploits themselves require admin access
on the machine so if if an attacker has
admin access on your machine you're kind
of screwed anyway that is not to say
that there's no validity to these
potential exploits as it is but it's not
something that it's it's not at like oh
my god everyone you know burn your eyes
and processors and sell your AMD stock
it's not level of vulnerable and and any
assessments of the the the level of
danger to the the vulnerabilities right
now is pretty premature anyway because
there's really not been much time for
anyone to do much research on this
there's a ton of criticism of the white
paper itself from various people in the
tech community just as far as how it's
put together the wording in the white
paper which is a lot less white paper
and a lot more the type of wording that
that you would use as an investor when
it comes to like oh this is doing good
versus this is doing bad so yeah they're
this there's a lot of issues there and
is there a possibility that it could be
100% false probably not okay there is an
underlying solidity to the flaws so
don't write this off completely but it's
it's hard to get an accurate assessment
of what's going on right now because it
was revealed in such a reckless and
obvious obviously like slanted way in
order
to create an outcome that the publishers
could profit from in some way and before
and without giving AMD any proper notice
yeah they could prepare for whatever
damage control would fall oh yes
so it's just pandemonium right now yeah
and I mean the fact that the fact is
there's a like here are shots from the
video that they made about how this was
deeply concerning to us and everything
and they green screen these guys talking
about it over obviously stock footage of
like offices and stuff like that so like
CTS labs the company itself this is not
CVS labs where these guys are they're
probably you know just a little storage
room yeah and nothing like that and you
know this is that all the time like
people do green screens and put
themselves in front of some professional
looking office environment or whatever
but when you can tell that it was done
in a way that's obviously and got some
some sort of there's there's intent
behind it yeah they're trying to see
more incredible than they probably are
yeah the fancy lab where the CTS
research website I'm sorry the the AMD
flaws website also has a pretty
extensive disclaimer at the bottom which
states opinions expressed in this report
are not investment advice nor should
they be construed as investment advice
or any recommendation of any kind also
we may have either directly or
indirectly an economic interest in the
performance of the securities of the
companies whose products whose products
are the subject of our reports so that's
just them trying to like trying to
protect themselves on the back end
because obviously they're gonna profit
from this and if there is some sort of
SEC investigation or something like that
that's probably just this was all just a
joke we just you know we were just
joking around guys we couldn't help that
it affected AMD stock price or anything
like that
CTS reserves the right to refrain from
updating this website even as it becomes
outdated or inaccurate so they have like
we have no obligations like correct
anything here if it actually turns out
to be wrong or something like this just
like people can just keep referencing
this total journalism ation
yeah
now if you do wants to read an article
that's a little bit more geared towards
the vulnerable
themselves there's an article from Ars
Technica also linked in the description
this is by Dan Gooden and I've
appreciated a lot of his work that he's
done in writing write-ups in the in the
IT security space that kind of thing
because it's an area that I'm definitely
not super well-versed in myself so check
this out again fairly liked not I feel
like the art the title is a little raft
of flaws makes bad hacks much much much
worse so anyway the form a there's
there's a bunch of dangerous in these
four flaws the the flaws themselves are
called master key rise and fall fallout
and chimera the dangers include running
persistent malware inside the AMD secure
processor that is impossible or nearly
impossible to detect by passing advanced
protections such as an D secure
encrypted virtualization firmware
trusted platform module and others
security features which are intended to
secure systems and sensitive data in the
event that malware infects a computer's
operating system stealing credentials a
vulnerable computer uses to access
networks and physically destroying
Hardware by attackers and hardware based
ransomware scenarios so there are some
legitimate flaws here to be worried
about but we need to wait until we get
some more professionals to look into it
we need to wait until AMD has had some
time to look into it and hopefully this
act by this company and whoever the
people are behind it isn't so reckless
to the point that today there's anyone
who's actually able to take advantage of
these exploits in to some negative
effects to people who are using any of
this affected hardware before patches or
other fixes can be made available
it does seem serious and they to the
extent that potential exploits could
persist beyond like operating system
wipes and that kind of thing and also
the possibility of losing data or as it
says physically destroying Hardware I'm
not exactly sure how how that works
these are these are potential issues
with these are have these are these are
dangers of these flaws so yes if if a
master hacker with all of the right
tools had administrator access to your
system these are the
simple things that they might be able to
do to your assistant well what if I want
them to do a clean install of Windows
for me no no I'm saying I'm saying if
you had an affected system the wipe of
Windows would not necessarily fix it
which also potentially as has the issue
of like system integrator like a shady
system integrator or something like that
he uses these exploits to somehow I
don't know something like see I'm
getting into speculation myself which I
don't want to do all right Andy
published a brief statement earlier
today titled the view from our corner of
the street I don't know what that means
today they said they just received a
report from a company called CTS labs
claiming their potential security
vulnerabilities related to certain of
our processors we were actively
investigating and analyzing the findings
company was previously unknown to AMD we
find it unusual for a security firm to
publish its research to the press
without providing a reasonable amount of
time for the company to investigate an
address its findings at AMD security is
top priority and working to trigger
safety in elisa so yeah I just super
sketchy more on this I'm sure to come so
we'll probably maybe look back and talk
a little bit more about it next week on
the show that's pretty much all we had
to say about it for right now typical
examples people trying to take advantage
of other others for for a profit yeah
it's kind of good and yeah again like I
said that reddit thread quite a few
links on there to various people who
have commented on it in in the IT
security world okay moving on to the
GeForce partner program bump bump
Nvidia so this article is over on hard
OCP this was a actually from the founder
owner of hard row CP Kyle Bennett and he
wrote up this article based on a
significant amount of research according
to what he has written here about what
is being called the GeForce Partner
Program which is a program from Nvidia
it's not a partner program as in you the
partner the consumer who buys the
graphics card it's a partner program as
an Nvidia who makes the GPUs and the
partners as
the three parties who make Edun boards
adding cards who take their gpus such as
ASIS or msi or gigabytes or EVGA or
ZOTAC or we're soon to be answer or lots
of others discussed later probably not
but we will well dispel that rumor too
now the article itself is is pretty I
mean it's it's discussing how it impacts
consumer choice and how this partner
program if it's implemented when we're
not sure like there's there's really not
been much from Nvidia on this they have
some boilerplate statements they
actually based on Kyle reaching out to
them about the story he was writing
Nvidia preemptively posted a blog post
about the GeForce partner program that's
on the Nvidia website and the video blog
so that has sort of their take on it but
it's it's very it's very generic it's
it's not it's it's I'm sure there is
further addressing of this that we're
hoping we're gonna get at some point
assuming people keep digging on it so it
should also be mentioned that this story
was originally presented to her Tokyo CP
by AMD AMD knew of this going on to
whatever degree I don't know how much
they knew about it and AMD was like oh
the public should know about this
granted AMD is and videos competitors so
AMD took the story and they went to
publications and said hey we know about
this this and this we can give you this
information about it if you're willing
to write it up and publish it on your
website this is not uncommon it's not
like all the time but this this happens
I will point out a time that Nvidia did
it back when we were at nuoc and we were
doing new itv and NVIDIA working with
like PC perspective this is when the
framerate capture and analysis custom
stuff came out and NVIDIA discovered
through FCAT testing that the AMD
graphics cards at the time weren't doing
very well when it comes to like the 1%
load they were having some stuttering
issues and stuff like that and if you
did FCAT testing this new testing method
which is different than the FPS like
average FPS method that have been used
for a lot of the time it meant that you
could clearly show Nvidia cards in a
better light
it's so Nvidia with this information
started going to other people and saying
like hey you guys over at no egg TV
would you be interested in doing some
coverage on this again that's like you
might look at that as like that shady or
whatever but it's not that uncommon and
it's and and they're not forcing anyone
to do it and they are certainly not
trying to give anyone an deccan they're
not paying people off to do anything
like this yeah this is all just sort of
like full disclosure type stuff that's
put out there so that the writer of the
article can be like alright this
originally came to me from Andy but Kyle
said originally they weren't even going
to take it up but he started
investigating it a little bit more and
according to him spent about the last
three weeks talking to different OEMs
and ad and board vendors in the industry
that do business with NVIDIA and a large
scale he talked to seven different
companies reps from seven different
companies he said not one of the seven
would talk to us on record if they spoke
to us about it at all the ones that did
speak to us have done so anonymously in
fear of losing their jobs or retribution
from their companies or directly from
Nvidia the crux of the issue with NVIDIA
GPP comes down to a single requirement
in order to be part of GPP in order to
have access to the GPB program its
partners much must have its gaming brand
aligned exclusively with GeForce what
does that mean so I'm gonna use a Zeus
as an example here because they're the
best example because they work with AMD
and NVIDIA and they have a gaming brand
if you buy an Asus graphics card you
might just buy an Asus graphics card and
you can buy their very generic Asus GTX
1080 I forget what they call it or
whatever you can buy an Asus graphics
card and then you can buy an asus rog
graphics card rog republic of gamers is
the Asus gaming brand it is a sub brand
it's part of Asus and it specifically
just Republic of gamers the the gigabyte
equivalent would be like Horus now most
companies are at least a lot of the
companies in the space have some sub
brand that specifically says gaming and
there is some marketing magic to the
word gaming
for some reason it's been known and
established in the industry for very
very long time make this graphics card
gtx 980ti
rog Strix whatever it will sell this
amount this whatever gtx 980ti RG Strix
gaming graphics card will sell this
amount like it's always more you put the
word gaming there it's always going to
be more so there appears to me to be
still some some uncertainty with NVIDIA
sexual requirements for the gaming like
does that mean that Asus is gonna need
to create another like alright let's
assume we don't know for sure if anyone
has agreed to be part of this program or
whatever let's assume asus has decided
yes we want to sign up for this geforce
partner program with rog now there are
no more
AMD rog asus graphics cards so right now
for instance you can buy an asus strix
rog gtx 980ti or a Vega 64 you can get
either one they look very similar they
use the same design and everything like
that
Asus would have to I assume create a
different sub brand now for AMD cards
would they be able to use the word
gaming with that like I don't know and
I'm not sure if that's part of the
requirements or not or Asus would just
have to not have the AMD graphics cards
that they make again assuming they were
part of the GeForce partner program they
would have to make those graphics cards
not tagged as ROG right they would just
be the Asus GTX 1080i awesome there I'm
sorry the Asus Radeon Vega 64 awesome
version and again I am not sure if they
are trying to specifically say that you
your sub brand whatever whatever other
brand that's not affiliated or not
associated with the NVIDIA gaming sub
brand that you have like can't use that
gaming term as well III don't know and
honestly that might be an important
factor with this if NVIDIA is just
trying to look for further segmentation
in the sub brands that the kind of the
companies that they work with that do
add in boards then that doesn't seem all
that nefarious to me yes it is slightly
pushy and NVIDIA isn't a very
they're there in the very dominant
position in the market right now but
trying to be like alright ASIS we don't
want our G and D cards anymore but you
can make your AMD sub brand you know
your what do you go
Radeon gaming group I don't know
whatever whatever you want to call it
again there's some argument there if
they're saying like Asus if you want to
sign up with geforce partner program you
cannot call any other graphics cards you
sell from any other GPU manufacturers
gaming then that's a little bit more
heavy-handed in my personal opinion um
the article really so there there's
there's a precedent for this in the
industry Intel has been accused of and
indeed has been forced to pay fines both
in the US and the EU for their
anti-competitive practices in the past
this has been documented extensively
there are a wide range of opinions about
Intel from those who have looked deeply
into the Intel partner program they did
back in the day some people I've talked
to swear off Intel completely because of
these practices others are like you know
it it's it's a competitive industry and
companies are going to do whatever they
can get away with to make more money so
it's just part of the game and I don't
know I don't know exactly where I stand
on that spectrum but the point is
anti-competitive practices are bad for
the consumer that there's no denying or
arguing that if you are given less
choice
if there are less options for you then
you might have not have as much price
competitiveness so you might have to pay
more for products so ultimately is what
NVIDIA is doing here going to hurt us as
consumers and again here we're not 100%
sure of the answer yet I'm not sure if
this is gonna be the type of thing that
people discussed for a while and then
kind of just goes by the wayside and
then the g4s partner program exists and
people stop caring about it if it's just
gonna be one of those festering things
people complain about every so often
core if there's gonna be enough pushback
right now based on this article and
other stuff that has come out the people
are gonna be like no Nvidia that's not
right you shouldn't do that and you suck
now and in videos like all right
well we'll back up on that or change the
terms or try or something like that I
feel I feel like I have to believe that
it would impact consumers in a
meaningful way to some degree because
let's say you want an AMD card you want
an RX Vega card but if asus is forbidden
to make an rog version of one of those
cards then maybe that card doesn't have
the same amount of engineering or R&amp;amp;D or
attention and care as their
cream-of-the-crop premium gaming brand
which is now in the hands of indian
nvidia right so I don't know it's it's
almost like if you really want to get
the best flagship card that Asus has on
hand it's got to be an ROG card and if
this is the sort of deal that they're
striking up with these partners then
you're not gonna be able to do that with
with team red necessarily I think it I
think it also hurts the the brand
obviously because ROG using that example
is a very well known very well
established and reputable sub brand and
and we'll all know the difference right
you will understand what's going on when
let's say this does go through and all
of a sudden there's this new sub brand
like you said you know Asus gaming with
Radeon rx Vega will know that's like
okay yeah that's like you know it's
still a decent GPU it's gonna run fine
but people who are just getting into pcs
or maybe don't know
you know the ins and outs like we do
necessarily might just reach for the ROG
first hand because that's like the more
popular brand it's the more
well-established brand and you know it's
it's gonna be stealing sales away from
me and Vita to a certain degree
simply because certain partners are
willing to align themselves more closely
with and that that's that's a good point
a lot of these even like you look at
Asus even the sub brands have had years
of marketing behind them and when you do
marketing when you brand something like
that takes a lot of work that takes a
lot of time it often takes a lot of
money to establish a brand to
give the impression for people that
might be buying it this certain idea of
what that brand is like establishing
that in people's minds it's a pretty
important task for anyone who does
marketing to do especially for something
like you know like an asus rog brand so
that's a very good point that suddenly
AMD not being able to be part of that
with their Radeon graphics cards you
know it might be more of a significant
hit with some of these some of the
companies they work with than others
now we haven't even pointed out very
specifically what happened like what GPP
actually does right so if you decide to
become I'm sorry if you choose not to be
part of the GeForce Partner Program
according to Nvidia you lose the
benefits of GPP that includes high
effort engineering engagements early
tech engagement launch partner status
game bundling sales rebate programs
social media and PR support marketing
reports and perhaps most importantly
marketing development funds or MDF and
MDF is often used it's used for really
wide range of stuff but anytime you need
cash to pay for an events or something
like that that's in videos MDF and they
usually have usually have an amount of
that that they can I don't wanna I don't
want to make too many assumptions about
how their company works but MDF is money
that they use for marketing marketing
development funds that's why it's kind
of a generic term I believe MDF can also
be used to combat price drops too so if
you have like if so if you're like a
retailer and you bought a bunch of this
product from this company and then a
couple months go by and the products
value drops and the company is aware of
that and they've even dropped the price
that they're selling that product at
they might be able to credit you MDF so
that you can reduce the price of that
product to sell it in a more competitive
price anyway was I getting a thing so it
sucks to not have that and what I was
thinking of when when I first read about
this was like you know how every once in
a while you come across a graphics card
brand that you've never heard of and
you're just like they exist and make
graphics cards that seems like a fairly
difficult thing to manufacture and yet
I've never heard of this company
before right maybe it's a regional thing
or whatever but some brands just move a
very small amount of hardware and they
don't move them that they don't so they
don't get as many GPUs directly from
Nvidia and they're not able to sell as
many and it might just mean they're a
smaller company or it might just mean
they have other stuff that they do as
well and for some reason like what's
that's one that I that comes to mind
peel it yeah I mean they're more well
known I guess than like the super tiny
ones but like ones that you know you
wouldn't immediately come to mind yeah
you know 3d maybe you know 3d enough 3d
was pointed out and colorful colorful
from my understanding is huge in China
but I don't I'm not positive about that
colorful is an example I have one that I
that I heard of pretty late and in my
tech career PNY yeah that's it's another
one there anyway point being most
partners would probably want to be part
of the g4s partner program thanks to the
benefits that you get however most
partners are probably less interested in
this if it cuts them off from doing
business with AMD and AMD in particular
is probably not very happy about this if
it hurts their ability to work with a 10
board partners in order to create
products to sell to customers and of
course if this ends up hurting the
ability for customers to actually get a
hold of graphics cards I guess it would
just kind of be the same right cuz
that's that's a completely different
very hopeful that one day things will
get it's a completely different problem
we're hopeful all right cool let's move
on
right gem article here actually got some
articles to go over this one is from WCC
F Tech and there's some slides that have
been bouncing around the internets this
articles from Hasan this is maybe true
this is this falls into the rumor
category and we're going to go over some
of the rise in 2000 series CPUs AMD's
already announced these they've already
promised that they're going to launch in
April and they've released a bit of
information about them but there's a lot
more specifics here in the article this
slide in particular has a big old list
and this is actually a very similar
layout and design two slides that they
were using with the original rice and
launch which either means a it's legit
or B it's not legit because they just
used the old slides and replace stuff
I'm not sure could have easily been
emulated yeah but the surprise to me was
at the top CPU in this stack is a 2700 X
right not the 2800 X I'm not sure why
they made that choice if they are lining
at 2800 X to come out later down the
line or something like that who knows
but you've also got the APS have just
launched other than that there's just
four here 2700 X 2,700 2,600 X and 2600
ranging in price from two hundred
dollars up to three hundred and seventy
dollars and if you're an overclocker
than the 2700 and 2600 are probably your
best bets because you know you can
overclock those and save yourself 70
bucks or 50 bucks depending on where you
going with that the 2700 X which is at
the top of the stack is a 8 core 16
thread processor with 3.7 gigahertz base
clock and 4.3 5 gigahertz boost clock
it's not quite hitting that 4.5 the
people were we're hoping for but 4.35 as
a promised boost is not that bad and we
can hopefully hope that there would also
be further maybe a little bit
overclocking Headroom beyond that maybe
if you're looking at the speeds of the
last generation of Verizon or the first
generation of rajin I guess I should say
you might expect the one or two hundred
megahertz boost over that give or take
but I'm sure hopefully we'll see once
the presses actually come up it's got a
slightly higher TDP at 105 watts
compared to the 95 watt TDP of the first
gen 20 Meg's cache 16 PCI Express Lanes
supports 29 and 33 megahertz ddr4 which
is very nice I don't know if that's if
that's the base frequency that's that's
that's a that's a good starting off
frequency there and it ships with a
wreath prism cooler you've also got the
2,700 2,600 X and 2,600 all listed there
again the articles link in the
description if you guys want to check
out any of the details on those I like
the 8 core 16 thread 2,700
for 300 bucks seems reasonable and the
six core are twelve three at 2600 is
only a hundred and ninety-nine dollars
that's pretty cool too there is a chart
further down here that has them all
listed out so here you can see their
boost clocks like the 2700 X 4.35 2700
is 4.1 2600 X is 4.25 so you do get a
nice boost in the boost clock going from
the 2,600 2,600 X but these are all of
course gonna be unlocked for
overclocking as well so if you're an
overclocker you can go ahead and do that
very mine the none of these have
graphics integrated into them and
they're all based on Zen Plus which is a
slight refinement of the originals and
architecture and it's on the 12
nanometer manufacturing process which
might I was gonna say might might lend a
bit of efficiency but the trade-off and
efficiency was offset by the increased
clock speeds which was why they
eventually decided 105 watt TDP was the
way to go I do want to point out that
the lower clocked 2700 has a 65 watt TDP
so you can still get by with a like a
passive cooler or something something
that's lower powered if you're in that
kind of situation now there's also going
to be new motherboards with these these
have also already been talked about by
AMD but there's a little bit more
information on them now all this stuff
is expected to launch April 19th and the
motherboards at least one of the upgrade
reasons so like these are going to be
backwards compatible with be 350 and X
370 motherboards the new motherboards
are be 450 and x4 70
and the reason you might want one of the
newer motherboards
is to enable precision boost overdrive
right that's the the caching drive
feature right this is actually a it's
it's it's a temperature based precision
boost so it will I think so if you put a
good cooler on it then it will it will
amp up your boost clock even beyond I
assume the 4.25 or whatever whatever
that I'm sorry 4.4.3 5 now 4.25 4 by 35
I'm still memorizing this stuff so might
go up higher than four point three five
gigahertz if you have a better cooler
installed on there that's precision
boost overdrive and they also have XFR
to enhanced mode which is from my
understanding like it just at maintains
higher clock speeds a little bit longer
that's that's my understanding I I need
to read up a little bit more on this as
well which I wasn't willing to do just
in case these slides aren't legit but
they look fairly legit my experience but
again miss all might just be rumor and
untrue okay let's talk about one last
story which is uh possibly like at first
I read about it I was like oh maybe
that's good news which was the rumor
that asrock might be making graphics
cards as rock makes motherboards and
they do other stuff too but they've
never really made graphics cards and a
digi Times article from last week which
has now gone behind a paywall
is rumored that they might actually make
GPUs discrete GPUs Tom's Hardware I went
and dug into a little bit more Igor
Wallace Eck asked around the industry a
little bit didn't get any information
directly from asrock but based on his
discussions with some other people he
says is it's sort of true not true but
just sort of true all the competitors he
talked to kept mentioning MXM which is
the short hand for mobile piece PCI
Express module so according to this
article the conjecture is that as rack
has made a deal with AMD and wants to
enter the market for MX and MXM modules
Nvidia for their part has not announced
any specific MXM modules with Nvidia
graphics processors but AMD has and
maybe asrock wants to manufacture them
is that one of their boards this board
here that say this is an MXF module this
board here is their h1 10s
XM XM and this is actually a STX board
which is smaller than Mini ITX
and you can see it as an MX M module
right there these modules are made to
very specific specifications and I guess
there's not a lot of wiggle room with
the design of them so they wouldn't be
too terribly difficult for asrock to
manufacture but by manufacturing
themselves they might be able to save a
little bit of money and perhaps for
small form-factor implementations or
proprietary designs that kind of thing
they may be able to combine that with
their motherboard manufacturing know-how
to create some unique products so XM
didn't exist before this it did oh it's
it's a it's a standard it's a PCI
Express mobile stock okay I've never
really heard about much
yeah it's because likes like slotted
graphics cards they're just only so much
they can do
they're very limiting and so you know
they there have been a couple attempts
in the past at producing like a laptop
chassis that's a frame that you can like
buy parts for and kind of do a DIY
laptop but it's never really taken off
simply because the the the the
everything's too small it's difficult to
work with like the ribbon cables and
stuff like that are very delicate and a
lot easier to damage and there's just
not enough interest to establish that
market so but all that said MXM is a PCI
Express standard that has made it much
easier for manufacturers to take and
establish salaat design and you know
have two or three different GPU possibly
you know possible GPU options that they
can install there so okay interesting so
don't be hoping for a bunch of asrock
discrete cards coming out anytime soon
but maybe some interesting mini PC
asrock products I'm only interested if
one of those can outperform one other
the new rise in AP use then I might it
probably would I mean it I would piqued
my interest
it said this it's a discrete option that
can have its own dedicated memory
dedicated memory is pretty huge
from the jump from integrated to above
that were those slots on that board
yeah this board has som slots yeah so
pretty
so that is tiny each one Centon each one
10 chipset little socket so is it using
the same is it using the same standoff
mounts as a mini ITX then why do you
think these indicate these two are
probably the I believe I think it's a 4
inch gap actually no it looks like a
completely different layout because this
has 6 this has 6 mounting points and
it's rectangular not square more
rectangular and square now they're not
wrong and this is actually larger no
it's still very small that is low it's
really tiny yeah anyway who knows so
there you go a little bit more on the as
erotic situation ok and guys that is
pretty much all that I have so far today
for prepared materials I really just
wanted to hit those those news topics
and try to get dig into them as much as
I could without overstepping my
knowledge look alright so let's switch
over and do some Q&amp;amp;A ok
we've had a few people who have made
donations thank you guys for doing that
our first question is from Scott Dilbeck
20 bucks Scott hey thanks Paul watch an
old awesome hardware episodes we have
the same brent Spiner Spiner deer data
signed photo brent brent Spiner yes it's
better that brent Spiner deer data
signed photo fist-bump Kyle saw that out
of your weapon in recent video what is
it and do you like it wow thanks for
noticing yes it is an Audi
it's the rs3 and I love it so far it's a
huge upgrade from my hyundai elantra
2006 I'm so glad Kyle got a new car it
was quite the eyesore I can go places
with him and not fear for my life
yeah the moment I knew I needed a new
car is when we were actually at a name I
think it was an AMD event in Los Angeles
not too long ago oh yeah and we were
waiting for I was waiting for my car for
valet to bring me my car cuz the vet was
over I was out there in the front hall
and I think Paul might might have taken
off or maybe he was still there but it
took me like 15 minutes for my car to
show up and I was like
what is taking so long the guy had to
jump my car in the valet parking lot
because it wouldn't start and that
wasn't the first time that had happened
either so I'm really happy with least he
was able to jumpstart it I know thank
God that would've been really
embarrassing before like Jay walked out
or something Jay from AMD not toms brems
MIT sound 100 Norwegian Crona yeah
finally back the donations going through
going some rough going some rough time
from Beijing Oh being beginning of sorry
the typos here at beginning of 2018
sucked yeah Paul I understand you we
were in the same place you were at but I
can tell but I can tell one after 2nd
try all disappears PS waiting HTTP e
HCPCS though I've got a slide that one
in the end there
Oh Kevin and yes thank you very much
Tom's we we have we've had we've had
positive news we have the go-ahead for a
second attempt nice awesome so cool
that's great all right
does Jones five bucks are you all
looking forward to benching Zen plus
risin fives and seven CPUs and X 470
motherboard chipsets looking forward I
mean I just don't want to be overwhelmed
like I was last year I'm always torn yes
I know overwhelmed with so many cpu
launches just lunches in general the
only CPUs though Rison coming out of
nowhere like we haven't seen that kind
of release like from either Intel or AMD
in years yeah yeah yeah which is so I
don't know I'm excited and also can I'm
looking forward to it but yeah also some
slight apprehension just because we know
there's gonna be a decent amount of work
but I think I think it's good AMD has
given a pretty decent amount of time the
past couple launches to to get stuff in
order and since the platform has been
out for a little while longer
hopefully there'll be fewer quirks I
guess yeah so cool GPS to you $5
suggestions need to be Oh sir I never I
know I have you're right you're okay
suggestions open-back headphones into
deck under $200 maybe 250
recommendations looking at sennheiser
598 SRS and a 508 10k on Amazon Prime
that's a pretty good combo for the deck
I'd check out Mayflower I mean our
electronics they have a range of those
they're all under 200 I believe and I've
had a good experience with them yep
I like the Sennheiser 958 598 sorry
those are really nice I actually almost
got those several years back but I opted
for the beyerdynamic instead but I'm
sure I would have been happy either yeah
you can't go wrong with Sennheiser Dez
Jones 10 dollars people are ripping off
consumers on eBay seven to eight hundred
dollars furry fricking that for the win
GTX 1080 so I asked a guy hey would you
take 580 cuz 800 I was 1080i territory
and the dude replied with a lol message
and I was like WTF I'm sorry does I know
we all know and it sucks for everyone
right now I'm gonna suck and I wish we
had better answers to give to people
yeah it's like man there's anyone who
already has a graphics card that's like
the only that's the only good that has
come out of this situation is people who
bought a 1080 T I like a year and a half
ago it's like you finally have a
situation where I bought the best
graphics card when it came out of a
consult for even many year and a half
later it's still the best graphics card
nothing has come out that's like better
yeah I wasn't I'm not talking about cash
it's not about the money Kyle I'm just I
thought that's something that's also a
it's a it's about it's about it's about
the constant like PC Building conundrum
of like whatever you get is gonna have
something faster better come out you
know in a week or a month or whatever
but man 1080 TI owners like that's
getting it's got some long legs and a
long legs out of that beam I mean it's
not it's like Nvidia could have come out
with something better they just didn't
need to there's no competition so yeah
yeah dollars sup fellas finally hit 807
day Congrats Congrats T that's him
so I'm cracking open a nice cold Hef
from Drake's brewing to celebrate cheese
from El Jefe cheers to you sir awesome
dude congratulations
bazinga X 5 bucks what's up with Kyle
he's too mellow wifey sauce make him
sleep
the sofa good theory you tired solid
theory I am very tired this whole like
this weekend last week I've been so so
so wiped out you're conserving your
energy for your half of the show right
yes yes exactly that's that's right okay
thank you
reed Johnson maybe five bucks love the
show you guys are awesome we love you
too you're all sad and roush wired and
revived kanay vs hey guys what would be
a Quadro em five-thousand equivalent in
both P Series and GTX I have found one
used and wondering if $1,200 or 1200
Canadian is worth it Quadra Andrew I am
not comfortable answering that question
because I'm very uncomfortable because I
haven't looked at that directly first
off
Quadra I'm 5,000 and is going to be very
good for you or very bad for you
depending on the software that you're
planning on using it for if you're using
professional-grade software that is that
works with the quadruped team then
that's probably a good a good option so
definitely check the specific software
you're planning and use and using and
seeing if you see if you can find
benchmarks of that specifically and then
beyond that the reason I hesitate to
give you any advice when it comes to
pricing is I'm actually not positive if
the Quadro cards have been affected by
the GPU pricing situation I haven't even
looked at that so I don't know like
buying a 1080 for nine hundred dollars
compared to a Quadro for twelve hundred
it might just be a local obviously get
the Quadro but I don't know if Quadros
are overpriced too so but yeah make it
make it do your research focused on what
you're planning on doing with the cards
so look up benchmarks on the software
that you're intending to use and make
your choice based on that yep sorry I
can't give you further advice than that
but from cell hey with no donation the
hell sale so I'm just kidding settle
down donate money cells are moderator
thank you for being here cell and he
does a great job he's awesome he says
both streams are lagging a bit and audio
is fine but the video has a bit of chop
might be the 60fps I'm not sure it could
be it's probably your first time using
the razor ripsaw oh yeah I got the rip
stop
all right Nate penny with $10 donation
currently using an AMD FX 8350 aid do I
upgrade to the first gen rise in 1600 X
since they'll be going down in price or
wait for the new Verizon Plus CPUs Nate
at this point I would definitely say at
least hold off a month we're looking at
about a month now till mid-april when
they lot on the launch happens typically
you're gonna see a reduction in price of
last gen or possibly getting more
performance for the same price with the
next gen that would be my guest in
either situation so you're probably be
in a better spot at that point and at
that and then it's just gonna be a
matter of how much money you're willing
to spend if saving a few bucks on the
last gen is worth it for you based on
the benchmarks that come up but yeah
definitely you're gonna see a huge
improvement coming from your 80 a320
either way that you go hell yeah
pup shepherd with the $10 donation he
said just open stream did you do mail
time not yet that'll be on my half the
show you didn't Kyle's gonna do meal
time I do have the mail though
okay got it so I'm selling I'm probably
gonna do mail time from from my appeal
bucks next week because I didn't pick up
today Thank You pup Phil Phillip vector
$5 nation hey would you please let
Jessica aka Claire mysterium that cow
that guys that the guy laying on the bed
behind her hopes you have a better day
going forward please okay
how there I don't know how we do that
how do we contact Claire who's Claire
mysterion's I'm just so confused is this
like a VIP is that a is that a
personality or something I don't think
I'm very confused I'm very confused
Philip I don't know what to do right now
but we'll let Jessica know just get on
the bed behind you selves you have a
better sell said she watches the stream
ah okay whoa good all right well I hope
she's gotten the message then no Jessica
the guy laying on the bed behind you
hopes you have a better
and also if you weren't expecting a guy
on a bed behind you then call the police
yes most important but do it subtly yeah
he can't know hopefully you're wearing
earbuds and we didn't just blow your
cover through the speakers yeah rip
speaker users okay
that said we're homeless ready to switch
over to cows half real quick though
we're gonna just reach out some Johnson
shout outs for people who have ordered
from our stores on the show many thanks
