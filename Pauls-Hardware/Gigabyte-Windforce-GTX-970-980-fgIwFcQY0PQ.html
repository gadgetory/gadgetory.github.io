cards from gigabyte to their custom gtx
970 and gtx 980 both with the wind force
cooler both of these cards are based on
versions of invidious GM 204 GPU a new
5.2 billion transistors chip that's
built on an updated version of the
Maxwell architecture with the 900 series
thus far you get support for Nvidia's
new technologies dynamic super
resolution technology MFA and VX GI but
one of my favorites is the reduced power
consumption the 980 has a TDP of just
165 watts so compare that to a GTX 780
for example which has a 250 watt TDP the
970 s TDP is just 145 watts now these
cards may physically look the same but
just pick them up and you'll notice the
980 is significantly heavier that's
because the wind force cooler on the 980
is beefed up with triangle cool
technology a block of aluminum at the
center that kind of angles air flow away
from the center of the cards a huge
copper plate over the GPU and
surrounding components and a special
aluminum thin stack that is quite dense
and has varied height to produce air
turbulence which helps with cooling you
also have five eight millimeter copper
heat pipes and three specialized 11
blade fans designed to channel air down
towards the heat sinks more efficiently
all of this plus two eight pin PCI
Express power connectors that's versus
the two six pin connectors on the
reference design allows gigabyte to ship
the card with the GPU overclocked to
1228 megahertz base clock and 1329
megahertz boost the four gigabytes of
256 bit gddr5 memory is clocked at seven
gigahertz the wind force GTX 970 might
be lighter but it still has a beefy
cooler with four six millimeter copper
heat pipes three separate luminance tax
and the same attractive black metal
shroud around the three fans
it also comes factory overclock with a
1178 megahertz base and a 1329 megahertz
boost very respectable and the GTX 970
sports 1006
and 64 CUDA cores one of the main
differences between it and the 980 which
has 2048 you've also got increased power
delivery with a 6 pin and an 8 pin
required gigabyte beefed up the video
outputs on their 970 making them
identical to the 980 which is cool
because 3 DisplayPort outs means you can
do surround g-sync gaming gigabyte also
has something called flex display which
is supposed to help out here as well but
honestly I do not fully grasp what it is
supposed to do anyway I'd have to say I
like the look of both of these cards in
particular I like that gigabyte folded
the metal flap with the wind force logo
up for recent versions and that the logo
now also has a cool blue LED backlight
when the card is powered on both of the
cards also have matching black metal
back plates with the gigabyte gaming eye
logo and a pretty aggressive look I only
had these cards for a short while before
I had to return them so sorry this is
just a quick overview guys I will be
doing some testing on the 900 series
soon on at least the 970 but let me know
in the comments what you think of these
cards and what 9 70s and 9 80s from any
of invidious board partners you've seen
that have caught your interest and I
will see what I can get a hold of like
and share this video if you please and
as always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
