after-party
we will after-party is linked in the
description by the way now oh jeez it's
the gamers next oh so high she scared
him is thought it was Jesus that's tech
Jesus close alright getting back to the
matter at hand I am unprepared no I am
but you have copious notes I do know I
don't have any zero notes you usually
have notes so I can say things and I
know about these things that are talking
about obviously did you read the
articles do you get a chance to read
I've read them I familiar with ok that's
hot well you're much better at absorbing
information than I am
I'll do my best I'll read something in
like five seconds later be like what did
I just read forget literally everything
and that's easy enough to do you're like
a sponge no no all right
topic number one for today's show is the
radion 7 mm hmm look I have one mm-hmm
do you do an unboxing no no didn't do it
unboxing okay boxing's are for suckers
you get roped in by the companies trying
to get more coverage on their products
so like here's an unboxing embargo so
that you will be suckered into watching
no a boxing videos actually usually get
more hits than actually do it sucks it's
because it's the first video like kill
it like it's all the hype is leading up
to the first video that everyone posts
but once that first video goes out even
if it's just an unboxing it kind of
kills some of the hype
no one's gonna follow up with the second
video like a sodden box why would I want
to watch
video where they test it and do
benchmarks and all that stuff anyway so
I didn't I didn't get one out of three
out of seven as well quite a few people
in media have published unboxing videos
and otherwise recently I was watching
the gamers Nexus video because they also
did a teardown you know they're bold
like that I appreciate that
Steve took it apart given a little bit
more context a little bit more
information as far as what because you
know also there's restrictions on
reviewers and why what you're able to
talk about so far so on the plus side it
was easier to take apart than invidious
recent founders edition offerings
oh geez here oh that's that's not scary
at all
comforting sound also there's a graphite
thermal pad that's on here it's a
specific one if I had notes I would tell
you exactly what it is it but I didn't
anyway point being it's there to provide
some more more better coverage for all
the stuff that's going on here which is
not just the GPU itself but also the HBM
to memory stacks since it gets 16 gigs
of HP on to memory in the past there
have been height variances between the
different different ICS that are on the
substrate material there and when you
have height differences and you have a
heatsink going on top of them that's
supposed to provide a universal or a
uniform flat contact for those the
height difference can lead to issues
when it comes to cooling so that might
be one reason why this graphite thermal
pad has been used it also you know it
has conductivity that's about on par
with with your thumb with your high
quality thermal paste but just an
interesting aspect of the actual
construction of this particular card you
know the the PCB itself also seems to be
well designed with with high quality
vrm delivery components and and all that
kind of good stuff
lots of copper there and on the heat
sink fan the outside as well you know
copper is conductive
and there's a closer look at the actual
dye or the the package that has the GPU
dye in the middle and the 4 4 gig HP m2
memory stacks on the sides beyond that
there was a bunch of other unboxings
like jay jay did an unboxing hard OCP
did an unboxing kit crew did an unboxing
there's me l did an unboxing best lemme
lemme yeah you're you're shooting it
like a gun i was i was happy with that
you know I worked at we're dead it
matches with the title you know I'm kind
of noisy you have two hundred and eighty
seven thousand views so you can't
complain yeah you know I watched your
video doing okay you know probably the
worst unboxing I've ever done like I
felt like you could easily use Jays
title you're my unboxing and it still
would have fit it was was better than it
was flogged style which was you can get
away with a lot when you do the blog
style yeah it's very unforgiving the
vlog format may need lots of forgiveness
February 7th or Thursday is when this
actually goes up for sale for six
hundred and ninety-nine dollars u.s.
there is no official word on when
reviews can go live but presumably some
repairs up for sale reviews go live that
that usually is when you guys know the
drill look looking forward Thursday if
you want more info on that weird
following up Apple did you hear about
the FaceTime bug no you have any family
room no nope how many family members he
use FaceTime bug
what's an apple is that a fruit Apple is
company iPhones okay any faced him had
this kind of crazy bug it was a it'll
like if he called someone and then you
add on using FaceTime and then you add
someone to the call then it would
automatically join the person who you
attempted to call as well and then you
could hear what they were saying without
them ever having to click accept
we pretty big bug in the actual FaceTime
software
Apple Apple that you can look at it two
ways
this started to blow up on social media
Apple was quick to go and disable it so
people couldn't use it anymore and I
don't know if I assume it's been patched
by now but also this kid was attempting
to report it for a while tried
contacting contacting Apple for ten days
this was after testing the bug for about
30 minutes and telling his mom about it
so on the plus side looking at the
silver lining to this thing for anyone
who you know uses an Apple device that
has FaceTime and his Vollmer was
vulnerable to this bug they are giving
the teen the reward his name what was
his name grant Thompson it's getting it
he's getting it doesn't say exactly up
to two hundred thousand dollars
Wow up to I don't know I don't know what
they're actually giving him but um but
there you go Apple following through
this keep being the first one to report
this pretty substantial bug in FaceTime
damn sweet look a gun Huawei Huawei
Huawei has there's an interesting story
about hallway they've been under the
microscope a bit from the US perspective
for breaches of security right um
there's a lot of like US government
organizations don't allow you to use
Huawei phones and everything like that
this is sort of a side to that but
Dimond glass is is a is a material
that's being developed to be used in
smartphones scratch-proof according
according to what they say here looks
like an ordinary piece of glass minutes
and it's transparent but it's actually
scratch proof the company that's
developing this and they've
representative is named Adam Khan who
they talk to is called a con a con a con
semiconductor Incorporated basically
what way
heard about this like hey why don't you
send us over a sample of that and they
were supposed to get the sample and have
it for a brief period of time and then
return it to the makan
they didn't they kept it for like five
months they apparently shipped it back
to China and they'll select broke it so
they were they were pretty clearly at
something to like reverse-engineer right
this diamond glass technology schedule
which is which is pretty sketchy and in
order to follow up on this they actually
the the US Department of Justice I
believe worked with them to negotiate us
there to set up a sting at CES what yeah
her as I froze at a burger joint and a
burger joint no way yeah so the FBI I'm
sorry the FBI did a sting on hallway at
a burger joint no one was actually
arrested but the CEO I believe the CEO
of the akan company was like wore a wire
and stuff like that were they expecting
to go down like like they they were just
they were just they were gathering
information they were gathering
information aha
and it was enough that you know hallway
has now been wait wait now I thought
there was a charge of a nut or something
like that maybe not directly so it was
just Kwame employees at the at the
burger place they weren't talking with
anyone else they were just like there
was like a spy in there listening to a
huawei employee conversation about the
diamond glass so you're asking me for
more details if I had probably it
doesn't really matter honestly but it's
always been under a lot of heat for
other things too yeah lately right like
this is just tip the iceberg for them
yeah so they like their CFO was arrested
recently for stealing trade secrets
they've been accused for stealing
remember she was in Canada CFO was
recently in Canada and then got arrested
in Canada and now she wants to get like
near the US wants to extradite her to
the United States here he is you know I
did but but since we're broadcasting to
people and we're being recorded right
now I hesitate to dive into details of
that without
without them being confirmed like in
text in front of me so we'll leave it to
the viewers at home if you'd like to
click on the links in the description
with the articles that have more
information on this
I do feel free to do so I did read the
article this morning but I just I
purposely didn't talk about it because a
little like this looks like a shitstorm
I don't want to get into like there was
just so much information like money
laundering something in that right you'd
rather not discuss without having fully
investigated so you can you know view
all sides and give a thorough
explanation of what's going on right I
just want to play Apex okay all right
let's move that's right okay let's play
Apex legends let's talk about that give
it to me
apex legends we already talked about
this briefly and cows half of the show
and just to be clear here we're not
being paid for this or anything like
that this was just something I kind of
woke up to today was that apex legends
had launched one thing I like about this
that's been pointed out by a few people
they didn't do like some open beta alpha
pretest thing or something like that
they just launched it it's like I don't
know where it's free-to-play it's based
on some existing an existing engine as
far as I know it's set in the titanfall
universe so they they have existing IP
you know it's something that's been in
development but they just sort of
dropped it on everyone this weekend and
said alright here it is it's
free-to-play it's open go ahead and
start playing he dropped it on it and
good titanfall pun exactly and like it
has been pretty stable from what I've
read people haven't had a lot of issues
with it so that at least is well done I
think from a development standpoint and
also kind of refreshing as sort of a
different means of launching a product
to like they're like here's the beta
whatever and the limited thing and then
all right now we're launching the game
but it's like there's five different
ways you can buy it so like if you
bought it this way you can play it this
week we've bought it this way you can
play it later this week but only for
five hours and if you bought it this way
you'd never actually get to play the
game you just get a stuffed animal
stuff like that you know anyway apex
legends available now send the titanfall
universe it is a battle royale style
game but it's it's sort of team-based
you you drop in and a team of three
there are twenty teams of three so with
60 60 people total right in each game
and there are eight different sort of
main character main characters like
heroes glasses and legends I believe as
they're called in the game that you can
play and they're gonna add more I think
in the future yeah each one has three
individual abilities one is passive one
is sort of a regular ability that you
can use normally that's not a cool-down
and one is like an ultimate ability so I
think kind of like like a hero
configuration like you might have an
overwatch it yeah sounds very kind of
the idea I get there at the same time if
you want to look at the dark raincloud
to the silver lining of the launch
titanfall and titanfall 2 or both games
that have that exist and titanfall 3 had
been in the works for a while titanfall
3 more recently has been said they
stopped development on potentially for
this yes it's that we're not really sure
of that because we don't know the inner
workings of the company but just prior
to this there was news that titanfall 3
wasn't being worked on but now that this
has launched we have news from IGN that
a premium titanfall experience is coming
later this year so if you had heard that
titanfall 3 was somehow cancelled or
something like that they're not
specifically saying titanfall 3 but a
premium titanfall experience means
probably a standalone not like a
free-to-play game like the Battle Royale
version that they just launched right
it's sort of on the horizon for that so
later this year that's obviously very
vague and everything so we're not
absolutely sure but it makes me think
that this was supposed to be titanfall 3
but then they wanted to hop on the
battle royale craze
so they Eurogamer reported that respawn
is not currently working on titanfall 3
this was from yesterday it's crazy to me
that like the highest-grossing game in
the world right now which is fortnight
is a free-to-play game and that like
everything's micro transaction based
well if you can make a game like it's a
game of style that a lot of people are
interested in yeah if you make that make
it free so you can have the cast as wide
a net as possible to get as many players
as possible right and then you know you
put in little ways for people you spend
3 bucks on this there's been you know
five bucks on this no one's like oh I
want that cape or whatever right to do
it and it's it seems to be a lucrative
business model for for the time being so
yeah yeah it's nuts uh yeah and then as
Kyle kind of mentioned on his half which
I forgot to click on the link for here
but yeah apex apex legends as well
that's where they broke they broke a
million unique players in under eight
within eight hours of launch which is
pretty impressive given again that it's
a game that they didn't really have any
early access to or open beta for or
anything like that like it was only kind
of rumored to be in development and
they're just kind of like here it's
crazy he'll play who's Vince Zampella
me lead I believe he's one of the
careers he's a CEO of respawn okay
okay make sense he looks very young to
be CEO of yeah he's doing well for
himself this picture imagine where he'll
be it bit well probably lightyears oh
yes alright so Kyle yes I have the
gaming PC losing has you have that game
so guys as I've already alluded to a few
times as we've started today's show
minimal preparation which means the
second half of my show before we even
get to the after party is going to be
gameplay yes we've loaded up apex
legends that's right you if you have
origin
it does use the origin launcher you can
you can just download it and play it for
free we have like zero experience with
this so this is gonna be is gonna be
very raw in your face
apex where's my first impressions right
yeah yeah right you see it's totally
dominate you have a headset back you
have a headset there's also something an
apex legend that's called a ping system
which is used for 2.2 like you can use
it to point to yeah you know something
that a teammate should pick up but you
can also use it to point out like a
enemy I guess something like that okay
throw these on there's there's no way I
can look at chat at the same time is
there yeah you know I'll just look at it
on your screen or something all right
legends play legends ooh
bloodhound Gibraltar lifeline paths
these are the various characters you can
play Oh two of them are locked so how do
I get those got a play for a while
probably let's try let's try Wraith
Wraith looks cool oh wait I can hear
myself talking shit but I can hear
myself echoing through somewhere so ah
shut up
also when you show your desktop everyone
see everything okay me yeah like right
now it's not a big deal but oh uh hi
desktop items just porn everywhere all
right here we go play play
play I can't this just go fullscreen
geez puppies oh boy your wife's home
probably probably are you doing I did
nothing the game crash it did what
system is this is the dynamic I'm
loading it up I didn't do anything you
just crashed out of nowhere game crash
dog barking if this if this crash once
again then I'll I'll just go home and
play Resident Evil yeah I thought I was
just keeping accolades on this game is
it's like very stable and everything oh
my gosh dogs dogs dogs dogs
doggone it dog damn it dog damn it
starting server maybe you're maybe it
wasn't your wife isn't there yeah they
probably just thought it was her why
can't
oh okay yeah actually joining a game now
are exciting okay here we go
select legend okay I thought I already
selected it I see you can see who else
is on there
gotcha awesome and you know like I
really hope that the people on my team
have already been playing this like is
the moment it came out and they're like
you know legendary and it'll carry me to
victory probably cuz I that's what I
would assume because I'm going to die so
quick so fast
introducing new champion introducing
I'm really glad that it's a battle
royale game that doesn't involve
building that building but there is
still the drop in you drop in oh yeah
you start with nothing and everything
I'm fine with looting I just I never
liked the building element okay the
building aspect of fortnight always
that's why you have to hotkey everything
yeah it's true
would you mind grabbing me one I'll take
a knife be a horse you don't mind thank
you loot loot loot loot the loot loot
loot loot loot okay play the video games
oh no oh no I think it crashed the game
crashed yeah I was running and then it
stopped no no everything stopped no I
was like I was so hyped up I got so
amped to like do some looting that sucks
what's going on here what's is that a
new PC this it could be the game very
well be the game yeah I mean I don't
think I don't think it's a PC it's a
9900 K&amp;amp;A oh they both need to be open
but that's the IP oh yeah
so now you KN an RT X 2080 in there
right now so yeah that doesn't sound
like the issue what oh hi Creason up
like that like the whole system just
locked up a driver is up to date as of
like 8 hours ago yeah 8 or 9 hours ago
was when I downloaded and update the
driver in this one is anything
overclocked or is everything bone stock
uh no I don't think anything's
overclocked if anything is overclock the
CPU might be a little bit but it
wouldn't I think that was like mild 4.8
gigahertz maybe well that's
disappointing well geez this games
broken no one no one player that's
totally not our fault that's unfortunate
white screen white screen of death
Wow my entire plan for my second half of
the shows just could you down the toilet
could you try it on oh it's not inside I
never downloaded it on this computer
it's only on that one right so all right
cool
is it is it worth trying to reboot while
we're here yeah give it a shot even shot
that's still shutting down for us that's
okay I just got the the razor edition of
that case yeah not too long ago I've
already done way too much coverage on it
so and I yeah I mean that's really the
exact same case with the Razer logo I
know I know I know
but it you know it makes me want to do
the Razer logo and kind of special
because it's like eh but it's etched
like inside the glass right yeah that's
pretty fancy looking yeah I do like
green builds a lot I'm gonna call it the
green machine original I know chock full
of ideas Paul's exciting
you'd have most of them for free let's
reopen origin all right what's what's
good okay hey-oh we could read off some
of the donation comments or Johnston's
well we could normally we do that we're
recently we have been doing that during
the after party but oh yeah true this is
supposed to be a pre after pray you're
right oops who don't stick around for
the after pray and aren't used to the
immense amount of excitement that goes
along with it oh really
why would it want that I've done that
already
because he rebooted maybe possibly it's
not still capturing this is it
no no I have that switched off for now
is it your oh my dog's is it this this
account for you yeah I'm not sure
actually work never see it
we'll see Dukey
I wonder why it crashed or why it's
crashing yeah that's like that sucks
hey I spent time downloading this and
getting this prepared before the show
started that I feel like nothing's been
working right this week yeah one of
those one of those weeks I can't say
Simon
case in point it's like the origin login
is literally so we're not functioning
nothing works
so broken the rest of the stream will be
troubleshooting trying to get one game
to run
covered up I got you I've got you back
cover me
that looked like it did something there
hey okay
success you know and we're calling
logging into origin of success then it's
gonna be a rocky road ahead impacts
legends super exciting uh morale is low
morale is low right now
I just just it's the calm before the
storm just chillin like villains oh yeah
did I ever get a reply for that
I did that play damn you what settings
are we at right now
can I see me now you what wait time can
they see my screen right now is okay you
want me well I mean that yeah they can
there's nothing sensitive at this point
I was just looking at some of my
settings resolutions at 7:20 can I talk
can these people hear me
is my mic plugged in hey slobby Rob I
like your name you can't hear me can't
hear me at all futile you are picking
third Oh interesting it lets you pick it
it randomizes the order that you can
pick your character so I picked last so
you're limited to like a tank of healer
in a teepee yes
like all around I just see that we have
three different icons here so that's
good but let's support shielding okay so
this is leaving my teammates one has
three kills already in the US 15
promising champion squad the hell are
these people it's gonna kick your ass
I'm jumpmaster I don't know what that
means but look the two people you're
with have vlg in front of the name that
means they're waiting know each other
I'm just suggesting all the locations
but they're not let's just line here see
and the jumpmaster he launched happens
right and we're to one and then we're
done you guide everywhere one person
decides okay yeah that could go really
well or keeping other people live what
is this guy saying
I think I led us into dangerous waters
other teams are diving in very dangerous
waters unfortunately you don't have a
mic because it's a way that the audio
had to be right now that's fine we'll
see what we can do okay
can you like open these doors oh yes the
people diving with you can break off and
yeah was this connait cool
I got again this again sir useful young
gun gun who's got the gun okay jeez
grenade guys the game we're playing
right now we're the Kyle's playing his
apex legends which just launched over
