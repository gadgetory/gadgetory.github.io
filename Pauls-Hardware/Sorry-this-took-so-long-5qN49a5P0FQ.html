I actually don't normally do a video
about this which is picking giveaway
winners but I hope you bear with me
because this week actually the past few
weeks has been a bit a bit crazy to say
the least but I had a 1 million
subscriber giveaway that's ended just
about two weeks ago I have not picked
the winners or announced them yet I'm
gonna do that right now today and I
thought I'd share the process with you
guys just to sort of explain things
maybe you've wondered in the past how
these giveaways actually work here's how
I do it at least and the number one
prize in this giveaway is this system
right here which I built in a previous
video so feel free to check that video
out if you want to see me put it all
together it has some pretty nice
hardware in there including a core i5
9600 k processor of course our hydro
h-60 almond liquid cooler asus rog Strix
ii 390 - i gaming mini ITX motherboard
so Kingston HyperX memory and our TX
2070 mini from gigabytes and Intel 660 P
one terabyte SSD Corsair small
form-factor 600 watt power supply and of
course the doctor's aber century 2.0
case the black version which is all
housed in super tiny and it's it's ready
to go so we need to pick a winner in
case you're wondering they're actually
going to be ten winners picked today and
if the winners don't actually get in
touch with me within about 24 hours of
this video going up and me notifying
them I will be picking new winners so
the winners that you see listed in this
video might not be the actual winners if
they are lazy and don't check their
email in time so I use gleam dot IO for
my giveaways and there's actually a
history a list of old giveaways here
going back almost three years I believe
Josh fractal Josh originally introduced
me to this website
the most recent giveaway is the 1
million subscriber Thank You giveaway
and you can see have not drawn the prize
winners for that yet this is the prize
list for it so not only is there this
century 2.0 gaming PC at the top but
there's some corsair components and
peripherals there's some inter max stuff
in there as well there's some NZXT stuff
and there's some Toshiba SSDs so I will
need to be choosing 10 winners here it
is right here and all I have to do is
click draw winners and it does the work
for me so here we go and now the moment
you've all been waiting for
and there are the winners we're gonna be
blurring some of this stuff out because
there are some personal information
there but you can see the the entry
number that they were whether they
entered towards the beginning of the
competition or towards the end and then
of course got their email address and
where the location was the location is
based on IP address so locations don't
always match up since this is an
international giveaway I have
international winners next step is going
to be over here and here I've made just
a Google Doc with the prizes listed out
and their links and everything and here
I'm just going to be marking down the
winner for each one in order as they
were drawn it just now then I will be
making an email and actually have a
couple forum emails that I've put
together in the past for notifying
winners because it's a little bit tricky
if you guys have ever won a giveaway
have you ever won a giveaway chances are
maybe you have it but you've probably
gotten lots of emails in the past that
say hey you want to give away and
they're probably scams and I'm always
aware of that so I try to make sure that
when I'm notifying winners I have all
the information possible that I can give
them as far as how they won then I
reference them to usually a tweet but
I'm actually gonna be referencing them
to this video in particular I'll tweet
about it as well and that way they can
look and be like hey I just got this
email that says I won I can go look at
what Paul just posted and confirm wow
that is at least my first name and
initial there and maybe the city that I
live in that way the winner can look
online to something that was just
recently posted by me hopefully via a
legitimate channel like Twitter or
YouTube and then that can help them
verify that they should answer the email
and of course I always give them the
option hey if you if you have any other
questions or if you want me to verify or
validate in any other way
then please do so but most of the time
they just reply and say hey wow I've
never won something before thank you so
much and I would say having done
giveaways not just on my channel but
also in the past on Newegg the response
I usually get from the giveaways is
really positive we've had giveaways that
I used to do back in the day where the
winners were just kind of like okay send
it here but the winners I usually pick I
don't know whether I'm just lucky or
something they're almost always like
I've watched your channel for a while
and thank you for this and that and that
really helps me because doing giveaways
like this can often be challenging and
even when I have giveaways that maybe
are just North America or otherwise it
seems like there's always somebody who
comes back it was like hey you know I'm
not able to enter for this
or whatever and that sucks I try to make
them as open and as available as I
possibly can but getting that feedback
at the end especially if the prize goes
to somebody who's appreciative and
especially if they've been a longtime
fan because that's really what I'm
trying to do is provide some level of
reward to you guys if you've been
following me watching my channel and
giving me feedback for quite some time
and that's how it goes so I will post a
list down in this video's description
and the comments that has all of the
winners that I've just now chosen I
wouldn't be posting that over on Twitter
as well so you should check your email
if you entered in this giveaway whatever
email you used to enter make sure that
you don't have an email for me because
it's gonna be 24 hours until this
expires and then I pick new winners for
the prizes that are not claimed I'll be
following up about that on Twitter I'm
not planning on making another
announcement video but guys thank you so
much for watching this video and now
it's just been kind of a short quick
announcement but for those of you who
were kind of curious how the end process
of a giveaway goes maybe this is
clarified a little bit for you and hey
if you guys have any suggestions or
ideas for other ways that I could do a
giveaway or any other means that I can I
can give back to you guys because I'm
always looking for ways to do that
within reason of course please post
those down in the comment section down
below I will check that out and see if
there's anything I can do and for all
the winners who have just been chosen
big congrats especially to the person
who won this looking forward to getting
this packed up and shipped and on its
way he has so much watching this video
check out my more recent videos if
you're interested in just kind of things
have been going on with me because I do
have a personal update that I've shared
that hopefully explains a little bit
more why and maybe lacking sleep and
stuff but I'm getting back into the
swing of things thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
