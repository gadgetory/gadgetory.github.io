link in the video's description what's
up guys how's it going welcome back to
Pauls hardware this is probing Paul
episode number 29 this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A
video where people ask me questions
about technology or other random stuff
and I answer those questions and I've
been doing this for I guess this is the
29th episode so that many episodes
here's a look at the cornhole of history
or whatever you want to call it going
look how tiny they get back there but if
you guys want to look at all their
questions I've answered then feel free
to check out my old probing Paul's there
is a playlist now in episode 28 actually
asked a question which is about
background music in videos such as this
where I'm just kind of talking at you
guys for a little while and the response
was pretty overwhelming actually and
actually eye-opening for me people don't
like the music they said it's
distracting if I'm just talking so I'm
going to take that to heart it does take
more effort to put the background music
in there and I will leave it out of this
type of video from now on except maybe
for some quick music for an intro or an
outro
I got a quite a few comments actually in
the comments from the last video - such
as Vito or the Al's just following up
and saying yes he actually prefers but
you know sits out background music so
cool I'm gonna stick with that I also
wanted to point out some additional
feedback I got from last month which is
about my audio and my audio is something
that I do try to keep an eye on not an
eye in ear I guess but I'm renting out
and several of the people who have
pointed out that you can hear my dog
here oh he's snoring in the background
so actually for today I'm going with a
different audio setup I'm using my lav
mic which has proven to be a little bit
better of a solution out here in the
garage
especially when it's really hot and
after an the air conditioner or of
course if hero is in here and he's
snoring or breathing loudly which he is
doing right now he's a hundred pound
Italian Mastiff mix and he can get a
little noisy sometimes so let me know I
actually have him in here right now and
he is breathing let me know if you
hereit's or if it's better or worse than
in the past videos when I've used this
mic this is actually condenser mic and
it's a good mic but it's not made for a
scenario like I'm in right now where
there's potentially other noise that it
could pick up on because it does do that
so for today I'm sticking with a lav mic
and again let me know what you guys
think if the audio is better this way
and of course how much you can hear
hero's breathing in the background one
more question
related to last month's video which is
about 140 millimeter fans versus hundred
and twenty millimeter fans and this is
just a little bit of math that I didn't
quite point out lots of people said it's
20 millimeters bigger of course 120 to
140
but with 120 140 you're talking about
the side of the fan measurements and of
course you have to multiply it both
sides in order to get the total area of
the fan and Williams just pointing out
here that 140 millimeter squared is a
lot bigger than 120 millimeter squared
120 times 120 is about 14400 140 times
140 is about 19,600 square millimeters
so 35% more area and that means it can
move more air and be quieter and all
that good stuff moving on the next
question here is from Niall Pierce and
he says hey Paul any chance you can do a
tutorial video on clean windows installs
or moving your installed operating
system over to a different storage drive
and I'll actually have several videos on
this topic specifically or at least
setting up a new PC my most recent one
is maybe two two and a half months ago
so I'll link that in the video
description if you want to check it out
that's taking you from the I just built
a new computer to getting Windows onto a
USB Drive and pulling that USB Drive in
and installing Windows onto the system
and getting it set up for the first time
which isn't always covered in my build
videos but you're talking about
migrating an operating system from an
existing computer over to a new computer
and you might notice that I almost never
do that and there's specific reasons
mainly due to my past experience with PC
building and attempting to migrate
operating systems over it's mainly a
peace of mind thing for me but there are
potential issues that can go on when
you're taking an operating system moving
it from one system to another with
completely different Hardware since
Windows 7 it has gotten a lot better so
it is something that you are possibly
able to do the reason I don't do
tutorials is because everyone's
situation is a little bit different so I
couldn't necessarily address the
potential problems that you might have
versus someone else who's migrating from
a completely different system the
easiest the simplest way the
confident way that you can be sure that
your new system is getting the maximum
amount of performance it's just to do a
clean install if you're moving from an
old system to a new system and you're
doing a clean install there's a pretty
short list of things that you can make
sure you do to get everything from your
old system on to your new system the
first is of course to check my documents
and hopefully you have a repository
where you've been saving everything
personal files and everything usually
that's my documents so back that up to
an external drive back everywhere else
that you might have saved files to an
external drive go into your install
programs lists and write down the names
of all the programs that you have
installed that you use regularly and I
also like to go into my browsers like
Chrome or Firefox and if you have a
bunch of shortcuts or bookmarks you can
actually back those up and save them
fortunately like with Chrome if you log
in with your Chrome ID it will save
those to the cloud now so you don't
necessarily need to do that stuff but if
you're not logging in with a cloud
account then that's something you should
probably do as well ultimately though I
just recommend the clean install because
it's the way you'll be ensured that your
system is going to be operating at peak
efficiency that you don't have any old
clutter from your old system that might
be bogging things down and causing the
system to take way too long to start up
or anything like that
and finally if you're familiar and
comfortable with a clean system install
and a reformat of your system if you
ever have issues in the future like
getting a virus or something like that
it's the easiest way to remove that I've
got all my stuff backed up elsewhere
wipe the drive reformat reinstall virus
is gone in like 99.9% of scenarios so
hopefully that helps you out and again
check that how to set up a new PC video
if you want a step-by-step guide next
question from silver rides he says given
that plenty of people are already buying
to 1080 T is at the time is the price of
2080s
really that crazy and I think he's
talked about 20 ATT is don't get me
wrong it's all crazy but people were
already spending that much money clearly
they had no problems buying them up as
soon as the 2080s came out so maybe
Nvidia knows exactly what they're doing
I think this is worth taking another
look at and so if I apologize if you get
any hate in the comments from people who
are like no their price gouging us and
we deserve to be able to buy twenty ATT
eyes for 800 bucks or whatever you
personally feel these cards should sell
for when I think about the twenty atti
pricing though what comes to mind most
often is the Titan and the Titan was
launched back in 2013 I think the first
version of it and it was $1000 at the
time when the most expensive graphics
cards were selling for five or
600 bucks each there are differences
between the launches the Titan was
launched as a bridge to the workstation
market so you could use it for gaming
but they're like no this is actually for
workstation stuff but then of course it
went into a bunch of high-end gaming
systems whereas the 2080 Ti is very much
this is a consumer graphics card that
we're expecting people to spawn spend
$1,200 on the reason I relate this to
the Titan is because I know the Titan
sold for as much of an elites out of
most people's price range product that
it was it still sold regularly and it
sold for $1000 to the point where they
felt comfortable releasing other Titans
that cost even more than that when it
came to like the Titan XP so if you
might look at that from invidious
perspective and give them the best
possible benefit of the doubt that you
can then you can say well they're making
a business's decision to sell these
cards at a certain price they know they
can get that much money for it and they
know there are enough people who will
pay that much to make it worth their
while despite all the other people who
can usually only afford cards that are
maybe three or four hundred bucks
complaining that this product is LEED
and outside the price range of most
people that said though if there is
frustration being directed at Nvidia
that is perfectly legitimate right now I
think it comes down to this Moore's law
is slowing down we're not able to get
the constant increases in performance
both for CPUs and what GPUs that we were
a little bit spoiled with in like say
the 90s and 2000's so if you look at the
past 20 years or so every few years you
could probably buy a new component a new
GPU a new CPU for the same price as you
spent a couple years back and get a
pretty solid boost in performance 10 20
30 40 percent sometimes whereas now the
performance improvements they're just
charging more money for and again from
invidious perspective that makes total
sense because their business they need
to make as much money as possible and
there's no competition from our
perspective that sucks because we have
been accustomed to being able to spend
the same amount of money a few years
later and get more performance now it's
a few years later and we have to spend
more money for more performance and of
course that pisses people off who are
used to the old style I like the old
style better - I agree that these cards
are very overpriced but as long as
people keep buying them Nvidia is gonna
keep selling them for that price and
it's not really going to matter how many
people complain that they can't afford
it as long as other people are actually
so that's how it's gonna go until AMD
comes up with something that's
competitive I hope that happens soon
next question from Drago hullick hey
Paul is the length of a cable ever a
bottleneck for gaming eg if I get 90
frames per second with my 2 meter HDMI
cable if I were to get a 5 meter or
longer one would I see any noticeable
changes I'm gonna address your question
in two ways first of all when it comes
to HDMI when you're talking about a
digital signal it's a yes or no game
there's nothing like with an analog
signal where it degrades and then you
get limited performance or not as many
frames per second if it's not working
it's not gonna work this does mean to
answer your question 2 meters 5 meters
no difference it's not gonna affect your
frame rate or anything like that the
larger question is how long can an HDMI
cable be and it turns out there is an
answer to that question I'll link this
article it's from 2011 but still
perfectly viable today about extending
HDMI cables it's from Popular Mechanics
it goes into a little bit more of the
details for that but 50 feet is the
short answer is the maximum length that
an HDMI cable can be and reliably still
provide a signal you'll find that if you
look at HDMI cables you probably will
have a hard time finding anything longer
than 25 feet and that's simply because
people don't often need anything more
than 25 feet and manufacturers don't
have to worry about those situations
where the source isn't able to actually
send the signal that far which can't
happen in certain situations I have a
couple products I wanted to show you
guys that are related to this but I need
to make a huge disclaimer first that my
wife works for monoprice so please don't
accept this as a full-throated
endorsement of monoprice or anything
like that I'm basically referring you to
the fact that these products exist and
when it comes to something like an HDMI
signal you actually have multiple
choices for how to extend that signal
longer if you so desire or need to and
one of the cool ways to do it is
actually to take the HDMI and feed it
into a cat 6 cable and there you can go
runs at least according to these
products of up to 164 feet so it's got a
main unit here that you feed power to
and then you feed your HDMI signal into
and then it's got four cat six outs
where you can take cat 6 cable and then
route those over to these smaller units
cat 6 go into this goes into the small
unit it's got an HDMI out and then you
plug that into your display and again
guys I'm only bringing this up because
it's something that exists and when it
comes to HDMI signals if you want to
take a source and then feed it to
somewhere very far away this is just
something that I was aware of that I'm
not
everyone might be but again just to be
fully clear my wife works for monoprice
so I want to disclose that before I talk
about any of their products anytime I
talk about any of their products moving
on though I have a couple questions from
Twitter this is from Rob at that mailing
guy he said an impromptu probing of Paul
Hardware I don't think he even knew that
I was about to do this Q&amp;amp;A video he says
he's recently upgraded to a 1070 TI he's
looking for a new monitor there's many
options and he wants my suggestions for
a budget of 400 to 500 $50 bigger the
better of course so I would want to
maximize your PC gaming advantages say
over consoles and I'm not saying
consoles are bad if you want a game on a
console that's fine but there are things
that you can say this is what PC gaming
is better at one of those is high
resolution you don't want to go 4k
because it'd be hard to push that with a
1070 TI so 2560 by 1440 I think is your
bread-and-butter range and then me on
that you want G sink because adaptive
framerate is one of the very nice things
again that PC gaming can do that you
can't necessarily get on the consoles so
looking at those two parameters 2560 by
1440 and gsync and I'm just looking at
Newegg for all of the monitors they have
I'm only looking at what new.i excels
because I don't like doing marketplace
sellers but here we can see we've got an
Acer and a OC we've also got Asus models
here that are within the 500 to $600
range this might be just ever so
slightly out of the five hundred and
fifty dollar max that you pointed out
but I would definitely say it's worth it
to try to try to creep up you know if
it's just a matter of another 15 or 20
bucks this is a 27-inch monitor so it's
a very nice-sized 2560 by 1440 is your
resolution and then also high refresh
rate this is 144 Hertz refresh rate and
you can overclock it potentially 265
Hertz there's also an asus rog swift
version for about 600 bucks these are TN
panels so they're not going to be quite
the level of color depth but honestly
for gaming I think the resolution
refresh rate and then of course G sync
is going to be a better bet and then I
also went and just did a similar search
here over here on PC part picker to try
to get a bit wider range of potential
stores and here you can actually see
there's some 24 inch versions you can
get for about 400 bucks
I'd recommend $500 and for $500 you can
get this one right here the Aesir
predator xbone the same one we were
looking at just a second ago that's
about 565 on Newegg it's actually
available on Amazon and Newegg business
for 500 bucks like that so this Acer
predator is what I would get right now
just
if I was shopping right now and needed
to buy something right now but again
double-check reality check take those
parameters 2560 by 1440 G's settings
support plug them in and then when it
comes to brands acer is a great choice
asus is a great choice dell has some
great options out there too i saw an LG
in there as well i've never had a
problem with them either so hopefully
that will help you out and one last
question here this one's a little bit
more random from Michael C he asks Paul
have you been losing weight um no wait
hold on a sec okay I literally just
wouldn't weighed myself because I had no
idea and I haven't weighed myself in a
while no Michael I have not lost weight
but I'm somewhat flattered that you
thought I did and I will hopefully use
this as motivation to continue
exercising and eating lots of fruits and
vegetables but gosh the holiday season
is upon us so that might be challenging
I'll do my best thank you for your
question Michael and thank you guys all
so much for watching this video if you
enjoyed it hit the thumbs up button and
of course leave me a question in the
comment section down below if you want
me to potentially answer it in next
month's probing Paul thanks again for
watching guys and we'll see you next
