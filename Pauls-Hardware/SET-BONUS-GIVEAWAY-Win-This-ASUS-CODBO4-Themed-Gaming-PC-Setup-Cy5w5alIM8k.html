video that I posted just recently
building this system right here it's an
epic system powered by an i7 9700 k-8
core unlock processor from Intel and an
r/t x20 atti the asus rog Strix call of
duty black ops for addition and in fact
much of the hardware in the system is
call of duty black ops 4 themed so
definitely check out that video if you
missed it this video though is sponsored
by Asus and I'm given all this stuff
away now the system itself turned out
quite beautiful if I do say so myself I
really like it it's kind of subtle you
got the RGB lighting in there but the
LEDs are currently set to sort of an
orange to yellow gradient I did that
using the Asus or a software and I'm
going to come back to this in just a
second before that I hear all the
peripherals you could potentially win in
this giveaway other than an internet
connection you pretty much have
everything you need to get started with
a gaming PC and even a few things you
didn't know you needed so we got the rog
delta quad DAC gaming headset features a
RGB of course as well as high resolution
audio quad acts as well as a 20 Hertz to
40 kilohertz frequency response range is
quite nice also has some pretty comfy
ear cups from my understanding next to
that is the rog Gladius 2 origin this is
the call of duty black ops 4 edition for
this gaming mouse from asus this has a
12000 dpi optical sensor a detachable
USB cable 2 level dpi switching and to
slide to press buttons which it sounds
fancy
I am specifically not opening these
peripherals so they don't get dusty and
messed up so that the winner has them
nice and fresh and new but there is at
least a closer look at this Mouse the
winner will also get an ROG spotlight
this is purely an aesthetic add-on but
it takes the ROG logo and displays it on
a wall or the floor or wherever you want
to display it also compatible with aura
sync because it is an RGB ROG logo we
have an ROG Strix flair full-size
mechanical gaming keyboard this uses
Cherry MX silver switches and this is
also called duty black ops 4 special
edition other than the fact that this is
a full-size keyboard which means you get
the 10 key and everything I like that
it's got these sort of accent lighting
along the edges and it's got a little
badge at the top and you can actually 3d
print your own and replace that not that
I think most people have access to that
but it is an option probably more
practical is the USB pass-through which
is also a feature I really like on a
keyboard
keep everything matchy-matchy we have an
RG Strix edge call of duty black ops 4
mouse mat this is a 450 by 400
millimeters 2 millimeters thick and you
put your mouse on it and of course this
g-sync monitor the PG 2 5 8 25 inch rog
swift gaming monitor 240 Hertz for fresh
rates so you're gonna see your frames
faster than anyone else sees their
frames if they have less than 240 Hertz
refresh rate also 1 millisecond response
time DisplayPort and HDMI connectivity
now over here all the retail boxes for
the system that has been put together so
I'm going to include these accessories
where relevant and everything so you'll
get everything that came with for
example the 1200 watt ROG Thor platinum
power supply comes with cable mod cable
combs I used some of those but not all
of them but let's go over all the parts
that are installed in this beastly
gaming system starting with the case
that's holding everything together that
is the Leanne Lee 11 err this one is the
RGB version that comes with a few extra
RGB LED fans which I have installed
right there as you can see they're
orange synched up with the rest of the
colors in the system internally right
here we have a 360 millimeter all-in-one
liquid cooler this one was recently
launched by Asus part of their RG lineup
the region 360 my apologies if I'm not
pronouncing that very well but 360
millimeter radiator it's got Noctua CRO
max fans that are all black there on the
top keeping things nice and chilly oh
well I need to splay on the side as well
as some RGB LEDs that again I have
synced up with the Ora sync lighting and
I use the utility to switch this to an
all-white RG logo so it would blend in a
little bit better that is cooling an
Intel Core i7 9700 k processor which is
an 8 core unlock CPU no hyper threading
on this one but it is a very good CPU
for gaming as well as other tasks with
all 8 cores available next to that is
the memory which is a Corsair Vengeance
RGB kit there's actually 4 8 gig sticks
total so 32 gigs in this system it's
running at ddr4 26 66 megahertz speed
for storage we have an Intel 600 P
series 512 gig nvme SSD that's installed
down at the bottom of the motherboard
under the m2 SSD heatsink which also has
some call of duty black ops for branding
on it the motherboard holding this all
together is the RG Maximus 11 hero Wi-Fi
special edition call of duty black ops 4
so you can see the cod Blops
four skull that's up here on the i/o
shield it does have a fixed i/o shield -
which is very nice as well as all the
features you would expect with the
Maximus 11 hero if you've seen other
videos on the non Call of Duty version
it's pretty much the same except for the
Call of Duty logos on the heatsinks and
then this also has a special custom BIOS
in it that will turn all of your LEDs
orange by default of course you can go
in and adjust this with the Asus or a
software if you want to and finally for
a gaming graphics card we have the
GeForce r-tx 2080 ti this is the RG
Strix gaming edition of this one and it
is again the call of duty black ops 4
special edition so again you'll have
orange LEDs that light up of course they
are RGB so you can switch them if you
want to call duty black ops 4 logo on
the back plate and then a custom paint
job on the front as well as some more
Call of Duty logos on the fans so guys
that pretty much sums it up for this
epic stack of hardware available in this
giveaway and a huge thank you to Asus
