welcome everyone to today's video it's
called the first 5 and I could actually
make this into an ongoing video series
if you guys enjoy it so feedback is
appreciated as always via comments likes
or dislikes down in the comment like and
dislike section down below now in my
opinion there's nothing like the fresh
feeling of a clean operating system
installation whether it's a new build
your reformatting you're doing the most
effective means of virus removal I have
been doing this quite a bit so for
today's video I'm going to tell you guys
the first 5 things that I do after
installing a new operating system
specifically Windows 8.1 in this
scenario but it also applies to Windows
7 for the most part now since all of my
viewers out there are pretty elite PC
builders I'm going to make some
assumptions so we can assume that it's a
given that the first things you're
actually going to do after windows 7 or
windows 8 gets all installed is install
the latest drivers for your Hardware
updating windows updates to its latest
windows updated mists and of course
replacing Internet Explorer with Chrome
or Firefox there that's much much better
of course in this case I also installed
OBS so I could screen capture my first 5
things so moving on to the first thing
that I do after that which is to access
folder options to turn off hide
extensions for files of known type I
absolutely hate this I have no idea why
it exists at all oh sure windows I'll
just memorize every single tiny icon
that a file could possibly have in order
to easily distinguish between an exe and
an ini file or a PDF and a PNG while I'm
here I also turn on hidden file display
and turn off hide empty drives because
those things are also dumb in their
default state the second thing that I do
is add a my computer icon to the desktop
this is just an old habit of mine and
I'm very accustomed to having it there I
right-click the desktop I go to
personalize I choose change desktop
icons and I select computer I'll also
use Windows Explorer jump lists pretty
frequently since I've been using Windows
7 and Windows 8 just to access my
computer or other file shortcuts but
having that my computer icon on the desk
up to so I can right-click it to access
properties or computer management I just
find it very handy so I always do that
the third thing that I do is go to nine
night calm and ini te and I install
these small and more useful programs
that I will end up installing anyway
this varies based on what the computer
is and what its going to be used for but
I'll often add for example Firefox
FileZilla notepad plus plus media monkey
runtimes like Java and.net Foxit reader
you can choose from a few popular and
free antivirus apps as well as
malwarebytes and of course steam and
then you get the little installers and
installs them all at once and then you
can even rerun that installer in the
future and it will update all of the
apps you already have installed to their
most recent versions it's beautiful the
fourth thing that I do is specific to
Windows 8 but I right-click on the
taskbar go to properties and I turn off
the windows 8 things that I do not like
in the navigation tab this means turning
off charms turning off the top-left
application switchy thingy and of course
telling Windows 8 to go to the desktop
instead of the Metro UI Start menu I
also like choosing show my desktop
background on Start which actually
almost makes the Metro UI Start menu
bearable to use if you want to totally
get rid of Metro UI I like to use
classic shell it's free and it's very
customizable the fifth thing that I do
is to pretty up to join a bit with some
fresh wallpaper
I like scenic photography and my
favorite website for that is interface
lift calm I'll choose a selection of
these beautiful images and download them
to a wallpapers folder that I create in
My Documents then under personalization
I choose the desktop background option
and I will direct the desktop
backgrounds over to that folder I have
it change once a day and then if I add
more images to that folder in the future
that windows will automatically add them
to the desktop background rotation and
that is all of my five things of course
there are other things that I would add
to this list if the list was longer than
a 5 item list most notably after
everything is set up perfectly but
before you install larger programs like
video game installations on Steam or
Adobe or the office suite I would use
the system image function which you can
actually find under Windows 7 file
recovery on Windows 8 or if you're on
Windows 7 it's under backup and restore
you can use
to create an image to restore back to in
the future and that will save you a lot
of time and all the setup stuff if you
ever decide to reformat your computer
again but I want to know what your first
five things are those annoying UI fixes
and behavioral changes that you just
have to do to a windows install as soon
as possible let me know in the comment
section down below whilst you
contemplate the finishing move that you
want to use on that like button and
