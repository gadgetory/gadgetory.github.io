3-way radiator support for water cooling
so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
how's it going welcome back to Pauls
hardware today's video is my follow-up
video my testing video on my fastest
computer that you can build in 2018 that
being supported by the newest Intel Core
i $9.99 hundred K a quart sixteen thread
processor and of course I've also got an
RT X 20 atti in there this is the asus
rog Strix version of that beyond that we
also have at asrock z 390 Taichi
ultimate motherboard that's kind of
tying everything together it's all put
together in this lammle 0:11 dynamic
case the Devourer Edition and whites
main storage drive is the Samsung 970
Evo nvme SSD we have a cooler master ml
360 our 360 mm meter closed-loop CPU
cooler to keep everything cool because
the 9900 K has been rumored to run a
little warm in my initial testing video
for the 9900 didn't share temperature
numbers and I'm hopefully gonna be
following up on that today because
temperatures are important also the
behavior of the 9,900 k by default with
the motherboard as well as the intel
default settings i'm going to give a
comparison back and forth between those
and hopefully i'm also just gonna play
some games for a while because that's
kind of what i want to do that would be
fun writing out the specs so we also
have a G scale Trident C RGB kit and
that's the 3200 speed kit running at
casa latency 14 and then finally got an
extra SanDisk Ultra - one terabyte SSD
down there at the bottom just providing
some storage for video games and
anything else we might need extra
storage for right now I'm running
hardware info 64 CPU z-tech power ups
gpu-z utility and I'm also running an
Ida 60 for system stability tests which
is currently been going for seventeen
and a half minutes or so this is just so
I can get a baseline when it comes to
the CPUs temperatures and performance as
far as system setup goes all I've done
is update the motherboards bios to the
current version 1.38 and then I have set
the XMP setting for the memory in there
as well again which is 3200 speed casts
latency
tene and we can see that here when it
comes to the DRAM frequency as well as
the casa latency numbers what this is
resulting in right now is a core voltage
that's vacillating between about one
point two six and one point three to
eight I'm getting an average of one
point two nine max of one point three
two which is a little bit high by
default and that is resulting in some
pretty high temperatures as well we can
see our maximum temperatures on the CPU
cores are hitting upwards of ninety five
degrees 96 and 97 on a few of the cores
meanwhile average temperature is 88
degrees Celsius and that is pretty
toasty especially considering that we
have a three hundred and sixty
millimeter radiator in there and the
voltage is higher than it should be but
nests not necessarily crazy high on the
plus side we are maintaining pretty high
CPU frequencies four point seven
gigahertz across all cores and that has
been maintaining steady and stable so as
long as you have a pretty nice
water-cooled you can run the CPU at this
frequency and it's not that difficult
but it is warmer than we'd like granted
again this is a stress test that's been
running for over 20 minutes so I'm going
to shut this down and then we can
immediately see our CPU temperatures
start to cool way off so that is good I
am going to jump back into the BIOS I'm
going to see if I can go and do the
Intel recommended settings versus the
asrock maybe a little bit more
aggressive settings because this is
their highest and Taichi ultimate
motherboard with good power delivery
that can run at higher frequencies but
let's see what Intel had in mind and if
we see any difference when it comes to
the frequency as well as the temperature
so it's been a pretty decent amount of
time searching around the ufi settings I
was looking for a setting for s vid
which is the voltage as dictated by the
CPU CPU has its own voltage regulators
and can call for how much voltage at
once turning that off allows the
motherboard to dictate how much voltage
is supplied and that appears to be what
is causing those main discrepancies
between the people who are getting
reasonable temperatures with the 99
hundred K and people who are getting
much hotter temperatures but also better
performance with the 99 hundred K it's
just not there as far as I can find it
in this version of the asrock UEFI if it
is there maybe someone can let me know
in the comments section where it might
be hiding but for now I did a few
different tests with various methods and
it just seems like it wants to run at
that full fat mode so I'm just going to
keep it running in that mode so that
means that for the rest of the testing
today my clock speeds are gonna be
hitting 5 gigahertz so I'm one or two
cores and 4.7 gigahertz
across all cores CFU temperatures again
were pretty warm but not insanely warm
again bear in mind that I 264 CPU stress
test so typically you're not gonna see
temperatures anywhere near that when
you're just doing normal stuff like
gaming case-in-point here I just ran the
time spy stress test just to verify I
didn't get the 99% but I got ninety
seven point nine percent which is good
enough maximum core temperature was like
70 degrees so that's what you could
expect while you're playing a video game
well within reason and definitely
showing that if you do want a ninety
nine hundred K and you want to get the
most out of it a three hundred sixty
millimeter radiator cooler might be a
better bet for that just to help keep
temperatures down over time and I'm
happy to say that the cooler master ml
360 our RGB is doing a great job for us
so far so moving on since this is
supposed to be the fastest gaming PC
ever I am going to continue testing some
games to give a bit more of an a/b
comparison from my introductory tests
with the ninety nine hundred K and with
the 20 80 TI I'm running fire strike so
I'm gonna run fire strike extreme and
I'm gonna run time spy just so I can get
some comparisons to the numbers I had a
few weeks ago to the numbers I'm getting
now and once this is all done though I
will hopefully be able to actually play
some video games I tweeted on Twitter to
get some feedback from you guys what
people want to see me test I have some
good suggestions so I'm gonna dive into
those coming up next so here's a result
of fire strike ultra test the graphics
score of eight thousand ninety one
physics score of twenty four thousand
eighteen fifty nine overall 82-68 and if
we compare that to my results it
actually it dropped a little bit well
the graphics core dropped but just by
about 20 points so that's the within
margin of error but we're getting
roughly the same score there when it
comes to graphics but we did get a
little boost when it comes to the
overall score and that's gonna mainly be
because of the increased physics here
are our 3d mark test results GPU clock
speed is running in the high 1700 s and
low 1800 s it appears to be peaking at
about nineteen thirty five megahertz
overall and that gave us a time spy
overall score of 13 to thirty six with
the graphics score of thirteen seven
twenty eight but yeah we compare it to
my launch day tests and this is what the
founders edition twenty atti
as well as an eighty seven hundred k we
got a score of thirteen thousand two
hundred and eighty six so here actually
got a pretty nice boost to jumping up to
thirteen thousand seven hundred about a
500 point
boost and again that's just going from
the manufacturer overclocked Strix
version here to the manufacturer
overclocked founders edition clock which
is not too big of a difference in base
clock and boost clock but she's using
pretty much the same base clock and only
about a 20 megahertz boost on the loose
clock so just ran GTA 5 and I used the
built-in benchmark to run my typical
test again so I could get a comparison
against my former numbers with an 8700 K
and the 20 atti founders Edition I just
want to point out here that the
frequency was a little bit higher I was
running about 1852 1890 megahertz when
it comes to the GPU core clock the
histogram has gone there but trust me
that's exactly what it was showing and
then I just a single run here normally I
do multiple runs but this is just to
show you guys real quick what the
results are average frame time was 10
point 3 milliseconds which gives 97
frames per second on average you can see
the little Peaks here these are outliers
there's really only one that jumped up
over 33 point 3 milliseconds so that's
not bad at all
1% time with 66 frames per second so if
you wanna play GTA 5 at 4k resolution on
a 60 Hertz monitor then the r-tx 20 atti
does seem to be a pretty good solution
for that if the question is do you need
a 9900 K in order to do that though well
the answer would be no and here again
just case in point that a high
resolutions 4k in particular and a
little bit less so at 1440 you will get
the most out of your graphics card
regardless of the CP you are using
whether you're using a 9900 K and 8700 K
or even like a 2700 x @ 4k those
differences lie with the GPU and that
with the CPU so with the 8700 K score
was about the same 97 7 frames per
second and with the minimum of 69 frames
per second versus hours of 66 over here
just getting into call of duty black ops
4 here and in order to do my settings
properly I'm playing it for K 60 Hertz
and I've got pretty much everything set
to very high though these are mostly
default settings that I had when I load
it into the game I have of course turned
off vsync actually in the game right now
I am getting in the mid-90s frames per
second wise sometimes dipping into the
80s but overall very solid players oh do
you fly in on a helicopter press F to
suck my D this is
it's kind of fun we're in a squadron of
helicopters yeah still does the
automatic parachute deploy very gonna
die welcomed welcome to battle royale
game over at least five other people
died before me check out me dying well
he that's not fair he has a gun how did
he even thought he saw me through there
and then he just jumped at it I'm gonna
do quads doing quads I have friends to
help me alright well I try to catch my
teammates a quick update on statistics
right now CPU temperature is actually
very reasonable we're only in the mid
50s maybe getting into sixty from time
to time or at 4.7 gigahertz pretty much
across the board on all cores which is
cool too GPU temperature is it's 68
degrees right now and we're hitting
about eighteen thirty ish megahertz on
the frequency where did all my teammates
go I'm gonna go in here and see if
there's a weapon or something oh look
there's dude I'm pressing the wrong
button
that's why cluster grenade
that just equipped that it I dropped now
I just dropped Italy I pressed the wrong
button
reviving brace dog I got you all right
whoever is attacking us must have given
up or we killed them 21 people left
doing way better than in the first round
where I died within 10 seconds this
guy's really a really good teammate okay
head up again hey I did better that time
all right guys I'm gonna do another run
of black ops for 2560 by 1440 here so I
mean I can get back to blackout mode I
liked the quads option having some
teammates really helped me out last time
all my teammates there one I saw green
there's green I'm following enough we
only have three on our team too which is
actually gonna give us an advantage you
know we're more agile and made some
there's a is that recon card I feel like
I should hang out by calm killer is he's
a killer that he's also he's ice cold
about it teammates are giving
information out again I need to I need
to back them up oh Sh I'm coming for you
save me
slowly crawl towards my teammates maybe
they'll find me oh hey oh you're
reviving me thank you following you come
killer
oh yes that's update we're you're
hitting a much higher framerate now
we're actually getting in the 140 160
FPS range so a nice jump dropping down
from 4k to 2560 by 1440 it's not helping
my gameplay at all I still and mainly
operating as a decoy here but maybe I
can help calm killa kill someone calmly
that's not well that's not what I meant
to do at all that sucks
I got level 2 armors that's kind of
useful look I just walked he just walked
in there's like why did he set that up
right there because I suck why am i
chasing after right now something in the
sky
what's this red thing on the map is that
me yeah oh that's me okay I'm chasing
after myself on the map I'm not damaged
I'm at a hundred percent health it's
from blend blood splattered it before I
healed myself apparently yeah it's up
250 I guess discovering so many useful
things to do with this game 95 no you
have to play the game a lot I guess
yeah I shot a guy did I get credit and
the killfeed there and everything yeah
it's collapsing on us swimming
she has a perfect that's it not a
breaststroke just the Freestyle Oh
where's that
trying to revive him okay kill Jeff this
is dude killing me okay yeah I won Gary
like kill all of us I needed to shoot
him before I worried about reviving my
teammates right lesson laying there okay
sorry for the ghetto production
techniques guys with my audio stopped
working so and I'm playing overwatch and
here in the settings I have full screen
and playing 1920 by 1080 because the
request from Twitter was to play a 1920
by 1080 higher end shooter and see if we
could get a really high frame rate so
I've got the frame rate cap set to 300
and I'm using the ultra quality presets
so let's go ahead and jump in play some
overwatch well the idea of the high
refresh rate is that frame is going to
refresh earlier than the person who
doesn't have a higher refresh rate
monitor so you're gonna see what's
happening on screen quicker yeah so if
it's a game of reaction time and
response time and whatever does all
those moments
what Wow
okay Wow that's foolish yeah that's
doomed just being Opie right now also
realizing that I'm easily hitting little
over I'm easily heating the frame limit
cat 300 at this setup so
oops
Critias fist ya doom fist really is he's
pissin everybody daddy not stuff just
some kind of time just kind of tell when
our team was getting worked
repeatedly fest it
yay we want a battle and then I die
because to fart might actually be doing
anything
ah as a waste honestly to kill one
person with that was my ultimate both
heels and evidence is that possible
that's bullshit what I was just healing
and she was just sucking the life out
and somehow her you're sucking your life
sucking skills did more than my healing
skills
it doesn't seem we're the same character
doesn't seem like that should be a thing
her second skills are better than yours
haha I know but he killed me with that
just as Dumas tried to tried to drop the
hammer on me hey that was mostly
pointless anyway because the frame rate
was so high the whole time alright guys
that is pretty much me wrap it up for
this video thank you so much for joining
me and watching and if you have learned
a little bit more about what a computer
that features a ninety nine hundred K
and a twenty eighty Ti is capable of I
know I didn't test a huge range of games
today but I just wanted to kind of play
some games get the system up and running
and see how it performs call of duty
black ops for the able to hit well over
90 frames per second at 4k as well as
one hundred forty eight hundred sixty
frames per second at 2560 by 1440 and
then of course you saw over watch if
you're trying to hit that three hundred
frames per second cap and you're playing
on a high refresh rate 1080 monitor then
yes it's 2080 I will more than do the
trick in fact I think you probably
should upgrade your monitor if that's
the way you're playing thank you guys so
much again for watching this video hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed it
and of course links to the build videos
as well as all the parts involved are
down in the description too thanks again
guys and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
