combination the mix of poop and flowers
its flowery poop okay but we should like
just about be live right about now so
hey everybody and let me type cool yeah
let's go my right now all right hey guys
how's it going hey welcome to awesome
hardware if you're not familiar with
awesome hardware I will briefly explain
what it is and what we're all about
it's a live show we discuss technology
we drink beer and we occasionally do use
adult language cursing from time to time
so if you've got little ones with
sensitive hearing hearing or not
sensitive so you not like hearing that
kind of thing it's not like we have foul
like potty mouths entire in the entire
time it's you know it's just
occasionally we speak freely here on the
show so yeah I wanted to give a brief
disclaimer even beyond that I also drink
some beer so if you're of a of age and
drink responsibly please feel free to
join us Cheers yes we're watching the
show today
you stay you internet and this is
episode number 149 we're outside B right
now that means we've already been doing
the show for about an hour ish a little
over an hour actually that was streamed
at Kyle's channel bit wit and it's
linked in the video's description so if
you're watching this in the future on my
channel Paul's hardware you might want
to check that at first if you're
watching on twitch you can watch the
entire thing live switch top TV /
awesome hardware and of course will
stream every even every Tuesday evening
at 5:30 p.m. Pacific time although we
should also warn you guys that we're
gonna be on hiatus for like a good month
actually over a month because it's gonna
be four weeks and we're gonna miss yep
coming up at the end of May and first
few weeks of June this is surrounding
Computex house gonna be gone the week
after the Computex I'm gonna be gone the
week before Computex yep and then of
course we're both gonna be in Taipei for
counter sex yeah so we'll give you guys
more details on that but just so you
guys know trying to try to ease you into
it more than you guys up front we're not
gonna be doing the show for several
weeks during that time period so
apologies for that but we may do like a
go during Computex if we can swing it
just just to kind of tie things together
she can't be that long without a show
because we're staying in the same hotel
yeah and we do have that option Computex
is always a lot of fun so hopefully
we'll get you guys something and in
between there okay one last thing if you
guys want to help support our channels
then get yourself some merchandise
that's very very nice in high quality
check out our stores Paul's Harbor net
is my store shirts mugs pint glasses got
hoodies and stuff Natsu got the new
oxblood t-shirt sort of a reddish deep
maroon hue with my thumb screw logo on
it also got these lightweight hoodies
now good days shirt lightweight hood
eyes and well yeah I haven't tried the
actual hood on this there it is it's
very mysterious right yep these are
pretty lightweight so you can firm like
it's like t-shirt material a little bit
thicker but yeah it's good they're good
all-weather options a few of those
available as as the weather is warming
up slightly it's a good option yeah
Kyle's store is bit wit tech slash store
and he also has lots of awesome merch it
all comes from the same location and
it's all it's all really well made yes
shut up to John our merch guy cuz he
does a really good job with it
and yeah so buy stuff and we'll shout
out your name that's true at the end of
the show yes Johnson I usually use
another light weight hoodie that one's
not a zipper but does have a cool design
going across it's got the evolution
design really affordable awesome alright
we are going to continue with the
ever-important tech news on my half you
know what I should do is have my notes
lined up side up it sounded like I don't
know what I'm talking about
you should what the hell but I do know
what I'm talking about because the first
thing we're gonna discuss here is memory
memory price prices have been just
ridiculous for the past like year plus
yep right and maybe that's because of
specific reasons within the industry you
know the popularity of cell phones that
are
ddr4 memory for example honestly the
bulk of the actual sales of like DRAM
goes to goes to servers and enterprise
market but there's of course other
destinations for DRAM chips but the
accusation that is referenced in this
article from hardware is pointed at
Samsung hynek's and micron and those
three DRAM manufacturers control about
96 percent of the global DRAM market the
lawsuit has been put forth by the law
firm Hagens Berman and it's a class
action lawsuit against these three
companies it was filed yesterday the
suit claims that after a global decline
in the price of ram chips back in june
2016 these three companies began to
deliberately limit their output of drm
because DRAM is a relatively inelastic
market like people even like people use
computers for lots of things people need
memory for those computers it doesn't
really go away so much anything
especially if the bulk of the market is
controlled by several small companies
there is a historic precedent for this
happening in the past I'll get back to
that in just a second but June 2016 it
alleges that these three companies
deliberately limited their output by
limiting the output it constricts supply
if demand stays the same and supply goes
down then price goes up that is how
that's kind of one of the basic things
and how economics work so the suit
alleges that you can specifically track
these bumps in DRAM prices that you can
track going back sentence to 2016 to the
aftermath of industry events where these
three companies would have had like
executives that could have gotten
together at like face-to-face meetings
and had discussions that would be off
the record and that kind of thing this
is all alleged by the way we should
point that out but obviously demand
prices being what they are it seems like
based on historic precedent that's you
know there might be some validity to
this lawsuit
their actions the limitation of the
production of DRAM resulted in the price
of a four gig stick of DRAM jumping a
hundred and thirty percent during the
class lawsuit period which is from July
1st 2016 to February 1st 2018 just a
couple months ago coincidentally in the
same time period as we already discussed
a bit on Kyle's half of the show Samsung
hynek's and micron also experienced more
than a doubling in their revenue that is
fishy so they've been doing quite well
but this is specifically between q1 2016
and q3 2017 now we should point out that
these are the manufacturers of the DRAM
chips the the the like these will black
chips right there
so if you're thinking about memory that
you buy from specific memory
manufacturers you're probably thinking
of like crazy skill or something like
that
granted you can buy Samsung memory and
micron memory but those manufacturers
buy the DRAM chips from from these
manufacturers and then they actually put
it on a PCB and everything like that and
right handle the sales and potentially
warranty and that kind of thing so you
know don't go hating on those sort of
in-between companies use this commodity
to create a product that you can use in
your computer but moving on this all
happened before this the I mentioned the
historic precedents here's the story a
few 914 the register this story was from
2014 but the actual time period in
question is 1998 to 2002 so back in 2007
a lawsuit was filed against Samsung
micron hynix those same three also
included at that time was Infineon NEC
and Toshiba they were accused much like
they have been just recently of price
gouging tactics between 1998 and 2002
hmm this is gone way back that suit
resulted in a 310 million dollar
settlement package worked out between
the chip men
chipmakers and of course they denied any
wrongdoing as part of this settlement
package and the US attorneys general
there were also other settlements as a
result of this law suits including a 300
million dollar deal with Samsung hynek's
in 2005 to 2006 now there's a III I
don't know this specifically but there's
a decent chance that these settlement
packages the amounts that they were
charged probably less than what they
made by increasing the price of their
product during that time that's it's
relatively safe to say that yeah so it
doesn't pay crime doesn't pay
yeah here's the moral of the story and
so if they're doing it early if they're
doing that worth if they're doing that
again
then you know maybe they're like alright
this this could be a calculated move
we're gonna do this over the course of a
couple years after while people will get
wise to it and we'll probably get sued
and we'll pay that money but we'll have
made this much and we'll have paid this
much yeah
so it's shady yeah so you know who knows
if this is just gonna be a cycle that
continues and happens again in the
future
but yeah this is relatively new this
particular lawsuit there's actually
there's also action performed by from
China their National Development and
Reform Commission pricing supervision
Department back in December of 2017 and
after that happens the the chip
manufacturer is committed to increasing
production again so right now we're
seeing sort of a the prices start to
drop back down hopefully they will go
back to being competitors with one
another and trying to steal each other's
market share which would drive price
down even more because I recently
discovered I have a video coming out in
the next day or two talking about some
of this and how it's affected like what
you would pay for a reasonably good
gaming PC right now yeah and I went back
to my old monthly builds videos that I
did and like I hadn't realized how far I
had dropped up like right now you're
gonna pay well maybe not right now but
like a few weeks or a month ago you were
gonna pay about 200 bucks for a 16 gig
ram kit yeah and about a hundred bucks
for in foreign aid kits right two years
ago in 2016 we have fifty eight dollars
you can get a 16 gig kit yeah there's a
$15 16 gig 2400 speed kit that I
included in one of my things there's a
$70 3000 speed ddr4 kit for 70 bucks
it's like yeah I mean the prices are
absolutely ridiculous and how much
they've increased compared to what we
know they can sell them for and still
make a profit how much of this loss to
do you think is valid and how much of it
is just here saying yeah I don't know
like you have an opinion either way like
my my gut would say yeah my suspicion
would be that there is some level of
collusion going on in order to limit
price because you have to look at where
the incentive is like and their options
are like let's continue manufacturing as
much as we can and sort of keep making
this much money or let's limit what we
output maybe even have to pay less for
you know don't have to pay as many
workers and stuff like that if they're
producing less and make more money like
obviously you go with option B all else
aside I mean if there's legal
constraints that prevent you know Mop
monopolies or
companies from working together like
that then obviously that's a concern for
you but if all you're thinking about is
making money then you would go with the
choice that makes you more money and the
choice that makes you more money is
limiting production and causing prices
to go up so you know it's you know I'm
wondering is how how would a plaintiff
prove that a company like Samsung was
not producing the volume of RAM or
memory that they are capable of you know
what I mean like how does that the
burden of proof like how does that even
and that's that's how could you fight
that that's a question in this case and
from what I've read about it so far
the case isn't necessarily saying
like here's the smoking gun or here is
the you know chain of emails between the
executives saying like yeah let's cut
production or whatever like that I don't
think there's anything to any direct
evidence that's that's showing this it's
more saying like look at the market and
look look at what's happened and there's
no practical explanation for this
happening
aside from there being some level of
coordination between these companies to
reduce their their their actual
production and output their fact it's
like we said after nets are is proof
Graham being eaten up by cellphone sales
and other products that that the RAM
might be used for used in but if that
can't be if you can't show exactly like
here is the demand that ate them all up
then there might be some way of you know
going through discovery and finding
evidence to support that claim and I'm
not I am NOT a lawyer so I do not know I
wish I was the details of how that would
work
all that is to say if you want to know
what happens back in the Ram bubble of
1998 to 2002 so 1998 to 2002 was when
the prices were high lawsuit was filed
in 2005 the settlement came in 2014 so
that's damn 16 that's 12 to 16 years
after it actually happened crazy you
could go onto this website this set up
and and you could get 10 bucks 10 bucks
was the minimum so if you bought like a
single kit of memory that was overpriced
then you could get ten bucks back but
you know I
if you had records of your sales and
whatever and you spent a lot more than
then you could you could get more more
back I don't know the exact rule the
actual payouts and stuff now this time
around it seems like the this lawsuit is
being filed much closer to the actual
events happening so I don't know if
that's going to have any effect on it if
this is actually legit and it goes
through and they make a settlement or
otherwise found culpable for these
actions
it's hard to say what actual money back
you might be able to get you know if you
bought a $200 16 gear gram kit in the
past year or something like that but
they apply interest and inflation
probably not rates probably not probably
not but that should have been $100 well
you get 15 thank you if the ultimate
upshot is that you know they're gonna
start increasing output now and RAM
prices are gonna start dropping back
down like I want to say I'm okay with
that but that's like that's at least a
good outcome like it sucks that this all
happens but we need RAM prices to come
down to to make what we do more viable
and to be able to sell people like here
build this awesome gaming PC so yeah
it's been tough right hopefully that's
what happens yeah all right let's
continue with some hopefully more good
news yeah although still somewhat
speculative mmm this is an ARS technica
article and this is why this year's
insane graphics card price surge might
be over hmm this is specifically tying
in to the price of ether at least that's
what this chart is looking at this is
looking at the prices of rx 570s and RX
5 ATS the blue line compared to the
price of ether yeah aetherium
which is the little gray line here
now of course RX 5 70s and 5 ATS have
been very overpriced for quite some time
largely due to their popularity and
effectiveness at mining cryptocurrency
aetherium in particular is well as other
cryptocurrencies that are resistant to
ASIC designs such as Bitcoin but the
going rate for graphics cards like the
570 and 580 more than doubles going back
from the beginning of this chart in May
2017 to their peak here and about
February of 2018 so pretty insanely
expensive the price of ether and other
major crypto currencies has been
trending downward since January so you
can see this bit of drop-off here it has
rebounded recently just in the past
couple weeks
back from 400 up to I think 600 ish
dollar range but it peaked at about 1400
in January so it has dropped off now
there's still the question of like is
there going to be some ether
replacements if their replacement that
comes out there are other
cryptocurrencies that are also asic
resistance and the similar designs to
aetherium so there's no telling for sure
that this in particular is the single
contributing factor to graphics card
prices starting to come down but it
could be part of it bit main has also
manufacturer started manufacturing and
shipping an aetherium ASIC mining
machine we talked about that a little
bit on the show as well so that could
also not just provide other viable
alternatives than graphics cards for
miners to buy but it could also increase
the difficulty because the more the more
mining horsepower is going towards
mining etherion the more difficult
mining etherium becomes also there is
the chance of aetherium moving from
proof of work to proof of stake and that
would greatly impact the effectiveness
of mining with GP with graphics cards
because that would completely be
emphasized mining with graphics cards it
would go to proof of stake which would
mean I'm not even gonna try to explain
what I mean you do this existing
etherion to get more aetherium anyway
but more to the points and the article
shows here a comparison of a picture of
the best by graphics cards aisle in
January pretty empty right here pretty
empty compared to just recently this is
within the dam oh sorry sorry about that
dogs are so excited yeah so yeah back at
the beginning of January the rx5 80s at
Best Buy were selling for
how much five hundred and thirteen
dollars no no no there's five hundred
thirty dollars Bank Ebert Guinea January
and they were sold out now they're being
sold for four hundred and twenty dollars
and they are in stock and in fact we'll
check again here in just a second but
you can get them even cheaper than that
and in stock if you're looking online
now continuing to talk about possible
impacts on graphics card pricing and
discussed in just a previous story is d
RAM prices because the price of memory
as well as gddr5 for example has caused
the like Nvidia change the the MSRP s of
like the gtx 1070 for example simply
because of the increased cost of memory
aside from the class-action lawsuit we
just discussed I also mentioned China's
National Development and Reform
Commission's pricing supervision
departments the NDRC began investigating
price-fixing from those four major NAND
production players Samsung Hanks micron
and Toshiba back in December of 2017
just or shortly after that manufacturer
is committed to increasing production
and we could potentially see a continued
drop in D Ram prices which could also
impact GPU prices so those those are all
factors that could be causing the price
of graphics cards to come down and as
we've done here on the show before I'm
gonna do a live a live check right now
this is this is a new egg okay alright
five babies or such reasons for egg
let's little try try the five eighty
sure passed up that all right five
eighty what's not 1084 okay this is
that's just a default five eighty and
when we went to the eight gig five
eighty sold by new egg and let's go
lowest price as everything so large
sapphire 329 all right so these are open
box but you can get an 8 gig 580 this is
in stock for 330 340 340 345 the
cheapest like noon
not open box one is $345 I mean it's
getting better but it's still far off
from what the MSRP is still a hundred
bucks over MSRP well MSRP is 250 this is
gtx 1070 MSRP right here after this is
get a gtx 1074 this amount which is
significant bastard you can't no no when
it first one okay when it first launched
theoretically in a perfect world so
that's what I wanted to check next was
our gtx 1070 prices now they're gonna be
of course way inflated when they first
launched you could find like a like
maybe not a Founders Edition but just
something to some bear basic cooler on a
1074 around 350 to 375 dollars so we've
got open box ten 70s for four hundred
and fifty six dollars four hundred and
eighty dollars the cheapest brand-new
1070 on Newegg that's in stock is five
hundred dollars right now which is about
a hundred bucks more than it should be
similar to the five eighty s so still
expensive they're not like as crazy as
they were like a month or two ago but
still pretty damn expensive and hey if
you're considering spending five hundred
bucks on a 1070 look at 1070 t eyes
please because look ten dollars more
that's a good deal ten dollars more over
the tea island that seems like a good
deal Kyle that seems like a good deal by
comparison based on what we're given a
1070 t I should cost four hundred and
fifty to four hundred and seventy
dollars right so this is only maybe 40
50 bucks overpriced and again that seems
like it could deal exactly kinda doesn't
it maybe sort of maybe a good deal
compared to the 1070 the thing that I
was noticing here first off is that no
egg for some reason seemed late 1080 GTX
to anywhere than 1080 T eyes go there's
just not it's not available oh it's
because I still have a cake selected
sorry sorry
okay for some reason no egg groups the
1080 and 1080 TI in the same category
that's kind of odd but 1080 you can get
for 580 bucks these are open box open
box
alright cheapest 1080 is $600 right now
on new egg brand new and then 1080 Ti so
I thought was somewhat interesting 1080i
are still like easy thousand dollars
cheapest one nine hundred and forty
dollars but they're almost double a 1080
yeah but if you go back if you go back
to certainly you know three four months
ago when graphics cards were overpriced
but we're like well what can you still
buy the things you could still buy were
the cheapest and the most expensive and
video cards so you could still get 10
80s and 1080 is for roughly the same
price 1080i especially you know it's
stuck it's at 700 bucks right for a
reasonable amount of time
it's only in the past few months I feel
like it's suddenly even those highest
end cards have also gone way is it cuz
people observed optimizing these higher
end cards for for mining is that why
that they're able to sell at a higher
price now because they're more desirable
for miners whereas back when they
weren't yes I think I think mining on
NVIDIA GPUs has become more viable over
time yeah because they're also pretty
efficient but anyway let's move on sure
talking next about Intel Intel has
delayed they announced they're delaying
their mass production of 10 nanometer
CPUs to 2019 this article here from an
antic by Anton and this is actually
pretty pretty decently big news Intel's
suffered a lot of bad news over the past
year or so I'd say they're facing a lot
more competition from AMD on the CPU
side and 10 nanometer has been in the
works for a while and they keep seeming
to have have to delay it they were
originally supposed to ship 10 nanometer
products in volume in the second half of
2016
they then delete that 228 second half of
2017 and then Cannon Lake was supposed
to ship in the first half of 2018 and
then they were like second half 2018 and
now they're talking 2019 so yeah that
kind of sauce a cow sucks for Intel this
announcement came on Thursday of last
week April 26 and they are actually
currently shipping some 1090 of your
product products but they're shipping
them in small volumes and they say due
to costs they have not ramped
high-volume manufacturing for 10
nanometre stuff executives from the
company also stated that they are
confident of their product roadmap and
intend to launch whiskey Lake and
cascade Lake products later this year
which sounds like something you'd say as
an executive by the way we're announcing
this disappointing thing for investors
but we're still confident since our
confidence and being confident about
confident things Why Why are they
delaying it's they're having difficulty
with high transistor I'm sorry there's
difficulty with this actual product
because they have very high transistor
density and caught the consequent heavy
use of multi patterning for low yields
so in some cases after new quad Penta or
hexa patterning for four times five
times or six times which means they
reexpose the wafer up to six times in
order to draw the features of the cpu
that lengthens the manufacturing cycle
and it can also affect yields as well
that of course by definition increased
increases the cost the current 10
nanometer manufacturing technologies is
deep ultraviolet lithography so the
lasers are operating on a 193 nanometer
wavelength wavelength they're working
also on up come up coming seven
nanometer manufacturing process
technology that will use EUV technology
or extreme ultraviolet as opposed to d
UV they say it's not quite ready yet but
UV lithography uses laser laser
wavelength of 13.5 nanometers for select
layers and it also would eliminate the
use of extreme multi patterning for
certain metal layers so there seems to
be some hopeful to get past some of the
difficulties with 10 nanometers simply
based on the lithography that they're
currently using but the article also
says that they said the seven nanometer
isn't quite ready for Showtime yet so
they're still working on getting
products out based on ten nanometer I
already mentioned many delays with this
but can like processors according to
Intel have actually shipped this year in
small volumes an antic learned that
these were Canon like you parts but
Intel has refused to state who the
customer is or where anyone can buy them
so that our Canon like 10 nanometer CPUs
out there we just don't know what
products they're they're integrated into
what which seems weird kind of surfaced
by now I don't know there must be
specialty products because they can't
make a lot of them yes article closes by
saying there is outside discussions that
means nothing that they've heard
directly from Intel but scuttlebutt from
amongst other people that they talk
about this kind of thing with the Intel
could decide to switch right to seven
nanometer bypassing 10 nanometer
altogether hmm since they push this to
2019 they have a good seven months to
figure that out so easily something that
they could decide to modify in the
meantime but there you go
Canon like hopes are dwindling but we'll
see what Intel comes out with later this
year because they do continue to refine
their 40 nanometers and there is of
course they continued rumors of like a
core mainstream CPUs based on that and
whatnot which could still be effective
products just not going to benefit from
some of the efficiencies that
lithography shrink would generally get
them alright next article is from video
cards comm and this is about AMD Vega 20
so Vega 10 is what the current Vega GPU
is Vega 56 and Vega 64 based on
bigot 20 is a successor to that and not
only is it well it's exciting because
it's a it's supposed to be set based on
seven nanometer so it's the current or
the the the the the chip design that
they used for big at ten but shrunk to
seven ninety meter and according to this
article they're testing it right now
because apparently someone at AMD or at
Radeon was testing it and did not
disconnect from the internet from the
internet and allowed 3d markers to be
published great yeah
good for us this is listed as an AMD
Reagan radeon vega frontier edition
because it is specifically part of
radeon vega instinct so this is probably
going to be something that's attached or
that's part of their like super hans
series of graphics cards so you remember
like frontier edition was the first vega
based product but you had to pay like
1500 1500 bucks for it when it first
launched vega 20 is gonna have 32 gigs
of HP m to memory good lord
which is which is pretty insane but who
knows what AMD is planning and charging
for there their instinct products so
we'll have to see if this is something
that we might actually be able to
purchase reasonably feasibly from alina
or if it's just something that you know
gamers nexus is gonna buy and like to
other people and and test it and wanna
keep them back here are these benchmarks
for this card no one will buy maybe
eventually it will trickle down to like
real real products like a bigger
what's twice 50 things hard one hundred
and twelve hundred and twelve Vega
hundred and twelve and vega 128 probably
but the 3d mark score here is 21,000 126
graphics core you can see all the scores
listed here it's it's relatively
impressive numbers but of course these
are early results and these are leaked
and the main confirmation that they have
that is vegas wanting to see a device ID
which is six six a zero which is
confirmed being the biggest when apart
from linux display driver patch
further demonstrating that this might
actually possibly be legit information
is this tweet by AMD which says 790
meter Radeon instinct product for
machine learning is running in our labs
with the internet-connected asterisk and
we forgot to unplug it for the internet
before running 3d mark shit so someone
got fired yeah yeah yeah
someone maybe or maybe it was
intentional maybe maybe they wanted
people to know
sneaky organically score yeah all right
let's move on to our next segment which
is tales from space oh wait I change
that tales from very spacious tales from
space thanks a cool even though this one
in a while what's what's up with space
lately I have it's all tales from space
I like to talk about space news because
what's going on because it's it's
exciting and it it's a final frontier
inspirational to talk about it mankind
reaching beyond the boundaries of itself
yes anyway
I talk a lot about and we've talked a
decent amount abouts about space X you
can in tales from space we're gonna talk
a little bit about Blue Origin here Blue
Origin they successfully launched and
landed a new Shepard rockets it's a new
gaming now I want to be clear here that
the Shepard rocket is a reusable rocket
that Blue Origin has been developing and
this is not the first time that they
have reused a Blue Origin rocket blue
Origin's just like another space x-ray
Blue Origin is Jethro's bezos's SpaceX
Jeff Jeff Bezos moves us from Amazon
he's like I have a hundred eighty 1
billion dollars
I wanna do space stuff to do space stuff
big boy yeah so the cool thing here is
the continuation of this trend of like
making reusable rockets in order to make
space travel more affordable more
cost-effective
and they were able to successfully
relaunch and conduct another test
flights of the new Shepherd rocket and
this rocket was launched for the second
time so eighth test flight of new
Shepherd the first test flight that they
did back three years or so ago in 2015
failed it crashed boom the second test
that they did in November 2015 was
successful and then they were able to
successfully relaunch that rocket four
more times
so they got five uses out of that one
this rocket here they've already
previously launched in December 2017 and
this makes their eighth launch of the
new Shepherd in total and their second
launch of this specific one the new
Shepherd is this is I look there there's
there's a picture of the flight path
where'd that go oh the flight dummy I
wanted to show this flight dummy this
flight
it lifts on our separation there's a
capsule so that's what's gonna happen
they're trying to take people they want
to do commercial space flight so it's a
more fun yeah for people for space
tourism Disneyland it's an 11 minute
it's an 11 minute flight it lifts off it
separates you're in the capsule and you
go up into space for a little bit the
capsule the capsule comes back down and
has some parachutes that let it float
back down whereas the actual booster has
a powered descent so it can land base is
trying to go to Mars in blue Blue Origin
is trying to do it for you are rich
people not for the walls to go into
space someone said it looks like a
flying penis yeah I think that's what
this is right now is that like SpaceX
and Blue Origin are just comparing penis
size more on that with their rockets
more on that in our next just a
dick-measuring in that sense a story I'm
Shirley with dick shaped rockets who has
the biggest coolest baddest penis shaped
rocket oh there's a t-minus in the top I
should be paying attention to that
big-ass penis in the air
team is traveling it unguarded yes
here's the countdown with 20 seconds
left to go blue steel penis so because
because they're testing this for future
use with human spaceflight they're
trying to they're trying to test this to
make sure they can bring people up in
there they're Manny with a crash dummy
which is named mannequin Skywalker do
you get just wanted to bring that up
because it's funny I dig it
oh it's ignition we have ignition and
it's about to liftoff sis so exciting so
powerful Hey
yeah they apart from Anakin Skywalker
they've also included a sensor sweets in
the capsule to collect data on pressure
noise and environments there's also a
Schmidt space communicator which is
designed to provide Wi-Fi to commercial
space customers so when you when you get
launched up in your Blue Origin you can
tweet about a new Shepard you can make
sure that you're tweeting about it the
whole time paying attention to like your
cell phone and taking pictures rather
than enjoying your brief the limit 11
minutes it's basic flight into a capsule
he probably paid like tens of thousands
of dollars for but hey don't talk bad on
those people that much because people
like us who could never afford something
like that gets a little vicariously
through those idiots who are live
streaming on periscope you're making the
sacrifice so that you can yes share your
experience on Twitter or whatever live
feed or something like that there's that
their stupidity is is our game well let
them be stereo Cal let them be stupid so
long story short this is a successful
test they were able to detach the
capsule and recover the racket very
exciting Blue Origin has also recently
shown some designs for a new Glenn
rocket so successor to this one they're
going to start testing that in 2020 and
they're planning the first crewed
flights for new Shepard later this year
with the the hope of actually starting
to to take people's money and send them
into space in 2019 next year does it say
how much space I don't think so I don't
I don't
they've said it's also is 11 minutes in
space or 11 minutes for the total flight
which means you'd only be in space for
like a minute and then like the rest of
the time of the 11 11 minutes is getting
there and descending well if you look at
this that's it's an 11 minute flight
because see this is this is nine minutes
and 30 seconds after literally just
there for like a minute and it's coming
it's that it's this is less than 11
minutes Wow right yeah yeah obviously
that's gonna I mean I feel like the
trips already over by now this is like
they should come as soon as you start
ascending back to earth then it's no
more fun like oh we're going back home
yeah
party's over like cut the time off right
when you're leaving space that's when
the fun ends no one's me like and then
and then you land in like the middle of
some like desert you know how long if I
can get backs probably hundred degrees
probably thirsty I haven't you know jerk
utilize this probably like 11 minutes
like some desert like Raiders that come
along and rob you and all that it's all
part of the experience see that'd be
awesome
you land back at your thing will you
land back on the earth in the middle in
the middle of some simulation that like
you know in the limits of your complex
government collapses oh the chaos and
now it's like some book of Eli's yeah
exactly
that would be worth it totally all right
next up on tales from space boeing has
said that the falcon heavy rocket is too
small
see it's a dick measuring contest your
dick is too small
Boeing says Boeing's like finally just
put the headlines for what they are
Boeing claims SpaceX is dick is not as
big as they're basically a direct insult
to Elon Musk's man
dick measuring contest man space has
just has become just with social media
has just become a dick measuring contest
and I love it
exactly I'm the biggest dick so the
falcon heavy them all discussed before
takes three fucking nines and straps
them together
according to boeing is too small and
can't meet nasa's deep space needs deep
this is according to a new website that
boeing put up called watch s fly now
they created this to promote their
aerospace industry and specifically what
they're working on right now is the sls
the Space Launch System this is a
picture of the rocket that's in
development
once the Boeing builds SLS is
operational says Boeing it will be the
most powerful rocket ever built that's
actually not true will tell you it will
tell you why it well I guess it will be
if you go like 10 or 15 years into the
future to what their ultimate plans are
with it but as their intentions the most
powerful rocket ever built right now is
the Saturn 5 from the 1960s and 1970s it
was used in the Apollo program that
could lift 118 metric tons into
low-earth orbit now the initial
configuration of the SLS booster that
they're working on right now will be
able to lift 70 tons to low Earth orbit
which is about 50 tons less than 118
that the Saturn 5 can do it is however
about six tons more than the Falcon
Heavy the Falcon Heavy can do 64 so 64
tons for the fog and heavy 70 tons for
the SLS booster which doesn't seem like
that much of a difference but it should
also point it be pointed out that the
SLS will have a more powerful up upper
stage which will enable it to send more
mass into deep space so that part at the
end after they get past low-earth orbit
to where they need to break further
beyond that and send something further
out it might have better capabilities
for that NASA also as mentioned has
plans to upgrade the SLS it's a it's a
multi multiple fees
to this project beyond this the 70-ton
lift version that they have going on
there is a hundred and five tonne lift
configuration but that won't happen
until the mid-2020s
at the earliest and it will probably
cost several billion dollars and nasa is
funded by the US government's it's weird
taxes I won't continue down that line
no but that's a whole that's a whole
rabbit hole that we have yet to yes to
adventure into now beyond that 105 ton
configuration which sounds pretty badass
but also pretty far off there is the
final form of the SLS rocket which will
be able to lift a hundred thirty metric
tons final fom the most powerful rocket
ever pseudo super slam but there's no
real timetable or promise of when that
was yeah presumably you know after they
get billions of dollars to get to Boeing
or whatever
in the meantime beyond the plans for the
SLS in the future and this is what the
articles pointing out is that if if
Boeing really wants to come out with
this website that's like SpaceX doesn't
have the power and the wreck it's not
good enough and this is based on what we
think we're going to do in the next five
ten or fifteen years that you should
also give space X and and and Blue
Origin credit because they're also
working on the big fuckin rocket which
is just funny to say that big fucking
rocket yeah the big Falcon rocket if you
say it quickly enough and I don't know
too much about the specs for that but
it's presumably a large larger than the
Falcon nine of the Falcon Heavy and Blue
Origin has also proposed a new Armstrong
booster which also just bigger and
better but not much details beyond that
so the space race continues says that's
good to have competition in this market
yes one last story here's four tails
from space and that is a new galactic
map which is should able to show you the
position and brightness of 1.7 billion
stars here's here's a picture of it but
you can also go down here to this
3/6 to youtube video ooh it's a 360
video so you can click and drag is that
of real space yes is an actual picture
of looking at space right now maybe not
right now this is what's Gaia Gaia
so Gaia is a probe I believe that's what
it would be classified as a probe it was
launched by the ESA the European Space
Agency so um this update was just last
week on April 25th they unveiled this
new highly detailed sky map of the Milky
Way galaxy showcases the brightness and
position of nearly 1.7 billion stars
this is the most comprehensive catalog
of stars to date it includes precise
details about many stars distances
movements and colors and it was built
with data from the ESA is Gaia
spacecraft which was launched back in 20
2013 and is currently 1 million miles
from Earth it continuously scans the sky
with two telescopes it rotates once
every six hours
kind of like me and it Maps one big
circle of the sky it takes about two
months to get to cover the entire sky
and then it does it again in order to
update position and and that kind of
thing by mapping this star's color
brightness and movement it can provide
information on the Stars composition
distance whether it's moving towards or
away from us which is referred to as the
radial velocity of the scart star
they've been able to get that for about
700 thousand stars of the 1.7 billion
that have done that but above all the
new guy a map will help astronomers
piece together the history of the Milky
Way's formation it's thought that our
galaxy grew into its current form after
merging with much smaller galaxies
billions of years ago the guy mission is
planned to last for five years so which
I'm not actually hundred percent sure
about because it launched in 2013 and
the missions supposed to last for five
years so that would be like this year
yeah it's over but it also says that
it's been mapping for 22 months so 22
months ago wasn't five years ago no that
was closer to two years ago yeah so yeah
after 14 months of mapping it mapped 1.1
billion stars after 22 months of that
being at math 1.7 billion stars so the
longer it has time to map the stars the
more stars that gathers information on
and adds to its database but however
long that five-year period lasts whether
it's ending now or ending three years
from now they are hoping to extend the
mission for an additional five years
afterwards so that's pretty cool
hopefully we'll be getting more data
from Gaia so that's that's pretty good
all that lighting that in this photo is
from stars correct yeah these are all
stars so that means there's an absence
of stars in this like sort of middle
sector like where it becomes black well
yeah because it's looking at the Milky
Way right so oh that's one of the things
so like down here you can see like this
stuff down here these are the galaxies
buzzer other guy yeah that's crazy
apart apart from like a little
neighborhood apart 1.7 billion stars
it's also mapped half a million distant
galaxies that are really far away as
well as 14,000 asteroids that are much
closer that are in our solar system so
giving us more information about that so
that we can do the what is the one where
we have to send the crew of people up to
to kill the asteroid that's about to run
at earth deep impact or Armageddon
either one pick cool all right so there
we go
tales from space has now concluded
retweet now we are going to end my half
of the show with playing video games use
the the basic concept is that we used to
do after parties after our live show and
then we realized that that was tiring
and it's and we didn't always do it but
now we're gonna play video games and I'm
not sure if it's actually gonna work cuz
it's been a while
should I read some donations yeah in the
meantime while I see if I can get this
up and running sure I do have a couple
donations left over or just one donation
leftover from my half this is from dust
eh 99-81 $5 risin 5 1500 X coolermaster
a oh that's in gigabytes of RAM GTX 1066
gigabytes
should I go 2600 or 2700 I would go with
the 2700 Oh our our stream just a video
oh I'd go with a 2700 I don't think this
2600 would be a massive upgrade or as
big of an upgrade as the 2700 I have
been said in a recent in my X 470 versus
X 370 video that if you had a risin 3 or
Rison 5 fixed first gen parts the only
worthy upgrade would be going to rise in
7 seconds so a second sticking to my
guns there I would go for the 2700 dusty
thank you very much for your donation
and then pulse half bazinga X $100 from
bazinga thank oh my god you fear here is
your 100 if the I 979 80 X and I'm
guessing human he means 79 80 XC and
thread Ripper were the same price would
you still go for the thread Ripper
rampage 6 extreme if Intel which
motherboard for thread River Kwai I like
Asus if they were the same price 1950 X
79 AD XE no the same price because it
has faster better performance it's got a
better single single core performance
better than three pairs so yeah if if
money is no object
then 79 80 ex and ex2 nature board will
you go if you went forever um
I'd go with Asus I'll go with an Asus
board or maybe an as rock board those
are my two favorites 399 Taichi from a
track which is actually a micro ATX
motherboard but has all the bells and
whistles and has been pretty stable
right now
it's it's crazy gta5 just loves to lock
up the the webcam for some reason really
I can refresh the capture ah that's
really weird pup Shepard $5 I am here
wags wags have fun hey pup thanks Pat
wags wags back teaser Chris Wesley $20
have an AMD 1632 gigs juice no memory
nvme samsung SSD 960 Evo 250 gigs and 2
more miscues hopping private engage that
the burps is this great for video
editing sure to upgrade more you have
been arisin 5 1600 your 3 2 gigs of G
still memory is fantastic for everything
the nvme storage is gonna serve you very
well for editing I'd say your
shortcoming here is the CPU with only
having a risin 5 1600 I would want 8
core 16 threads in my primary editing
system if I could muster it budget wise
and a GTX 1063 gig version 3 gig card I
would I'd like to see that up to a 1070
a gtx 1070 would be smooth sailin for
video editing you can definitely get by
on G on a GTX 1063 gig but I would say a
1070 would be a worthy upgrade if you
were editing often and it was part of
your daily workflow so thank you very
much Chris for that donation fat guy fun
time $5 big fan from fat guy funtime
Paul I started streaming after watching
your channel oh thanks bro keep up the
good work man thank you thank you for
getting inspired fat guy to stream I'm
very I'm happy about that
that makes me it makes me happy good
thank you thank you very much red guy
Jager G $5 I have a 6600 K with a be 150
motherboard bought the motherboard
before I was aware of the ability to
overclock
350 he won't should I buy a z170 or save
an upgrade to Z 370 if you're gonna
upgrade then upgrade to the latest
platform is usually what I recommend if
you're on an older platform existing
then just stick with that because it's
probably good enough but if you're gonna
buy something new go with the latest and
greatest so I would suggest the Aussie
370 if you wanted a sixty six sixty six
hundred K but you also have to weigh in
how much that's really gonna benefit you
to overclock your sixty six hundred K if
it's gonna require you to like redo your
whole system it's gonna take you know a
few hours to pop in that motherboard
plus you know a couple hundred dollars
to buy that motherboard you have to
decide is the workload that you're doing
very CPU bound we're having a three to
four 500 megahertz overclock is really
gonna benefit you to to to make the
money worth it that's that's gonna have
to be something that you figure out for
yourself but yeah it goes Z 370 if you
did it end up deciding to upgrade over Z
170 for sure Chris Wesley 10 bucks by
the way Jagr though one last thing to
mention is there's been rumors of a Z
390 because Z 370 had limitations for
sure because you can look at like the HD
70 that just come out you get USB 3.1
you get well those you get a tattoo that
11ac that's built-in that doesn't that's
not part of the chipset natively with C
370 so there's expected to be a
successor to it and we're not sure if
that's if if there's also an eight core
CPU that launches what kind of
compatibility requirements will be there
that kind of thing so yeah maybe wait
for Z 390 to see what is available it
might be worth it because it's May 1st
right now and beginning of June yeah
beginning of June is when Computex
happens so it's gonna be any big
launches coming up it might be worth it
to wait and see what happens they yeah
never never buy hardware a month before
Computex yeah it's pretty excellent
Chris Wesley $10 by the way I love you
guys to the moon and back we love you to
Jupiter and back which is further
meaning we love you more than you love
us so get on our level and thank you
very much for the donation it's very
true mr. Chris Wesley oh gosh it froze
again b67 30 nose and 37 cents sorry one
sec I'll fix it do you stop or can you
- I mean they can probably hear me they
can probably hear a little keep talking
MB 6739 37 cents palm glad to see you
getting back into the swing of things
content wise and they hope that 1
million subscribers happens for you soon
Cheers
thank you sir it will that you have not
been slowing down momentum you're still
gaining subscribers I look I look at
your social blade statistics from time
to time and you are still gaining
subscribers like every other channel and
it's it's just it's literally just a
matter of time before you hit one mill
before before we're all in the mint the
mill in above Club and I like I don't
know what that means I need to join that
Club I don't know what that means I
don't have to ask J he's been in it for
a while I'd be like what kind of perks
do you get in the one mill Club the
ultimate benefits people just like you
know your system is more than capable to
handle streaming and gta5 yeah it's I
know that you move okay no are you
running at 4k no I ever feeling like
that needs a system restart or something
like wouldn't NZ good more value that
might be there are frustrated if I want
to keep going here with NZ Odin for the
5 GBP Congrats on hitting nearly went
760 thousand subs Paul hehe oh I'm very
close spec list that he's very close
dust eh 1991 $5 risin 1500 X overclocked
to 3.9 gigahertz with the coolermaster
AO 16 gigs of 3200 RAM GTX wait shit oh
wait this is a repeat sorry that's a
repeat Omar Motamedi $5 in 1605 point 69
euros had to use VPN to send a super
shot because it doesn't work in Egypt oh
well hello hello - I just bought the bit
winzip or who you recently took forever
to arrive but worth it yes it definitely
is thank you for saying that mr. Omar
so well we appreciate you and your
comment from Egypt hope all is good
they're just in w10 Canadians I think
the dog wants treats go by the doctor
treats the dog is the hero's treat
number one treat is his balls so and he
has those 24/7 so I think hero's doing
just fine I'm sure
treats otherwise look at the slideshow
that I'm putting out holy shit
Wow alright but lucky for you I have a
few more donations to go over well you
get that shit straightened out we have
Joseph and Rica's $4.99 so what would be
better for 2k gaming no streaming the
Intel 8700 K or the AMD 2700 X I would
go 2700 X you get two more course for
more threads and gamers Nexus has
already shown that you can have a better
streaming experience with the 2700 x
over in 8700 k both for the streamer and
particularly the end user so you will
potentially be able to up your bitrate
settings and your streaming settings
while still maintaining higher frame
rates with an 87 I'm sorry with a 2700 X
that is the takeaway that I've gotten so
far Darryl may $5 Intel a smart timing
is everything
astute observation mr. Darryl and I
would have to be inclined to agree with
you on that I thank you very much for
the donation Joshua Kraft $5 guys spread
the love to both channels with the risin
upgrade ok I can't tell you guys how
smooth my actual gameplay experiences
this from what you everyone's actually
home because I can see what everyone is
actually singing over there and it's not
it's not pretty
alright let's even on next I feel like
even on exploit it doesn't preview
exactly what your viewers gonna see but
Joshua Kraft $5 got to spread the love
to both channels but with the rising
upgrade should I upgrade to the x4 70
chipset have the asus hero 6 if yes what
motherboard I would stick to your same
motherboard there's really no difference
I've already tested x4 70 vs x3 70 in a
recent video that I posted on launch day
for second gen risin and there was no
performance difference right now no
performance difference stick with your
Asus hero v r6 and if you are still so
inclined to upgrade then I don't know go
with any zeus board go with an as rock
board I don't know TV check $10 oh wait
it's David Jackson that's a quite a
rocky my do record can you imagine that
a rocket
I can carry well over 20 metric ton of
the baby oil into space
what that's a rack of baby all you oh
he's talking about their egg from 20
metric ton of baby oil in the spaceship
in the space space environment that's a
rapper rocket fear baby that's
interesting concept to have that much
baby oil put into space I'm sure you can
do a lot with that there the
possibilities seem endless and my brain
my imagination just runs rampant with
this with this concept but maybe you
will have to you know put that into
actual testing once Paul and I sign up
for the the blue what is the blue blue
blue horizon blue what's the Jeff basis
is a Blue Origin the Blue Origin space
experience maybe Paul and I will do that
one day for a YouTube vlog and we'll
bring some baby oil into space and test
it for you firsthand I'm looking forward
to that I'm sure that's gonna happen at
some point it's just a matter of time
zip lock $5 why is Kyle not wearing his
ring this time because I am allergic to
metal all kinds of metal I learned is
like Magneto
I'm like magneto but I have retarded
superpowers instead of awesome ones so
yeah I do like start shedding skin and I
get I breakout and I'm if you ever want
like metal is my kryptonite if you ever
see me at a LAN or something or at some
event and you you don't like me just
throw a piece of metal at me you know
I'll probably disintegrate into dust
but yeah I'm starting I'm trying to like
work on like maybe coating the inside of
the ring with like I don't know nail
polish remover or something with some
kind of layer to create a separation
between my skin and the metal because I
don't respond well to it Trinity Sloan
$5 what's your favorite beer to drink
casually and favorite to get drunk you
guys Rock I think you can get drunk on
any beer I don't think anyone has a
preference on what kind of beer they
liked
drunk on usually it's like shots or
something today I'm we're drinking
downtown Brad to drink casually I do
enjoy a nice brown brown ale like what
we're drinking today or sometimes a
solid like German Pilsner is good casual
beers yeah like lighter beers if you're
just drinking to drink during the day de
beers you know like lighter music I feel
like the lighter the beer the the more
early on in the day you can drink the
darker the beer gets that I usually
reserve that for later at night more
heavy drinking you know more full
filling filling drinks I reserved for
the eat the evening or late evening
stouts and porters I'll reserved for
late at night but during the day and the
summer or whatever just a refreshing
beverage I'll go for a lighter drink
like a lager or a pilsner you can't
decide
there's always bud ice there is always
but ice or you know Mickey's you can do
natty ice if you're feeling desperate
you could do Old English if you're
feeling homeless or the OE there's a lot
of options out there we used to do a
mixture called blood juice ooh that
sounds terrible what happens if I google
blood juice I don't want to know Trinity
Sloan $5 what's your favorite beer to
drink no way that's the same one okay
something she five dollars here's
another five Doris you guys are the
absolute best live stream out there
someday I'll get in on Pitt my PC good
it submit bra much love 90 wags
Thank You EDA blood juice is full-on
like Mickey's just the recipe right here
on the tryin packet of an urban
dictionary it sounds terrible so the way
blood juice works
Mickey's malt liquor works you can also
use Old English like like a ghetto for
tea is what you're really liqueur yeah
by the way this is only recommended for
like dudes sewer whore livin single I
want to say 22 or 23 and you just want
to get hammered and you don't care about
so you take you take you take the 40 and
you're gonna drink about a fifth to a
quarter of it with the OE we would drink
it down to the top of the label
then you take a packet I forget what do
we do first
I think we did the night train first so
you get the bottle of night train if
you're not familiar with night train if
you've ever seen a wino with a with a
paper bag they probably have night train
in it it's it's like really horrible
wine but it's like 20% or 30% night
train that's what that is
so you pour it before the night train in
to refill the what you drink down
so we're boodle that up and then you get
your packet of cherry kool-aid you
definitely want the red the cherry
kool-aid dump that in and then when you
we need to this isn't a 40 but when you
dump the kool-aid and it's immediately
in a physics so you're gonna need to cap
it right that's why oh he works good
because he can screw the cap back on so
getting a type of beer that you get a
cap back on you do that cap it and then
put it in the freezer why do you know so
much about this cuz my friends used to
just have a just they were blood juice
kind of like he was really like super
into blue blood juice he wanted to do
this because what are these things and
you just you would just be a knight
lately right you'd be pretty destroyed
so anyway pop it in the freezer for like
15 minutes and then when you open it up
again it shouldn't explode everywhere
although you should still be kind of be
careful of that and then you drink it
and the weird thing is like you have
this horrible beer and this horrible
wine and like kool-aid and it makes it
taste like slightly sweet but it's
actually a pretty palatable blood juice
all right well I'll have to try that
sometime maybe I'll try it tonight yeah
really
like I said I like I said this is
degenerating stuff so like oh yeah if
only if you're it definitely sounds like
rage juice you're young and you have
itwe haven't really had that much of an
impact your spirit yes and you actually
I feel bad for telling people about that
it's the modern day for local Robert
Cavinder the third five dollars I'm
doing the buildin a traveler P I know
lol I'm a huge Mass Effect fan NZXT air
fans or Corsair light loops for
the system additional five hundred
percent improvement on air I don't think
so
I don't know it's a matter of preference
I feel like both of those fans are
pretty good NZXT airs have the you know
I think with the airs you're gonna get
more custom ability customizability but
especially if you like you Plus yeah I
need to connect that to a hue plus and
they're digital and everything so that's
cool but there's a lot of extra cables
that you need to run I realize that when
setting up my air system that I did yeah
it's there's a lot of cabling that goes
on so getting it set up exactly how you
want takes more work yeah so the light
loops might be a little bit simpler for
you but yeah just go go with them if you
if you want fancier LEDs but a little
bit more work with the installation go
with the air yeah and keep a little bit
simpler to then go with the Corsair
Chris Wesley five dollars twenty six
hundred X or 1600 X 2600 X cuz it's
