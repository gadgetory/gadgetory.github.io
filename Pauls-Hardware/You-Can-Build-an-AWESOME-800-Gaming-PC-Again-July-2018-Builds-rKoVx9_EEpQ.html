ddr4 memory gives you blazing fast speed
and dynamic multi zone RGB lighting with
ten ultra-bright LEDs per module
customization options are practically
endless with the corsair IQ software
package and they're available with black
or white heat spreaders find out more
about the Corsair Vengeance RGB pro
series via the sponsor link in the
description what's up guys welcome back
to Pauls hardware this is my monthly
builds video for July 2018 I usually do
this series every month although I
haven't been as consistent this year but
I'm getting back into it because GPU
prices are recovering and today I have
two system builds for you guys and that
also builds that I really feel like if I
had a friend come to me and say hey I've
got 800 bucks to build a computer with
what would you choose or I have $1,000
to build a computer with what would you
choose these are the parts that I would
choose for them right now now quick
disclaimer for anyone who sees builds in
the title of this video and is actually
looking for me to build something I'm
not doing that today I'm just going over
parts lists but check out my builds
playlist in the description if you want
to see some actual construction of
systems because I do that pretty
regularly also straw polls if you guys
want to give me feedback on what builds
you want to see in August please feel
free to also check the link in the
description and go ahead and vote on
these and let me know what your choice
would be now last time I did this was
which is actually in April May I asked
what builds you wanted to see in June I
didn't do my monthly builds video in
June because of Computex and other
things but I'm still gonna go buy this
straw poll and what most people wanted
to see was an 800 dollar sweet pop sweet
spot PC if GPU and ram presses settle
down GPU prices have settled out a lot
ram prices have a bit they're still
coming down hopefully we'll see them
even reduced further but let's get right
into it with the first build this is the
800 dollar sweet spot gaming PC build
for July and I'm using PC part picker to
go over these lists so links to the full
lists are also of course in the
description now the media of building
your own gaming PC is you can sort of
swap parts in and out as you choose so
for some of these parts I'm gonna say
here's what you should get and for some
of these I'm going to say here are some
guidelines to help you choose a part
that's similar to what I've got here but
if you look at the final price down here
seven hundred and eighty eight dollars
and 91 cents is what we are down to and
since this is a reasonable budget but
still
budget PC with an $800 top price I had
to use some of my
tricks in order to get under that price
while still giving you guys an awesome
parts list that will be a very powerful
system so I am using Mellon rebates for
this price so bear that in mind
I'm also only going with eight gigs of
memory for this build but I will give
you solutions to upgrade it to 16 gigs
if you choose and it's also somewhat
limited on storage it's only got a 240
gig SSD which you'll probably run out of
space with in the long term so I
recommend as I've done many times in the
past finding an old computer with maybe
a 500 gig one terabyte maybe 2 terabyte
hard drive in it grab that hard drive
reformat it and then install it in this
system to give yourself some mass
storage if you don't have that available
consider an extra 40 bucks or so to get
a mechanical storage drive in here so
you make sure you have all the room you
need for your Steam games and anything
else you might want to load up on here
let's go over the actual parts this is
an AMD build because the am4 platform
right now with x3 70 and x2 470
motherboards available I just feel like
is the most flexible and again it gives
you the most bang for your buck so Rison
5 1600 with an x3 70 motherboard eight
gigs of memory 240 gig SSD and rx 588
gig for oh my gosh like about the retail
price the heck is going on this is crazy
a fan Tech's Eclipse case for only $60
and a corsair 650 watt power supply that
has all black cables now the processor
is exciting just because it's a 6 core
12 thread processor and you can get them
for a hundred and sixty dollars right
now these have come way down in price
since risin 2nd generation has launched
but you don't necessarily need rise in
2nd generation they're not that much
faster it's very incremental of an
update so rise in 1st generation you can
still get and the prices are very
reasonable so with this you get a 3.6
gigahertz turbo boost it is unlocked so
you can't overclock it a bit more and
one of the things I do like has got is
it's got an included cooler the race
spire 95 watt which is the bigger one
it's a little bit beefier so that does
provide adequate cooling although you
might want to upgrade it in the future
but we'll leave that for a future
potential upgrade now the motherboard I
chose as an as Drakh x3 70 killer SLI AC
it's a full sized ATX motherboard this
is a full sized ATX build because it
gives you a little bit more flexibility
with parts you choose as well as a
little bit more ease of actual building
if you're a first-time builder for exam
and this motherboard is a very good set
of features for only about 110 dollars
if again you apply the mail-in rebate
from new egg
now aesthetically it may or may not
please you it's got a big old K in the
middle but other than that a pretty
black-and-white color scheme and a few
reasons I chose this board you can get
onto this platform with like a be 350 or
the upcoming be 450 motherboards for a
bit cheaper than this but for 110
dollars you get the X 370 chipset which
does provide you the capability of doing
two-way graphics cards in the future if
you want you're probably not going to do
that but the reasons I chose this
motherboard we're a bit more specific I
wanted the motherboard to have USB 3.1
gen2 which this has I wanted to they
have 802 dot 11 AC Wi-Fi which this has
and that is not a huge requirement you
can add 802 LM an AC Wi-Fi to any of
these other motherboards so if you find
another motherboard in this price range
with the same set of features that you
like a little bit better whether it's
aesthetics or build quality or just some
feature that you feel like you really
need to have you can always add 802 that
11 AC Wi-Fi in the future but again for
a hundred and ten bucks I feel like it's
a nice feature set
this has Tom's Hardware editor
recommended reward award and it's also
got pretty decent power delivery so if
you do happen to be overclocking in the
future it's got the power delivery for
it as well as a bit of cooling on there
which you are going to want if you
overclock after you're building a rising
system that once you've chosen your
motherboard I highly recommend going
over to your motherboard support page go
to the memory qvl the memory support
lists and they'll typically for this
have an old one and then a new one
that's updated for Raven Ridge we're
using a first gen rising processor so
we're looking at the knots Raven Ridge
one and then here you can choose
different memory manufacturers and try
to figure out some memory that will work
with it because getting higher speed
memory that is also compatible with
Rison it's pretty important g.skill
crucial different vendors have different
memory sets that have been tested but
all that is to say you can go through
those lists find memory that you know
will work use the actual module SKU name
to search the memory that you will find
and then hopefully you can find memory
that is functional and not terribly
expensive I chose for this build this 82
kits of XP gmx d-10 memory which this
memory kit is not specifically listed on
the compatibility page but it is the
same
exact memory Brandon timings as some of
the SKUs that are listed as compatible
and I double-checked some of the reviews
to make sure that this should just work
and plug in with your arisin CPU it is
three thousand speed memory and I
recommend three thousand speed or faster
for arisin and this should run it either
three thousand or 2933 if you go and
plug in the XMP settings and it's $100
for an eight gig kits at Amazon which is
better than it has been previously but
you can actually get a little bit more
memory for your money money if you're
willing to spend a little bit more and
get a 16 gig kit but more on that in
just a minute our SSD is the SSD plus
from SanDisk I've used this multiple
times in the past it's a solid SSD it's
even got a nice black and a red color
scheme and it's available for 54 bucks
and Amazon that's a solid entry-level
price for an SSD and that's where it
should be moving on to graphics card
here I decided to go with the rx 580 and
this is pretty much just sorted by the
cheapest one and you should maybe double
check which rx5 880 are getting if
you're doing this parametric filter
sorting option this one is the msi which
has an aftermarket cooling solution it
is black and red and so it's not going
to match quite as well with our black
and white color scheme for the rest of
the build but it'll work and take we're
on a budget build so the color
coordination was a little bit less of a
concern I'm just excited you can
actually get rx 588 gigs which is very
solid cards for around 250 260 dollars
for our case we have the fantex Eclipse
P 400 and this is a $60 case at least
right now with a $10 million rebate
usually costs about $80 so if this case
doesn't exactly you know do it for you
then definitely check other 60 $70 case
options because there's tons of them out
there I just like this one because it's
black and whites at least this
particular model that's on sale so it
will match the black and white
motherboard decently so it's got a
little bit of RGB in there it's got
tempered glass it's got a painting
interior so it's a solid case especially
for $60 and that reduced price it's
available on other color combinations
too but I believe right now if you want
this do it from new egg you got to get
it in whites but a I think again that
one that's the one that'll match so the
p400 solid little case from fantex
finally we need a power supply and here
actually I'd chosen a different one
yesterday but the sale went away on it
so I've got the course
CX 2017 version 650 watt 80 plus bronze
rated power supply it's not modular but
it does have all black cables and that's
really kind of what I was going for
other than 80 plus bronze reading I
wanted 550 to 650 watts and the
all-black cables is gonna make sure that
you don't get the nasty ketchup and
mustard stuff going on when you call it
especially since you've got that
tempered glass side window to look
through and that's my builds for $800
that I would recommend right now I
really like it because it's a high-end
gaming PC it's also got a 6 core CPU so
not only can you game with it but if you
wanted to do something like video
editing or gaming and streaming at the
same time it would totally be able to do
that too but I did mention that I cut
some corners with this build so for
$1000 you can do a couple upgrades it'll
give you a much better gaming
performance and also give you a lot more
memory to work with because I think with
this $800 version of thing you're going
to be limited on most is going to be
that memory so here is the $1000 version
of this build with a gtx 1070 upgrade as
well as a memory upgrade and if you look
at the list everything else is pretty
much exactly the same same processor
same motherboard same SSD same case and
same power supply 988 dollars and 82
cents is the price total here on PC part
picker so let's just quickly go over the
updated different parts this is
basically the same memory kits but it's
available in the 16 gig 2 by 8 instead
of 2 by 4 and it's 160 dollars so you
know that that first kit was 99 double
the memory for $60 more so you are
getting more gigs per dollar here with
this updated kit of course you're
spending 60 bucks more so not quite
gonna stay with the $800 price limit if
you're going with this kit with that
first bill but you can use of course
this kit with that initial first build
too if you wanted to so if you just
wanted to upgrade this you totally could
next for a video card I wanted a gtx
1070 i was also looking at 1070 TI's
and gtx 1080s 1070 is or 450 bucks 10
80s you can get for $500 so again just
to keep the price reasonable I went with
the 1070 which you can get for four
hundred ten dollars I'm using a
parametric filter again with the PC part
picker list here so it's just gonna
choose the cheapest
gtx 1070 that's out there but I would
recommend you reality check that list so
like if you go over here the cheapest
one is a ten seventy arrow which you
know there's a perfectly adequate gtx
1070 but it's a smaller one with a
single fan that's not gonna cool quite
as quite as well might not be able to
run at higher frequencies for quite as
long so for three bucks more right now
at amazon you can get the ten seventy
eight gig from msi which is a larger
card larger cooler to fans it's also
black and white so this would totally
match with the build so i think i would
go with this one over that mini version
if you're choosing between the two and
that's pretty much wraps it up for the
$800 and thousand dollar builds but a
couple other things to mention before I
leave because there are potentially
other upgrades that you guys might want
to consider now the air cooling I think
is one thing that you might dive into
but honestly the race spire does a
perfectly adequate job so let's save
that for later for now I think apart
from the memory these are the other
things that I would consider an upgrade
for the SSD already mentioned might be a
little small at 240 gigs upgrading to a
480 gig SSD you can do that and get
yourself one for less than $100 right
now actually as low as 80 if you're
willing to go with some of these more
budget ones these might not be quite as
fast but they're still SSDs so they're
still gonna be fast but like the ADATA
xpg or the SanDisk SSD plus here for 100
bucks that would give you a nice boost
in base storage and then your cpu of
course one of the very nice things about
a m4 is that you can upgrade from a four
core to a six core to an eight core on
the same platform that rise in five 1600
at 160 dollars is is just a really nice
deal for six cores for 160 dollars you
can't get the 2600 which is the second
generation version of that for about
thirty dollars more but honestly I think
it's worth it just to stick with the
1600 if you are gonna upgrade the Rison
7 1700 for 220 dollars jumps you up to
eight cores and sixteen thread so if you
really are considering gaming and
streaming at the same time or in
particular video editing that eight core
I think would be a great option for you
but guys those are my builds for July
2018 of course links to all the parts
are down in the video description so
check those out if you have a
already definitely at the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video and
subscribe to my channel for more tech
content coming at you very soon
including the upcoming Riptide
water-cooled system build which I'm
really looking forward to if only it
would cool off a little bit in
California so I can work out in the
garage in the afternoon without it
getting too hot but I'm getting
distracted so thanks again for watching
guys we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
