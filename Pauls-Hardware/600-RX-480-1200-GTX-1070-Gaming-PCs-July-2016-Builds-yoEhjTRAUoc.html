builds video for July 2016 I get asked
all the time for me to look at people's
parts lists or to give them builds so
that they can build a system so this is
my response to that each month I do two
parts lists for computer builds these
are all based on your votes and your
feedback from months past so I actually
didn't do this for June because I was a
Computex last one was back in May and
the results from that straw poll have
come in although I had to make that
strap a little bit more vague so here
are the results I was just asking what
are people more excited about because
again I there was parts that were not
out yet at that time anyway everyone was
really excited for in videos new GPUs
back at that point in time I also asked
about AMD's new radeon gpus which
happens to be the RX 480 which we know
now I think there was less excitement
about it at that point in time but I
think now it's gotten a little bit more
exciting so for today's video I'm gonna
be doing two builds based on the AMD R X
480 which is a $600 build as well so
$1200 build based on the nvidia gtx 1070
specifically the msi version of that
also a couple changes for this month one
is that i'm not live streaming this in
case you didn't notice they were always
just very short when i livestream them
and so i decided i'm just gonna do it
and then upload it to youtube and also
whereas in the past i have done the
builds and then occasionally actually
built one now i'm going to commit to do
the build and then most of the time
actually build them so i will be
building one of these builds
specifically the $1200 build later this
month so stay tuned for that and finally
before we get into the builds you guys
should definitely check out and vote on
the straw poll for next month
what pc bills do you want to see in
august it's linked on the video
description I got a cheat be are ready
system budget gaming rig $1200
all-rounder or a GTX 980 SLI built any
of those you can vote on and those will
be used to determine what we talk about
next month but let's get into the builds
for this month starting with the less
expensive $600 rx for e build and there
it is right there I based it around a
core i3 6100 CPU it's a dual core
processor with hyper threading it's
skylake it will be upgradeable although
it is one of the weaker parts of this
system but it only costs about 110 $220
u.s. right now I've got an asus
motherboard crucial memory of course
that AMD graphics card
wasn't AMD SSD you know just for
matchy-matchy is fractal design core
2300 case in an EVGA at 500 watt power
supply so let's go over these parts one
at a time and we'll kind of talk about
what's what also by the way check out my
builds list my builds playlist on
youtube if you want to see me do builds
and anytime I do these builds I will add
them to that list alright so starting
off with the processor it's a core i3
6100 3 megabyte cache 3.7 gigahertz so
it actually runs at a pretty decent
frequency and it does have hyper
threading so even though it's got two
physical cores it's got four logical
cores so that can trick some games that
require a quad core into working with
this processor and it comes with a CPU
heatsink fan which is also important for
motherboard I just stuck with an Asus
budget range motherboard again this is a
little over a hundred dollars depending
where you buy it at z170 e LGA 1151 this
should be drop-in compatible with kb
lake once it comes out so if you do
decide to upgrade that weaker link in
the system being the processor you can
drop that into this motherboard or you
should be able to with a BIOS update
based on what we are told other than
that it's got a nice feature set
all-around good feedback from from the
reviews and whatnot and hey even a $20
million rebate card at new AG if you buy
it there right now cool for memory we
went to a 2 by 4 gig kit 8 gigs total
Crucial Ballistix sport it's it's kind
of sporty you know it's silver it's got
some digi camo in there which I'm not a
huge fan of but hey that'll blend in
black and silver though I'll blend in
with the motherboard and look pretty
nice in an 8 gig kick kit is what you
want for an SSD I like to do an only an
SSD and most of my builds simply because
I feel like most people have old hard
drives lying around that they can easily
drop in to add some more mass storage
and a 240 gig SSD will get you by
without too much difficulty about 60
bucks is kind of the going price for a
decent 240 or 256 gig SSD this is a
solid pick from AMD Radeon I actually
don't know who OEM is this SSD I used to
but I forget now and let's move on then
to the actual graphics card Nick's which
is of course the Radeon R X 480 now if
you looked at my actual parts list you
might have spotted the rx 480 which is
listed right here and actually wrote in
the price for this at $200 so I went
with a 4 gig card this is the only 4
gate card that's currently listed on PC
part picker
for gig cards are $200 and this is an
XFX version right here anyway a lot of
these are sold out right now but they're
supposed to be more stock coming in soon
if you happen to get a four gig are X
480 there is a chance if you get one of
these early versions that you might
actually get a for an 8 gig card even
though it's actually running on a V bios
that runs only 4 gigs of that memory so
what you can do is check and even some
of the boxes this is a tweet count
article by the way even some of the
boxes said 8 gig on them and they put a
four gig sticker over it
so if you happen to get one of these
lucky early versions then you can
basically flash your V bios with an 8
gig version and you get an 8 gig card
for the 4 gig price that's not
guaranteed by any stretch I imagine AMD
will be launching actual 4 gig cards as
well but hey it's 40 bucks cheaper and
you get the chance of getting free vram
right now and for this build honestly
you're probably gonna be playing at 1080
anyway and 4 gigs is probably sufficient
so for the 40 bucks and to keep the
price down a little bit the 4 gig card
but hey if you really want the 8 gigs
pay 40 bucks more for a case I went with
a simple fractal core design fractal
design core 2300 it's a full sized ATX
case in this 40 bucks this is just it's
a purely features and a basic simple
design that will get the job done it's
got a USB 3.0 up on the front and you
know nothing blingy at all about this
case but it's solidly built and it has
the features you need to put this the
parts in there and get everything up and
running
finally for power supply I keep going
with the EVGA power supplies trust me
guys I keep looking and trying to find
other good alternatives but EVGA just
seems to have a pretty decent
stranglehold on like the good 80 plus
bronze or better rated power supplies
this is not their supernova series as
long as you don't get a supernova
supernova any X and that was pointed out
to me in the may build series the
supernova NEX not good rated not well
rated but the other ones in that series
from EVGA all the other ones are pretty
good this one does not have very nice
cabling like some of the other models
but it is a more budget to variety for
500 Watts 80 plus bronze power supply
hey you can't go wrong with that one and
you know other options are out there but
well I'll leave that to you guys if you
haven't spend a little bit more to get
better cabling or that kind of thing
that's all for the first build let's
move on to the second build which is
more expensive of course
this is the $1,200 it's based around a
gtx 1070 and i was going to go with a
quad-core like 6400 or 6500 for the
processor and then I was like Nina I
think it's 6600 K will be good for this
so you could get a gtx 1070 based build
for less money than this for sure you
could probably shave one to two hundred
dollars off of this by for example going
with a 42 $50 cheaper processor that's
not unlocked that maybe doesn't require
an aftermarket CPU cooler you could also
get a little bit cheaper price on the
graphics card for example and I'll show
you one example of that if you don't
want to go with the founders Edition and
you know there's a couple other places
you could shave off money but hey this
is a $1,200 build and I think it's
really solid all around it's also very
well matched it's black and red and if
you want to match up the colors on your
system then build a black and red system
because that is definitely like the the
easiest way to do that running down the
parts one more time though I 560 600k
can get these for about 240 bucks now if
you find a micro Center walk in and buy
it for cheaper again forty to fifty
dollars less you can get the not
unlocked versions of these but you can
get a lot of extra power a lot of extra
performance by overclocking at 6600 K so
go for this if you're planning to
overclock it and of course if you do
overclock well if you do get the
unlocked processors they don't come with
the heat sink fan so you will need to
buy one
the cry Rig h7 is a great choice for
that it's about $35 you can buy it here
from Amazon oh it does have free
shipping okay 35 bucks plus free
shipping that's also available on Newegg
but a very solid cooler it looks pretty
nice too and I'm going to be building
the system and I have one of those so
hey that's useful MSI's gaming z170a
gaming m3 motherboard is the one that I
chose here again black and red z170
chipsets good good features all around
you know it's got your SATA Express on
there and your your new egg you know
image and knowing needs to like knowing
image servers used to be awesome they
would pop up in like seconds now it
takes way too long like watch watch how
long this takes okay that wasn't
terribly long but anyway good power
delivery on this it's a decent
overclocker LGA 1151 socket of course
forward four dims
for memory say to express it even does
have an MDOT to porch kind of right in
there in the middle
just underneath CPU slot so very very
nice seldom other board all around for
memory I went with black and red of
course g.skill ripjaws five series lots
of black and red memory kits out there
this one was just a good deal seventy
bucks and it's fast ddr4 3000 so hey if
you can find equivalent memory or faster
memory for roughly the same price I
always go for the faster memory when
that's an option although I don't pay
exorbitant amounts of cash for it you
don't need the faster memory but hey as
well next up for SSD I wanted the 480
gig drive I find the 480 gig drives are
just eminently affordable now a little
over $100 for this 109 total it's a
SanDisk SSD plus it's not quite as good
as their ultra the very solid read and
write speeds overall and again black and
red hay matches with the color scheme
look how thoughtful I was with that
alright moving on to the graphics card
and this is the one that I actually have
right here and I have reviewed or at
least I did an SLI test with this this
is msi gtx 1070 gaming X I believe and
they also have a just a gaming version
of it now here's an interesting thing
about these cards at least their
listings on Newegg first off it's pretty
expensive I mean 380 is what the
founders of dish or what they reference
cards are supposed to be or than
whatever they're calling the non
reference cards this one's for 60 it is
overclocked right out of the box but you
could get four four hundred and forty
dollars the gaming version that's not
gaming X which looks exactly the same
doesn't have the RGB lighting on it but
the RGB lighting wasn't all that
impressive for me anyway and you can
just get this one on overclocking and
your performance to be the same and you
can save twenty bucks so maybe go ahead
and do that and that would be a little
bit better option for you than paying
the full price for the gaming X version
although that is what I've listed here
so you can shave 20 bucks off the price
just by doing that but that's your
graphics card let's just finish out with
the case NZXT s340 this is the black and
red version so again a little bit of red
accents on there will help everything
match super nice it's got a big side
panel window so your red and black build
will look pretty in there with your
special cabling and all that good stuff
and yeah for 75 bucks very solid case
all around
very
reviewed finally for power supply EVGA
again the 650 GQ this time
this one's 80 plus gold rated so it's
definitely more efficient so you'll save
a little bit more on your power bill
nine point four out of ten from Johnny
guru who does really good power spy
reviews and again 75 bucks for 650 watt
80 plus gold so I think that's a great
choice and the cabling on this also it's
not fully modular it's partially modular
but even that even that cable that's
that's permanently attached has a nice
black cabling on it so it's going to
look good in your build anyway that's
all for this video guys I hope you have
enjoyed it again I will be building
that's gtx 1070 system very soon so stay
