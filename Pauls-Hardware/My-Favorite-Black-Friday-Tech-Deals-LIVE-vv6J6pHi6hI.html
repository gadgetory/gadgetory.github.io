I should be streaming I should be live
at least it should be going live just
any any moment now any second alright it
looks like I'm live so cool all right
hello everyone and welcome this is my
Black Friday video I'm doing this live
and basically what I've been doing last
night until I fell asleep in my chair as
well as this morning when I got up is
just browsing and perusing all the
different Black Friday deals that are
available right now yeah now these are
mostly going to be us bass first of all
so sorry for you guys for international
but a lot of these products are
available internationally you just have
to go to your local retailer whatever
that might be and also full disclosure
here this video is not sponsored in any
way shape or form by any manufacturer or
retailer anything like that I'd just
found these deals and they were all ones
that I thought I might be interested in
myself so I listed them all down however
my Amazon links in the description are
using my affiliate code so if you do buy
them through that I will get a little
bit of a kickback so that's great way to
support me but I just wanted to let you
guys know how things are working for
today I am mainly focusing on technology
computer parts and then I have a few
extra categories toward the end for
peripherals as well as some other
accessories and all of these links are
down in the video's description if you
guys want to check them out so let's get
started I should switch over to the
right page first with PC components I'm
going to start with CPUs right out of
the gate with an Intel Core i7 68 50 K
which is available on Amazon I believe
Newegg also had this deal for $500 which
is well over $100 less than it usually
constitutionally up above 600 bucks
it is the six core with 40 PCIe lanes
Broadwell II it's a great processor I've
used it Evan in the system behind me
actually and it's a pretty significant
discount and amazon also has a 6700 K
for $300 and they have 6600 K for 220
dollars but if you really want the best
deal on a CPU can get
now and you're in the US and you're
close to one Micro Center far and away
has the best deals for these 6600 K for
a hundred and eighty bucks or if you
want to get a little bit more power 6700
K for two hundred and sixty dollars this
is $30 more than a 6600 K costs at most
places full time or like when when
there's not a deal going on so lucky you
if you're near a Micro Center and you
can walk into one of those and get one
of those processors all right let's move
on from CPUs to GPUs I was looking at
some AMD processors but I don't know I
just I do have one with a combo later on
in the motherboard section so anyway
let's continue GPU is quite a few good
deals right now and the thing I was most
excited about this time around is that
you can actually finally get in videos
10 series GPUs or at least the high-end
1080 and 1070 for the MSRP that they
originally talked about when they first
advertised these so this is the gigabyte
GTX gaming g1 it's got a pretty nice
little three fan cooler on it and it is
five hundred and ninety five dollars a
full five dollars less than the MSRP
that Nvidia teased us with like how long
ago was that six months or something
like that
anyway it's good we can finally get
these for a more reasonable price if
you're looking for a 1080 even cheaper
than that
Asus has their turbo version which is a
blower style fan but still a perfectly
adequate GTX 1080 and a very a good
candidate for like water cooling or
something like that down the line 580
bucks though so that's $20 off the MSRP
cool and finally I got an Asus GTX 1080
this is the Strix version which is very
highly rated for both its cooler as well
as the RGB features if that's something
you're into this is 610 dollars right
now but if you go to the rebate forums a
little little drop down here it's got
the $20 million rebate which brings it
down to five and ninety also a quite
good deal let's move over to the gtx
1070 which you can also find for a much
more reasonable price at least during
the Black Friday sales as well as these
should go on through Cyber Monday a lot
of them and even in the next couple
weeks 370 dollars which again is like 10
bucks less than the MSRP that was
originally advertised this is also the
Asus blower style version of it but if
you want something a little
but different oh wait that's a 1060
there are a couple other 1070 s that are
out there that I found that were three
hundred and eighty to three hundred and
ninety dollars that are the more
custom-designed versions with the custom
coolers so check those out on amazon 370
to 390 is kind of what you can expect to
pay for a 10 1070 in the u.s. during
these sale times so that's cool too if
you're looking for some a little bit
more reasonably priced the GTX 1060 is
also being cut down it usually is about
$250 MSRP it's 225 dollars at least for
this is otech mini version of the 68
version 250 bucks is for the 68 version
I should I should also mention the 250
to 300 I guess usually and then if
you're going for something on the AMD
side or you want something kind of right
in the in-between between like your 1050
1060 and like your 1070 1080 MD has a
pretty compelling offering in the r9
fury and this is what version by
Sapphire which also has a a triples fan
style cooler $260 and yeah that's a
pretty good deal for that one for gigs
of HBM memory so don't let the four gigs
fool you the HBM memory performs very
well finally a great deal here for our
x4 60 this one is a little bit more
limited because it's an Amazon Prime
deal so you need to sign up for Amazon
Prime if you're not already if you're
already signed up for Amazon Prime cuz a
lot of people already are
then then do that and then this will
basically be a hundred and ten dollars
and then you can use the rebate form
here once again to not get down thirty
bucks more which brings it down to 80 80
bucks for an Rx for 60 a very capable
card for that price which I was pretty
impressed with and and look there's a
mail-in rebate form just in case you
didn't believe me
alright let's move on to other words I
just have a couple in here I was trying
to find something for the different
platforms at least that are available on
the intel side right now since i'm still
waiting on AMG's and for stuff to start
recommending their new motherboards or
at least picking up a brand new one okay
I thought I do have a combo again
further down here but this is an msi
z170a LGA 1151 so this will fit your
skylake processors z170 chipset so it's
unlocked it's got a nice color scheme
it's all black here even
you know a little bit of cooling on the
Vieira's and stuff this isn't gonna be
like a crazy good overclocker but you
should be able to still overclock
without a pretty reasonable range 110
dollars for this as well as free
shipping which is always nice so that's
a good deal that is actually can even be
brought down with the $10 Mellon rebate
to $100 so I think that's a great deal
for a pretty nice well-designed MSI z170
board there if you're into x99 I
couldn't find too many deals in this
range this is another MSI board the x99
a raider
which is also very nice-looking color
scheme as far as it's all black it's
kind of got the OP the more brownish
style PCB on the motherboard but hey
getting yourself unto the x99 platform
from a motherboard that costs a hundred
and sixty bucks that's a pretty good
deal and of course if you're willing to
spend 200 bucks or more you can get some
additional features on an X 99 board but
if you're just looking to get on to that
platform I think this is a great starter
board and then also this is a Fry's deal
that they have going on right now which
is a AMD combo so I have the picture
small but and includes the Wraith cooler
which is actually a pretty nice cooler
for considering that's kind of like a
stock cooler that's been upgraded and FX
83-70 and an msi 990 FX a gaming
motherboard all for 189 or just about
$190 that is after a rebates I'm not
sure if it's a mail-in rebate or if it's
an instant rebate or something like that
but for the motherboard processor and
cooler a hundred and ninety bucks I
think that's a pretty good deal for that
too
alright let's move on to some memory I
just have a couple memory choices here
but these are kind of more like ballpark
range figures so if you figure you can
buy this memory for about this price and
you should be able to find other memory
because these are going to be coming and
going throughout the weekends as far as
what's available stuffs going to sell
out and stuff but if you're looking for
something ddr4 if you're on x99 platform
or z170 platform or if you're on the
basically the newest Intel platforms for
skylake or abroad well e then you should
get ddr4 memory and you can get a 2 by 8
gig kick kits for $65 right now this is
a team dark kit that's over on Newegg
but there's lots of comparable memory
out there that's ddr4
8gig dims I think is a good way to go
for gig dims are kind of kind of losing
their luster for me they're a little
small for me in my personal opinion now
but look keep a lookout for $65 16 gig
memory kits and I think you will be
happy
next we have a ddr3 memory sail and ddr3
memory is actually starting to kind of
hit that curve where it comes back up in
price after the availability is starting
to taper off a little bit as people as
the manufacturers switch over to
manufacturing ddr4 more exclusively but
this is a good deal on a very solid
stick of fury HyperX memory for $38
actually a little bit more as far as a
price break gigabyte then the ddr4 stuff
was but it's solid memory it's got a
nice black low profile design and you
know buy two of them if you want 16 gigs
buy four of them if you have an older
ddr3 quad-channel
platform and you need that yeah let's
move over to SSDs and storage
I guess all of my storage today's SSDs I
didn't I didn't really dive into the
hard drive deals starting off with a
high performance one this is an 850 Pro
from Samsung a one terabyte model 2.5
inch drive 372 dollars and 11 cents now
that is a little bit on the expensive
side for a one terabyte SSD but bear in
mind you're paying for the performance
here this is the 850 pro model which has
some features as far as the endurance
and that kind of thing that you might be
looking for if you're looking for a
higher-end SSD if you wants just the one
terabyte nice fast SSD that's maybe not
quite as fast as the 850 pro late 50 Evo
can be had for less than a more than
$100 less 250 bucks for an 850 Evo 1
terabyte also quite a good deal the
cheapest I've found a good one terabyte
drive for was about 170 hundred and
eighty dollars and I'm sure some of
those deals might be popping up but when
they do I think they will be gone soon
crucial had the MX 300 like they've
weird capacities like 525 gigs and 750
gigs and they had a few of those sales
going on on Amazon Newegg and they're
just gone they're actually on sale on
ebay z-- on new eggs eBay store for some
reason and not on new I got it I don't
know why they
did it that way but they did anyway so
850 Evo - 1 terabyte for 250 is a good
deal for a pretty again very solid
performance drive and then if you want
something that's the cheapest I could
find as far as a you know good 1
terabyte SSD 210 dollars for the SanDisk
SSD + right now 960 I actually have one
of these I thought I had it on here so
close to me somewhere but it's not but
yeah it 210 dollars still I want
everybody SSD is a beautiful thing it's
a nice thing to have but if you don't
want to spend 200 bucks plus on an SSD
check out this this is only going to be
available for a short period of time
because it's the deal of the day right
now but it is still on right now
transcend 480 gig
it's a TLC drive but again you're just
you're mainly getting like SSD response
time and that kind of thing with this
you're not looking for really really
high read and write performance although
I mean reads and writes are still five
hundred fifty megabytes per second 415
mega megabytes per second I'm not sure
what the I apps are on this thing but
anyway it will get you out of the gate
with a 480 gig drive for 87 dollars and
I think I think you'll be happy with
that great for a system drive great to
add on as like a storage drive for extra
stuff and then finally if you want
something that is a bit more next-gen I
found this Intel's
600 P series which is intended to be a
more budget variety of m dot 2 and nvme
drives but $289 for this and again
that's a one terabyte drive I actually
would probably go for this if you have
the m dot 2 slots over that's over over
the last this one over the 850 Pro it's
just it's cheaper and it's gonna be
faster maybe actually I can't say that
for sure this is a reseller single
single pack but deals on for a couple
more days and you will get nvme supports
and a really fast m dot to drive which
doesn't take up much space either
alright now we are moving into the case
category found a few cases in here this
one's the cooler master master box 5 mid
tower computer case by the way if
there's a rumbling sound that's a train
going by I can't do anything about that
but this is the I'm sorry the master box
5
this is really solid case it has the
same sort of interior frame that the
master case did very similar layouts
it's gotten very good reviews tons of
support for drives and everything in
size and inside and pretty typical ATX
layout but $55 for $55 and 54 cents if
you want to be more specific a great
price for that and free shipping free
shipping on a cases you really need that
and then NZXT I had a different layout
for this before that looked better NZXT
has a pretty decent sale going on
through a new egg for their s340 cases
which are very popular I've built in
these before all around seventy bucks
which is anywhere from fifteen to twenty
dollars off depending on what version
you're getting whether you want the
black and red or the all black or glossy
whites they have the other versions of
it done here as well but they're not
discounted quite quite as much but
seventy bucks for an S 340 I think it's
a pretty good deal too and finally we
have the Roseville neutron this is also
a new egg deal Rosewill it's like no
eggs house brand but this is a mini
Tower Mini ITX
it's slightly on the larger sizes for a
mini ITX case but basically it's ten
bucks
thirty five dollars just what you pay
out of the gates and then out of check
out I guess I should say and then there
is a twenty five dollar rebate card that
you can get so that makes it ten dollars
a pretty good deal for a all-black
commitee ITX case you of course will
need a power supply for your new
computer that you're obviously building
with all these new components so here is
a pretty nice one I would recommend this
for someone who's maybe considering an
SLI configuration either now or in the
future of course there's our MX series
80 plus gold certified all modular
completely modular and I believe the
cabling also looks pretty nice on this
one there's the cables yes cables are
all black and 850 watt will handle most
two-way SLI or crossfire configurations
if you're going for something like that
and 105 bucks which is a good forty to
fifty dollars off the typical MSRP if
you want something a little bit less
expensive the Rozsival capstone g650 is
available through Newegg this is a
pretty solid 80 plus gold again rated
power supply it is modular
it's it's got a pretty good design on
here the cabling I don't believe there's
quite as nice it does have a little bit
of ketchup and mustard going on but
again thirty dollar rebate card takes
the price of seventy-five dollars all
the way down to I believe forty or forty
five so that is a good deal for a forty
five dollars after the mail-in rebate so
yeah very solid deal for a adequate 650
watt 80 plus gold rated power supply
that will last you probably for quite a
few years
alright that's all I got for power
supplies well I just drop to my my wrist
wrist didn't need to do that my wrist
wrist anyone people always ask me about
this it's made by hand stands and I'll
see if I can add a link to it in the
description too just in case anyone's
wondering about that
all right peripherals were getting
through this all right Logitech has a
couple really nice deals going on on
Amazon right now the g502 proteus
spectrum Proteus spectrum RGB available
for 40 bucks that's about half off
pretty much it's very well reviewed
mouse this isn't one that I've used
myself but I have taken word-of-mouth
from quite a few people who have who I
know who have tried it out and
recommended it's got a weight system
built into it which is pretty nice I
like mice with weight systems and
Logitech does a good job so check that
one out we also have the Logitech G 610
Orien at red backlit mechanical gaming
keyboard so this has actually MX red
switches and the price has changed since
I added this like 20 minutes ago
I think wait where did my proof rules
list go yeah the price went up by well
shoot well never mind about this one but
this was sixty bucks now it is back up
to 90 bucks and it was I think a deal of
the day or something like that that that
they changed so I was afraid this was
gonna happen between when I got all of
my deals together and I actually pulled
them up here but you know what whatever
it's fine
let's talk about this one this one is
still on sale this is a Corsair straight
from mechanical gaming keyboard also
Cherry MX brown switches this time which
are my personal favorites in the Cherry
MX category $70 for a nicely made
corsair mechanical keyboard
with actual Cherry MX switches I think
that's a pretty good deal I've said that
a lot I feel like today moving on to
some headphones the Sennheiser HD 598
sees $100 these are usually 250 MSRP
although you can typically get them
around two hundred or even a little less
but 999 ninety-five for these it's a
very solid deal they are close back so
they're gonna give you a little bit more
of that in your brain type of feel when
you're listening to stuff rather than
having the more open sound stage but if
you are you know be listening to these
anywhere where there's lots of ambient
noise or that kind of thing having a
closed back is a great way to go because
it will block out a lot of the exterior
sound all right finally we have a couple
sort of monitors and then some TVs that
I threw in here at the end the monitor
I'm starting off with is a 4k 28 inch
from Asus the mg 2 8uq to be specific
which is on sale for 350 bucks right now
not a huge discount I mean it's usually
450 but this is a really solid 28 inch
4k TV I'm sorry 4k monitor and I really
like to stand on this one hate tilt
swivel pivot all that good stuff and
pretty much good specs all around and a
suits they make some solid man monitors
it's also matte I'm pretty sure matte
finish because glossy sucks all right
here's a samsung 40 inch 4k Ultra HD so
this is a smart LED TV but Bob from KB
Mod actually I saw him tweet this one
earlier he as well as a couple other
people he knows use this as their
monitor for their computer there are
some downsides to using a TV as a
monitor but this one does have HDMI 2.0
input it's 40 inches and it's 350
dollars and it's 4k and it's got LED
edge lighting it's not LED full
backlighting or anything like that but
for the size and and the for Kanis and
all that good stuff very good deal
350 bucks for that one usually it's
around 400 on sale here's the TV that I
bought just recently and actually bought
this through a slick deals you know it
had the little slick deals fire fire
icon on it because target had a 10% off
promo code that went along with this
even without the promo
at $800 this lg tv 65-inch 65 uh6 1:5 a
it is LED backlit it's an IPS panel that
has HDR support it's not the most
maximum a treat HDR support but I've
been testing it out and it looks very
nice it doesn't have the like super inky
blacks like you would get with a no LED
but it's eight hundred dollars it's not
two thousand dollars which is probably
more like what you would pay for TV this
size pretty nice thin bezel as well
three HDMI 2.0 inputs I believe they're
2.0 a and one of them does have HDCP
support and a very nice TV just again
very minor prague and i need to have
local access to a Target store because
this is an in-store pickup only as far
as I know they might have oh no so ships
free alright maybe you can have a
chipped we wouldn't picked it up at the
store we thought that was easier and
then finally this isn't really a monitor
but kind of fits in with it a dual
monitor arm arm from flex mounts so as
long as your monitor has vasive support
I believe this is 75 millimeter and 100
millimeter you can grab this it clamps
down to the back of your desk as long as
your desk is pretty sturdy and holds two
monitors side by side good reused forty
five bucks on Amazon so there you go
that's all that's that's all for this
video I appreciate any of you guys who
sat there and listened to me talk about
all these products because you could
easily have just gone on and get down
into the video description and seeing
all of them rather than listening to me
talk but hey I like talking to you guys
if you like listening I hope you're all
enjoying your Black Friday and holiday
weekend and buying stuff if that's what
you're doing or just relaxing at home if
that's what you're doing that's what I'm
trying to do but yeah cheers to you guys
and remember a lot of these deals will
continue through the weekend not
everything though but if you do happen
to click the links in the description it
helps me out a lot thank you very much
for watching and I'll see you guys very
soon
I also forgot that I have to click the
button over here to end the video that's
