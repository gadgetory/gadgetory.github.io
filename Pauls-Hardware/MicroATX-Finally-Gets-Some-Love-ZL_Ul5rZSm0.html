to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and thermaltake my next up on my
Computex tour is Thermaltake and they
have a ton of stuff on display they
always have some epic systems and I'm
actually gonna do a builds of Computex
video later in my coverage so come back
for that because I will be showing some
close-ups of those but let's talk
specifically about products that
Thermaltake is showcasing and actually
have a few new cases first off the
thermal take a 500 now I thought this
case had a pretty sexy and striking
design it's got an aluminum top and
front as well as vented strips that you
can see along the top and front edges
and they're kind of tucked into that two
tempered glass that you get for both
side panels does a steel frame
internally and then the tempered glass
side panels can swing open for access to
the interior of the case there's a
vertical GPU mount as well so you can
set your GPU there to put it on display
for everyone to see and it's got a
modular storage rack so it has little
Drive cages that you can position up or
down on that rack a two cages are
included so nice to have a little bit of
modularity there I have seen designs
like this in the past but thermaltake
has decided to add it to theirs as well
there's a dust filter on the bottom of
the case that should be a requirement
and for i/o you've got two USB three and
two USB two on the i/o this is a more
silent optimized case which is why
they've kind of tucked the ventilation
along to the sides there but for
radiator support the front and the top
both supports 360 rads or 280 read so 3
by 120 or 2 by 140 we're expecting this
to launch at the end of q3 and they've
told me the estimated MSRP is 229
dollars next up we have several cases
that are all labeled level 20 now the
level 20 is the successor to the level
10 case that they came out with like 10
years ago I was actually one of the
earliest like super high-end premium
cases from Thermaltake that I ever
worked with
with individually compartmentalized
spaces for all the different components
level 20 they showed off last year at
Computex it was an extremely high-end
case and it sort of took a lot of the
designs from the original sort of
brought it up to modern standards so now
they have three new versions of the
level 20s these are all expected to
launch late in q3 and the pricing I'm
going to tell you guys is tentative for
now but I do have at least ballpark
pricing let's go from small to big
starting with the level 20 VT which is a
micro ATX enclosure it's going to cost
$99 estimated and it's going to come
a 200 millimeter front intake fan now
what they have setup for the display
here is showing lots of RGB and stuff
the fan it will shifflet's will not have
RGB but it does have four tempered glass
panels on both sides front and top at
the entire rear panel as well as
motherboard tray can all be rotated
together so that gives you three
potential configurations you can have it
horizontal or you can twist it so the
motherboards on one side or flip it
around so the motherboard is on the
other side that's a nice bit of
flexibility there I also like that this
is a micro ATX case because you don't
tend to see a lot of love for micro ATX
but good to have options here it is on
the larger side for mark micro ATX but
it's made to fit a full water cooling
setup next up is the level 20 XT a bit
of a step up from the level 20 VT sort
of a taller still box like design this
one's gonna cost 199 dollars estimated
and it will come with one 140 millimeter
standard fan they didn't include a lot
of fans with these models because
they're assuming that you're gonna want
to choose your own fans to install there
whether you want thermal take RGB ones
or otherwise this case also has a
tempered glass top front and sides and
it's got a dual PSU mount at the bottom
so it supports a ATX motherboards and
there's just tons of space inside that
you can see here so I imagined for
modders or anyone who might want to
figure out how to fit two systems in
there there's probably is a way to do
that the motherboard tray sits on a
couple rails and that can actually be
shifted forward or back or just expanded
upon again for that EA TX support and
you can fit some pretty huge radiators
in here dual 480 millimeter rads can be
fit at the bottom of the case or up at
the top of the case and of course that's
very ideal for water cooling the i/o is
pretty nice here as well you get two USB
2.0 2 USB 3.0 as well as a Type C let's
move on to the level 20 GT RGB this
one's gonna cost mid $200 range they
weren't quite as specific with their
estimated cost for this one but this one
is pretty cool because you can take the
entire PCI Express tray where all the
expansion slots and you can rotate that
so that'll allow you to do standard
mounting for graphics cards or by
rotating that whole thing you can do
vertical GPU mounts for SLI which is a
bit more rare than just those single two
or three slot vertical GPU mounts this
one has locking tempered glass swing
doors on both sides for easy access into
the case and they wanted to point out
that the tempered glass panels are
actually spaced out away from the case
so even though air can't blow through
tempered glass around the edges there's
a decent size gap so you can still get
some airflow the i/o on this one is
actually split between the two top
sides of the case but it does include 2
USB 2 2 8 USB 3 as well as that type C
3.1 port this case does support up to 4
200 millimeter fans and since it's a
little bit more on the expensive side
they did ship it with fans included so
you get 2 200 millimeter ring plus RGB
fans for the front or you can reposition
them and then 1 140 millimeter ring plus
RGB as well also if I didn't mention
these systems have like badass
water-cooled systems installed in there
so a good example of how you might kid
out one of these cases if you happen to
buy one now thermaltake has received a
lot of praise for their RGB LED eco
system and indeed it is pretty expansive
with lots of different effects and they
have control boxes that you can use to
expand it out so for example not just
having all the LEDs in your case but
they like to make an entire wall full of
their RGB LED fans to demonstrate just
how many can be connected and controlled
all at the same time it's called
Thermaltake RGB plus and they've added
thermal take AI voice control to it now
which basically means you can use an app
just tell it what effect you want it to
do and it will load up that effect for
you I don't know if that is artificial
intelligence strictly speaking but voice
control is nice for RGB LEDs they also
have a couple new RGB LED fan designs so
to go along with their original thermal
take ring RGB LED fans which have again
received lots of praise they now have
the ring duo and the ring trio the duo
has a pretty similar frame design to the
original ring fans but they've added a
second set of addressable RGB LEDs to
the hub of the fan and they're also
updating the fan blades and the housing
around the side was sort of a frosty
semi opaque finish and that will allow
the lights to shine through while being
diffused enough so you get a nice bit of
soft diffusion the ring trio I think RGB
fanatics will be very interested in
because it has three sets of RGB LEDs as
trio might imply it also has a new
single piece frame that goes around the
edge so that allows both RGB rings
around the ringed outside to shine
through and it's a separate set of LEDs
on either side of the fan as well as
that third set of LEDs in the fan hub
altogether though this makes for a
pretty impressive set of RGB components
that can all be integrated together and
they had sort of the ideal RGB LED
fanatics desk setup going on there
Thermal Mike was doing some
demonstrations there they had the desk
the computer all of the peripheral
connected as well as all the fans up on
the wall I particularly like some of the
2-tone RGB themes that they have set up
with this like they had a white and
yellow theme that I thought that was
pretty cool but the software of course
is also being developed over time I'm
not gonna dive into that right now but
you can easily go in there to select the
different components setup themes change
the colors and make it all go and be
pretty but guys that's all the time I
have for this video of the thermaltake
booth at Computex 2018 I'd like to say a
huge thank you to my sponsors
thermaltake of course as well as
gigabytes team group and Coolermaster I
have more Computex videos coming down
the pipeline so don't forget to
subscribe hit the thumbs up button and
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
