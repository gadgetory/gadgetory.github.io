to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster so guys if you probably
know Coolermaster is also one of my
sponsors so I am stopping by their booth
here at the Nanjing Exhibition Centre
they have a new cosmos case and a new
half cake and we're going to check it
out let's go
hey guys and I just teased you with the
cages but I'm stopping by peripherals
first controller master does for that -
here it is the flagship MK 750 we're
working on this right now it's going to
feature first all the Cherry MX switches
that you might want to have because
fuller Master works with cherry and they
usually have all the available Cherry MX
switches but look at that nice light bar
kind of going across the front there
it's pretty clean also they've added a
wrist rest something that was frequently
requested with the pro series when the
master keys line up for it - got
individual RGB backlit keys coolermaster
is continuing their tradition of high
build quality making sure this is like
steel reinforced inside everything right
okay yeah you'll be impressed inside
basically use this in a knife fight or
something to protect yourself to get it
back it will save your life
Solar master guarantees it I'm just
kidding I just made that up but it will
at least give you a really nice tactile
feel when you're typing a first due to
the mechanical switches and I also kind
of like what they've done with the low
profile look on the like the Windows key
I'm trying to point at this terribly out
of focus the windows key here and over
here they just kind of have their
outline of their logo also down here in
the center rather than having to look
the words on it so I think that's what
kind of a cool look this should be
available about q3 look at an August
September timeframe and it's going to
retail for just about 150 $9.99 so a
very nice option very nice addition to
cool masters master key series at the
top in the master keys Pro 750 now here
we have the whole lineup of master keys
we've got the pro l Croat RGB and all
that good stuff and honestly you guys
are molarity familial Z because I have
been doing pre rolls on them
I've seen them on my channel so they
want small medium or large you can get
it but what's cool the rest is doing is
they're trying to make sure that these
LEDs don't suck they know that not
everyone is into it you want to make
things a little bit more useful so
whether you want an FPS configuration or
overwatch or MOBA or anything like that
you can get the configurations to load
up onto the keyboard first you can set
those at least us everything is
internally saved to the keyboard can
access it with the function keys and
cutting other stuff can also save
profile and a great way to also give
yourself some helpful indication via
those RGB LEDs rather than just having
them light up and look pretty
now if you guys are familiar with the
coolermaster Devastator combo that's a
mouse and a keyboard that you can get
for really really inexpensive like 40
bucks sometimes even 30 bucks on sales a
really nice setup for an issue level
gamers not going to step up with
something that is a little bit closer to
a full mechanical keyboard extreme you
can try the MS 120 which is the master
set 120 which is this keyboard and it
also comes with this mouse over here
these are men cannibal switches so they
are sort of a combination of men
membrane and mechanical so you're not
going to get quite the durability but
you are going to get the same clicky
tactile feel they've updated this with
cooking it I'm not sure if you guys can
hear it very well because it's really
loud in here right now but you never
really nice feel that about a 55 grams
actuation force and I really like to
feel them very very very similar to a
full mechanical feel and the fact is you
can get that keyboard and the mouse for
$89.99 so wow I think that's a pretty
good deal knots itself is right here get
your wrist at this a little bit more for
a quad rip but they also have a first
Paulding grip options over here if you
don't want to buy the combo you can get
the mouse by itself so additional
options for the mice mm 5 30 mm 5 20 the
higher the number the better the quality
of the mouse for example but you do get
to 12,000 DPI picsArt sensor this is
what the vago sensors are now called
they are optical sensors they have
rugged PVC button and depending of
course on your drift
and you feel and how you like to use
your mouse
the Masters got you covered so here's
your chart for reference
um flaw or module and just to round out
all the peripherals here the master
mouth Rowell and throw at Sean left here
$59.99 you've been out for a while so
they might already be familiar with them
but again depending on your grip and
everything there's different variations
of it and they still also have that
12,000 dpi Spencer you get the message
master wealth on the right as well and
everything less expensive option
alright we got one more peripheral this
is the nh3 20 it is a headset so kind of
the sequel for the master pulse but you
also get a new mic gonna cost you about
40 bucks it has a steel band going
around the top he's got a boom mic so it
can position the mic in front of your
face so I can pick up what you found
like guess the nice it's gotta be like
faux leather something like that in it
you're just making squishing siffredi
when it's looking to get into the
headset game for a reasonable price
check out the mh3 one oh lordy alright
you guys are familiar with the half
series right high airflow very iconic
series of cases of cooler master made
sit back in the middle a 2000 they're
bringing it back they're basically
creating a lines the leaders fully
branded master case but when it has an H
like the H 500 right here the H is going
to meet it half 500 means it's a big
challenge and oh my gosh look at this
okay I think this is pretty nice alright
to go to every class item you have of
course all steel interior construction
you have a basement down in the bottom
for your parks life you have the option
to mount your graphics cards out here if
you want and
moving over for the front although the
system did just turn off you have 200
millimeter fans 200 millimeter RGB fans
which is pretty impressive these are the
first 200 millimeter RGB fans we're told
from full domestic and then on top you
also have 3 120 so I imagine anything
you could set up some crazy radiator
configurations with this case up in the
front you a USB 3.0 USB 2.0 this is a
sample product that they've got going on
so I'm trying to turn this is the Beca
so yeah it's a work in progress of
course these are all samples that they
have going on so they're not necessarily
finished good but yet this is looking
really sweet I also kind of like what
they've done with the cable management
area here here in the back got some
brackets they can pop on a little
moveable SSD trays and overall just
really nice the consistent I don't know
what doesn't get it cost or when it's
going to launch but and sold it might be
like 150 bucks or left even maybe as low
as I got him 3 or 140 so I'll keep your
eyes up for this one again good the
master case each 500 P part of the have
to high camp and here's the big boy the
cosmos see 700 G if you disrespect for
the cosmos which they just did a 25th
anniversary edition of that was just
kind of a send-off this is the new
version so it still has the iconic
handles up at the top and down at the
bottom they've added of course RGB LED
lighting active around the i/o at the
price resolves across the top as well
and from under glow lighting it's a lava
this can all be controlled via the
button at the top of the cake which
means that you can cycle through all of
the seven or eight preset colors that
are in there or you can cycle through
some other bird control mode and you can
use the direct plug into the motherboard
options so you can sync everything with
the motherboard if I know there is an
RGB
support here inside as well for the GPU
which pathetical prevents the GPU stack
now in certainly this thing is
absolutely completely modular you can
take it apart and move everything around
and put it back together all of the
screws that are used internally to hold
the whole thing together are the same so
you can't really like move this specific
screw that's made to put things together
in a certain way you just got a
placement available the motherboards can
be set up as is a mother bird can be
rotated 90 degrees or can be rotate 180
degrees that's pretty cool as well you
might notice the side panel is a curved
tempered last piece it's the first time
I've seen anything like that and just
notice that on the back
pecially case and a surprise for you at
the attorneys on the front panel you've
got USB 3.1 support right up there so
compatible just new headers that we've
seen as type-c connector as well all
four you have two 3.0 ports up there as
well and then finally they've also got a
couple steel cables that are in there
that can also be removed with building
screw those well if you cover up and
protect your expansion area for drive
there's a bunch of drive gauges that you
can put on the right side here there's
also the shroud that covers the PSU at
the bottom again also removable I like a
really cool look that kind of inverted
and curved in which is something that I
just haven't really seen before there's
another panel that's very similarly
designed here in the back just helping
with a couple screws so you can pop that
off to protect your cable management
area they did apologize to the kill
management in here this was a very hasty
job that they put together and there is
a fan out down there it looks like it
can support oh gosh it looks like at
least paint and
yeah something like that plus some RGB
controls to customize control board down
there and it's not going to be read in
the finished model they are going to
update that with the different colors
through like I'm guessing black so again
guys that's the cosmos 7 I'm sorry
cosmos see 700 feet the successor to the
very very popular original cosmos I'm
gonna close the side panel here I want
to get a leave shut up you know take
only memories leave only footprints
so there's let me know what you guys
think of this case in the comments I
think it's pretty bad at no idea what
it's gonna crop hey guys that's going to
wrap it up for this video of course I
need to finish by thanking the clauses
