you by Corsair enter max deep cool and
cooler master I am at gigabyte now as
you can maybe tell by the massive forest
sign behind me we have some water
cooling stuff some new memory and an SSD
but most importantly a really cool new
monitor from gigabytes sort of their
first foray into this gaming monitor
field I'm gonna save that for last first
let's take a look at the graphics cards
so this is the Auris GeForce GTX 20 atti
Extreme Edition I actually did a video
on the air-cooled version of this card
which is a very nice air-cooled card but
this is water cooled so it ships
pre-installed with this water block on
top it's real nice clean looking one
it's got the Horace logo that's gonna
light up with RGB I've got a cool
backplate that also has the RGB same RGB
effect on this backplate that it has on
the air-cooled version you know sander
Gina corner fittings massive card pre
water-cooled I don't know what else to
say about it it's gonna have the same
PCB layout power delivery that the
air-cooled extreme version has so
gigabyte has said they'd like me to do a
build with this kind of excited if you
want a nice motherboard to pair that
with here's the z3 90 or extreme water
force so z3 90 motherboard suitable for
your ninety nine hundred KS and down
although honestly if you're getting this
motherboard and you're putting anything
other than a ninety nine hundred K in it
I don't know what is wrong with you it
has again a pre-configured water block
that also cycles down to cool the
chipset here this has leak detection
features on it so if you get leaks
around there it will warn you and again
just standard Gianna Carter fittings RGB
lighting threats so this obviously would
be a great board to pair with that 20 80
TI water for sedition I don't know what
else what else should go in there though
again I mean on the comments gigabyte
has Oris memory now we talked about this
at Computex they sell them with to get
to dims and to dummy dims there's also
full configurations as well just wanted
to let you guys know they're working
with SK Hynix now as well as Samsung so
they're coming out 3666 speed kits as
well as 4,000 sweet kids and here's an
adding card which is an nvme SSD
compatible 10 vm e 1.3 PCI Express 3.0
by 4 connection
and of course very fast SSD speeds
they're comparing this to maybe like a
WD black when it comes to actual speeds
we've got 512 gigs and a one terabyte
version on the one terabyte version you
have sequential reads up to about three
point four gigabytes per second it's a
bunch of writes at about three gigabytes
per second random read I ops it's
610,000 and write I ops at five hundred
and thirty thousand and then of course
you get a very handsome enclosure for
this with the Auris logo some brush
metal and of course a attractive RGB
strip going down the side I started CES
with them some coverage of the our TX
2060 which is now available starting
with an MSRP of 350 dollars and I just
wanted to quickly show you gigabytes
various versions of this there's the
wind force OC 6g here's a pretty
standard version this is the one that
will probably cost 350 bucks to fan
configuration and a pretty simple cooler
on there but it still has all the power
of the 2060 and then for your mini ITX
or small form-factor builds we have the
2060 mini ITX OC with the very short PCB
and a fun little cooler that keeps
things nice and small and I promise you
guys a monitor here it is this is the
Auris a deep to 7qd the spec list on
this monitor is quite impressive
although they put it in a very dark room
so I think you guys the best look at it
that's a qHD so 2560 by 1440 when it
comes to the resolution 10 bits IPS
panel is what it's rockin 10 bit it's
going to give you excellent color depth
actually covers 95% of the DCI p3 color
space which is very impressive and has a
bunch of gaming features as well that I
can show you for instance you can do on
screen display that's handled by the
monitors firmware so your computer and
your game has no idea that you're doing
stuff like placing a reticule in the
middle of the screen or putting on
screens but stats that you can put up in
the corners the monitor is free sync to
compatible so you can use adaptive sync
with AMD graphics cards no word on
whether or not Nvidia is going to
approve this monitor for use with their
newfangled g-sync on free sync monitors
thing that might be a thing in the
future but in they would have to
independently review this so unique
thing this monitor can do that I have
never really seen a monitor view before
is active noise-cancelling so that means
that you would plug your headset or your
microphone
into the monitor itself then the monitor
has three microphones that are right in
there as well so they had a demo going
on where they had us come over here put
on some noise cancelling headphones and
then put on some earbuds underneath that
and then they put a bunch of loud stuff
going on in the other side of the room
and try to talk through it and the noise
cancellation actually worked really well
the mic that the audio from the voice
was coming through not quite so much but
you can see how this would work in a
crowded environment like it'll land
Center or if you just have very loud
keyboard it'll cancel those noises out
so if you're talking over teamspeak or
if you're live streaming you won't hear
the background noise that's pretty nice
all this can be controlled with the
Auris software and you can also do
different levels for the active
noise-cancelling high very high medium
low or very low and yes you can plug in
your own mic if you want but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for my coverage here at
the gigabyte Horus booth let me know
what you think of these new products
down in the comments section below and
of course thank you for watching my CES
2019 coverage and a big thank you to my
sponsors for this event once again enter
max Coolermaster deep cool and Corsair I
got more videos coming at you real soon
