Pauls hardware today's video is going to
be about using the new AMD RX 480 in
ultrawide monitor configuration so 2560
by 1080 or 30 440 by 1440 the reason I
decided to do this video was I just got
through about two weeks of pretty much
constant GPU benchmarking I did the 1070
the 1080 as well as our X 480 so running
that many benchmarks in succession can
cause your brain to sort of start to
melt a little bit and I lose the ability
for abstract thought so I thought hey
for today let's keep things a little bit
more informal let's actually have me
play the games rather than just run a
few short benchmark segments that I run
through over and over again and I got a
configuration set up back here to show
you guys the ultrawide monitor while
also showing the real time at benchmarks
and frame rate as I run the games so
here's my testing area where I have
spent way too much time over the past
couple weeks over on the left is just
the streaming system I use that to do
some capturing and whatnot and then the
testbed which is right here which is of
course outfitted with the AR X 480
running nice and quiet if you hear any
noise right now it's probably the actual
DES fan for the CPU which is running at
a much higher rpm because my CPU is
overclocked to 4.4 gigahertz and I
haven't bothered to go in and adjust
that fan speed very much to be honest
anyway at 21 by 9 monitor this is a soup
redditor x 34 so 34 40 by 1440 is a
native resolution I can also run it at
2560 by 1080 and I am going to be
capturing the gameplay not directly on
the system because I think that would
affect the actual benchmarks but I'll be
capturing it directly with my camera
here and then I've also outfitted a
little ol webcam right there just a
Logitech c920 that's going to be
pointing at the area of the screen where
the actual framerate shows up using msi
afterburner and the overlay that you can
set up on there that is my setup though
I'm going to start playing some games I
think we'll start off with some GTA v
also gots a doom loaded up and then I'll
don't choose another random one to throw
in there to starting out with some Grand
Theft Auto 5 here I'm at the lower
resolution 2560 by 1080 right now and
I'm trying to hit my hundred Hertz
refresh rate frame rate for this so I
actually started out with everything set
up to very high like I do with my
we'll benchmark comparisons but out to
the turns with stuff down and I'm doing
a little bit better I'm getting closer
to the mid to upper-90s
I try to adjust a few more things here
in the graphic settings see if we can't
get it up over a hundred doing a little
bit better now up over a hundred
averaging so that's that's pretty sweet
so in order to hit a hundred frames per
second I basically did the settings like
so 2560 by 1080 I was actually pretty
okay hitting about 60 frames per second
at least 55 to 60 with my Albury high
settings like I usually do in a
benchmark but to hit 100 I had to
basically turn msaa off I also turned
the shader quality shadow quality
reflection quality down to high as well
as water particles and grass so most of
these I keep it very high I just switch
them down to high and now got that extra
frames per second cut inside right there
oh oh no no
yes indeed you tell them Franklin to see
I'm strategically adjusting the velocity
of my vehicle by crashing into these
signposts at regular intervals Oh
goddamnit I do not take those walls very
well
oh come on they're a totally I see the
guys in front paid the guys in back to
sandbag me oh you son of a bitch you son
of a bitch oh my god Wow
oh shit no
oh I'll thank God for the vapid bullet
there we go
exit though let's switch back to 334 40
by 1440 don't forget that get there
first straight back up 200 Hertz we do
it and see how this goes
now I haven't switched my settings back
to very high and everything because I
just I know that I'm not going to hit
that's those same numbers at this
resolution so already were tricked we've
dropped down to 69 to 70 this I would
say would be a good setting for 34 40 by
1440 with this graphics card because at
least if you're going for 60 Hertz or 60
frames-per-second see if I can make some
more adjustments though and get back up
to 100
your FIV buddies they know you're back
in business
FIV buddies what are you talking about I
checked out the WPP thing it doesn't
look like any WITSEC program I'm aware
of
the captain's do
first off I'm going to have a difficult
time talking while I play this game
second operat flirty a little over 30
frames per second also that is not in
the right place so you guys can't see
what frames per second is okay we're 34
40 by 40 and 40 right now I just started
and with that's ultra look doing hey
we're hitting between 30 and 40 per
second right now is pretty much where
we're at
help
still not getting that great of a
framerate
No
it was actin finicky but I've gotten it
to run at 2560 by 1080 so I am getting
much higher frame rates and now around
100 a hundred frames per second mark it
sometimes goes above that sometimes dips
a little bit below but as far as
settings go I'm still set to the low
settings or actually yeah mostly low
have to put AF at 2x I guess this is
where we're supposed to go
for my third game here I've chosen Tomb
Raider or rise of the Tomb Raider I'm
not doing DirectX 12 mode because I'm
not sure what that will do to my overlay
resolution starting out the 2560 by 1080
I'm gonna see how things go
if you'll trade love like nothing I'm
fine just trying to turn pure hair off
Oh God
a couple more settings changes
storms getting closer we have a couple
hours at most
should be enough time we're almost to
the top
I had some up above 60 frames per second
which is good I would be fairly
confident playing at this at these
settings if I was at a 60 Hertz monitor
this is 100 smarter though as I probably
already mentioned in this video so let's
try to jump up a little better let's try
the medium preset I can make it
I guess we died
she keeps doing that I think what I'm
going to do next is see if low settings
get us over 100 frames for seconds
still only at 80
there was something in Dad's research
about this
alright so switched up to Rebecca 3440
by 1440 now just kind of see what frame
rates would be like I'm still on the
lowest settings options and I'm hitting
about 45 to maybe in the most 50s starts
bring their skills
it's amazing
there were two here to get inside so
they have a guys from 21 by 9 gameplay
with the AR X 480 I would say 34 40 by
1440 was a bit more of a stretch for
this graphics card definitely had to
tune down the settings quite a bit to
get playable framerates
2560 by 1080 though very viable and
definitely would consider that as an
option for any of you guys we're looking
for both the new graphics card and a new
monitor hope you have enjoyed it I want
to know from you guys what you think of
this particular type of benchmark video
there's the more formal type where I run
a bunch of different cards and have very
strict settings for everything and then
I do charts and all that then there's
this where it's just like hey what
settings do I need to run at in order to
get this graphics card to play at this
framerate on this monitor resolution I
definitely see value to both
methodologies but it's difficult to do
them both in the same video so maybe
I'll just keep doing separate videos
with each different one anyway if you
enjoyed this video hit the thumbs up
button leave me that comment in the
comment section below and let me know
what you think and of course as always
