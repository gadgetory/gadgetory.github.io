back to Pauls hardware today I have a
fan video for all my fans out there it's
gonna be fantastic okay so these are 120
millimeter gentle typhoon fans and they
used to be available in the US as scythe
gentle typhoon fans but sigh the USA has
closed its doors so they're a bit harder
to come by these days they are designed
in Japan by night ech servo and I chose
these because they are optimized for
static pressure and quiet operation this
series is available in five hundred
eight hundred eleven fifty fourteen
fifty and eighteen fifty RPM versions
and this one is the 1,850 RPM variant
the box gives you all the info you could
want this is a 12-volt van with an
operational range of five to thirteen
point two volts twenty eight decibel
noise level and that is at full RPM so
running it slower keeps things much
quieter 58.3 CFM airflow 200 gram weight
which is pretty heavy for a fan and a
MTBF of one hundred thousand hours at 35
c which is a very long lifespan and
that's thanks to the double ball
bearings in the large central hub also a
2 year warranty when it's sold outside
of japan as it says here on the top of
the box ok so the box doesn't tell you
everything they did forget static
pressure but it is listed on their
website as 2.9 millimeters of h2o and
who knows why they don't slap that
impressive number on the box too but
there you go for accessories you get
four mounting screws and a three pin fan
to 4-pin molex adapter with a tachometer
lead for monitoring the RPMs the fan
itself is very utilitarian it's got a
simple but sturdy black plastic frame
unfortunately no padding on the mounting
points so I might consider some rubber
washers the blade assembly is gray and
has a very large central hub for the
double ball bearing motor as well as
nine blades with a very forward swept
looking design the version I got from
frozen CPU has a black braided 3 pin fan
cable with a white plug and it's only
about a foot or 31 centimeters long so
an extension might be necessary
depending where you're placing it in
your case next up I'm going to plug this
in with a speed regulator and give you
guys a sound test at a few different
speed levels alright guys so here's my
sound test and I was actually kind of
excited I get this digital sound level
meter here to do some sound testing with
but as you can see I have a position
very close to the fan right now this is
just about five inches away and the
reason I did this is because it's the
only way you can get this sound meter to
pick up this starts at 40 decibel hey
waiting and it's really the fans quieter
than that I'll be quiet for a second so
you can see the the readout on there but
you'll notice it really it's not showing
much of anything
as you can see it's just popping up here
and there maybe getting a little bit
over 40 40 41 decibels from that reading
and again that's a 5 inches away and the
actual rating from the box they're going
to have further away than that
so all I'm really going to have for the
rest of these ties because this is
full-speed I should mention that right
up front this is full speed test at 1850
rpms it's fluctuating between about 1825
and 1850 and I'm just going to go ahead
and put the sound meter away for the
rest of these and just use the mic and
let you guys listen to what it sounds
like at the other speeds
and that's going to wrap it up for the
fan speed test as you can hear pretty
much once you get it below about 80%
RPMs you essentially can't hear this at
all unless you have your ear right up
against it
and that's going to do it for this video
guys once again this has been the gentle
typhoons currently distributed by 9x
servo if you're interested I post a link
down into the in the video description
where I actually purchase these so you
guys can check it out don't forget to
hit the like button while you're down
there don't forget to subscribe to my
youtube channel
and keep your eyes peeled because I will
be using these fans in my personal
system and when I do my personal system
kind of rebuild I will be doing a video
of that and showing it to you on my
channel so that's why you should
subscribe of course but that's all for
this one have a fantastic day and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
