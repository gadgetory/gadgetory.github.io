start with disclaimers or videos that
are primarily focused around complaining
which means that I probably wouldn't
like this video that I'm making right
now because 1 i'm starting with a
disclaimer and to this video's i guess
largely going to be comprised of me
complaining about different things so
sorry for any of you guys who are
looking for something else today this is
just a vlog style video and it's
basically being made as a as a filler
video it's being made because i don't
have another video ready for today and
one of the things I've really been
trying to do on my channel is maintained
at least a somewhat reasonable release
schedule that is every tuesday i do live
show with kyle that goes up tuesday
evening and then I've been trying to do
videos regularly on Thursdays and
Saturdays as well that's kind of the
schedule i have in my head i haven't
advertised that a lot because that's
making a commitment commitment to making
a promise and I hate doing that when I
can't keep the promised or at least I'm
relatively sure that I'm going to keep
the promise before I barking upon making
this video I threw up at Twitter a poll
to see what people actually wanted to
see for me when I actually encounter
situations like this where it's Thursday
I want to post a video today I don't
have a video ready and I have the option
of either throwing something together
like this or not posting a video and
that's really what the like the dilemma
comes down from two for me a lot of the
time is there's two kind of philosophies
that you can go with when you're making
YouTube videos one is that I make really
good videos and I'm only going to post
those videos when they're ready to go
there's a lot of tech youtubers who who
do this and you know to great effect and
I definitely have a lot of respect for
that I want to all my videos to be well
made and you know concise and have sexy
V roll and you know have them edited
well so that they're punchy and all that
kind of stuff but you know making that
type of videos it takes time it takes
and and you know due to no lack of
effort on my part for this week I have
been preparing several videos but none
of them are ready so anyway though the
straw poll that I put up was very close
but I'm apparently about forty percent
of you were interested in watching me
complain about stuff so that's the video
you're getting despite me having a very
strong second place contender of me
sorting my screw collection we will have
to save that riveting content for
another date so the way I've been making
videos generally speaking has been that
on mondays i will work on a project i
have an editor Joe who I have been
working with and I will send him over
the footage ideally sometime on Monday
maybe maybe tuesday morning and then he
will do some editing beyond that I will
work on another video that I will edit
to post on like thursday and then he'll
send me the stuff over later in the week
and i will post that video that he is
edited on saturday which has been
working pretty well and helping me keep
up to speed definitely having one of my
videos week edited by somebody else
saves me a decent amount of time but it
doesn't mean that i need to get
everything prepared for him so what
initially started me on having a bad day
today was the fact that last night i
encountered some issues specifically
with this new corsair keyboard now these
are being addressed but with corsair
this is the new k70 rapid fire by the
way and i do have a video that should be
up on this review probably come in this
weekend now the keyboard itself has been
great it's been fantastic but the issue
i was having was actually connecting the
keyboard with the software the corsair
utility engine software or q and it just
it wasn't recognizing over and over
again tried last night's failed try
again this morning failed some more
finally I was able to tweak it around
and get it to work but that meant that
this morning rather than doing what I
was supposed to do which was work on
today's video which was going to be
either a continued update or continued
review of the master liquid pro 2 40
from coolermaster which I am also midway
through the review on or it was going to
be
a well a continuation of the work I've
done on the review for this the razor
ripsaw which is a external USB 3.0 it's
a capture card so you can use it to
capture game footage or capture like
camera footage over to your computer via
USB three-point again like in the works
but not ready and you know I got to do
the proper testing and everything before
they are ready to go the other thing
that I have had arrived which I'm really
excited about is my vibe and again this
being a kiddie aware i'm complaining
about stuff i constantly feel terrible
complaining about anything because look
I have a vibe now and that's pretty damn
exciting I'm super excited about the
vibe and please don't get me wrong I'm
I'm constantly thankful for what I do
for a living and for the access that I
have to the technology because it's it's
really lots of fun I'm also is always
thankful for the dogs down there resting
peacefully I'll look at nurse she's
stretching she's stretching and that
cute okay she felt like sleep anyway
though I'm so yeah I guess what I'm
saying is despite all my complaints in
this video about things not going right
I I guess I try to maintain that just
that mentality that you know I'm always
thankful for what I what I do and what I
wouldn't you know the opportunities that
have been presented to me and all that
stuff anyway um the other things that
went wrong this morning this along with
the corsair keyboard not playing nice
with the software was i have some ebay
sales that I just did recently I don't
usually advertise my ebay sales I and I
have weird the issues about actually
selling stuff to fans who knows maybe
I'll figure out some other means of
doing that in the future but I i did
some ebay sales they were you know they
completed and i was shipping stuff this
morning and basically there's a shipping
snafu with a case that i had sold and i
ended up having to pay like 80 bucks to
ship it would you basically memilih I
had like wasted my time even bothering
to list it or anything because it that
was like the shipping cost more than the
sale of the case and the shipping that
was paid for it
so yeah like I lost like 10 bucks for
all of my work taking pictures and
posting it and all that kind of stuff
anyway that was a complaint and then the
other complaints I could just continue
my complaints is that my my email server
my my my web service is being like dee
da straight now not like me specifically
but the entire service which meant that
my my email is like down this morning so
I can't even like continued
communication with people about like
getting stuff lined up for computech
sponsorship and all that good stuff so
yeah that's kind of where I'm at as far
as what i have going on what I'm working
on I don't have any lack of content I
don't have any lack of stuff to talk
about it's just it's not ready it's not
ready to go right now and this morning I
came to a point where I had spent so
much time trying to catch up to the
other stuff where I came around to like
all right let's work on the video now
and I just know I know sometimes that
there's not enough time today to finish
the testing I need to do get the footage
done that I need to do and get something
edited and uploaded because it's it's
time consuming so that is why i opted it
again to do a video blog of me
complaining about things not working out
right and i don't know either you guys
will extend sympathy to me in the
comments or everyone will just be like
get you down topping your Paul cuz
you know you have a pretty cush job that
lots of people would really enjoy doing
so um step it up or someone else is
going to take your place that's that's
the idea that I get I'm like yeah
there's lots of people and that's the
other thing I mean right I'm just I
don't like talking like this I really
don't but I'm gonna let myself do it so
like I follow lots of other tech
youtubers out there and it can be very
frustrating sometimes to feel like some
people can just go and like be like
right I'm just going to turn the camera
on and start talking and make a video I
don't know whether it's me being
self-conscious or me being concerned
that like no one wants to hear that kind
of stuff or what I don't know I know
what it is but I have I have a hard time
making even like a video like this just
turning on the camera and I even know
when I'm editing this in a few minutes
I'm gonna be watching it back and be
like this
no one cares about this garbage stop
complaining Paul anyway that's that's
how I keep myself Desai keep up with my
work ethic is apparently giving my house
myself a hard time and but you know what
if it ends up being that my my trials
and tribulation this lead to me making
better video videos in the future then
who knows hopefully that will be a
positive outcome I don't know anyway I'm
just to reinforce one last time the fact
that I live a privileged life and I
don't deserve to be complaining about
anything I will end by giving you guys
won hopefully the last pre-build tour of
the hardware that I have for my wife's
water cool build those are the two this
is the two videos that I'm most excited
about doing right now I need to take
care of the other commitments the
product reviews that I've agreed to do
but I'm really most excited about the
water cool build for my wife and HTC
vive but I am the kind of person where I
don't want to skip what I've got lined
up to jump to those because I know just
back me up more in the future I gotta I
gotta do a B and C before I move on to D
and E I guess is what I'm saying so I
already kind of gave a rundown of all
the EK stuff because they sent me just a
pile of things all the radiators pump
reservoir all the PTT tubing back there
as well as a kit that I'm going to need
to use in order to cut the tubing and
bend it properly and all that kind of
stuff Kingston just provided this stuff
here which I'm super super stoked about
so we got hyperx fury ddr4 memory this
is a 2 x 16 gig kit 32 gigs tool in two
sticks it's pretty nice also the HyperX
savage this is a 960 gig 2.5 inch SSD
yeah great nice fast SSD 960 gigs so
that will be this isn't even going to be
the main drive no the main drive is
going to be the predator right here for
turn 80 gig hyperx predator it's not in
nvme drive so there are faster i'm two
drives out there but this one's still
pretty damn fast especially compared to
SATA drives it does fourteen hundred
megabytes per second read and thousand
megabytes per second rights so yeah
that's pretty nice I got the power
supply which is a silverstone
the 80 plus platinum strider series st
75 f dash PT I got this one because it's
fully modular and it's only a hundred
and forty millimeters deep which is
great for the Nano s case since there's
not a whole lot of room there these are
all my fittings and whatnot for me k and
then finally I have added a flow
indicator right there which I just think
these are fun and I told my wife I would
put one in there so she was interested I
did grab thanks to all the people who
put comments about these things this is
a USB 3.1 so I'm going to be since the
USB 3.0 on my motherboard is kind of in
an awkward place this will help keep it
much more low-profile and help it blend
in a little bit more so that's just an
extension than that since we are going
with orange I have two versions of
orange dye here for both from primo
chill as well as for mayhem I will test
these and various combinations and see
what provides the best result when it
comes to orange liquid flowing through
the system anyway guys again those three
products already showed you the HTC vive
all this stuff video is coming very soon
once i get off my ass get back in gear
and start taking care of that's
what i'm going to do anyway hopefully no
more complaining videos like this one in
the future but hey if you happen to like
me complaining hit the thumbs up button
and if not and just enjoy enjoy the
peaceful bliss of hero down here
sleeping sleeping quietly snoring he is
actually a pretty big snore he already
wanna say hi say hi to people oh look at
him he just wants pets you just want
pets don't true hero that's it anyway
thanks for watching this video guys and
we'll see you next time bye hero</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
