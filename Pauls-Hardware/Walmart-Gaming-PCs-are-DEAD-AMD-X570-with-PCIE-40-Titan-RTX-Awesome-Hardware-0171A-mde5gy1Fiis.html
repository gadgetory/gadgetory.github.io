method that's why that's how they don't
have any copyright violations I'll tell
you where they were hamsters the keepers
my patent patent infringement the
hamsters you'd be surprised
lately hamsters are more like the
backbone of the internet yeah yeah their
would make most hoops most Linux
machines they run running through the
two are powered by hamsters or the data
back and forth and a yeah well there's
different amps just different hamsters
for different tasks certain some
hamsters carry the data back and forth
right other hamsters spin the wheels
just to generate power yes science
obviously and some just just sit around
don't do anything just taking those are
the supervisors you have to have
somebody who's calling the shots hey
guys how's everyone doing welcome this
is awesome hardware this is a live show
we discuss technology to talk about
computers and computer parts and what's
new with computers and we stream every
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific to twitch TV / awesome hardware
as well as our YouTube channels my
channel Paul's hardware as well as
Kyle's channel bit wit we're streaming
the first half of episode number 171
right now
it's December 4th 2018 and we have much
important news to discuss with all of
you today but first a word of warning we
do drink beer on the show and we
occasionally use adult language you know
sometimes we curse like sailors tales
demonstrating right now so mind your
ears and if you have any young ones then
please send them away in case you're
wondering we're currently drinking
Lagunitas brown sugar which is 10
percent which is a 10 percent but these
are the last of them so we're we're
finishing that off gonna be a long show
finishing that off and one more thing to
note before we dive right oh we click on
those things now before I dive into the
show proper a quick note that we do have
stores where we sell merchandise
unashamedly branded with our logos upon
it and it's all super nice though
Holiday Sale going on right now if you
order over fifty bucks worth of stuff
you get 10% off if you order
over 100 bucks worth of stuff you get
20% off the more you buy the more you
save
I feel like Jensen that the load about
the cool other jackets we do have some
new products these awesome hardware we
actually just saw the the new awesome
Hardware shirt in the flat in the flesh
at our family tup this past weekend this
is actually real cool design it was made
by JTED and submitted to us and now we
have plastered it on some gaming desk
mats and some hoodies and some shirts
and stuffs you know fans showed up to
our fan meetup when that shirt and we
had never seen it in person yeah we've
not only seen that as where did you get
that he's like from you yeah super nice
love your shirt pause harbor net net is
mine store bit wit that tech slash store
is Cal store or bit with doctor or just
bit with tech and he's got the same deal
going on 10% off orders over 50 20
percent off over orders over 100 and he
also has this new design at the eat bit
Boyd last year new batch stuff also
available on a variety of products it's
adorable so good it's me check it out
buy some stuff if you do buy stuff or if
you happen to donate during the live
stream we will be reading off your
donation comments and also thanking you
for buying stuff during the after party
which is linked in this video's
description
attach a message to your donation and
even any message you want yeah within
reason
that'll be great alright let us dive
into some technology news first off wait
I didn't I didn't do the lower thirds
and then do the lower thirds there there
okay alright first off we have a rumor
from WCC F Tech in the leaks and rumors
category so you know obviously this
could all be lies that we are spreading
right now green disseminating but this
is all about
AMD's next generation of products and
it's it's fairly exciting if true of
course it true the rumor was actually
from a website a Taiwanese website gamer
comm TW and this a one-team W yeah I
believe T W is Taiwan I think pretty
sure sounds I'm 95% sure of that yeah
but yeah here's a slide slide apparently
these slides are from a gigabyte
presentation it's a slide it must be
true not directly from AMD but gigabyte
of course works with AMD and makes
motherboards and such and this has a
bunch of stuff like about current socket
and for stuff but also upcoming socket
name for stuff so right now we can see
the stuff
second half 2018 that's right now and
all this stuff is currently available
Raven Ridge gonna clear it all out on in
the next-gen and I don't know why this
is blocked out this is blocked out right
here but socket and for for the next
generation is codenamed Matisse are the
CPUs themselves are codenamed Matisse
3000 series
Verizon CPUs codename Matisse they're
supposed to be seven nanometers n2 based
processors that means not only we got a
die shrink from 12 nanometer down to
five from 12 nanometer down down to
seven five nanometer shrinkage shrinkage
I can relate is what they used to call
me a nice that's a I mean
percentage-wise that's I mean if you
look at that's a that's a lot of
shrinkage going on it is right there
but shrinkage in Swiss sea views is a
good thing so not just the die shrink
also the Zen too so if we if you look at
Zen stuff and Zen plus stuff the 1000
series of right into the 2000 series of
Rison that there's more incremental
updates there this is an actual refresh
of the core architecture so there still
remains much to be seen like I said
still much in the rumor and speculation
category but both of those things
together could potentially mean that
Andy's might have some pretty
competitive products coming out here
especially when you look at the
stagnation that's happened on the Intel
side with they're still delayed until
2019 ten nanometer products so other
interesting stuff about this leak again
if true is that they're still sticking
with the am for socket I was kind of
surprised about that they promised
support for a m4 through 2020 so I guess
that makes some sense but I wouldn't
have been surprised for them to say like
well that's our rise into stuff and
we're gonna support like our resident is
that we're going to support that through
2020 but now here's the next generation
of stuff that's cool we're more badass
they're committed to the customer
according
this still a.m. for socket still
backwards and forwards compatible so you
have a x5 70 chipset motherboard to
replace the current generation of x4 70
ships at motherboards but you could take
a 2700 X and slot it into a and AM for
x5 70 motherboard and it would work
likewise you could take potentially
again if true the 3000 series processors
which will still be aimed for and slot
them into an X 370 motherboard or an X
470 motherboard however you would lose
support for a lot of the features of the
next generation of products including
PCI Express Gen 4 hub which is a pretty
which is pretty significant it's a big
one that's a biggie yeah yeah there's
PCI Express Gen 4 still in the works
we're expecting a pretty big bump up in
bandwidth much like the jump from PCI
Express Gen 2 to Gen 3 and this would
also theoretically mean that this is
going to be the first generation of
consumer products to support PCI Express
Gen 4 which would be another kind of
like feather and AMD's cap for the stuff
they've been doing recently right I mean
I think that's a that's a pretty big
thing for AMD to be able to say is that
they're if they're actually going to be
to Intel to the market with with support
for that so that's cool too yeah of
course
PCI Express Gen 4 is the type of thing
that you'll have to have support for on
the desktop platforms as well as
products to slot in there so we'll have
to be looking at like the next
generation of graphics card or an actual
product that is PCIe gen 4 but for
compatibility you know I don't complain
about that other interesting thing about
this is the expectation is potentially
that it will launch its Computex 2019
Computex happens at the beginning of
June every year in Taiwan and that would
also mean that what we talked about last
week
AMD's Epic Rome processors which are
also seven nanometers and two products
AMD has promised will be the first seven
nanometer products to launch so if we're
expecting rise in 3000 series at
Computex that logic would indicate that
the epic processors would probably
prior to that sure so that might be a
little bit more information on when to
expect those legit I wouldn't be
surprised to see some more stuff on that
at CES which is the beginning of January
but hopefully more on that once next
month I guess there is talk of up to 15%
instructions per clock per fruit it
reprove moment performance improvement
with this next generation of CPUs so
that's pretty exciting too again process
shrink in the new architecture so and
then the last note in the article that
also thought was was worth pointing out
is that they said they're also aiming to
fix and improve upon the memory
controller by reducing the memory delay
and allowing a better support for higher
frequency lower latency memory so an
improved support for lauralee instant
memory is good that's been one of the
kind of sticking points with Rison as
you always have to be like I'll make
sure you get the compatible memory so
you can work and get it running at the
higher speed wider compatibility much
like with Intel where you often don't
have to worry about what kit you're
getting would also kind of narrow the
gap between their platforms so that's
good cool cool all-around exciting good
news again if true speaking of what may
or may not be true according to Ivan and
bear in mind this is Ivan he's very
trustworthy generally speaking as
nickname is crazy Russian he's that old
could he be trustworthy and interesting
this was posted by Linus tech tips
they're looking over at walmart.com at
the overpowered gaming desktop PCs never
ISM these overpower gaming desktop PCs
are infamous infamous ever since Linus
tech tips broke the news that they suck
lies tech tips first on the scene
reporting about these Walmart you know
supposedly really good gaming PC's and
last Texas was like no we're here to
report the truth to people first of all
we're gonna be we're gonna break this
story and they got a lot of traction
from that they were they were the first
I'm joking of course Kyle brought this
up now I feel like I know I feel like
one of my own viewers who comments first
after sanity video that's just been
posted to take credit for being first
because I technically won
the first to make a video about the
Walmart gaming pcs however I will give
credit where it's due Steve from gamers
Nexus was the first to actually post a
video about the PC with with the app
physically in hand I was just making
speculation although I I retract part of
that credit because I was first to
publish a video online about a physical
Walmart PC because of I was on
floatplane that it was on flat plain
days before
Steve's video ever went up on you to see
the only way people would have known
that is if they subscribe to you on
floatplane you must give me more money
and then you can no more knowledge is
money knowledge is money now you owe me
part of your floatplane money for for
putt for promoting your floatplane
channel and my channels get a 15% Oh
beautiful maybe I should finally follow
up on that since I've been on the hook
for like eight months to supposedly sign
up for that we have it nevermind
point being these Walmart pcs are called
overpowered gaming desktops and reports
of their crappiness have been embraced
by and large by the gaming community
because anytime you have a large company
trying to do something and they do a
crappy job at it
you know point pointing and laughing is
a fun thing to do but more more more to
the point there is a public service in
here because if you have somebody
shopping at Walmart who's like oh this
PC gaming thing my my kid has been
talking about fortnight or whatever them
they want to play and they want a gaming
PC Oh Walmart has one they could easily
be duped into buying a very low quality
product over paying for the hardware
that's actually included and there are
many many faults in these systems
pointed out in both Kyle's videos as
well as gamers Nexus video which now has
2.6 million views so you guys have
probably already all heard this before
and then of course science has also
followed up and done a video on that as
well now the original story that we're
going to be talking about right now is
that Walmart his head apparently
canceled these overpowered gaming
desktops and they took them off the
website and they weren't for sale
anymore they're back but as is often the
case as we try to talk about something
on the live show they are now back so
Wow
I'm just refresh it I just refreshed but
I guess you could get an overpowered
gaming desktop
DTW one and pick that up on Tuesday
December 11th in Irvine
wait that's cheaper than it was yes they
dropped the price by 200 bucks don't you
feel bad for buying it at the full pray
did ya and I do how dare they this come
I feel like changes everything I
received some credit doesn't Walmart in
store right now something you can call
them and complain I will call complain
go right now record the conversation did
the whole thing until you get them to
like offer you the refund for it and
then and then dropped it oh by the way
I'm the one who did about your crappy
pcs so the speculation earlier today was
that Walmart had dropped them as a
result of all as a negative flack and
feedback however that does not seem to
be the case so that kind of changes the
the slant of the surge by a question
later on but that's fine don't worry
about it never mind but like I said
Steve's Steve's video so gamers Nexus
video and this is it - almost 2.7
million would you also brought that
single video just to give some
perspective here a video that goes this
big for a channel as as largest gamers
in excess they grew almost a hundred
thousand subscribers within a month they
were close to like 370 370 K before they
posted this video and now they're at 460
basically so congratulations I mean huge
shout to say even then the team over
deserve it that's an absolutely massive
massive gains they're awesome this is
the story of the like late November
early December YouTube gains has been so
many stories of that we had you know bps
custom sprain yeah our friend he'd want
drew Polly just way up from from the the
giveaway that just ended yesterday yep
by the way if you entered in the
giveaway that coordinated giveaway that
me Kyle and PPS customs did you may
check your email because emails were
sent out last night and you've got 48
hours to respond to indeed but anyway
point being don't buy gaming PC from
Walmart and
I guess that's how we can you might not
even get the right PC yeah all right
other news this week the NVIDIA Titan RT
x video card has now been announced
confirmed it's supposed to be available
for sale this month the launch is
December 2018 I don't know if they're
actually available for sale and videos
website or anything like that but
there's an entire tackle linked in this
video's description all my articles I'm
discussing today by the way I linked in
the description if you guys are
interested and yeah this is a this is a
massive beastly $2,500 graphics card the
Titan r-tx
this was expected but it also kind of
crept up I don't know if you were
watching video YouTube channels tech
channels you may have spotted it because
there were several leaks in the past
week yeah Jay's $0.02
Lake is like oh this RT X happens to be
in my video usually on the Linus had his
in in the wind show and popped it out
there I saw a the slow mo guys
tweeted a picture with like this the
computer they had in the background that
said Titan on it so these cards were
sent out early and NVIDIA apparently
gave people the okay to like leak them
teased them like T's I guess that it's a
if it's a leak would be like
unauthorized righties I guess would be a
more accurate word that's true it's true
so it doesn't seem as as as dirty now
right when you had all it at ease we
were hoping to title this episode J's 2
cents exposed I know but then people
would just think we had nudes of little
J's that would kind of benefit in any
way that would kind of be a tease as
well that's absolutely there depends on
who you ask
yeah really really does definitely a
tease for me anyway though if you have
2500 dollars to spend and he wants the
highest end graphics card now available
this Titan RDX has 4608 cuda cores 576
tensor cores
it's got a base clock of 1350 megahertz
in a boost of 1770 I imagine there'll be
people overclocking this as well it's 24
gigs of GDD are six memory not HBM two
by the way so not like the HBM to that
the Volta is using so somewhat
interesting there the HP m2hb M&amp;amp;H PM to
thing didn't seem to take off I'm
wondering how much of that has to do
with the success of Vega hmm
or just continued availability there but
boy being 24 gigs of DDR 614 gigabit per
second that's a 384-bit interface so he
got 672 gigabytes per second total
memory bandwidth there's a six megabyte
l2 cache the GPU itself is still the tu
102 so that still is the same GPU as the
2080 TI this one's just fully unlocked
with all the cuda cores 4608 vs 4352
with the 28 e TI founders edition so so
there you go
RK xbox r-tx titan being nicknamed the
t-rex which kind of makes sense cuz
there's a tee and an RN and X in the
name yeah Titan RT x t-rex and it's kind
of a cool nickname so I feel I'm not
sure if I should endorse it single
precision throughput of 16.3 teraflops
double precision compute performance I
think this is right I just can't wait to
see the SLI benchmarks yeah I don't know
that is sorry so you actually for double
precision you're still better off with a
Titan to be apparently because you've
still got a lot more double precision
floating point yeah this is this is this
is part of how they differentiate like
their Quadro cards and stuff from these
10 cards but um yeah hundred and thirty
teraflops with tensor performance that's
up from 57 for the 2080 Ti so the holy
moly pretty huge jump and also up from
110 from the Titan V damn so cool turned
an 80 watt TDP as well that's what's
kind of surprising to me because the
Titan V was like a big a big is a big
triple slot card right you
this is supposedly a 30 watt 30 watt
greater TDP 280 Watts versus 250 also
280 Watts versus 260 on this awesome et
angle salon but it's also still the ones
I've seen are still that same dual slot
cooler looks like a 20 vti it looks
exactly like the 2080 I found really
interesting was I and that cooler has
already been proven to like I mean it's
not bad cooler but you know it's better
they're better right anyway so there you
go there's a rundown of the 1090 X
moving on them nuts so chromium
Microsoft is building a chromium powered
web browser and they're finally
apparently giving up on edge or
continuing to develop the web browser
the sort of core web web browser that
edge became after they moved on from
Internet Explorer so what's what's a
chromium again so chromium Cromer says
chromium essentially chromium is like
open source core web browser chrome is
Google taking chromium and sort of
making it fancy Google version I see so
you can you can get you can get chromium
by itself and you have a very bare bare
bones web browser with a lot of speed
and sure functionality and stuff that
you would you expect if you've ever used
chrome before right chromium is just
open source and stuff so chrome is
Google's take on chromium so whatever
Microsoft calls this browser will be
Microsoft's take on chromium so dumb I
will dumb I mean okay I I feel like I'm
so like I'm so apathetic now towards
Microsoft being able to make a
functional and easy to use and efficient
web browser
I remember when Windows 10 was first
coming out everyone was like the they're
ditching Microsoft or Internet Explorer
it's gonna be this new thing called edge
and like everyone got their hopes up and
I even I was like kind of excited and an
edge came out and it completely blew and
I felt like at that point I just I was
like Microsoft no matter what tools you
give them they
they'll take chromium and they'll make
it their own Microsoft II way and
they'll basically just turn it into
another edge like that's that's that's
what deep down I feel like is gonna
happen
I hope they prove me wrong and that has
to be it's a viable alternative to be
fair and to play devil's advocate or
somebody like when was the last time you
used edge I've had to use edge here and
there in the last few months from
freshman up on an under compute like in
fresh installs when I have it installed
Chrome yet and I just got to use it for
certain things there was the other the
other day I had to use edge for
something I don't know the the download
speeds for a geforce driver took three
times as long on edge than it did with
Chrome or Firefox so that was this week
so I have used it recently and not been
happy with it it still sucks just as
much as I remember it but I hope I hope
they change so I will say that just in
my reading and browsing on the internet
I haven't used that very much myself but
I have I feel like I have read more edge
sort of like edge actually isn't that
bad sort of articles or people who are
discussing like what they've done with
it and think changes that they made to
it so I feel like edge is probably a
more palatable and acceptable web
browser than Internet Explorer ever was
but at this point they're obviously you
know trashing the core of the entire
thing and it's going to depend on what
they're able to do with their take on
chromium and if they're able to get
people to take advantage of it I I could
see some Benes benefits from this
because there's some I think there's
some there's some core security benefits
to it but overall I think I would I'm
just gonna be curious to see once
Microsoft actually launches this and
starts deploying it in Windows 10 or
whatever if people will distinguish it
based on or like even even know that
it's based on chromium and and find some
that that makes them a little bit more
amenable to trying it out because I know
there's a ton of people who would just
never even try edge because like I
always get it in an explorer right I
hate Microsoft web browsers there's
never gonna give this a chance
sure I'd be somewhat curious to see if
people
give a chromium powered web browser that
Microsoft makes do you know does the
article state if they're gonna keep the
edge name or if it's gonna be called
something else I would expect them to
rebrand it again because it's different
yeah and because like I said there's
there's enough people that don't like
edge that but there's no mention in the
article of the article because it
doesn't doesn't really confirm that it's
just an I think they're working on they
would need to rebrand it for sure yeah
if it is gonna be that much different it
needs to have a different name most
likely all right I'll give it a shot
I'll give a shot ten nanometer Intel
products are available now that's right
on uh in in the form of this ten
nanometer cannon Lake Nook oh the nOCA
and actually has gone up for sale so
cute at major US retailers now this is
this is somewhat significant potentially
maybe this might indicate that Intel is
having a bit more success with their ten
nanometer manufacturing process and
yields that they're able to do a wider
launch because prior to this there have
been some ten nanometer notebook
products based on this same processor
available but the fact that it's a
little more widely a little bit
available now to the point where they're
able to put it into these the looks and
sell them means that there's more of
them so they go Intel is obviously
completely fulfilled their ten nanometer
promise to sell ten nanometers stuff I
want to check the actual price of this
nook Intel box nuke eight i3c ysm one
nuke eight home mini PC with Windows 10
currently available at Amazon for five
hundred and forty dollars is this one of
the bare-bones ones that you've to
install your in memory and stuff how do
you tell I think for that price it
should include a yeah and ok and chums
for me it comes with memory comes with
yeah this is also contain so you got
memory installed so yeah this is a this
is a full computer do they not sell
anything else that's the only see the
only ten enemy or CPU there's no i-5
very sevens right now
in the Nook no this is the only CPU
that's currently available okay so there
it is
stats around screen again articles in
the description if you got to want to
read the whole thing but the a380 121
you is the actual product which is a two
core four thread processor two point two
to three point two gigahertz clock speed
base and boost and four megabyte cache
50 watt TDP so low-power processor it's
tied in with an AMD Radeon 540 GPU with
512 stream processors 32 texture units
16 RPS and 2 gigs of gddr5 memory the
one for sale there also you know they
can configure these in different ways
but the one person for sale there also
had 4 gigs of memory installed so yeah
to two aspects to the story one being if
you really want that Intel 10 nanometer
product you can buy it I guess to being
yes the potential implication of them
actually having a few more of these
available which might be a good
indication when it comes to the their
yields are improving the actual
fabrication process but then but then
the third sobering fact is that there is
no update or any indication that there
might be anything sooner on the desktop
side when it comes to socketed ten
nanometer Intel processors you know
because we're still not expecting those
until late 2019 it'd be interesting to
see this chip compared to a like a
comparative I 3 that's been in a
previous gen Nook just to see if there's
any difference there like like another I
3 you skew processor 2 cores 4 threads
the most comparable I believe in an tech
has done some testing on that with the
with the laptop that came out and sort
of trying to suss out the like like
what's your actual what's the amount of
processing power per core mm-hmm and per
second or whatever
and then you can sort of extrapolate
that to say well at this frequency you'd
get this much performance improvement so
if you get that core times 10 if there's
going to be a 10 core
you know Intel mainstream processor at
4.8 gigahertz then you should be able to
get X performance right so yeah there's
some of that that's that's gone on I
think but I don't have any of it to
reference right now so we will have to
wait so there so rather than do that
we're gonna just just have a nice easy
segue into our sponsor spot hey oh yes
Toshiba Toshiba has chosen to sponsor
and I have to apologize last week when
Kyle was saying Toshiba like that I was
like how that sounds like I don't want
anyone to be offended because you're
like putting on an affected Toshiba
accent but then people in the comments
were like actually that's how it would
sound it's like somebody said it so and
historically I was just trying to be
manually accurate and I'm half asian so
that's how my family pronounces and so
my grandfather pronounces it yes so this
is there OCC are c100 using their
in-house BICS flash and would you look
at that it's not there they're SSDs are
invisible no they're not they're
actually not invisible but they are so
good for the price that I have actually
sabic it'd napped this this particular m
dot 2 SS jeans and I've dropped it into
my own personal system one of the
personal rigs that we use here in the
office it's that good people this is the
first time I've ever taken a product out
of a sponsor spot to use in my own rig
really during a stream oh good
yeah so there it is yeah you showed it
right there at the RSC 100 in the system
that I'm giving away during the charity
livestream that I was supposed to
announce at the beginning of this
livestream but I didn't but I mean I can
announce nevermind oh that's it after
the sponsors but I still have my have to
point is you could potentially win one
during the livestream anyway all these
are based on toshiba's BICS flash
technology there's the RC 100 there's
also the TR 200 series of SSDs so check
those out yep links are in the
description big THANK YOU to Toshiba for
sponsoring awesome hardware thanks to
Shiva and making a high quality NAND
flash products
that are both fast and affordable what
you up alright okay we have one more
segment before we end my half of the
show and that is let's not put my busy
pretty good nope it my PC today guys
saris are accurate I know you're all
disappointed next week next week folks
show is supposed to be oh yeah what what
that's supposed to be sword fight it is
yeah it's our fight alright so we have
to sword fight questions sword fighters
we're Kyle and I argue about stuff and
then you guys vote and let us know who
was great starting off with the r-tx
titan now we already mentioned there's a
bunch of leaks and they were planted
Nvidia planted the leaks and sent out
some of these r-tx titans of people just
like hey you guys could accidentally
show this off prior to the official
announcement date so they were not leaks
I guess teases yeah they were teasers
they were teasers approved teasers we
want to pull you guys okay about what
you thought of them these are TX Titan
leaks or teases did they impress you
would they did they did they spread the
knowledge of the end the the existence
of this product and and seed that in
your mind so that in the future you
would potentially buy them or did you
see it did you see through it as the as
the shameless ploy it was to exploit
your your eyeballs by exposing them
exposing your eyeballs to this level of
exploitation what do you think how were
they were they fun new way to tease a
fool new product are we stupid and okay
um you know what I'm gonna say they were
stupid and I hated them because I am
super salty and the fact that I did not
get one and if I don't get something
that I want then whoever did get the
thing is dumb and the whole initiative
revolving around the thing that I didn't
get is also dumb so I'm gonna play the
card I'm gonna play the supersalty you -
Burkhardt and it's dumb and
because you know what things that I get
from from from people from companies
they're not done they're good they're
great because I'm happy
and you know I got the thing that I
wanted and I get to like mess around
with it I can do whatever I could just
let it sit there and collect us but at
least I got one I feel special you know
and screw all the other clubs you didn't
get one you know I feel superior like
I'm on a pedestal I got this cool thing
but when other people get the cool thing
that I want makes me feel like I've
fallen off the pedestal now of a sudden
they're on a pedestal and I'm I'm just
joke
like I'm just a regular guy and that
that rose me the wrong way you know I
want to feel I want to feel superior to
everyone else and so you know we've
clearly clearly it can't be the fact
that they're just better than me in some
way that that's why they got the product
it must be the fact that they are in
fact GPU shills there are their
marketing skills and they were clearly
paid off or were promised certain things
by the companies and they did not and
she acquire them from honorable gains
from honorable methods and because of
that they are shells okay I feel like we
learned more about Kyle from that answer
than we did about the actual SPX I stand
by everything I said but but and by I'm
going to respond with obviously the
retort which is that I thought they were
a fun way to tease a cool new product
you're only saying that cuz the only
other choice that's true I don't have
anything to add to that really all right
so wait let me think how am I gonna
argue that I should argue this see it's
really difficult you got excellent it
yes you actually have to think about
arguing your point so look I mean when
it comes to when a you're a marketing
person at Nvidia and you're like hey we
want to kind of spread the word about
this thing and you
you're not really given any marketing
dollars to spend to like buy ad space
because it'd be silly for a product like
this it's really a niche product it's
high-end and whatever so you're like hey
I've got a few samples I can send them
out what better way to kind of get a
little bit little buzz go a little word
of mouth and then like oh it
accidentally appeared on the wind show
like oh just shut up they're like Oh J
like how didn't I go it's just
accidentally in the shot and made it
through the editing process and didn't
cut it out or anything like that where
you are arguably no I am arguing for it
because it's it didn't sound out it's
like sarcasm you're you're you're saying
something that is obviously far out
there and absurd because people are
people see that and they out and they
instantly know what it is they know it's
planted no one thought that that was
just like actually accidental but they
saw it they or wherever it and so that's
you know that's a basic positive
marketing campaign and that's the best I
can do it
Thank You Man let's see what people
let's see this most people didn't notice
I I can I kind of like that that's
that's actually the the the worst thing
as an Nvidia marketing person that that
you could hear is that people I don't
like not that you hated it that you
didn't even care which is actually the
way I like to treat a lot of things that
I don't like just to yeah different but
at the same time did it really cost them
anything because it costs them a few
graphics cards that could have otherwise
sold for $2,500 apparently but but I
lost that one so short and chews you
drink your sucker the t's didn't cost
them anything because at the end of the
day J is still gonna do a video on the
Titan RT X Linus is still gonna do a
video on the Titan r DX
so they're still gonna get are still
gonna get featured in big ways with
dedicated videos and the T's itself was
just kind of like a bonus like a you
know people notice it that's great if
not then whatever it doesn't really I
mean we're still gonna get a video from
this guy and this guy and this guy so I
feel like they didn't really have
anything to lose they're just so if you
could if we could sum up this question
and
answer especially if anyone from in
videos watching I think what it boils
down to is that they should send up more
Titan RT X's to more youtubers yeah
because that would help them and be good
a big good think more people would
notice
certainly this poll shows that people
didn't notice in video so you should
just well I'll be honest I've never
never just I've never gotten a Titan I
have no Titans neither right zero to be
so spoiled at Newegg I could go into I
could go in when the Titans would come
in I'd just take them yeah I wouldn't
take me to I'd borrow them I burn we
returned all of them I would take them I
would take them they come in to get
photos take it I'd be like I'm just
gonna borrow that and then we'd like set
them up and test them and everything
back then I didn't even know what I had
yeah I didn't even know what I had I
would just take it home for the weekend
and now just have my way with it we're
all thirsty look at it look at that
someone told you you know Callie one day
when you have a million subscribers
everybody's still won't send you one of
these I would have I would have held on
to it you know i would i would have
cherished it every second with it that I
had no all right what are the question
here this one's we're gonna we're gonna
run through this quick because I'm going
a little over already but Kalyn Steve
when I made this drop old had killed
Walmart's gaming PC's and they were no
longer available for sale obviously
that's been proven false by the website
that we pulled up like like an hour ago
mm-hmm but we're still gonna argue this
were Kyle and Steve too brutal were they
too critical of Walmart's gaming PC's
and I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna
say no I'm gonna take that I'm gonna
since I get to choose an answer this
easy one I want to say no easy answer
obviously you know they're doing a
public service here they're trying to
show the quality of a product that is
the benefit of a Youtube reviewer of a
product as being able to get that first
look or that look at something before
you actually buy it and Kyle and Steve
both clearly showed that the Walmart
overpowered gaming PCs are inferior
products you don't get very much for
your money so they were very
straightforward and direct in that and I
think they did a public service
therefore no they were not too brutal
they were direct and honest Kyle
why were you wrong let me argue now
against myself Paul tell you yes even I
were so brutal to a fault
I'll be we were just trying to spread
the joy of PC gaming and you know
sometimes you can go too far as a
reviewer sometimes you just well you
know you get emotionally attached or
emotionally driven and sometimes your
emotions can carry you away you can get
carried away with your emotions and
suddenly it becomes more of a personal
video or personal piece than something
more objective and you know we are
reviewers at the other day but we're all
still human and sometimes those emotions
and subjective feelings can can creep
into our content and occasionally no
reviewer is perfect occasionally we let
those feels get the best of us and you
know if we're arguing for this straw
poll I will say that it's very likely
very possible that Steve and I could
have contracted some of that in you know
in our Walmart videos so Kyle would
would you like to apologize to Walmart
 no absolutely oh my god
no puss concludes all right results wow
it's a big spread oh Jesus how are you
so wrong we were so wrong here and your
assessment that should've stuck with my
original video there's no usually
there's I put a third option in there
you know like just for people who don't
who want to you know chaos and stuff but
I actually somehow as I was making this
straw poll like I hit some button and it
just popped up as like a that's fine
then all right speaking of that's fine
that's fine for this episode sure is for
this half of awesome Parker thank you
