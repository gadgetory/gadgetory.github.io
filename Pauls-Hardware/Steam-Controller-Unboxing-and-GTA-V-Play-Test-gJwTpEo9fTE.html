Paul's hardware I had a new product
arrived in the mail today or it was
dropped off by a friendly delivery
person and I decided to do a video on it
immediately because it's new and
exciting this is the steam controller
was just distributed like today to
people who pre-ordered it on Steam it's
available in wide release in stores on
November 10th but it also is an
interesting product because it completes
the Steam ecosystem for one you need not
just the hardware to run the steam OS
and the steam OS itself but also the
steam controller for the ideal living
game living livingroom gaming experience
but you also have a $50 wireless
controller with a built-in touchpad that
you can use for Mouse control so even if
you're not into the steam OS thing even
if you have a windows-based or even Mac
based gaming system set up already you
can use this to control that in your
living room and at 50 dollars it's very
competitive with some of the other
controllers out there on the market so
let's go ahead and get started with an
unboxing and then maybe I'll plug it
into the arctic panther there behind me
and do a quick demonstration so here's
the box for the steam controller it's
fairly it's it's actually all blue I
wasn't expecting a blue theme to be
going on here but as you can see steam
controller on the front sort of another
shot of it there on the back now this
requires a computer with the minimum of
Windows 7 Mac OS 10 dot 10 or steam OS
running the Steam client and a free
steam user account so you do have to
have a Steam account as well as the
hardware and let's just go ahead and get
this out of the box
starting by removing the sleeve and then
oh no there's tape here on the corner I
don't have my I don't have my my
unboxing knife handy so I'm using
scissors alright okay inside the box
assuming that you open it in the proper
orientation you have the steam
controller right there looking all
pretty it seems like fairly eco friendly
packaging you also get a couple double-a
batteries since it needs that to run the
little USB adapter so you plug that into
the computer and that gives you wireless
connectivity and that's pretty no that's
not quite it what else do we have
is this adapter ah aha it's got so if
you want to position the receiver
someplace like you don't want to just
plug it into the back here
computer you want to reroute it and
position it somewhere where it's going
to get a better signal it comes with
this little bit of stuff to do that
includes a USB cable all right that's
what you get in the retail box
controller itself double-a batteries
wireless receiver a little extendo cable
which is just a USB micro 2 standard
type a plug you can use that and it's
got a little sort of heavier piece right
here that you can sit on your desk and
plug that adapter into and that will
allow you to presumably if you assuming
the deep there I will allow you to get
yourself a little bit better positioning
for receiving the signal and I'm
imagining this is particularly gonna be
useful for anyone who's got their
computer kind of tucked away somewhere
let's move all this aside and take a
closer look at the controller itself so
for 50 dollars you get an ergonomically
designed controller it's got some sort
of mat patches on either side there it's
also got a glossy area there at the
front these pads right here or touch
pads so I'm the one on the upper right
here is going to be the one that you
primarily use instead of a mouse for
example so use your thumb around that to
guide the mouse across the screen and it
works
it sort of imitates the way a trackball
would work to some degree it also has
haptic feedback on that so it will
Rumble and I've actually rumbles
specifically where your finger is which
is unique I also have a joystick right
there which is a very similar joystick
to say for example the Xbox 360
controller steaming button at the top is
going to immediately launch steam if you
have your computer up and running play
and pause or forward and back buttons
what have you X Y a and B and all of
these buttons are individual
individually individually controllable
and adjustable using the steam software
so you can reassign those and
what-have-you
it's also got these little trigger pads
here on the inside so as you wrap around
as your fingers I'm kind of gripped to
click those you also have some some
triggers here at the front right there
don't feel too bad and then of course
your your bumper pads there at the top
and bottom so a similar layout and a
similar sort of button arrangement then
that you would get with say for example
an Xbox 360 controller and there they
are side by side if you wanted to give a
little comparison of the sizes however
you do get the addition of those those
touch pads at the top and I think that's
one of those things that people will
find very interesting and useful also
nice that they've distributed the weight
from the batteries a little bit better
whereas with Xbox 360 you got this pack
it's right there in the middle with the
steam controller they've moved that off
to the side let me go ahead and pop
those on right now since I have it
available so little release thing there
pops that off that's again also is where
you have a couple buttons available via
those paddles and then we just got to
take our batteries and pop them in alike
so Dada oh and hey it already started up
and made a little little BP sound for me
there we go there's the steam controller
I'll put back together with the
batteries in and I will say with the
batteries in it gives a little bit more
heft a little bit more weight and oh oh
that's kind of fun it's not recognizing
that it's connecting to anything right
now but even as I just started pushing
it was already giving me the haptic
feedback but there's a quick unboxing
and assembly and a closer look at the
steam controller itself what I'm going
to do for you guys now is actually plug
this into my system back here and let's
give gta5 a shot I'm just loading up a
quick demo you guys and also sorry I'm
further away from my microphone now so I
might sound a bit more distance but I
got the controller dongle plugged in
steam ran an update and next up
immediately the text that you have this
the dongle for the controller plugged in
I'm going to turn the controller itself
on now as well and then it pops up and
says hey if you're using a steam
controller you might want to run big
picture mode because it thinks you're
going to try to do this in a living room
and big picture mode is kind of what
that's designed for you can tell not to
do that again if you don't always want
to run big picture mode if you're just
connecting it to a basic home system for
example I'm just going to hit close for
now but actually right now I do want big
picture mode because what that will do
is update the steams
of the controllers firmware since this
is like early run of this chances are it
doesn't eat firmware updates so I'm
going to tell it's update real quick and
then it's going to update new firmware
is being installed do not power it off
might take a minute bla bla so let's
give it a sec and then we'll come back
and show you how it works
so big picture mode is loaded up my
firmware update is finished and right
from the get-go I think this is one of
the things people are really gonna like
which is that the right track pad here
has a little bit of haptic feedback and
it works the mouse so as you can see
mouse cursor is on the screen and by
just rotating that around it actually
moves the mouse cursor around not too
difficult so I mean it works as you
might expect a trackpad - and that
little bit of feedback it gives right
underneath the touchpad is actually it
feels pretty good for kind of like
knowing that you're actually moving the
mouse around or whatnot of course you
can use other buttons on the controller
to navigate around a steam the steam a
less big picture mode as you might have
before but let's go ahead and go into
the library and play some GTA there we
go I think I'm curious about with GTA
with this game is that GTA is one of
those games that if you haven't watched
me play before when I had live streamed
or whatever I typically move back and
forth between using a controller which I
use when I'm driving because I find that
to be more effective means driving back
to mouse and keyboard whenever I'm on
foot whenever actually I have to aim and
shoot because I definitely prefer the
mouse to aim and shoot I don't think
this is going to take the place of a
mouse just for for accuracy when it
comes to aiming and shooting but I do
think that it might provide especially
for a playing from a livingroom
experience on the couch where you might
not necessarily have a mouse easily
accessible a nice kind of in-between or
you know a replacement for that but when
the mouse isn't as available
and I died okay um guys this is not
meant to be a full review of this
controller since I just got it I want to
spend a lot more time with it so first
impressions I like the feel of it it
doesn't feel I don't know durability
wise construction wise it's like on par
maybe just slightly less durable feel
than the Xbox 360 controller but again
I've only just barely started to use it
I like the feel of it it's definitely
comfortable to use positioning of the X
Y a B here is a little bit you have to
get used to going towards that at first
and then the trackpad here has different
functions so depending on what you're
doing
the trackpad might act a different way
so in some in some cases it tries to
mimic the analog the right analog stick
and in other cases it tries to mimic
like a mouse for example I will say that
when aiming with this right now was
pretty difficult especially when you're
comparing it to mouse or a keyboard
it was defaulting to the auto aim thing
in GTA 5 which is like okay by me but
honestly it you know you want the
accurate position of the aiming the one
thing from the reviews I've read of this
so far is that there's a learning curve
to it getting used to using it in
different situations getting used to win
you know this is going to act like a
mouse versus otherwise but guys that's
all for this video this is the steam
controller I will be doing some more
coverage on this some more coverage on
the steam machines I actually want to
put together steam machine and run the
steam OS on here so I can give you guys
more feedback on my experience of that
thanks for watching this video don't
forget to hit the like button subscribe
to my channel for more videos just like
this one or if you're interested in what
I've got going on in my garage here
since it is a work in progress things
are looking better but I still have some
unfinished touches as you might notice
thanks for watching though and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
