welcome to my build of the month for
August 2018 this is a mini ITX build
with a be 450 motherboard so it's built
for reisen processors and the focus for
today I think is going to be not on the
build process itself I just recently did
a how to build video so check that out
if you want the actual step-by-step
procedures but I want to focus on the
flexibility of this build as I go
through stuff because there are parts
you could swap in or out for more or
less money and more or less performance
so there's a lot of things that could be
changed I'm going to start by going over
the parts that I chose at the beginning
of this month on my monthly builds video
and I'll focus on sort of the options
that you have in each category the inner
max liquitex er for - all in one liquid
CPU cooler has a massive contact plate
made just for thread Ripper and is rated
for 500 watts of heat dissipation high
pressure pwm fans mount two rubber
channels on the radiator to absorb the
vibration and the sexy logo and edge
lighting on the block is addressable for
syncing with your motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more so based on the
feedback I got last months the first
choice for this build was the case and
that is because everyone wanted to see a
mini ITX build I chose the Rio Toro CR
280 because it costs around 55 or 60
dollars it's mini ITX and it is small
there's a lot of mini ITX cases that are
on the larger size
there's also thin mini-itx cases that
are a little bit more limited on
expansion capabilities this one is small
still has the same layout that most
standard ATX cases has and it fits full
sized ATX power supplies which means we
have a little bit more flexibility in
our choice there power supply I'm using
today is the EVGA 650 gq-- it's not the
exact one I chose in the builds video
but the primary requirements were 550 to
650 Watts 80 plus bronze or gold rated
and then I also chose one that was
partially modular and has all black
cables so we won't have any nasty
ketchup and mustard cables going on
messing with our color scheme other than
the mini ITX form factor i knew i wanted
to go with the Rison with this build not
simply because i feel like you get the
most bang for your buck when you're
actually buying rise in main stream
processors right now I'm going with the
Rison 2700 X today which is the fastest
second gen rising processor but my
recommendation was just to find the
cheapest 8 Corizon that you could if
you're going for a higher-end build like
this one just gonna cost you around
$1,200 total for all the parts there's
also a lot of newbie 450 motherboards
that have just launched and this is the
slightly more budget option when it
comes to rising processors you can still
overclock so nope
there and I was recommending AV 450 Mini
ITX motherboard in the 110 220 dollar
range this is a brand new board from
gigabyte the B 450 I horas pro Wi-Fi I
think I'm one of the first to be able to
build in it it has an MDOT two expansion
slot for high speed SSDs it has the B
450 chipset which means it's
overclockable it's also got 802 that 11
AC Wi-Fi and USB 3.1 gen2 what memory
kits use is often one of the biggest
question with the rise in built because
they can be finicky about running memory
at faster speeds but you do want faster
speed memory in order to get all of the
performance out of Rison so this is the
Corsair Vengeance lpx kit I've used for
quite a few builds it's ddr4 3000 speed
it's also low profile and no flashy
blingy RGB LEDs or anything like that
it's just solid memory that gets the job
done and if you get this kit it will be
compatible with the XMP setting with
Rison so it's pretty easy to set up and
get your rated speeds for storage I
recommended a 480 to 512 gigabyte class
SSD and I definitely recommend an SSD
for your main operating system this is a
Toshiba OC ZTR 200 which is available
for about 90 to 95 dollars right now but
there are definitely other 500 gig Class
SSDs done in that range to double check
and find one has a good price because
there they go on sale a lot and prices
have been dropping last component here
is a graphics card and I recommend a
geforce gtx 1070 or 1070 TI or 1080
right now and this is very much
depending on the prices because the
prices again are in flux if you're
spending $400 or more on your graphics
card you can definitely get a gtx 1070
but for a 435 or so you can get a gtx
1070 TI which will be faster and for 450
or so you might be able to get a gtx
1080 and those prices maybe even have
gotten a little bit better but any one
of these cards you go with will be fast
just find the one that maybe is on sale
right now or of course the one that will
match your color scheme this one is
black and red and since there are some
black and red accents on the case i
think it will fit in just perfectly
this is my first rio toro case actually
I've heard of them but I have not
actually worked with one of their cases
before for about $60 on first glance
looking again like I just I like the
site elected it's small there's two
thumb screws on the back that I've
already removed which is why the side
panels are falling off there's a little
T embossed on the side I don't know what
the T is for is that the T in Rio Tora
yeah but it does have a small plexi
window on the side there is some plastic
on it to keep it protected I'm gonna
leave that on until I finish the build
also the T stamped on that side but it
does give you a little bit of a look at
the internals and we got a couple
horizontally oriented drive cages there
it looks like 3.5 inch for both of those
gonna have to do some more figuring out
to figure out how these drive trees
actually work they're held on from the
bottom with some thumb screws but if
you're looking down here you might
notice there is a bit of a dust filter
not a fancy one but this is a relatively
inexpensive case there's also a dust
filter across the front there's a dust
filter across the top area behind the
motherboard tray here has a reasonable
amount of space for some cable
management's tucking it away down here
there's a little bit less space in the
top than in the bottom there's also a
couple 2.5 inch drive mounts back here
as well also tucked right down in here
is another 3.5 inch drive mount it's
just got a release here on the top that
would hold it from the sides so actually
three 3.5 inch drive mounts and two 2.5
inch drive mounts in this case and the
front panel is actually all-metal as
well which is kind of nice actually not
just a plastic facade and it's got these
little catches that hold it in place
there's a real Toro logo with just a
piece of red backing on it and I guess a
red accents here just kind of this
little piece of tape that goes around
the edge it's enough to give it a
highlight but that doesn't look gaudy or
anything like that
oh these fronts dust filters do appear
to be removable to front dust filters
individually removable so that's it's
not bad they're not the easiest to get
back into place but I'd rather have them
there than not front panel IO here you
got a couple USB 3.0 ports as well as
mic headphone jacks power and reset
buttons and then I appreciate the fact
that 220 millimeter fans are included
and then just comparing this to some
other like lower end budget cases that
I've worked with you know it's not like
super thick steel or anything but it
doesn't seem like it's too
flimsy and then I do like the fact that
there's some little details like for
instance the rear fan here does have
some rubber gaskets in there that it's
mounted to just to prevent some
vibration from affecting the case I will
say that your expansion slots down here
one of these is a breakaway that one
this one's a breakaway so that's one
time use this is trash now and then this
one is replaceable that's that's a
little weird to me but wonder how much
money they saved by doing that I tweeted
a picture of this little motherboard
yesterday and I got a lot of positive
feedback on it I like what gigabyte has
done with the design there's silver
accents on the heatsinks this also feels
like a pretty substantial heatsink right
there I'm not going to speak to the
power delivery or anything right now but
I do want to point out that they fixed
the location of the eight plans
supplemental CPU power it used to be
like over here on there be 350 board in
this range and that was kind of annoying
to get to you got a couple fan headers a
CPU fan over there and then another fan
header down here for case fans and then
they also have both digital LED output
right there so that's your 5 volt 3 pin
LED and then there's also a 4 pin 12
volt standard LED output there as well
since I chose to use a 2700 X I'm going
to be installing the Wraiths prism
cooler which is the highest end stock
AMD cooler for Rison this actual install
straight to the plastic brackets that
are pre-installed on the socket if you
get a lower end CPU you might have the
standard rates fire cooler like this
though still a very adequate cooler just
doesn't have the fancy RGB and stuff
this one
mounts directly through to the backplate
so you may have seen me mounts these
coolers before which involves removing
these two plastic brackets this one just
has a little clips on either side that
clip around it and that's not exactly
how you do it but you'll see in a second
there's constant debate about applying
thermal paste in CPU cooling situations
I most often go with a method of just
putting a little blob in the middle a
little little smaller than the size of a
pea this time I opted to spread the
thermal paste around though and that is
because there are actual direct heat
pipes on the bottom of this thing and
they have grooves in between them with
direct heat pipe contact if it's not a
uniform flat plate in the middle
sometimes the thermal paste can slip
into the grooves and go side to side
instead of this way and basically you
won't get the maximum amount of contact
between the heat pipes and the thermal
paste and the heat spreader on the CPU
that you want so I remove this drive
cage it's got four thumb screws on the
bottom that hold it in place
to the case and I was trying to figure
out because there's some other like
little tabs on here that mount in
different places and will catches and
these little standout things I think
that's just so you can actually fit
those together like that which kind of
makes sense and then you could secure it
with screws if you wanted I feeling like
maybe Rio Toro uses this cage and maybe
other cases as well I was trying to
forget if they have locations in there
to move it to other locations or
something but there is no manual that
ships with the case there's just a
little card with the QR code on it that
takes you to the Rio tour website which
I found to be not the best experience
trying to figure how these work but I
don't have a 3.5 inch drive anyway so
here are these little drive trays that
come with it just so you guys can get a
look and I'm going to not use this
just looking at our 2.5 inch drive mount
here they give you these little spacer
screws and these are the mounting points
these are little rubberized inserts here
so I do appreciate that again although
you have the issue here where you have
to mount the drive through the actual
backplane and there's nothing to remove
as far as a tray goes so this probably
something you want to plan out earlier
in the build process but it does seem
like you also have the ability if you
wanted to there's just enough space to
fit the drive on that way so if you had
a drive it was blinking here and you
know lit up or something like that it
does seem like you can mount it here and
have it be more visible so that's kind
of nice
things are coming together here if you
saw when I went over the motherboard
there are two fan headers and we have
three fans we need to plug in the CPU
heatsink fan and then the two fans from
the case so if you are thinking about
putting this build together I'd
recommend getting a little fan splitter
just as a simple pwm guy this will allow
me to plug a single plug into the
motherboard fan header which is right
down here and then I can take both of my
two fan headers and wrap them down to
that area and plug them both into that
same header
alright guys so after building
extensively in the Corsair 1000d with my
Riptide builds I am been very happy to
build a nice small computer that I can
pick up and move around without too much
difficulty has also made it easier in
the building process as you can see I
was able to get all the cables tucked
back here pretty nicely there's plenty
of tie down points Bekir which I
definitely appreciated single foreign
aid a SSD currently installed there but
again expandability options here we get
out of second SATA a 2.5 inch SSD we can
add a 3.5 inch drive down here in the
bottom we could add two more 3.5 inch
drives up here via those cages but I
will point out that if you do want to
max out this case with drives you
probably want to opt for a smaller power
supply this one's a little bit long so
it would conflict with those drive cages
consider a power supply that's maybe 140
to 160 millimeters in length this one is
a little bit longer I also want to point
out that the graphics card here just
barely fit I was able to kind of get it
in there at an angle but it's long
enough that it's conflicting with the
front second hundred and twenty
millimeter intake so I would not be able
to add another fan there if I wanted to
unless it was a slim one so if you're
looking at graphics cards maybe up for
ones that are a little bit smaller if
this card was three slot or any bigger
like some of these Asus cards and it
would definitely conflict with the power
supply at the bottom as well so even
though this is a very small build
everything fit in there quite nicely but
there were some parts where I was like
wow this barely fits like the space up
here for CPU coolers if this was much
wider or fatter it would probably
conflict with this rear hardened 20
millimeter fan all this is to say if
you're not using these exact parts that
I'm using today double-check some of the
sizes that you're going to be using just
to make sure that everything will
actually fit in the system if you're
putting together in this case but now
ladies and gentlemen I have plugged in
the system slipped the power switch on
and let's have a quick moment of truth
it works well like really quiet too like
right out of the gate like I can I can
barely hear anything all the fans are
spinning so now is the point in time
where traditional builders if they have
put everything together done the initial
boots to make sure everything is working
can do a quick little peel from our
plexi and replace our side panels so
there you have it guys my tiny little
build in the Rio Toro CR 280 about
$1,200 gets you an 8 core CPU
a gtx 1070 with eight gigs of video
memory overall a really fast system with
an SSD for a boot drive as well as a ton
of expandability for adding more drives
more SSDs in the future and yes you
could easily use this system to game to
game and stream at the same time to edit
video as well as a ton of other stuff
too but guys thank you so much for
watching this video if you enjoyed it
definitely hit the thumbs up button I'll
put links to all the parts I used down
in this video's description and we'll
see you guys next time
have a good one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
