mailbox two days ago and yesterday I did
not have time to do anything with it so
today is the one day that I have to give
you guys some form of preliminary look
at the performance specifications and
otherwise what to think about this new
processor that intel is launching today
which is the 99 80 X e99 80 Extreme
Edition 18 cores 36 threads and this is
basically the successor the replacement
to the 79 80 XE Intel's previous
generation $2000 18 core 36 thread
processor what's the difference with
this one I'm not sure yet I am literally
finding out this information as I read
it so I'm gonna be sort of going along
with that with you guys and learning as
I go so I'll be sharing that with you
and of course we have a quick unboxing
to do right now but more to the point if
you decided already for some reason that
you want to spend $2,000 on this
processor what do you need to go along
with it besides the processor itself of
course you will need a cooling solution
these CPUs do not ship with that so
you're probably gonna want to look into
high-end air cooling or potentially
water cooling and then you're going to
need an X $2.99 motherboard fortunately
Intel has maintained backwards
compatibility with X to 99 boards with
these new processors so all you should
need is an existing X 299 motherboard
like the rampage 6 extreme here there is
a new series of X 299 motherboards that
are coming out from a variety of
motherboard manufacturers you about Asus
and so on Asus is already sending me the
X 299 deluxe - although it didn't arrive
in time for this video but I do have the
rampage 6 extreme setup in the extreme
edition test bed that I did my test
betting competitions with gamers Nexus
and JC since a month and a half or two
months ago so my plan today is to slot
this into that test bed fire it up and
see what it's got going on the 99 80 XE
the master liquid ml 360 our RGB is a
new all-in-one by Cooler Master that
sports a 360 mm meter radiator
addressable RGB fans and a low-profile
dual chamber pump the nicely sleeved FTP
tubing has a premium feel and you can
use the included RGB control unit to
customize the addressable LEDs on the
fans and pump or plug directly into your
motherboard for more on the master
liquid ml 360 our RGB click the sponsor
link in the video's description before I
get this installed for testing though I
do want to run down some of these
and information that intel has sent over
again this is all really early because I
haven't had time to process this very
much but this is the actual letter that
Intel is sending out to its various
press partners who they have sent
samples to and here I wanted to point
out because people ask me this a lot
when I'm provided a sample by somebody
like Intel they've actually put this
block of text in here specifically
saying by providing the sample until a
no way requests or expects you to say or
do anything on behalf of Intel now I'm
only pointing this out because I get
samples sent to be pretty often which
I'm very thankful for but I also get
accused pretty often it's like oh they
sent you this sample to $2,000 processor
this obviously must bias you in one way
or another I do my very best not to be
biased and to give you guys unbiased and
neutral objective reviews products like
this and hey if we want to compare this
to what am decent recently I mean this
is AMD's impressive packaging for the
threader per sample that they sent over
and I mean come on how is that look I
got a brown honestly the packaging that
these arrive in matters not at all so
let's get rid of this and let's talk
about some actual features of the
processors so this is directly from
Intel please bear in mind but it's got
Intel turbo boost technology 2.0 I also
got turbo boost max technology 3.0 and
that will allow you to take a single
core or dual core performance up to four
point five gigahertz on a single or two
threads at a time on these processors
now very mom when Intel actually made
this announcement back at the beginning
of October and they also announced the
9900 X at the same time they actually
had a full lineup of 9000 series
high-end desktop processors the 9800 X
98 20x and so forth the 4.5 gigahertz
applies to all the CPUs except for the
98 20x which actually has a turbo boost
max of 4.2 gigahertz just wanted to
point that out but I will post a link to
the Intel newsroom brief on this if you
guys want to check it out and look at
the full details but we can see that the
TDP is still listed 165 watts for all
processors in this family and then we
have the 99 ad XC at the top with 18
cores and thirty-six threads then we got
a 16 core 14 core 12 core 10 core 10
core and 8 core version of those
available in this whole lineup right
here there's 4544 PCI Express Lanes
available on the 99 80 X II and then
there are 24 more available via the PCH
or the peripheral controller hub and
why they're saying effectively up to 68
platform PCIe lanes but bear in mind if
you're talking about direct connectivity
for high speed stuff like MDOT two
drives or graphics cards forty four
lanes is what you're working with their
last thing to mention is price pricing
for a thousand of these is at one
thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
dollars that's bulk pricing so you're
probably gonna be paying two thousand
bucks for this at retail just like you
maybe would have paid for the 79 80 XE
if you have money falling out of your
button okay guys just some initial setup
going on here I had to double check my
existing test bed first off to make sure
everything's still functional and it
appears to be also had to double check
and make sure that we have an updated
BIOS for the motherboard to be
compatible with the new processor and I
was actually a little worried because I
hadn't received any updates but Asus let
me know that version 1503 which actually
came out two months ago over two months
ago was the update to support these
processors so they have been around for
a while and the motherboard itself is
okay and ready to go when it comes to
slotting in the new CPU now here's the
3d mark time spike stream Hall of Fame
the two way scores that we were
attempting to have a bit of an OC
challenge last months with their barish
still on top with his max score here
Jay and Steve scores are still holding
up quite well - they're still in third
and fifth I meanwhile have been
supplanted by lots of people with scores
in the 14 thousands and I'm down here at
position number 18 VPS customs Brian
also surpassed me with his additional
overclocking attempt with air
conditioning but I am going to try to
keep things a little bit more simpler
here today and just to give us a point
of comparison my max score with to a 28
ET is in sli was thirteen thousand eight
hundred and sixty one and more
specifically the cpu score was 11
thousand 97 so my simple goal for today
is going to be to slot in the CPU
runtimes by extreme and see at stock how
close the 99 80 XE can get to the 79 80
XE my 79 80 XE of course being deleted
it does not have liquid metal but it
does have upgraded thermal paste and
then of course we're going to be using
the same cooling solution with the ek
x2 99 monoblock that they have for the
rampage 6 extreme let's see what the
results are we have initial success with
our initial first boot with the updated
configuration here so as you guys
probably just saw it was a little bit of
a challenge to swap in the new CPU since
I am using a monoblock it had to remove
the entire motherboard to get back
behind it because there's a backplate
that well not a backplate but that it
screws in from the back fortunately with
Joe's help so that wasn't too terribly
difficult and then of course we got the
second Asus GeForce r-tx 2080 ti the ROG
Strix Edition of that which I have been
excited actually arrived about a week or
so ago to just install and see what two
of these together can do because I do
potentially have some chances to do some
overclocking with those in the future
I'm probably not gonna get to that today
but for now I've reset everything to
BIOS defaults so I'm going to restart
this in normal mode just default out of
the box settings and we'll do some
initial tests to see how it's performing
this will give me just a minute I need
to restart and update the drivers
actually one thing I am going to change
in here just letting you guys know how
things are being set up and this is by
asus is request because this is again a
pretty early BIOS for this new processor
they said they were pretty conservative
with the settings until they did get
some new CPUs in and do some direct
testing themselves so the recommendation
is if I use XMP which I do want to turn
on because we'd have some pretty nice
memory here we are going to also use MCE
or multi core enhancement this is
something that is optional it will run
the CPU a bit out of spec so it is gonna
run the CPU a little bit harder than you
normally would but I just want to be
fully clear with everyone that I am
leaving that on and then the
recommendation I got from Asus for this
setting is if I'm gonna use XMP and MCE
to enable s fit support as well so those
are the three changes that I'm making
and we'll go
okay Oh also since I am using XMP ddr4
speed is set to 38 68 because this is a
very nice ddr4 32 gig kits from g.skill
that they sent over for that
overclocking battle and it's still
installed so I'm not gonna remove it I
guess just to show you what we're
working with here I have updated the
Nvidia drivers we're in version 4 16.8 1
and we have both of our our TX 20 ATT is
currently functioning in SLI mode right
there maximized 3d performance I'm going
to leave everything else at defaults
I've downloaded some monitoring software
this is the updated versions but I'm
getting some weird readouts here like
for instance CPU Z thinks I have a 79 80
X II on the processor name but spec here
is listing properly as a 99 8 Exe
hardware info for some reason that
thinks I've got a xeon 3000 this is the
latest beta version 5.8 9-30 520i 264
just updated though and if we look at
itis 64 cpuid we can see the 99 80 XE
listed right there as well as the rest
of the specs for the hardware I have
installed we can also see here that the
XMP setting has taken effects with our
dear M frequency it's effectively about
38 69 by my math with casa latency 18 19
1939 so our first test here is just
going to be the I 264 system stability
test which I have just kicked off my
plan is to let this run for about 10
minutes or so and this is going to give
us a few readings one it's gonna give us
a temperature reading for the CPU under
a full constant load over a period of
time we'll also be able to look here at
the frequencies to see what kind of max
frequency we're getting across multiple
cores and then of course whatever that
temperature creeps up to right now it's
not too bad at all per quart we're only
hitting in the mid 40s or high forties
here so again we do have a custom
liquid-cooled set up with a mono block
so we should be getting good cooling
with this CPU but let's give it a few
minutes and see if things warm up well
this isn't a good sign we have a
hardware failure detected test stopped
notification here it didn't seem to
throttle at all I'm not seeing any
reports of throttling or overheating
when it comes to our hardware info 64
results here it looks like the hottest
we got to was 57 degrees Celsius on the
CPU packet package the hottest any
individual core got was
fifty-two degrees Celsius so it's hard
to say exactly what caused this I'm
gonna hit clear here and see if I can
restart give it another shot all right
well here once again we have another
hardware failure detected by i-264 I am
a little bit baffled as to why this is
happening because I'm not doing anything
special with the CPU in fact if we look
at hardware info over here we can see
that we've only hit just over 4.5
gigahertz as we would expect the fastest
we've seen as far as a frequency on a
single core is about 4.5 eight gigahertz
here on core number nine and when it was
running with all cores engaged it was
only running at about 2.5 to 2.8
gigahertz which is pretty low that's
what it's supposed to do when it's
running across all 18 cores and 36
threads under a stress test environment
like I just put it under but I'm sort of
at a loss as to what else might be going
wrong here with this last test I
unchecked the memory stress test and I
was hoping to indicate there that like
maybe it's just that memory XMP
overclocked value that I put in there
this is a pretty high speed memory and
you're not guaranteed that you're gonna
be able to run your memory at that speed
with any given processor beyond that
though I'm nowhere near close to thermal
throttle limits 54 degrees Celsius was
the hottest any single core gots the CPU
package temperature got up to 59 even
looking here at my CPU package power 171
watts is the maximum draw that's only
six watts more than the rated TDP of
this CPU which is a hundred and
sixty-five watts so I don't think I'm
running out of spec what what to do next
though I think I'm gonna stop trying to
run really fast memory okay so I reset I
have installed a G scale flare x-kid of
memory now which is universally
compatible it's actually made for Rison
but it has Samsung B die actually ICS on
there so it's a very compatible kit also
running 3200 speed castle I can see 14
which is a nice I think balanced speeds
it's a faster kit but it's not crazy
fast like that 3,800 speed kit that I
had originally tried to install now just
to be clear I'm not at all trying to say
that like this kit or this faster memory
kit isn't gonna work with the CPU
there's a ton of other stuff I could
probably go in there to go in tweak
settings and try to get it to work
because 38 66 is an overclock speed when
it comes to the
memory that's compatible with this
platform but I'm more focused on getting
the CPU up and running so I can run at
least a few tests for you guys and again
I'm really short on time so the i-264
test has now been running for just over
seven minutes and here we can see CPU
speeds frequency 2.8 gigahertz is what
it's going to run out at across all
cores and then you might have one or two
cores pop up to three point three
gigahertz again this is all default
out-of-the-box speeds that you get only
only thing we've done is plugged in the
XMP value for the memory and then we can
see maximum we're hitting 4.5 gigahertz
which is what we're told is the maximum
turbo boost speed so that lines up as
well when it comes to temperatures /
core temperature the hottest we saw is
53 degrees Celsius on a single core so
that's not bad at all again we're
running with a custom liquid cooler and
everything so we would expect pretty
good temperatures here package power it
didn't even hit the hundred and 65 watt
max here but CPU package temp max set at
58 degrees Celsius so perfectly adequate
temperatures I imagine those would ramp
up pretty quickly if we delve into some
overclocking with this because that's
what happens with these 79 80 XE but
we're probably not going to get quite
that far today one other thing I wanted
to point out is that my previous version
of hardware info 64 actually didn't
update for some reason so we've got the
updated newest beta version and now we
have properly listed the I 999 ATX II
there so let's jump over to some more
tests I'm just I'm gonna run this in a
bitch I just wanna runs in a bitch
alright guys we have some results for
Cinebench at least we're using the
multi-threaded test with all 18 cores
and 36 threads active score was 37 56 if
you want to compare that to the 79 80 XE
that stock $33.99 so about 3400 score
jumped about 350 points not too bad
there when it comes to single core
performance 279 ATX e will do about 192
points in Cinebench single core mode we
jumped up five points 297 so not a bad
increase there as well of course that
still is a pretty decent step behind the
9900 K which has the fastest single core
performance right now and that one will
score about 220 points in this test next
test of course is times by extreme 3d
mark direct x12 test this test is just
finishing up again just running this
once due to lack of time and there's our
results of twelve thousand and ninety
this is of course significantly below
the score is the
I was doing when I was doing the
overclock testing because we are not too
overclocked but we can at least still
get a representation of the CPU score
here which was eight thousand six
hundred and sixty eight and that is
pretty far behind the overclocked 79 80
XE scores I was getting cuz I was
running a 79 80 XE at just about 5
gigahertz across all course in the final
bit of testing that I did they so here
are the results from that max test that
I ran before since it was on this same
system went to 79 80 XE score of 13 8 61
and here my cpu score was
it's kind of small here but 11,000 97 so
that's what I was getting overclocked
the same number of cores and threads in
the same architecture in the same
manufacturing process just running at a
much higher frequency and as you or may
be able to see as I was running through
the previous tests when you're talking
about running across all cores at
default with the CPU you're gonna be
running about 2.8 acres which is not
that fast when it comes to overall
frequency but it does keep the
temperatures down so of course ramping
that up with some overclocking is gonna
increase the temperatures we are seeing
single core speeds though of maximum of
4 point 5 gigahertz I thought it was
interesting that as we were running
Cinebench that was actually bouncing
around a little bit more than I would
have expected I would have expected to
see one core always pegged at 4.5
gigahertz but we were seeing four point
two and then four point three and then
four point four so turbo tables or
something that Intel has been played
very close to their chest they're not
very open about what causes the CPU to
ramp up to certain frequency at a
specific time
so one last test that I ran here guys
and that is x by non Extreme Edition
because I'm pretty much out of time but
I did run time spy so that's associated
somehow but point being I have 220 ATT
eyes and SLI going on right now so the
graphics core is pretty impressive it's
1t 4555 I can't compare that to my
initial test with the 79 ATX a though
because I was only running one 1080 Ti
but the CPU score is a valid comparison
we got eleven thousand eight hundred and
eighty six compare that to the physics
score in this same test with the 79 80
XE which was eleven thousand and seventy
and we can see we have about an 800
point jump which is a nice indication of
the benefits you get from the 99 eight
exe running at a higher frequency out of
the box than the 79 80 XE now my big
question about this is going to be
realistically speaking how much of an
upgrade is the
from the 79ad EXCI it's the same price
it looks like because we're also working
with the same microarchitecture the same
process technology 14 nanometer at the
same frequencies I would expect these
two CPUs to run at exactly the same
speeds and get the pretty much the exact
same test results it is a question to be
asked how much further the 99 80 XC
might be able to overclock compared to
the 79 80 XC unfortunately I haven't had
time to delve into that today but
perhaps something to look at in the
future so guys if you have any ideas for
stuff that I should do further testing
with with this testbed and the
ridiculous amount of hardware that's
installed please leave those suggestions
down in the comment section down below
and I'll read them and perhaps I will do
that in the future also there are
probably other people who have 99 80
exes who are releasing reviews on them
right now so I'm gonna check those out
get some people with some more thorough
benchmarking material on pulse links to
those in the description too so check
those out if you have a chance while
you're down there don't forget to hit
the thumbs up button and of course
subscribe for more videos coming at you
very soon from pulse hardware thank you
guys so much again for watching this one
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
