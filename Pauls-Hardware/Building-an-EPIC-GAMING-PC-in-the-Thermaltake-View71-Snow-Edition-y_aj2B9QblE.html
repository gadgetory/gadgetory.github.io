the video description what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware I have an
epic system build for you guys today so
I'm going to be putting together all the
parts that you see here in front of me
this is a white themed build mostly
white I should say a little bit of RGB
mixed in there too but it was all
conceptualized and based around this
case which actually arrived a month or
two ago but it's the thermal take view
71 TG snow this is actually already
launched in the black version it is
pretty much all white except for some
tinted tempered glass windows and I need
a name for this built so maybe something
snow related or something white related
I don't know let me know in the comments
if you guys have any epic names for this
build I was thinking of like snow
blinders Snow Crash or snow demon or
maybe like it's no big deal could always
just go with snow white that you might
have Disney lawyers attacking me anyway
comments in the comment section let's
start off by going over the rest of the
parts for this build so I actually want
to start out with my choice for the
graphics card which is the MSI titanium
geforce gtx 1070 TI which i chose
because it has white LEDs and also a
nice black and silver aesthetic
particular match really nicely with this
case as well as the overall remainder of
the parts for the build I do want to
point out that this cost $500 retail
right now and if I was actually building
a system with the focus on performance I
probably ditched some of the more
expensive like RGB parts like the case
for example is a at least the black
version cost 170 retail it's currently
selling for about 150 bucks on Amazon
I've also got like you know a higher-end
360 millimeter radiator liquid cooler
I would probably ditch some of the
sirens stuff to upgrade the graphics
card to a GTX 1080 or a 1080 Ti before I
invested in all that other stuff that
said this is a build for my youtube
channel and it's got to look pretty so
that's the main reason I chose this but
to consider a higher end GPU if you're
actually considering putting the system
together I don't have a ton of RGB in
this build but the team t4s delta memory
kit here in white is going to be
providing a decent amount of that
this is the Delta RGB version and I got
two kits here 8 gigs per stick so a
total of 32 gigs
this is ddr4 3000 speed memory and I've
already used the black version of this
in the build I did last month so it
looks really nice especially when
everything is set up and I'm gonna once
again be pairing that with the team tee
force Delta RGB SSDs I got 2 of them
this time and these are the white
versions now instead of the black
version so hopefully going to find a
nice visible place to put those
side-by-side cuz cuz these look pretty
cool and adds a decent amount of bling
to your storage setup actually had a
difficult time finding an all-white
motherboard and for example there is a B
360 motherboard from MSI that's all
white with a white PCB and everything
but this is a higher-end build and I
just didn't feel right going with a B
360 chipset so with asus prime z 370 - a
cuz it's got white accents on there it's
also a very solid all-around motherboard
very good reviews and feedback whether
you're looking at new egg or amazon and
it only costs about a hundred and sixty
dollars since this is a high-end build
on intel's mainstream platform that
being LGA 1151 for the socket z 370 for
the chipset but the new version of LGA
1151 I of course had to go with the i7
8700 K I guess I could have gone with
the new 8086 but I don't have one of
those and I already had this one
it's my engineering sample direct from
Intel so 6 cores 12 threads and a great
choice especially for a gaming PC to
keep the 8700 K cool we have the H 150 I
Pro RGB from Corsair newest 360
millimetre radiator all in one liquid
cooler with the new ACE tech hump block
combo units - also got some RGB on that
I do also have the thermal tape 360 rad
version but I thought with the black
white silver theme actually the block on
this one I think will look a little bit
nicer and finally for power the old
standby the EVGA 750 g3 80 plus gold
rated PSU and once again using the
sleeve to cable kit that EVGA uh sells
separately that you can buy for the 750
g3 they sell these for a lot of their
power supply kits but I think this will
look a lot nicer than using the standard
cables it's also been somewhat pre-wired
from the build I did last month and I'm
kind of lamenting that I don't have like
a house set of all white cables because
I think that would actually look really
nice in this build but for the time
being this will work
so here's a first look at the unboxed
views of anyone TG snow as you can see
pretty much all whites some black
accents like on the drive trays the bit
of mesh to some mesh behind this front
tempered glass piece as well as the fan
and the grommets but it also looks
somewhat silver and I think that's just
because they have grey glass for the
tempered glass panels sits on the front
both sides left and right side as well
as the top here's an interesting thing
they've done for the front IO they've
little plugs in them
plugs on the front IO but IO is pretty
standard two USB 3.0 a couple USB 2.0
mic and headphone jack but of course
love to see a USB type-c up here but
can't get everything all the time there
is a reset button right here though and
then the power button is actually
touched in there over here side panels
are held in place at the top front here
and the bottom front here by some pretty
hefty thumb screws there's a rubberized
spot right behind them and then they
swing out like so on hinges at the back
and of course you can look them off if
you need to I should also mention that
I'm always on the fence about what to do
about the peely stuff here I know you
guys love the peeling of this off of all
of the tempered glass pieces but then
whenever I do it there's a bunch of
people who say no you should leave it on
until the builds finished which is a
more practical way of doing it so here's
here's one at least I'm gonna peel that
off yeah it's gorgeous
alright I had to get my fix
after you move all these thumb screws
the big ones are for the side panels the
smaller ones are for the front and top
panels you can actually remove those
tempered glass pieces so that's not too
difficult it's also good that they have
provided a decent amount of spacing here
so that there's actually a decent amount
of gap between the front and the top
panel and where air would need to either
be exhausted or in taked in taked sure
that's a word and as reviews of the
original view 71 have proven the airflow
on this case is actually pretty decent
now the front piece and the top piece
are removed by the old-school grab and
yank method so just grab to the back and
pull and you can lift that top piece off
I initially thought this dust filter
underneath was a little bit janky but I
did find out it's magnetized and it's
flexible and it's got these little tabs
along there as well so if you tuck the
magnetized parts up underneath the tabs
you can get it to rest in there with the
fair amount of stability and sturdiness
so I wouldn't call it the most
user-friendly dust filter but I'd much
rather that it is there than not there
you got a similar situation on the front
panel here and they have actually added
metal strips to the plastic frame so
that the magnets on the dust filter will
attach and get you a reasonable
situation to work with here when it
comes to dust filtration beyond that for
radiator support you're pretty well set
up with the view 71 you can do 360 or
420 millimeter radiators at the top and
this bracket is removable with the four
thumb screws two at the back in two at
the front and you get the same radiator
support for the Front's intake here
although that bracket is not removable
behind that you have some drive cages
here they've included two of them with
for actual 3.5 inch drive trays these
are pretty standard somewhat flexible
plastic mounts that you can pull out to
slot your 3.5 inch or 2.5 inch drive
into and then replace like so behind now
the main motherboard tray has some black
rubber grommets for routing your cables
through in this case does have support
for the somewhat ubiquitous now vertical
GPU mount with a two slit a CH Montera
the back and they've even included a
bracket to help prevent sag on that GPU
what they have not included though in
the accessories which are right here is
an actual PCI Express extension so that
will be sold separately if you need it
Thermaltake does sell those including
very long
so that's an option but since I don't
have that I'm going to be removing that
bracket and just going with the standard
GPU mount down here at the bottom you
got another intake you could possibly
mount a couple hundred and twenty
millimeter fans for and then there's a
full-length dust filter that you can
pull out from the back that will provide
that filtration not just for the power
supply but also for that intake at the
bottom and then around here on the back
of the case we can see there is plenty
of space back here for cable management
so I approve of that there's a couple
removable trays actually one here and
then a couple over here these actually
have 2.5 inch mounts on there so you can
add a bunch of 2.5 inch drives one two
three four five and six on top of
whatever you might be able to fit in the
cages up front these panels actually are
removable and that will provide you
access to the back of this rail system
and if you do want to remove those drive
cages which are held on by Phillips head
screws you can do that and then there's
some various mounting points here for
pumps radiators or reservoirs I believe
these panels provide a secondary
function of giving you a little bit of a
way to hide your cables since this does
have tempered glass on both sides by
putting that there and then feeding all
of your cables up to maybe one of these
pass throughs you could potentially hide
some of that so my first impressions
would be seems like a pretty solid
layout for the case I'm not the hugest
fan of the dust filtration here but I am
appreciative that it is there at least
and that you can remove these internal
magnetic filters from the panel's
themselves but if you are going to do
your zest dust filters like this
I suppose it is good that these entire
panels are pretty easy to remove and
they don't conflict with the front IO so
you can pop those off to clean them
without necessarily messing with
anything else when it comes to wiring in
your case one final critique I have is
the printing here actually up on the
front I oh it's just a little sloppy
it's not as clean as I feel like it
should be so then we'll take that's
maybe somewhere you could approve
improve on in the future
first I couldn't figure out what these
little rubberized pieces were in the
accessory kit then I realized uh they're
actually the stand off feet for the
power supply I'm not sure if this is how
it's going to ship or if it's just
because I got a pretty early sample of
this but remember to install these
before you install your power supply
the build is coming along I've decided
to go with pretty much all white LED
fans here so it ships the case ships
with 240 millimeter White's LED
thermaltake fans I tried to kind of
space them out a little bit first that X
while still providing plenty of front
air intake for the rest of the fans in
the case I've gone with these of course
era maglev fans and these have white
LEDs in them I've actually had these
around for a while and I just realized I
had enough of them to do this job so I
replace the fans that shipped with the H
150 I Pro with these maglev fans and
they have a central white LED hub so I
think that'll look pretty cool add one
back here for exhaust as well to provide
some more uniformity in the case and
then a couple more changes for one Jo
notice that the SSD mount tray here that
we had mounted these two behind the
motherboard tray is the same exact
configuration as the two that are back
here now it doesn't seem like there's a
native front facing as this d-mat if you
have fancy RGB LED SSDs like ours but we
did discover that if you're willing to
provide a little bit of force and just
the tiny bit of flex on the steel frame
you can swap this around to this side
and still get it to mount again it takes
a little bit of pressure to do that but
this will give us the ability to mount
our SSDs on the front here and it will
also provide me an excuse with doing it
not as good of a cable management job in
the back because now I don't need to
show you guys the back side with the
SSDs mounted we didn't flip them a
hundred and eighty degrees so that they
be facing the right direction and the
SATA power and data cables are going to
be on this side unfortunately I don't
have any good pass-through right here
I'm really going to have to bring those
over to this grommets or possibly go
down to here oh and one other thing the
bracket for our radiator mount up here
at the top can actually be shifted
there's holes not just where it's at but
actually to shifted up that way and I
think even though we have plenty of
clearance up here with our single push
configuration I think I'm going to shift
this up a little bit just to move it
away from the motherboard and make
things a little bit more spaced out
all right guys all of the major
components are installed and I spent a
reasonable amount of time doing cable
management on here just to show you guys
really quick with that yeah yeah it's
not bad
okay more to the point though it's time
for our first inaugural test boot so up
further ado things are looking up two of
our maglev love fans I know that's s DS
not like we got T force our jeebies
though and I think probably during the
cable management back here I
disconnected those
oh really thermal take this is a faux
pas right here I don't know I don't know
how I feel about this I kind of got it
it's extra tempered glass sticker here
with ghetto adhesive but does not want
to come off cleanly at least not with
that a perfect slow peel I'm gonna have
to clean up that bit in the corner
so I was able to troubleshoot the
problem with the fans there was just one
fan that was not connected at the top
here I had to plug slightly up there and
then the one that was coming down to the
bottom I actually had two splitters up
at this bottom plug running the front
two fans as well as one of the top fans
from the radiator so I just switched
those splitters around and replug them
in and then everything lit up and it was
looking very pretty except for the SSDs
what I forgot completely as I was
setting up the parts for this build is
that the SSDs use addressable RGB is the
five volts three pin plugs this
motherboard does not have that connector
fortunately I have a few random RGB LED
things hanging around such as little
individual control boxes so I tried a
couple different ones and I ended up
using one of the cooler master ones so
that's plugged in back there via SATA
and that one actually has some controls
on it so I was able to cycle through and
get us an appealing RGB blend on our
front SSDs and that was really necessary
because it wouldn't really do to just
have them off but now they're lit up and
you can get a bit more appreciation of
the RGB speaking of RGB
doing the white LEDs with the case fans
and then having a little bit of RGB in
the system itself I'm still kind of on
the fence about one thing it's
definitely shown to me is that white
LEDs are not always white especially if
it's an RGB LED like the LED on the side
of this graphics card for example is our
GB whereas the fans are just white but
even the all white LEDs in the case like
the White's LEDs on the front
Thermaltake fans and the white LEDs on
the top Maglev fans from Corsair are not
exactly matching up so here's an example
of why you might want to sort of veer
towards a single source for all of your
lighting needs thermaltake for example
has a pretty wide array of RGB fans and
an entire ecosystem was software they've
developed that around that I was just
kind of using stuff that I had on hand
as well as just a few of the parts that
were sent specifically for this build
but all that said I think things are
still looking pretty nice here and I
think that's because the whites sort of
ties everything together whether you're
talking about the black the silver or
the red green and blue colorful LEDs
or the white LEDs so guys I will put the
links to the parts that I've used in
this bill down in the description but
one final warning to you guys if you
didn't catch it at the beginning I do
not recommend building this system as is
without giving some consideration to an
upgrade on the graphics card because
that is a core component that will give
you more performance versus a lot of the
other stuff that's integrated into this
build which is a lot more for aesthetics
and I usually go for performance before
aesthetics so consider a 1080 or a 1080
Ti before you invest in everything else
that's all for this video though guys so
definitely hit the thumbs up button if
you enjoyed it and of course check the
description once again for links to all
the parts I used as well as a link to my
store where you can support me by buying
shirts mugs pint glasses or other useful
stuff thanks again so much for watching
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
