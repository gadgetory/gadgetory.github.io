today I'm gonna be doing a review of
this tablet this is the Asus memo pad HD
7 this is my first ever tablet that I've
actually gone out and bought actually
got this a couple months ago been using
it so I can give you guys a full review
on my thoughts and opinions and actual
some use case scenarios and also when I
got it I immediately wanted to open it
and start using it so that's kind of how
that came about this is a more budget
oriented tablet the MSRP is about $150
to that end I also have gotten a budget
oriented tablet case I've actually been
using this without a case for quite some
time I just said I wanted to get a case
I got this one from the new egg market
place it's a bit cheaper than the
official Asus one so I'll be doing a
quick unbagging or whatever of this this
is the root case origami folio case
cover with stylus for Asus memo pad HD 7
as well as a full review of the Asus
memo pad HD 7 here goes so let's start
off with the why question why did I buy
this product
well basically doing what I do I should
probably have a tablet so I decided to
jump in and get this one I've never
really been all that interested in the
premium tablets the $400 + 400 to $600
plus ones like the iPads or even a $200
plus tablet for that matter I personally
see this as more as an occasional use
device it's not really a PC replacement
for me I'm not going to do the types of
things on this that I do with my desktop
computer so I didn't want to spend a ton
of money but I saw the specs in the
price point for the Asus memo pad HD 7
at Computex this year I saw that it is
basically like a first gen Nexus 7 with
some upgrades to it so that was pretty
compelling for me and 450 bucks I was
like oh well that seems pretty
reasonable
speaking of which doing a quick unboxing
here you can see as far as what comes in
the box this week gets a AC adapter
micro USB power cable for charging and
data transfer as well as the
documentation and warranty information
the route case pretty much comes with
the plastic covering he's dead
and their case itself and that's pretty
much gonna wrap it up for my root case
review this is just a pretty decent
quality a little cover protection cover
and stand and it's way way cheaper than
the Asus one which is I think is like 40
or 45 bucks
but let's move on to the specs for the
hd7
first off the screen which is
undoubtedly one of the best features of
this it's a 7-inch 1280 by 800 IPS
display again pretty much the same one
you're going to get on a first gen Nexus
7 you get 16 gigabytes of integrated
storage and you get a micro USB slot and
that was absent on the first gen Nexus 7
so that's a huge bonus because even with
16 gigs which is pretty decent for a
tablet microUSB slot you can add up to
64 gigs more depending on your
preference powering the device we have a
1.2 gigahertz media tech Mt
for Tech's a7 ARM processor so that's an
immediate tech one if you haven't heard
of them that's because they're a bit
more on the budget line but this
processor has plenty of chops for
handling basic tableting tasks for
graphics you have a 286 mega its power
VR SGX 5-4 for mt1 and GPU and this is a
pretty decent GPU it's not top of the
line by any means I would not compare it
to for instance a Tegra 4 or even a
Tegra 3 for that matter when it comes to
graphics I've only done a bit of light
gaming on this and it's been ok I
wouldn't recommend it for the latest
tablet or android games if they're
pushing the 3d pixels a little bit
harder but for basic gaming and
day-to-day tasks it's perfectly adequate
you get one gigabyte of integrated ddr3
memory and for a wireless connection to
get eight or 2.11 BG and the Wi-Fi only
has a single 2.4 gigahertz antenna which
is I mean not the favorite but again for
simple tasks that I've been using it for
even for streaming video it's been just
fine also Bluetooth and GPS integrated
size-wise at 7.7 inches by 4.7 inches by
0.4 inches and if you're metric user
it's one hundred ninety six point eight
millimeters by 120 point six millimeters
by ten point eight
meters and it weighs ten point seven
ounces Asus is providing the center 480
of colors this is the blue one which has
a matte finish there's also a black
matte finish available although it was
not available on the egg when I bought
this otherwise I probably would have
gone with the black and then it's also
available in white pink and green glossy
finishes which I have heard have a bit
of a cheaper feel to them but I have the
matte one which I like the billow of
this plastic it's not the greatest but
this is more of a budget tablet so it's
kind of what you might expect you get a
micro USB port a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack a micro SD card slot and
then you also have volume and power
buttons I'm not ecstatic about the
placement of these they're a little bit
difficult to reach at times but again
it's passable so not too many problems
with that you get stereo speakers
although you can't really see them it
does have stereo and the Sun is actually
pretty decent as well and then you get a
5 megapixel rear facing camera as well
as a 1.2 megapixel front facing camera
which is also quite cool if you want to
do video chat or that sort of thing
you totally can for software it ships
with Android 4.2.2 and it's just as only
does some minor modifications to the UI
you have an Asus keyboard and an Asus
notification tray and you can fairly
easily go into the settings and turn
those off and switch back to the native
Android keyboard and notification tray
if he wants I haven't found that
necessary to do so far although I might
do it with the keyboard because I'm not
a huge fan of the autocomplete on it
thus far you get an excuse cam app and a
few other apps that integrated the
camera apps actually also pretty decent
as long as you have plenty of light this
takes okay pictures as well although
again that's not really what I bought it
for you also have the ability to do
floating apps and widgets which I
haven't played around with too much but
that's one of the more recent
functionalities built into Android 4.2.2
so if you are wanting to multitask on
your tablet floating apps and widgets
can kind of give you a simpler way to do
that what I have actually used this for
so far here at home this is primarily
web browsing while sitting on the couch
I can do some music and video playback
so if I'm going around doing chores or
cooking some food or something like that
I can sort of set this up and it gives
me a much larger viewable screen than
say my cell phone so it's nice for
watching videos and stuff or just play
music
I have Pandora and
stall so I can run some streaming music
and then also play music directly off of
the SD card or from my network as well
which is cool while I'm at home also
I've used this with my HTPC since I have
a seaton infinite TV card seating it
also has an app it's five bucks but I
did buy it because Steve recommended it
and I'm actually quite enjoyed it you
can use the app to control media center
or Windows Media Center you can use it
to schedule recordings and it's much
easier to do than using just a simple
mouse or even the directional interface
with the remote and then I actually used
it as a replacement remote control to
when my remote went out although it's
working again so so I don't need it
anymore but the seasoned app is also
pretty useful for that I brought it to
work a few times to use it for web
browsing like if I'm doing video
operation or camera operating and I have
some downtime so I can pop up some
webpages or whatever you're in do some
research look up stuff also I found it
very useful to do data entry while I'm
running bit remarks since I have the
Google Drive app installed I can pull up
my shared spreadsheet for example where
I store all of my benchmarks and it
makes a really easy way to do data entry
well not having to use the computer than
benchmarking on so it's usually I'm
disconnected from the internet while I
benchmark and also I've been using for
taking down notes
well like film videos from time to time
or reading off notes while I film videos
so also a pretty useful there so that's
pretty much the specs and that's what
I've been using it for so let's get down
to some opinion here some some review
stuff so I'm gonna kind of separate this
out first I'll talk about the build
build quality and the build quality is
okay again this is a budget tablet
you're not going to find the sort of
rubberized finished or the really sturdy
nice heft in the hand type of build
quality that you would with like a
higher-end
iPad or higher end tablets that are
available from Asus even for that matter
so I give it a 7 for build quality it's
still sturdy enough you might notice
here in the corner for example some of
the finishes actually rubbed off that's
part of why I got the
the carrying case for it but yeah oh
okay build quality just a seven you're
not going to be blown away by it or
anything
performance again is okay I would give
it a seven but I'm gonna bump it up to
an eight because the screen is so nice
again this is not quite the same display
quality is like the new Nexus 7 but
equal or better than the old Nexus 7 so
very nice screen quality it's an IPS
screen which is great to have for a
tablet at this price point and then as
far as a performance otherwise this
versus just web browsing or navigation
the snappiness of it is pretty decent
I will notice some slowdown and some
stutters here and there it's nothing
that I've not encountered with just
about any Android devices that I've
tried to use here and there but you will
notice this doesn't have the
top-of-the-line processor so it's not
going to be quite as buttery smooth but
again for just basically browsing
everything totally fine and nothing that
I would even really complain about if I
wasn't doing a dedicated review battery
life is something I should mention it's
got a 15 watt hour battery and I've
found that it will easily last two to
three or even more days than that with
light or medium use but that's what's
pretty random is only using in an
evening or whatever if you are using it
continuously you can expect about eight
hours
Asus will list up to ten but I found
closer to eight so if you're gonna be
taking this on a plane or something like
that you can watch several movies of it
back-to-back movies or TV shows or what
not so great for long plane rides or
something like that maybe a long car
ride or a car trip if you're gonna be
doing video playback or web browsing
that's the kind of battery life you
should expect for value I would say that
it is fantastic and again that's a
really big reason why I had what put
this laptop do to the price points and
the performance of it so I give it a
nine for value which gives it an overall
score of eight and and I might be
refining my scoring methods here in the
future but that's what we'll finish on
and overall score of eight so again
totally acceptable and adequate and I'd
say quite nice for everything I've
bought it for I'm very happy with my
purchase so far and this has been a
fantastic tablet for me and it's pretty
much done everything I've asked it to do
so if you're interested in a tablet this
holiday season check it out I'll post a
link down in the video description and
if you're looking for something just
kind of a step up from here
the Nexus 7 from Google is a fantastic
one as well I know Kyle has one of those
he did a video of it over on
awesomesauce news so check at least I
think he did
I know he got it if he didn't do a video
on it he's really missing out but
remember the Nexus 7 a fantastic upgrade
option for this Fiona spend maybe 70 80
bucks more but if you enjoyed this video
don't forget to click the like button
don't forget to leave me a comment on
how you felt about this tablet or if you
enjoy tablets at all or if you think
that this is a much more reasonable
proposition especially if compared to
like a an iPad Mini or something like
that but yeah leave me many comments I
appreciate all the words I appreciate
you guys watching this video as well
we'll see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
