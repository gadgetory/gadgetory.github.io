is a vlog if that's not already obvious
I made my way to the airport this
morning because I'm going on a little
trip just a day trip or go out to free
months in Silicon Valley to the vent
that's hosted by Asus and Corsair and
Kyle and I are going to be hosting it
gonna be games and prizes and hopefully
lots of people's Cup because the sucks
note showed up anyway I thought I would
vlog it take you guys along for the ride
so here goes
pardon me serious this week - I'll take
it that windows easily taken oh great
going out reality what expectation
alerted a plane just like I expect that
we're going to house a live stream and
that it's going to be fun okay I'm
expecting to great food is literally
free food grab onto this so we all gotta
settle balance up spent over Carl's jr.
mail and has the airport just now so
carry-on bags under the CEO on the floor
or there's an overhead compartment where
they can be stored these backspace
locked up right great serums a ground
well the ad and side laptop computers
power down a soda way are you ready to
go what do you say welcome aboard
FWA have a good three solid husband ten
out of ten
Silicon Valley is on a Saturday where is
everyone kind of windy this is not super
hot so we're at Corsair this is their
actual headquarters here in Fremont and
obviously they are planning on an event
today they have a tent over here the set
up our flag got in pretty early though
we just took a lift over for the airport
and there's like nobody here yet except
some Kyle Kyle he's hiding felt like
hiding here's scary one to scare you I
totally scared all you guys you're all
surprised well they probably saw you
just a few seconds ago in the airplane
so they know you're here yeah forgot
about that partners okay that's okay and
so no one's here
what do we wear should I pee let's just
set up to livestream well don't say
stream or you can live stream don't say
those words but not making this any
easier for me just seriously like am I
about to piss on Corsairs building don't
just go man my eyes are up here
oh just go respect me like a lady if you
pee pee on under there electronic
vehicle charging stations yeah see if
you drive an electric vehicle and you
work at Corsair you can just charge your
car while you're parked it's like
imagine if you went to work and they
just filled your car with gas when you
got there how nice would that be I'm
afraid that they've got some like
protection on it where it'll just like
zap me because I'm not a coarser
employee or something or do you have to
pay for it I don't know oh yeah you
probably pay for before at labor deal
there unlatches maybe right charged pay
to play
I've no idea I don't have an electric
vehicle although we just drove by Tesla
we did we should go by Tesla's go I bet
they're a lot cheaper here right I just
log about to get super cool probably not
good suit if he doesn't turn look at
this what
look at this look at course serious
setup here they have all sorts of gaming
systems and everything so I actually
have an ulterior motive for coming here
today not just hosting this event but
here's my mouse this is of course their
m65 I think I'm 16 I'm 65 right so just
actually have the old logo - yeah so I'm
bringing here - Justin okay I'm going to
upgrade to new and I got to upgrade to
the new one I got to get rid of the
cursor came in the logo so this is my
secondary thing is I got to bring in our
RMA here and trade that in okay so thank
you Justin I'll hopefully get a new one
I actually need I actually need more
mice
I got young people it'll soon there's
the outdoor area that they have setups
they got a little they got a few more
signups for this event and they
originally anticipating so they were
able to put up this they said this was
last minute but it looks pretty looks
pretty set up for me it was a little bit
here's the gaming arena the gaming room
exactly sure what's going on here but
look so they have a couch this is what
it told me a couple years ago when they
were I did a little collaboration with
them on a live show they said that to
get a couch in here so that's part of it
there's all the chairs for everyone who
comes in in person and then we're going
to be broadcasting a live stream from
right over here so here is where
everything actually happens this is
where everything goes right how it's
going to be rough your house can be run
in the show today the stream just shuts
down for whatever reasons because I
either said something I wasn't supposed
to or I tripped over a board rest
assured I will be the disaster so you
can get an overall doom but this this is
all this is all happening in the past
printing and watching this video so
everyone is already probably very well
aware of the chaos that you caused a
live stream
do you work for myself I've been made
for a moment to a moment where enjoyed
life young people ready
hey it's only for minute all right
so I found my one and only doppelganger
in life and that name is Justin Bieber's
of course there I'm so excited right now
I'm over the moon
Justin's going to start doing different
videos I will think it way around I'm
going to start adding RGB to everything
working course API over there yes I just
decided can't wait another question for
you guys a question of protocol for when
TSA sort of gently cups your balls they
thought there was something in my back
pocket there wasn't but they gave me a
little pat down what do you do when that
happens do you do you stay silent like
at a urinal when you're peeing you know
just look at the wall inferni do you
thank them I kind of said thank you
wait so when they do that that's not
because we're flirting with you no I
mean I assume those for security reasons
but I I said thank you he was very
gentle so probably shouldn't wink data
well Freud wait we're now waiting for
our return flight enjoying a bit of
breakfast I got a I got a ham egg and
cheese croissant
the Paulo is was your favorite was your
favorite part of this event meeting the
fans almost like with that spinach
finishing that is this right here and
it's about to end I
how many defense is really cool as
always I'm getting a chance to meet you
guys in person putting a face to the
name is one of the coolest things I
think about what we do
hard to Prasanna fie what our audience
looks like and how they are until we
actually get to be useful the diverse
group it's a very diverse group and I
feel like the more of you that we meet
the better picture we have in our heads
of what our anonymous audience looks
like that helps us sort of crap the
content for you guys more and just
getting to you guys it's awesome stuff
but yeah then meeting like your name of
course air is also fun excuse all those
guys JJ George I was really cool having
JJ and George there because they're like
old school we worked out in the course
to those ok one last question what have
we learned what have we learned on this
trip what what pearls of wisdom can we
share with people back home who weren't
able to join us
bring your plugs if you spare the hotel
where there's a bunch of noisy
disrespectful people in the hallways
streaming at midnight
alright guys I'm back at the parking lot
at the Ontario Airport where I started
this journey 24 hours ago I hope you've
enjoyed this vlog one of the things that
Kyle and I were discussing on the way
back is this was a pretty fun event for
us to go to just to clarify by the way
Corsair and Asus hired us to go and host
the event but this video is not
sponsored in any way shape or form I
just wanted to do a little vlog as we
went along
but the question we're asking ourselves
is should we do this more often it was a
cool way to go and do a fan Meetup and
actually get to meet and talk to a lot
of people I know it was local in Fremont
so let me know if you guys think it
would be cool if we could somehow
coordinate to do a few more of these
events a year going to other locations
perhaps in the US or even outside of
that let me know in the comments if you
think that'd be a good idea of course
thanks you guys for watching this video
I'm going to get back home start working
on some more content for next week so
stay tuned for that it comes up button
if you enjoyed it we'll see you next
time bye bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
