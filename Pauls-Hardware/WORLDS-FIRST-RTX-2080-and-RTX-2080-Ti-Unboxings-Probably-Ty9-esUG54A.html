series via the sponsor link in the
description what's up guys welcome to
Pauls hardware today's video is an
exciting one because it's been two years
actually over two years since nvidia
launched their 1000 series or their 10
series the GTX 1080 and 1080 Ti that we
have been forced to use as the best and
fastest gaming graphics cards for the
past couple years but now we have new
graphics cards the our TX 2080 the r-tx
2080 ti yes they're very expensive and
there's ray-tracing stuff that may or
may not be useful and all that to
discuss but for now this video is just
about the glorious unboxing process this
is the first time these are the founders
edition cards directly from Nvidia that
they've sent over so hopefully you guys
will be able to live vicariously through
me as I get my first look at these new
cards get them out of the retail
packaging so let's begin now full
disclosure I did already pre open this
box but I did not open the boxes that
are inside so you know I'm just trying
to do the full experience here make it
as authentic as possible inside we have
some pink foam and at first I was like
wow this is like an old-school product
lunch I used to get new graphics cards
that we're just launching that didn't
have any retail packaging yet and it
would they would always for some reason
pack it in this paint foam stuff but all
right we got two GPUs side by side here
20 80 20 80 TI pretty much the line of
course we are expecting there to be
manufacturer third third-party add-on
board manufacturers that will also have
1080 at 20 80 TI s and 20 80s coming at
you very soon since they're both
launching on September 20th but for now
I just got the founders Edition this
maybe I'll be coming back to you in the
future days with some other unboxings
and features of other cards there's the
founders edition retail boxes looking
very similar I will say to the founders
Edition retail box for the 10 series
which is right here at least in shape
they did change the outer design of the
box I will be keeping this on hand so I
can give you all side-by-side comparison
but where do I begin
the 2080 founders Edition retail price
is $800 $7.99 you might be able to get
third-party versions for a hundred bucks
cheaper than that at $700 whereas the 20
atti founders addition is retailing for
$1200 1199 so that means both of these
together is $2,000 worth of graphics
cards at least if you believe in videos
pricing I'm gonna say the best for last
and we'll start off with the 2080
honestly I'm expecting both of these
cards to pretty much look exactly the
same
as far as the cards themselves into the
box and stuff so now we get that nice
reveal as we lift it up I do think this
is looking just slightly different than
what we saw at the press events at
Gamescom I've got a tag on mine that's
new this is tag say not sure what this
tag is it looks like there's there's a
SKU here for the card itself and then
this is maybe a distinct serial number
but yes I can pull that off before I
remove the plastic key packaging bits
let's at least check out what else comes
in the box
alright so similar to their last
generation they are including a
DisplayPort to DVI adapter which is
simply because there is no DVI ports on
this card so if you have a monitor that
only supports DVI then that is handy to
have and then we got a couple booklets
here the r-tx 2080 Quick Start Guide
which is pretty long a bunch of
different languages now this is just a
basically out of the card showing power
connectors and basic hardware
installation so that's all stuff that
you've probably seen before where to
download the drivers and then a support
guide which I imagine is much different
this is all that safety information and
requisite stuff that they have to
include when they ship an electronics
product so that's fun a couple little
accessories that come in the box but
onto the GPU itself which has a lovely
assortment of plastic packaging the r-tx
20/80 has 2944 cuda cores a quarter
clock 1550
megahertz loose o'clock at 17:10 if you
go for the low lean on Founders edition
versions or at least that's the standard
base clock founders editions are gonna
have a boost clock of 1800 megahertz so
it'll actually boost up a little bit
faster than these supposed hundred
dollar cheaper versions that may or may
not actually be coming available at some
point there's a little peel off there
though do these have the secret the
secret peel of things on the fans I
think they do the first pro tip for new
r-tx 2080 owners is to make sure to peel
the plastic off of the central fan hub
as well as the r-tx logo writing out the
specs though eight gigs of GDD are six
memory in this one that's on a 256 bit
interface 14 gigabits per second or 448
gigabytes per second total bandwidth and
then probably what's gonna be the
biggest question is this new cooling
solution the first time that nvidia has
gone with an open cooling solution with
dual fans for their standard founders
edition card or reference design however
you want to look at it they are
including a nice backplate which is all
silver there and then if you're looking
at the side of the card that you're
probably going to get the view of when
it's installed in your case you'll be
able to see the backplate their two
power connectors here which is a six pin
and an eight pin although it looks like
the PCB is laid out so that you might be
able to enhance it and go eight and
eight or maybe we'll see that's change
with the r-tx twenty atti there's a
geforce r-tx logo on the side here and I
believe that will light up in green and
then we could see some of the fin stacks
here for the cooling solution that is
beneath and it does look like it's gonna
eject some hot air on the bottom and the
top of the card depending on how you
look at it shroud wraps are on the back
here and there's a imprinted and video
logo on that side as well and then for
i/o here on this side we've got HDMI as
well as three display ports and then
that USB C which can operate as a
display port out or it's also so gonna
support virtual link for VR headset
connections lastly over on this side we
have a cover for our Envy link connector
and that's the new connection standard
for two-way SLI configurations which is
definitely significantly different in
appearance and shape to your standard
SLI fingers and we're gonna have special
Envy link bridges that go with that too
but I like the little cap that they've
put on here is pretty clean covered
so if you're not using that blends in
nicely with the rest of the shroud
continuing on with our glorious unboxing
we have the arc TX 2080 TI which I'm
imagining is going to be super different
it is different when it comes to specs
and everything you get 11 gigs of GDD
are 6 memory with the 2080 TI on a 352
bit interface that also gives you an
increased memory bandwidth of 616
gigabytes per second and the box the box
is still the same though and the shroud
is still the same although I was right
that we have two 8-pin connectors now
instead of the eight plus six
just quickly confirming that our
accessory kit is the same except 2080 TI
for the QuickStart guide and you do
still get that DisplayPort to DVI
adapter continuing on with some specs
though this one has 4352
cuda cores so significantly higher costs
from 800 bucks up to 1200 bucks and I'm
sure will debate that more once there
are reviews and performance numbers that
we can talk about with these but pretty
big jump in costs but you also get a
pretty big jump in CUDA cores - from
2944 up to 4352
core clock 13 50 megahertz boost clock
fifteen forty five megahertz and the
founders edition boost clock which is
special up to 1635 megahertz and again
base price if you can find third-party
designs that are gonna sell for that
cheap should be $1000 and then this
founders Edition version costs $1,200
wow that's the first time that nvidia
has had a non Titan GPU that they have
tried to charge more than $1,000 for and
they just went right for it not even
like just sticking it to 999 or
something dec now we're gonna jump it
all the way up to 1200 and again I'm
sure there's gonna be plenty of debates
and then coming weeks as to whether or
not this is worth the money I'm inclined
to think it's a little overpriced right
now but again good way to learn under a
final verdict until I can run some
benchmarks on this but other than that
it's pretty much the exact same physical
design I I can't tell without doing some
disassembly which I'm not going to do
right now whether there's any difference
to the internals of the cooler but we
still have the two fans solution we
still have the open-air shroud with the
exhausts on either side and the only
real main physical difference here is
going to be the two 8-pin connectors
versus the eight plus six pin of the
r-tx 2080
now I will say when I was first
introduced to these GPUs at the event
back in Germany with Gamescom I was a
little on the fence about the design
maybe just just the angles they showed
it at or maybe it's just actually
holding it in your hands that gives you
a different opinion of it because this
feels very substantial it's a heavy card
there's a lot of metal going on in this
cooling solution itself so that gives
you the impression of a weighty and
valuable product I guess these are just
first impressions though so this might
all go out the window once I do a full
review and once I get to that full
review I will be able to test these new
cards or tests and share performance
numbers with you
comparing the prior generation to this
generation and actual real world gaming
performance for now though I can give
you a side-by-side comparison of the
former founders edition card and this is
the GTX 1080 was going to do the 1080 Ti
but it's actually installed in the
system right now I didn't want to pull
it out of there but there you go just a
quick side-by-side so you can look and
let me know in the comment section what
you think of the new design versus the
old design were you a fan of the old
design especially this slightly updated
tessellated version this design was
first sort of conceptualized back when
the GTX 690 launched and then it has
made some slight variations over the
years but this is the first time they've
gone with a massive and major complete
redesign going with a completely
different style of shroud and blower or
non blower cooler with two fans on which
again once we can share performance
numbers with you I'll be able to tell
you how effective this cooler actually
is I will say I think I like the shroud
better on this one it has the chromed
out r-tx logo there so I guess that's my
opinion on that such as it is but guys
that pretty much does it for this video
I know this has just been a quick
unboxing and kind of light on actual
stuff but the first impression at least
of the coolers I think has been positive
for me again it's going to come down to
price versus performance and what you
get out of these cards for actual games
that you can play right now but more on
that on my upcoming full review video
which should just be in a few days from
now so definitely hit the subscribe
button if you want to see those videos
when they come out hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed
video as well and let me know in the
comments section the answers to the
questions that I asked you like what you
think of these physical designs of these
and the aesthetics thanks again for
watching this video guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
