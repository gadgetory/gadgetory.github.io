drive but wait this is no ordinary flash
drive it's the Corsair Flash Voyager GTX
256 gigabyte and I don't even want to
call it a flash drive anymore I want to
call it an external SSD which is pretty
much what it is since it uses a face on
s9 controller and runs at speeds that
will put any flash drive you currently
own to shame
let's go through some of the flash
voyager gtx is bonafides before i move
into a video editing demo i want to
point out that this is a new version
model CM fvy GTX 3 B there was a version
without that B at the end that released
last year and but that one's dumb and
this one's much better ok this one's
just newer and has some new features but
hopefully it's obvious that this is a
USB 3.0 Drive which is also backwards
compatible with USB 2.0 of course will
also work with Windows Mac OS 10 and
Linux systems with no driver
installation necessary it's got a 5
freaking year warranty which is nice a
redesigned zinc alloy housing which
gives it some considerable heft for its
size and it also aids in heat
dissipation I will warn you guys that
this drive heats up a little bit when
it's in use it's not going to burn you
by touching it or anything but I can see
why Corsair essentially made this
housing into one big metal heatsink
physically it's not the largest USB
drive I've seen but it is a bit wider
than some so it could block some
neighboring ports depending on how
they're laid out on your desktop or
laptop PC there's a blue LED drive
access indicator light at the other end
which is thankfully not blinding but
there's also a keyring slot which seems
to get the job done I will say that a
couple of nice to have add-ons the
Corsair might have included here would
be a small USB extension cable for
systems with cramped port spacing and
some kind of strap or cord to retain the
cap losing the cap for a USB Drive is an
egregious pet peeve of mine so that
would be nice to have speed though
that's really what this drive is all
about and Corsair is making some hefty
claims here 450 megabytes per second
reads and 360 megabytes per second
writes based on their testing with a tow
430 megabytes per second reads 190
megabyte megabytes per second writes
that's with crystal disk mark that's
really fast so I'm going to run some of
my own tests to confirm those
radical numbers I also want to show you
guys what I'll actually be using this
drive for actually to replace this this
right here this is for editing on the
road this has been my solution for a
little bit of a time now this is
basically my sort of trusty USB 3.0 to
SATA adapter connected to an intel SSD
when i edit on the road with my laptop i
like to have my raw video files on a
separate drive from the operating system
and the premier cache drive which runs
off the laptops internal SSD my adapter
based external solution does work but
it's not quite as portable and i'm
constantly afraid that I'll break the
SATA connectors on the 2.5 inch SSD
because I'm always in a Russian I just
toss the whole thing into my bag without
actually unplugging the adapter ladies

or visit linda.com slash paul and after
a random transition to a quick shot of
nori asleep on the couch it's time for
some coffee table benchmarking that's
the best kind of benchmarking right so
here's what I'm going to be doing as I
wanted to double-check Corsairs numbers
they're listing on the package for this
drive and then I also wanted to sort of
give some real-world comparisons between
what it can do what I usually use it for
or what I what I intend to use it for
and if that if it actually makes what
I'm doing better
I hope all that makes sense alright so
for comparison I have of course the
Flash Voyager GTX which is which is
right there
okay nice and pretty I'm not going to be
comparing this one this is the flash
voyager GS it's actually like just
arrived honestly like as i was setting
up for this so this one is a little bit
slower not quite as fast as a GTX still
up to 295 megabytes per second reads and
up to 290 megabytes per second writes
depending on we're using to test it of
course and this is a 512 gig one so if
you guys are interested in capacity
maybe or speed but not quite as much
speed as a GTX the GS is also available
that's another option but for comparison
i'm going to be throwing in the flash
voyager GT right there the USB 3.0
version that's a 64 gig one and i've
been using that for some time now it's a
very fast drive but not as fast as the
GTX is supposed to be now I'm going to
be doing like the straight up crystal
this mark and Acho benchmarks on these
two drives right here and then I also
ran for just for a basis in comparison a
test on my internal SSD
that's the Plextor m5 pro as you might
be able to see right there and this is
direct-attached serial ata so this is
going to show you kind of some of the
limitations you get when you're going
external with like a USB 3.0 as opposed
to internal SATA so this is like SATA
read rev three or so 523 megabytes per
second reads 460 megabytes per second
writes that's about what anyone should
expect whether you're talking about a
desktop or a laptop drive so I'm going
to run through some screenshots that I
took here really quick we're going to
start off with a toe this is just
running at the standard settings so
queue depth is four it's running
transfer sizes of 0.5 all the way up to
8 megabytes and you can see all the
results right here remember it lists
these in kilobytes not megabytes so for
instance 322 here is about 322 megabytes
per second 460 is about 460 megabytes
per second we're supposed to hit 450 on
the reads and 360 on the right so we are
getting up to 460 on the read so that's
definitely achieved there for the writes
we're actually hitting about 322 so not
quite up to what it said on the box
however this is not a benchmarking
system this is a laptop that has
use and if I went ahead and gave this
like the best possible scenario I'm
guessing I could I could coerce it up to
get up a little bit higher but apart
from that I wanted to show some
comparisons here so let me jump over and
at least do my best attempt to do that
so here's looking at the GTX the Voyager
GTX on the left and the internal Plextor
m5 purr on the right this is not a fair
comparison m5 pro performs much better
again because it's an internal drive and
all that stuff I said also keep in mind
the scale on the right goes all the way
up to a thousand so yeah we can
basically see here's what you might
expect for an internal drive here's what
you're seeing for this external drive
still very good performance overall but
let's give it maybe a bit more of a fair
comparison here so let me jump over to
my Voyager GT results and we'll put that
up side-by-side so here you can see this
scale by the way goes up to 200 on the
right and this scale goes up to 500 on
the left so here you can see the Voyager
GT which had a much more reasonable for
a flash drive about a hundred and ninety
megabytes per second reads was the
highest that got up to rights didn't
even get up over a hundred so we hit 85
megabytes per second most and that is
definitely one of the limiting factors
for external drives like this so here we
can see a very vast difference in read
and write speeds going from the Voyager
GT to the Voyager GTX just as expected
next up here's a look at crystal disk
mark again the Voyager dcx results are
on the left side there and you can see
the reads getting up to about 400
megabytes per second the writes here
peaked at 180 megabytes per second and
that is again just shy of what we saw in
the retail box which for crystal this
mark was claiming 190 megabytes per
second on the rights and about 430
megabytes per second on the reads reads
seemed to suffer a little bit more in
this test as well but again on the right
I've got the Plextor mm5 Pro which is an
internal drive which isn't a fair
comparison but just to give you guys an
idea of what you could be seeing here so
looking at the Voyager GT numbers again
we can see where the GTX kind of shines
and that is with the reads going from
150 up to 393 the writes go
one from 73 to 191 79 and then
especially if you look down here at
stuff like your rights in the queue
depth 32 area like oh my gosh vast vast
difference here and 4k numbers are very
important
don't don't count them out they're not
as impressive as the big sequential
numbers and everything but I'm going to
show here in just a minute how small
file size transfers are very important
in lots of situations and my real-world
test here is pretty simple basically I
have what I consider to be a very
challenging thing for Adobe Premiere to
do I'm using Adobe Premiere cs6 by the
way and that is to load up one of my
time-lapse configurations when I do time
lapses I usually end up with something
or in the 2,000 to 5,000 image count
range that I need to load all up into a
single project in order to render out a
time-lapse and whereas most of my
projects which are 1080 and aren't all
that complicated and load up pretty fast
even on something like a laptop to say
nothing of my my desk or my desktop
workstations which are pretty powerful I
think this is something that I typically
see Adobe taking a little bit more time
to do and that's because it's dealing
with all of those tiny little files so I
have one time-lapse project here that
I'm going to load up and I'm going to do
it four different ways I'm going to do
it off of my external SSD right here I'm
going to do it off of the internal
Plextor SSD I'm going to do it off of
the corsair gtx of course and then i'm
also going to do it off of the Corsair
Flash Voyager GT
still thinking
still thinking
there it is finally there's one more
thing I wanted to show you guys in here
though before I move on to that final
test and that is this little indicator
weight right here
interphase UAS P that is USB Attached
skuzzy protocol not all systems are
compatible with that newer system should
be if they have USB 3.0 natively but if
you're not getting like the Mac's
performance out of this Drive that
you're expecting it might be because you
have an older system that's only
compatible with BOTS VOT which is a
belief batch folk book only transfer I
forget what that stands for but ua @ ua
SP came along with USB 3.0 it's faster
and it's able to actually use some of
the SATA protocol hooks so it's better
but I'm happy to say that the drive
automatically in immediately just worked
as you ESP you ASP when plugged in here
I didn't have to do any fancy
configuration stuff to get that going
but anyway here's what I'm going to do
now I have two of these sequences queued
up to render two of the exact same time
lapse sequence that I've shown you guys
before one of them is going to be coming
off of the internal drive writing to the
internal drive then the second one is
going to be picking up everything off of
the Voyager GTX but then writing the
rendered file to the internal drive so
let's see how these two play out run one
is finishing up elapsed so far is about
three minutes and 22 seconds we are
coming down to the wire here again this
is from the internally rendered
time-lapse and my goodness we have an
entire three seconds difference it went
from 322 to 325 so my my theory here
about how my example it's not my example
showing a significant difference one to
the other I think was probably limited
by the complexity of the project itself
I was expecting many small files to give
this a bit more of a challenge to work
with but the internal SSD being a very
fast SSD as it is I think was pretty
helpful there and also the fact that I
wasn't really doing anything at all in
the background so it was able to
concentrate entirely on
the render however rendering from this
external stick was still a little bit
faster and you can imagine extrapolating
that out to say a much more complex
project or say a much larger time-lapse
for example this project was about four
thousand images ultimately though I
think where this is really going to help
out is for people who maybe don't have
quite as high quality of an inter
internal drive going on or if you just
have lots of other stuff going on with
the system and even though timewise just
this example I showed here wasn't the
significant difference I think it could
make more of a difference depending on
what you're doing and I also do like the
idea or just the general best practice
of having a separate drive from your
operating system and to your programs
drive to keep your RAW files on and that
sort of thing it also means that it's
being stored in a separate location too
so there you have it folks
and if you're interested in other uses
for this drive aside from what I've
already shown well it's of course great
for large file transfers that kind of
goes without saying or you could even
set it up as a bootable operating system
drive for dual boot or recovery purposes
I'm sure there's other uses for this
drive too so let me know in the comments
what you would do with this external SSD
aka the Corsair Flash Voyager GTX 256
gig before you move on to the next video
