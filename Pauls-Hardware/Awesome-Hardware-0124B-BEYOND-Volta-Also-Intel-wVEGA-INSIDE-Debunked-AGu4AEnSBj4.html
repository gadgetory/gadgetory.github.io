second just a brief moment or two here
hello everyone and welcome welcome all
of you who are joining us for awesome
Hardware this is awesome hardware as a
show it's awesome
it's about hardware we stream live to
youtube.com slash Paul's Hardware that's
my channel also to youtube.com slash c /
bit wit which is Kyle's channel we
stream the first half it's a Kyle's
channel already that was episode 124 - a
so if you didn't watch that and you
wanted to sort of see where we've been
and where we've got come - to the point
we're at now didn't check that out link
is in the description although I
probably need to update that because I
don't think I did that
really I'll fix that fix that very soon
brief warning we do drink a few
beverages here and we do perhaps have
some adult language that comes out from
time to time so if you are not
comfortable with that then perhaps you
should look elsewhere for your tech news
but yeah let's let's let's get right
into it here first off we have some
stores and if you guys are interested in
supporting our channels and the stuff
that we do in the content that we make
check out our stores we have an ongoing
t-shirt design contest and we have a
winner
a winner for the contest but when you're
smug Z well we cover winners that's true
yeah mudsy made the RGB everything shirt
which is now available
you guys can purchase it this is awesome
that is my favorite design we love it
coming we both we both thought it was
really cool super well thought out ran a
very well designed to um John who does
our store was able to basically take it
and make it into a shirt without very
much work at all which which is great
when you print he's and stuff we have
some awesome Hardware merch so if you
buy the the swordfight shirt for example
that was made by Brian or more if you
get that our TV everything shirt the
proceeds are split between me and Kyle
other than that the rest of the stuff in
my store I got some bottle openers got
some mugs pint glasses hoodies sure
ball caps all very high quality
merchandise so check it out at pulsar
Burnett Kyle's store is also available
at bit width tech slash store Jesus he's
dropping stuff ok there's my phone it's
fine
along with the RGB everywhere and other
awesome part my merch Cal has a beware
of bottlenecks is available so you guys
you guys purchase that thank you Steve
for that design available in a couple
different colors and made by Steve so
thanks study guys have been submitting
designs to us and feel free to check out
our stores if you gonna submit more
designs also ongoing right now but but
ending tomorrow is my giveaway of this
computer made by main gear like hey you
said celebrating six hundred and fifty
five thousand four hundred eighty two
subscribers yes I is the milestone we
all aspire did I was waiting for it here
this is very specifically a turn to
turned right there oh I got it live I
got it live you know most people's
favorite numbers is like 47 42 23 Paul's
favorite numbers his lucky number is six
hundred and fifty five right there so
exactly Paul an epic system an AMD risin
7 1800 X 2 GTX 1080s in sli full custom
water cooling loops by main gear with
parts from ek fittings from bits power
coolants quick disconnects an nvme SSD
960 pro it's a super awesome system so
check links in the descriptions to enter
if you haven't already are you are you
going to sign the system it any and
anywhere that should not currently plan
to completely packed up already I'll
wait on the winner I mean if they ask
for it I can probably pull it out and do
it do that or something that the value
be too terrible value it I've done that
before so so yeah anyway that's Maxie
way yeah so so so endeth the beginning
of the show introductory stuff I'm gonna
try that to burn through the show fairly
quickly today because we started kind of
late yes because I had I was not ready I
was not prepared
Avenue Sam board you do we should tweet
you test it
which sounds great can you do dude do
the fun one do this we're gonna do the
fun one how do you we're gonna go up to
24 here oh there we go
so our side was just now our sound board
can do fancy things yes like apply
effects no not yet Oh ready so we're
about to both turn into like demons
ready I will destroy you and everything
you love how does it sound
is everyone enjoying awesome hard work
should we make a new awesome hard work
and show or do both sound like this and
we talked about awesome hardware and how
awesome is I hope you will burn in
flames of a thousand assholes
next time we give this we'll use
headphones so we can hear ourselves ok
there's 24 there's 24 different effects
that we can use we were now broadcasting
to you from hell live live from home
sweet so there we go
having pros by December I did I did do a
brief unboxing and a quick test to this
video on that will up I'll post later
this week this is clearly a best tech
show on the Internet just sayin
alright understand cheers still you guys
thanks for being with us here right now
we're drinking Lagunitas book loco
Tangled Tango Foxtrot Foxtrot text yeah
you get the reference there correct yeah
WTF WTF a multirow best jobless recovery
ale doesn't know what that means
Lagunitas brewery has some random it's
really good though it is quite tasty
alright
starting out with tech news over on
Anandtech they had a little little blurb
here about Nvidia's I don't
and stuff they're talking about it's
over that's the events going on in it
where is it in Europe yeah it's a good
robot GTC Europe 2017 going on right now
so Nvidia they talked about car stuff
and usually when a video talks about car
stuff you're like all right and video
let's move on to it let's get rid of the
GPU stuff pretty much this actually does
have some trickle-down some crossover
with the mainstream GPUs in that
apparently this unit that they're
talking about here the Drive px Pegasus
actually is using the next next
generation of Intel GPUs in sight until
GPUs I'm sorry NVIDIA GPUs oh I've had a
few drinks okay this is Nvidia teacher
this is a videos first level 5 system
and we've talked about autonomous
driving before and there's different
levels in it level 5 is like the full
thing completely autonomous drives
itself no human interaction to be
sleeping the car drives up and you get
in and the car drives you to where you
want to go and that's and that's what it
is ok this is a big step for them when
it comes to the hardware that they've
developed that's capable of doing the
things that needs to be done in order to
have an autonomous vehicle which is
scanning lots of information that's in
front of it analyzing objects and that
kind of thing and determining the best
way to drive without killing people good
but inside this unit they have two
unannounced post Volta next-gen discrete
GPUs yeah you might actually see what it
looks to be like four units here this
appears to be probably a couple of the
GPUs and a couple are the SOC s
according to the article this is the
holy grail of what NVIDIA has been
building towards over the last few years
because NVIDIA has been doing a lot in
autonomous vehicle technology and
driverless car technology because it is
a field that potentially has an insane
amount of money to be made within it oh
yeah yeah so you can get in on the
ground floor than that
- I do now to be clear this was
announced today dev kits in this unit
won't be available until next year
NVIDIA is only shipping big volta are
the large voltage Eevee 104 compute
products recently if you're in the
enterprise space if you're in the retail
or the mainstream consumer gamer space
you're still dealing with the Pascal
garbage that the trend voice doesn't
litter useless crappy Pascal 10 80s and
1080p eyes while the enterprise has
their full - I'm throwing away my 1080i
yes here is its eighties it's going in
the garbage they're horrible smash it
with a hammer first it but volt is
exciting of course but there's already
Volta product shipping this is this is
the generation after volts on if you
look at any of the roadmaps they only go
up to Volta
we haven't seen any of the leaked
roadmaps that have anything beyond that
but obviously and Vidya does have plans
and stuff in the work in the works the
heart or hearts of this pegasus units
are going to be to xavier SOC vidya has
been developing they combined and
integrated Volta GPU that has Nvidia I'm
sorry Volta tensor cores integrated into
it as well with unnamed octa-core arm
the CPU at with an unnamed octa-core arm
CPU design okay so that's the SOC they
kind of run this the show and then of
course the host Pascal based GPUs are
what do the heavy lifting there's a
little bit of deduction done here in the
article because the overall unit here is
supposed to have a 500 watt TDP but
still supposed to be air-cooled which is
somewhat impressive it is supposed to go
on a vehicle so you might have a
different thermal environments that
they're dealing with no is this
something that's gonna be shipping with
cars natively by default out of the box
one so to speak when you get them or is
this gonna be something that you can add
to a car to make it the car would
probably need to be designed with this
integrated in
but this is also an early announced unit
probably what this is going to be used
as for development purposes whereas in
two three four years when there's
actually vehicles that are being
developed with this integrated they're
probably gonna have newer technologies
the hardware is probably gonna not get
it not gonna be exactly the same okay
but they do have some specs based on it
here including some teraflops numbers as
well as of course DDP as well as DL tops
which is a AI benchmark number that I'm
only just familiarizing myself with
which I assume means to order pizza Sri
securely
that's probably I'm probably only saying
that because I'm hungry anyway um but
500 watt TDP air-cooled based on the
other component tree that goes into this
units the good folks over Annan antics
have deduced that there's probably
around a 220 watt TDP left over for each
of those two GPUs and those GPUs
probably most likely are the exact same
GPUs in the exact same architecture and
maybe even the exact same silicon that
would be also be ported over it to be
used in desktop GPUs as well that's why
it's somewhat interesting from the
gamers perspective but it's hard to 20
watt TDP is fairly high as GPS go so
that would make them high-end G X 100
Class G X 102 class GPU designs right if
they're following the naming conventions
that's Nvidia is used for volta and
Pascal and so on yeah these devices are
going to be targeting commercial
applications in it Robo taxis and
driverless long-haul trucking so we've
talked a little bit about autonomous
vehicles here it's coming it's going to
happen and it certainly seems like one
of the key areas that's people who are
developing in this area are looking at
is basically where a lot of driving
happens with which is taxis jobs where
the job involves
driving for a large portion of the time
long-haul trucking so if you're in those
fields I would follow this pretty
closely yeah you might be out of a job
pretty soon yeah because there's a
serious potential here for these types
of things to overtake a lot of jobs that
people do right now and discussing the
outcome of the potentials of that trend
is beyond the scope of what we're gonna
do on today's show cuz we've been
drinking we're not yes we have
deal with it we're not qualified to talk
about any of this okay so let's move on
yay so there was a bit of a hubbub over
the past few days about blue Intel
potentially having a cpu with Vega with
a Vega GPU or Vega GPU cores integrated
into it this was actually originally
from a site called nasty Lima tech mess
nasi lemak tech comm it was METEC it was
picked up and regurgitated by WC CF Tech
and WCC F Tech along with several other
websites basically helped spread the
information like oh maybe this is thing
of the work with them and Vidya I'm
sorry with Intel and AMD but um it's not
true anyone who's heard any of this
stuff recently it's not this is the
reason why a lot of the times when we
bring in a WCC F tech article to you and
show you guys stuff about it we like
this is a WCC F Tech are taken with a
grain of salt take it with a grain of
salt but there's lots of other websites
as well that have been kind of duped by
this so and it kind of just explodes
from there all you can use is one source
and then everyone thinks it's true yeah
cuz it's on the Internet
it must be so this originated an action
and pulling up WCC F Tech right now
because I wanted to look at the article
itself and see if they've posted a
correction because this has been
corrected and the information is no
longer true no they have met I mean
I don't know there's nothing in this
article that they've updated incorrect
so this is the picture that this is all
basically still getting which is
like oh it's blurry and granulated and
it says Vega inside and maybe that means
that Intel because this looks somewhat
official maybe that means that Intel is
developing a CPU that actually has Vega
internally no that's not the case where
did they say that was picture was even
from or taken that was actually taken
it's it's from an Intel facility but
it's because Intel has a program going
on and this is from a tech critter comm
with the expose on this story intel has
a program going on it's part of an
employee approach appreciation program
where they take their employees and they
blow up their ears and they make posters
of them I'm sure it's not awkward at all
standing inside and they put the name of
the employee and inside inside because
their employees calling something right
there's a pollen side oh that guy's that
guy's he's an imposter Paul you're that
guy I don't trust him Paul inside trying
to assume your identity so yeah
Intel in their efforts there's a person
amused employee morale or whatever an
employee named Vega did this thing and
yes there's an employee named Vega so
there's a guy that Vega insight on it
and a bunch of websites picked this
story up and started being like what's
Intel working on with and with Radeon
technologies if you're at the freakin
event you would've known right so um
it's not true it's been debunked the
original hold on but okay but can we can
we argue whether or not this would make
a pretty compelling offer if Nvidia and
Intel teamed up to make some killer yes
you it would be a hairy it would agree
it would be a very interesting story
it's super exciting
Intel has denied it every time they've
been asked about it they categorically
said no that's not happening and we're
not working on it so this is wouldn't
they had everything to gain and nothing
to lose because AMD is both of their
competitors all right well right
wouldn't that make sense like it
APU partnership between Intel and NVIDIA
I don't see why that hasn't happened yet
I mean because you know there's probably
some glaring reason why why they don't
work together on something like that but
yeah I just feel like for the consumer
awesome this is where the story
originated on that's still the Matt
techcom who posted as they should have
done update false alarm guys with
additional information about it I caught
this story because Ryan shroud from PC
perspective was tweeting about it and I
will say that anyone who's reported on
the story who's not posted an update and
clarified things with people you're
basically seeing they're leaving their
story up there as a clickbait thing that
people will click on and read and be
mislead so that they can get more
traffic and make more money and it's
kind of BS yeah so shame shame to anyone
who is doing that was it wasn't by anthe
I don't know was it the middle of at the
end me Chad Pegasus TSMC hey we're
scrubbing through the tweak town website
with no adblock origin going by fast a
patriot it's a Christmas miracle if it
is still there it might be buried or
something like that don't watch the
latest Star Wars trailer because I heard
that it's full of spoilers oh really
that's what wifey sauces brother
informed me of I enjoyed it
oh yeah you didn't think it was to
spoilers that's spoilery yeah all right
I'm not seeing here I'm done tweak down
so maybe they took it down but when I
was on tweak town earlier I swear to God
I swear to god they're loading up a
crypto miner I'm through their website
oh I'm I'm I don't know what I got IND
8% I wouldn't all right let's move on
get some nice alright
AOL AOL Instant Messenger have you did
you did use that back in the day for you
we have to have used of course halo
instead yeah I remember receiving like
as a youngin as a youngin as the longing
little chode I remember receiving like
the AOL discs in the mail
oh yeah right and then um we only had
one get like 800 free hours per month or
so yeah and we loaded up one of those
things to it like my parents still use
an AOL email well they should still be
ok with their AOL email but but but a IM
AOL Instant Messenger ok is is gone is
kaput it's going ok it's going the way
of the dodo okay it will be discontinued
well who even uses that anymore that was
all the rage back some people apparently
still use it well if you guys can
remember some some of the lingo and some
of the information that goes back and
forth and ya know wow so yeah able
announced on Friday they're
discontinuing a I am a loyal Instant
Messenger
one of the first widely used equations
to the messaging apps some some classic
this is on the Denver Post for some
reason some classic dialog here ASL
please age sex location age sex and
location corn and that kind of we all
know that's how you communicate with
people on the internet that's why I say
to people in real life to my meets male
hey hey ASL what's it's exactly
lizzi's I get myself perfectly normal
and when people for social but yeah one
of the first widely used chat programs
launched in 97 yep 20 years that's been
around over a hundred million users was
where it peaked in that back in 2001 if
you remember buddy lists you have your
buddies buddy list
you can set an away message such as
people would know where you would do it
what you were doing where you were well
I'm jerking it
BRB jerk even in it exactly in fact is
predated like afk and
okay yeah yeah for me I feel like I
started afk and that was like in the
world Warcraft days like mentally - yeah
yep
that's probably where that originated
before that you had an away message
that's true believe people information
be able itself was fiercely protective
of their dominance of the instant
messaging market which they had fairly
early on because AOL was very popular
service for accessing the internet
before people realize that you could
just have a direct broadband connection
and that AOL wasn't the Internet um but
yeah they fended off many rivals
including Microsoft by blocking their
messaging platforms from communicating
with alo users and my experience has led
to the use of many third-party program
and several different third-party
programs that could communicate on
different instant messaging program
different instant messaging platforms
and I believe I was trying to remember
the name of the one that I used for a
while but I feel like it was called
Trinity but I don't think that's right I
think it was it was try something try
because it was like AOL and MSN and like
one other were the main ones you could
use to communicate with trillion
trillion trillion nuclear music yes
trillion and trench one two five three
used not exactly trillion that's exactly
what I think you have thank you I love
how chat just knows what you're thinking
yeah of course it's just like anytime
you're like I don't know this thing
chats like here's the thing because 815
minds are better than one
absolutely show you Thank You Chad
thanks Jeff for filling in that void in
mind by memory alright y'all sleep at
night the parents company oath which is
the combination of AOL and Yahoo we've
talked about on the show before I said
the platform's demise is a casualty of
the evolving way people communicate
since there's a many of their options
right now well yeah I am
the program itself Excel will continue
to function until December 15th after
that users won't be able to mine and all
data will be deleted Wow
incidentally since you said your parents
still have an AOL email address there's
also people people with AI m.com email
addresses this
work those aren't going away so the
email service if you happen to solve one
of those here your emails not gonna
disappear okay all right couple more
stories Equifax Equifax
equit Matt Becker freaking screwed up
the asses is more like it
we've talked about that fact situation
on the show several different weeks last
looked they basically got hacked they
lost the information of every pretty
much every single person in the United
States who is used currency before ouch
they have now announced that the 2.5
more million are also affected by this
hack so if you weren't among the
original 144 million or so maybe now
there's a wonderful likelihood that you
are it seems weird that a number like
2.5 million should seem like a drop in
the bucket compared to what they've
already screwed up with but um with this
information now in the hands of the
public who is of course applying a hefty
amount of scrutiny to Equifax as well as
the other credit reporting agencies and
be like why what are these companies
about and how do they work and how do
they exist in everything well that's
going on the IRS has awarded a
multi-million dollar fraud prevention
contracts to Equifax worth seven and a
quarter million dollars what so this is
a no-bid contract and just file this
under like what why what what so they're
giving them yes the IRS is giving them
seven million dollars after all this
happened
yeah the shitshow gave in contract worth
more than seven million dollars too cuz
to verify taxpayer identities and help
prevent fraud under a no-bid contract
because well if everyone's getting
screwed over by Equifax then maybe
that's more work for the IRS in the end
maybe I mean there's a trickle effect
maybe like everybody its crew my echo
back
their credits though not maybe the
numbers are now the IRS has like
their hands full with a bunch of bitch
work to kind of I don't know bounce back
from this fiasco
maybe the 7 million dollars is really to
help themselves like they're like ok
we'll give you all the support you need
just to make our own lives easier cuz as
far as I know the IRS has never done
anything for anyone other than
themselves so I can't imagine that
they're actually just bailing out
Equifax out of the kindness of their own
heart this has to be something that is
is affecting the IRS in a real way
already that they're like okay was this
like it's worth the money we already
have everyone's money we've
already taxed everyone for 2016 and
never year prior
we'll just give you this money to
somehow fix it yourself maybe maybe it's
like hiring a maid service you know it's
like someone took a in the middle
of your living room like well I'd rather
just give you 7 million to clean it up
and have me clean it myself
type of thing I don't know I'm
spitballing here listen to me
we are Equifax unity will do as we bid
you you have no other choice subjects
all right uh yeah much there was not
much commentator the main thing I want
to point out when it comes to Equifax
watch out for fraud there's gonna be a
bunch of fraud going on this holiday
season oh yeah watch out for tax return
fraud there's gonna be a bunch of that
going on come the first quarter of 2018
if you are at all worried about this
which you should be if your American
citizen potentially consider freezing
your credit and definitely file your tax
returns as early as you possibly can
come 2018 ok everyone's really loving
those facts by the way oh yeah all right
so whoo let's move on we have a sponsor
spot all right so our guys deep deep
pool is sponsored awesome hardware for
the month of October deep cool of course
makes a bunch of cooling products as
well as computer cases they have a wide
array of products and today we're gonna
be showing you very briefly
ok great sweet and all right about
the deep cool captain to her de X which
is an all-in-one liquid cooler
it has a 240 millimeter radiator hey
there's just a white version on coughs
after the show we showed you guys the
black version it also comes in white so
the whites is on the actual pump block
unit here as well as the radiator itself
as well as the fins on the radiator
saves you the trouble of having to spray
painted white if you're going for like a
white theme system or something like
that and if you are looking for an
all-in-one liquid cooler and you wants a
white themes build and you want RGB
functionality as well yeah well this
seems like it's right up your alley
the RGB implementation is around the
sort of ring here the reactor ring as
they call it so you can pretty much make
that whatever color your heart to your
heart's content which is pretty cool all
the cables are either black or black and
sleeved so you look pretty sleek
especially the ones coming off of the
waterblock really nice guys we've been
connector there the fans are PWM four
pin I believe and it does also include a
fan hub you get a fan hub or a fan
splitter I should say for connecting
like four or five fans which is pretty
cool the Williams are white - yeah the
white edition fans look pretty cool too
I like the black and white that's nice
yeah there's a little bit about
rubberization on the corners for some
sound dampening effects and they have
like these slots in it which I mean
those slide you things either have to
improve the cooling or at least they
just look cool
so guys deep cool I'm sorry gamers storm
that's where you can go to check some of
this these products have and a big thank
you to deep cool for sponsoring awesome
hardware and I spend the fan this
episode is powered oh and one last thing
this kit also comes with a little RGB
controller unit if you can't plug it in
directly it's compatible with
motherboards from Asus with the aura
sync from gigabyte with RGB fusion MSI
with mystic like gaming mystic like
gaming asrock with RGB LEDs but if you
don't have a fancy motherboard with any
of those things it also comes with a
little control unit that you can use as
well as an additional RGB LED strip that
you can integrate with it to get
yourself yourself elites that is that is
the best one I think is when
manufacturers give the option to control
the LEDs be a hardware or software it's
all about choice it is all right thanks
deep cool Thank You deep cool for
sponsoring awesome part
move on let's close that move on to what
Paul what is next
hon have you heard makes this hot and
heavy hardware whoo look at that lower
thirds 4000 we're talking about the half
of the HP did you post your video why
not it is uploaded now and I can
actually post it right now if I wanted
to we're like what am I just posted like
while we're live so how to talk time on
halftime everywhere we're gonna start
off with a discussion about the half the
half h 500 p cooler masters newest case
originally shown at Computex this year
had a lot of hyper in it a lot of people
who were excited about this case and i
think a lot of it had to do with some of
the design which looked pretty nice yeah
I think so it had to do with the legacy
of the half series because it's been
around for quite a while and when it
first came out there were quite a few
variants of it that were very popular
mm-hmm
and you know it just it it this there
were some pretty impressive looking
videos screenshots thumbnails and
everything that went up it went up a bit
at Computex true now gamers Nexus good
old Steve as well as of course snowflake
like snowflake is the cat ah snowflakes
the cat right he he did his review of
this and he as you can see from the
get-go here he's having a hard time you
watch did you watch it I did you I
thought it was very well done so Steve
all right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna
critique Steve when have you ever tried
to lift a case this way let's see have
you ever seen how he's lifting have you
ever gripped a case that way
not really right have you no not
necessarily
but it was for theatric fact it was a
direct effect and it's not like he
doesn't have a point it certainly is
true he also the opponents that it was
exaggerated yes the front panel and top
panel do come off way to ease more
easily
then you might expect but I've done a
video on this case Kyla has done a video
on this case it's not up quite yet but
listen right now
you're literally posting it right now
right you're you're you're doing shade
on my nose i close to your video right
now just leave everyone go watch Cal's
video right now it'll be up in the next
two minutes watching asta partner give
me two minutes
okay so continue on so point being
Steve's video came out this morning he
was one of the early ones to have it up
because apparently they changed the
bargain over to 5:00 a.m. and so I
didn't keep track of the time
I was like I know what's on this day
that's all I don't know I knew it's been
very polarizing but yeah he was sure he
was fairly critical of it due largely in
part to the front and top panels right
also too due to the well he yeah he
critiqued the air flow which is that
that of all of his critiques I think was
the most notable because he did read
some thermal testing on it which which
I'm not much more much more in-depth
than either of us went mm-hmm
he also critique that there is a
vertical GPU mounts which if you use a
vertical GPU that has a taller PCB which
many GPUs do have third-party designs
that it conflicts potentially with the
air cooler that might be positioned
above it now I also wanted to point out
that there's others who reviewed this as
well OC three need net for example is
one of them and OC 3d nets what are they
they have lots of nice pictures and
stuff like that I mean there's some cool
features of the case some some covers
for some of the cable management and
that kind of thing some panels that go
in the back here and whatnot OC 3d that
give it their ultimate award really yes
okay and in fact the video from OC 3d
not met by a tiny Tom Logan was very
complimentary I was not able to watch
the entire thing 25 minutes that's
actually relatively short for a TTL
video but he went over the whole thing
and he was really stoked on it so I
think this just goes to show that
different people have different
experiences
yeah and that it is important when
you're looking at reviews of any given
products especially when it's something
like a case which might be a little bit
more subjective then something like a
CPU or it's just like how fast is this
and run the rest and what it what it
comes down to right you know it's
important to take different varying
viewpoints into account I think a lot of
Steve's criticism was very valid sure
but at the same time I built in this
case and I had a bad a reasonably good
time with it
um same here you know there was there
were some aspects of it that stood out
to me is maybe that ideal right but
there were a lot of design elements that
that worked pretty well and I thought at
least internally
I mean it's built like a tank internally
internally yeah as far as far as that
goes right and it was an interesting
idea that they had with with the dual
cover system that they had going on for
the the cable management powers oh right
different different positions that
people used with that you know that kind
of thing right
it did seem like a little bit
challenging to pull all that stuff out
but I don't know it's it's like I feel
like there's the perspective that you
look at a case from from like our
perspective where it's like I'm probably
gonna be pulling stuff out of that
within a week
regularly yeah versus somebody who's
like I'm gonna build a system and it's
gonna be there for a year and so like
cleaning damage or something like that
which which is a different kind of
experience so right anyway um I
definitely agree with Steve on the
panel's being very loose and just not
seeming secure at all um especially I
think when it comes to us reviewers
we're constantly moving around our
hardware and that even goes for like
full-blown systems right we build a
system we're moving that computer that
full-blown desktop from A to B we're
moving in we're tweaking it like moving
it ran from this desk to another and I
felt like just picking up the half or
the H 550 500 P just was difficult it
was difficult because at least the the
top panel or the front panel would pop
and it didn't seem as secure as a lot of
other cases I've handled in the past got
it you got a grip at the base you got a
grip the base but I mean you shouldn't
have to just only have you shouldn't
have to resort to only grabbing the case
from one area I feel like when a case is
said and done when you've built the
system in the case and you wipe your
hands clean and it's finished you should
be able to just grip the case or grabbed
it from any position and move it from A
to B without any trouble but I felt like
the panel's were unnecessarily loose for
some reason that I could not find when
they could have just used like st was
saying the the very cheap alligator
clips to just make them hold in a little
bit more more securely because
ultimately at the other day
safety first kind of applies not just to
your own mortality as a human but also
to the hardware that you're using and
building with so I felt like safety
first applies to the system that I've
just built as well and I could easily
see someone like carrying the full
system not being familiar with the with
the the case the chassis itself and
accidentally slipping off like the top
panel the front panel and having the
case you know the whole system take a
tumble or whatever there are a lot of
things that coolermaster did right with
this case but I also feel like cases in
the last 5-10 years have come so far
because now when you like $100 a $100
case is not the same as a $100 case five
years ago that's very true
and I felt like with a hundred and fifty
dollar MSRP with the H 550 H 550 p 500
500 500 P you can get pretty much
eighty-five percent eighty to
eighty-five percent of the features with
a hundred dollar case as you can with
the H 500 P nowadays so it kind of boils
down to like is that extra are those
extra few features worth it to you as a
user to pay a $50 premium over this case
and and again that's it's all gonna boil
down to you as a user but I felt like
just for the basics like the panel is
that the very least should have been and
like in my review as you guys will see
if you watch it like that was the one
thing that
kind of hit on throughout the video Mike
I still can't believe how loose these
panels are just as I'm going about
building it's great when you're building
you need to take it off because it comes
off like butter but at the same time
there were just certain things that you
would expect from a hundred and fifty
dollar case here in 2017 that just
didn't live up to the expectation I
guess and it's also I feel like
coolermaster kind of had it tough
because there was so much hype around
this case that oftentimes it's hard to
live up to that hype and it's even more
difficult when you're charging a pretty
hefty premium for it so yeah they were
saying like 140 I think it Computex it I
feel like maybe the hype bumped the
price up a little bit yeah maybe yeah
but impossible age 500 P wasn't the only
case that Coolermaster launches today
actually they also have a master box MB
600 L which is a must much more
reasonable $50 50 or 49 us master box MB
600 L features an acrylic side panel so
unfortunately it's not a tempered glass
we have been seeing some more reasonably
priced like 6 th dollars tempered glass
side panel featuring cases from like fan
texts and stuff like that it's a
standard now it's it's come standard but
a burglar comes standard
the case itself and there's actually
some better images over here in the
cooler master set fantex
blue masters say itself but yeah it's
got the free-form modular design so it's
compatible with the other master box
series upgrades and add-ons that are
already available there's three
different colors so you've got red
accents blue accents or silver accents
that come on the edges and it's got
black with a brushed metal front panel
there's actually a couple different
versions this one here has a five-minute
quarter inch bay on the top you can also
get it without that five and a quarter
inch bay so either way depending on
whether or not you need that
expendability it comes with a single
hundred and twenty millimeter fan only
and there's no exhaust on the top but
you do have some radiator support up in
the front 240 or 280 millimeter rads can
fit in the model that comes with
a quarter-inch Bay or you can go all the
way up to three hundred and sixty
millimeter three by 120 red on the front
if you go with the version without that
acrylic side panel and there you go
looks pretty clean yeah pretty clean
yeah basic I'm behind it 50 bucks yeah I
mean I was I love that I love a solid
$50 case because for a budget build you
just be like you need to spend $50 on
your case yeah here's here's a good case
yeah it's that kind of thing so yeah
come so far this one's looking pretty
clean
I would I would want to compare this as
far as features and build quality to be
300 or be 300 or some or one of the ones
like we said that that have the tempered
glass side panel because again this one
is acrylic it's a pretty clean looking
acrylic piece but these are just images
you know acrylic still you suffers from
the scratch you'll easily scratch not
quite as durable and that kind of thing
but anyway that shiny that's the master
bucks last thing for a hot never
Hardware here this is actually from
reddit's and 10 Gigabit Ethernet any of
you guys interested in that for some
high-speed transference between your
home devices or whatever this reddits
thread is more specifically about
devices based on a quantity know a QC
107 controller which there are a couple
of from Asus and gigabytes and if you
actually go to these links Asus has the
Asus XGC 100 C for $100 look at that
that red heatsink on there that is bold
red PCB there's $100 for that one or
gigabyte if you want something that's a
little more subdued the gigabyte GC a
q-see 107 also a tengu bit Ethernet
although apparently temporarily
temporarily out of stock on Amazon for
$100
so yeah make sure they normally I
haven't even like prob
I feel like prior to no it's been about
170 hundred eighty bucks if you just if
you just need a 10 gig
yeah Ethernet card to grant it to drop
into a PCIe slot so a pretty decent drop
in price significantly more affordable
than they've been before of course and
as pointed out in the article you got to
have a switch or some other way of hang
up that's ten gigabit connection to
other devices in your home this isn't an
antic article that was linked in the
comments on that writing article this is
actually all the way back to June but
talking about some lower-cost 10 a 10 G
based e switch is coming for five and
eight port a quantity of solutions at 30
bucks per port but I thought that was a
picture picture still a 30 bucks report
for an 8 port switch you're still
looking at well over $200 so that's you
know not cheap but a lot cheaper than it
used to be sure okay so there you go if
anyone's interested in 10 Gigabit
Ethernet which I believe as I'm doing
some upgrades to my home yeah I'm
probably gonna hook that up I do very
frequently transfer video files that I
capture out here in the garage back to
the editing system back there and I'm
speeding that up would definitely be
useful and hey what 10 give it 10
Gigabit Ethernet you don't even need to
transfer you can just use the Stuber
it's on the other computer did you
notice that the was the Maximus 6
extreme the X 299 board from Asus came
with a 10 gigabit cord I think the ports
on it are 10 10 you
well not just on them is a virtual
boarding card like a PCIe card or PC
yeah I probably didn't look close enough
yeah it's a 10g on it I was like oh yeah
that's a nice bonus maybe able to use
that for something hey I mean if you're
gonna spend in 650 bucks on a
motherboard then right having something
like that and there is makes it a little
bit more worth the money my laptop died
I forget - oh alright let's move on
our final segments is gonna be sword
fight and we're gonna be talking about
briefly a quick story which actually I
discovered through
level one text so Wendell and company
over there watch where they have a
weekly tech news show but they do their
posts usually ever late Monday night so
much more legitimate than Armitage yeah
they they go over way more stuff than I
do but cosmos magazine story basically
has indicated the physicists have found
that we are not alone living no we are
not we're not living in a simulation no
dammit there's been lots of speculation
I'm like no maybe we're living in a
simulation Elon Musk many others have
been like well what if what if there's
some really advanced civilization and
they've developed some really advanced
computer programs and that's all we are
is computer programs and whatnot well a
team of theoretical physicists from
Oxford University in the United Kingdom
has shown that life and reality cannot
be merely simulus simulation simulation
simulation simulations generated by a
massive computer supercomputer you got
this yes do you mind if I go to the
bathroom real quick yeah go for a run
okay so simply put just a fake I don't
know the dogs are braking so simply put
they set out to see whether it was
possible to use a technique known as
quantum Monte Carlo study I'm sorry
known as quantum Monte Carlo to study
the quantum Hall effect which is a
phenomenon in physical systems that is
exhibits strong magnetic fields at very
low temperatures and manifests as energy
currents that run across temperature
gradients indicating an anomaly in the
underlying space-time geometry
I've lacked that for a second of those I
was that talking just now more to the
point that physicists the physicists in
Vault their last names are wrinkled and
compute okay easy breezy breezy they've
shown though that attempts to use these
quantum Monte Carlo systems to model
systems is exhibiting these anomalies
such as the quantum Hall effect will
always become unworkable basically
because the complexity of the assimilate
simulation is increased exponentially
with the number of product particles
being simulated this is usually the type
of subject matter that I like to embark
upon discussing after I've had several
drinks anyway I hope I've not been
slurring my speech too much as I've
discussed this but the point is if you
want to simulate something like let's
try to simulate what's going on right
now what these scientists have
discovered is that if you try to
simulate it at the quantum mechanical
level it becomes exponentially more
difficult to actually simulate which
means that a computer simulating that
simulation would like there would never
be enough computational power to
actually run that simulate simulation
because the simulation would become more
and more complex so as to make it
impossible for even the most powerful
computer to simulate that because the
reason for this being even something
that's able to be done has been like oh
well computers keep getting more and
more powerful if computers keep getting
more and more powerful than eventually
of course computers will be powerful
enough to simulate everything therefore
what we are doing right now might be a
simulation but of course these
scientists have proven this wrong so
Kyle this is of course now very
well-versed with the subject matter
because he's been listening to
everything I've been saying you haven't
run over that again real quick No
you use some timer to break I'll run
over it again real quick for you
something up very well so these
scientists ring Gill and Kaviri they've
set out to the see whether it was
possible to use a technique known as
quantum Monte Carlo study to study the
quantum Hall effect a phenomena a
phenomenon and physical systems that
exhibit strong main magnetic fields at
very low temperatures and manifests as
energy current that runs across the
temperature gradients indicating an
anomaly in the underlying space-time
geometry okay
know in English you need to speak my
language here fall i-i-i gathered about
five percent of that the other 95
percent is lost on me sorry I'm not
smart I get it okay I understand also i
understand all this completely you're so
inept oh hey hey let me I'm gonna try to
explain this because that at the physics
I don't understand I don't pretend to
understand that but I do I do feel like
I understand the underlying principles
here okay which is alright
computers keep getting faster and faster
okay which has allowed people to believe
that as computers get faster and faster
and we developed software that can run
simulations on them eventually those the
computers will be powerful enough the
software will be complex enough the
simulations will be in depth enough that
what we are experiencing right now could
potentially be a computer-generated
simulate simulation that's being run on
the supercomputers somewhere right okay
that's I like Elon Musk has talked about
this yeah
he's worried like maybe we're all just
run it maybe this is all just a
simulation right what these scientists
have discovered is that if you try to
simulate reality down to the quantum
mechanical level the complexity of the
of what needs to be done by the
computers in order to simulate it
becomes exponentially more complex right
which means it's impossible that what we
are experiencing right now is a
simulation it's like reality's too
complex machine to process basically
TLDR yeah okay that's all that's open it
I couldn't so today behind that oh yeah
I can understand that high level good
good good that's all that's all we
needed for me
gotcha so with that being said with that
being said we move on to our very very
important straw poll topic which I've
just posted in chat all right that we're
gonna argue about right now which is now
that we know that we're not leaving in a
simulation and everything is
terrifyingly real and happening right
now what do we do do we have a few
options here
panic lose yourself to a life of
hedonism and excess I just keep on T CB
n PC beam was that taking care of
business
okay play a video game maybe the sims
mmm buy sell or have another beer let's
make these arguments brief yes I will
have another beer house can argue to
have it in the beer that's because
that's the right answer to everything
argue that that's the right answer
I'm gonna pee too everything might get
more beer here's the reason panicking
does no one any good
panicking has always led to more people
acting more stupid and losing their
lose yourself to a life of hedonism and
excess well we all know how that goes
I'm living it right now I am living in
peer excess with all these riches and an
inglorious glorious objects around me
here in Paul's garage you can see as a
human with literally every conceivable
piece of computer hardware that III
might my heart might desire I am still
deep down they sad and lost so so we can
skip on that one just right off the bat
just keep on taking care of business
that's that's a runner up that's the
runner that's probably my second my
second my second choice or they're
playing video game okay that could be my
third choice The Sims maybe not the Sims
if you asked wifey sauces well that was
one of her favorite games back in the
day but you know I'd probably I'd
probably consume myself with some doom
maybe some counter-strike we'll see us
go I don't know super smash brothers
melee I don't know about the Sims though
that's just the Sims you had me up until
the Sims so let's skip on that bye-bye
that just cost money sell that that is
just that's much that's too much work
like do you how much time and effort it
takes nowadays to sell something at
least on the internet or anywhere really
you have to like there's a whole process
you have to go through selling is a pain
in the ass you might as well just donate
it or give it away or destroy it if it's
not usable clearly the only option here
is have another beer and that is how
I've voiced my case
Paul perfect time it's not really by
arguing my point but just talking
on all the other one this is freaking
bottle openers I'm gonna use this again
oh okay is that the screwdriver really
it's nice how effective isn't a chemical
spirit alright thank you it works well I
thank you so what would your choice be
Paul I chose have another beer because
I'm right I would choose lose yourself
to the life of hedonism and excess which
is basically first mistake my answer
because let's be honest how many of us
are really considering that seriously
how much living in a simulation affects
us in our lives I'm probably not that
much
maybe maybe you've dabbled in it maybe
you've thought like maybe that's the
thing that's kind of weird to think
about but seriously honestly not that
much effect so to me it just comes back
to like well what do you do on an
everyday daily basis what's your typical
mo jerkin hedonism in excess season
summary goods that's why we good at
let's I would give a Las Vegas every
yeah every January okay but there you go
but it's let's see what you guys had to
say about this one I'm sure Kyle
argument Kyle had a little bit more time
than I did I sure did
but I had these I've been trash on
talking trash in your answer have
another beer yeah yeah oh you win I am
so I am so convincing around when you're
not here you're right when you're not
here to argue like my game was the only
second second choice I did come in third
with hedonism in Texas there's only
similar that's option 3 I did get a show
in there that's true but I am in the top
50% all right so Jesse that told you
that was sword fight it was epic as
always yep and we're gonna move on to
some Q some Q a human and some Johnson
shoutouts yeah let's start off with the
donation comments oh I fling poo for
$5.00 and my kid is using an older 11 11
50 core i5 4690k is it okay to is okay
to gain ot time or time or time to
upgrade lot of times I think I think
you're okay yeah no 46 it's a quad core
46 in any case solid processor I think
you're good yeah it's your kids computer
so it's not I mean GPU is really what
you want to look at as long as you're
not pushing for like some really high
frame rate 1440 gameplay or anything
like that for for 1080 and even some
some basic 1440 stuff depending on the
GPS yeah okay
lined up with it yeah I think you're
good me too okay
$5 gentlemen El Jefe is drinking a glass
of drinks jefe wise Oh
that's brilliant pun Thank You ivy
thanks Scott dalvik once again $10
donation is for dog treats
don't let serene hero hear that I gave
norian hero a dog food right before I
locked them out of the garage before we
started the show cuz they were there
being all needy here's Fred riot $50
dollars for bottle opener and a razor be
clean-shaven next week Paul lol Fred
I've never clean-shaven I I get I get my
neck is shadow gets irritated five
o'clock shadow clean shaven sir I only
ever go over it with clippers I have a
like an ensign aiming a beard or
mustache clipper and I use that to buzz
it up so that's what you get you get
donate more than fifty bucks you're
gonna see Paul clean-shaven the moral
story Fred been so long since I've been
clean ship yeah living mediocre $5.00 I
enter into every single giveaway so that
I can finally upgrade I'm still on my
AMD FX 8350 M
there's the odds be ever in your favor
Jeremiah
boy it's $5.00 where do I send you guys
beer also which is more of an upgrade in
gaming over an i-5 37 50k risin 5 or K
be like Core i5 first off you can send
this beer to either of our P o boxes yes
they are in the direction of our videos
on YouTube as far as your upgrading
question I think risin 5 would give you
more bang for the buck because you can
probably get within 5 10 % of the gaming
performance you would with cable a Core
i5 and you would get SMT which
accumulate core i5 does not have hyper
threading so you would be limited to
just the number of cores that you have
no no extra threads there and
additionally you get a little bit of
upgrade path with Verizon on the a m4
platform you can potentially upgrade to
a CPU with higher than more than what
was that for 6 cores that you might get
with Verizon 5 all right I guess it
would be 6 core sorry 6 course you can
get you know you can upgrade you have an
upgrade path there whereas cable a core
i5 not some
unless you go to an i7 but that wouldn't
be a massive upgrade either so I think
just in the interest of money and
upgradability upgradability
upgradability yes well-spoken sir yeah
Thank You Jeremiah Thank You Jeremiah
Steve Finley from the 20 Canadian no
comment there's the best addition we can
ask for can hear you so much tongue
breads myths brems myths sums for 100
Norwegian Crona Thank You Thomas I'm
learning so many new currencies where's
this more than one Tom well then there's
Tom's
multiple of you yeah okay personally the
first cloning in America okay here in
Norway coffee Lake will be available
after December and he's planning upgrade
to 80 600k for my 7600 okay because I
need a new motherboard anyway but now
I'm looking for Rison because of the
upgrade path that's kind of what we're
just discussing yeah and you can't go
wrong there can't go wrong
yep I agree thank you very much Tom's
over the ten Dara if I sent you my old
77087 80 rocking a 1080 right now and
paid for both return and send shipping
and handling would you all sail Paul
Kyle hero header a random hobo of your
choice sign it and send it back pre yeah
I mean sure see reason why not yeah well
sign some for you yeah why not sure
only for you thievery nobody else letv
nobody else says it's a sign tales about
the Sun is easy hearty geezers are
hearty 58 that's fairly Australian
no comment thank you very much thing is
easy thanks a night significant
Ryan D $5 what advice would you give to
someone who hasn't built a PC in ten
years the hardware options seem endless
CPUs main boards power supplies cool
cases watch lots of videos I guess or
lots of articles information mine it is
if you if you were into pcs 10 years ago
nothing is more complex
than it was ten years ago everything is
the same or simpler than it was back
then
so you're in a pretty good position if
you have a good handle on the basic core
components of hardware that go into
computers CPU memory and motherboard
case power supply storage graphics card
all that good stuff then you're probably
in a pretty good spot and it's just a
matter of familiarizing yourself with
the platforms that are current and out
and available right now and all of them
launched in 2017 for what's available
right now amphora AMD thread Ripper on
AMD mainstream for Intel would be either
skylake 1150 Ireland 51 or or
or coffee like 1151 right or Intel
high-end anyway yeah so you're in a good
spot just just so ya watch videos watch
our videos both me and Paul both Paul
and I have some good past videos
everything for first-time builders or
people who haven't built in a while
Fred rained $5.00 IRS was not wearing
glasses when they popped the court yeah
right that's why we love you supposedly
was just one guy okay
$5 do the extra PCI lanes from thread
Ripper gives significantly better
performance in an SLI configuration
compared to something like the new 8700
K no not I don't think so not
significantly you typically going from 8
to 16 lanes because like 87 3k you have
16 lanes PCIe so if you have two cards
in SLI you're getting 8 to each one
which is which is adequate which is what
NVIDIA requires yeah there's a little
bit of performance drop off when you're
comparing 8 to 16 lanes PCI Express but
there's also a trade-off there because
you get better single core performance
with an 87 or 2k and so even I haven't
tested this directly there's probably
gonna be some tests of this directly
coming out fairly soon I haven't seen
any of it right now as far as SLI
performance goes right but um yeah
there's there's trade-offs and both
sides yeah

dearth of female viewers and our little
circle here so thank you very much
inferno dude five British pounds hey
guys just wondering if motherboard ended
up to s SD slots use CPU PCIe lanes or
the motherboard chipset PC a lanes
because the i7 8700 K only has 16 lanes
depends on the motherboard yeah it's up
to the motherboard manufacturers in
Turin where those how those PC lanes are
delegated for most of your allocated z3
7087 RK motherboard at least that I've
seen most of the 16 PCIe lanes are gonna
go to your PCI Express slots and most of
your MDOT twos are gonna be running out
from the ships off of the chipset yeah
just cuz it that's kind of how Intel
designed that platform you also get a
little bit more functionality off the
chipset because you can you can combine
and I believe up to three devices for
raid and a bootable thing but there are
all limited by the bandwidth of the
chipset so you don't necessarily get max
peak performance out of them yeah next
thing we've got something from Leeds
that's a Korean Korean I find a thousand
in five thousand Korean currency good
morning I am your Korean fan Korean one
green one I am your Korean fan I always
enjoy watching thank you using google
translator that's awesome
beautiful it's a it always pleases us to
know when we have international viewers
watching our stuff makes us feel more
connected together be South Korean one
South Korean one we must clarify yes of
course
I have thanks to our show had you been
in North Korea Thank You Korean fan
thank you can we invent I visited Korea
once South Korea it's fun was lovely
just could have created we should go to
create together ok let's talk to Samsung
shoot a lot yeah andrás Amadeus live at
$5 hey guys always liked both your
videos question as people who build
computers a lot how do you guys deal
with windows licensing do you never
license om much our most is the one-off
builds that I do for testing and that
kind of thing
I just don't lie since it and when it's
Windows time you can use it for
indefinitely as long as you don't want
to do personalization stuff right for
any computer that I'm planning to use
long term what I've been doing for the
past year or two has been going to
kinguin K ki ng UI n dotnet some of the
only one and spending about 30 bucks in
getting a license and it activates and
it works and then and then you're fine
I know there's a lot of hate around
sites like that like resellers but I
have never had a problem with them yeah
as far as Windows 10 keys go legitimate
I had never I think that's legitimate
complaints when it comes to video games
and developers and the stuff like that
but when it comes to the Windows 10 keys
they are keys that are global keys that
are made for because you you know you
can charge 100 bucks for Windows in the
US yep you can't in a developing nation
where people have way less money than a
typical consumer in the United States so
they still want to get Windows there so
they have to sell it for less money
so yeah I'd say I'd say the the main
downfall that I have seen from ordering
keys off of kinguin personally is that
sometimes the key won't work initially
if you're just trying to type it in
through the through your system you
exercise your phone in to the callin you
did the callin and then wait I mean if
that's totally fine though I mean you
take a little bit longer but it's
totally fine I've never had a key like
straight up not work so FY Heather
Hansen once again my wife $10 $10
hi Paul you get $10 since Kyle
complained about my $5 super chat what
well Kyle be thankful for your donations
anymore thing love wifey and I like if
she signs I'm like love
nice nice good like good person good
hearted Samaritan and so thoughtful
nobody said thank you I've never done
any wrong to you I'll see you later
I will see you later tonight okay we got
wife
Fred Rance who actually has two
donations buried what those scientists
were the developers of simulation and
just trying to make sure we're not
figuring yet friggin no don't don't come
up with those amazing theory don't say
that lines like that Fred yeah what are
you writing an HBO series ice
 contain this like written it's like
cut and dry so it is don't print don't
look don't spread your doubt some are
saying that the sound is speaking now I
really said if we can turn up the
compressor compress maybe pressure level
for maybe the volume has been fine this
whole time we've just been getting
louder cuz we've been drinking more
possibilities five $100 if Kyle will
shave Paul on next week's show now he
did not specify what part of you I would
be shaving so I feel like that's open to
our interpretation unless you know of
course he donated another hundred
dollars to clarify what he meant by that
but I would think so we got this in the
bag man hundred dollars here's a
question if I had to shave you though
what part of you would you want shave
the least my taint
fortunately shaving your team probably
just my ballsack joking face my wife can
actually uh easiest question it she's
good your wife I might rest but I don't
think you'd want that to happen that
would be awkward for those of you who
have no context whatsoever my wife she's
a licensed aesthetician she's just
naturally good it moving people all hair
anyway James Anderson $85 why doesn't
anyone seem to use Intel Quick Sync with
something like OBS performance hit is
virtually none
and you can use the IGP you you paid for
I feel like that's generally because
your graphics card can do a better job
at it so it kind of negates the negates
the need for something like quitting
I've heard a lot of people who use it
when they're on systems that don't have
as much DP horsepower as much CPU
horsepower don't have the discrete
graphics option right there have been
some tests that have shown Intel Quick
Sync video quality to be not quite as
good as doing CPU encoding or GPU
encoding so that's that's that's
certainly a consideration but yeah I
like Quick Sync I like what it does I
like I like software that takes
advantage of it for I think at least
from my situation I just I have enough
CPU horsepower to be able to do it x86
no problem and yeah and you get a little
bit better video quality for my
understanding that way so that's that's
that's why I made that decision I get
makeup spectrum gaming and tech $5
planning on starting my channel soon
love both your vids question you think
the 90 gtx 980ti is still good just ask
him because I have one yeah of course I
mean it was the best video card at the
time for the most part for gaming what a
year and a half two years ago which
means it's still gonna be a really good
GPU I mean people who are even like a
GTX 970 still are getting pretty decent
frames in modern triple-a titles so I
think you're just fine what you got but
on that note please well there's one
more spiky sound we skip $5 donation oh
yes love the videos fellas prediction
ETA and Volta also wifey sauce is cuter
than you Kyle
hashtag teammates are stating the
obvious first note there's no no depth
to that
Etienne Volta I don't know like mid mid
20 team Nvidia probably would have
launched a new GPU at some time this
year if a magnet pushes and push them
more writing that I didn't so and video
is kind of like all right we got backlog
of yeah
stuff we worked on so who knows I mean
the second half 2018 is probably one
receivable that's my opinion
okay that's reasonable
yeah and I'm gonna say Computex right
yeah June maybe year that's first half
is it January February March 1st quarter
April May 1st and yes yes first half
June still first time yep
