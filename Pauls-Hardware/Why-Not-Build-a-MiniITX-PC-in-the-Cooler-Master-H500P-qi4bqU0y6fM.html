click the link in the description for
more information what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware today's video is
gonna be about this case right here the
cooler master 1/2 h 500 p the
half-serious stands for high airflow and
cooler master they kind of set the
standard for case design back in the
2000s with the half series if you want
to know how far back this goes when half
first came out like a painted interior
on a case was a premium feature it
wasn't like every case I painted
interior some of the earlier half cases
actually didn't that painted interiors
but they have a whole lineup of them
that they launched and then it sort of
petered off for a while but they're
bringing it back this is the H 500 P
it's got two massive 200 millimeter RGB
fans at the front so I'm just gonna
build a system in this case today and
I'm going to let you guys know how it
goes and maybe gives you some feedback
towards the end of this video so in
order to build the system I should
probably have some parts to put inside
is gotta have memory let's keep it real
with some coolermaster stuff I got the
master air ma 610 P air cooler with RGB
lights compatible with all of the
difference ASIS or asrock RGB LED
gigabyte RGB fusion and msi mystic
lighting all compatible with that right
there coolermaster the standby v6 50
power supply nice all blacks cabling on
this one of course their vengeance LED
RGB memory a 16 gig 2 by 8 gig set for
the cpu gonna go with the intel 8700 k
the new cpu that's part of their coffee
Lake line up really good overclocker on
this one 6 cores and 12 threads and
there is some excitement about intel
actually bringing higher core counts to
their mainstream lineup so might as well
drop in the 8700 k for some storage
since this already has Windows 10
installed on it I have the Samsung 960
grow nvme SSD pfeffernusse 12 gig which
brings me to graphics card and
motherboard Asus actually sent me some
stuff recently so I was thinking I'm
pretty sure I know what's in here let's
let's go with this graphics card the
Asus Strix Radeon rx Vega Edition so the
custom Asus version of the RX Vegas 64
and they said they'd send me a Z 370
motherboard - so this is the ROG Strix Z
370 - I gaming motherboard which I'm
sure is a very good motherboard because
you know asus rog they do a good good
job with it
it is mini ITX though okay let's just go
for it let's go for it there are my
parts let's put this bill together
all right so give them the H 500 P out
of the box first impressions it's a
really really nice looking case you know
when it comes to aesthetic things like
you know the shape of the mints and
everything on the side it can be hit or
miss depending on a manufacturer's
intents and where they go with it
this I don't know I just like it I think
it looks pretty clean somewhat
industrial kind of futuristic looking I
guess but more specific to the specs
this is a tempered glass side panel
piece right here it's got a single screw
in the middle and that you need to
position this way to keep it closed then
there's a latch and pop that open and
then the side panel will just kind of
fall open there fall partway open not
all the way off and then you can lift it
off the hinge works pretty good for IO
up on top we have a headphone and
microphone jack a couple USB 3.0 and a
couple USB 2.0 ports you got a reset
button right there hard you have active
activity light and then there's these
appear to be two lights on either side
these aren't buttons so not sure if
those just slide up RGB like the rest of
the case or what and then of course the
power button dead center I'm getting to
the point with cases where I'm going to
start complaining that there's no USB
type-c I'd love to see a USB type-c plug
up here and if it connected to a USB 3.1
gen2 port in the back all the better as
well now apart from the tempered glass
there are two plastic pieces sort of
slightly smoky plastic here on the front
from top to bottom as well as going
across the top there's ventilation along
the top up here it's very wide and
there's plenty of space between the
plastic and the fans as well and of
course all the ventilation going in the
sides that will provide a little bit of
filtration as well as air gets pulled
into the case by those two big fans
all right so discovered that our
vengeance RGB memory is going to
conflict with this cooler and the cooler
is already installed so the memory is
going to be the easiest thing to swap
out so Corsair I promise I'll be using
your vengeance RGB memory and something
nice very soon
for the time being we're sticking with
the tried and true standard the
vengeance lpx low profile which is gonna
give us plenty of clearance therefore
that cooler and the cooler has RGB LEDs
on it and it's got a little league
coming off of it with just a little 4
pin plug it may or may not have already
shown you guys so there the the CPU
cooler has a little 4 pin plug and the
motherboard has a single RGB LED header
but it's the fancy new one that's
digital so the little three pin digital
connector which is really cool if you
have addressable digital RGB LEDs
because there's a lot of fancy effects
you can do with those that you can't
with normal ones but I cannot just plug
that into that will not work so I'm
gonna be going with Plan B option and
again all of this could be easily like
done away with by just going with the
full sized ATX motherboard that has more
room for the memory and more RGB LED
headers on it
my asus strix x2 99 board for example
has this header as well as the four pin
header so that anyway our cooler master
master air ma 610 p cooler does come
with a little control unit though with
just a molex plug so we're gonna plug
into that so we can at least have the
LEDs going on this unit
so here's our half broken down with all
the modular parts removed at least as
far as I can tell and I wanted to show
you a few more of the features right now
one is this crazy rail system that they
have gone on the top it is centered and
actually this piece this entire piece
can be removed as well with the screws
you can see like here and here so you
could remove that to install your
radiators if you wanted to before
reinstall and that that's a very
convenient thing and also as you can
probably speak see a crazy amount of
support for a hundred and twenty
millimeter or 140 millimeter based fans
in three are I believe three or four fan
configurations depending on which size
fan you are using so that's pretty cool
there is a similar configuration
although you can't remove the piece at
the front for the radiator but tons of
support up here for radiators as well
and two fan configurations you might
notice the drive cage down at the bottom
so if you do have 3.5 inch drives you
can't pop them in there it is on this
rail system that allows you to slide the
drives out however and do note that the
drives are sliding up forward here I'd
be interested if you could flip that
around possible you'll be able to slide
them out the back because these pieces
are the modular pieces that came off
this one here was on the left side and
it's got a couple 2.5 inch drive mounts
on top and then this one here was on the
right side there's also these metal
panels right here and those are
basically cable protection routing
panels so there's one that goes right
here that prevents you from seeing any
other stuff back there if you're running
cables from the front and then this
wider panel also goes on the back behind
it to hide the cable management area
from the back or keep those in a little
bit tight here now those are very
convenient and nice to have for sure but
I do want to point out this large pile
of screws right here these are all the
screws that I had to remove in order to
get all of these panels off not a huge
or insanely crazy amount but do bear in
mind for example that there really is no
way to mount the power supply through
the back of the case or mount the power
supply even from this side of the case
it's pretty much closed in so you need
to pop that panel off in order to get
your power supply
there is a dust filter behind that so
that is good to have but just something
to keep in mind if you ever have the I
mean people don't swap their power
supply is very often so it's probably
not going to be a huge issue but I have
had power supplies fail and that would
mean that you probably would have to you
can potentially even remove your entire
motherboard into a full system to tear
down in order to replace set but that's
a little bit of speculation there anyway
the upshot of course is that you get a
crazy amount of modularity so you can
use these panels and not use them
depending on whether you like to look at
them or not probably you will end up
using them to hide a lot of those cables
and then these it's nice to have them in
two separate pieces so you could for
instance leave the front one off if you
wanted more easy access to those drive
cages and the this one you'll probably
keep on most of the time because most
people like to have that nice clean
power supply basement looking area
so they'll put together wool weird cuz
mini ITX and the power supply cable
length was just barely enough to get
some of these locations but overall
internally the build quality is
fantastic I like the layout there's so
much room to work with we were not
taking an advantage of it at all because
we were shoving everything up into a
mini ITX formdecor don't put a mini ITX
motherboard in this case the only reason
I did it was because I only had to Z 370
motherboards and I already used the
gigabyte one so I wanted to use the Asus
one anyway let's fire her up for the
first time hopefully I did things right
hey I think that's good as long as it's
got enough juice to turn those turn or
millimeter fans at the front it does
just barely so guys here is the
completed build at least for now two
hundred millimeter fans in the front Joe
and I have both noticed these are very
quiet one of the great advantages of
turn ability of fans one of the great
reasons why I have been a fan of big
fans
haha in the past so glad that they're
there and actually look really clean
sooo you can cycle through a bunch of
different RGB effects and I am happy to
say that wearing these front fans as
well as the fans on my cooler together
has allowed me to sync them all together
a very in mind that the motherboard the
accent lights on the edge of the
motherboard as well as the graphics card
are not synced up right now because we
haven't loaded up into or a sink and you
would
if you use maybe a larger size
motherboard that had the RGB out on it
of course be able to connect all of
these RGB LEDs together with the
motherboard and sync everything up
together as it is I've just been
controlling it manually with that little
units that's included and I will say
it's nice to have that because it means
that if you don't necessarily have the
RGB capabilities on the motherboard you
can at least set everything up and get
it looking pretty and color matching and
everything right now I have everything
just going red because that's what the
graphics card was defaulting to so it
matched a little bit better but as you
can see with the side panel on you get a
really nice view of everything inside
very unobstructed and very much an
indicator that again mini ITX
in this case makes no sense there's so
much more room for other activities and
that kind of thing in there as well now
I can't make any comments as far as
actual thermal performance of this case
because I'm not doing anything that I
would call scientific testing today I
think most of my dilemmas with this
build were just the fact that it was a
mini ATX board so most of the cable
management routing holes that are over
on the right here I wasn't able to
access for the bottom stuff down here I
have a bunch of stuff routed between the
graphics card and the motherboard coming
over it here and that's not ideal either
but I was able to get everything in
there and functional and up and running
there's also the ability to cycle
through some different effects so you
can pop in there take that's what I did
there so there's flashing there is sort
of a fade that will fade a single color
you can also have it fade between
different colors this was what they had
going on when they were demoing this at
Computex which looks pretty cool also
these these LEDs do a very nice sort of
pinkish purple which i think was pretty
cool there as well and then of course
you can just flash between colors I
really like the flashing effects I think
they're too abrupt and not very pleasant
and then you have this one which also
appears to be a fading between different
colors but just a little bit faster and
then that's back to solid and then the
other button will just let you cycle
through colors so you get blue yellow a
lighter blue kind of turquoise ish a
sort of pinkish purple white red green
and back to blue so there are the
options there's my first impression
first look first ever build in the
cooler master H 500 P the new launch of
the half series I hope you guys have
enjoyed this video if you did a person
thumbs up button and let me know if
you'd like to see a another build in
this may be one that I'm not just sort
of thrown together with parts I have but
one that's actually purpose-built with a
bit more thought behind what's going
inside thank you guys so much for
watching this video though of course if
you enjoyed it hit the thumbs up button
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
