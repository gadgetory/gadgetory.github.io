can sleep I can totally mentally time
you should and I interview - these are
all feign you should feign interest oh I
have some vaguely interesting like a
second probably swing back I mean just
you just at least like I can I I'll act
interested I can see through it and be
like cows totally just just you know
phoning it in right now but as long as
you're phoning in it as long as you're
making that call oh yeah that's all so I
mean that's how fast I've got your half
of the show on on speed dial
sure we should be live to YouTube now so
hey everyone and welcome to awesome
hardware this is a live show we talk
about technology we drink some beers we
do it every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time and we stream live to
switch TV / awesome hardware we also
stream to each of our YouTube channels
we already did the first half of today's
show which is episode number 116 on
Kyle's channel which is bit width and
link to his video is in the description
if you missed that maybe check it out
it'll show you how we got to where we
are right now which is slightly toasty
yeah and I don't know we'd it's warm and
you've had a drink oh yeah California to
pound a beer on his half of the show so
that he did - so there we go
he was a champion at that I might have
the show we're going to talk about some
some monitors some HDR displays and some
space stuff and in videos Volta
architecture for the new GPUs and it's
gonna be a lovely time so thank you guys
so much for joining us if you happen to
be watching live cheers Jesus if you're
watching in the future cheers to you
guys - but thanks for being here I'm
drinking a Lagunitas Imperial Stout that
cow brought over stay thirsty my friends
tell is drinking what are you drinking
I'm drinking a double IPA from Anderson
down Anderson Valley double IPA
delicious it's delicious stuff we're
gonna continue on my half of the show
with news yeah you know no we're not
gonna
doors buy things for us we have so many
things just about real quick plug for
starts pulsar Burnett is my store I have
quite a few shirts as well as some mugs
pent glasses city's vinyl decals look at
these ladies glasses they're great
high-quality things oh yeah if you buy
them we shout your name at the end of
the show Kyle's store features not just
fidget spinners but also shirts and some
caps now caps yeah I like baseball caps
ends bulk and trucker caps I got it all
caps
I mean wear hats all good shower haps
hats then bye-bye all of them bit with
that tech slash store is Cal store my
stores at Paul's heart Burnett slash
store check them out buy some stuff it's
all real good alright continuing with
news and then tech article seems to be
telling us that these displays that
people have been kind of excited about
from both Asus and Acer are going to be
delayed no yes these HDR displays with
the ACE the Asus one two yeah both so
these displays were first shown off at
comp at CES at the beginning of 2017
we're talking about the Acer 4k HDR
predator X 27 gaming according to a sir
it's been delayed to q1 2018
geez so they're not gonna hit the
holiday season with the launch ASIS in
the same boat with their rog swift PG to
7uq also gonna be delayed to q1 2018 now
if you're familiar with displays and how
the market works generally speaking
there's there's the panel makers the
actual manufacturers of the panels and
then it'll have these companies like
Asus and Acer that take those panels
build a display around it and sell it to
people so both of these displays are
based on an AU Optronics model of panel
it's called the enemy 2 7 and 0 QA n 0
2.2
it's an hv a panel
3840 by 2160 4k resolution 144 hertz
refresh rate and it has direct LED
backlighting with 384 zones which is a
real nice way to do LED backlighting by
the way yeah you can have individual
zones with darkening it's a great like
really good dark scenes and like
that
great for contrast ratio yeah you know
what's not said in this this is the
actual size these are set 27 inch rate
are they like I would think yeah because
it's an X 27 from predator and a PG 227
7 pretty sure this is a 27-inch panel
but it's the 4k the 4444 hertz and HDR
right not HDR all together in the same
panel which is what made these so
desirable yeah cream of the crop they're
also both of g-sync
and there have been no other 4k g-sync
HDR displays announced even so yeah it's
too bad these are delayed where I have
to assume since both of them are delayed
it's got something to do with the
manufacturer of the panel AU Optronics
but hopefully since it is 2018 maybe
it'll be early 2018 maybe maybe a little
see these launch around CES 2018
timeframe or something like that if you
watch my half of the show then maybe you
would know that there's a potential that
you could scale down the resolution of
these displays and potentially increase
the frame rate or I'm sorry the refresh
rate beyond 144 Hertz we were seeing a
480 Hertz display earlier as a prototype
so that's right keep-keep times 27-inch
480 Hertz
HDR yeah super sweet cool with that
moving on I can jump at that space X has
landed another one of its
rockets I usually do a species segment
when I talk about space stuff but I'm
just talking about this specific one
this rocket took off from Cape Canaveral
Florida at 12:30 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time
yesterday it was bound for the ISS the
International Space Station and eight
minutes after takeoff the majority of
the vehicle that being the nine
the main booster itself came back down
and landed on a pad on solid ground off
of the Florida coast this is the 14th
successful rocket landing for SpaceX
it's the sixth time they've landed one
of their Rockets back on the ground
which must be a little bit easier I
think the landing on the barges that
they have floating out on the water
that's pretty pretty benefit of when
they land on the barge floating out in
the water is that they can move the
barge around so they can optimize the
flight path for fuel efficiency and that
kind of thing
but of course the barge is moving around
in water and they have to deal with the
ocean currents and weather and that kind
of thing so landing on the ground is
easier because they have a hundred
percent accurate of attempting to
landing land the Falcon 9 rocket on the
ground the rocket itself carried a
dragon cargo capsule filled with about
6,400 pounds of supplies to scientists
for experiments on the ISS tell about
the crew I imagine resupplies as well
for stuff like you know things to eat
yeah okay that's that's very useful am i
important yeah but yeah the dragon
itself hasn't actually docked with the
ISS yet it will spend the next couple of
days in orbit before meeting up with the
space station on Wednesday so tomorrow
sometime you can follow SpaceX on
Twitter if you want to be updated but
that kind of thing they usually do some
tweets about it and often live streams
of docking procedures and that kind of
thing which is fun to watch this is
their 11th launch this year in 2017
which is already three more than they
did last year and it's only early August
so SpaceX has been ramping up which is
pretty cool nice we get excited about
that stuff because maybe one day SpaceX
will be instrumental in a mission to
Mars
oh yeah that's pretty badass in my on me
up in my opinion alright you're doing a
great job by the way yeah yeah my doing
great job was like just sort of like a
hike man I feel like you got I got you
on the phone perfect service exactly for
the perk
I'm glad the ruse
he's for it alright um I'm just
repeating everything if you are
interested in Android phones and their
capabilities of doing stuff beyond just
being phones you might be interested in
this new development from Qualcomm this
is specifically talking about their new
processor the Neustadt newest snapdragon
processor which isn't specifically named
in the article but they have an image
processing that there's this part of the
processor that does image processing so
I'm trying to say okay it's called
spectra and as part of their next
flagship snack Snapdragon processor
they're doing a bunch of improvements to
spectra such as the ability to do basic
stuff with photography like noise
reduction and vo stabilization but also
support for a bunch more
I'm sorry three more camera modules with
advanced sensing features so as you like
low light and potentially better for
like just like high motion high activity
well there's shots where things are
moving around so this there's three
there's three modules that they're
specifically talking about that do three
different things one does iris scanning
so that's probably pretty huh yeah so do
you guys have already seen that you know
cameras that let you do security
features and everything iris scanning
yeah that's one thing there's also a
module that does depth sensing it's a
uses a passive depth sensor that uses
two cameras with the lenses spaced apart
so it can sense the depth which I
believe is what this chip is showing
right here
but beyond the passive depth sensor
there's also an active depth sensor that
actually uses an infrared illuminator to
shine a bunch of infrared lights down on
the subject and then it uses the
reflection of the pattern to do infrared
sensors Kenny I'm not describing that
very well what why why would someone
need infrared scanning on their phone
because it is more accurate
and it's better determining distortions
in the pattern use it just it determines
its distortions in the pattern of the
dots in order to detect the depth so
that the phone can see not just an image
of what's going on in front of it
but how far away things are okay so
that's that's the main feature here
goldshire yeah determines distortions
and the patterns of the dots can map
depths far more accurately than the
passive system stop that hmm so there
you go and as a result of that I'm sure
there's lots of software and stuff that
can be built on top of this there's tons
of stuff that your phone can do because
of features that the phone has built
into it like a GPS and a camera and a
microphone and a screen and a
touchscreen and lots of other stuff like
that
this is adding more capabilities to the
phone and I'm sure there's lots of
software that might be developed on top
of this to take advantage of it in ways
that we can only imagine right now hmm
maybe there's somebody watching who's
gonna develop an app that will be super
awesome to do with this kind of thing I
hope but phones being able to determine
like the actual distance away things are
in front of them might be something that
could be used for augmented reality well
ma'am you know it'd be useful if it was
like a like a like an active measurement
tool like if you could take a picture of
a desk you know just like if I took it
from this angle and shot a picture of
your desk going this way and it could
actually measure how long or how wide it
is exactly how right yeah I mean
something like that if it's about
calculating depth to some degree it
feels like that would be super useful to
have like an actual tape measure app in
your phone yeah I would love that
and so and so take that base
functionality combine it with other
stuff combine it with other functions
that the phone can do imagine that this
is something that just all phones will
be able to do in a few years next gen
dick pics and yeah stuff that you
already thought your phone it was pretty
cool and was able to do I mean
imagine stuff like through like scanning
scanning something in 3d yeah we're to
be greatly enhanced by something like
this
yeah so 3d scanners like you're pretty
you know pretty expensive and you have
to have a fixed thing that spins the
thing around and scans it or whatever
and I can just there's already basic
levels of functionality but something
like this we do scanning with the phone
I could do it like super accurately or
at least a lot more accurately than
might have been done before so stuff
like that that's presented x' and 3d
exactly and you never get a really a
full appreciation of the curse being
first devices the feature this new
processor from Qualcomm which has this
technology in it is expected to ship in
2018 sometime in 2018
there we go that's all for the basic
news segments let's move on to oh joy Oh
Jojo Joy's sarcastic oh joy is actually
terrible things terrible things with no
solution to them so there we go hold on
let me close some of these oh joy it's
definitely a nice pick me up in the
middle of the show it is it's great
timing for this service Nvidia and
videos next-generation GPU architecture
is codenamed Volta right now we're using
Pascal based GPUs if you're on a 10
series graphics card according to Nvidia
like don't expect volta anytime soon oh
this is based on a transcript of
Nvidia's recent q2 2018 earnings call
provided by seeking out alpha and Vidya
does not plan on releasing volta based
GPUs to consumers anytime soon and Vidya
has only already revealed their vault of
e 100 GPU for enterprise and server
markets which is pretty cool and it's
designed to accelerate AI calculations
and deliver insane levels of compute
performance but hey when can we common
folk get our hands on some Volta based
graphics cards not anytime soon
according to this article write
accordingly because they don't need to
roll out any new cards anytime soon yeah
really not a ton of competition at least
be
high-end high-end so that is that is a
theory companies like Nvidia don't tend
to typically come out and be like we're
not giving you volta because AMD sucks
yeah you don't usually like they don't
usually come out and say that directly
so you know it's up to you to assume
that or inferred or whatever but yeah
Jennsen when
Jensen womp womp he said they do not
plan to release volta this holiday
season or for the foreseeable future as
they see their Pascal architecture at
this time is unbeatable
Wow that's pretty ballsy yeah the
specific quote from the article says
bolt up for gaming we haven't announced
anything and all I can say is that our
pipeline is filled with some exciting
new toys for gamers and we have some
really exciting new technology job for
them in the pipeline parenthetically
Prime's like a really fascinating
presentation about GPU about what our
GPS are doing in cars no one cares about
but for the holiday season foreseeable
future I think Pascal is just unbeatable
it's just best thing out there for any
everybody's looking forward to playing
call of duty or destiny to if they don't
if they don't already have one that
should get a pesky see your so you're
saying like you're sort of their glue
they're not gonna cover like a
distinguished company like a video gonna
outright safe
oh and these are really challenging is
at this point but they are going to
status at this time category where we
are unbeatable and if you look at it
well they really only have one
competitor in the market space so they
did have a tweet earlier this week with
thread Ripper true force just like hey
thread Ripper that's a great pair that's
a great combination for the 1080i an AMD
was like yeah yeah yeah yeah
[Laughter]
[Laughter]
the article very you know being being
fair and everything points out that they
could be facing delays for reasons such
as delays in manufacturing yield
problems or some other technical issue
do we know what kind of memory or it
will just be a lack of competition they
doing Jeep GT or 5x and NVIDIA has
Pascal based GPUs already with HBM
memory on on the Pascal with their
workstation stuff right so I think it's
just up to them I think ain't Nvidia
made the choice which in retrospect
looking at it now that Vega has launched
probably the right choice that hvm to
and HBM wasn't as a viable solution for
the commodity market that gaming
graphics cards is and they wouldn't be
able to manufacture enough of them to
meet up with demand and potentially also
that the benefits of HBM to memory as
far as increased bandwidth just wasn't
gonna make that much of an impact when
paired with but the curt with what the
abilities of the current GPUs that they
can produce so right it seems like they
made a right choice and in that regard
but yet we might see something volta
based with HBM to memory from Nvidia in
the future but really hard to say if
that would be a gaming graphics card or
something else and at the enterprise
market sorry about the dogs they're just
letting us know that it's nighttime are
you sure the Sun has fallen again you
sure you have like a pizza or something
I mean pizza wouldn't be terrible but I
wouldn't complain my wife might be home
at some time yeah alright continuing the
oh joy segments a quick note about the
FCC here an article from ours
Ars Technica the FCC is suggesting via a
document they recently posted that maybe
Americans don't really need fast home
internet service because hey maybe you
got that cell phone data service right
what yes exactly what what so this
document was posted by the FCC it's
backed by a sheet pi who we've talked
about on the show in several different
past episodes this new FCC docs suggest
the changing a specific policy which
regulates mobile broadband service
section 706 of the Telecommunications
Act requires the FCC to determine
whether broadband or more firmly
advanced telecommunications capabilities
are being deployed to all Americans in a
reasonable and timely fashion that's
part of what the FCC is supposed to do
as a government agency that serves the
public they're supposed to look at the
broadband that's out there and be like
hey is this being deployed to people in
a reasonable and timely fashion this new
document is suggesting that reasonable
and timely might mean hey you've got
wireless data service because Wireless
data service can give you internet
connection speeds of about 10 megabits
per second download and one megabit per
second upload that's what the FCC wants
to reclassify your broadband internet
connection as which would mean that the
FCC could then look at the maps that
cover the in the nation as wireless
service oh you've got wireless data your
Verizon map covers you right you've got
your Verizon map coverage at your house
on your cell phone yeah we don't need to
compel your internet service provider to
roll out additional service or actual
hardware to provide you coverage that's
actual wired connection because you've
got the wireless connection they're
lowering the bar they're lowering the
bar for what qualifies as a broadband
connection so the thing so that they can
say that your mobile broadband provider
meets up with that right and that way ah
damnit Ajit that way your mobile data
service has you covered the FCC does not
need to do that job and forced ISPs to
roll out anymore to spend any of their
hard-earned ISP money to roll that
additional improve so that's super blue
coverage for people out there isn't that
same that was not the same thing it's
not the same thing they're capitalizing
on people's like lack of knowledge of
how this works
yeah current broadband standards in the
u.s. at twenty five megabits per second
down and three megabits per second up
still not the greatest but a heck of a
lot better than 10 down and one up and
also just one of those thresholds yeah
because of the limitations of wireless
software in general or wireless hardware
in general we're lowering that would
allow them to meet that threshold so
we've encouraged you guys many times on
the show to talk to the FCC we're doing
it again this is a document that they've
posted let them know you can do so
directly on the FCC website they they do
have forms open for you to provide
feedback that you think that's yes
because it is if you live somewhere if
you're in a rural area I should have
moved this but if you're in a rural area
and you have crappy wired service like
you have an old copper connection or
something like that or DSL and you've
been waiting to get some kind of
internet service upgrade this is the
last thing you want to hear about yeah
because Internet service providers can
charge more money due to scarcity
because scarcity is like oh we don't
have the bandwidth to provide you
because we didn't spend the money to
feed to lay down a fiber or that kind of
thing anyway so that's kind of BS thing
and it's part of why it's a part of oh
joy this is why it's like it's important
to to share this sort of information and
to kind of I feel like it's sort of our
responsibility to teach people
it's like our friends and family about
the sort of thing like data rates and
bandwidth and because like you can try
to get someone hyped up about you know
net neutrality but they don't understand
like bandwidth rates or you know like
the technical aspect of it then they
don't really get the whole concept
look boys - essential details it takes a
while of talking about and discussing
things like make megabytes and gigabytes
and it skill and you know the difference
between bits and bytes yes I mean that
into your head of like what bandwidth is
exactly how it's discussed throughput
versus like raw numbers and that kind of
thing yeah it's it's challenging but
it's the type of thing that people don't
understand right away but it is
definitely the type of thing that the
FCC is trying to take advantage of being
psychic knowledge exactly so they can
change this so that is P is suddenly
like oh we can sit back not spend any
money and charge people more for their
shitty bandwidth yeah that sounds great
okay let's move on to our last story in
oh joy an update this past week if you
had a smartlock might have screwed you
over
ooh the manufacturer is called lockstate
they pushed a firmware update to
hundreds of their internet-connected
lots locks and those locks then became
inoperable Internet of posted about
this I might start doing a regular
segments I follow them a Twitter it's
pretty it's pretty phat it's pretty
fabulous sometimes it's gonna be
fascinating but lockstate mistakenly
sent out the 6i lakh model firmware to
their 7i lock models oh my god was that
the technical reason for why that
happens but just an example of like
lucky derp we're moving to the next
phase of whatever and we have internet
connected locked isn't all about David's
and Doug's Brender all of your locks yes
and now she can't guarantee we're locked
out so that guy sucks the company offer
it affected companies affected customers
what
two options either return the back
portion of the lock to lock state so the
firmware can be updated manually with a
turnaround time of five to seven days or
request a replacement interior lock with
the turnaround time of 14 to 18 days in
the meantime you can still use an actual
key so that's good thank God
that's a thank God for analog that's
good doesn't just save the day still
we're super clutch that is I can just
imagine people like you lockstate
gotta have tweeting from my porch does
that backwards compatibility you know
we're there whatever the tech about like
we're gonna move to the next version
we're gonna like other stuff we're not
gonna support that stuff anymore yeah
when you stop supporting analog yeah
it's not let's try not to do that yeah
you need a backup plan when digital I
can't go anywhere all right let's move
on to the final structured somewhat
segments rate they show which is Las
Vegas Las Vegas mainly what's another
excuse to use my lower third said I made
Las Vegas like Vegas one of the better
or lower thirds we've done it's kind of
fun guys so we're gonna talk a little
bit about saying yeah we already talked
a little bit about big on cows after the
show Vega actually launched yesterday
morning and be like there's been like it
since several years yeah Oh crazy Wow
anyway though there's been lots of
reviews they were they were all over the
place yeah Vega everywhere Vega is a
mixed bag when you look at it directly
but we're gonna marinate we're gonna go
over a few of the results from the
reviews this first one we're looking at
is from PC perspective and of course
these are all linked in the video
description down below yep PC
perspective got their hands on the Vegas
64 the 64 liquid and the Vegas 56 hmm
there they are all next to their
frontier editions and everything like
that they did a crap-ton to testing they
actually 175 grafts in this entire thing
so again guys these are all linked in
the description down below so check them
out if you're really interested in some
more detailed in-depth vaga coverage as
well as full charts can
carrying like the Vega 64's and the 56
is to other cards and their frequencies
and all that good stuff I'm gonna I'm
gonna jump ahead wait do it wait wait
jump around Wow Ryan Ryan this first
page is really long
you got fan spin again let's go let's
look at some results let's look at GTA 5
e anyone from Indies watching another
that good GTA 5 GTA 5 was universally
not good performance with Vega for me
like I mean it's not like a terrible
performance like it couldn't perform but
like just significantly lower favored
favorited yeah for sure it's correct x11
of course but the Vega cards in this one
are the orange line and the green line
and you can see those are the lower
lines here when you compare them to the
upper lines which are the 1080 and of
course the 1080i which is way up there
but yeah GTA 5 the Vega was was that
pasted in I mean Cal you you've done
some benchmarks now yeah you've tested
both cards right yeah what do you think
I mean I feel like it really just
depends I feel like that like Vega 56
I've done more testing with Vega 56
believe it or not than I had a vague 64
I feel like that's the car that most
people are keeping their eye on because
it's a just a bit more attractive of a
price point it's it's a tad more
accessible so I've found that the like
Vega 56 and the gtx 1070 trade blows
often almost to the point where like i
did my my redo lend my redux or whatever
benchmarks today and I found that the
gtx 1070 performed well like less than
1% better on average than vega 56 and
that was manually overclocking both
cards but i felt like it was is more or
less of washing my eyes because the the
cards were trading blows like left and
right so it really just depends on a
number of factors what game you're
playing if that game's DirectX 11
director stole what API are using what
CPU using with its I mean there's so
many variables that that you could
easily skew any results to be like in
favor of Vega 56 or in the GTX 1070 and
I think what it boils down to at this
point is price we don't really know it's
too early to tell and gamers next to
sort of commented on this as well or
they don't really know exactly where
Vega stands at this point because the
pricing is still so up in the air
obviously with the the fact that it's
gone completely out of stock and we're
still waiting for the Adhan board
partner variants to come around we don't
really know we can't give a full
response but what we know right now is
at least for Vega 56 it stays pretty
competitive performance wise with the
gtx 1070 and we're gonna have to wait on
some more pricing details to really
determine whether or not it's a it's a
better buy so yeah yeah I mean I agree
vega 56 at 400 bucks is something that
you could you can have an argument with
someone about yeah whether they should
get the 1070 or the Vega 56 definitely
if someone was like hey I've got let's
say eight hundred bucks to spend I've
already got a you know an okay computer
I want a new graphics card and I want to
get in on this variable refresh rate
thing I want I want some some some vsync
or some g-sync I'm sorry I want some
g-sync or some free sync in my life then
you could very easily say oh well yeah
you should obviously go for Megan 56
yeah because you're gonna spend 400
bucks on the graphics card you can get a
very decent free sync monitor for 400
bucks and you're off to the races now if
someone isn't in that monitor equation
when they're looking for a monitor then
maybe the the conversation changes if
someone is in a situation where they're
like you know what efficiency is really
important to me you know my electricity
costs are already really really always
really high and that kind of thing that
changes the conference
a little bit but the fact that you can
you can say - you know even even even
you know 25 percent of people like this
is the card that you want to get I think
is significant because prior to now at
the $400 price range it was just like
you really get a 1070 yeah
which 1071 pay yeah you know yeah yeah
so yeah that and and the precinct thing
I think I think is makes it something
that should be seriously considered the
mega64
like is harder to as a harder sell for
sure yeah like I think so too because
the performance is the performance gap
between Vega 56 I'm sorry Vega 64 and
the GTX 1080 is quite a bit whiter I
would say in my testing then they get 56
and the GTX 1070 um but you can find a
GTX 1084 not a whole lot more than an
air-cooled reference rx Vega 64 so like
I said in my previous videos like the
relationship between Vega 56 and the
1080 is completely different than that
of the Vega 50 I'm sorry Vega 64 and
1080 it's completely different than Vega
36 and the 1070 I think it's gonna boil
down to the monitor I feel like a lot of
people who are really wanting adaptive
refresh rate in their lives and they
want to get on that bandwagon if if the
price of a free sync monitor is going to
be less than what they would pay for a
juicing panel and that's going to offset
what they would spend overall on an AMD
setup then I think there is a case for
Vega 64 but if you already have a
display or you're not interested in
adaptive refresh rate then overall the
GT 610 ad according to my tests offers
the better value overall frames per
dollar bang for the buck whatever you
want to call it it's pretty fast card
and I've seen a few people in chat say
precinct shouldn't be shouldn't be the
deciding factor and I firmly know and
you're right leads Anish there's a lot
of people who is that really factored in
at all no not at all and it is somewhat
disappointing that in order to make a
case for some of these GPUs you have you
say that route exactly because they get
was so anticipated for so long right so
I mentioned a little bit on Cal's half
of the show that I spent a significant
amount of time in the past 48 hours
going back over my history of YouTube
videos and updating the description
because I was violating an Amazon
affiliate code that jerusem servicing
and I had to remove a bunch of links
that were there I have to you that too
tomorrow and I was going through the
same thing tomorrow and I was going back
historically and I was like when did we
start talking about Vega and it's just
so long ago it was this was well over a
year ago right I'm like man that really
has been a long yeah
wait for launch you know me like alright
there's been so we're gonna be here by
the end of the first half of 2017 yeah
and then I got here's a little mag
here's frontier Edition for fifteen
hundred dollars or whatever for for
workstations I got two more months
alright so yeah the Vega launch I think
if you compare it especially to
something like a thread Ripper launch
has been a little bit of a letdown
sure but that's not to say that it is a
hundred percent failure I would I
wouldn't I want to call that call it
that by any stretch but I think a lot of
its going to depend on availability over
the next few weeks and especially
leading up to like Black Friday time
period when lots of people are looking
to buy stuff whether or not they can
keep it in stock and whether or not like
we sort of briefly discussed on your
half of the show is gonna be any Chindit
changes to MSRP I don't think there is
going to be but you might just see it
not be available directly from any you
know new egg stock that's just always
gonna be gone yeah and the offers you're
gonna see you're always gonna be
third-party sellers who are selling the
wings the $400 bag at fifty six for six
or seven hundred dollars or something
like that yeah that might just be what
happens yep but we'll see yeah anyway a
couple more reviews to your gamers Nexus
I tried to pull some reviews from from
people who I think do a pretty good job
at reviewing I like reading gamers Nexus
reviews because I just feel like a lot
of times they're their unique content
their get-go like from the beginning how
we're gonna take a look at this card is
different like the first chart they show
you is Vega 56 running it four different
power states with various different
memory configurations set up bacon 56
reference stock showing this Vega 56
with 50% power increased only which does
a huge jump up yeah anyone who's getting
a Vega 56 or a Vega 64 this is the power
limits yeah just go just go into the
Radeon settings boom and change your
power slider to 50% I noticed that and
that's a huge leap in performance yeah
beyond that they're testing actual
frequency over clocks and then actual
memory over clocks they also found that
the HBM to memory over clocks were
providing just as much if not more of a
increase in performance as they
frequency over clocks so that's gonna be
another thing to take a closer look at
there's also another thing that I
noticed in the hardware info 64
monitoring utility was it has a GPU and
the HBM memory freak temperature is both
right there and the HBM to memory
temperature with the HBM to overclocked
getting hotter than the the core core
temp which made me think like hmm maybe
I need to start monitoring the HBM to
temps as well hmm but beyond that one
other video if you guys haven't checked
that already I highly recommend you
order box hardware unboxed Steve I like
Steve Steve somehow got his his Vega 56
like in 36 hours he tested 25 games and
made this video on it lights I hate him
I hate him he must have like a band of
monkeys or at least 20 armed terrible
person to do all these benchmarks no
he's he's brilliant he's got a he's got
some excel tricks that I want to
actually do the benchmark Kings but
Steve tested this I'm finished I'm sorry
Vega 56 on 25 different games his tests
show it again like lots of us have shown
Vega 56 and the GTX 970 kind of going
back and forth trading blows he didn't
do overclocking with this so bear that
in mind as well but some some excellent
performance numbers there and Steve
talks you through them as well so check
that video out if you guys are
interested it's linked in the
description of this video it's gonna be
on that's that's about all I had to say
about that cool exciting stuff it's
great it's great to just look at all the
reviews and benchmarks and Jeff that's
that's my I'm phoning in but phoning in
hardcore right now Paul that's fine all
I can think about the dinner feast that
wifey sauce is prepared for me when I
get home
that's kind of exciting I think my wife
brought something home I get I can't
quite see what it is there something in
a bag chicken I'm down for some chicken
a bunch of drugs alright let's do some
Q&amp;amp;A
let's Q&amp;amp;A in the show hey donation with
the Q's and a Steven hill for the 15
bucks spreading the financial love keep
up the work guys try and fit some gaming
in with the work you know we try we try
it's tough you know we gain when we
benchmark I've gotten really good at the
first level of battlefield one yeah I
never really I never got battlefield one
so I haven't benchmarked it yeah I don't
know I just never did I don't know why I
pressed should I mean it's one of those
benchmarks a lot of people expect it's
very good for CPU testing and stuff
we'll say Jonathan Cruz $5 I got a 95
6600 K and a GTX 970 I only do 1080p
gaming but I don't know if I should wait
for coffee lake for the i7 and Volta and
get 220 ATT eyes to make a new PC and
you're fine entirely up to you but I
think for a 1080p gaming you're fine a
6600 K and a GTX 970 is vimes gaming I
was gonna play with those same specs at
1440p so yeah you're good automatic man
if you've got money falling out of your
butt then maybe consider swapping at 970
for a 10 series card but you're fine hi
Bank man thank you the automatic
donation hey cow can I have a super
motivational Asian message to get me
through personal physical training oh
man now I feel I can actually make up a
message for you like a automatic Matt
you don't need to worry you don't need
to worry about your personal physical
training you have to you have the big
Cocker and the bigger master to get
through it all you have amber for
motivation you better than the the other
stupid hmm
the white paper white people are weak
and fever
they ought to know the wood has a secret
Asian secret that we all really
reven said about half ancient Chinese
secret
do you very well you the fat ancestor
that we all work a forward to I pray to
you every day every day I kissed your
feet on the cheek of your feet and make
a special special sacrifice compiled ram
chicken all right yeah you get the point
good lucky automatic master all of your
and all of your training I'd say I'd say
Matt got his money's worth there El Jefe
reviews $5 Cal murd my wife's name ended
the episode that stay positive service
is coming to an FA and but I'm I don't I
don't got him at all I'm sure I put your
dreams in this episode so we can say El
Jefe over and over again we're pretty
confident with that one Homs
Brendan misses with fifty Norwegian
Crona finally back to live watching
what's your thoughts about liquid metal
for CPU and GPU instead of thermal paste
liquid oh whoa I've never tried it I
haven't like done an extensive amount of
testing with that or something something
liquid metal to me is one of those
things it's like a premium product that
typically costs a lot more yeah it can't
improve temperatures ever so slightly
but it's just one of those niche things
that I feel like makes a lot more sense
for people who are going for world
record over clocks and that kind of
thing than people who are like I really
wanted 24/7 overclock or whatever I like
the amount of extra performance you get
for the cost of the liquid metal Tim is
yeah but yeah this is totally anecdotal
so I could be wrong true but I like to
qualify things I say at the end of
awesome hardware episode after every me
a lot in it I feel like for the most
part just regular ngon liquid metal
thermal interface material thermal
compound is going to be sufficient for
most people's needs unless you're doing
some really high end or like extreme
overclocking and you don't want to
dabble into ln2 because it's not
sustainable for 24/7 use then maybe but
if you're if you're just doing a normal
overclock like anyone else I think I
think you don't need you just you just
as long as you're below t.j.maxx
you're it's really anything that's gonna
be good TJ did you realize there's a
jingle for TJ Maxx whenever you did I
didn't but now I do
and now forever you ever seen in local
TV like in the 80s probably not I was
like a baby in the automatic Matt five
dollar donation when do you guys think
the next-gen of GPUs will launch trying
to plan ahead for post BCT celebration
well we never never never Voltas never
coming there we will launch Volta
whizzing Pascal sucks and Pascal doesn't
suck so you don't get Volta no I don't
know Matt I hope I hope sooner rather
than later but I don't expect any time
this year I don't see NVIDIA having the
need to do that ya know a hard one boxed
high in chat they suggested that people
use a thermal Grizzly conductance or
conductive not okay I've never used but
I trust them trust them wholeheartedly
with my life it sounds like a Steve got
something you can only get on Australia
or something thermo grizzly it's like
the one leg up that Australia has on the
rest of the world
grizzly cats on this how does it
feel like a butchering like you in a
baby it's all blurry accidents awful all
right uh-huh automatic Matt again
automatic modern five more dollars
shoutout to right connect for the
helpful info on the army whoo we'd love
helpful army information indeed Jonathan
Cruz five dollars by the way from my
question I plan on getting three ROG
1440p 165 Hertz IPS monitors that's why
I'm thinking of waiting
get to 20 atti that makes a lot more
sense
thank you for explaining that job in the
blanks very very crucial it's changed
their opinion if yep get get two of
those 20 ATT eyes for sure I agree tax
or x95 excellent what does a good
computer case needs to have room for
water cooling turn the bus preferably
white where it gets tricky is I want one
where I can flip the motherboard tray so
window is on the right ah I have the
perfect idea just I think if that guy
should be able to say oh well yeah this
friend has that exact configuration do
you know yes of course not of course
there no I was gonna say the dark base
900 in white from be quite oh I think
that cable they did a limited number of
white version it isn't even out yet
yes it's not even out yet I can't say
the release date it's coming soon but if
you're willing to spend the amount to
whatever they're charging for it's a
really good case it's a really great
case regardless of the call you get it
if you a large it's gonna be hard
anyways it's super large and I believe
you can flip the motherboard and stuff I
think you can the whole orientation I
think that was one of the main features
so did I do that
and it's got a beautiful tempered-glass
site Palin so look into that honestly
that's the only one I know it though so
sorry I can't help with all of those
things yeah that's very specific
good question of mb 67 $20 here's a
little something from Temecula wine
tastings with mrs. Palmer thank you or
67 are you guys going wine tasting in
Temecula we just we did we just did in
the vlog that we posted she nodded and
said thank you as well thank you and b6
yeah yeah
to make you look great it is it's a
great it's local it is you have to
embrace some varietals that aren't quite
as well known though because the bridles
that thrive in Temecula aren't exactly
your like garden variety Merlot Wow well
aren't you the distinguished
wine oh look at you yes I am you know
there's you know there's also a ballast
point in Temecula really there's a
ballast point brewery in particular they
have a place for you
Fuli they have a kitchen and I don't
sort of think we should go that next
time it's the perfect thing to do right
after you go wine tasting David Cho dhf
I don't you heard them when you realize
that a woman you were talking two weeks
ago was flirting and you would've gotten
her move damn it power I spoke ooh top
third the V child
David child sorry I have to see this man
hey I don't know it's all about that
like the awareness you have to be in the
moment at the time and yeah what's going
on yeah yeah but yeah sometimes you
don't see it till later and that's
always said you gotta hand it to like
super douchebags who were just somehow
miraculously amazing with women it's
like that's like the like God put you on
this earth just for that reason cuz you
suck at everything else but good lord I
could never talk to a woman like that
again keep keep your eyes up in thievery
and maybe there'll be a second chance
yeah oh my Jesus okay well we'll get
around to that donation I did not see
that right now uh Thomas look ins $5
ecigs can be had for 300 bucks with 2x
fifty-five 70s or the two series are
even cheaper on eBay up to 3 plus
gigahertz seems good for work flow on
the cheap and gaming z6 hundreds so
that's I would I would I would be fine
with that as workflow options he's
talking about the Xeon the Xeon stuff
we're talking about earlier okay with
dual 55 seventies so I'd be curious is
with that as far as workflow options for
something that was heavily
multi-threaded like doing video editing
or something like that or other
workstation tasks I'd be curious as far
as the gaming performance because gaming
typically loves clock speed and Zeon's
are not typically known for that and
also usually can't be overclocked or at
all from my knowledge so I'd be curious
about the gaming performance but that
would be an interesting thing to look
into yeah you need that
Thank You Thomas thank you notice tomas
coos allison $20 i so have
been drinking been meetings donate since
Paul said Tycho was his favorite band
me too everyone go raid awake by Tycho
thank you both for the show stay awesome
yep psychos oh that's hectic the best
yeah thank you very much listening to
take oh right before Cal get here yep
there the great for building building
music remember I'm sitting there and I'm
like doing something and I'm like I'm
inefficient and I suck and then I put on
Tyco and then I'm like I'm just doing
things now yep anything's happened it's
awesome great for chillin here for
working out that way for LSD all right
Jeremy Mikkola
$20 I've read that an O seed 1,800 X
puts out 110 plus watts of heat do you
think it tastes like an s 340 or P 400
would be a good pairing or would they
struggle with thermals both of those
cases as long as they're properly
equipped with case fans and some he says
Super Mario if you have an AI oh you're
fine yeah you're totally good man it has
to be 40 is prank I feel like both of
those cases are practically built for AI
o units and remember that there's like a
lot of air coolers of three four or five
years ago
we're rated for 140 to 180 watts yeah
110 watts isn't that insane as far as
heat dissipation goes we're getting much
liquid you're totally good and as far as
case goes there's lots of cases with
lots of different configurations add
more fins if you're concerned about her
flow add more fins yep and absolutely
unless so we've got one from dr. B 19
$10 Paul it's driving me crazy I know
what a weeping angel is but what is that
other the other character on that
t-shirt you wear oh I was waiting in
yesterday's those of you yeah it's boo
it's Mario it's a ghost from Super Mario
Brothers yep and he and it's the same
it's the same sort of thing because any
time you look at boo he freezes but as
soon as you look away he comes towards
you yeah it's the same sort of thing
with the weeping angel correct yes more
or less I'm not so precise they're
looking at each other both of them have
to be frozen covered so they're both
frozen that
theoretically there's ways you could
talk about that and like the game theory
different base their motive it's a
weeping angel and a boo it's one of
those crossover shirts yet beautiful all
right
Enrique de la Garza for the $5 I already
own a gtx 1070 should i invest in a
1080i for a new ultra wide set up or buy
a second 1070 to do sli 1080i yep i go
all the way ago for the single today's
less heat less power just as much
performance if not so if not more so
than depending on the game and stuff but
usually a single faster GPU is going to
dominate the gtx or dominate a multi-gpu
set especially because every game is
optimized to run one GPU not all games
are optimized for multi-gpu
configurations yes so bear that in mind
less heat less power more support go for
the 1080i man you limping $11.99 next
six pack on me you got it that's a
premium six pack for a living
ninety-nine as hell yeah gonna get some
sculpin Gerar like that drawled from a
$10.60 should I saw my GTX 1066 ski you
might to a minor and purchase a minor
minor like cryptocurrency minor not like
under 18 and purchase of a get 56 to go
with my free sync monitor also I tweeted
you my PC part pick the link to my raggy
both are bear very busy but criticism is
appreciated Cheers
alright so the GT is 10 seconds 16 it
depending on how much you can sell it to
that minor to purchase Vega 56 would be
an upgrade if you can swing it I would
try to get if you can buy the Vega 56
first yeah like get yourself your Vega
56 and then sell your 1066 gig yeah
don't don't tell you don't sell your
1066 UEFA's you might not be able to get
big if it yeah because Vega 56 might be
a pipe dream at 400 bucks indeed it's
it's still yet to be determined fully
yeah but yeah if you can do that then I
would say yes for a free sync monitor
you know it's gonna be a nice upgrade
documents you will actually be able to
use it versus with 1060 yep Maxwell
Marin
do you think the workstation benchmarks
by tech Gamescom would justified Vega 56
or 64 for pro users not gamers I am not
familiar with tech gauge calm in their
benchmarks hey I did look very
specifically at those but some of the
benchmarks on Vega 64 and 6 Bega 64-56
have been focused on workstation stuff
and actually it's pretty good at that
in fact same sort DNA as the Omega seems
to outperform Nvidia equivalent with
workstation stuff so might be something
that's viable for you max well again I
don't want to say yes do this or no
don't do that because I really haven't
fully looked at that article it was very
it was a quick glance earlier today
maybe give it another week or so and
there's there's lots of tests that
already happens there's lots more tests
going on right now people are gonna
still be posting stuff give it give it a
little time to see how things play out
see if you can see specific benchmarks
run on your workstation applications and
I'll give you a better idea of what to
expect deep next house wife Heather head
of there the ten dollars Wow okay Paul
enjoy my donation for hosting there also
please ask Kyle when he will be home for
dinner I'm hungry these donations are
fun from the super awesome wifey sauce
Cal will be home when the donations
finished and they keep rolling in yeah
never I'll be home when you stop
trolling me on stream woman and you're
damn right dinner dinner battery reddit
when I walk in those doors no I like
we're almost done Ramos tonight turned
into a redneck castle when I talk to my
wife by my bits five dollars if you had
to choose between tacos or pizza for the
rest of your life as the only food you
could eat which one oh pizza
I think tacos Bacchus pizza pizza is
delicious tacos has a bit more nutrition
in it
maybe just a little bit like you got you
got you know some lettuce tomato yeah I
haven't got tacos tacos they're more
flexible food they are but by minutes
I've watched several of your
flex videos recently actually Miguel
Rubio $10 going to quakecon nobody could
ever even do a quick con I'm sorry it's
just too many things that I want to I'm
just so tired right I know he's looking
for a week where I have minimal things
planned where Paul and I are will be
attending sleep con this year exactly
every day
Logan C $10 Paul how about more lawn
vids no Logan come on one thing I'll do
videos where I'm building stuff and I'm
planning to build more stuff once things
stop launching but then you could have
like nori like prancing around your
grass you could you be like get off
there will be more like like Paul's
hardware vlogs and or a garage were
clogs I probably won't focus much more
than on lawn mowing though it was it was
fascinating one else I feel I can only
get away with one of those dry world
Jerald my bucket Ellis who would win in
a fight between the grilled cheese in
the taco again with the tacos Hawk hot
rod fans anyone Bueller grilled cheese
on the taco
I think the taco would win taco just
seems mean and like you know especially
if it's a hard shell okay probably has a
rough exterior I agree grilled cheese
seems a little little spineless and
confused about the hot rod question of
instance no I'm not
Thank You gerald I've currently got a
GTX 970 overclocked to 1.8 gigahertz how
long should I wait before considering an
upgrade twist to 1070 1080 or Vega
I like the 970m you if you're gaming at
1080 and even even if you're in 1440
wait for the next generation wait for
2000 series whatever comes next
at this point it's only a year away
Jetix with pyro heroes best processor to
pair with the gtx 1080i for 4k gaming
only I would probably not settle for
less 7700
okay or you know like a high-end desktop
platform chip but obviously that's not
going to be quite as good for gaming for
the most realistic flame rings you want
a 77 okay that's overclocked to 5
gigahertz or so or for 77 40k that's
also overclocked but that's really
impractical as far as how much money you
have to spend exactly so yeah
77 American yep last last donation here
of the night Sebastian Casilla for the 8
ee Argentinian something I found a
Corsair h-60 100 bucks but people tell
me in some forums that isn't worth the
money and should stay with air for my
7700 K nice show as always I don't think
it is either h-60 should cost much less
than 6 50 60 bucks just get get a 240
millimeter a io 4 years 7700 K so you
can overclock it to 5 gigahertz like
Paul said really get the most out of it
that's one of those few chips that gets
hot enough to really warrant spending
the extra premium on a 240 millimeter a
IO you will be happy that you did it
you'll be able to overclock it as much
as you want and squeeze the most
performance out of that chip if you are
gonna go air cooling get it and get a
nice beefy air cooler that performs well
maybe a Noctua or a be quiet cooler
something something substantial that's
going to be able to handle the the TVP
on that guy and the the heat output that
it exhibits but for the most part a chip
Seifer 100 is not a good deal okay uh
