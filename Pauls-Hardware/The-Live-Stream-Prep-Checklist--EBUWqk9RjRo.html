the events that I'm preparing for today
the charity livestream that I'm doing
with Kyle is probably already gonna be
over
hopefully it was successful hopefully we
raised lots of money for local
children's hospitals but this video is
actually going to be about setting up
for that events and not about me and
shaving my beard off because my periods
probably gone by now too
I'm getting distracted though what this
video is actually about is setting up
for a live stream and my checklist of
what things I need to take care of
before we're ready to go so if you've
never done a live stream before they can
be lots of fun but you're pretty
distracted while you're actually
live-streaming so getting everything set
up beforehand can be very important and
you'll definitely think yourself and
won't be distracted from actually gaming
and interacting with the audience while
you take care of everything else let's
just run down the list first off we got
to establish our game plan that's
already mostly taken care of you know
clean up set up our streaming area out
here set up the PC hardware set up the
software and games we will be playing
and using I have an extras option right
here too because I haven't all got to
stream deck and stream deck mini which I
might integrate but I need to set up the
software and everything so that's kind
of a stretch goal but we also want to
set up snacks foods and drinks since
we're gonna be going for 12 hours and
then lastly we want to set up a test
stream and maybe actually practice the
video games you're gonna play so that I
don't suck or at least maybe suck less
so item number one is to establish game
plan and fortunately we've already been
working on that we're gonna be gaming
and streaming for 12 hours straight from
10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Pacific time on
December 8th which is in the past so
know why I'm telling you guys about that
but Kyle and I are both gonna be
streaming and we're gonna be streaming
to our twitch channels and then also
probably to our YouTube channels at the
same time so we need to make sure we're
set up to double stream to both of those
then we also have a third channel which
is our awesome hardware twitch channel
which we always stream to every Tuesday
evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific we're gonna
use that as sort of a master stream
where you can look at both of the
gameplay streams from either of us but
then also have centralized chat and
audio editor Joe is also gonna be here
so he's gonna be on a third system than
my main streaming and capture system
over there and then finally of course
you don't need to do a charity
livestream when you're live streaming
but it's nice to raise money for charity
if you can so we have two systems that
we are going to begin
way as well right here and then kayo
will be giving away a third system so we
can mark that one off the list and move
on to clean up unfortunately we did a
pretty good job cleaning this area up
just last week and it's still mostly
clean I know it's already starting to
look a little bit cluttered but this is
one of the gaming systems so we're gonna
be using that over here I'm gonna do
some more cleaning and titling just to
make sure everything is shipshape out
here for a lengthy livestream so
everyone is comfortable but then the
other thing I want to make sure I have
cleaned up is an area out here for
guests because we're probably gonna have
a few people stopping by who aren't
necessarily part of the livestream I
want to make sure they can sit down and
be comfortable out there and then of
course cleaning the bathroom anytime you
have guests over you should make sure
you have a clean and usable bathroom so
I'll spray you guys actually all of that
stuff and let's just assume I've cleaned
up and we can move on so here's the
stream area set up we have three
stations going on I'm gonna be there and
they back create with our Panther Cal is
gonna be right here with the fastest
gaming PC ever and he's got a chair
right over here
both of us have 1080 main monitors that
we're gonna be gaming on as well as
secondary monitors so we can set up our
stream stuff the station for the stream
and capture system has been moved to
right over here so Jo's gonna be right
there we'll probably get him a better
seat too and then we still got enough
room to move around I've got some space
for the dog goes over here Hiro is
demonstrating and that means we can mark
off set a stream area so next is to
actually set up the hardware itself so I
still haven't plugged all this stuff in
and I'm gonna explain to you how
everything is actually set up actually
let me get everything plugged in and set
up and then I will explain to you how it
is plugged in and set up but one other
key thing is that we've got three pretty
substantial systems out here one two and
three any of these could easily pull
five six hundred watts plus depending on
what's being done with it and I have
only a single circuit out here so I'm
definitely gonna need to run another
extension cord from back in the house
somewhere at least probably just for
cows computer ok guys some time has gone
by I've made a few changes I decided to
move this can
pewter over to that side just to make
things a little bit more spaced out over
here but PC hardware is now set up for
the most part I think I hope I'm having
one main issue and that is that my razor
ripsaw still is not working properly
with this system over here it just ends
up being extremely choppy and everything
so I'm using my old-school elgato hd60
which is okay for 1080 60 Captur but
does introduce a bit of delay however
since I also have an elgato 4k Pro in
there basically OBS was allowing me to
choose one or the other but not both and
I had finally given up on it and then I
like left it for a second and I came
back and then it was both working so
that's very strange but this right here
is this system and this 1080 monitor and
then this over here is arctic panther
over there and that other 1080 monitor
so let me go over the streaming hardware
setup basically there these are all
intended to be self-contained streaming
setups so arctic panther right here for
monitors we have two 1080 that's the
main gaming one and that one is passed
through the capture system back there
and then back over here so I can
actually game on it secondary monitor
here is for monitoring chat and having
anything else that's necessary up there
while the stream is live and then since
I will be streaming from this system I
have a headset here so that will be my
mic and my headphones Kyle's gonna have
a similar setup here with this system
there's a 1080 monitor right here that
he will game on is the secondary monitor
if it's 4k forchette and everything else
and then this 1080 monitor again is
passing through this system over here so
it can be captured for the main awesome
hardware stream okay I will also have a
headset although he's gonna bring his
own and then he's got a mic the setup
that he's also gonna be bringing the
audio for this system is actually gonna
go out the HDMI to be captured by this
system so it needs to pass through to
this so for that he's gonna plug the
headphones directly into the monitor so
he can hear that and it can also be
captured by the HDMI pass-through
finally of course the main streaming
setup this one Joe is just gonna have
some headphones to where the audio is
actually going to be from the sound
board and for that we have a mic right
there and then a second mic over there
so whatever Joe's saying or whatever
we're saying should all be able to be
picked up and heard by anyone listening
to this stream and then this stream can
show either of the
games that we are playing and then when
Joe has some free time I'm not assuming
he's going to be moderating the entire
time I want him to play games with us
too he can game on this monitor capture
that and actually stream three games at
a time on this and we still have some
setup and configuration to do with that
to make sure we can also so show chat
on-screen and everything but I believe I
am now safely far enough along that I
can check off the setup PC hardware
software and games is next and when it
comes to the games this is my solution I
actually have a couple of these is your
two terabyte crucial mx5 hundreds and
these are gonna be my external game
drives actually what previously was my
external game drive I had a one terabyte
SSD that's actually installed in the
system down there in the bottom so I'm
gonna be copying as many of those games
off of there and onto here so I can set
up this is an external and then I have a
second one as well as another external
USB 3 adapter that I can do the same
thing with so I need to do a lot of game
copying and then of course once the
games are copied I need to actually load
up the game client whether it's the
battle.net client or steam and load up
each actual game on each system and that
way you won't have to wait through first
launch delays tomorrow obviously this is
a transition because Joe's here now and
so is Kyle
but let's where are we as far as this
Chiklis thing I got as far as setup
software in games yesterday which I was
able to do and then I jumped forward to
test stream and practice and then I
stayed up a little bit too late trying
to get better at fortnight's so we can
at least mark that one off now as far as
the stream deck didn't actually get to
that unfortunately so we'll have to save
that for a later video maybe an advanced
livestream video but snacks food and
drinks I took advantage of the fact that
Kyle is coming and Joe is coming
actually mainly just Joe Kyle did bring
God did bring luck beer in McDonald's
which best kind of snacks Joe brought
good snacks too though potato chips
potato chips that's Jenna let's check
our snacks Kyle brought McDonald's and
it's totally not vegan at all and then
from Joe we got some potato chips here
yeah
chips we got some of these chips
actually these these are also tortilla
chips from the family up last week that
are still good and then we
some salsa and we have some salsa con
queso we got some cheese dipping sauce
beautiful snacks are taking care
I mentioned beer - and we got beer got
some soda that is checked off and then
one final bit here now that cows here
and he's got his headset on we're trying
to pipe that through this monitor but
the audio out wasn't working there so we
got one final change to our audio
configuration Kyle still gonna be
playing on this monitor here he's going
to be using the webcam here to stream
his face and then for his headphones I
don't know you can even see this there's
a splitter an audio splitter here so
this is plugged into his headphones gone
over to him and then this other side is
going over into our sound board which is
also where the external mics are coming
in so the sound bar can be used here for
audio on this computer this computer is
restarting so Joe can install the
software for the NIF oh and also get a
monster going guys
Joe do that sponsor pitch for monster
right but guys that's all for this video
I hope you have learned a little bit
more about how the setup process goes
for a crazy multi-part live stream like
this what are you doing you're supposed
to be framed in the shop this is
supposed to be very well framed shut but

video I really hope this livestream goes
well and if you happen to join us and if
you made a donation thank you to you as
well definitely thumbs up button on this
