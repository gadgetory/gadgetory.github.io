hardware i am getting back into the
swing of things today with an unboxing
and an overview in a bit of a review of
this wireless gaming kit that corsair
sent over they were like hey Paul we
have a bunch of new wireless stuff if
you guys checked out my CES 2018
coverage you might have seen a bit of
coverage there they wanted me to take a
look at it directly so they sent me this
big old box I'm gonna take everything
out of here I know we have the k63 where
I list mechanical gaming keyboard in
here and let's see what else they've
included as well yeah of course their
logo we are greeted with oh this is an
actual hold on
nevermind I did it wrong
unboxing fail flipping is not the method
inside we have the k63 of course
Wireless mechanical keyboard made to use
on the couch and also be mechanical we
have the dark core RGB special edition
right here Wireless Gaming Mouse with
RGB of course there void Pro RGB very
nice wireless gaming headset from
Corsair oh look they've included a
little this is the course their survivor
stealth which is just a USB Drive this
is a 32 gig USB 3 one is this stuff so
rounding things out this right here is
the K 63 gaming lap for dand this is
actually made to go with the case 63
gaming so that you can use it on the
couch in a living room
environments so I'm definitely gonna be
testing that out and then we have the mm
1000 right here which is extremely
controversial this is one of the most
expensive gaming mouse mats that you
might ever encounter yourself that
that's because it comes to the cheese
spot and we've already made plenty of
jokes about the cheese spot there but
because the dark core RGB special
edition can do wireless Qi charging you
can take it and park it on the chief
spot and then you can charge it there it
also comes with the dongle adapter and
that kind of thing so we'll get that out
of the box and check it out in just a
second so now a quick look at the retail
box says k6eid Wireless one millisecond
response time when it's connect
via the standard RF wireless function
you can also do Bluetooth connection
with this which is really nice it's
gonna take it on the go and connect it
up to a laptop or something like that
bluetooth response time is a bit slower
it's about 7.5 milliseconds at minimum
probably about more more like 8 but you
also have some cool features here
128-bit AES encryption capable so that's
helpful if you're concerned about
wireless security it can do encryption
within the device now let's get perky
blue LED backlighting on these keys not
our GB and I believe that's just because
if they'd included RGB not only would it
be more complicated on the software side
to control it but it's probably gonna
use more power too so they wanted to
make sure the keyboard would stay
powered and charged for quite a long
time Cherry MX red switches of course
and then let's go ahead and take this
out of the box you're going to control
this keyboards functions with the
Corsair utility engine software the q
software which I have downloaded on the
system right over here so we can at
least take a quick look at that and then
internally we got the keyboard no wire
I'm so used to like taking keyboard out
and you have to fish the wire out of
this part but that's not including a
manual a USB cable a little clip it's an
adapter so you can use the USB cable as
an extension if you want to you get a
wrist rest here's the Wi-Fi adapter as
well alright this dress goes on like so
it's got a bit of rubberized texture on
it for your wrists and then because this
is capable of connecting in multiple
different ways you of course have the
USB cable that's included there as well
now here in the back you actually have
an on/off switch and then there's a USB
port that's actually a mini USB
connector if I was going to begin
critiquing this that would be my first
area of critique these connectors are
not durable so but you're only gonna
need to plug it in while charging so I
guess maybe or maybe not it's a good
choice but I would have preferred USB
type-c but you do get a decent length of
USB cable there and there's an adaptor
that you can plug into the end of it so
you can use that to actually reposition
your
USB receiver so if you want you can take
that and position it somewhere in your
living room or living space if you're
using this on an HTP see where it gets a
better reception for example or if you
have eh TPC tucked away plug that in
right there
or of course unplug that little thing
and just plug that directly into the
keyboard in order to charge it up
keyboard itself is pretty standard
QWERTY layout it is 10 keyless and again
less Keys means it's a little bit more
portable if you're gonna take a wireless
keyboard on-the-go portability is a
factor and then of course without those
extra keys there it means you don't need
lights for those keys which means it's
gonna help hopefully improve battery
life having that not there versus there
now I've really introduced that's
without the power switch switched on the
keyboard won't function that kind of
makes sense actually so if you have the
power switch off and the keyboard
plugged in it will charge and a little
power indicator light here will indicate
that but if you want to use it plugged
in turn it on once it's on you can see
the lights light up and that's nice and
pretty this is off that is 33% and that
is 66% they can go brighter than that
actually it can go up to 100% but by
default in order to conserve battery
life Corsair has kept this at a 66% max
brightness you can go into the Corsair
utility an engine software and adjust
that to get hundred percent brightness
if that's your thing if you have it at
zero percent brightness like this you'll
get about 75 hours of battery life on a
full charge 33 percent brightness to get
about 25 hours and 66 percent brightness
you can get about 15 hours if you do
crank it all the way up to a hundred
you'll get about 10 hours of battery
life even at a high percent brightness
that's still a decent amount of battery
life for most play sessions of course
you'd probably want to plug it in and
charge it after that
beyond that you got some media control
keys up here in the top left as well as
the top right forward back stop all that
good stuff volume up and down as well as
a mute button you don't get the roller
here like you do with some of the other
hand Corsair keyboards so that is a
trade-off there and then of course
Cherry MX switches so if you pull off
the Escape key here you can see the red
Cherry MX which they're they're going to
have this in red out of the gates and
then based on feedback from customers
and if people want them they may also
include other types of choice which is
as well yes some additional functions
you can access via a function
key down there so a home and an
application switch and zoom up here you
also have wireless enable or disable
right here so the 2.4 gigahertz wireless
mode you can access right there or
Bluetooth mode you can turn on and off
also there is a PC sleep function that's
available there as well the wireless LED
indicator is up here and it will
function in different modes if it's
white and solid that means it's
connected and everything's ok
it'll be blue and solid if it's
connected via bluetooth the light will
also blink if it's having any problems
with connectivity and there's some
troubleshooting steps you can take in
the manual to to deal with that also
just discovered in the manual you can
use function + f11 to give yourself an
immediate indication of the current
battery level so right now it's just
flashing green because I'm plugged in
via USB power so if I were to unplug
that we can see these immediately turn
to whites it's flashing lights on the
Wi-Fi connectivity because it's not
connected to anything whites on the
actual power indicator here indicates
that it's it's medium to full charge I'm
gonna set this aside and leave it to
continue charging we'll go ahead and
open up the rest of this stuff I'm gonna
not open the void Pro right now because
that's been out for a little bit and
I've already got one so here's the dark
core RGB special edition Mouse let's
take a quick look at this one so here's
a look at everything in the box with the
dark core RGB couple manuals here for
how to use it and we also have a USB
cable once again micro USB I'd love to
see some USB C on these these came with
the same wireless adapter as well as a
little adapter for the cable so you can
plug it in directly if you want to but
you can pop this little little finger
rest here and add this one on so if you
like a pinky rest or a index finger rest
whatever whatever you want to set there
now this is wireless just like the case
63 of course and it will need its own
little bungle in order to connect so you
are going to be able to connect both of
these at the same time but you'll have
to eat up 2 of your USB ports which is
pretty normal for connecting up a couple
of peripherals but over here again just
like the case 63 we can switch back and
forth between 2.4 gigahertz Wireless
mode and Bluetooth wireless mode via a
switch down here and of course just an
on/off so
so you can turn the mouse itself on or
off you can now also plug in the micro
USB cable right here front and that will
allow you to use this in Wired mode so
again just like k63
then making sure you can use this
wirelessly but if you want to plug it in
if you're low on battery you can do that
and keep playing and you won't have to
wait for it to charge or that that sort
of thing beyond that this is a
relatively new design I would say from
Corsair when it comes to their mice
something that we haven't seen exactly
before of course when it comes to mice
there's not a whole lot of differences
that you can make from one to the other
but up here you got left and right click
you get forward and back that's up here
for your thumb you also have a dpi
switcher rolling mouse wheel and then
over here you have sort of a unique
little thumb pad as well as a
directional pad that's on the side so
you can click in the middle or you can
click on the sides of that pad as well
to go forward or back with your thumb
which can be useful so it's got a bit of
textured grip right here for the palm
rest as well as a little bit down here
where your thumb would rest that's it's
nice to have as well just anecdotally
putting it in my hand right now for the
first time it's pretty comfy now if
you're wondering what makes that dart
core a special edition it is because it
has the Qi charging that's integrated as
well according to Coursera even with the
chief spot on here it charges just as
fast as it does when it's plugged in so
that I thought was was pretty
interesting granted you need a specific
spot on the mousepad in order to charge
it but the fact they're able to get
that's quickness of charging it's pretty
impressive
anyway that's everything that comes in
this box all right so there is your
everything that comes with the mm 1003
three guides I don't know why any more
documentation for this and otherwise but
you get a decently long braided cable
with two plugs on the end so USB two and
a USB three it looks like is why not let
me peel this plastic off real quick top
so guys I've spent a few minutes just
messing around with this to see if I can
make sure everything's working
functionally the mouse appears to be
behaving when we first plugged it in via
the USB it wasn't working but after
installing the courser utility engine
software it does appear to be working so
I've got it set up in Wireless mode
right now
and I've also installed the courser
utility engine software over here so we
can at least give you a quick initial
rundown of sort of how it works I also
got the MM 1000 up and running here to
when I initially plug this in I also
thought it didn't work but that was
because it only really lights up and
does anything when you're using it so
the Qi charger right here you might be
able to tell is lit up green that's
because it's it's not charging anything
but it's detected there and when you
actually put a Qi charging device there
such as the mouse it will detect it
start flashing green and that will let
you know that your device is charging
the mouse will light up white by default
and flash every so often while it's
charging as well now beyond that this
has a pass through a USB 3 pass through
as well so I just plugged in my little
survivor stealth back there to make sure
that was working properly and yes it is
so that gives you just an easily
accessible USB port that's on your
desktop or of course connect that up to
your mouse for example if you or
something else so you might need to
charge there just nice to have that
extra piece there I also mentioned in my
CES coverage is that you come with it
comes a little Qi adapter here so for
any USB charging device you can use this
to charge it with the g-spot and it
comes with the USB micro by default but
it also comes with a little lightning
adapter there for iPhones or a little
type C adapter here so you can use this
to connect if you have a USB type-c
device it's the only type C plug in this
box unfortunately and then of course you
just plug that into your smartphone and
put that above and then it should start
charging yay starting to charge now
practically speaking I don't know how
much more practical this is then say
just taking a USB plug and plugging in
your phone and charging it you're still
plugging something in so perhaps the
viability of the wireless Ness goes out
the window somewhat but the Qi charging
is still pretty fun and I think honestly
you're probably going to mostly be using
it to charge up your mouse it's just a
question of whether it's worth the cost
of this mouse and this mouse pad in
order to get that functionality it's
pretty cool though when it comes to the
software though as you can see over here
the actions sub menu you can add sets of
actions so you
reassign your left click middle click
profile switch and everything that also
it gives you a little indicator of what
each button actually is including that
sniper button in the middle and the
forward and backward rock buttons that
you have on either side beyond that
lighting effects here can also be added
so you can just default it to a rainbow
or of course you can use the more
advanced functions to set up your own
lighting effects dpi modes over here you
can use those to switch between by
assigning DPI switch functions on the
mouse and then you can also do angle
snapping here enhance a point your
precision I usually don't go for those
but if you like them they are available
and then of course you can use the same
software to control or your k63 Wireless
so same sets of functions here you can
set up macros via the actions tab you
can do lighting effects here as much
presets available via this drop down
menu visor rain pulse you can change the
opacity and speed by default and then of
course this advanced button up here you
can always check to get into some more
of the advanced settings which I am NOT
going to get into because that would
take too much time
finally for performance you can set what
wind lock does and a couple other the
specific functions like disabling the
Windows key and wireless encryption if
you don't like the wireless encryption
you can turn it off it does add a very
very small amount of latency but it's
really negligible but of course what
good are wireless peripherals if you
can't sit and play games for hours on
end while you're on the couch in your
living room because that's what wireless
mice and keyboards are made for right
well lots of us use controllers wireless
controllers to a game on the on the
couch but the gaming lat board is an
accessory you can buy this separately
from the k63 or you can buy a package
that comes with both of them together
but it basically is a flat board it's
got some cushioning on the bottom it's
got a flat spot to use your mouse and
it's got a full slot as specifically
designed to hold the k63
it's got a stand-in of this little box
right here includes bezel clips and
those aren't meant to retain the k63 in
place it's got a wrist rest here with
some rubber texture on it it's got a
nice Corsair mouse mat over on this side
no wireless Qi charging
or anything like that but the bottom is
all memory foam cushioning let's say you
can actually set it on your lap make it
nice and comfy it's a little bit
breathable there as well so in order to
install are just gonna remove the
existing wrist rest crappy wrist dress
that it came with I'll pop it up here
wraps it down
snaps into place hey that was pretty
simple it is held in at the top just by
these little plastic tabs it rotates so
it's got a little knot a couple notches
and just snap in like so and that holds
our pretty securely actually these are
just little plastic tabs so basically if
these ever snap off if you're you know
removing it and putting it back on these
are just replacements so you can snap
them in there these pieces are actually
for the bottom here so if these little
catches ever snap off you've at least
got a few replacements you can remove
these bottom ones with a Phillips head
screw down there and pop those back in
in case you have breakage happening
that's it I think it is about time for a
play test and I just happened to have a
living room with an HTP see still in the
works so let's go ahead and give this a
shout out thing alright guys so I've
been doing a bit of play testing with
this setup out here in the living room
and I will say it's pretty functional
it's did a pretty good job most of the
time if I'm gonna play video games in
the living room I'm gonna use something
like this Xbox 360 controller just
because it's a little bit more conducive
to the living room gameplay experience
it's a bit more reminiscent of your
console gaming and this does the job for
a decent amount of games i've been
playing Final Fantasies 10 out here for
the past couple weeks
it does a good job but it's not like
Universal there's lots of games that are
designed to be played with a mouse and
keyboard so the first game I tried that
was doom doom was actually designed to
be played with the mouse and keyboard
not a controller so that's a great
example of a game that you really would
need a setup similar to this in order to
play with now I will say that while the
response time just anecdotally seems to
be pretty fast there is a tiny tiny bit
of delay and I mainly notice this when I
first actually got the mouse connected
and just moving the mouse around in the
operating system a little bit it's just
a tiny tiny bit
delay and it gives you that slight
floatiness feeling but once I actually
got into doom actually found that that
kind of went away just because the more
the fluidity of the gameplay sort of
took over a little bit more moving
around just seemed a little bit more
natural oh god you're not gonna play as
precise of aiming as you would with the
typical desktop setup where you have a
wired mouse that has no latency when it
comes to response time or that kind of
thing but it got the job done and I got
through a couple levels and it's
definitely easily passable and probably
wouldn't even notice that delay if
you're more used to playing in a living
room environment or with wireless
peripherals it's only the comparison to
the direct connected wired peripherals
like you'd have on a desktop PC that
you're really seeing any sort of
fallback now compare that to the next
game I pulled up which was sip 6 and
this is one of my favorite games and
definitely a game that you could easily
play in the living room because it's
turn-based it's not quite as fast paced
and you don't necessarily need to be as
accurate with your mouse as you're
moving it around in order to point on
things and click on things it's not
quite like aiming to get a headshot in
an FPS game so here I just loaded up a
quick game playing this China and again
just one of those experiences where it's
a difference but Pleasant when it comes
to playing out in the living room on a
big 4k 65 inch TV as compared to sitting
at a desk and whereas both sides
definitely have their advantages it's
really nice to be able just sit down in
the living room and play on the HDTV see
speak of the HTTP see yes I will still
be working on that and bring you guys
more updates on that very soon and I
will say as far as being comfortable
because that's obviously a big feature
of like the lap board aspect it's it's
comfortable comfortably on the knees and
I would imagine to be able to play here
for a while not quite as long as like
sitting at a desktop because I think
economics start to slide a little bit
like if you're gonna lean back and play
like this so that kind of thing it's
functional but you're just that you're
probably going to start to introduce a
little bit more wrist strain because of
the angles you're at and that kind of
thing but so you probably won't be able
to play for quite as long as the gaming
session as you would at a desk where you
have a little bit better economics where
you're sitting up straight with your
arms at the right angles and everything
there but it's comfortable enough and
definitely the combination of the k63
lab board and the dart core se makes a
great solution for giving you the
Premium gaming feel like with the
mechanical keyboard and like a nicer
gaming mouse as compared to say other
solutions like I don't know does this
count all that said my first impressions
are good this is definitely a very
viable solution for gaming in the living
room so thumbs up alright guys that is
going to wrap it up for this video on
Corsairs new set of wireless gaming
peripherals the k63 wireless mechanical
keyboard with cherry MX red switches the
lap board add-on accessory for that of
course for gaming in the living room
we've got the dark core special edition
RGB wireless gaming mouse with Qi
charging and of course the mm 1000
wireless Qi charging mouse pad which
also has the USB pass-through which is
kind of nice
Corsair has been making peripherals for
quite a while now and they do a very
good job at them so I think taking their
expertise and dumping into products like
these has led to some pretty compelling
products they do tend to be a little bit
more expensive though when it comes to
that Wireless functionality so it really
depends on whether you really want that
and really need that in order to enhance
your gaming experience whether you're
gaming on a desktop or gaming in the
living room I think Corsairs done a good
job and I'm gonna leave it up to you
guys to decide whether or not the price
lives up to the product quality when it
comes to these specific products I would
be interested to see a little bit more
direct testing with like a high-speed
camera of the response time from both
the mouse and the keyboard but hopefully
gamers Nexus might handle something like
that soon
for now though thank you guys so much
for watching this video hit the thumbs
up button of course if you enjoyed it
and links to these products is down in
the video's description below and of
