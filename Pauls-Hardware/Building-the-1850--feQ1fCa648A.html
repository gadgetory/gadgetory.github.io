shroud and helpful cable management
covers in the back the H 500 P will make
your next build both easy and sexy just
like me click the link in the
description for more hey guys how's it
going welcome to today's video I'm gonna
build a computer but I don't have all
the parts I need Joe is gonna help me
and we're price cuz we need an AMD
thread Ripper 1900 X to build our
entry-level threader per system let's go
shopping
alright it's an unexplored world of
technology Joe computer parts are
everyday this camera zoom so smoothly
guys price has obtained lead speak
technology
and II know what we want
1800 I don't think it's listed here I'd
have to ask the friendly salespeople hey
that wasn't too hard got my paperwork
gonna pick it up upfront meanwhile Joe's
looking for a USB card reader oh we got
unit UNIX it's not unisex it's unit
Rick's I guess that'll get the job done
and I'm cutting off the fries trip
because we could obviously spend way too
much time in here just looking at all
the various things that we could impulse
buy what a joke on the porn section too
I think it's only softcore here though
so we're gonna move on all we have to do
is navigate the the last impulse-buy
section in the checkout aisle
look at these through these pans like a
griddle it could make I could make
pancakes got it stay close all right I
don't know what to say
cuz we're about to get run over but
success okay it's like also I also got
one of Joe's USB 3 card readers because
you can never have enough USB 3 SD card
readers so we've returned from our
successful trip to Fry's I've got the
1900 he R on sale for $550 $50 off the
MSRP of $600 and you guys already might
know some of the rest of the parts that
I'm putting in this build but just in
case you don't this is intended to be an
entry level thread Ripper build and buy
entry level I mean if you want to get
into thread Ripper if you want an
enthusiast class high-end desktop
computer you've decided to go with AMD
you gotta get thread Ripper this is the
cheapest edge Ripper CPU that you can
buy the parts that I have pairing it
with are not the cheapest basement level
crap that you can get to go along and
build a functional computer it's a
little bit nicer than that but it's
still a bit more towards the budget than
a full-fledged system the idea being
that if you were to build this system
and get it parted out you'd have a very
powerful system right now and you have a
very nice upgrade paths upgrade your CPU
to an eight core or a I'm sorry upgrade
to a 12 core or a 16 course since this
is the 8 core and then potentially other
upgrades in the future from AMD we don't
really know about that but apart from
the 1900 X processor of course
have this motherboard from asrock the X
399 Taichi a very full-featured
motherboard and on the lower end of
price bracket when it comes to socket TR
for thread report for motherboards with
the X 399 chipset it's still going to
cost you upwards of 300 bucks about 330
340 as of the time of the making of this
video but that's still cheap sort of
when it comes to threader for
motherboards apart from that our case is
gonna be the fractal design mesh fic
chosen for the fact that it's a very
solid fractal case very well put
together well-constructed all the
features that you want to fit the
hardware that you wanted here and mesh
if I because it's got that full mesh
front panel plenty of airflow since this
is potentially going to be a system
that's a little bit more high-powered we
want to have lots of cooling available
for it so I thought this case would be a
good choice let's talk power supply
memory and storage our power supply is
this is just an IMDB box because I don't
have the retail box for this power
supply it is the Corsair RM 850 I and I
have used this power supply just briefly
although it didn't get too much use but
850 watt power supply which is more than
enough for the hardware that's going
into the system as well as having
expansion room in the future they fit
the I means it's intelligent you can
connect it up to the motherboard and use
the Corsair software to monitor some
stuff in there as well and of course all
of the modular cables it's got all black
cabling so it should look pretty nice to
the tempered glass window for storage or
at least for an operating system SSD
you're probably want more storage than
just this so I'd recommend getting a one
or two terabyte hard drive to go along
with this but about a 240 to 256 gig SSD
you can have right now for about 80 to
85 dollars so keep an eye out for
something like that and I have links in
the description to some of those I'm
using a Kingston HyperX savage this is a
240 gig SSD and this is kind of in the
same range as the others that would cost
about that same price finally for memory
my recommendation is a 4 by 4 gigabyte
kits of ddr4 memory and I recommend ddr4
3000 speed if not 3200 speed this kits
is not exactly that and actually the
Corsair kit I was planning to use for
this build I real
I don't have her it's actually in use of
the system over there so I'm gonna get
hit up Corsair for a replacement for
that so for the time being I'm gonna use
this G scale kit it is ddr4 and it's a
four by four gig kit I believe this is
rated at 20 666 but I will most likely
be swapping this out for the actual
finish build because and I haven't you
mentioned this but the finished build is
going to be available either via a
donation auction or just an auction
itself for a charity giveaway more on
that coming in the future though I'm
going to be doing that with a Kyle at
the beginning of December and now
unboxings this package arrives is just
in the past I want to say 24 hours but I
think it might have been 48 hours this
is directly from Nvidia and if this is
what I think it is and I'm pretty sure
it is what I think it is
keep talking here installing so I can
actually pull it out of the box look at
the gtx 1070 TI now the graphics card
that i originally chose in the original
parts list for this build that i did at
the beginning of this month and i
actually chose the gtx 1070 the gtx 1070
in my humble opinion would be kind of
your best bet right now when it comes to
getting a reasonably placed price
graphics card which should be around the
say 380 to $40 range combined with
something like a threader for build
which is definitely not on the cheap
side now 1070 TI is just launching and
this is going to cost a bit more than a
1070 however if you do have that extra
50 60 bucks to spare the 1070 TI should
be a nice boost in performance over the
gtx 1070 so for that purpose and for the
system's future use gonna be dropping in
the 1070 TI this is just the standard
founders Edition and I'm probably gonna
be swapping this out with a third-party
design 1070 TI for the actual finish
system giveaway but for the time being
this will get the system up and running
and also I get to unbox my 1070 TI so
that's exciting
and our final mystery unboxing
components to go into this build sent
over by our good friends at enter Max
and that is our cooler right there which
is the liquid tech OC tr4 and now
another budget option if you are
building an entry-level thread Ripper
system that I would probably recommend
you go with is not to as air coolers and
they have a hundred and twenty
millimeter version and a hundred and
forty millimeter version that can be had
for about sixty to eighty dollars
depending on where you buy them and deal
with all that kind of stuff now the
reason I recommend those is because you
can get the thread Ripper adapter you do
get an adapter that comes with your
thread Ripper processor that will let
you use an ace tech based closed-loop
CPU cooler and those have been available
for quite some time for quite a few
years however the contact plate on those
ace tech coolers is a little bit smaller
and even though it's enough to go over
the four risin dies it's in a threader
for CPU it's not the best when it comes
to the actual amount of thermal
dissipation that you get between the CPU
and your CPU cooler so for that purpose
and also because this is probably going
to end up being shipped and it's a
little bit more difficult to ship a
computer with an air cooler at our style
cooler in it than it is with a
all-in-one liquid cooler so for that
reason I hit up enter Macs and they were
kind enough to send over there no lick
tech oct are for version and this has a
specifically designed block that's much
larger to make much better contact with
the CPU itself providing better thermal
heat dissipation and it should work a
little bit better than the alternative
so those are all the parts I think it's
time to build now yes it's time to go
we're now opening our 1900 X I really
like how they put rip here for thread
Ripper there's a substantial packaging
with thread Ripper processors it's kind
of fun in the base down at the bottom
you'll actually get your mounting a
little screwdriver so hang on to that
that's also where that 8th Tec bracket
adapter is but we're not gonna be using
that so I'll keep that in the box for
whoever happens to end up with this
system and then at the back unlock the
power with the twist like so then our
threader for CPU comes out and now we
can take our bracket like that pop it up
like that and then we grip the top and
bottom like this and that comes off and
then we have our carrier frame right
there that slides out and the processor
stays in that frame we're gonna leave it
like so this is actually made to be
installed directly under the motherboard
and you can see just how actually large
this CPU is here's our animatics lick
lick the tech cooler large block a
little pump block combo there but there
you can just look at the contact plate
and I don't have a side-by-side here to
show an ace tech version but it's just
much larger and when you actually put it
side-by-side there with the risin
processor you can see that it's gonna
make a lot more contact much much more
contact so we're gonna use plenty of
thermal paste because that has also been
shown by quite a few different people
who have tested it more thermal paste
better contact between the heat spreader
on the CPU and our block on the CPU
liquid cooler it's going to give us the
best temperatures we can get for our
1900 X now guys I have an installation
video specifically on this so check that
out if you want to but just so you know
it's labeled on here open is three to
one so we're just going to use our Torx
wrench okay with this to unscrew
three and then to those actually weren't
even threaded on there's also I think
we're fine and then one and then this
should pop open beat actual sockets or
they suck at retention it is spring
loaded so it pops up like that and then
there's another piece underneath and
this is the actual carrier frame that
our processor is going to slide down
into this has a little dummy plastic
piece in there and there's actually a
couple little rails along each side that
that slides up and down on to so we're
just going to slide that up and remove
it and then we'll take our processor
and slide it down onto those rails like
so drops all the way down in there and
it kind of lines up with the bottom
there's a couple of little notches it'll
kind of slot into let me just drop that
back down kind of snaps into place
drop this lid down closing you want to
go the opposite way one two and then
three so we'll start with one right up
here make sure that's threaded I like
getting that one threaded and then
getting these threaded and then
tightening them down so let's get number
two threaded on there as well maybe and
sometimes these take a little bit of
pressure to get going
although those weren't too bad to
finally close things off bear in mind
that there's a specific amount of
pressure that this torque wrench is
torqued to so we can go until it is
pretty secure on there and then it
should give us a little snap once it's
all the way tighten it down that was it
so this actually spins in this little
snap on the center of it do that again
with number two as you can see I'm very
very coordinated today and so here as
it's getting tight it does a little snap
and that just means you've tightened it
down enough number three
s'okay there's a top exhaust and a rear
exhaust and I've decided that there's
only this one fan plug up here that's
position there's two down here I can
feed it down to but since there's only
two fans and neither of them are up
against radiators or anything I'm just
going to use a splitter real quick so I
can plug these both into this top left
plug
everything is coming together I'm just
lining up our inter max cooler down here
now it would actually maybe look better
this way and then your max logo would be
facing up although there's lots of extra
tubing so may might we might want to
flip it would bring the tubing out here
but it's still going to be coming down
like this is this graphics gonna be
right there so I just feel like it'll
it'll be fine like y'all put I'll put a
twist tie or something that kind of hold
it up right there I'll be fine then
we'll paste yeah you use lots of it and
we're gonna use the spread it around
method
I got the thermal paste all spread out
nice and even then I got excited and
went to just drop it on there but
there's actually these four screws I
have to put down there first
don't worry about thermal paste as you
can see it's nice and even on there so
far and air bubbles are typically not
much of a concern in this situation the
thermal paste after it warms up after
the CPU is amused will will get a little
bit looser a little bit more moved a
little bit more towards liquid state and
it will fill in any gaps and everything
anything that might be in there
well ladies and gentlemen I must say
that as this build came together we kept
commenting how like nice it was turning
out it's fairly compact I mean this is a
full-size ATX case but it's not that
long there's not a ton of drive space in
there for expansion however you do have
a couple drive bays at the bottom of
there's a couple more SSD mounts in
there so this does have some
expandability options when it comes to
storage but what I haven't done yet and
I'm going to do that would be to
actually turn the damn thing on so power
one power to glorious alright so
thankfully everything appears to work
which is good because I didn't do an
outside-of-the-box test build with this
hardware but I was very confident in it
of course and we're seeing also a very
limited amount of RGB LEDs in this case
there is a tiny accents that's on the
motherboard itself from asrock and you
can't control that with the software and
there's an RGB header on there so it
could be added to this if you did want
to go that route of course if you're
building this as a workstation then
maybe you don't want it to be super
bright and blingy and for that reason we
kind of liked it how it was turning out
which is a pretty mellow for the most
part when it comes to lighting at least
and also very compact and just like
everything kind of fit in there really
nicely also I will point out that our
graphics card was just barely long
enough to fit in here so do bear that in
mind if you're considering doing a front
mounted radiator with fans on this this
is a
slightly thicker radiator from inner max
it's probably a little bit more towards
30 millimeters wide and then with the
fans on there we didn't have enough room
but a longer graphics card might not fit
in there beyond that I routed the tubing
up north and I kind of zip tied it up
there a little bit just so it would hold
it up and out of the way we got the
inner max logo on there and that's
facing right side up which is nice as
well it does appear that you can remove
that panel off of the front of it and
flip that if you did decided to flip it
180 degrees if writing that tubing would
be a little bit easier for you that way
and we're not really using much of the
basement area down here like I already
mentioned so there is some expandability
options down there although the power
supply did just barely fit in there so
thankfully there's enough room for that
and enough room for all the hardware
inside but guys that is gonna wrap it up
for this video this has been my
entry-level thread Ripper build and once
again this build is going to be going
towards charity breakfast on the fence
how we're going to do the charity event
but it's either going to be where each
an auction off a computer this one for
me and then when the cow is going to
build and then all that money will go to
charity or we're going to accept
donations and then like a small dollar
amount like 5 bucks of a donation will
enter you in a drawing to win the
systems we're still figuring that up so
if you guys have any feedback for us and
how you think that little giveaway thing
would be best friend leave that in the
comment section down below all the links
to the parts I'm using in this system
are also linked in the video description
down below so check those out thank you
guys so much for watching this video and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
