once again to Paul's hardware this is my
video on the asus Ares 2 which I don't
have here I had one here I ran a bunch
of benchmarks on it and then I had to
bring it back and return it but I do
have some stock footage for some some
pictures I took of it what was here so I
will be sharing those with you and at
the same time for those of you who might
not be familiar with what the Asus area
is to actually is apart from the couple
videos already have on our new mega TV
YouTube channel I did want to share at
least some of the specs to familiarize
you guys with it this is a dual GPU card
so it uses two AMD Radeon HD 7970
gigahertz Edition GPUs both on the same
board everything is entirely custom
designed by Asus they did a ton of work
with this card it has a custom
water-cooled design so you get a
closed-loop water cooler attached to the
card with 120-millimeter radiator here's
a quick exploded view as well so you can
kind of see a little bit more with the
construction again full videos on this
over on the new ITV channel so not gonna
take up too much time right here but I
did want to talk a little bit about the
card for one thing as well as kind of
reply to some of the questions and
comments that I got on some of our new
atv videos because some of them were
we're pretty interesting and at least
wanted to provide a reply and some of my
own personal thoughts and opinions on
this card the first and biggest point
that people brought up was the cost
because it cost $1500 it's a limited
edition card they only made a thousand
of them and pretty much it's already
sold out so they're gonna be really hard
to get right now so from a collector's
edition kind of standpoint I mean you
can you might see some value in that as
far as it being worth more money a lot
of people were saying well why don't I
just go ahead and buy 379 70s you can do
that in fact I might just be sharing
some 79-73 way across Forex benchmarks
but I'll get to that in a minute
and you could do that so I guess the
question here be do I see the value in
this card and I actually as I was
testing it decided yes I kinda
- I've never gone out and bought a card
of this caliber myself personally I'm
lucky enough to have gotten to try one
and test one but when you take into
account that you have custom picked 7970
GPUs that are pre overclocked and that
you can overclock even more when you
take into account that it's got the
custom closed-loop water cooler on it
because if you were going to water cool
your video cards especially with a
custom loop that's going to take some
work and some additional money to buy
all the different hardware that's needed
for that so that's another thing so I
kind of do see the value in it now again
you could get more performance for the
same amount of money by going triple
cross triple crossfire X or 3-way SLI or
something like that
but for people who don't want to go all
out like that for people who don't want
the cards to run super hot because they
did all of this within a 600 watt
thermal envelope and the highest the
highest temperature I saw on the GPUs on
any of my tests 64 degrees Celsius and
that's what the card being overclocked
the 12:25 on the GPU and gosh should I
forget right now but I think something
like 8000 on the memory which which is
pretty good overclock and I did that
without too much tweaking and too much
work so I think anybody would be able to
hit that with this card so that's that I
think there's two main reasons why Asus
goes down this road and makes these
types of cards because they've done it
before with the Mars with the area
series hopefully they'll continue to do
it in the future and a couple different
reasons I think one is for publicity
because let's face it if you have the
fastest video card that's out there
people are going to talk about it I'm
talking about it you guys are listen to
me talk about it the second reason I
think is because they're actually
getting some R&amp;amp;D with it Asus I do not
believe and this is my personal
speculation but I do not think Asus
makes money on these cards even though
they're very expensive the amount of
time and effort that goes into designing
them is not equal to the number of them
that they sell because they it's a
limited edition they're only making a
thousand of them whether you're talking
about the PCB layout whether you're
talking about closed-loop water water
cooling on a video card we've seen that
before ZOTAC had a water-cooled GTX 580
that I got to try out but the way Asus
did it and the way they implemented it
with a dual GPU card I think was just
pretty smart and
turned out to be a really good product
so that's kind of my stance on the card
look at it this way if a year or two
down the line you start seeing like the
kind of more basic high-end cards of the
four to five hundred dollar cards
selling what the closed-loop water
cooling option wouldn't that be nice
wouldn't you kind of go for that because
the cards stay cooler you can overclock
them more and I like the closed-loop
water coolers because you can take the
rad you can bolt it on anywhere it's
really secure anyway so let's go and do
let's at the benchmarks benchmarks yes
now what I did here because another big
question on the videos was benchmarking
and how I was comparing the cards and
people are saying how could you take the
areas to and compare it to a gtx 680
stock gtx 680 by itself that's not fair
and and really guys I wasn't trying to
say look at these two cards will the 680
beat the Aries - that's not my point my
point is that if I show you the Aries to
score in 3d mark 11 and I don't even
know what the score is off the top of my
head but here's the score if you have
anything to compare that so you can't
say well relative to what
so the 680 was there more to say well
here's a 680 here's kind of the
performance gap between them which I
hope is still valuable for you guys but
this video this video is more about a
benchmark battle so what I did by
popular demand was I took my areas to
benchmarks took my hair used to
overclocked benchmarks running on this
test but over here which is a 39 60 X on
the overclocked benchmarks overclocked
to the 4.5 gigahertz basic benchmarks
running at stock speeds and set it all
up on that and I tested it yes against
six 80s in SLI to give you guys a more
fair performance hailed championship
challenge between these cards and a bit
more like head-to-head combat now bear
in mind - 680 is not going to cost as
much as the Ares 2 and then I think with
that we're about ready to go but oh
actually here's here's another question
from our fans okay a couple other things
I forgot the GTX 690 hmm
I should put the areas due against the
GTX 690 but I don't have one I got one
so briefly before the 690 launched I got
to match market then those were pre
launched drivers from like literally I
think almost a year ago so um
without one to retest right now with
current drivers on the current testbed
with updated everything I don't feel
right comparing those to each other same
thing with the double 1379 90 by power
color again I don't have one right now
to test on this testbed in particular
and I don't have one to test with
updated been with updated drivers
because that does affect the outcome
anyway oh I see another suggestion here
how about the 79th sight and said how
about these 79 70s in in crossfire x2
way that is a good question alright
figure out ofin I will also be throwing
in the H is ice qx2 version of the
Radeon HD 7970 gigahertz Edition again
this is a factory overclocked version of
the 7970 the GPU frequency on this one
is going to be running at 1050 so I got
two of these in two-way crossfire X they
got custom coolers so that should give a
little bit better performance comparison
because these are 7970 gigahertz
additions against the 7970 gigahertz
additions in the areas to house that
that work for you guys
no I see it doesn't ok gtx 680 stock is
like why would you even bother doing
that testing the stock gtx 680 when
there's so many like custom awesome gtx
680 s that are out there you can test it
against well it might mean another four
or five hours of benchmarking guys but
i'm gonna do that for you right now okay
so i have will now be also including
along with the gtx 680 reference design
sli benchmarks 2-way SLI i'll also be
including two-way SLI benchmarks with
this guy right here this is the galaxy
gtx 680 GC overclocked custom-designed
white edition PCB
GTX 680 so I'll also be doing this guy
into a SLI and hopefully that should
satisfy all the requested comparisons
wait one last question what would it
take to beat the Aries - a very good
question
now I would show you guys some 3-way
benchmarks but I do have some three they
have benchmarks actually I have 3-way
benchmarks which with the H is Radeon HD
7970 gigahertz edition xqx - I'm kind of
curious the Ares - overclocked against
3-way crossfire X bear in mind guys my
through my crossfire X numbers not on
the same test bench these were on a
gigabyte C 77 X u p7 motherboard so
that's a z77 chipset
that's a 3770k processor the gigabyte
motherboard has a multiplexing chip so
it actually is really good for three and
four way across 4x or SLI benchmarks
everything else is on the same test bed
with the three 960 X I am just benched
no more time for benchmarking so here
you go guys my benchmark battle with the
Ares 2
all right there you go that was a lot of
work condense down into 20 or 30 seconds
benchmark footage but hopefully those
charts and graphs are gonna give you
guys a better idea of who won what
benchmark so just to sort of give my
summation of what we just looked at the
areas to performed really well it was
able to actually beat even like standard
CrossFireX 7970 gigahertz additions and
some of the tests and actually when
overclocked beat in just about all the
tests so overclocking it's fantastic but
of course the 3-way crossfire X
configuration did come out on top so if
you're gonna be in areas - you got to go
with a three GPU configuration or you
gotta overclock the crap out of your
existing 79 70s and as you guys many
people that sell I spent a lot of time
on the benchmarks for this video and
unfortunately that's one last thing that
I could have done
I could overclock the 79 70s here but I
ran out of time I'll see if I have a
chance to do that in the future but I'm
not gonna make any promises that's gonna
wrap it up for this video guys again now
this has been my benchmark battle but
the issues area is - as well as a
collection of the video cards that you
guys can see in front of me thank you
very much for watching if you enjoy the
benchmark battle types of videos please
toss a like my way be sure to subscribe
if you want to see more thanks everyone
we'll see you all next time
