Pauls hardware today's video is a little
bit different than usual it's actually
going to be a little bit of a personal
update as well as talking more about
what I'm planning to do but have not
done quite yet first off personal update
things have been incredibly incredibly
busy for me especially considering all
the stuff going on at work with newegg
TV we for instance just earlier this
week went up to Santa Clara visited
nvidia we've been doing stuff for their
project shield launch which is just now
finally been announced pre-orders are on
we've actually gotten some decent amount
of hands-on time with that which has
been pretty cool I think it's pretty
pretty nice device I like the I like the
angle that nvidia is coming at it with
but yeah so we spent some time up there
we have quite a few things coming up in
the very near future some stuff I can't
talk about other stuff I can the stuff
that I can is that actually we're going
to taipei taiwan taipei taiwan for
computex this year so i'm actually
leaving in gosh i guess a little over a
week i'm going to be there for over two
weeks so in that time i might not be
able to post here on my channel quite as
frequently i I don't want to promise
anything i'm going to try to shoot some
video there and upload to my channel but
if i am not able to do that we are going
to be shooting video there and uploading
to newegg TV channel so you guys can
check that out if you want to see
coverage of what we're doing there there
should be some exciting stuff going on
at computex and i've never been to
taiwan either so that should also be a
lot of fun apart from that you guys have
probably or maybe maybe you've heard a
little bit about some the projects i've
had going on here at home for my channel
the main one that i've been working on
has been my cpu cooler comparison in my
close loop cpu cooler comparison and
that one has had its ups and downs um I
should be right up there with you guys
and say that I haven't done nearly as
much work on it as I should have hence
this case next to me hence the reason to
h110 is still in its box back there
behind me but I digress what it's going
to come down to is a three-way cpu
cooler benchmark
between the coarser h110 which is a 280
millimeter radiator the thermaltake
water two point O extreme which is a 240
but it's a thicker radiator and the
swiftech h220 which is a copper radiator
also 240 millimeters so I've been really
trying to get that under way and my most
recent dilemma was the discovery that's
to my surprise probably due to the lack
of proper research beforehand none of
the cases I have here are actually going
to be able to accommodate all three of
those coolers I wanted to use the same
case and all of them so again to that
end that's why I have the NZXT phantom
630 right here it has a massive radiator
mounting point up at the top it will
accommodate all three of those coolers
and it's a case that I actually worked
with before so I have some experience
with it I'm plan to do a review this
case as well once I have this whole bill
done and everything but I want to get a
bit more hands-on time with it first
before I come out and give you guys my
final thoughts on it but I think it's
going to work great for my tests but
it's still in the box and the system is
not set up and the coolers are still in
their boxes and and and as i mentioned
i'm going to taiwan soon so I'm going to
really really try to get this done
before I go i'm also going to try this
weekend to shoot some more videos so i
have some more stuff maybe to space out
while I'm gone anyway that's pretty much
what's going on with me right now for
the rest of this video though I am going
to be setting up my test bed in here so
let me get you give you guys a quick
look at the parts involved and then i
will show you me actually building this
tonight probably just going to do a
speed through like i usually do but yeah
here's a look at the components so
here's essentially what i'm going to be
using for the testing platform for some
storage for the main operating system
out of a kingston hyperx one of the
original hyperx drives 240 gigs so i
will be using that for the OS not that
that's going to affect my cpu testing
scores too much the cpu testing i have a
3770k which is already installed right
there as well as four by four gigs of
corsair vengeance ddr3 memory that's
actually the Vengeance low profile and
then of course all in the asus
sabertooth
ne7 motherboards so those are my
components and at this point I'm going
to say fond farewell to all you guys
watching out there i'm going to go ahead
and show you guys the build process here
because this is what i'm going to be
doing for the rest of the night
assembling this and hopefully getting my
testing underway i know i didn't show
you guys the power supply that one's
actually over there i think i'm going to
use an antec 1200 watt just because i
have it and and might as well yeah but
more on the how I set up this testing
configuration in the future of course
thanks for watching guys don't forget to
subscribe and like the video if you
enjoyed it I hope to be bringing you
coverage from Taiwan if I can but if not
we'll see you all as soon as I possibly
can get another video produced
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
