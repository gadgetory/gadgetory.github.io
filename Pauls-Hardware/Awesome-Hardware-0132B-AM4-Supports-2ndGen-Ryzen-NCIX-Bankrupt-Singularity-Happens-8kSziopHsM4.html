just we're just pausing for a moment as
the Internet's spool up but hello I
think we should be live now welcome
welcome to awesome hardware this is a
show about technology and indeed that's
we're gonna that's what we're gonna talk
about today we're going to talk about
some tech news we're going to talk about
some some science-based stuff and the
first thing that I should tell you guys
is that you should not have high
expectations for my half of the show no
indeed I want to set the bar as low as
possible under-promise over-deliver I
like waiting pong for one awesome
hardware is a show that we do every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific and
we split it into two halves in the first
half of today's show which is episode
number 132 has already been live
streamed to Kyle's channel bit wit and
the link to that is in the video's
description
so we've already been talking about
technology and drinking beer and having
just just a wonderful time okay ol time
exactly and now I am gonna be talking
about stuff but we begin with the
harrowing tale of frantic attempting to
get ready for the show several hours ago
at which points I was diligently
allowing the streaming computer to do
Windows updates as well as xsplit
updates at which point I cited me asleep
I did well I did one than the other cuz
I can everything's got to be up-to-date
sure um an exploit decided to stop
getting the feed from the camera the
Blackmagic anyway there was a budget
there was a big mess and I had it kind
of go through and try to figure things
out and I ended up capturing with a
completely I'm using the ripsaw today
razor rip saw his rip saw for the win
this is where our video signal is coming
to you guys from today it looks great as
you can see the green light indicate the
the driver is properly loaded
point being that ate up all my time for
my proper research and note-taking as I
usually do so although I do have the
news segments and AI segment and a tales
from space segment that we're going to
be going over today some of the depth of
detail might be missing there so we'll
be reading some of that stuff along with
you guys totally cool
all that said if you're not impressed
already with our live show maybe invest
some money in it
Paul's hardware net isn't where you can
go to to buy stuff from my store I got
some key caps I got some bottle openers
I got some shirts we got on some
hardware shirts now as well as a new 15
ounce mug I'm having a sale right now
December discounts if you spend over $50
you get this is 10% off over $100 you
get 20% off so check it out buy some
stuff it's all real high-quality and
thank you guys for your support here do
bigwig tech slash stores Cal store very
similar situation to me buy stuff it's
all good good stuff yep shirts these
these 20 ml boy oh boy Imperial pint
glasses are fantastic even the spinners
fidget spinners if you're on the tail
end of that oh yeah friend but yeah if
you guys my stuff during the show we'll
give you a quick shout out at the end of
the show and when it comes to my half of
the show we're gonna try to kind of plow
through this as quickly as we possibly
can it's do it alright let's start off
with news and the big news depends this
news depends it like it's either really
big news or it's like I've already heard
this news it depends on how we're both
closely you followed what AMD said over
the past year about their Zen stuff this
is a tech powerup article by the way
whether you believe them and whether you
find for the confirmation to be
significant or nuts there has apparently
been some further confirmation this was
an AMD interview with overclockers UK
that has stated very specifically that
the second generation horizon desktop
processors will support the existing am4
socket now AMD has kind of already said
this before they've said m4 is going to
around mm-hmm and poor is gonna be our
socket until 2020 that's the year that
they listed their now which is awesome
there is the possibility that they could
have been just like blowing smoke up
everyone's ass and actually what they
wanted to do was keep doing like you
know rising one stuff on a m4 but when
they come out with their next-gen
they're gonna come out with a new
platform or something like that what's
possibility so sure if you're looking at
it that way this maybe is a little bit
further confirmation that anyone who's
investing in a name for socket
motherboard has a reasonable expectation
that they're gonna have some more
processors that will slot into that and
be supported it'll be current gen yeah
next generation is called pinnacle ridge
by the codename that is going to be Zen
- or second generation horizon or rise
in Gen 2 or whatever I don't think
there's actually any official name for
it yet
but if you have a name for motherboard
you would need a BIOS updates you need
to update for the latest to Jesus at one
point zero zero seven version and the
AMD rep James prayers confirmed it in
the interview that a.m. for will work so
that's pretty cool also those potential
that they're going to be shrinking down
to a 12 nanometer process down from 14
for risin 2 which would enable higher
clock speeds sweet so that's pretty good
too um and I think this is a really good
tactic for AMD to take when they're
competing with Intel because that's been
something that Intel gets critiqued
about a lot is their turnover and
platforms or something and that kind of
thing granted the mainstream platform at
least if you go back to LGA 1150 the
stuff merit is to Sandy Bridge was the
last time they did a one-year platform
but these e3 70 stuff a lot of people
are critiquing that isn't backwards
compatible with cable akin and and
skylake so yeah there you go there but
yeah good to know there is the chance
however that aimed you might come out
with a new chipset so new chipsets still
a name yeah it was still a m4 socket but
new chipset beyond X 370
and a new chipset might enable say a
greater number of PCI Express Lanes
from the CPU or that kind of thing right
so there is still a possibility that you
might be compelled to buy a new
motherboard for the gun to stuff as a
result of that we'll keep an eye out for
that but for now this appears to be good
news this week we're gonna quickly talk
about net neutrality I'm not going to
dwell on this too long because time is
growing short we only have about nine
days until the December 14th vote by the
FCC as to whether or not they want to
keep the current title to classification
for Internet service providers which is
how net neutrality is currently enforced
or whether they want to roll that back
they have indicated they want to roll
that back that seems like what they're
gonna do most Americans seem like they
don't want that to happen but there's
been lots of feedback for it and there
have been 50,000 comments made our net
neutrality complaints I should say this
is separate from the the comments so
back in May the FCC made a notice of
proposed rulemaking and they open it up
for comments and there were over 22
million comments submitted and that's a
big point of controversy right now is
where those comments came from and and
that kind of thing and whether the FCC
is going to delay in order to allow
further investigation into that all that
aside though ever since 2015 ISP you
sift and classified as common carriers
which means that the FCC is the
governing or the agency that regulates
them so ever since 2015 there has been
the ability for the public to complain
if they find Internet service providers
acting in a way that is contrary to
basic title T regulations or net
neutrality there been fifty thousand and
fifty thousand of those complaints and
they've been excluded from the repeal
docket so these complaints that have
been made about net neutrality and
fractions are basically being excluded
from this look and this is just further
evidence of the FCC's sort of wanton
dismissal of the American public's
opinion in how they should proceed in
this and how the government the Internet
should be regulated
so all this is to say I actually did a
video that is I've already shot but
hasn't been posted yet with wendyl from
level one techs specifically going over
pretty in-depth a lot of stuff about net
neutrality and that will be up on my
channel in the next couple days so
hopefully you guys will watch it if you
want to learn a little bit more and
there's also a sort of sister video to
that that's going to go on level one
text where we went into into even more
depth into that going back and looking
at stuff like the 1996
Telecommunications Act looking at what
Internet Service Providers promised
Americans which in case you're not aware
they sort of signed a contract with the
FCC in with America that by 2005 like a
hundred percent of American households
would have fibre to the house fibre to
the home right with a 40 megabit
connection for $20 a month that's the
promise they made in 1996 promise fail
by 2005 which was 12 years ago and now
they and now they're saying they need to
like you know restrict the internet and
charge people more for their bandwidth
than everything because they haven't
followed up with the promises that they
made anyway all that is to say level 1
text is also having a giveaway going on
right now so if you check out the video
description the links down there you can
go over to their forward giveaway thing
and they have actually I believe it's a
8700 K based system I just they're
giving away in combination with several
other channels so check it out go win
some stuff just just a little little ko
plug there moving on ncx has filed for
bankruptcy did you see this coming
kind of I didn't really think about it I
kind of saw this coming
only because I follow their YouTube
channel and if you look at like the
stuff that happen recently with Riley
and I he's leaving stuff meaning I mean
as far as I knew they just like the NZXT
YouTube channel everyone has left like
if you look at what happens with us back
at our former employer when we
decided like hey were we're we're gonna
leave because of various reasons sure
there are reasons that are compelling us
to leave seems like kind of the same
thing happening over the same thing
happened but like because we left like
we left but like Newegg didn't go under
and go bankrupt yeah I didn't go so true
and that's almost I think why I didn't
see it coming because I was part of the
new egg
breakaway when we went our whole YouTube
channel just dissolved and yet the
company new egg still kept going and so
when the same thing exactly happened to
the NCA X YouTube channel there was the
furthest thing from my mind that the
entire company's at jeopardy and is
gonna go bankrupt I thought you know
that maybe they had all left for similar
reasons that we did but obviously that
wasn't the case I personally didn't see
it coming
I'm sure like a lot of other key players
at NCA NCIX or it may be even Linus good
see this a mile away but I so yeah I
think the the comparison there to like
the ncx versus new egg is NCIX a lot of
people knew of because of Linus and
because of the YouTube channel they had
a very successful social media platform
due to the YouTube channel now look at
what Linus has done you know he's one of
the top most recognized tech youtubers
globally now you know he's making crazy
amounts of money compared to what NC X
is doing with their YouTube channel now
yeah by comparison Newegg had a YouTube
channel that they grew for a while as we
were working it on it and everything
like that but no egg wasn't necessarily
as defined by the YouTube channel as I
feel like NC x was sure being a Canadian
based company which has you know Canada
has about to sit at the same rifle Eva
Canada has has fewer less population
than California for example so there's a
lot fewer people up there so it's a
smaller market so because of that I
guess seeing some of the deterioration
of what was going on with the YouTube
channel was a big chunk of their company
yeah yeah branch like we were yeah yes
so mcx was founded in
1996 by Steve Wu and Burnaby British
Columbia was a walk-in retail outlets
and 20 and maybe seven when they started
an online service as well they competed
against traditional retailers as well as
online rifles like Amazon and Newegg and
at this points they have a supreme
bankruptcy filing cream does that mean
they have a bankruptcy that is
accompanied by sour cream yeah sour
cream and guacamole
I blew so I actually caught bankruptcy
ice cream I caught a bit of the last the
win-win-win show on Friday about this
because they were discussing it a little
bit yeah and they were they were
confused about supreme bankruptcy I was
like dude sorry man welcome only the
works maybe some some chunky salsa
freaking Canadians that is what makes it
the supreme bankruptcy and you go yeah I
was kind of surprised but yeah last tech
tips posted a picture on the store in
Richmond British Columbia about it being
permanently closed so Herman our actual
retail locations shutting down this
apparently is the location that Linus
got his first job at in the PC industry
this is where he was he was a retail
store person for a while so yeah there's
a lot of history going on there and
stuff so this sad I mean to see to say
the company go under again if you guys
want a little bit more like actual
insider information if you guys didn't
already see the wind show I did watch
that bit on it and Linus actually sucked
a decent amount about his you know
conflicting with with the management's
certain predictions he had you know he
was a product product manager there and
everything and worked his way up to
where he was he was pretty high up and
everything so um he had some decent
amount of insight there as well as he
talked about some of his ideas about
where he thought the company should go
which you know you can't say if they had
done this then they would have been
successful in retrospect that sounds
sounded like a good idea and everything
he had this idea of making very small
stores that would
you know that would hold like very
popular inventory but a very small
amount of it yeah in order to deal with
the issue of shipping in Canada because
shipping is very expensive in Canada so
you could have stuff shipped to the
store and give it that way and
everything which I mean seemed like a
good idea who knows if it would have
worked out or not but right yeah rip ncx
I guess yeah busy it's crazy it's crazy
to think that they're gone
yeah it'll be a while for me to like
fully recover from like I wonder what
the NZXT NCIX YouTube channels up to and
and they're like I'm gonna realize it
also so I can exist anymore were you
aiming like if I I mean I have no idea
what any internally its internal stuff
going on there whatever be like if I had
to choose I'd be like let's get through
the holidays like sell as much of our
inventories right yeah I have one last
hurrah who are some of some of our
investment that kind of thing but right
having it happen right at the end of
November beginning of December the
website apparently is still working out
and looked at it today I'm also really
curious to see like the the the you know
the next vh1 updates like NCIX youtubers
where are they now because I'm curious
like are they all gonna be snatched up
by
ltte are they gonna go are they gonna
stay in tech or are they gonna be you
know forever forever lost to us so Riley
Riley has his own channel now that's
keys yeah I always liked his stuff I
thought he did he's really good
presenter and stuff
yeah and had some some good jokes and
whatnot yeah but yeah it'd be cool to
see him join the the Linus Media Group
yeah you know they do good work in stuff
I hope they stick around anyway it's
that side
long story short success we've destroyed
NCIX yay no no sorry I was I was at new
eggwin new expanded to Canada and that
was kind of like the the undercurrent of
I was like yeah let's get him let's get
him and we didn't but yeah but they got
themselves everything to do it that cool
all right
since copy Lake has launched in the past
couple months there's been some blowback
towards Intel because copy Lake is not
Hannibal not backwards compatible even
though it still uses the same socket LGA
1151 you need a Z 370 motherboard to
ward ground pins or something like that
right apparently and Intel's explanation
was that due to the additional power
requirements of going up to like the six
core options like you have with an
eighty five hundred and eighty seven
hundred K that that's why they needed to
not make it backwards compatible
according to this video cards article
which derives from a Baidu article which
derives from PC lab article so this
comes from China there is a modder who
has gone and modded a Z 170 motherboard
specifically an MSI z170a xpower
titanium done modifications to both the
CPU microcode and the BIOS in order to
get an 80 350 K to work on the C 170
motherboard this seems super legit from
what I can tell here it's already toriel
there are no no this this is beyond the
capacity of most user and the
speculation also here is that because
he's using using the quad core 83 50 K
which is a lot more akin to what would
be compatible as the 170 like you know
you're just guy like 67 m okay 6600 k
quad cores yeah it's potentially why
it's able to handle its bright also the
X power titanium from MSI is a high-end
motherboard that does have pretty over
built power delivery sure all that said
the BIOS is listing right here with the
z170 motherboard and the 8350 k there's
a ton of different screen shots of cpu-z
CPU Z gone with the CPI D and actually
showing the CPU ID signature and
comparing it to what's going on
microcode and everything just in to
children yes we believe you this is
legit plenty of screen caps and
everything so all you need is like a
$400 motherboard for your core i3 yeah
uncuff you late apparently and
you need add I mean it's cool it's cool
but yeah Andrew from Asus confirmed just
a few weeks ago that the decision to it
disabled coffee lake s support NZ to 170
and 270 was dictated directly by Intel
even though older motherboards can
easily support them this is just an
actual use case of someone actually
going in and making the necessary
modifications and everything to get it
working on that which is pretty cool
yeah often times you wonder how locked
out it is when they make things
incompatible that maybe you didn't think
about of all right and yeah whether it's
like the old school pencil trick or
whatever else yeah kind of cool it
they're able to get that up and running
alright next segment sure new segment a
brand new segment on the show I'm sure
it's gonna be very popular I even made a
new lower thirds for it what's it gonna
be what is it what do we go we're all
gonna die what is it we're all gonna die
yes die as endure AI Dai this is the AI
say hey I D we're all gonna die we're
all gonna die' eh
I guess that's about AI love it
we're all gonna die well the unboard hey
there we go we got the new haha robot
dude down there face obviously
representing yeah so we're gonna talk
about some AI related stuff first off
and I should mention a couple of these
articles did come from the level 1 techs
their weekly news show that they usually
post on Monday evening although I've
completely lost track because if several
of these I saw during the week and
pulled them up and a couple of those of
us on the show so anyway I just wanted
to give some credit there um
point being over on CNN Tech 375 million
jobs may be automated by 2030 that's in
13 years by the way sooner than you
might expect
this is a new report by the McKinsey
Global Institute cautions that as many
as 375 million workers will need to
switch occupational categories by 2030
due to automation
basically the robots the AI they're
coming they're coming for you they're
gonna him they got to take a job how
does that work then I mean all these
people cause obviously the AI is gonna
be doing like more simplistic jobs right
then I can be doing super complex stuff
so a lot of people who maybe don't have
college degrees or don't have like super
high education they're gonna be out of a
job because a bot will be able to do it
for them better than they can probably
and then the only and like yeah then
people are saying well that'll open up
more jobs cuz people need to make a
robot true but the people who like the
people who are getting put out of a job
I'm not gonna be qualified enough after
you ran ahead I feel like you're setting
up my next my next articles really well
I had no idea I'm just like Griffin on
on this right now so obviously as Kyle
Lohse stating right now the automation
the fear of automation and the robots
coming and taking your job and the AI
and what not only is to be feared if
you're you know doing manual labor
simple jobs that kind of thing that can
easily be replaced by robots or that
kind of thing anything that might be say
creative or require inspiration or you
know the uniqueness of the human mind
say like making art something like that
yeah he's never gonna take come for us
and and take over that kind of thing
they've even tackled that is that even
happening they're gonna be
Picasso BOTS check out this heavy metal
album it's actually a black metal album
a machine it is made by the group known
as Dada BOTS it is their debut album it
was created by a neural network studying
the work of a human metal band called
Crowley's or Crowley's basically they
they would feed it parts of the music
and then they would the AI would spit
something out back at them and they'd be
like yeah that's good or no that's bad
and they would train it that way the the
album is called code in T of timeless it
has five tracks address the frickin
shreds man it's ridiculous you can
actually listen to the entire okay
listen to one of the tracks can we do
eggs dream I hope we're not gonna get
flagged or anything like that I just
wanna alright
we touch every word okay yeah so this is
all produced by a bot yeah by BOTS okay
I can make that I can make that on my
phone right now
that's just like screeching at a man ah
ah I mean no no it just sounds like it's
black metal so maybe I just don't get it
maybe they're just not black maybe seven
LOM metal and to understand that this is
actually a real masterpiece I don't know
man I think we're a long way off enter
enter giveness just because we can have
them make songs doesn't mean that
they're gonna be here oh listen to that
wait they all sound exactly the same
you're Kevin to every song that you've
played so far it could have easily just
been one song and no one would doubt you
this black belt Kyle you don't
understand I don't understand
oh did you - I didn't how to understand
the commitment of time this track just
replicated five times and they call it
an album I'm sorry I think this is
awesome I think it's crazy
yeah not like someone said in chat just
now there's no emotion to it it's very
sterile I think I think we're okay I
think I think all the black metal
artists are safe your job security as a
black metal artist is safe for now
hey hey keep on shredding look if you if
you can't appreciate genius of code
didn't I - hey you know hey you know
some people are gonna get it super hyped
about this I'm like tattoo couldn t have
time just like on their neck oh yeah
problem you spooky the best band ever
man you know cuz they're robots men
didn't even have souls their souls to
make music meant F an appointment for a
tattooing all right hey so while we were
discussing cadet nib tiny
timeless from my understanding the
singularity happy
the singularity yes at least according
to this article on futurism Google's
article gence has built an AI that
outperforms any made by humans so that
is an AI building an AI that is superior
to the AI we were able to build real AI
building another AI and from my
understanding singularity right that's
it's just
it's iterative it builds on itself and
given an infinite amount of computing
power and kidding I don't know what I
don't know what these kites have to do
with anything but apparently this is how
the robots take over just by an N in
money everything's a percentage the
kites the kites are okay the people are
what it's targeting to kill I think
that's what ah yeah 99 percent gonna
kill this yeah these gonna kill that to
99 percent they thread the robot that's
the kite in the air is pretty
threatening at 99 percent as well but
you know probably supporting a person
that's why it's identified kill the kite
and you'll kill the guy yeah kill the
dude all right make sense so again I
wish I I wish I could rattle off a few
more of the specifics from this article
but due to lack of time today I'm gonna
have to direct you to the link of this
video's description if you want to
resume doc more on that point being
though google's AI has made an AI that's
smarter than itself so nice section
officially I believe I believe that's
the singularity I'm pretty sure that's
the singularity it's happening I already
achieved but you are lumped we're all
gonna die I Dai but what's gonna happen
with the AI killer robots that's really
the question of course it's probably
going to be lots of countries that build
AI killer robots Russia in particular
very interested in AI killer robots they
have specifically stated at a meeting in
Geneva earlier this month that any UN
say sanctions or rules against the
Russia's development of robots they're
gonna ignore okay so that's gonna Trek
on yeah truck on Russia said they would
not adhere to any room for any
prohibitions on killer robots that's
been stated okay very very clear kill
rods are gonna happen which makes sense
if I was her if I was Russia I I would
want killer robots to oh yeah Jesu
Russia there's nothing to do there but
seeming sonic sense and make killer
robots but the fact is that the UN isn't
going to stop them here's a picture of
equality UN stupid like they're not
gonna kill a robot Kalashnikovs
automated weapons not you snap we've
shown them here on the on the channel
before let's move on though thanks
alright so how are robots going to
strangle you until you're dead good
question Kyle we are all good Harvard
and MIT scientists have built robot
muscles that can lift 1000 times their
own weight
robot muscle yes robot muscle is a row
because robots are gonna they're gonna
need to overpower their human
counterparts and obviously having
superior intelligence even though it's
artificial isn't sufficient they're
gonna have to take advantage of the
robot muscles other muscles artificial
hey it's a little too deep or whatever
this makes soft robots safer uh yeah
well these sorry the researchers at
Harvard's Wyss Institute and mi t--'s
computer science and artificial
intelligence laboratory announced
November 27th they've created robotic
muscles that can lift up to 1,000 times
their own weight
they're simple objects constructed out
of metal or plastic skeletons that are
covered in either liquid or air then
sealed in plastic or fabric fabric skins
the muscle pulls taut when a vacuum is
created inside the skin and goes slack
when the vacuum is released by folding
the skeletons in different ways hence
origami are they comparing our muscles
muscle plastic bags kind of got it that
appears to be how how it basically
functions all right
but it's got a bunch of bags in our
bones also they've got the banana they
got the banana for scale there so you
have to give them that yeah very
accurate scientific so yeah I'm looking
forward to this being combined with guns
and lamb and with machine guns and
lasers as Cal has just mentioned also
with this video posited a thousand times
their own weight that's pretty that's
more than scary yeah I can't lift 1,500
pounds 1600 pounds I would die
have you seen have you seen the new
antlers have you seen that we oh yeah
 this thing we didn't show this on
the channel or on the livestream yet but
this thing Boston Dynamics this was a
earlier November this is a it's almost a
month ago and like the fact that this
there's a new robot so if there's a
video on this that means that there's
even crazy robots that aren't even being
shown to us yet oh yeah yeah this is
child's play but still this isn't even
using the super 1000 times more powerful
muscles I know the magnet bags anyone
imagine house look at the flip and then
it raises its arms and triumphs what was
that was the chick of a crazy Olympic
chick black chick in the Olympics why
but Simone pile
oh yeah Simone biles I ain't got on
this Atlas bot from a positive dynamics
okay Elon Musk robot in response to that
and said yeah give it a few years and
they'll move so fast you won't be able
to see them I saw that yeah Terra
Frankie um thanks to you on anyway she
ate it bro let's move on to some more
uplifting news you can not sleep at
night now our final segment until we do
the Q&amp;amp;A and stuff is of course wait wait
wait we're all going to do all right
lean back and don't don't yell really
loud ready
Tales from space
might've done it I don't know I don't
know how about sound guys house it's
actually I listened to back to it the
last time and it was like it blotted it
out and peeked everywhere
oh Jesus are you trying to bring the
game down but I'm not sure I don't know
if it worked or not
so tales from tin can zero of 10
everyone said it sucked not enough echo
okay alright we'll work on the echo
alright we'll work on the reverb portion
we're still working out the kinks so a
really cool article from NASA actually
about the wheels that they're making for
their Mars rover and in fact they have
an entire special page on it that you
can scroll through talking about the
history service that they've made
they've sent to like the Moon and Mars
before and the various attacks that have
gone with when it comes to making the
wheels because obviously can't just make
a big rubber wheel like I could do here
on earth because there's a lot of other
harsh conditions that it has to deal
with your space wheel it's got to be a
space well flat I'm in need filling so
what they're developing is actually
being sort of called like a chainmail
wheel so it's got a it's got a bunch of
chains connected together this one has
sort of an internal structure as well
that holds everything out during the
mid-2000s they developed what they
called a sprint tire just an airless
compliant tire consists of several
hundred coiled steel wires driven into a
woven into a flexible mesh the Mars
rover which we follow a little bit the
Curiosity rover actually had some damage
that was recorded and it actually sent
back in pictures of its wheels and it
did not use this type of wheels so this
is the stuff that developing for the
next Mars missions whether you're
talking about Rovers being sent there or
actual
do you know what the issue is with
regular rubber wheels like yeah they
break down there to suffer through the
harsh environment so they can
deteriorate too easily and they're not
capable of dealing
with rolling over like rocks and harsh
terrain and stuff like that so the
solution they have right now and the
fanciest thing that they're they're sort
of publicizing is using nickel titanium
which has a sheep memory alloy so
basically it can bend out of sheep and
then it will snap back into shapes so
that means it can deform to go over
different objects and that kind of thing
and it's it's just kind of cool-looking
that's cool and it's really cool I
spotted this earlier this week they have
a few videos on this the wheel and
actual between in action rolling over
different like it's very like malleable
kind of conform so it's rolling over
they're looking for sort of a cross
between you know the all-terrain
capabilities of rolling over a bunch of
different types of one of rocks and
whatnot being incredibly durable yeah so
that you know there's it can't you can't
pop or anything or get holes in it and
and also the ability to get deformed and
then snap back into shape
so pretty cool and again this website is
nasa.gov slash special-sauce wheels and
even has sort of a close-up of the
atomic structure that sort of can bend
this is this is the end game for your
your classroom science project oh yeah
right all right we've got some rocks and
you guys are gonna have to build the
wheel some things with wheels I can go
over the rocks go you have one week this
is what NASA's this is a nasa nasa level
it's like one kid who comes up with this
stuff and it's like what jesus you
should we need to send you to the
special-purpose graduate you immediately
yale alright sweet what is your baby
Voyager one is the farthest man-made
objects from earths in fact i believe it
is the only extra solar system their
object man-made object that has traveled
outside of its solar system and even
thirty seven years after it was last had
any manipulation or changing course done
Voyager one
just fired its thrusters once again in
town which is pretty crazy
yeah very intentionally it was first
launched in 1977 it is the most Walter
Everett's travelled spacecraft ever
launched by NASA
it relies on attitude control thrusters
to orient itself so it can communicate
what there is earth using the Deep Space
Network they noticed diminishing returns
with the thrusters since 2014 when they
needed to fire it more often to give out
the same amount of energy so to extend
the life of the mission the researchers
came up with a novel idea of
reactivating the crafts trajectory
correction maneuver thrusters and they
were basically fired up in order to
extend the life of the mission for just
a few more years so it's still Voyager
actually has a wide there's a collection
of different sensors and other objects
are attached to it do different jobs
some of them are still working and some
of them have end-of-life so the article
from futurism has a little bit more
information on that as far as the
sensors and whatnot on Voyager that are
still sending information back to earth
but boys are ones like our alien feeler
yeah right like that like it's the
furthest thing away from Earth that we
for this thing we ever made it's also
the thing that it's got the little gold
placard on it that has some of the base
so the the it's got a very fundamental
set of information that's meant to
communicate certain stuff to as long as
many they can it's good it's got
like the human anatomy and yeah there's
yeah there's a few other things on there
as well yeah that's pretty cool thought
that was interesting especially that's
something that was built and launched so
long ago
I mean 1977 that's 40 years right yeah
yeah 40 years um and and yet we can
still communicate with it and it's still
it's still getting some work done
Craig Gray all right SpaceX is working
on their big old rocket so the Falcon
Heavy and in fact they've been doing
some tests on it and Elon Musk tweeted
earlier this week that they're actually
planning to do a test launch and when
they do a test launch for something like
this there's a relatively high chance of
failure that the things just going to
explode or something like that so they
put a payload in it that's just there to
be dead weight which means that they can
choose whatever they want for the
payload and in fact they've chosen some
some unique stuff in the past and I'm
forgetting what actually they did so
they did but but they're promised not a
puppy but the what they're promising to
send up and the Falcon Heavy is a red
Tesla Roadster at least according to
what Elon Musk tweeted blowing up there
was apparently some confusion between
what the what he told the verge on
Saturday and what some email said but he
has confirmed that the plan is real and
that the Tesla payload is real he wanted
it to be playing Space Oddity by David
Bowie which is which is very appropriate
yeah ground control to Major Tom and
every core and the Falcon Heavy would
send the Tesla into orbit around Mars
assuming it didn't explode it would
potentially be in deep space for a
billion years or so if it doesn't blow
up on a cent said Elon Musk and yeah
that's kind of cool
cheese yes I'm sorry that's what they
sent up in the the the original dragon
cheese yeah just cheese
they were inspiring to buy he's
suggesting of a trend of her friend and
British comedy group Monty Python's
cheese shop the sketch so the dragon
spacecraft stem demo flight in 2010
carried a giant wheel of French Gruyere
cheese graters good aliens will love
that super tasty yeah career
so yeah I guess nice if you really want
a Tesla Roadster go into space and just
snatch the one that they're deploying
out today yes I don't know three viable
like what so obviously we don't know
what's gonna happen in the future but
like what if what if 500 years from now
like the Tesla orbiting Mars is like
some you know but like monument or
something like great better
cuz I mean yeah I mean yeah colonizing
Mars is a pretty there's a pretty big
deal and be making humanity multi-planet
species and everything like that and we
don't know if this is gonna be leading
up to that or what or whatever um like I
watched I watched some of start of the
the Star Wars Discovery Series which I
don't think you've watched but like at
one point they made some reference to
Elon Musk which was very like oh like
he's a very pioneering individual and
like I don't want I don't want to
lionize someone like that while they're
still alive or anything like that but it
would be kind of fun if if a Tesla going
around Mars in the future with some sort
of significant object or something like
that yes yeah all right lastly on the
ISS apparently they have pizza night
movie night yes and they celebrate with
pizza Domino's Sen Newsweek has an
article that is not a pizza it's a pizza
flying across I thought that was a safe
space I was like is this not is this
can't be as well as a time-lapse of them
preparing the pizza and cooking it so
much mozzarella just floating in the air
that's what I'm confused about right
like it's not it's it's not zero-g but
it's very low gravity that's all the
things right on stuff yeah you usually
see you know and the movies everything
squirts around and you get a little blob
something everywhere but they're
apparently able to do too well doesn't
look like I have cheese I'll fix it's a
pizza they also cut it with scissors and
I didn't really see people eating it but
this is kind of funny to think like if
you're eating a meal in space like you
don't really need a table or anything
like that it's just you just kind of
funny you know they're like you eat it
and then yeah yeah float in front of you
or whatever anyway I thought that was
coming to the dining or the music on the
dining air exactly yes area and but good
to know that on the ISS they also get to
have pizza night from time to time yeah
all right so uh
Shakey's Shakey's got a hit a hit up fit
of the space
hey given how little research I did and
how few notes I had I think we got
through my
stories well enough so hey cheers Cheers
we are done with that you drink beer
than I did I did
you were talking more drinking more hmm
cool are we doing donations yes we're
gonna jump over to donations and QA so
all right Josh Rowe well 6000 cystic
sense book yeah looking to make a killer
ITX built I remember back in the day
that disabling hyper-threading will
lower temperatures and power it's still
a thing a yes you got to not be to a
degree that I would recommend doing it
how you're threading with it's typically
something that you want to leave on the
only reason you might want to disable it
is to set up some sort of a speculative
scenario where you are trying to
purposely hamper the the chips
performance artists making a comparison
or something like that yeah no leave
happy thirteen oh man yeah leave it it's
yeah just leave it on n be 67 30 bucks
congratulations on surpassing seven
hundred thank you Congrats
thank you I just realized that you you
passed 700 did I almost didn't realize
either I think it happened on Saturday
yeah and I wasn't really like it just is
one of those days where I just didn't
really look at social media at that all
day so yeah thank you NBC 7 yeah I'm I'm
up over 700 K I don't have a 700,000
subscriber giveaway plans but I think
I'm gonna do one at 750 how much rain
you know probably I mean another month
or so we'll wait till then yeah there's
a million seems like a good option and
in the meantime like we've already
mentioned we've got the I don't know did
we do the prepper and that's when I'm we
didn't I don't think so we can do an end
end announcement where we're doing a
charity livestream for 12 hours we're
gonna count are gonna be gaming and
live-streaming right here in about four
days on Saturday December December 9th
so mark your calendar you'll be able to
donate the donations are gonna go into
charity but for people who donate we're
also gonna have two computers and we're
going to do a drawing at the end of the
the end of the day to give away both of
those computers yes if you donate money
you'll be entered into the raffle to win
one of the two computers yes and they're
gonna be pretty epic computers so you
guys finally join us from the stream
mine is the one I already built is worth
no $1,900 eight hundred nineteen hundred
dollars it's a very nice system very
great gets you into the high-end desktop
and even platform look you guys alright
be able to see us gaming which is always
fun
Fred rants with the $50 donation follows
did your wife enjoy the 43 inches you
gave her the other week Fred does very
very I like the way phrase that yes
actually
I gave it to her last night damn to be a
little bit more specific
I bought some Fred's talking about a 43
inch Dell 4k monitor oh that I bought
god I got on Black Friday it was an
Amazon lightning deal for $650 and
actually yesterday I did an unboxing
video actually I did I did I did a haul
video that'll be up on it and another
day or two of all the stuff that I got
for Black Friday and Cyber Monday
unboxed it actually wouldn't installed
it on her desk last night and it's crazy
huge but she's going to just that one
single monitor and since its 4k and it's
so big like she likes it so she's been
pretty happy with it she's she was doing
some Excel work on it for like her work
work stuff and she loved so many cells
she can see in the Excel spreadsheet and
then she was also playing some some
World of Warcraft and some overwatch and
she was really loving it so I think
she's a that gives you a competitive
edge in certain games I was like yeah I
feel like the people everything you
should be easier to shoot because it's
bigger yeah yeah it's much yeah great
instead of a tiny head that you're
aiming at it's like a freaking that's
Lauren large so that makes sense but
thank you for headaches P Rex Scott
Dilbeck thank you for 666 donation
thanks guys for the honorable mention
i'm pimp my pc paul are we going to be
seeing your HTPC finished before
christmas Scott
I don't want to promise anything I will
try but I don't want to promise anything
I I will try I really can't say he's
doing his best guys I fast I see the
potential for me having time to do it
it's just a matter of how the next
couple weeks ago I think because it's
really one of those projects that I've
had ready to go to the next step on but
I don't need to because the system is
functional as is right now so it's been
easy to keep pushing it back and pushing
it back that's that's really what's what
it comes down to for that but I know
what you mean
I do want to move into the next step on
it and there is there is there is a
potential there's definitely potential
for me to get it done before before
Christmas I'll try I'm making Sandra
Kiwi crypto 12 20 bucks no comment
thanks Cuba cook Thank You QE Jamie
Snelling for the five GBP differences on
a fancy SLI bridge and a plain bridge
that comes with the motherboard would
have bought from store but shipping was
$22.50 to the UK so whatever so Jamie
the only time you're gonna deal with a
potential incompatibility issue with an
SLI bridge is if you're talking about
the most recent generation of GPUs or
Nvidia the gtx 1070 and 1080 and 1080 TI
those require what's called high
bandwidth sli bridges and the difference
when you're looking at the fancy more
expensive ones and the cheap kind of
flexible ones this actually has to do
with the traces going from point A to
point B and then needing to be able to
exchange data at a very high frequency
with enhanced precision so the rigid PCB
ones have very specific layouts of the
length of the trace from point A to
point B which enhances the amount of the
time that it takes to go from from point
A to point B which enhances the
precision which is what makes it
compatible with the latest NVIDIA GPUs
if you're going with 900 series or
anything before the flexible ones work
just fine but yet if you are going with
the current generation and the I'm sorry
nvidia sli
configuration definitely want to get an
HB a slide breech yep that one said
Jeanne Snelling oh I'm sorry
Thomas drilling $5 try a couple of
Boilermakers next show I want to see you
guys pass the out
Boyle makers Boilermakers Boilermakers
what's that I believe I get a double
check ever gonna be wrong about no idea
what a boilerman you believe look that
up I'll go on to Ballentine for the 12
canady years May the prices below in the
frame rates be high we couldn't agree
more thank you very much Ballentine Dave
Fredrickson $5 same thing I said in the
other half you guys are awesome
following since new eggs yoked number
one nice oh cool thank you Dave nice
dude Boilermaker I was right is a shot
and a beer shot in a beer
typically is an expensive beer with an
expensive whiskey okay in Texas it's
known as a two-step a two-step in
England the term Boilermaker refers to
half pint of draw of draught mild mix
with half pint of bottled brown ale okay
so it's a shot of whiskey and some beer
right after nice yeah well that's a -
our whiskey next mega detects all order
a boilermaker beer is either served as a
chaser or mixed with the whiskey mixed
oh yeah I knew the chaser just just give
me a shot of whiskey and a beer we
should do an Irish Car Bomb episode
which should yeah essentially be the
same thing when it comes to alcohol
intake that's true Dingle on the $45 you
guys should play near automatics awesome
if you love it play Bayonetta vanquish
and it'll cure rising rising their games
are intense you said that near was
pretty decadent yeah it's one of those
games that I don't think was like
necessarily a mass like a widely
advertised triple-a title that everyone
has heard of but I've heard of it
multiple times and references like this
was a really good game this years yeah
cool I should check this out as it goes
thanks for the recommendation Craig
Pettigrew for the 5k viewers as you
Peter your brother Peter Pettigrew get
it Pettigrew I don't know
Harry Potter sorry I'm not a Harry
Potter nerd escapes a baron his finger
that's always left his finger sorry
Craig
I heard you guys gamers Nexus and J
helped me build and overclock my first
budget computer arises at 1,300 X a 33
320 m don't judge me lol 550 watt PSU 8
gigs of hyper X Ram r9 380 4 gigabyte
that's a pretty solid system I for it
for his budget entry-level computer
you're eventually gonna want to upgrade
your motherboard you and I motherboard
yeah cuz a320 can overclock you can't
overclock it's not gonna have good power
delivery even if you like even if you're
to upgrade from a 1300 X to like an 1800
X or 1700 it's not gonna be able to
maintain a high clock speed on those
GPUs for a long period of time that'll
be your that'll be your weak point but
oh that's it you've got a nice balanced
system for now yeah but you will
probably want to upgrade that
motherboard if you're planning to
upgrade the rest you see even more so
reason to do so with Verizon tube being
now confirmed of support aim for exactly
that's awesome
then Woodward for the 10 bucks building
first PCB game and stream and didn't
realize my choices may be good for
gaming but not necessarily for streaming
asus strix 270 ei7 7700 KO gtx 1070 will
the setup suffice thanks for streaming
yes so you have hyper-threading on that
7700 k you should be fine you should be
fine some gamers nexus in particular has
tested these configurations and actually
found this is 77 or k simply because
it's limited to 4th 4 cores and 8
threads does lag behind when it comes to
the stream quality if you compare it to
say a 6 core AMD option on the am 4
platform that said you have the 7702 k
which means that you have an internal
GPU that has an h.264 and i believe in
h.265 you some hardware encoders so i
would suggest that you use take
advantage of that again there's further
developments with stream quality and
that kind of thing but yes you can get
by with gaming and streaming with the
7700 k and you're not gonna suffer that
much but I would Rick
and taking advantage of quick sync for
your stream encoder that would be a good
option for you definitely do some ap
comparison testing with with quick sync
and also with the native encoder the
h.264 encoder that comes on the GTX 10
series cards I mean if you have a 1070
you might as well check out what the
difference is there I mean it kind of
depends on the rest of your hardware
setup and what an EMV encoder yeah so
you can use GPU or CPU I would say take
a look at both and see which one works
better for you in my personal experience
of 7700 K I have not tested it directly
against it's like the like six or eight
core Rison chips but I haven't really
noticed any significant problems with
the quality when streaming and that was
probably like 3500 kilobits per second
1920 by 1080 30fps if you want to scale
upwards of that then you like like Paul
said gamers Nexus does verify that the
performance might not be as smooth
beyond those settings but yeah just go
ahead and check it out for yourself
thank you very much for the input though
HX fear no fish XG $5 I decided being
ugly in fear no fish I decided that
impulse buy a 10 year old Quadro FX 3
700 just to say that I have a Quadro
that being said any ideas what it could
be hust for so you bought a Quadro just
to say you have Quadro you have no idea
what to use it for workstation
applications 3d modeling 3d rendering
video editing a lot of these things that
you could do with a gaming GPU hopefully
you're not trying to gain with a Quadro
that's not the most ideal I have 3700
G's I would say I mean your CPU and your
GPU unless you're just sticking to a
workstation system but even that's
functional as a video card and giving
you a video outs and everything like
that all the quadroon years old there
would be much more viable and powerful
options even there two or three years
old right now yeah for your solution so
I mean I would I would keep it as a
vanity piece or you know put it in a
display case or something like that yeah
you see what I would do ZZ hearty 10
Australians I for one welcome our new AI
overlords hey we honor them yes I
respect them because that's it's either
disparagingly of them and therefore they
should treat us with kindness and
respecting robots we trust
Zachary Hummel $20 no common thing
Zachary love you appreciate it Fred rant
fit $5 I believe you take you for a
really AI and not real you are here to
set us all up for destruction you know
that's gonna become like a perfectly
legitimate question like right now I
went online just a robot no but I like
for real right now robot right now you
look at something like a Twitter feed or
a you know a social media feed or
something like that and you see stuff
that's posted and you wonder like is
this news article written by a Bob
there's lots of new news articles that
are written by a bot can you gather the
information and put them post it they
can make in that metal is Twitter post
being written by a bot we're gonna come
to a point where we can see videos and
we're like is this a real video I'm
watching that real people made and are
talking to me or is this a 3d generated
video that was made by an artificial
intelligence base like that on a bunch
of deductions of what people want to see
that should be a law if something's made
by a robot it needs to explicitly say
that so we know like a human didn't make
this I would actually be ok with that
but honestly that's gonna be a thing
because as AI gets more and more
intelligent and as its applied towards
things like selling products and
something like that all they really care
about is eyeballs that's all that's all
that's all that's being sold when you're
watching TV or watching ad-supported
visibility something like that how many
eyeballs are watching those ads that are
being shown so pitting giving AI the end
goal of like hey make content that
people are gonna watch and knowing the
AI is either ative and can build on
itself and can become much more
intelligent building on itself then that
takes its fun out of it yeah what
solutions are being directed by that's
gonna be a concern like whatever you're
watching is like is that real or did an
artificial intelligence creative build
that because they knew it would make me
watch it for a half an hour
from all the machine learning the
precision and they could do it better
than a human could but the porn is gonna
be awesome so I oh I'm on some okay with
we we have we have built the case
suddenly coming soon you know what I
mean
all right cue Kiki Kiwi crypto 12 $20 no
comment thank you very much thank you
hit it sir pair a slots $5 caching some
of the show for the second time in a row
real awesome bits of tech this episode
here take my money did you cover the
razor phone bets a little bit old news I
think we covered that probably a couple
episodes back we've discussed it we
neither of us have actually done
hands-on with it or used it or anything
like that
actually I we were hanging out with our
friend who also happens to work at razor
a couple weeks ago and the thought
occurred to me to be like hey hook me up
with the razor phone but it sucks when
you're friends with someone like that
because you don't wanna just be like
make it all about working stuff yeah so
I never did but yeah it does I mean a
lot of people especially I've heard
effort lots positive things about 220
Hertz display and write smoothness and
knee and all that kind of stuff maybe
we'll find a way to get it on one of our
channels at some point seems very
promising though leo el primo $10 Paul I
know it sucks talking about net
neutrality to think but thank you guys
think it will negatively affect PC
building gaming and crypto mining should
I even build a gaming PC great content
guys uh leo I mean say so the the
negative effects potential and this is
obviously you know a speculative thing
this is something that could happen when
it comes to gaming pcs in particular
would be your internet service provider
deciding that hey we want to segment the
data packets that you're sending and
receiving and we want to make sure that
your you know basic internet stuff is
here and that's what you're paying for
we have decided that we want to create a
separate tier for gaming packets so if
you want to communicate with Steam
that's a separate tier we're going to
block that unless you pay for the
separate tier of data now we have no
idea if that's going to happen
it's it like it it didn't it didn't
happen back in 2014 but it maybe was
leading towards that it's something that
could happen without rules that are
explicitly preventing Internet service
providers from doing that they could and
if you're in happen to be in a situation
like about fifty million households of
American in America are where you only
have a single internet service provider
that's a wired broadband connection
that's 25 megabits per second or better
then if your ISP decides to do that and
then I Kate you need to now pay us an
extra 10 bucks a month for gaming
service yeah you're kind of Sol right
and whether you got a pay or not game
yeah and again that's a specific
scenario and it may or may not happen
and it's maybe a little bit further out
there as far as what could happen in the
next few years but if you look at the
way ISPs operate and the way that they
try to make as much money as they
possibly can and if you look at the way
that you know your basic cable packages
have worked for the past definitely
there for years you can totally see that
happening absolutely
and thank you we have we have tried to
discuss this and spread as much
information as we can I do have another
video again that video with Wendell and
a few days coming up so hopefully you
guys like a podcast type thing we just
um just shooting this year so back and
forth Brendon car which who is one of
the one of the five remember what the
term is there's five FCC people yeah
dude-- members I'm voting voting parties
or whatever um he's one of the five and
he he's very much on the edgy PI side of
it where he's tweeting a lot of stuff
that's like don't worry we don't need
net neutrality and like we'll just make
the ISPs promise to tell people what
they're doing and everything like that
so he's tweeted a very specific list of
things which he was calling myth versus
fact which I found to be very deceptive
and
misleading when it comes to what he was
saying here's the myth that like they
want you to believe it he's the fact
about it whatever and like old egg
filled Comcast is awesome and like
they've never blocked people and stuff
like that I mean actually a lot of this
is yeah a lot of this is a lot
of very misleading flat-out lies or
completely just deceptive or that kind
of things so sure that was kind of the
premise of it so Wendell and I spent
gosh my my video is probably a good 25
to 30 minutes long and his video is
probably a good 40 to 50 minutes long
yeah and we got we went over point by
point all of his facts versus myths and
why did I actually know this is the
truth and we talked about a lot of
references to a lot of legal proceedings
that have gone on in the past 15 or 20
years we talked a lot of about of the
details of title 2 we talked a lot about
the details of the 1996
Telecommunications Act and what that was
supposed to do yeah a lot of the
specific changes of modifications to say
the 1940 34 Communications Act and the
96th Telecommunications Act to make the
regulations fit properly for the
Internet
yeah anyway so we tried to get a lot of
detail there and we try to make sure
that everything we discussed had at
least one or two articles backing it up
for research and that kind of thing so
nice hopefully the resources that and
bored of watching it in the week or so
leading up to the vote on December 14th
people can share or with with people who
aren't familiar with or people can
familiar familiarizing himself a little
bit more with it's just the to you
talking or other other it just mean was
me and Wendell talking done Joe pretty
much yeah
nice so and he's he's super smart so oh
yeah pretty well we all know that he's
probably I right he's probably one yeah
I made a human better than we play and
his name is Wendell so okay great thank
you very much Leo LP mo next we've got
salmon doze of five dollars just
upgraded from 80
3:22 risin 1200 thanks to your advice I
have a tight budget and want to upgrade
from a GTX 960 for gig what card would
be best honestly from a GTX 960 if you
can afford it
wait we have a rising 1200 right now I
would say it'd be kind of wasted on you
to go anything beyond like a gtx 1066
gigabyte model i think that's probably
the highest card that I would go with or
an rx 580 yeah it wouldn't be a big
enough upgrade because like if you
didn't attend 63 gig which you can give
the joiner bucks yeah it doesn't seem
like a big enough upgrade for you so
Kurt hold out for a 1066 gig which will
cost you two 60-ish right now or if you
can find because some of the prices for
some of the the AMD cards have been
coming down if you can find an rx 580
that's in the 250 60 70 $80 yeah yeah
good luck with that man Omar Tyndall ten
dollars I like turtles I do too who
doesn't turtles are awesome look
Thank You Omar my favorite troll m'q
trilling ttyn Aitken a tears do you ever
get stuck with being out of content when
there is no new hardware being around or
is on a dead space in marketing honestly
there's there's often so much new
hardware at least if you're looking
especially in the last year or so that
the time I have when there's not harbor
coming out I'm so focused on like the
projects the other stuff I wanted to do
that wasn't focused around like covering
that new hardware coming out that yeah I
always seem to have plenty to do yeah
it's usually it's usually the new
hardware that's coming out that attracts
me from the other projects that I want
to do to be honest when big launches
come out like I can't do this
special you know comedy thing or the
special you know
sketch or other project you know sort of
off the handle thing we're trying I
think we're both trying to stray away
from just like review after review just
keep things interesting for us and for
you guys and sometimes like this year
has been insane with so many huge
launches like silicon launches with CPUs
and GPUs from from all fronts that it's
been sort of a chaotic and
we've had to like sort of derail our a
lot of the content that we that we want
to do that we have been planning that's
more creative based in place of a lot of
like informative type just like harbor
views that you know we still enjoy doing
but there's been more more of those this
happening this year then then since we
started our channels I think 2017 has
been insane so but yeah we like to keep
it flexible we like to keep both content
pieces coming I next we've got rod nine
zero two six five again rad my
father-in-law $20 per Paul awesome show
awesome show thanks Ronny your I noticed
your half wasn't awesome hey you know
favorite clearly tough love you show
whatever you want to say right righteous
Bruce Isis Bruce Lee I have Argentinian
just built eighteen hundred X fractal
define C tempered glass 1080 P eyes
g.skill Ram x3 70s rock vitality gaming
X not posting on XMP 32 hundred
megahertz 29 33 perhaps only mm if
you're not posting so it's very much
again it depends on your memory and I
would say G skill has quite a few kits
that are compare very compatible with an
1800 X but they're not all the same
some of them use different actual the
actual RAM chips that they use in there
are of different qualities you want the
Samsung B die chips very specifically
also single single rank is typically a
little bit more compatible than dual
ranks so I would double check the
motherboard compatibility chart for your
as rock vitality gaming X I would make
sure that you have your BIOS updated to
the latest of Jesus yeah code for the
motherboard and the CPU as well any
input your timings and stuff your timing
and the voltage of your DDR your DRAM
has to be 1.3 so some time manually and
put all that sometimes XMP setting
for 3200 you know might not work with
AMD but yeah loosening up the timings
just to touch might help you out at
hitting
thirty two hundred but honestly if
you're a twenty nine thirty three over
thirty two hundred twenty and then
thirty three isn't too bad so I wouldn't
I wouldn't be too concerned if you can't
actually hit that thirty two hundred
speed yeah yeah there you go
runner forty nine to ten dollars first
built PCMs I'd be 350 tomahawk rise in
thirteen hundred X of course sir L px
3200 to buy forged kits 800 850 Evo 500
gig SSD and a gtx 1050 TI
how did I do also Kyle one is your Black
Friday benchmarks coming out ah um Black
Friday and benchmarks on the system that
I built on that day should be coming out
shortly I think it's gonna be on float
playing probably within a week or two
actually probably within a week so
YouTube within two weeks cool stay tuned
for that as far as your system that you
set up 1300 I really like your system
UTI very well back you can upgrade your
1300 ex all the way up to an 1800 X yes
ma'am
you've got fast Bram you can upgrade
your RAM from 2x4 gigs to 4x4 gigs to
giving you 16 gigs which is totally fine
for most gaming applications awesome is
really solid SSD so no need to upgrade
that you might find that you outlive
your 1050 Ti at some point but again you
have a very solid core system that would
easily handle a GPU upgrade as well so I
think you're pretty good job there yeah
nice job silent runner
Sebastian Casella 100 Argentine ears
when I turn on XMP to configure eight or
configure my RAM on my asus strix
z2 70 it enables sync all cores by
default should I leave it if I'm not
doing any heavy OC on these on the CPU
which is 77 okay also which Mouse are
you using Paul I I think you should just
leave it at all core because that means
you you're overclocking every single
core of your CPU which is what you would
I like for in most situations is what
you want to do so sync all course is
good yeah and what Mouse are using Paul
if you're talking about right now this
is a rocket in this rocket but honestly
I have a bunch of different mice that
are connected to a bunch of different
systems that I sort of switch at the
time so that this is rocket Neth I
really like this mess was a good one
over here I have a rocket tie on I like
the tie on it's a tie on back there
this right here is a Razer DeathAdder
which is one of my sort of mobile mice
that I move around with a lot I have a
Corsair m65 that I really like a lot um
what's this I have a Logitech Logitech
g600 two wireless mouse that I use for
my laptops it's fantastic
I love it the batteries are doublea's
but I have only changed them out once in
the last year maybe two
that's awesome it's amazing battery life
that's pretty crazy very precise and low
latency sensors as well and then in my
computer back there having my onyx nows
7000 oh so good I have one of those feel
so comfortable I really love that
everything yep super awesome so yeah all
those mice
I like they're good mice blue five seven
my man man for those hey guys great show
I just updated my rig with a GTX 1080
what would you guys recommend to upgrade
on this PC next he gave us an image in
girl ink which I followed and did not
turn up anything except a bunch of
Chinese characters Oh honestly not sure
exactly what to say they're interesting
but honestly 1080 is perfectly fine
whatever CPU you have paired with it
hopefully it's like you know either
a core i7 or Rison five arisin seven on
the upper echelon of those yeah kind of
hard to say without the additional specs
there but thank you very much for the
donation blue blue and finally b.i.g Big
