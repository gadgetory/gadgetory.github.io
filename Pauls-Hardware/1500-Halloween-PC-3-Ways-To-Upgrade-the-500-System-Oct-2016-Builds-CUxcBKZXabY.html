Paul's hardware this is my builds video
for October 2016 and I do these videos
at the beginning of every month this is
going to be a couple parts lists that
you can use as starting off points for
your own builds or you can just you know
build them as I tell you to just right
here now if you're looking for the
actual assembly you should check out my
builds playlist which is linked in the
video description below last month I did
a five hundred dollar build which I just
actually assembled and put the video for
earlier this week so check that out I
actually did a full tutorial from a
beginner's perspective so if you've
never built the system before that is a
great starting off points I do try to
build one of these systems every month
for this month I'm actually going to be
upgrading this system so I'm kind of
making this into a bit of a two-parter
but check out that original build video
if you want to see how that one was done
there is some fan interaction though so
check out the description as well for
links to these straw polls where you can
vote now this was last month's straw
poll and you guys voted for me to do a
mid to high end $1500 gaming PC with
Windows monitor and peripherals which I
kind of did I also tried to combine that
with the spooky Halloween themed build
since it is October so those are your
going to get both of those and then just
because I'm obstinate I also I'm doing
the upgraded $500 build as my second
build although I did three different
versions of it so technically this month
you guys get four builds instead of just
two be sure to vote for next month what
PC builds you want to see in November a
dual system living room build I put that
up there again salvaged build bit built
from the bones of an old system $750
build or a fast this mini ITX build all
right let's dive right into the actual
builds for this month I use PC part
picker for these and again links to
these full things are in the description
so here's my $1500 build I started off
going for something akin to the $1200
build that I did just a couple months
back and then what I ended up doing was
really going for all of the black and
orange parts I could possibly find and
it ended up making the system very
expensive but also Halloween themed so
the black and orange is the Halloween
theme and the spookiness comes from the
fact that a lot of these parts are
really really difficult to find or
grossly overpriced if you can find them
so at the heart of the system is a 6600
K kind of the standby in the 200 to 250
dollar range for a CPU overclockable
quad core from Intel LGA 1151
and then since it doesn't come with the
cooler I chose this enter maxi TST for
TFB K this is kind of a smaller version
the fit version of their black twister
fan the ETS T 40 that I've recommended a
lot so it's a little bit smaller but
still seems to perform quite well from
the reviews I've read so far but I don't
want to use the fan that comes with it
we'll be replacing the fan with special
fans in just a moment now if you want an
orange and black motherboard again very
challenging to find there were actually
a lot of these in z97 gigabyte was doing
a series of them but the only real
orange and black motherboard on z170 you
can get right now is the z1 70 X SOC
force which came out back when skylake
first launched and now apparently is
discontinued or something because you
can only really find it on ebay for like
four to five hundred dollars which is
just ridiculous and if you actually look
at my parts list here it's not listed
because it was not available anywhere
however apart from just going with an
all-black motherboard which you could
easily do and would be much more
reasonable this I wanted to stick with
black and orange so that's why that's
there and that's why I also got confused
as I was going through this parts list
it says 1309 right now but if you add
another two hundred bucks or so for a
motherboard that's about $1,500 they
didn't notice that and then I got all my
parts together and then I realized I
didn't have enough money for a monitor
and all that stuff but hey that just
goes to show that if you're parting out
a system and you're being really really
picky about like color coordinating or
color coordinating everything it can
kind of mess up your price to
performance ratio and it can also make
it a lot more difficult to get all the
parts you want especially if you're
going for a slightly more obscure color
scheme such as orange anyway though the
next spooky part I have listed here is
an avexir core series memory kit now if
Exia I did a video on recently a very
flashy colorful memory can be a little
bit expensive this is only 75 bucks for
a 16 gig kit but this is not the right
one I link to the red version but they
do have this available in orange this is
the core series this is actually a ddr3
kit that's shown right here but I've
been told by a vex ear they're also
doing the core series of ddr4 but really
really hard to find especially in the US
but it's black with orange LEDs and I
just that's that's just what I would
want to go for if I was building the
system so there you go anyway for a
graphics card the gtx 1070 this is from
gigabytes the 1070 g1 gaming
card has again like with orange and it's
a very nice well-designed card for a
little over four hundred dollars so you
can actually get a ten seventy for a
little less than four hundred bucks now
but this one's only a little bit more
expensive and this one's actually pretty
well built for power supply one with the
C Sonic mainly because I'm tired of
using EVGA power supplies and all of my
build recommendations see Sonic is
freaking awesome when it comes to power
supplies and samely stable really
well-built this one you have to pay a
little bit more for them though to get
like all black cabling and stuff like
this one has they have some more
reasonably priced 80 plus gold rated
power supplies but the cabling isn't
that great and I didn't want to make
this too spooky with with ketchup and
mustard cabling anyway for the case I
want with the NZXT phantom this is the
new egg version which is orange and
black and I've actually built in this
system are built in this case before
does support the ATX motherboard so it
would support that gigabyte motherboard
if you could find it and I felt like you
know for black and orange this one works
really well I was also really close to
choosing a be quiet power supply I'm
sorry it be quiet case for this one
because they have like the silence
series that I have over here those are
also black and orange and also a good
option the ones I found were just a
little bit more expensive though so I
went with this one now for fans I chose
for extra noctua fans to add to this
system build as you can see right down
here at the bottom if you buy these
straight up and these are the industrial
ones that are actually brown on the
corners they are about twenty to
twenty-five dollars each which is adding
another eighty two hundred dollars to
the system build cost but what I really
wanted to use with the Linus tech tips
additions as demonstrated here by Luke
which are orange and black and they're
also knocked to a fan's which means
they're awesome but these are just
they're sold out everywhere they rely on
is tech tips special editions and
they're gone so I don't know maybe I
could hit up Linus directly and get some
for myself but probably not so anyway
there's my spooky Halloween build again
Halloween cuz it's black and orange and
spooky because you probably can't build
it yourself let's move over to something
more reasonable though this is my five
hundred dollar budget gaming PC which
was one of my system builds for last
month's September builds and I've
actually assembled this now although I
did slightly change some of the parts so
I changed up like the memory for
instance and I did go while I ended up
with a different
our supply but that was simply because
that's what Amazon sent me
I ordered the 450 they sent me the 700
now what I wanted to do with this one
was provide an upgraded version of it
but there's different ways that you
might go about upgrading a system like
this if you're buying all the parts
outright right now I would not say to
start with this and then buy the extra
parts I would say buy all the parts you
want and spend more if you're starting
out with this and you buy this now and
then upgrade one upgrade in like a month
or two then you might consider the other
system parts list that I recommended
here so I have three versions of this at
nine hundred and fifty dollars at seven
hundred and seventy dollars and at seven
hundred and forty dollars I've basically
swapped in a different processor a
different graphics card and then at
least for this one the more expensive
one whoops wrong one at least for the
950 dollar one I also upgraded the power
supply because i went with the gtx 1070
which does have a 500 watt power supply
recommended limit now I'm just going to
mainly stick to PC / picker on this one
because I want to be able to show you
the i-5 6500 is a great upgrade to a
quad core that's what I actually have
right here and that's what I probably
will be doing the system build upgrade
with now the 6400 is very very similar
to this but you can get it for about 20
bucks less the main difference is that
the frequency that it runs that out of
the box is lower for the 6400 so the
6500 will be a little bit faster if only
we could still do non kc pu overclocking
without having to worry about the using
an old bios and not having turbo boost
and all that stuff it would make the
6400 kxt 400 the clear choice but um
anyway i also upgraded the motherboard
with this one to a z170 board because
honestly if you're buying a $500 PC it
makes sense to go with a be 150
motherboard out of the gate because
you're going to save 20 30 40 bucks that
might make everything fit within your
budget a little bit more if you're
buying outright say a 700 to $900 system
I think it's worth it to spend a little
bit more money on a z170 board this is
also a gigabyte board that's going to be
a little bit higher quality than that as
rock one still has four dimm slots still
has an MDOT two but again it's just like
twenty to twenty-five dollars more
expensive but z170 means you can
overclock if you were to again upgrade
your processor to a 60
600k a 6700 K or one of the KB Lake
processors which are supposed to come
out in January or February assuming of
course the gigabyte does an update to
this motherboard to support that anyway
I've used some parametric filters which
I haven't done in my build parts list
very much because I like to say here get
this specific thing but the parametric
filters are very useful on PC part
picker basically you can use the filters
on the left side here to drill down to
kind of what you want so I chose DDR 420
420 666 I wanted a 16 gig kit 2 by 8
gigs and that was pretty much it
everything else it's going to use the
automatic compatibility filter for the
motherboard that I chose then you just
sort by price over here and you can
choose inexpensive memory honestly any
of the memory down here in the 60 to 70
dollar range will work just fine but you
will want to click in on each one to see
what it looks like because that's one of
the problems of the parametric filter is
you don't always know exactly what
you're going to get it's just based on
the current pricing so you know this
might not look that great for you so if
you're if you're shopping for these use
that parametric filter but drill down
into a little bit and choose just the
one within this range that you find
works best for you and as long as you're
getting a 2 by like a 2 by 8 gig kits of
ddr4 memory and it's 2426 66 you'll be
totally fine alright still sticking with
the same solid-state drive at 240 gig
this is a really good deal on a data and
I keep talking about this one other 240
gig drives costs like upwards of $100
and they're really not that much faster
if you're talking about a SATA Drive I
again used the parametric filter here
for the hard drive because I wanted to
include extra storage and that's
definitely something you should start
out with you can get a one or two
terabyte hard drive for really cheap but
this is something that I would highly
recommend seeing if you have lying
around first because a lot of people
have old desktop computers or even an
old laptop that you can pull the hard
drive out of just pull it out reformat
it and pop it in your system as an extra
drive save yourself 40 or 50 bucks to be
used on a different part of your system
other than that I kept everything mostly
the same still the same fractal design
core 1100 case I did add an extra fan
because if we're upping the hardware
inside we won't want a little bit more
airflow in there what just was a really
simple King 120 millimeter and then also
again
just upgraded the wattage on the power
supply by 50 watts to 500 watts to make
sure that we have plenty for that that
for the graphics card the gtx 1070 and
also there's a mail-in rebate for this
GP right now that makes it and this
power supply that makes it 30 bucks all
right so that is the system upgraded to
a 6500 kit a 6500 and a 1070 with a
couple other changes coming in at about
nine hundred and forty-two dollars now
if you were doing the upgrade from the
system to the system there are two
things you should well mainly one thing
you should keep in mind which is that
your existing CPU and your existing
graphics card you will need to cash out
somehow so you'll have to need to take
into account selling those or you know
giving them away to a friend or just
biting the bullet on that and you know
taking a loss but most people like to
kind of recycle those and get a little
bit more for their money like I said I
did two other variants of this so this
is a one coming in at 770 dollars if you
buy all the parts straight up this is
still sticking with the 6500 for the CPU
same motherboard this time again the
parametric filter for the memory so get
whatever the heck you want same storage
configuration I again have added that
hard drive but feel free to leave that
out if you have one that will drop
another 43 dollars off the cost of this
build one with the GTX 1066 gig and in
this particular build which you can get
for around two hundred and forty to two
hundred fifty dollars right now and
again the same case power supply and
that added extra fan seven hundred and
seventy dollars is a toll on that one
and then one final version here for this
one I went with the 6400 so again about
twenty to twenty-five dollars cheaper
for the processor same motherboard same
memory same storage configuration this
time I want with that rx 488 gig which
is right in line price-wise with the
1060 so I'm not going to tell you guys
to get one or the other right now I'll
leave it up to your discretion which of
those you want to go with but the main
actual price difference in this one
bring it down to about seven hundred and
forty-two dollars was going with that
6400 processor but that does give you a
little bit more flexibility to use that
money for other parts like getting a
better graphics card for example that's
all for this video though guys I hope
these parts lists have helped you out
and figuring out what you want to put in
your own system build again check out my
bill
this system if you want a step-by-step
guide on how to put together your own
computer I have another follow-up video
coming later this well probably next
week about reassembling this one or
doing the upgrades on it and then I'm
also going to do a full testing video
where I compare this configuration with
the 6100
and the 460 with the upgraded
configuration which is going to be 6,500
and I haven't decided
probably the 480 or the 1060 but leave
me a comment in the comments let me know
which of those you'd rather see I'll try
to do both but I don't know if I'll have
time anyway guys thanks again for
watching this video and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
