3-way radiator support for water cooling
so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is a follow-up to my how to build
an $800 gaming PC and today I'm going to
show you how to set it up get windows
installed and get everything up and
running this is also part of my monthly
builds series every month at the
beginning of the month I part out a cup
of pcs then I build one of them and then
later in the month I test it now this
videos also meant as a refresh of my
most popular video ever which is the
first 5 things to do with a new PC build
which is an instructional tutorial video
for anyone who has assembled a new
computer and then is like what next how
do I install windows how do I set up the
UEFI how do I make sure all the hardware
is working properly so today I'm going
to walk you through all of that step by
step in order to get going you're gonna
need a few things the new PC that you
just built of course all put together
and it's glorious put together Dennis
you're gonna need a keyboard and a mouse
you're gonna need an internet connection
which I imagine you have if you're
watching this video but that's
represented by either this rj45 cable
which is coming over from my home
network or if you have Wi-Fi and a home
router you can connect to that and I
have a couple antenna because the
motherboard I used has built in 802 dot
11 AC Wi-Fi so you will also need
another computer laptop or a desktop in
order to download Windows 10 and put it
onto a USB in order to make a Windows 10
installer and then you will need a USB
Drive in order to win put Windows 10 on
that I recommend an 8 gig drive you
can't go larger if you want just make
sure there's nothing on that drive that
you need to save because it's gonna be
formatted completely also a quick aside
here we are installing Windows 10 today
because it's a gaming PC and this is the
most viable operating for gaming yes
Linux is also a thing and would be
awesome to install to in Windows 10
sucks but I'm not gonna get into that
for now Windows 10 is what we're going
with so I'm just booting the system up
for the first time and did I mention you
need a monitor too I think that might go
without saying but you need a monitor as
well to complete your whole setup for
your new computer as your computer's
booting up you're gonna see a splash
screen and often there'll be some
instructions delete is almost always the
button that you're going to want to tap
that'll let you access the UEFI also
as BIOS which is the old name for it and
this allows you to lease first go in
just double check reality check make
sure everything is appearing so our
processor that I installed is a 1600 X
we can see that appearing here we can
see our memory two sticks of ddr4 four
gigs giving us a total of eight gigs I'm
also going to go over to advanced and
check our storage configuration and here
we can see that both of our drives are
also connected our SanDisk 240 gig as
well as our Western Digital one terabyte
storage drive that's pretty much the
basics just to make sure everything is
working but if you want to be on the
safe side you can go over and load
defaults that'll make sure everything is
default loaded up for the hardware
that's detected and then if you want to
get fancy you can go over here to OC
Tweaker go to your DRAM and you can set
up your XMP settings if the memory that
you got is compatible with the
motherboard and the Rison processor that
you got you should just be able to load
up this XMP settings this memory I'm
using is actually rated 2666 so the XMP
that's showing up is 27 33 that's good
enough for me so I'm gonna hit f10 to
save and exit and then the system is
going to save that and reboot again as
it boots up here we're gonna see a quick
splash screen and one of the things
listed on the splash screen other than
delete to enter the ufi is to hit f11 to
bring up a boot list and from here we
could boot directly from our windows 10
installer but we haven't made that yet
so let's do that first
so that was step one just making sure
all the hardware is recognized and the
UEFI is working and of course some quick
advice on XMP settings and then we're
going to move back to our extra computer
that we brought so I'm just gonna use my
desktop over here plugging in the USB
Drive and here's where we're gonna demo
the Windows 10 installer and put it on
that USB drive again remember that
anything on the drive is going to be
deleted so double check to make sure
that's nothing on there needs to be
saved I'll put a link down in this
video's description to the Windows 10
installer but if you just search for
Windows 10 downloading the ISO file is
one of the first things that pops up we
can see create Windows 10 installation
media so just click download tool now
and that should download once it's
downloaded you can launch it and it'll
pull up this page that starts getting a
few things ready
of course we accept all of these
licensing terms and it's getting more
things ready we want option two here
create installation media via a USB
flash drive
English Windows 10 64 bit are all okay
with us USB flash drive is going to be
our option and here it has recognized
the only USB flash drive that's eligible
that's plugged into this system but if
you have multiple drives plugged in
double check and make sure that you're
choosing the right one next again and
getting a few more things ready hit next
again and it will initiate the download
progress for Windows 10 here you can
take a short break
depending on your internet speed this
might take a few minutes so we now have
our Windows 10 install our USB so I'm
just gonna move this over and plug it in
to our new computer I having a power on
the system and tap that flf f11 button
to bring up the boot menu I also want to
point out that not every motherboard has
a shortcut to a quick boot menu like
this so you might need to go into the
UEFI go to your boot settings and change
your boot device to this USB Drive and
then after Windows installed you need to
go and change that back this method is
just a little bit easier for a quick
boot from our USB also here choose UEFI
for this USB disk that you have just
created
Knots standard USB that'll make sure it
loads Windows 10 in UEFI mode after a
few moments you'll see this screen we're
in the u.s. so we'll choose English us
for everything and hit next you can use
this USB Drive to repair your computer
in the future if you ever have any
issues with your Windows installation so
hang on to it don't throw it away but
for now we're gonna hit Install Now and
then in just a moment it's gonna give us
two options it's gonna give us an
upgrade option or a custom option and
we're gonna want to choose custom but
before that it wants a product key we
don't have one right now so just click I
don't have a product key and then in the
future you can use my windows 10 for $20
video to buy windows 10 product key and
then apply it to your Windows
installation in order to have a full
legit installed copy alternatively you
can not activate your windows and then
you'll always have a watermark down on
the bottom that says your copy of
Windows 10 is not legitimate and it
won't let you do all the personalization
things that you want to for now though
you probably want to stick with either
Windows 10 home or Windows 10 Pro
depending on which license you're
planning to buy in the future I'm gonna
go with Windows 10 Pro for this one more
license terms that we definitely have
read completely and agreed to and then
here's our choice of upgrade or custom I
usually don't use upgrade you can
upgrade but
customs just always the best way to go
this will allow you to do a clean
installation clean installation means
everything that was
potentially on that drive before is
wiped and you have a fresh clean good
spelling installation of Windows 10 and
it's just always the best way to go get
used to a clean installation of Windows
10 and setting it up for the first time
because it doesn't take that much work
and this is like your ultimate failsafe
or if you get a virus or something like
that in the future as long as you have
your important documents saved and
stored on an external drive or something
like that you can wipe everything start
over and you're fresh and good to go I
have two drives installed both of them
have nothing on them but if you are
using a drive that's been used before
you might see partitions listed here if
that is the case you should go to each
one and hit delete on them if you're
having trouble getting windows to
install on your drive go back to my
first first five things to do with a new
pc build video and there i talked about
loading up disk parts in this and doing
it clean on the drive to make sure that
everything is good to go for now though
we've got disk drive zero unallocated
space this is our 240 ish gig SSD 223
gigs formatted so just double click on
that or hit next and it should start
installing so after the files are copied
and the little swirly ball swirls around
the bits and does a few other things
it's gonna pop you up with this screen
here let's start with the region we're
in the US so choose whatever region
you're in and click Next
there's a few other questions that's
gonna ask you like your keyboard layout
we're gonna stick with us you can add an
additional layout here a lot of these
are accessibility things if if you have
a disability or need a special human
interface device you can help set it up
there from there we'll go to connect you
to a network though we have already set
up our Wi-Fi antenna back here and the
Windows 10 installer that we just made
has automatically recognized our Wi-Fi
card so it's picking up our Internet's
I'm gonna skip for now though we'll wait
to connect to the internet after we go
through this initial Windows setup next
we get to choose a name you can put your
name or you can make up a name for your
computer like 800 0 11 $800 0 11 build
sure next it'll prompt you for a
password you should definitely
definitely create a password I'm not
gonna you do one for right now but make
a password because you want to keep your
computer secure next it'll ask you if
you want to use Cortana no no we do not
next it will ask you to choose privacy
settings and here I pretty much turn
everything off this is simply to try to
minimize the amount of tracking
information that Microsoft sends back to
its servers about you you
and keep this on if you want to try it
out but I just like airing on the side
of more privacy and yes there is other
stuff that Windows 10 will send back to
limit read data even if you turn all
that stuff off but it's at least an
initial way to tell Microsoft that you
want them to track you as little as
possible
now we get to wait a few more minutes
and there we go our basic Windows 10
installation is complete and I have just
plugged in the ethernet cable so I don't
have to bother with a Wi-Fi password and
it'll ask you what you want to do with
the network if you're on a private home
network you can click yes to allow your
PC to be discoverable if you want to
network between computers that's
definitely something you might have
turned on the first thing I always do
with a fresh windows install though is
check for updates so if you just go and
type in update in the search bar you
should be able to see Windows Update hit
check for updates and this will make
sure windows is as up-to-date as
possible it'll probably have some
antivirus definitions as well as maybe a
look accumulative update as well and
depending on how new your windows 10
installer USB is you may have more or
less things here to download so here
again we're just gonna give it some time
let it download and install these if
your prompts us to restart we're gonna
restart if we restart we're gonna go
back to Windows Update again and have it
check again keep checking for Windows
updates until you have all the updates
and it says no more updates are
available so Windows updates are updated
here's a few small things that I just
like to do I don't like the people bar
things I remove that I like having this
PC on the desktop for that I got to go
to themes and then you can find desktop
icon settings over here and click
computer that will give us computer
they're our default browser is Microsoft
edge and that has a single use which is
to go to google.com and download Chrome
Chrome will then prompt you to make it
the default browser which you can do if
you want so cool now we got Chrome
installed go ahead and make that a link
then once Chrome's installed I like to
make that a link on the taskbar and then
I like to remove edge so it's not there
irritating me there we go pretty clean
oh and one other thing if you pull up
File Explorer go over here to view click
on options Open File Explorer to this PC
I find to be much easier and then go
over to view and I like to show hidden
files and folders
do not hide empty drives and do not hide
extensions for known file types a I hate
that I hate that windows I wish they
would make that default but there we go
now when does this mostly configure the
way I want it to but we have a brand new
motherboard installed and that
motherboard has some default drivers
that Windows Update installed for it so
if you go up and right-click on this PC
and go to manage we can actually see our
device manager and device manager here
will show us if there's any devices that
don't currently have drivers and
actually Windows 10 has done a great job
here of installing drivers for all of
our hardware if you have hardware that's
not recognized it'll be a little
exclamation point with the triangle icon
over it and that means you might need a
driver for it but just because we have
default Windows 10 drivers doesn't
necessarily mean they're the best
drivers so we're gonna double check for
our motherboard and the graphics card to
see if there's anything more up-to-date
so we're just gonna jump over to the
asrock website for our motherboard the X
370 killer SLI AC and you should go to
the website of the manufacturer and
model of whatever motherboard you are
using if you didn't use a specific one
go to support and then go to download
you'll notice there might be updated
UEFI our BIOS versions here that we can
get but down here we can see
AMD all-in-one drivers and now Windows
automatically installed some AMD drivers
here so if we right-click on the desktop
we can go to AMD Radeon settings we can
click on the settings over here we can
actually see what's installed so the
Radeon software version we currently
have a 17 dot one dot one 17.4 is what's
currently available so we'll go ahead
and download that and then beyond your
chipset which AMD lists as the
all-in-one driver you're probably gonna
want to check for audio drivers
potentially Bluetooth on land drivers as
well but the chipset is really the main
one by default your web browser should
download to the Downloads folder so from
here we can go in these are
file so we'll just need to extract each
one and then we can just run the
Installer executable and each one of
these to update the drivers for whatever
we downloaded the drivers for and
there's also an attitude that 11ac in
cell driver but again the default
windows 10 drivers will mostly work just
fine it's just a matter of getting
updated ones if that's something that
you feel is needed
remember when you install an drivers if
you're ever prompted to restart restart
don't install other drivers do the
restart first you don't want anything to
be done out of order and it's better to
be safe than sorry
now the last driver we'll need is
something for our graphics card and
graphics card drivers are often updated
pretty frequently so we want to make
sure we have what's most up-to-date if
you have an Nvidia graphics card like a
GTX 1060 1070 or 1080 you want to go to
the Nvidia website and video drivers
tell them what you have and then go
ahead and download we have an rx 580 in
here so pretty much the same procedure
look up AMD drivers go to the download
page you can have an auto detector you
can tell it specifically we have desktop
graphics we have a 5 note not 500 series
rx series rx 500 series and Windows 10
64 bit and here we can see the latest
driver I was actually released on the
18th just almost two weeks ago go ahead
and hit download and we're gonna decline
that survey opportunity and when this
downloads in just a second we will
install it and with most drivers it's
pretty much the same procedure you
download the package maybe you have to
unzip it run the installation executable
and then wait a few minutes while it
unpacked some things and does the
installation pretty straightforward all
right guys this computer is almost good
to go like setup so I love the initial
setup for a new build because like it
just it feels so fresh everything is
clean and fresh and there's nothing on
here that doesn't need to be on here but
one last thing you might notice is
missing here is that extra drives the
one terabyte hard drive that is also
installed in the system how do you
access that drive if it is a brand new
clean drive that's just been installed
for that we're gonna go back over here
to manage on my computer we're gonna go
down to disk management under storage
click on that and here we can see our
disk one so it is there it's just
there's no partition on it it needs to
have a drive partition with a drive
number or Drive
letter assigned to it in order for it to
be recognized and show up in Windows 10
now depending on the status of your
storage drive and what it's previously
been used for if you click on Disk
Management it might give you an
immediate pop-up that says initialize
disk and that is if the disk is
completely clean and fresh it's totally
fine if this pops up I recommend
choosing GPT / m vr GPT is a little bit
newer and it's especially required if
you're going with a drive that's larger
than two terabytes but once it's
initialized you'll see this unallocated
space just right click on that and go to
new simple volume and it will take you
through this wizard I probably want to
use the maximum amount of space
available yes you want a drive letter
format it using NTFS I recommend a quick
format but if the drive has been used
heavily before maybe uncheck that into a
full format just bear in mind a full
formats probably gonna take an hour to
two or three depending on the size of
the drive and i usually like to label
the drive something i will recognize
like one terabyte for each now we know
that's our one terabyte storage drive
hit finish and if you chose quick format
it should pop up in just a second just
as it did here and now again we have a
fresh clean open completely empty one
terabyte storage drive so we can load
our games on there maybe create a steam
library if you guys want a little bit
more follow up on this such as setting
up steam check out my three more things
to do with a new pc build it was
actually made a couple years ago but
it's still very relevant for some of
that content especially taking games
from steam that you may have downloaded
on another drive and bring them onto
your new system but guys that's all for
this video I really hope you've enjoyed
it hope you've learned something if you
did definitely at the thumbs up button
share this video if you know any new or
first-time PC builders who want to get
their system set up and they're not
quite sure their proper steps and
procedures to do that rate thanks again
for watching guys and we'll see you next
