in order to enter your capital is you
know as actually to integrate pagan
religion assuming that northern Europe
oh yeah Cupid peg it's not to get to
what nevermind what Cal says if he's not
interested you but definitely don't
listen to that tech slash tourist Cal
store also got the holiday sale going on
and also lots of super super fun
merchandise including awesome heart
murmur trophy by awesome however much
you can do either store and we got these
new gaming desk mats and other merch
with the with this logo on this is the
cool new awesome hardware design glasses
are very nice too also glasses man that
waves kind of messing with me also
glasses such as these that we're
drinking out of today go home stream
you're drunk it's should I well let's
let's update it we'll try something
different next time I want to go back to
hole and you do but I can it be random
so it does a different one every time no
damn stingers technology hasn't advanced
that far yet I don't see random in here
we're gonna we're good with hole for now
alright my speaking of hole let's let's
move well actually that's gonna make it
weird Renee oh no it doesn't matter hey
that's the news oh wait no another
announcement yeah you do I'm gonna be
doing a brief very informal gaming
livestream on Thursday from about 11:00
a.m. to 1:00 is kind of what I'm aiming
for I will tweet about it to give you
guys a little bit more info on that
tweet at the same time on Thursday Kyle
and I will also be announcing the
winners of the three systems Cal's got
to to announce and I got one to announce
that we did the giveaways for during the
charity gaming livestream about a week
and a half ago yep where we raised well
over 20 thousand dollars for the
Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and
thank you again to all of you guys who
participate in that back to news though
starting off with a story about
Microsoft and steam system gaming news
kyle has some gaming news stuff on his
half to I do a better than yours just to
tease tease that so much better I need
to make this window wider this one
doesn't not wide enough gap there can of
that anyway rumor here from this tech
power article is that potentially
Microsoft and steam might be looking to
enable cross play between their services
wouldn't that be nice this is
specifically because there's been a a
leak in the steam not a leak but steamed
beta update people looked at the code in
it trying to say this I feel like if
there was a line here at the top that
got deleted or something never man
wasn't me anyway there's a code in the
beta updated that force team that
specifically refers to F Xbox with Xbox
pairwise ID being present
so which seems to indicate this might be
something for steam to pair a text box
in order to enable cross-play probably
for that like select games not not all
of them I would think yeah I mean I
imagine that'd be something you could
enable or disable depending on the game
you're developing and whether or not you
it was even a multiplayer game sure so
yeah I mean it's pretty pretty basic
when it comes to that I suppose but oh
that's the line that kept deleted at
first I was gonna point out as the
article does at the beginning that
Microsoft has done stuff similar to this
in the fast past if you look at the Xbox
play anywhere initiative where they
combined Xbox and PC gaming granted
those are both platforms that Microsoft
controls because second Windows 10 and
Xbox but sort of continuing down that
path because you can already play like
fortnight like you can play like PC
players can play with Xbox players on
fortnight already yes right so is this
basically just an extension of that
it'll be supported for four more games
fortnight's on the epic launcher which
is a different different software
platform so we're talking about like the
might like games that are launched
through the Microsoft Store what we're
talking about Microsoft's console games
like Microsoft game gaming on Xbox right
I enable in cross play between those and
games that are natively on Steam okay so
yeah all right
it would give Microsoft Access this
team's vast amount of gamers because
steam does have a lot of gamers and
whenever you talk about new platforms
new gaming software that's always what
people say it's like oh well you know I
want to try out this other thing but I
don't have to buy a game on a bunch of
different platforms you know I like that
or I don't want a bunch of fragmentation
so I have like 20 different launchers
that I have to install in order to play
all the games that I want
so there's got to be some kind of middle
ground there but cross-play could be the
answer in some in some respects then you
have like keyboard and mouse players
going up against controller or gamepad
players
yeah seem fair that's that's how that's
how for tonight does it and I don't know
there's some there's some aim can aim
assist or whatever that the there is
always get I've never and also those
tried that fortnight servers can also
pair what will also pair like keyboard
player keyboard and mouse players only
with other keyboard and mouse players
regardless of platform okay so if you if
you do happen to be a console gamer
that's using a keyboard and mouse
somehow you'll get grouped in only
grouped in with keyboard mouse players
so you don't have that unfair advantage
against the game patters that makes
sense
wool the interesting to see how they
handle that and it might vary from game
to game depending on the developer and
stuff yeah this also might be something
that steam would be interested in doing
because as we mentioned last week and as
I there's a stealthily segue into the
next story steam is seeing a little bit
more rise in competition recently from
some potentially viable competitors last
week we talked about epics game launcher
in the epic game store and their
expansion of that
discord is getting in on the game too
discord more traditionally known as a
online
I guess VoIP service or you know allows
you to voice chat voice chat often use
for gaming and live streaming and also
just for people to talk to each other
and hang out but they actually and
integrated a game service into the
discord platform starting back in
October
a fledgling game store it is a heavily
curated selection of indie games and
including games like the breach and dead
cells it currently operates at a pretty
standard revenue split with the game
developers seventy percent to develop
the developers thirty percent to two
discord but in January they're going to
update that and do a 90 percent split
because it seems to be what a lot of
people realize is that if you're going
to compete with steam one of the things
you're gonna need is a pretty impressive
games library right some or at least you
need some good games to oh my god sorry
sorry
you need some good games too I'm so
popular right now I'm so hot right now
just crazy can turn that off or at least
you need some good games that people
like oh I really really have to play
that game
sorry oh good that's good enough idea
that are working according to this Court
CEO Jason citron after doing some
research we discovered that we can build
amazing developer tools run them and
give developers the majority of the
revenue share so the CEO of discord was
like after trying out the 70/30 split
was like actually it doesn't cost that
much to to distribute games
so apparently add an offense so that's a
you're thumbing their nose at Steam or
other game platforms that don't have as
equitable of a split with their
developers and as mentioned last week
epic launched the PC game stirs epic is
currently doing also a more aggressive
cut with the devs they're taking 12% so
this discord 10% deal would just
slightly undercut that or over cut that
depending on which way you're looking at
it so steam currently is 170 30 yes
steam 70/30 I think the question there
is is 90/10 enough for developers hop
over to discord considering that it's
like not an established platform like
steam you might get more revenue split
but if there's no gamers on that
platform buying your game then Mike you
might be way more profitable getting a
70/30 on on a really popular flourishing
platform like Steam yeah so you gotta
you also need to go where the audience
is I'm sure developers are considering
that as well it'll be it'll be tough to
top steam or even you know reach pace or
keep pace with them because they've been
around for so long and they've they've
really been the crown holder for so long
I would be curious - you're doing really
well I'd be curious how challenging it
is to do cross-platform like a
cross-platform game that's available on
multiple platforms mhm you know there
are games that do that right that might
be in the future might be the way but
yeah so I mean if I had Avella / that's
what I want to do well can I just launch
it on all of them and then you know
people could buy it over there if yeah
like I want to buy it here because it
gives the developer more money or buy it
on Steam because that's all they know it
exists I don't know of course and in
that case the the
game platform developer loses because
then they're giving the game developers
the ability to disseminate their product
elsewhere right and so it goes anyway
now that's a tricky situation we can
continue discussing that from all angles
of business but I'd rather not believe
we'd be giving poor advice because it's
not our Forte so let's move on you asked
ballistic missile systems apparently I
was this is almost like its own little
oh joy segment apparently a ballistic
missile systems have very poor
cybersecurity we talked about this we
did on a previous episode well this is
from Friday so we might have talked
about the other thing we talked about
back in October yes
okay this is a slightly different it's
not something similar somebody was
talking up so we talked about the
next-gen computerized what weapons that
are currently developed at under
development at the Pentagon okay this is
slightly different this is the u.s.
ballistic missile the system the u.s.
ballistic missile system which was
investigated by the Department of
Defense inspector general the DA and
they found many cyber security failings
in the missile defense agency that's not
troubling at all these included no data
encryption no antivirus programs no
multi-factor authentication mechanisms
as well as unpatched vulnerabilities
including some going back 28 years the
report was actually put together back in
April and then it was just released on
Friday they inspected five random
locations where the missile defense
agency operates and has placed ballistic
missiles for the ballistic missile
defense system that the u.s. operates
the purpose of the ballistic missile
defense system these are not the
missiles that are going to like like
blow up other countries we have those
two these are the missiles that are
going up to blow up the missiles that
are being shot at us this is the
defensive missile sure yes
launching ballistic missiles to
intercept enemy nuclear rockets the
audit concluded that the army the Navy
and the MDA did not protect networks and
systems the process store and transmit
BMDs
technical information for instance there
was two factor authentication systems in
place you're supposed to have like if
you're a new employee you get a login up
password for your thing and then you're
also supposed to have a common access
card a physical card okay two-factor
authentication sure but at three of the
five locations many users just didn't
enable it and including at least one
person who had been doing that for seven
years IT admins must be fine then at
these agencies also failed systems were
not patched for vulnerabilities
discovered and fixed in 2016 2013 and
going back as far as 1990s the 28 year
old one server racks were physically
unlocked and easily accessible physical
access is also a security vulnerability
and the officials did that consistently
use encryption when moving data between
air-gap systems using removable media at
one MDA location there wasn't even an
antivirus installed so they had zero
intrusion detection I think my agency is
my agency at home has more security
cybersecurity built-in than any of these
movies are the things that you would
assistance they have the best people
like working on like the earth there
must be a bunch of old-timers
you know like back in my day we launched
missiles without the internet probably
yeah I don't know legacies man legacy
systems that didn't need this type of
security before the internet was ever
ever everywhere I don't know the MDA
currently has 104 ballistic missile
locations and they planned to build
another 10 and then as Kyle brought up
at the beginning he thought we had
already talked about this because back
in October the same office the
Government Accountability Office found
the Gao that new next-gen computerized
what weapon systems that are currently
under development at the Pentagon also
featured similar cybersecurity related
problems and were easy to heck so oh joy
yeah that's the other thing I was
looking for at the end of the article is
like and at the end of the article and
they've patched and fixed everything
no just still open for attack just like
nope here's all the problems and issues
now we can no longer defend our stuff
look Allah fischels
at the location blame the issue on their
supervisors who they said failed to
approve a request for the proper
software which they filed almost a year
prior technically would be the
supervisors in Seoul yesterday was
yesterday 16 million 16
my god million views million views
number two on trending so we're probably
not sharing with us with you for the
first time but if we are the videos
linked in the description as long as
well as all the other the articles were
talking about today we've not seen this
video hasn't seen the video so we're it
is a person wait response I purposely
waited to share my genuine reaction for
the first time on stream it's one of
those videos that's that's cool to watch
because you see people who did clearly
in ethical things kind of get there come
come up inside a comment agree but the
dude who made the video is marker over
right there he's a youtuber he is also a
NASA engineer I don't know if he's a
former NASA engineer if he's still a
NASA engineer but he's very smart guy
he's done quite a few cool projects in
the past like he did one where he made a
I can't explain he had a dartboard on a
system that would move and when you
throw the dart the dart board moves so
you always get a bull's-eye Wow it was
just kind of cool so he's got like
little videos way way cooler videos
often he post I don't know he's got four
point six million subs I bet he makes
more money on YouTube than working for
NASA which is just insane I think about
most likely he's got yeah he's got many
subs weeks ago has six point eight
million views a month but these are
these are spamming videos out like we do
he's spending time and making quality
stuff um alright
anyway point being weird quality stuff
sunburst we do Chris we do sure we do
Kyle we shut the up I'm Shane I'm
James you get my point
yeah alright I lost my train of thought
but he had a package store you just
refreshed and it got seven tits at 17
really a jump from 16 million to 17
million while we were in this which is
obviously from all the viewers we just
sent over right now that's thank you we
taken because everyone for the support
there right he had a package stolen off
of his doorstep he spotted on the nest
cam it bugged him a lot because I think
he actually saw the same person come
back a couple times and he wanted to
figure out how to engineer something
that could get back at them so he came
up with the concept to make a device
with much engineering involved that's
basically a glitter bomb sweet
um I will just see it looks pretty young
yeah he's I don't I'm not sure Kyle I I
don't know that much about about him
I've watched a few of his videos this
middle name glitter mark glitter another
Rober anyway so he spent they spent six
months engineering this device picks six
months there there it is we're NASA
money goes hey well it's very it's what
you do with your NASA intelligence in
your spare time so it's got this kind of
structure inside and it's got four
smartphone's attached to it
it's in a box for like a Google home
device or something like that
and then it's got a central control
board that controls everything because
he had multiple problems to try to solve
as he was designing this thing he needed
to make sure that anybody who like he
knew it needed to be able to sit on the
porch for a very long time without doing
anything because he can't run the
batteries out on starter it needed to be
able to detect if it had been picked up
or moved right it has a GPS built into
it so it could find if it's been moved
somewhere also so he could track it down
afterwards right and then it's got four
cameras all with wide-angle lens all
with their own internet plans so that if
he didn't get it back they were
recording and also upset to upload
everything to the cloud so he can
actually extract the data sure and then
yeah the GPS and everything so just a
just a crazy cool design that's awesome
and then with all the cameras on it
basically we're like he's down here
wherever you're at oh and then there's
this this great thing too that's also
integrated into it so at the top is the
glitter bomb that spits out a bunch of
glitter and there's also a fart sprayer
with a thing that activates like every
30 seconds or a minute and it just
rotates and does this nasty fart spray
smell out which is cool too so it also
starts kicking out yeah there's the wait
I'm not showing people go back it just
does this inside the box before it
actually ok sorry guys there's more
seats yeah so after it's activated like
after the Texas something's picked it up
it starts doing the fart spray and then
spray and I see and there's yeah there's
a little activator thing right there
that it kicks that up so all goes in
this little
Google home box and then yet and all the
glitter goes on the little bowl on the
top and when you open it up it's got
triggers this T triggers on the side and
then it spins this thing around and
glitter box brilliant it's just
brilliant so Wow good thing he's also
got tracking going on so he can he can
like figure out where it's where it's
gone and everything like that and then
there's brilliant reactions of the
person like in their car who picked it
up and then just glitter glitter
everywhere and they're like what yeah so
more bright and there's just like no way
and it's I mean and so they pick it up
and they just chuck it in a trash can
and then he knows where it is because
the GPS so he goes picks it up and then
of course they every look at Mike oh my
god packages off people's porches know
what this is yet Wow that's like the
finest it's like the finest glitter - of
course so he gives it to her friend
who's had packages stolen so different
locations different locations saying how
prevalent this because they hope they
diamond issue this is no matter what
neighborhood you're in people steal
these packages people rolling up who
clearly aren't like destitute or like
you know anything just people who are
stealing other people which is a mess
which is very nice people just get a
hard-on for they just get you know the
glitter the glitter is it's awesome and
then everyone gets pissed off anyway so
we don't want to we don't want to show
the whole video here but there's
multiple people multiple your oh that's
so good my brilliance will save it pal
that's the best prank of 2010 a be sure
to look after so wow yeah just just like
a cool video like also kind of makes you
like man people sucks people didn't do
that but hopefully that's I mean with 17
million views you hope that some people
did knock some sense into some people I
mean they stopped doing this yeah I know
not everyone's gonna be convinced but I
think I think people just see it as like
oh nobody saw me do it so I and I got
away with it so you know therefore you
know and maybe they think like oh that
person
have the the package replaced right so
it sent back right but you know they're
stories of people who have had like
medication taken off of their porches
and stuff like that with this which is a
pretty big problem so you know also
joke's on this guy if they kept if they
would have kept the package in like
somehow thrown away the GPS or whatever
because well the GPS was in the phones
right yeah all the phones all the phones
are self-contained so the worst case
scenario is he lose his whole device if
they decided to steal it but right let's
say they would have to like destroy it
or something because the GPS is always
on unless they unless they disassembled
it and actually you know broke some
stuff inside turn the phone even he
would know where it was or know where it
last was or everybody so right but after
that bomb goes off they're probably just
they don't want to get anywhere close to
it so they probably just yeah everyone
just takes it in checks in the trash can
or just throws it one person just throws
another car that's amazing yeah but fun
video all right I'm a fan one more news
story this is about Windows 10 and
Cortana how many of you guys use cortana
cortana cortana cortana
tina katana tomato tomahto not many
people do Cortana is not very popular
when it comes to Windows 10 I was I was
kind of excited when it first launched
it seemed like it would be useful but it
just it got such a bad rap right off the
bat and I think it was soured by a lot
of other poor decisions that Microsoft
made a lot of the stuff coming like like
maybe bleed over from Windows eight
disappointments and certain stuff they
did with Windows 10 that people were
less enthused about because people were
coming more aware of like its eliminated
telemetry you mining harvesting and yeah
it's um but you data being sent back and
core tenant became more of a spy and yes
I think then than anything else like a
helper whereas you have lots of people
who use a Siri or who use Google
assistant on their phone without a
second thought and those do all
basically the same things that Cortana
does when it comes to you know gathering
information from the questions you ask
and about who you are and more effective
ways to advertise to you and everything
well that said though Microsoft does
apparently see the value of having some
level of digital assist
in their operating system so if this
rumor is true and this is definitely a
rumor because this is sourced from a
Twitter thread from a user named suppose
they use solid walking there's walking
cat and there's albacore albacore
because the original that's very service
legit indicating that it may be soon be
possible to remove Cortana from Windows
10 altogether possibly or another
tipster walking cat said that they found
api's concerning the requests named his
system Cortana app replaceable or is
system Cortana app replaced just API in
API calls in the system that seemed to
be related to that they'd replace of
court replacement of Cortana it doesn't
seem like they would name that name it
that if that wasn't what it was supposed
to do yeah there's also albacore also
claims that the apps Cortana hop app
doctor Cortana gorg am I'm really having
difficult difficulty pronouncing my ace
where Tana app dot view and undocking
test app also exists and the titles of
those also suggest that Cortana might
become replaceable or undock Abul and
Amazon's Alexa is all now isn't also now
available to download on the Microsoft
Store so you can get Alexa on Windows 10
not necessarily get Alexa and replace
Cortana with it but um who knows maybe
in the future
sure so that's all that's all about that
story all right yeah all right I have
one more segment to get into and that is
techie of the day after tomorrow
I just lightly changed the format of
this and I've involved a bit of feedback
from you guys so I have a couple straw
polls that we're gonna be sharing in
chat talking about some upcoming
technology and whether you guys think
it's good or not because obviously any
time there's new technology personal
digital assistants or any of the other
things we've been talking about today
there's may be pros and cons to that
maybe there's things that make your life
more you know easier but maybe they also
collect your personal data and
then you get ads that are creepy because
you're like how did they know that I was
interested in those leather pants or
talked about in the last 30 seconds yeah
whatever you might be shopping for so
first tech right here mister man
Ars Technica article this is about a
Kroger owned grocery store that is
beginning fully driverless delivery oh
yeah I got ya then the grocery store
it's actually called Fry's food which is
owned by Kroger who is a giant in the
grocery store industry in the United
States and they launched a self-driving
grocery delivery program back in August
that was using Priuses modified Priuses
that were self-driving the company that
did that is it set up that was called
neuro yeah it's funny is this is very I
feel like this is oh there it is all
right so there's the actual self-driving
this is a new self-driving car not a
Prius it's not even large enough for a
person to be in so like there's smaller
than a smart it is not a vehicle
designed for people it is designed to
deliver food so yeah it's called the r1
custom-built for autonomous deliveries
so people can order their fries food
which is also weird too because I'm used
to fries computer and pewter parts and
stuff do they sell ddr4 order your food
driverless automatic vehicle rolls up
and delivers it that would be convenient
like I need like an 8 gig stick of
RAM it's cold fries I mean they should
get into it eventually I'm gonna put
some links into chat for you guys step
it up yo so you can vote on this and the
answers to these are all this - both I
don't have two questions but they're
both the same
Travis automated grocery delivery you
can choose yes it's the future no it's a
bad idea or I've got an in-between and
in-between response as well because you
know some people tell you you are
lukewarm at Newport okay well before we
go over the responses from you guys
here's the other new technology and this
is a motherboard vice.com article about
people created by nvidia and videos
creating people making them and viewing
them with life and I believe they have
3d printed bodies it's actually not true
this all right so these are actually
just this is a machine learning
algorithm artificial intelligence that
they give them they feed a bunch of data
to pictures of people's faces and then
the people become pictures they're just
they're pictures of people people who
become pictures it sounds terrifying
oh there's pictures of people might risk
of becoming a picture but they're not
really people none of these people
actually exist they're made-up people by
the AI so this PDF just taking a
sweet-ass time to load there's more
pictures in there I was going to show
you guys yeah so all these pictures here
if people that you look at that you'd be
right you just look at that and be like
oh those are all people yeah but they're
not they're all that's insane
they're all fake fake people fake beeps
damn it PDF and it does it take the load
of damp you guys it's your internet so
yeah there's there's a there's an
animation giffy animation of it to talk
about various attributes and stuff that
the the AI can sort of integrate - sorry
more people into other people sub people
so it's kind of creepy I wanted the PDF
to load this is super thing it's like
it's all the way over here but there's
still nothing on screen there it goes
all right so there's a long PDF says
this says this picture which is also
kind of cool look at so yeah like all of
these none of these are people what yeah
that's insane so I'll just create it and
not like created by a person who like
looked at a picture and painted it was
like I think this would look more
realistic created by artificial
intelligence that's so nuts yeah cuz I
mean there's so many like like flaws and
details and skintone and like all this
all this kind of stuff going on yeah so
yeah pretty insane so follow-up question
there what if we saw a picture of us in
there not real and AI generated images
human images that you can't tell from
reality
I don't I have too much into
you know possible outcomes or whatever
like you can imagine already the
possibilities so just some of the
possibilities like the article starts
off kinda talking about that um thing
that I always forget the name of that
can take a existing video and like
replace the face of the person name I
forget what it's called right yeah yeah
making it making it easier making it
simpler making it more accessible for
anyone who has the AI processing
horsepower and this is part of the
reason why graphics cards have really
been expanding into the realm of of AI
and creating deep learning engines and
everything like that
deep bakes yes thank you deep shadows
are always coming through reminding me
of what deep fix is there it is alright
so just getting your feedback on this
what you guys think about the
technologies at URI that's awesome URI
de musica creepy cannery what do we
think about automated driverless
automated grocery delivery
alright so people are kind of in the
middle about this or more optimistic
seems like most people don't think it's
a bad idea only only 17% bad idea
that half people read in the middle it's
probably gonna probably gonna happen the
probably start seeing it's one of those
things like I don't know you remember
when you started seeing smart phones
around for the first time yes back in
the mid-2000s right like it first it's
like a very novel then then gradually it
just became the thing like yeah Luzi bit
kouddous yep probably something similar
to that right there I mean we didn't
dive into the sort of the more the more
negative potential aspect of this which
is that like I believe yea jobs I guess
transportation jobs are like over half
of all jobs is transportation yeah
moving stuff or moving people from place
to place so you know there's that aspect
of it as well but for something that's
more simple like grocery delivery that
does seem like something that you know
the advances of technology could provide
that nice simple experience especially
if you talk about something like where
it integrates fresher food like a lot of
people only have time to go shopping
once a week but you know if you could
have fresh food delivered
a couple times a week then you might
cook more right healthy food or
something
so okay lots of aspects to that but
trying to keep the show shorter so how
about the AI generated human images that
you can't tell from reality I have a
feeling about this one going bad idea
I'm very bad in videos only bad stop it
stop that just and Jenson's next the
quote was from it just works it'll be a
it's just human just just humor they're
just humans they're just people it's
just you alright so obviously people
scary about the going history going very
far past the uncanny valley sale get on
the uncanny valley to the cross the
uncanny River they moved up to the candy
the candy Plains candy mountain Kenny if
beyond the candy waterfall to the candy
the candy caves I made a game about this
I think it's called Kenny land can
Tierney land Candy Land
lovely alright well hey yes Hannibal's
that's all I have for my half of the
show so we're gonna get things off here
thanks all you guys again for watching
if you're watching live on youtube we
will be doing an after party at the end
so if you did any donations donation
comments will respond to those then we
will also got some mealtime packages to
open back here we do in the meantime if
you're watching on twitch stay right
there if you watch on youtube link to
Kyle's half is in the description so
click on that and we will be right back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
