today's video is going to be all about
overclocking non overclockable Intel
processors specifically skylake
processors and if you're wondering how
that's done well first off you need a
z170 motherboard similar to this one
this is e170 extreme for tremaine's to
demo overclocking well not this CPU this
is a 6600 K this one is unlocked so you
could easily do a multiplier overclock
on this what I want to get is something
that gives us a little more bang for our
buck hopefully something that's still a
quad-core something that still will make
for a very nice gaming system for that
I'm going to go for an i-5 6500 but I
don't have one so let's go to micro
sensor could I use micro Center see if
they're playing any of Jays videos 600
k's 6100 there's the 6500 it's weird
that other than the retail pricing on
them right yeah they have retail pricing
okay that's why it's a big healthy stack
of paper 212 Evo's then I might as well
get one
success what's in the bag I managed to
get away with just six oh god it's
bright out here
I showed great self-restraint and I only
came out with my hyper 212 and the 6500
that should be all I need for today okay
I managed to make it back I got my 6500
got my z17 extreme for from has rock out
of the box here I was just taking a look
I figured let's go over this really
quickly before I move on as rock
actually sent this motherboard over
directly so that I could use it to
demonstrate the BC LK overclocking with
non K Intel skylake processors so thank
you guys rock for that I also wanted to
point out that as rock is not the only
one with this capability Asus Super
Micro were two of the other sort of
originators along those those are the
three kind of firsts to sort of bring
this to the forefront I don't know who
was absolutely first but I heard it
first from as rock so put it that way
MSI and EVGA have also followed suit and
I believe gigabyte will be as well so
pretty much all the motherboard
manufacturers are able to enable this
simply by giving you a BIOS update for
the motherboard as a couple things to
point out here one is that the BIOS
update is not typically available
directly via the standard ways you go
like you know go to the motherboard
webpage on a Xerox website go to the
download find your BIOS and download it
you've got to download it from a special
place that's because it does a couple
things to the motherboard and I want to
point those out before I dive into this
one is that it's going to disable turbo
and C states for your processor which
isn't a huge deal to a lot of people who
only care about how fast is it and that
kind of thing but if power consumption
is a concern of yours
it's definitely something to keep in
mind one probably more important thing
to keep in mind is that this is going to
disable the I GPU when you load up that
BIOS so you're going to need a discreet
graphics card you're not going to be
able to use the eye GPU along with this
overclocking method that said here is a
look at the board and the z170 extreme
for is a part of the extreme series so
it's definitely not quite as budget
oriented as like the pro line is
although this is more of a budget series
so the extreme series head there's like
a 3 a 4 a 7 there's a 6 and a 7 this one
goes for about $145 us as of the time of
this video and there was also a $20
million rebate so down $225 after that
mail-in rebate so you can get this
fairly inexpensive you do have a couple
by 16
see i express slots right there so you
can do to a GPU configurations there
tripple slots paste I thought that was
kind of nice it's got a pretty much all
black look there's some copper accents
on some of the heatsink or not the heat
sinks but this little shroud right here
this is a plastic shroud by the way has
a purity sound logo on it and then the
rest of the heat sinks are made of metal
but they're fairly minimalist I mean
fairly you know they're not too gaudy or
anything like that so you can see that
sort of shiny or asrock logo again with
the copper color and then there's a gold
caps also kind of scattered across the
board looking at the upper edge we can
see the vrm heat sinks that are at the
top right here and this is actually part
of the reason why I chose this board I
wanted something that wasn't crazy
expensive I definitely didn't want a top
of line 200 $250 plus overclocking board
but the power delivery is important when
it comes to skylake z170a skylake
processors and overclocking so this has
a 10 phase power delivery these are
niche econ 12 K gold caps in there as
well and definitely not the best when it
comes to overclocking but certainly
better than a lot of the more bare-bones
say hundred dollars and less D 170
options that are out there you also of
course have four RAM slots which is
pretty nice to have and then there's
some other kind of bonus features like
you got a power and reset surface
mounted right there you've got a debug
LED was which is nice to have SATA
Express on all these which I are they
making SATA Express drives I feel like
they must have given up on that you also
have an ultra MDOT 2 port right there
PCI Express gen3 by 4 which is
definitely very nice to have it's not in
my favorite position since it's right
below the primary graphics card slot so
that will be blocked by your GPU
actually very much of a concern if
you're considering water cooling let's
this board but there's probably not a
whole lot of people considering that
lastly here's the IO and a a ps2 port I
don't mind that it's a combo port - you
got six USB 3.0 ports here here and here
and here you also have all the
connectors for your eye GPU including a
full-size DisplayPort and HDMI you've
got your integrated NIC right there
which is I believe Intel based and then
you also have your 5.1 surround audio
and then they've added on a USB 3.1
controller there and they're giving you
a type-c connector as well as a type egg
connector and USB 3.1 it's nice it's
super fast I think that is quite enough
talking for now though let me get this
all put together
and then I will start overclocking
so as test setups go everything came
together pretty easily here I've got the
hyper 212 installed on top of the 6500
I've got the memory video card storage
in place and I actually spent a couple
hours last night going through just
messing around with stuff and trying out
the overclocking capabilities of this
configuration so yeah full disclosure it
is Friday morning now but I am happy to
say that I was able to overclock my 6500
K I settled in on just over 4.2
gigahertz for the overclock but let me
quickly give you a closer look at this
setup before I move on so here's the
flip side and I'm coming over here to
memory you will see that I have g.skill
this is Ripjaws 5 and this is 3200 speed
rated memory I'm not running it at 3200
but I want a memory that was fast enough
to keep up with them some potential
weird overclocking numbers that might be
thrown at it since we are doing vc l ik
b CL k adjustment which is going to
affect the cpu frequency as well as the
memory frequency although fortunately
not much much else for graphics card I
just dropped in a 980 I that's because
it was sitting there to my rights and it
was available I know I'm matching some
high-end hardware up here with this guys
but this is really just purely for
testing and overclocking purposes 980 T
has day though and then the Plextor m6e
is sitting in there just below it for
our main operating system lastly just so
you guys can see what I'm doing I have
this HDMI cable going out of my graphics
card and into my Elgato Game Capture HD
60 and then that's being captured by my
capture system and that is how I'm able
to well see what's going on on this
screen over here then also see and
capture stuff over there which I'm
showing you guys too much
behind-the-scenes stuff right now let's
say hey whether we're in the operating
system and let me just show you guys the
default specs for the 6500 so up here I
5 6500 core voltage is going to be
jumping around because right now all
those little the power saving functions
are still in place core speed is going
to be jumping a little bit it's going up
like three point four and then it's
resting down when it's idling and that
sort of stuff at a lower frequency I did
notice that the bus speed is a little
bit higher than it should
be it's at 100.8 3 which is why we're
seeing some slightly weirder numbers
here but ultimately what you have here
is a core speed of 3200 megahertz and
then this processor will automatically
overclock itself depend on how many
cores are being used so we'll go up to
3.6 on a single core if it's using 2
cores it will go up to 3.5 if it sees in
3 cores it'll go to 3.4 and if it's
using all 4 cores it only do 3.3 so only
100 mega Hertz boost over what was there
before you can see that also reflected
over here on hardware monitor or we can
see the vcore for example at one point
184 note here that apart from the
voltages we can also see all of our core
temperatures and then as we move a
little bit further down here we can see
the actual clock speed so this has been
topping out again on a single core at
3.6 gigahertz or so but that it's also
under clocking itself down to 800 when
it is idle okay next up I need to
restart and show you guys what's going
on in the BIOS so I've been going
through all the overclocking I have made
use of a couple features of this
motherboard one is the fact there is a
dual BIOS switch right there so I just
switched back over to my overclock
setting the other thing that I was
making use of is the clear CMOS which is
actually a button over here on this side
when I would start an overclock and then
I would get the hang or it would stop
responding or whatever I would basically
hold down the power switch and tell the
system shut off then I would turn off
the power on the power supply over here
hit the power again
to flush all the power that's out of the
system and then flip everything back on
and then generally it would start up
again if that wasn't working which only
happened one or twice as I was trying
some more outlandish things then I would
do all that and with the power supply
supply turned off hold in the clear CMOS
button for about five seconds
that clears everything and resets it
back to default on the BIOS that you're
set to and then you can kind of go back
and key in your your overclocks again
fortunately I didn't really have to do
that more than once or twice but I was
getting some pretty frequent lock ups
when it comes to attempting higher
overclock so I was going for 4.4 or 4.5
and this processor wasn't really able to
hit it bear that in mind when you're
overclocking CPUs it's it's a shot in
the dark how far your CPU might be able
to overclock some of them do better some
of them do worse this one happened to do
pretty
recently I think but anyway on a typical
startup I would reset oh gosh I didn't
hit that clear seam no I didn't the
hell's going hot
that was weird okay so on a typical
start startup I'd reboot and then as its
booting up you tap delete and that's how
you get into the BIOS so here's the the
BIOS from asrock they have a graphical
layout you can use your mouse to
navigate around and you'll notice here
in the top left the version I'm using is
2.61
that's not currently available directly
from the asrock website it's available
in the beta download section or you can
find direct downloads for certain places
they're actually not only on 2.4 right
now but thanks to a stock for pre
loading this BIOS up for me I thought
that was nice and apart from that we can
get our first glance at stuff like the
deer and that's installed and what it's
running at and if the XMP profile is on
what storage is in there I had the fan
set to silence now which is actually
pretty nice and quiet and I'm happy to
announce that that was actually
functional when I was running some tests
on this just now alright so we're gonna
go into advanced mode and that's how you
do the overclock in here again we see a
layout of kind of what the motherboard
is and CPU and all that good stuff OC
tweakers where we're going to be doing
our OC tweaking and here up at the top
you can see the settings that I went for
so I finished on 4.2 to make gigahertz
there's also the cache speed which also
ramps up my base clock or BC LK speed is
one point one hundred thirty one point
eight seven five and I did that so that
42:20 would be a nice round number
memories running at just over 2800 so
let me just kind of run through and show
you guys what I did first off I went to
DRAM and I was initially playing with
XMP settings what you should do probably
is going here tell it to use XMP
settings but then which I can do right
here there's a profile one I'm not going
to mess with it right now but once you
tell it to do XMP settings it's going to
try to set your DRAM frequency in the
case of this memory to 3200 I didn't
want to do that so after it was set you
can go in here specifically and tell it
what frequency you want to run at I'd
recommend sticking between 21 33 and
maybe 2,600 ish or so I was able to be
pretty stable at 2800 so that's what I
went with but this is kind of where I
would start out
after you've done that and go back and
then we will go into the voltage
configuration voltage is one of those
things that you just need more of if
you're looking at overclocking one of
these lower end CPUs simply puts you're
going to be increasing the TDP
theoretically you're going to be
generating more heats in order to do
that you need to tell it
give me more voltage I'm at 1.35 right
now although I was messing this one
point three to five one point three to
five for Sandy Bridge processors is a
good starting at point you might range
up to one point three five one point
three six one point three seven if you
notice in your operating system as
you're running benchmark tests and
putting a load on the system that you're
hitting one point four above I had dial
it back you probably don't want to sit
at one over one point four volts with
these CPUs and also bear in mind with
voltage I'm specifically talking about
the skylake CPUs here because voltage
tolerances tend to vary a bit from CPU
to CPU anyway set it to fixed mode
instead of auto are offset and tell it's
one point three five in this situation
but I would say start off on the one
point three to five and then only add a
little bit more if you need it finally
the CPU configuration in here is where
the rubber meets the road or so to speak
and again I'm not doing a whole lot of
advanced settings in here I'm pretty
much mainly just messing with the B CLK
frequency and here I started off at well
I did one ten first and then I was like
that's boring and then I went to one
twenty and then I went to one thirty at
one thirty I was stable tried to go to
one forty which one of the woods one
forty even do if I key it in here one
forty gives us almost a four point five
gigahertz overclock as you can see up
here four point four eight but that was
not stable so I ended up dialing it back
and I've just completely lost the number
I even had said anything that's okay the
nice thing about this is you can use the
plus and minus actually Jess so I'm just
going to hold - down to roll ourselves
back down to four was at four point two
- yeah and it'll get us all the way back
down here now one last thing you should
do before you restart and load into your
operating system and see if it's stable
is double check your target memory speed
that's going to be reflected here
if this is too high or if it's higher
than you want it to go again just jump
back over to DRAM configuration use a
different frequency drop down here and
set it manually to what you want it to
be at once you've done all that hit f10
save and exit it will restart go back
into the operating system and you should
be all set to go now again it's this is
very much a your mileage may vary
situation when it comes to what
motherboard you're using I'm using an AZ
rack motherboard if you're doing this on
an MSI or a gigabyte or an asus or an
EVGA the interface is going to look
different some of the labelings of
things might look a little bit different
but the basic stuff I talked about as
far as BC ok and as far as what else the
memory as far as well although all those
labels should be roughly the same so you
should be able to figure out what's
going on ok so we're back in Windows so
this is Windows 8 and as you can see her
hopefully as you can see we have a
successful overclock let me zoom in okay
so and CPU Z you can see the bus speed
is at one thirty one point eight ish
core speed is at about 40 to 20 and you
know it's going to fluctuate here and
there just a little bit multiplies to 32
so here's where you can see maybe more
directly the difference between
overclocking via bus speed and
overclocking via multiplier overclocking
via multipliers what you would do if you
had like a 6600 K or one of the case Q's
it was unlocked multiplier overclocking
is simply taking a bus speed of which
usually usually is 100 granted you can
do both but I usually the bus speeds 100
times your multiplier so multiplier of
44 for example with a bus speed of 100
would be 4.4 gigahertz or 4400 megahertz
for the overclock in this case we're
leaving the the multiplier locked
because it is locked and we can't touch
it which is in this case at 32 and bear
that in mind when you're overclocking
it's going to be when your BC okay
overclocking it's going to be adjusting
that based on the base multiplier of the
CPU not the turbo multiplier so taking a
bus feed of 131 times 32 gives us our
overall overclock of 42 20-ish we also
of course are working on four cores and
four threads so let me point out some of
the other quirks though of this
overclocking method because I will say
there was a few
them that um I don't know they were
funny I was hoping I would have to deal
with quirks but anyway here's our V core
which is at one point three four
actually just slightly below the one
point three five that we set it to so
that's cool also we can see system
temperatures but if we scroll down there
is no actual temperature listings on our
I five sixty five hundred here we can
see Lupo sorry it's jumpy jumpy we can
see voltages needs of powers clocks
utilizations but we can't see the
temperature it's weird as weird when
overclocking I kind of got used to it
it's a little bit more like overclocking
in the dark often when you're
overclocking you want to you want to
take a look at your temperature because
when you see like hey I'm heading ninety
ninety five degrees Celsius that's too
hot so this was a little bit stranger
since you can't see the temperature of
your CPU and that's just one of the
things that goes along with this
overclocking method since it's not
really like fully Intel sanctioned I
didn't run into too many issues as far
as I could tell I'm sitting here right
next to it and I have a general idea
based on past experience like how hot
like a heat sinks getting based on the
CPU and these CPUs are lower TDP s
overall which means chances are they're
not going to get that hot but something
the to bear in mind also notice here for
our clocks the what they are at right
now is this column this is the lowest
and this is the highest so you'll notice
the turbo-boost is not taking affect we
have 42 15 and 42 24-hour minimum and
max clock speed so it's always going to
be running at that higher frequency as
far as power consumption that's means
that you're going to use more power but
it's not the end of the world for sure
and but again just one of those little
quirks and something to keep in mind
when you're doing this after I got
booted up into the operating system
after dialing in my overclock loading up
CPU Z and a little bit of hardware
monitor to kind of keep an eye on things
I was just using Cinebench in order to
run through it and kind of validate very
quickly if everything was stable
fortunately most of my instability came
upon boot up when I actually did boot
into the operating system I haven't had
any issues with instability so far going
through a single run of Cinebench is not
necessarily a
like load burnin test I would want to
take something like prime95 and run it
overnight to make sure everything was
nice and stable but by and large if you
can get through Cinebench Cinebench run
you're probably going to be okay
down here that you can see what kind of
performance increase I got at least with
Cinebench by doing over clocks at the
bottom is the baseline score of 548
that's right here and that's running at
default frequency and then I have
several others I 565 hundred tests that
you can see right here this is the four
point two two gigahertz overclock right
here I know Cinebench doesn't show that
but trust me it is we got up to 689
points and that was an increase of about
26 percent overall when comparing the
overclock speed to the none overclock
speed pretty nice I would say but
ultimately I'm still left a little bit
torn I guess I what I wanted to do with
this entire project was come to you guys
and say here's a list of parts here's a
computer you can put together here's a
few fairly simple two steps you can take
to get yourself up and running and get
yourself more bang for the buck that's
what it's always about more for your
money it's a little bit more complicated
than I had hoped
it's definitely not like crazy
complicated like if we go back to you
know overclocking in the 90s or anything
like that
but there are some quirks and some
things that just make it a little bit
less accessible for somebody especially
who has never built a computer before
what I think this video warrants is
another follow up video with some
additional testing so that's what I'm
going to do split this into another part
what I want to do next is first get that
6600 K installed in here and see how I'm
testing and scoring compared to that
hour on it run some more benchmarks
apart from Cinebench I want to do some
gaming tests and see what kind of actual
gaming improvements we're getting also
comparing to the 6600 K I'm just kind of
show like if you want to go this route
it's a little bit more niche it takes a
little bit more effort after the fact
you got to do a little bit of tweaking
and tuning with overclocking
overclocking is always you know a
variable as well you never know exactly
what you're going to get I got to 4.2
here pretty stable II a lot of other
people who have been reading articles
for online have hit 4.4 and above but it
depends on how much voltage you're
willing to drop into it depends on your
cooling solution I'm using a very
effective but also budget oriented
cooling solution here so all of those
things kind of play a part anyway though
I'm going to follow this video up I
promise next week with some more testing
some more benchmarking so let me know in
the comments section down below what if
anything in particularly you would like
me to test out on this rig if you have
any other suggestions for things you
want to see me do with this
configuration to give you guys some
better ideas of what you can do when it
comes to getting those less expensive
skylake processors and overclocking them
last thing I want to point out is that I
went with the 6500 but a lot of the lot
of the actual benchmarks and other tests
I've seen going on on a line in the past
month or so have said a 6400 might be a
better bet I like both of those
processors because they're actual quad
cores and they're the cheapest full quad
cores you can get in the sky like lineup
so I might even go for 6400 and see how
that goes maybe just kind of see if I
get a better luck of the jaw when it
comes to the kind of overclocks I'm able
to achieve anyway though guys I know
I've rambled a lot in this video but I
get excited about this stuff there's
lots of tests there's lots of potential
there's lots of variables to account for
so again let me know in the comment
section down below
what you think I should be doing for the
follow-up for this video thanks so much
