mind out of my little flicker to be
perfectly honest right only because it
seems to have been doing it a lot less
than it was this true earlier okay okay
could have been just right when you
started streaming to youtube that's
probably yeah I might've been it too all
right guys high cpu usage detected
that's all right that's nothing to be
done about that hello everyone and
welcome to awesome hardware this is the
live show the count on i do usually
every tuesday evening at five-thirty
p.m. pacific time we're streaming a
little bit early today because we're not
where we usually are actually in England
just it feels like we're streaming
really late yeah it feels like it's
super late but we're actually early it's
2 a.m. over here yeah it's bad it's 1
143 I believe and we have been here for
since earlier today and we can't exactly
tell you guys why we're here yes but
maybe there will be some more content
later in the week that shares that
information with you hopefully that's
how it goes I'm vlogging also we're
using a kind of hack together rig um
including streaming from laptop so we
don't usually stream to and things might
not work out how two percent of the time
but we will do our best to keep them
working so if there any stream hangs or
anything like that blue change Jerry
dropped oh yeah that's gonna happen ok
that's totally gonna happen ok frame
rates gonna be all over the place free
mates probably like super sketchy ok
look at that glorious frame video saying
why are they complaining so much more
this time I don't know like we just saw
its cuz you're on my youtube now right
it's all the people on my YouTube who
weren't completely before that's twitch
yeah switch why are you reek employing
if we've already established all these
things or is it just dropped frames I
mean that could be it too honestly the
main thing is that I need a new laptop
apparently if I'm going to be streaming
from the road that or I needed to set up
like a 2 a 2 laptop configuration with
more capture cards right which could
also work wow it's even super laggy on
exploit yeah well that's how I really
know when it's like ease ya an exploit
is like but I don't I don't think
there's anything to be done about that
yeah how are you guys we gotta stop
streaming d to youtube that's another
are you streaming it 720 on YouTube I
thought I said it too
but I don't think that matters no is it
you tell oh you in a 1080 on YouTube
yeah maybe I could change that I mean
that's right now it's the only thing I
difference i can see between your eyes
are you even allowed to change it after
the stream has started good question
yeah you should be able to ingestion
settings yeah interesting there we go in
just that shoot no you cannot you cannot
change it lame it's all right it's okay
okay all right so guys this just could
be a little choppy and epic ciao I'm
sorry if you don't like that but there's
nothing we can do about at this point
you're into like the chip all right also
you know the the I mean the content in
jail is just gonna be kind of
lightweight we really last week said to
ourselves you think we can stream from
England number like probably maybe and
then we managed to get it working to
some extent so that's kind of where red
yeah right I real quick I'm gonna plug
our stores like we usually do so guys
check out the stores here they are Cal
stores awesomesauce network.com slash
store yep sure it's all available their
trips all very glorious is your
high-quality buy them now I wouldn't buy
them a shout-out stamina buys during the
show also my store is Paul sabra dad net
or store Paul's hardware net and I have
this new updated thumbscrew men's shirt
in tri-blend the very soft tri-blend
shirt zero insertion first sports shirts
as well as mugs and pike glasses and all
that good stuff um as far as drinking
that's good you usually drink on the
show you the same thing I finished my
beer you did we're doing the same thing
now even so i'm switching decider the
asp also is a question on Cal's half of
the show I lost face off which was an
epic rock paper scissors tournament
mm-hmm does it you said it it carries
over but you said that I have to I have
to do that when I drink my beer what if
it's cited your beverage well you said
better i did say your beverage at some
point is when i right so it's
all-encompassing nice try though fine no
problem I can handle that so every time
I drink my beverage I'm supposed to say
in English phrase yes you can either
make up one of your
down but then I have a feeling that it's
I can't Oh at all because once it starts
accepting video footage at 1080 real it
can't just change the resolution midway
through and they probably don't have
anything that'll go back and like you
know you can figure the old stuff all
right has it hey I see it caught up
we're fixed again see you gonna it was
just it just need to catch up to me
closing Photoshop that's where here we
go yeah all right yeah I can business /
pec everything's fine this is normal
nothing bad will happen from Europe all
right let's go back to this story here
real quick so good and again that was
the big I really the very fast SSD they
also have a very big SSD that they've
announced it's a 60 terabyte SAS SSD
specifications hollister right here
actually first found out about the sun
on engadget story which i will pull up
here briefly because they do have a
picture at least of the demo that has
that they have going on of it this was a
l'article this is the whole article i
was poking fun of this article sorry
Brittany Vincent but this article was
very lightweight I actually gathered
most of my notes from this from the
picture and the specs that they had here
the article was listing it as like look
this can hold 12,000 DVDs and 400 photo
a million photos and I was like this is
and gadget you're not best by trying to
sell to a grandmother you know you tell
them how many dvds worth of information
it cold anyway 30 family photo which I
was just complaining about that the
drive itself though getting back to the
specs 60 terabytes of capacity so
seagate apparently is trying to put
themselves out of the mass storage
market when it comes to mechanical
drives that means that 17 of these
drives could give you one petabyte of
storage freaking petabyte in 17 3.5 inch
drives that's that's pretty impressive
if you ask me four terabytes per watts
of power efficiency and if you're a data
center guy that's a big that's a big
very importance to asp stat for you 3.5
inch form factors so um you know slot
into existing or you know raid
configurations that hold 3.5 inch drives
ultra-dense micron NAND flash and then
what
they're demonstrating right now is just
a demo units they're saying that it will
officially make its debut in 2017 but we
don't really know when and 2017 minute
that information remains to be seen 60
terabyte drives up that's a pretty but
what says what's the biggest drive
that's available right now like it for
tmobile samsung the samsung if you look
at SSDs yeah i was thinking like there's
10 there's a decent amount of 8 and 10
terabyte mechanical drives that have
come out just recently yeah as far as
SSDs because you just did that last week
you talked about the the Falcon mmm pc
that like came equipped like you could
outfit it with like to Newton other new
Titan axes oh yeah and that came with
like the largest consumer SSD which was
like the new 4 terabytes and terabytes
am son yeah man I think that's the
largest one so that's impressive yeah
jumping up to 60 terabyte seems like a
pretty big jump but um I guess only for
business use for now yeah I guess when
it comes to like seagate and western
digital they're both companies that have
kind of you know very juggernauts when
it comes to the mechanical storage space
but um have been sort of making inroads
here and there in the SSD space but
that's a pretty significant one of you
hope so that all right next up we have
an article here and I am essentially
going to kind of read over this article
with you guys I skimmed it earlier again
we're on the road and everything so we
haven't had quite as much of an
opportunity to set up the show like we
usually do but this is an antec article
comparing three skylake core i3
processors 51 watt TDP ones I 363 2060
360 100 tested they go through a huge
amount of testing in this like over the
test bed performance real-world office
Linux legacy alien they do a bunch of
gaming comparison the shadow of mordor
and then of course they have the
conclusion at the end real quick I
wanted to just look at the specs that
they're comparing here so all of these
chips that they're comparing today or 51
watt TDP options so that's pretty cool
since our I threes they're all going to
have two cores and then some of them I
think all the ones that tested today
have hyper threading so like I 32 cores
with a fake for core I mean sort of an
in-between for core option with
hyper-threading high-fives you get 4
cores physical
you but no hyper-threading so you only
get four addressable threads when the
high sevens is what you have to pay the
big bucks for to get your four cores
with hyper-threading 48 addressable
threads by the operating system all the
other specs are listed here pretty high
range of base frequency all the way up
to 3.9 gigahertz depending on which one
you're using but really what we're
talking about is budget options here
when it comes to Intel skylake
processors if you're not willing to
spend what it takes to get a quad core
on this platform which costs at least
180 or 190 dollars and then you gotta
look at the other options and those are
dual core a lot of people look at these
and say well is it sufficient being a
dual core rather than a quad core you
know is it gonna we had a question just
before the beginning of our show today
talking about like can I drop a 1070 in
with like one of these I three chips or
something like that and the answer at
least when it comes to this review is
yes in some situations so again this
link is that the story is linked in the
description on my channel if you guys
want to check out the whole thing how
they recommend it because an antec does
really good work and they cover pretty
much all their bases when it comes to
testing and that kind of thing did they
pair these with just one GPU or like
several different video cards they test
different video cards so they test video
cards it a little bit more make a little
bit more sense as to what you might be
comparing with an i3 for example yeah
and then you know basically here's
here's what they are looking at 6320
6360 100 l3 cache of three or four
megabytes base clock 3.7 to 3.9 these
don't have turbo boost that's the other
thing they have intel HD 350 graphics
and let's let's look at some of these
results down here so the kraken 1.1
lower time is better you can see the
i3's this is more of an instructions per
clock test and you can get massive price
to performance when you look at single
toy performance in particular with the
i3's they just they just kind of
dominate so you can see even when you're
comparing it to the more budget range
options from AMD down here like an 83 70
or 6350 just their they're kind of far
in a way better and that's where you can
see a lot of the changes when it comes
to what Intel is done with advancing
their their GPU I'm sorry cpus and there
are
texture over the past few years whereas
intel has it been quite as much also
sorry for the video freezing up I will
fix that right now hold on thank you for
the donation flip and Fred well guys I
finally began my fantex build and the
best part is my EVGA 1080 for the win is
on its flippin way nice nice Fred I hope
that boot build goes smoothly for you me
too that's a really good car though the
1080 for the win it's beautiful you'll
you'll enjoy it alright ok sorry I fix
the video let's jump back here and look
at just a few more of these test results
3d particle movement 2 point 0 beta so
this is a multi-threaded test so here we
can see the FX 8370 which is a fork or a
thread chip scoring much much higher so
here you can see having those actual
extra cores there when you're not
restricted to a more single threaded
test you're going to get better
performance when we are here as well
since it's also most multi-threaded we
can see some of the the chips that have
more threads available to them
performing better but still the i3's
kind of hanging right in there with with
the pack so they're not too far off and
then we get into the test the other
tests here you're going to see
integrated graphics so that's another
comparison that you might make when
you're comes to i3s integrated graphics
performance is not that great so if you
are looking to actually actually game or
use like an igp you for gaming here's
where you would probably not want to go
with one of these Intel chips because
AMD definitely still has the advantage
there when it comes to the integrated
graphics in there ap use and hopefully
we'll see like some Zen based stuff and
later this year early next year that
have you know still really good
integrated GPU performance maybe with
some like Polaris architecture or Vega
Rica texture or something like that just
curious what videocard did they use with
it this is integrated graphics I I mean
I know but for the other tests where
they just did gaming performance your
jig it in the Heather okay okay your
yearly moving we're moving down the list
I thought we were moving away from now
okay so okay good here's a couple
actually game tests so this is grid
Autosport with an hour 90 285 a two gig
card so this is something that's much
more budget still two hundred forty
bucks but you can see comparing
this chip with something like 285 maybe
GTX 1060 maybe even an r 9 r x 480 or RX
470 but here again you can see the chips
doing really well so great autosport
doesn't take advantage of all the
threads quite as well so you get more
single thread performance GTA 5 here
paired with a 980 Strix 4 gigs so much
higher end card but the i3 is still
holding up pretty well again even on GTA
5 which is a pretty intensive game
Alyssa CPS right up there with the FX a
370 which is an eight core cpu 8370 i
think is a fork or with hyper-threading
okay our AMD's version of hyper
threading right I 560 600 of course is
still getting you at the top so you can
see you are hurting the performance of
the card a little bit by going with
these chips but you know at all it's all
how much drop off it is and it's going
to vary from game to game and how the
game operates and all that kind of stuff
so right for any of you guys who asking
that kind of question oh no videos left
again it's happening a lot more this the
staff of the show let's see uh very
other 6320 the i3 is only what one
hundred and fifty sixty bucks on newegg
that's pretty good and you know what
this kind of like puts you know it kind
of like um I don't know it kind of kills
the myth that like if you're gonna go
for a budget gaming system that you have
to always go AMD you know because an amy
has like growing really good reputation
a strong reputation for being the good
budget option but I feel like a lot of
people just use that as the easy answer
like the end-all answer like oh if you
if you can't spend more than two hundred
bucks on processor for gaming just just
go away and be you'll get away more bang
for the buck well that that's actually
not true based on these findings that's
kind of interesting I mean that is their
final words down here is that the
skyline core i three parts represent the
best all-around cpus at their price
choosing one for system guarantees good
return in performance well that might
not always be the best for specific
applications specifically ones that used
four or more processing threads and and
use them heavily in the gaming tests the
I 360 monitor was only to 24 frames per
second down um compared to so much more
expensive chips so noise
cool I would like to see I would like to
see Intel offering a factual for
courtship a little bit more reasonable
price than the high close to 200 range
you know I just again that's something
where I think we need a little bit more
competition from AMD for them to do that
but you know every time I bill I add to
a system built or something and I'm like
here's the Intel chip and I know it's a
little expensive but here's what you got
to pay if you want to give forth four
cores and I like having that but you
know if you're not doing higher end
gaming than the i3's seemed very
valuable indeed okay a cool cool article
and thank you to who did this article on
an antec Ian thank you Ian countries for
that article very thorough very good all
right I have one more story here to talk
about all right this one is free games
who wants to place free games everybody
go play free games they're old games you
still want to play them the Internet
Archive has added ten thousand playable
amiga games hang out yeah um so they
they have a software library library for
the Commodore Amiga it's a 16-bit home
computer that launched back in the 80s I
believe that launched in the 80s and
total collection has ten thousand three
hundred sixty five games applications
and demos and the cool thing is that the
games are playable right there in the
browser so if you go to the link of the
story and i'm not going to pull it up
right now because i'm already maxing out
my cpu usage on this on this laptop
don't click anything but yeah totally
some of you can play all these old old
school games like bubble bobble lemmings
lemmings holiday lemmings 1993 lemmings
too apparently there was a huge amount
of sequels sequels now here's a look at
the Amiga if you guys aren't familiar
but it actually looks like since the
upgrade you come Commodore 64 I had a
Commodore 64 back in the day but I was
also trying to explain to KY all the
game lemmings because it was just it was
a very fun game back in the day your are
you familiar with this game at all nope
lemmings so like the basic premise is
there's an entrance and an exit to every
level it's a 2d type game
mm-hmm and all the lemmings just start
coming out and they're like lemmings
right they just keep walking whatever
direction they're going yeah but you
have certain lemmings that you can
assign different different like roles
like you can make an exploding lemming
or you can give a lemming an umbrella or
certain lemmings that like this little
guy here is building a little bridge or
like steps or something like that and
you know depending on the level so it's
like a puzzle game you have different
numbers of lemmings you can you can
decide to do different things and all
that kind of fun stuff as a really fun
game old-school kind of strategy game
but I was telling Kyle lemmings is
actually the game that worms was created
as a response to because lemmings you
know pretty simple 2d platformer type
game puzzle solving all that kind of
thing you're supposed to use these worms
ability to save all the worms lives you
know and help them move on to whatever's
next or whatever worms is like no
there's just worms they'll have guns and
they'll try to kill each other guns and
explosives and that kind of thing pretty
pretty fun stuff nice anyway so if you
guys want to play some old school games
check it out again it's at the internet
archive and these are all playable
within the browser so I feel like we
should keep this in mind for future
shows since oh yeah we've already done
we've already done face off this round
you'd think of something English to say
oh wait bubble and squeak those good
works okay there's some good ones on
here that was a right Bob job this is
all right Oh blue v-neck does i need to
say with more of an accent I was good I
was gobsmacked gobsmacked is a great one
she was talking nineteen to the Dozen
that was alright got all pear-shaped I
like gone pear-shaped she says get make
short of a sandwich it's so much sort of
a picnic there's a picnic sort of a
sandwich yeah big mature is sandwich
okay she's a slice short of a loaf make
sense yep all right uh guys that is all
for the actual plans portion of my part
of the show yeah so I should double
I can make sure that we're not rear
frozen again oh this is damn it well you
see our beautiful CJ one of the most
popular episodes of awesome hardware
we've ever done this is the one episode
that like you know talent scouts are
gonna be like what like looking at our
stuff and we're gonna go to this show
like wow I don't even know how these
guys are still around i hope not hold on
i just hit refresh it didn't fix it oh
no are we just that strapped for super
cheap and right now completely squeezers
have no more cpus what do you have in
here you have a core i7 yeah it's an i7
sofa has well mobile chip yeah but still
there it is alright that's way better
just to restrain right everything guys
we're gonna take a few questions here to
round out the show and give you guys a
little bit more content and then we will
be on our merry way um but yeah let's
pray game every time the screen freezes
we have to do a shot we don't have
anything to do shots of no we don't
that's probably our biggest I mean we do
but we probably be broke by the end of
it yeah the anything we would do shots
up here would be cost us like 50 euro or
so I have a lot of liquor in my room
which I didn't see in here ah I have
like like things of Scotch gin and rum
and vodka I have like a whole bar how
can they give you the room because they
know that I drink a lot okay it's
profiling they totally profiled me as
soon as we came in here I wanted to
check Johnson's abutting yes oh yeah
I've got some Johnson's I think we've
got one Johnson from our friend whose
name is William William William Johnson
Lillian thank you sir appreciate that go
home William if you the back my hand Oh
William oh BTW me another own button
