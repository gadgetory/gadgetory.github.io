hello everyone and hey guys how's it
going and welcome to probing paul
episode number 21 this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A
i am doing the episode for november
right now and if you guys want to look
at any of the past probing paul episodes
that i've done in the past there they
are in my probing paul playlist which is
linked in this video's description and
you can check that out all the questions
that I'm gonna be answering today which
are some tech based and some just random
questions people wanted to ask me are
taken from last month's episode so if
you want to ask me a question to be
answered next month in December then
feel free to leave those comments in the
comment section down below
and heck boy down there if you want hit
the thumbs up button that's always
appreciated too but let us jump right
into the questions for this month and
this is actually a follow-up from last
month that several people commented on
because one of the questions was about
Windows 10 activation and kinguin net
and is it still Ajit's and various other
sort of sub questions resulting from
that so I gathered a few responses from
different commenters about nicolosi for
example Nick Cage is that you can't tell
with sunglasses on he contacted Windows
customer support they transferred his
license after he showed them proof of
purchase of his new motherboard and CPU
so the Windows key was an old sticker on
his PC but they attached it to the
motherboards and switched it over so
there's an example of Microsoft taking
what appears to be an OEM license and
the dude saying hey I just bought this
new stuff can you transfer it over in
Microsoft a green to that which
apparently happens at least according to
Nick C and we you know I can't imagine
him misleading us so again these are the
types of things where I would say hey go
ahead and try this but unless we have
sort of a preponderance of evidence of
people saying they were able to do this
and it's like Microsoft policy then your
mileage may vary of course Knight
Raptors said he's used the same key on
multiple installs of Windows 7
and windows 10 the same key and it still
works
night rap night Raptor I have a
difficult time testing that myself
because it's kind of case-by-case and
there's lots of different types of
windows keys that come from different
locations but there were some people who
followed up and said that it worked the
same way for them as well so definitely
if you have an old Windows 7 license it
seems to very much be worth it to just
get Windows 10 install it you can
install it without a key and then just
plug the key in and see if it'll
activates and maybe sometimes it will
and if it doesn't then maybe contact
Microsoft directly and see if you can
talk them into activating it for you
finally Thomas said if you connect your
Microsoft account do you understand
license he's asking can you then use it
on to two separate machines easily yes
you can and it's more of like it's
attached to you rather than attached to
your hardware I still personally like
registering the key to my hardware
rather than my personal license but
that's up to you and if you are in a
situation where you just have a couple
systems and you need to say take
personally activated license on one
system and start using it on a new new
system you built or something
that's a viable option as well question
number two is also a follow-up from last
month and this is a correction on my
part because I was talking about one of
the earlier the first dual-core CPU that
I got and I claimed it was the AMD
Athlon 3200 plus and several people
darhk's fill as well as Losey laranja
and lord lord luck and mocha les agreed
and we're disappointed so sorry that was
totally my bad and I just wanted to
correct here and show you guys the CPU
that I actually had because it was an
Athlon 64 x2 3800 plus not 3200 plus
here's the CPU world entry for that it
was socket 939 and there's a sort of a
crossover period when the Athlon 64 x2
started coming out somewhere on 939 and
then I moved over to a m2 after that so
this was one of the slightly earlier
ones price and introduction was $350 it
was launched on August 1st 2005 it had a
dual channel memory controller and it
had of course two cores and two threads
right there as well as 64-bit as well as
being 64-bit so lots of aim the
innovation back in the mid 2000s on
display right there and thanks for the
correction let's move on to some real
questions for this month are the first
real this is probably the realest
question for this month by Peter Nowak
I believe I've answered one of Kyoto's
questions before and he actually asked I
almost ants up sorry I almost answered
this last month
it's about DDR ddr2 memory speeds in
general comparing say DDR 1600 casa
latency 8 vs. DDR 2800 test latency 14
he's talking about the difference
between rated speeds from memory and
caste latency or more more simply put
latency if you compare different speed
memory especially if you're comparing
ddr4 and ddr3 for example you might find
that they have the same actual response
time which is better speed or response
time especially if you're looking at one
kit that might be cheaper than another
that was this question from last month
and this was this question from this
much month which is the same thing as
well as a recommended memory for a 4790k
all right let me see how well I can
answer this question with some help from
crucial they have a landing page about
speed versus latency directly and also
addressing some of the misconceptions of
this I'm gonna lean on this because
crucial you know they know what they
doing when it comes to memory they're
saying that the perception when it comes
to latency is as late as speed increases
latency are true latency yeah which is
usually measured in nanoseconds goes up
this is a misconception though here on
the left the truth is that as speed
increases latency tends to remain the
same the true definition of latency and
the calculation that they have here is
true latency is a clock cycle time times
the number of clock cycles they are so
fundamentally put here memory speed is
how long it takes memory to do to do
something memory latency is how long it
takes to start doing that thing if
that's a simple way of putting it
they also have a chart here which I
thought found was fairly helpful because
it compares different generations so we
have SDR DDR and when they moved out to
double data rate memory and then we have
ddr2 ddr3 and ddr4 the module speed is
listed here in typical ddr3 speeds you
know a few years backward 1333 1600 1866
typical ddr4 speeds you'll see 2133 2426
66 if you look at the clock cycle time
in nanoseconds and the big question mark
on this chart is where they got this
clock cycle time
we'll come back to that in a sec if you
multiply that by the cast latency you
will get the true latency of that
particular kid of memory now if you look
here in the middle rankings
you'll find for example ddr3 1333 speed
memory with a clock cycle time of 1.5
and a casa latency of 9 actually was a
little bit faster 13.5 nanoseconds then
the ostensibly faster speed memory of
1600 and 1866 which actually had a
little bit higher latency time 13.7 v
and 13.9 3 the article does go on to
address this specifically and indicates
for example the latency dipping down a
bit down to the 13 nanosecond range here
whereas it crept up a little bit if you
look at some of the slower ddr4 speeds
but then drops back down to about 13.5
if you're concerned about this bear in
mind that from ddr3 1333 to the EDR for
2666 modern memory span true lindsey
started at 13.5 nanoseconds returned to
13.5 nanoseconds there are several
instances in this range where true
Layton sees increased the gains have
been fraction by fractions of a
nanosecond there however in the same
span speeds have increased by over 1,300
mega transfers per spec for a second
which effectively offsets any trace
latency games so the answer here from
crucial and I tend to agree with them is
that speed is the more important thing
don't necessarily don't necessarily look
at cast latency and be like oh it says
cast latency 14 I should definitely get
that that over the castle and see 16 kid
or something like that speed is gonna be
the first thing you look at if speed is
the same then yes the lower cat cast
latency will mean a little bit faster
memory and now there is of course more
to go on here because as we showed you
this calculation that you make and then
also the clock cycle time figuring out
your clock cycle time is not necessarily
the simplest thing it is again a fairly
simple calculation and here's a video
that you guys can watch by Q Lu about
computer performance and relative
performance CPU time clock time but
clock cycle time is basically a value of
1 divided by your clock rate and
clock rate of course can vary a lot
depending on your CPU your motherboard
your base clock speed whether or not
you're overclocking in different factors
like that also bear in mind when it
comes to say you're looking at a modern
CPU that has runs that say 4 gigahertz
that's a pretty typical frequency 4
gigahertz is a simple number to look at
but if you calculate that to just
straight hertz that's 4 billion times a
second 4 billion times a second computer
is pretty fast it's pretty crazy to
think about
actually right now so if you look at
what a nanosecond actually is which is
1,000 millionth of a second or 1 over 1
1 billion basically that's when it
starts to get a little bit more
confusing to calculate these numbers and
figure out how many nanoseconds you're
actually dealing with when it comes to
the actual clocked cycle time of your
computer so if you can figure that out
then yes you can go on to figure out
your actual true latency of your memory
so maybe that's something that you guys
could dive into however going that far
is probably a little bit beyond what I
get into for probing Paul so hopefully
that is giving you sort of a stepping
off point for now and finally to finish
off the other two questions what's
better to buy 8 gigs or four by four
gigs effectively I would say go with 2
by 8 gigs the very very marginal
marginal minimal increase that you get
by populating all of your DIMM slots is
very much offset in my mind by the
ability to just upgrade and add more
memory in the future finally what memory
for overclocking to your mac recommend
for an i7 4790k and z97 motherboard I
would say just try to find a memory kit
that's around stable it's 1866 or 2133
those are higher frequency memory speeds
for that platform and you're not gonna
get too much additional performance by
going beyond that thank you for your
question pewter I hope I've answered
it's reasonably well moving along we
have a couple questions well basically
the same question is asked by a couple
people so an Irish Asian as well as
Robert Baek asked how come you don't
have an office yet
that's not here at my house also how
does my wife handle the mess this is a
follow up to some of the cleanup videos
I did last month same question from
Robert am I thinking of getting an
office like Jay and Kyle have and yes
more were more failed failed insults at
my cleanliness and organization
organizational habits
main reason is that I don't feel like I
need the office space at this time I'm
pretty confident that I have enough room
here to do what I do and do it
reasonably well my main issue has just
been building up the place to service my
needs more functionally with storage for
the places for the things I need to put
in storage and all that kind of stuff my
wife and I both really like our house
and we've worked on it a decent amount
so far but we have a lot of plans in the
next year to do some more upgrades and
that kind of thing and I really like I I
don't know I've always been fairly
comfortable just treating this as my
workspace even though it's part of my
house also I get to do a bit of a tax
write-off before having this is my
workspace so that doesn't hurt at all
and the additional expense of getting
office space somewhere else has just
never seemed like it would really work
if you work be feasible for me
financially I guess and then finally I
guess I would say I'm not completely
opposed to the idea of getting an office
or workspace somewhere else but it's
Brown it can happen this year I might I
might look into it again next year and
see see how things are going for that
but for the time being I like my garage
it works for me next question from Jonas
is spinning sand talking about free sync
and gsync adaptive sync adaptive refresh
rate is is the generic term for that
free sync and gsync are features that
are becoming more and more a necessity
than a nice-to-have these days that is
arguable but sure it's necessary is
smoother and stable framerate is a
smoother and stable framerate better
than a high frame rate frame count or
vice versa and just free sink or g-sync
remove micro stutter from SLI or
crossfire setups all right so for your
first question smooth stable frame rates
really high refresh rate my personal
opinion is smooth stable frame rate
that's where I'm at now there are
certainly gamers who much much prefer
high frame rates and you're talking
about 200 Hertz or 244 Hertz monitors
with any sort of vsync turned off and
they don't care about tearing because I
just want to see what's gonna be shown
there as quick as possible and that's
totally legit and my experience I like
the smoothness so I do prefer plus 60
going above 60 Hertz when it comes to
the refresh rate of the moderate so
I've been very spoiled by this guy back
here a hundred Hertz g-sync
and I feel like if you can get up into
the close one hundred Hertz with g-sync
or free sync enabled I think you have a
really nice smooth gaming experience and
you don't necessarily need to get up
into the say hundred and forty-four
Hertz to 200 Hertz frame rate as well
also the benefit if you're not as
concerned about pushing really high
frame rates depending of course of the
game you're playing and how difficult it
is is you might not necessarily need as
crazy high of a graphics card like you
won't need the power to push all those
frames at the higher resolution so
that's some to consider - I would say
consider the smoothness first versus the
high frame counts and in my opinion
unless you're a competitive gamer and
playing FPS games or something the
second question does freesync reduce ink
remove micro stutter from SLI and
crossfire it can help marginally but if
your graphics card if your computer is
taking a second to output a frame your
monitor can't do anything to solve that
it's still gonna be waiting on that
frame so it might insert frames in
between but it's just gonna into that
insert that same frame so if you're
having a micro stuttering that's caused
by an SLI or crossfire configuration or
a driver or something like that it's not
going to suddenly go away just by
getting free Seeker g-sync you're gonna
need to deal with that issue where it's
being caused which is often caused by
driver issues sometimes when you're
dealing with multiple graphics cards
that can introduce more problems as well
next question here from Eric Shen he
says he recently got a 1440p monitor
he's looking to get into 1440 gaming
current CPU and GPU combo is an i3 6100
which is a dual-core with a GTX 1063 gig
can I get away with upgrading my GPU
alone do you think I need a different
CPU as well if a different CPU is
required any suggestions he's got a be
150 motherboard and he's considering an
upgrade path option if he wants to
actually switch over from his entire
platform and get a new motherboard and
CPU now Eric I think you're actually in
a pretty good position right now because
your platform is not too old and you're
kind of on in in the in the area right
now where there's good deals brand new
CPU deals for your platform
because it's not quite old enough and
actually right now with Black Friday
when it comes to LGA 1151 the z170 and
z2 70 equivalents you have a more budget
chipset but still on that same platform
when it comes to your skylake options
there's lots of choices there so cabling
can skylake I would say consider a
quad-core upgrade for your CPU along
with a GPU upgrade in order to give
yourself the best 1440 gaming experience
possible because you will start to see
limitations with your dual core of
course depending on what game that you
play but take a look at a sky linking KB
like upgrade options that you have that
are compatible with your motherboard
make sure you update your update your
motherboards bios first and check your
motherboard CPU support list to make
sure that they update it for support for
these but like an i-5 7400 should slot
in there pretty well that would give you
four cores and a pretty nice boost in
CPU performance beyond that you could
even think about something like an i7
7700 it's a little over $300 a little
bit more expensive but that would give
you four cores and eight threads don't
bother with any of the case cues because
you can't overclock with your
motherboard anyway but you can get a
much better performing CPU to go along
with what you're talking about is
potentially a GPU upgrade as well and
that's that's kind of where I would go
you can do the GPU upgrade right now
with your dual core and kind of see how
things go so that could be an option for
you as well
you probably want the GP upgrade
regardless though because three gigs on
a GTX 1060 is probably not quite enough
for your 1440 gameplay again depending
on the game that you're playing
next question from lone wolf mccade can
you please explain Intel turbo boost
technology 3.0 and is it required for
overclocking this is a good question for
those of you who are familiar with it
but maybe you don't know exactly how it
works there's an Intel support page that
sort of explains it it's a driver
coupled with information stored in the
CPU it identifies and directs workloads
the fastest core on the die first that's
your that's your basic explanation from
there and there's a little bit more here
on what school do bear in mind it's only
gonna function with X 99 and X 299 based
on motherboards so the high-end desktop
stuff from Intel and I can give you a
quick demonstration of how it works
because it's actually running on this
system right now you don't need it for
overclocking so if you
overclocking in the BIOS or that kind of
thing you don't you don't need this if
you do basic Windows updates and you
have a system that's compatible in my
experience it will load this
automatically the turbo-boost max
technology 3.0 a little module here and
this is where you can actually go and
like add applications and you can tie
specific applications to how many cores
you want it to use and that kind of
thing so if you have an application that
you know like only uses two cores then
you can do that kind of thing with it
but really what this is doing is it's
identifying the core on your CPU and I
have a 69 50 X in here by the way that
is the fastest and the core lists that
it's determined for me is the fastest is
core number three Intel did this so that
they can compete with our high end
desktop CPUs a little bit better with
mainstream CPUs run higher frequencies
but don't necessarily have the same core
and thread count if you look at her
brand for 64 over here and I apologize
if this is kind of small you might
noticed as I've been streaming well not
streaming but recording this video my
actual clock speeds going on here and
you might notice that's if you look at
the max core number three right there is
actually hitting four gigahertz so that
is essentially what turbo boost max
technology 3.0 does it identifies the
core on your CPU that is the easiest to
overclock and it does it automatically
for you so when you're doing something
that only requires a single thread or
something like that
that core will run at a good 4 or 500
megahertz at least in my experience
right here faster than all the other
cores which you're only maxing out in
about 3.5 so that's basically what it is
and it's actually really easy to use and
it's pretty effective and my experience
so um I'm I'm for it
I guess especially if you're not going
to be doing any manual overclocking
definitely make sure that that is loaded
up because you will get some advantage
from it a Woollett 21 asks it says cool
lightsaber dude where did you get it oh
do you mean
this lightsaber
and break my monitor all right so this I
wish I was plotting this quite a bit
last months because I got it for my
halloween costume and I used it in the
videos thumbnail last month and stuff so
if you're wondering where I got it it's
a force FX
lightsaber I bought it on Amazon so I'll
put a link to the description down there
is actually several different variations
of this I bought mine for a hundred and
fifty dollars so a little bit on the
expensive side for a accessory for a
Halloween costume but I got it because I
knew it was kind of a showpiece type
thing this is the actual one that I got
it's the Darth Vader version and
apparently it's on sale now so if you
want to save 30 bucks compared to what I
bought it for it's 120 so that's kind of
nice and there's variations of the
lightsabers of course different colors
and everything and like if you got to be
Luke Skywalker you're fine or Darth
Vader 120 you're good you're golden Oh
what you want the blue lightsaber while
that price jumps up to 225 my god you
wanted to be mace window Windu with the
with the purple version $900 geez but
hey look it's purple it's the mace windu
it's got a different different handle to
is probably uses different types
different Kyber crystals but anyway oh
there's a bunch of different variations
on that and stuff here they've even got
the the asajj ventress that one with the
angled handle that one's only $1,500 Wow
Wow
alright I'm glad I didn't invest in that
one but yeah that that's that's where my
lightsaber came from but guys that is
all the questions that I have been asked
for this month not all of them but all
the ones I decided to answer now of
course if you have questions for me for
next month leave those in the comment
