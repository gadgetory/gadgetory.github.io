some curse words from time to time you
know not excessively but just bear that
in mind if you are sensitive to that
sort of thing but demonstrate right now
we already have been doing this show for
an hour this is episode number 130 of
awesome hardware and the first half was
on Kyle's YouTube channel which is known
as bit wit so check that out the link is
in the description as well as links to
all the stuff we're gonna be talking
about today which includes net
neutrality the galaxy X rumored from
Samsung as well as some some information
about a big old cigar shaped asteroid

yeah but if you happen to watch our
YouTube channels and you enjoy the
content we produce and you think that
were snappy dressers for instance with

thanks for being here everyone thanks
guys yeah we're drinking ale Smith nut
brown mmm getting that nut mmm oh it's
delicious it's quite tasty very good
beer yes indeed all right do the news
news from from Earth exactly that means
if you want I can turn on the effects
I'm sure everyone all right
net neutrality we're gonna launch into a
brief description of this it's been all
over the news today if you especially if
you've been on say reddit or anything
like that because the FCC today has
announced their new plans to eliminate
net neutrality rules and what Damona
pause this real quick that's a bad thing
I'm gonna watch Wolf Blitzer a couple
links in the video's description about
this on Rudy Reuters I'm sorry as well
as Ars Technica
net neutrality is under attack brief
history of net neutrality the internet
was created back in the 70s and 80s
start with ARPANET grew into what it is
today for a very long time net
neutrality was just sort of accepted as
as that's how the internet works there
was what was called light touch
regulation because if you went on the
internet and you wanted to go to that
website over there or that website over
there you were just able to do that
because the internet was and an
interconnected network of computers with
different websites and that
was the point of it was to do it to go
to whatever website you wanted that's
how it works right now in about one in
2013 there was actually some lis legal
stuff that happened with regards to the
Internet there was a challenge to the
enforcement's of the light touch
regulation there was another lawsuits
against the FCC to challenge that and
eventually in 2015 the FCC under the
chairman at the time Tom wheeler decided
to classify Internet service providers
wired the wired connection you get to
your home as well as wireless the
connection you get on your cell phone
classify them as what is called common
carriers which allowed the FCC to
regulate the Internet service providers
under title 2 of the Telecommunications
Act of 1940 reality to make an Internet
service provider such as Verizon or
Comcast or a TNC treats all data equally
wherever it came from out there on the
internet so if you at home wanted to
access Netflix
you couldn't stream that video from
Netflix or if you wanted to get on
Facebook you could access Facebook to do
that or any other websites or thing that
was on the internet you could do that's
what's being challenged right now it
actually started back in May they
introduced what was called an notice of
proposed rulemaking they took a bunch of
comments about that notice of proposed
rulemaking they received actually 22
million comments about it but there was
some controversy around that there was a
mysterious DDoS attack of the FCC's
comment system there were impersonating
person ations of people going on
comments that were submitted and then
they looked at the comment because their
public comments and you can see who made
the comment and they contacted that
person and say hey why did you say this
and they were like I never said that
there's been impersonations going on
there's also been people both live and
dead impersonated and spot spam bots
taking advantage
the batch submission API that the FCC
had on their website as well now there
has been analysis of the comments that
went through the system though and a
very analysis and in particular that's
referenced by the ARS technica article
that's linked in this video's
description was actually funded by
broadband for America the members of
broadband America for America include
AT&amp;amp;T CenturyLink charter Comcast many of
the large Internet service providers who
are actually behind the current attempt
to remove net neutrality from the
currents way that the FCC works a
specific study made by them found that
when they looked at unique comments that
have been made via the system nothing
that was repeated multiple times by a
batch entry or something where it was
like a form that people were just
copying and pasting and submitting
unique comments 98.5 percent 98.5
percent of people who submitted comments
like net neutrality want net neutrality
and do not want these rules to be
removed which is what is currently being
proposed so what happened today was an
introduction of these plans to
deregulate the broadband industry and
eliminate net neutrality rules by
reversing the 2015 classification of
home and mobile ISPs as common carriers
it was unveiled today tomorrow there
will be a formal introduction and then
the vote will actually take place on
December 13th the FCC is currently
republican-controlled and when you start
talking about Republican and Democrat
people immediately get into this tribal
mode where if you're on one side or the
other and you hate the other side and
everything it's very divisive and it's
very sad that the US has is kind of in
the state right now and it kind of sucks
i lure all of you if you are on one side
or the other to try to look at this from
a neutral perspective
don't take parties into consideration
but when it comes down to it the FCC has
five members five voting members and
three of them are Republicans two of
them are Democrats and chances are the
way the votes going to go down is as a
pie and the two Republicans are gonna
vote in favor of this new rule and the
two Democrats are gonna vote against it
and it's probably going to pass that's
the expectation right now as you pie if
you're not familiar with him former
lawyer for Verizon and although he seems
to be a super nice guy in person very
very much has showed no inclination
towards hearing what people seem to be
saying when it comes to what people want
that to actually happen when it comes to
net neutrality and the way the internet
is controlled so anyway what what does
this mean in basic terms for for
citizens of the United States
if this gets passed this is affect their
daily lives we'll get to that in just a
second okay but for right now let's talk
about what is going on as far as
potential responses to this the
Democratic Commissioner there's two
Democratic commissioners is like I said
Jessica rosenworcel is one of them
she has proposed that the FCC hold
public hearings across the country
before altering the rules so that they
can talk to people in person and perhaps
get through the potential you know of
the stuff that we're I already mentioned
about the online submissions for
commentary and stuff like that even
there's questions as to how the
legitimacy of a lot of those comments
yes so having person hearings but that
doesn't that's probably not gonna be
what happens the plan that is proposed
is called restoring Internet freedom
because it restores and I which I think
is because it restores two big Internet
service providers the freedom to charge
customers more money and block or slow
content as they see fit after the vote
there will probably be a lawsuits
against the FCC but in the past the
courts have generally gone with the
decision that the FCC makes so there's
not a whole lot of hope of that
happening but Kyle asked what like what
we're looking at what the what actually
might the the upshot or repercussions of
this be for you at home and where did
that go it's gone brace yourself it's a
Twitter it's Twitter link and I didn't
make it into an actual link so I didn't
actually open it hold on
so in Portugal there are no net
neutrality there are no laws to enforce
net neutrality so what what as you pie
in the FCC what as you press proposing
right now is like we don't need rules we
don't need any laws to enforce the
Internet service providers to treat
Internet traffic equally we don't have
anything that actually forces that all
we need is to tell them that you're
gonna be honest you as the Internet
service provider is gonna be honest with
the American people about how you treat
your traffic so as long as you tell
people oh so there's word there we're
not gonna let this traffic through it's
for if it's from this part of the
internet or this web site or whatever as
long as you tell people that it's
totally fine in Portugal there are no
net neutrality there are no laws to
protect net neutrality and this tweet
from Rihanna shows just a snapshot of
one of the net introductory packages you
can see this is the prices in Euros and
as you can see a messaging package if
you want to add that to your network
five euros a month if you want Skype
Google Hangouts and access to that the
social package an extra five euros a
month if you want access to Facebook
Instagram Twitter as well as all the
other popular social networking sites
the video package for an extra five
euros a month if you want to access
YouTube Netflix periscope and twitch the
music package if you want to stream from
your favorite music streaming pack
there's streaming websites an extra $5 a
month if you want access to Spotify or
google play music
email and cloud oh you want to connect
to your email service provider to
actually get to your email well you got
you didn't pay for the email package
with your basic low rate of $50 a month
for your internet so you're gonna have
to pay an extra five whatever euros or
dollars to access your email or your
Google cloud or your cool
or anything like that it's like me not
and this is this is this is this is not
a like specula photoshopped this is not
a speculative this is how this is what
it might happen this is how it actually
works I mean it's it's really really
horrible there's not a whole lot that we
can do right now except to contact as
United States citizens your
representatives and the the House of
Representatives or your Senators and
tell them emphatically that you really
really don't want this to happen let
them know that you will consider their
decision when it comes to getting in
touch with the FCC to let them know
about how their constituents feel that
you will take their actions on this as
an indication of how you should vote in
2018 that's really all you can do I mean
like it's it's sad that we have to
increase that what over 98% I'll that
over 90% to like 99.9% like the 98%
isn't good enough like 98% of us who
don't want charity to go away isn't good
enough like you still have to write your
Congressman to make it 99.999999% in
order for these in order for this to
stop happening it's just it's ludicrous
so yes it's incredibly frustrating if
any of you guys are outside of the
United States and looking in on this and
are sympathetic for us we I mean at
least we freq we greatly appreciate that
it really really sucks but yeah if you
want to contact your senator people your
Congress critters or whatnots battle for
the Netcom has a good sort of rundown of
what's going on right now and you can
enter your phone number and we'll give
you scripts of what to say when you call
in and that kind of thing driving calls
also has sort of another rundown with a
bunch of links to videos that probably
do a better just jobs and I have done
now talking about the problem from lots
of popular people it's exciting to see
certain websites get an annus like
pornhub I saw an article on them they
had a big banner across the top of the
website and for all it keeps coming up
and it might be fatiguing but it does
seem like when the the public has an
outcry that's significant enough about
this type of thing that you can get the
powers-that-be to listen so we sincerely
hope that they do if this does pass it
will probably be challenged in court and
we'll see how things go then but
hopefully there is enough backlash right
now like in the next two weeks before
December 14th that they at least have
second thoughts about just plowing
through with this with this decision and
the stupid plan that the FCC has come up
with to get rid of net neutrality all
right let's move on before no big yeah
deep deep breath and let's move on
alright so we talked about Battlefront 2
and the embattled EA with some of their
decisions when it comes to micro
transactions in the game and they they
backpedals pretty quickly last week
oh yeah they do they came back and
they're like I know micro transactions
for now
temporary rescind ation of the micro
transaction system yeah battlefront -
sorry the dogs are barking right now my
wife is ready oh my gosh everything's
fine everything's fine ok so yeah and
developer dice announced last week that
they are temporarily removing micro
transactions from Star Wars Battlefront
- good news maybe but yeah you gotta
consider a very-very
a very very like evidence in every
single actual legit communication from
ei about this was that word temporary
nevertheless
ventureBeat actually reported last week
that Disney CEO Bob Iger called EA CEO
Andrew Wilson after the backlash when it
became big news in order to discuss this
being a negative for reflecting
negatively on their intellectual
property especially with the launch of
the next Star Wars movie coming up in
December and that that was the reason
why they went back on their decision
there's a new report from Wall Street
Journal that says it wasn't actually
called between those CEOs and that might
have been just speculative or perhaps
you know fake news or whatever the
Disney head of consumer products and
intern act interactive media Jimmy
potaro did send EA a message though
expressing Disney's concerns and the
executives were upset at how online
outrage over the costs of gaining access
to popular characters such as Luke
Skywalker reflected on their marquee
property and that was what led to the
decision to make the change if you're
looking at EA as a whole and you're
hoping that all of the public backlash
against them has caused them to fail as
a company or something or seriously
reconsider their actions probably not an
SEC filing late last week so the
temporary removal of battlefront to
microtransactions is not expected to
have a material impact on EA's fiscal
year 2018 financial guidance so who
knows if that's accurate or if that's
just sort of them trying to communicate
to their investors that they shouldn't
freak out and sell their stock but it is
important again to point out that
everything here that's listed by EA as
far as actions are taking right now is
temporary and it might just be something
that they're trying to do to salvage
holiday season sales of their new game
and they're gonna immediately turn it
back on once that time frame has passed
who really knows it'll probably depend
on how pissed off people are and how
much they're slandering EA online
but hopefully for now people are more
concerned about net neutrality yeah
just just keep keep looping it better
than that bigger fish to fry
yeah people all right Tesla geez music
oh my was calm badass maybe should have
that song like intro or show every time
welcome Tesla's new electric semi-truck
I was introducing awesome harness yeah
the Dec new show that no one asked for
yeah featuring well full standing room
it's a Tesla last week I posited I'm
saying enjoy you killer two new vehicles
one that was more expected the semi
truck which is shown in this excellent
video with the awesome music it's super
corporate it's a semi the test size semi
it's an all-electric heavy-duty truck in
veiled it last week November 16th it
shares a number of parts with the model
3 including the same motor handles and
display screen gnarley' has a captain's
chair up in front which is centrally
located which is kind of different it's
got two display screens in front of that
a standing cabinet with that centralized
area which is allowed to be positioned
more towards the front of the cab
because there is no engine or
transmission up there to get in the way
so that's that's pretty nice it's also
got zero to 60 mile per hour
acceleration in five seconds which is
insane for a semi truck and it's got
Teslin glass which is armored and
apparently you can withstand bullets or
something like that what 500 mile range
30-minute recharge 1 million mile
guarantee from Elon Musk as far as the
durability of the truck goes and ramped
yes it's all pretty impressive when it
comes to stats their enhanced autopilot
with lane-keeping emergency braking
forward collision warning and production
of the truck should start in 2019 so
that's
for truckers but that was the first part
of this introduction the second part
that came later on was the Tesla
Roadster which which is super crazy it
is and all that not even the right thing
hold on
it's the Roadster any better pictures of
the Roadster sorry one sec it's a
$200,000 car yeah $200,000 the 50 grand
deposit required upfront mkbhd already
ordered one yeah yeah it was that is
shocking said no one ever
well he said he only he only spends lots
of money on cars and cameras which is a
reasonable thing I guess to spend a
bunch of money on but yeah the Roadster
it's a two-door but does have four seats
which is crazy when you look at it
because like where the other two seats
must be for very very small people in
the back or whatever but 0 to 100
kilometers an hour or 0 to 60 miles per
hour in 1.9 seconds one less than two
seconds 620 mile range so musk said you
could go from LA to San Francisco and
back in one charge which is pretty cool
for an electric vehicle quarter-mile
time of 8.9 seconds top speed of plus
250 miles per hour and 7400 foot-pounds
of torque which is 7 times what the
Bugatti Veyron Super Sport has also
pretty crazy when it comes to like a 1.5
million dollar car yeah like base so I
think it's a $50,000 down payment right
now but $200,000 is is the total cost of
the vehicle and you can pre-order one
right now like hell already said mkbhd
at least according to his Twitter feed
has ordered one and here is the so the
it's called going to plaid or extreme
plaid mode and there's a video of it
here why why is it called plaid mode um
because
it's it's it's the extreme acceleration
that it can do so it's got three
independent engines and this isn't the
type of thing that you could do as a
person controlling the vehicle you have
to like plug it in and be like all right
do the super dupe lad mode right now
yeah so there's a video of it here it
can set it up and they had this sort of
tunnel setup for people with lighting
and stuff like that going on in its and
let me jump forward so there's the
tunnel and this guy just had it was in
the passenger seat with his smartphone
which saves a Spaceballs reference yeah
it is it is a Spaceballs reference
absolutely and then and then you they
kick it off and it's just crazy
acceleration an interesting video to
watch equal most of the dudes reaction
yeah that's got to be some ridiculous
torque yeah I mean the video the video
doesn't really brush do justice I'm sure
I can't imagine that's like that's like
a roller like that's like Montezuma's
Revenge yeah that's like yeah it's
straight up like a roller coaster
let's go pretty sweet no time for
combustion
Turner granite model production is set
for 2020 for the Tesla Roadster
but of course grain of salt because the
model 3 right now which was already
supposed to be more available than it
currently is is suffering some pretty
significant delays in production so who
knows if that's gonna affect this as
well yeah alright the Roadster also
might be able to fly say just a quick
follow-up story based on some of Elon
Musk's tweets a special option package
yeah it takes it to the next level so
quite literally what yeah she's clarify
this is the base model performance there
will be a special option package that
takes it to the next level definitely
enable to fly not saying the next-gen
road roadster special upgrade package
will definitely enable it to fly short
but maybe how certainly possible just a
question of safety rocket Tech applied
to a car opens up revolutionary
possibilities so how you like some wings
you like snap some wings on the side
yeah how does that even some lifts like
what does the FAA have to say about this
I don't know it's a little crazy well
short hops what does that mean fly short
hops like it'll be able to like jump up
for like a split second and come back
down
look it'll actually levitate for a
moment before why so you have to deal
with speed bumps like never have to go
over speed when it'll just like levitate
over well just wait over a speed bump
from now on because anything beyond that
it's like you have to create air roads
if that gets ahead well you'd have to
add jet propulsion to it because any any
speed that it gets right now is from the
rubber meeting the road the tire the
actual tires so yeah I really know this
is very mysterious and we need some
Falcon 9 magic but you know yeah musk in
the past you know he had some crazy
ideas but they're they're typically not
just like him throwing out random
nonsense he's actually something behind
it so right we'll see yeah well we like
rocket League yeah would be great for
you know who's shooting goals yeah that
yeah hashtag goals
hey the Samsung Galaxy X the iPhone X
has just recently launched amidst a
flurry of publicity and whatnot the
Galaxy X which apparently has been in
development for a while there's been
rumors of a galaxy X device for a long
time so not necessarily them just biting
on the Sam on the on the iPhone X name
or anything like that but the model
number SMG eight eight eight and at zero
has been sort of floating around for a
little while there were some new
sketches of this and I think we briefly
showed this on the show that showed a
foldable
I could you guys can see this but
because they have been working on
foldable Oh le D displays although
there's still a lot of other components
in the device that can't fold so can't
necessarily make a completely foldable
thing but this one shows sort of a flip
designed with the foldable area in the
middle and an LCD or an O LED display
that it's such a yeah it looks like it's
so four times as tall as it is wide yeah
so I mean but it might be interesting if
it contiguous display across the middle
using that extra real estate for on
screen you know keyboards and that kind
of thing the ability to type or do
interaction without necessarily having
to you know eat up a lot of your screen
real estate or just the fact that you
have more screen real estate to work
with but the news as of today is the
fact that there is a new support page
for this device on the Samsung Korea
website for that specific model number
SMG eight eight eight and zero the n
zero apparently indicates it's the it's
for the Korean market eight eight as a
model number just knowing something
about luck
I don't know does that mean it's super
lucky usually the number eight is lucky
that seem like a model number that they
would choose for something that they
want to do really well not really sure
but unfortunately there's no new
information to be gleaned as far as spec
so that kind of thing from the product
page itself there is a little bit in the
article about some of the stuff that's
already known such as they've gotten
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi certification
they're expecting that it'll use a
snapdragon 835 processor because the 845
processor is not official enough yet
probably not far enough along in the
development cycle but a foldable phone
would be pretty cool to see I kind of
want to see like a reversing would've
the flip phone but with the folding
screen right I guess I kind of just want
to see what it would be useful for
other than being like hey lookit folds
it's cool what you could open up your
phone why sweet okay that's all for our
standard tech news segment let's move on
sword fight oh wait no no it's oh wait
oh yeah yeah
hold on one more pull here I got out of
order though and I close things and I
need a dish it's this this is this is a
random quick story about a new product
from xpg we all love our gb right so how
about an r gb SSD heat sink what the new
xpg storm RGB m2 SSD heatsink that's
right
someone it looks like it looks like a
mini GPU yeah it looks very thick I'm
very tall kind of this is an aluminum
heatsink with a fan integrated oh no
that's gonna be noisy as shit for your
m2 SSD according to x PG 25% schooler is
what you can expect when it comes to
temperatures on your little and vme SSD
that's compared of course to a bear m2
SSD with no active cooling or heatsink
or anything on it some scenarios might
see even better cooling like if you have
a fan pointed at it - or something like
that's but it does have the standard 4
pin RGB connection so makes it
compatible with Asus or a sync gigabyte
RGB fusion MSI mystic like for example I
was going to point out they have
different various various ways of
connecting it such as the direct PSU
connection in which case it would have a
standard RGB aesthetic which I imagine
would just be sort of an RGB cycle or
you can plug it in with the RGB control
wire and then you can sync it up with
the rest of your stuff but I imagine of
our viewers is probably tons of people
immediately buying this that's my
expectation on you you know all right
let's move on to swordfight we're gonna
have a little bit of a an arguments here
as we briefly discuss EA's recent fight
milk somewhat recent
to clarify this kind of blow-up earlier
today it's not that recent as far as the
firing goes but it does reflect on EA's
recent actions when it comes to the
games that they have acquired whether
they've developed them in-house or
whether they have purchased other
development houses and then done
whatever the hell they want to with
their actual intellectual property so
George fan was one of the original
creators of plants vs. zombies he was
laid off by EA back in 2012 actually he
worked for PopCap PopCap was acquired by
EA and then they went and fired 50
PopCap employees in 2012 he also
coincidentally unrelated Lee is against
a lot of EA's decisions when it comes to
the pay2win model sort of model of
plants vs. zombies too that's what EA
did with the popular title of plants vs.
zombies they made plants vs. zombies -
there was a lot more geared towards
making money than it was being a fun
game to play and it not doing as well
but of course still made money for EAS
EA so assumably presumably they were
happy again the termination of his
employment did not coincide with his
feelings towards the freemium model
scene and plants vs. zombies -
nevertheless we're gonna argue wait
sorry why are we talking about it if it
happen in 2012 because me up as a story
because there was an interview about it
where it was discussed and suddenly it
became like oh EA fired this guy because
he disagreed with their free-to-play
model so this is the first time I'm
spending what they're paid it they're
there because he disagreed with their
pay to win mod model but no no it but it
was a misunderstanding so that became
the story they fired him because of that
but then he tweeted about it and then
more people who were involved followed
up about it
and it was clarified no he was fired
along with 50 other PopCap employees
because because EA is shitty and they
bought PopCap and then they fired a
bunch of their employees including the
creator of one of the most popular games
that that was made so this recent
article is just saying this recent
article isn't who says he would sort of
read it's sort of resurfacing this okay
originally it was yes the story was ei
fired him because he disagreed with
their pain um one model for plants
versus zombies - right since then it was
clarified that's not why he was fired
okay but EA still bought PopCap and took
plants vs. zombie is an awesome game and
made shitty follows it follow-ups to it
in the EA style so what we're gonna
argue about here is what popular game EA
should target next which popular game or
game franchise should he a purchase and
then L we ruin and we have several oh
man we got the Grand Theft Auto
franchise from Rockstar the minecraft
gram franchise from I guess it's
minecraft game for Mojang now and by
Microsoft I already know what I'm
choosing Final Fantasy of course Super
Mario Brothers Pokemon I'm player
unknowns battlegrounds League of Legends
and I added an other there because of
course there are many many other options
here EA would kill to get to acquire the
Pokemon company and make that pay to win
because you just got a bunch of like
typically it attracts a younger crowd
and that's not to say that older people
don't play it - I know it's immensely
popular with older crowds and stuff I'd
play pokemon right now if I had a de
essence it's like but I couldn't yet I
can imagine
EA trying to target that I mean plants
vs. zombies a lot of younger people play
that too and younger people will younger
people who have the money who have like
an allowance or whatever or you know
young kids are getting credit cards for
kidding left and right it was crazy I
know I know kids again it's it's madness
it's managed time limit I think you've
exhibited more like old dude stuff today
that I've seen you do in a while my hair
is thinning out I'm getting this
receiving here what's happening you know
I can't stay awake after 10:00 p.m. it's
it's it's a problem I'm getting old it's
happening and so I feel like Pokemon is
a prime target it's a prime target for
ei they're gonna attack all the little
kids little kids
their daddy's credit cards and stuff
just making all these micro transactions
on simple dollar here dollar dollar
their kids obsess more than anyone else
on average about video games and winning
right and I think pokemons a great start
it's a great thing to attack and go
after I mean the other ones too I could
see you know Minecraft obviously a lot
of younger kids play that too I'm sure a
lot of your kids play League of Legends
Pokemon though is something that's it's
been around for so much longer than any
of these other IPs
to be honest that I could see it just
being a game changer for yeah it could
be one of their most lucrative IPs get
when it comes to micro transactions and
a pay to win model those kids are
competitive I tell ya they're
competitive shit okay I have various
thoughts when it comes to the sexual
arguments like should I choose the thing
that I think will actually win should I
choose the thing that I think will be
the least detrimental to like society as
a whole if VA Brad were to actually go
and destroy one of these beloved you
know intellectual properties or
franchises or whatever ultimately I want
to go with what I think is maybe the
most actually functionally practical
which would be player nouns
battlegrounds yes on the one hand super
popular right now so I think there's
lots of people who who are invested in
enough in to that they'd be like oh
that's the game I play I'm gonna vote
for that second blue hole you know
relatively unknown game developer prior
to now you know this is their first
breakout hit and everything so I feel
like that is kind of one of the the
aspects of that might make them a little
bit more susceptible to a buyout or
something like that so practically
speaking oh yeah you know maybe that's
something that's more you know you take
something like you know rock star or
Square Enix and a Nintendo or whatever
like they're not going to be bought out
like right there never know yeah
Nintendo's never going to sell the Super
Mario Brothers property granted I'm sure
you and be happy to buy it and destroy
it yeah and
maybe people want that to happen but
there you go so I'm going to say a
player knows battlegrounds and let's see
yeah it seems the most practical see
what you guys have to say about this one
boom I was a great win oh my god Pub gee
you win yeas player noon this pentagrams
piays player nuns bella grands oh ii
doubt it's like you got to pay $1 every
time do you want it you want to dive out
of the plane like you can you can join
any game you want or even the plane was
a go fuck that like combine that with
the all the early access bugs no plane
early like you have to wait an extra 30
seconds on the plane unless you pay the
dollar which you have the option to do
every single time half the time and
night then a bunch of people get a
30-second head start on getting a weapon
and that's and that's exactly this is
another reason why EA would want to buy
them up is because half the time with
while it's still in early access
I can barely jump out of the plane and
pub G without it crashing on me which
would mean I'd just be racking up the
dough playing crappy every time no the
plan doesn't cry the game crash the game
crashes buddy system are you playing on
because that never happens to me the
only system that oh oh oh ok there you
go
I get some random ass crashes of the
puppy really how often do you play pub G
though I've been benchmarking it a
decent amount and I haven't had any
crashes but ok I don't know I'm sure
there's other parts you'll it'll it'll
come around alright and now for the
title segments wait wait hold on hold on
I'm not ready not ready give me about 10
seconds I have to click this 1 2 3 4 5 6
7 8 9 10
ok seconds those are just numbers well
since you first said that sentence it's
been about 7 seconds now you're right
and now you have now we're ready in 2
now it's 10 second for
hey that was that are you guys impressed
with all of Paul's preparation for that
war so happy so happy for that all right
the sacraments him my way way way too
loud don't do that that echo lol I'm
deaf I have a boner okay interesting
people people Steve okay everyone's
reacting a little bit differently than
that okay that will circle back to it
first off look into it
I'm tales from space the first-ever
interstellar visitor I don't know if
that can be confirmed but the first ever
recorded interstellar visitors to our
solar system is this thing right here
what does that mean he's from a
different it's outside of our solar
outside of our solar solar system this
is the first object from outside of our
solar south side of our solar system
that we've recorded entering our solar
system really typically what we see is
you know comments on asteroids whatever
that are all from within our solar
system wow this is a cigar-shaped
asteroid that's been tracked since
mid-october and automated sat telescopes
spotted its it appeared as if it had
been dropped into the solar system from
above at an angle so that suggests that
it comes from outside of our solar
system
elsewhere in space so a team of
Australian astronomer has rushed out a
paper on this object they've named it
one l / 2017 u1 oh ma sorry Oh mwah mwah
it's fine if my if my Hawaiian is with
me Oh mwah mwah
roughly means first messenger
sure the 1l indicates that it's the
first interstellar object that's been
recorded by modern astronomers it passed
between the Sun and the orbit of mercury
is it can kind of see right here drop
down see it's coming down
most of our circles are this way this
one's coming down from like a like where
the hell did you come from so fast
between the orbits of mercury and the
Sun dropped down and then came back up
and passed out between the orbits of
Mars and Earth so how close did you get
to earth within a mile I just saw it
like you know like a Tele yeah it was a
plane and those like the asteroid right
next to it they were like side-by-side
it was not close to Earth at all no
there was never any concern of it
actually encountering or is there
anything the main you know thing to talk
about here is that it is it is an extra
extra solar system old object I just
made that crazy extra solar system old
object and it is cigar shaped of course
of coral is a technical phrase for cigar
shaped is a tri-axial ellipsoid which
measures 80
vais call it cigar shaped and pole 80 by
80 by 100 meters as far as the length is
that a thousand meter I'm sorry anybody
by a thousand meters I was gonna say are
you reading on vase amounting yeah
standards so it's going to look like a
couple football fields which is pretty
crazy it's spinning very quickly and it
emits a faint red glow but it changes
due to the do the rotation of it so over
a seven point three hour period the
amount of light reflected from the
object changes by a factor of over two
point five is there any chance of us
like sending it something out there to
gather probably not because this kind of
dropped in unexpectedly in a weird angle
and I wasn't there wasn't enough time to
like you know launch on its trajectory
and launched something like an intrepid
for Mt
of like you know the the used they
usually do oil drilling and like extreme
environments but they were hired by the
government to go like up to this
asteroid to drill for some special metal
or substance that sounds like you're
getting pretty conspiracy theory on me
right I'm just trying to write a
blockbuster movie like a summer just
there just add Kurt Russell yeah it'll
be an instant wait so what if this is
like finally aliens are trying to
contact us with this asteroid they
literally just like threw it down in the
horse is like you're look there's like a
very deep and coded message like yes to
this and we'll never see it this is our
one sound like a chancer I've got
spaceship or anything with technology
it's just it's rock it's a paper plane
that they just threw in but it's got a
message nice it's like a very dense rock
because they specifically were comparing
it to like a comet when a comment goes
around the Sun it heats up and it vents
a bunch of gas and stuff like that it
vented ten million times less matter
than you would expect to see vented by a
comet and so it is it's more like an
asteroid or just a rocket dense cigar
shaped rock sometimes a big cigar shaped
rock is just a big cigar shaped Rock Cal
rock hard rock nice alright
earthquakes maybe there will be more
earthquakes next year what do you think
everyone keeps saying that we're due for
a big one here in Southern California
that was to be I mean it's been a while
everyone's like we know wow
we'd probably do like don't say that so
just to clarify this is a space.com
article and they like to use you know
and related language from time to time
so I want to I want to be more clear
here so this is based on the study of
periods of slow rotation of the earth
over the last one 100 years which is a
regular and recurring thing a tiny slow
down and
it's rotation next year a tiny slowdown
Anas Earth's rotation could potentially
trigger more earthquakes than usual as
indicated by this article changes in
Earth's rotational speed can be caused
by weather patterns like El Nino ocean
currents as well as currents in the
molten core of the planet apparently
when the the fluids in the planet speed
up the solid parts of the earth's
slowdown like the Earth's crust for
example as the Earth spins slows
slightly the equator shrinks because the
earth is an oblate spheroid as you all
know obviously and as it spins around
the part in the middle it's bit fatter
because it's spinning right so it spins
and centrifugal force fatter in the
middle so a slight slowdown of that spin
would cause the fat part in middle to be
less fat which which which shrinks it
down a little bit the tectonic plates
though that make up the Earth's crust
don't shrink down so easily so the added
stress can lead to an increased chance
of earthquakes on average there's about
15 major earthquakes per year at least
since modern record-keeping has been
going on and since about 1900 but during
certain periods the planet sees more
like 25 to 35 earthquakes greater than
magnitude 7 per year so going from 15 to
25 or 35 is a pretty significant
increase and according to this study
those increases in earthquakes also
correlates to the slowdown of the
Earth's rotation as caused by the
previously mentioned factors NASA tracks
the length of the day to the
microseconds so the slowdowns in the
Earth's spin can be predicted five years
in advanced based on that data the earth
is entering entering a period of
prolonged slow rotation and as a result
might be more earthquakes next year
something of great concern to us here in
Southern California is where as as well
as I'm sure many other areas around
earth that are near two major fault
lines but um yeah well those Doomsday
Preppers are probably freaking out
that's gonna be done I hope we don't all
die there we go let's move to something
more visually appealing Jupiter has a
bunch of clouds and storms constantly
going on and this is really cool picture
of this storm on Jupiter that was
recently captured by the Juno spacecraft
this was captured on October 21st I'm
sorry October 24th it was taken when
Juno was six thousand two hundred and
eighty-one miles or ten thousand 108
kilometers from the planets cloud tops
in the northern hemisphere of Jupiter
the image scale is 4.2 miles per pixel
Wow so every pixel in this image is four
point two miles across or six point
seven kilometers resembles the swirling
past out passed out clouds of a Vincent
van Gogh painting starry night perhaps
yes sort of sort of evocative of the
star van Gogh yes of course and excuse
me pardon my french
the storm is rotating counterclockwise
it's a wide range of cloud altitudes the
darker clouds are expected to be deeper
in the atmosphere than the brightest
clouds will sure so there you go Wow
excellent new wallpaper for any of you
guys trippy a17 for your phone
forget Jupiter final story here on tales
from space a 61 year old DIY enthusiast
and stuntman named Mad Mike Hughes Mike
youth he's planning his first man's
launch of a homemade 20,000 steam
powered rocket went with research Flat
Earth written on the side launched on
Saturday this picture here is a is an
orbital ATK Antares rocket has nothing
to do with that this actually he's gonna
he's gonna surf on a rocket they easily
he's really on a rocket he's gonna be
it's it's a manned rocket mission he's
actually controlling I have no the
article doesn't really detail any actual
research that might be
or information that might get gathered
by someone who is as as mad Mike Hughes
is an admitted flat earther he will
launch into the skies above the Mojave
Desert ghost town of Amboy that up to
500 miles per hour for roughly one mile
attaining a peak altitude altitude of
1,800 feet before the rocket deploys two
parachutes so so that's kinda
fascinating he has been known to do this
in the past in fact there's several
YouTube videos linked in the article for
instance this rocket launch that he did
before he got a Guinness World Record in
2002 for jumping 102 feet and a Lincoln
Towncar stretch limo that's his day job
is he's a limo driver this is his other
rocket launch a steam rocket flight from
2014 went up 1374 feets look at that
parachute it's all busted yeah the
parachute looks like it's not in the
best shape here sure this lowered it
seems to be plenty of holes in there oh
my god although it did appear to be a
successful flight it did are certifiably
insane
it didn't have three days of recovery
time in the hospital due to the extreme
g-forces and the ref descent from from
that flight there there's something very
troubling about one of the one of the
comments in your doc notes here
what's that says Hughes does not believe
in science what she told the AP has no
difference from science fiction yeah
leads me to believe that this guy is not
just some savant or some genius
scientist he's just kind of Spacey so
alright so he's actually he's either
crazy and stupid or he's just someone
who knows he can say crazy things to get
attention and hey we're talking about
him right now so maybe that's working
this event simultaneously serves also as
the launch of his California gurbin
gubernatorial campaign
he's running for governor of California
but our our great state here on the west
coast of the United States so maybe this
is just a publicity stunt or maybe he
believes the things he's actually saying
I mean you got to be a little bit stupid
to be like a crazy stunt man he says I
know about aerodynamics and fluid
dynamics and how things move through the
air about certain size of rocket nozzles
and thrust but that's not science that's
just a formula there's no difference
between science and science fiction yeah
he's great he's ready too many books
yeah did we mention he's a flat earther
oh he's a flat earth in the chain yeah
that's kind of the breeze cut over the
headlines flat earther okay you didn't
catch that at the beginning no I know he
believes versus what okay well okay that
makes perfect sense
all right so the earth is totally flat
that wraps up our tales from space we're
surfing on a pancake in space we're just
like whoo Earth's a pan or a big cigar
do see this guy yeah all right let us
wrap up today's show with some Q&amp;amp;A we
got some donation comments have come in
Lord I've burped a little bit there
sorry about that righteous all right
first off from wait did we get Gerald
five bucks Thank You gerald if you're
watching also I think Grim Reaper we
forgot Grim Reaper grim reaper 1080 with
the five bucks I always miss the pen my
PC messages only I think we did we do
him forever
cool thank you the wrong price nine or
wrist nine wrist I have a ten
Argentinian our Australian sorry hey you
guys keep with a good work hey Paul
how's the new wheels new wheels are
drinks BEM Trek I really love my new
truck it's really fun to drive I need to
have more thing I need to come up with
more things to carry
around in it but thank you for your
donation five bucks
salutations gents by a new 1080p monitor
is 32 inch too big should I go with 27
inch thanks guys much love for male jefe
I personally think 27 is probably the
better option just because I feel like
anything larger than that it starts to
feel I would not quite as crisp I would
try to keep an eye out for in 27-inch
1440 I think that's a good solution
there yeah if it's in the budget
definitely go with 14 32 is definitely
too big for 1080 everything is so huge
yeah it's just I'd say it's poised e32
if you go above 27 inches I'd say 1440p
or 4k it very least yeah
Gerald gerald $5 hiya fellas might I
suggest a streamer to raid lil red Hydra
I'm sure she would appreciate a nice
awesome hardware raid / love that is all
Cheers so if you feel like it is a good
idea to host this little red Hydra then
by all means let us know down below in
the doc he's already got somebody else
signed up okay well then this cool
little to sell that I said you know yes
your home's his moods change with the
wind so you know he's very mysterious
Shazzer be three one four nine one five
dollars should I buy a $350 Dell 1440p
144 Hertz g-sync TN monitor on Black
Friday if I have a 1050 TI but looking
to upgrade eventually when GPU prices
fall cesare saw that deal that's a crazy
deal it's been leaked out they're very
very low price for the size refresh rate
and resolution of that monitor nice and
it's TN but it's still an amazing deal
but yeah and I also feel like TNS but TN
I mean if you want if you want those
other specs at that at at 1440 and 144
Hertz and gsync for $350 it's gonna be
TN I cannot get any get away from that
yeah and TN I mean there's a variety of
TN panels and some are better than
others so I would say yeah I mean if you
got the money go for it that's a very
nice upgrade you can you can do G sink
with 1050 Ti and a lower power
graphics card is actually a very good
combination with g-sync
because you can can I get the most out
of it for your money and if you're
planning on upgrading your GPU to in the
future yeah
I'd say I'd say that's it go for it try
to look at the quality in person before
you buy that listen to Kylie's do it but
yeah if you can if you can't take a look
in person definitely that's worth it too
for sure Scott Dilbeck you see I wasn't
66 cents have a good Thanksgiving guys
who else agrees that they should make a
new timesplitters game I love time
splitters back in the day I played that
straight all the time specifically time
splitters to on GameCube I played with
my friends by myself all the time yeah
that'd be it that was a great game it
was a good first-person shooter I've
never played had really good multiplayer
play and there was like also a map
editor use like one of the first FPS is
where you could create your own map and
and play with friends in it and stuff
who's well based on what Cal has said
just now I completely agree and say yeah
100%
thank you Scott Steven hill I'm not the
only person who likes manual trucks with
four-wheel drive on an unrelated note
keep up with the content gentlemen Thank
You Steven thank you it was excellent to
see you on Saturday and I follow you on
twitter now Jota sure Ted hopefully the
net stays free and I can afford to keep
supporting you guys keep a tional here
Kyle don't even have to say it twice you
drink too much and might wear out your
ID Jenn to rise and soon I were kind of
hoping we're kind of hoping 20 20 18
might show us some Zen to based stuff
cute my you my guess would be probably
you know around coputex be but it's
still really early we haven't heard too
many rumors at all but things crossed
hopefully here soon
Tyler forums where a $5 just an idea you
guys could auction off your extra
hardware when you do the charity stream
and donate proceeds keep up the good
work guys Tyler that is a consideration
but we're mostly going to be our
optioning off the two systems that we
are we've built my system is a entry
level shredder per system which has
1,900 X as well as a bunch of other
really awesome hard Hardware is that
your only 1900 X yeah I bought it
I've only got one y really got one did
you get a 1900 I did yeah I mean I don't
think they did much sampling in the 1900
X yeah but um that's a good CPU though
yeah I mean it's very solid CPU and the
sense of gender per the overclocking on
it's like even running it stock out of
the box it was hitting for for one or
for two gigahertz on a single or a
couple cores which is pretty nice it's
got an inner max BlueTEC liquid CPU
cooler and a gtx 1070 TI from ZOTAC so
it's very solid system and the search
panel system is gonna be equally epic it
will be equally better great yes that's
probably gonna be slightly better ever
slightly better than mine equally better
all right machine beats you 10 bucks
what camera do you guys use to stream
quality is nice gh4 thank you - right
now GH 5 is the camera but a GH 4 would
work just fine as well the capture card
is the Blackmagic 4k ro intensity pro or
just just just like a black magic for
can capture on my channel and I have the
PCIe right yeah it's a PCI Express 1 and
it captures in 4k so yeah it captures in
4k but we're capturing at 1080 60 right
now which is what's nice and sharp is
the 60fps but yeah it's a good
combination for order sexy I need one of
those Steven we are men five bucks
Windows 10 creators update has an app
for Dolby Atmos and a $15.00 option for
simulated at most for any headphones if
you have tried it what do you think I
have not and after Dolby Atmos
I have I have not tried that all I feel
like a $15.00 is a lot to spend for
something like that like yeah you're
gonna be a serious Auto audiophile with
with like the cans to back it up to back
up the justification it's the software
thing
and if it's part of the update yeah yeah
I'd wait for some reviews on that and
some feedback on that to flow out before
actually buying it up
I already couldn't provide more info
coal tender $5 hey could two gtx 970 SS
CS or super super clocked sli run all
games of 2560 by 1080 just wondering
just got a second card and was wondering
you should be good I think you'll be
fine you might hit I mean doesn't
support you know you might hit a memory
cap at some point cuz you are limited I
kind of 3.5 total still on that but 2560
by 1080 isn't that high of resolution so
you're probably gonna be good for the
most part if anything you might have to
disable certain filters that eat up a
lot of Ihram yeah
and you should be okay just run you know
run some software where you can keep an
eye on GPU memory usage like precision X
or MSI Afterburner or something like
that and check it out with the games
that you play and see if that's actually
an issue that you're encountering um but
yeah I think I think that actually would
be a pretty decent combination for
resolution and GPU yeah and I should
we've mentioned a million times but if
you have the option one single faster
graphics card is always gonna be better
than two slower ones yeah in SLI or
crossfire
Alex Weber $5 Paul Kyle I built my first
PC last week thanks to you would love to
meet some new people honestly since I
have no PC friends
