guys for some help because I've been
kind of gradually stumbling my way along
the road to becoming an audiophile I
know it takes a lot of work and a lot of
practice but to that end I have a new
product here this is the AKG K 553 pro
headphones by Harman and I'm gonna be
testing them out a little bit today kind
of giving you guys my experience and
you'll also have a chance to win one of
these simply by clicking a link and
entering your information so stay tuned
for how to do that as well so these
headphones kind of meet an interesting
little midpoint I think between the
amateur and the audiophile between the
consumer and the prosumer and I think
they're actually pretty well suited for
at least my spot along this road I've
tried some higher-end headphones but I'm
definitely not one who's tried every
single one out there on the market at a
553 start at an MSRP of $300 although
the street price right now is about $200
and if you get these on mass drop via
the link that I put down in the
description they're only 140 bucks right
now so if you're looking for headphones
not a headset if you're looking for
something for gaming as well as for
audio playback music listening of course
and giving yourself just a better
experience overall than say what you
might get down in the 5200 dollar range
especially if you're going for like
gaming Orient's or peripherals
I think these provide a better
experience and definitely something that
are worth looking into if you're looking
for new headphones right now well they
give you a wide audio bandwidth that 12
Hertz to 28 kilohertz range as opposed
to the 20 Hertz to 20 kilohertz that a
lot of headphones offer well-balanced
sound quality and we'll be coming back
to that these do provide a little bit
more kick on the low end a little bit
more bass than you might be accustomed
to for just kind of your flat tuned
headphones but I think as a results they
do give you a better experience and it's
not the type of like super bass II
experience that you get where they're
just trying to muddle everything else by
adding a lot of bass it's actually stays
pretty crisp you get a 2d access full
plant mechanism that means the
headphones themselves can fold and so
you can lay them down flat
they don't fold up for portability so
that is one shortcoming of these if
you're looking to take these on the road
they don't have a carrying case and they
don't fold up very well so maybe not the
best rode gear but if you did get a nice
case for them they could
they still make the trip also at the end
of the very long cord which isn't
braided or anything fancy like that but
does this have a gold-plated eight inch
jack or it comes with a quarter inch
adapter that screws on and stays nice
and secure and also looks quite nice so
depending on what you're connecting it
to it's nice to have both of those
options apart from that these are an
over ear design so that's going to give
you lots of comfort they have these very
large but not oversized leatherette pads
not real leather but they're still very
comfortable and when you're putting them
on they have a pretty decent clamping
factor so they're gonna get right around
your ears and then these are a closed
design although there's semi-open so
whereas they are actually closed and
they will block out some outside noise
the sound stage of the presence e you
get while you have them on it's still
more towards open so you don't get that
inside your head kind of feel that you
get with fully closed design headphones
now Campbell by the way is three meters
or 9.8 feet and then the weight of these
is 305 grams or 10.7 five ounces which
is not too heavy again they're not
oversized or anything like that so in my
experience wearing them for a good hour
plus they don't get difficult to wear
they don't cause discomfort over time or
anything like that granted I have a
slightly larger than average sized head
so bear that in mind if your head is
very large or very small then you might
need a specially designed headset sorry
I'm sorry if your heads not the right
size the drivers themselves are 50
millimeters they produce excellent
excellent sound and again with that with
that sort of faux open soundstage that
they're going with here it actually
gives you a pretty good idea of where
things are at so if you're planning on
using these for gaming you can actually
use them and as far as like the depth
that it gives you that that openness of
where the noise is coming from it's a
great option for if you're looking for
like being able to hear people sneaking
up behind you and a fps or something
like that 50 millimeter drivers are
included and then apart from that
physically these again have those very
large ear cups they should go around
most anyone's ears unless you have very
very large years that would be strange
the finish on the outside you'll notice
there's a lot of metal you got sort of a
circular brushed metal look over on the
side of the ear cups by the AKG
professional studio headphones logos
says
k55 three Pro up near the top of that
and then the band across the top is all
metal I love metal bands anytime there's
a heavy phone or headset that does not
have metal bands I get mad at it because
I assume they're gonna break overtime
not a whole lot of padding on the top
but I didn't seem to notice that too
much they still stayed fairly
comfortable so build quality these seem
very nice and again the fact that you
can flip them out like that and you also
have very large L&amp;amp;R indicators so you
immediately know which side left and
right is makes it a little bit more
flexible for if you need to set them
down on the table or something like that
that's kind of useful going back to use
case scenarios the impedance rated
impedance of these headphones is 32 ohms
ohms and the reason that is important is
because that's pretty standard for most
headphones that means if you're using it
with something like a cell phone for
example to take on the go you're not
going to need anything like an inline
amplifier or something like this that
said you can use them with an amplifier
and with an improved sound source you
are going to get an improved sound
signal so but just just nice to have
that flexibility again to be able to
take them on the road and just connect
them up to your phone or if you're
sitting in the studio space somewhere
you can easily connect them up to a
higher quality sound system and gets
very very nice sound so to sum up the K
553 pros offer you excellent sound
reproduction across the board these are
pretty well balanced and they're gonna
give you definitely a big step up from
especially if you've been using like 80
to $100 headset you're going to notice a
big boost in sound reproduction clarity
especially the impact when it comes to
especially at not on that base side
again these push the base a little bit
more without it being overpowering or
muddled for example and then as far as
the comfort goes I'm confident that you
could wear these for hours on end
they're really well constructed they're
very sturdy and then the fact that
they're only 3200 impedance means you're
gonna have a wide range of compatibility
for whatever your listening device or
your music source happens to be all of
that and mass drop you can get these now
for 140 bucks so again click that link
in the description and if you aren't
going to necessarily buy these right now
but you might be interested in possibly
winning one go ahead and click that link
anyway sign up for mass drop every
clicks that link is automatically going
to be entered and signs up of course
you're gonna be entered to win a pair of
these from master ah so they're just
gonna do that I think after 10 days
they'll notify you and maybe you'll get
a free pair so go ahead and do that and
while you're at it down there go ahead
and leave me some feedback hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video or hit the thumbs down button if
you think headphones are stupid and no
one should wear them also leave me a
comment in the comment section down
below and let me know what other
headphones in this range say hundred
fifty to two hundred dollars you might
be interested in me taking a closer look
at because that is something that I'm
interested again in broadening my
horizons and it's something that I could
probably check in on that's all for
today though guys and as always thanks
