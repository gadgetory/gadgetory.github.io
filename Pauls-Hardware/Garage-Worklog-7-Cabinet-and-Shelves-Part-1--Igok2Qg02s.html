another Paul's hardware garage worklog
I'm very excited about today's video but
first I need to say a huge and massive
thank you to all of you guys out there
who have subscribed to my channel
whether you're a longtime subscriber or
a recent subscriber and just yesterday
hit 200 200 K 200 thousand subscribers
I'm amazingly humbled and thankful and
all that stuff so thanks you guys for
subscribing and thanks for liking the
videos and all that good stuff it is
your feedback that sustains me and
drives me to make more videos but
speaking of which I have been sort of
proceeding with the garage project for
quite some time now today I'm very
excited about what I'm actually going to
be trying to accomplish and just up
front there's a good chance this video
is gonna be split into two parts because
I have a pretty good amount of stuff to
do now I can see what I'm doing maybe
I'll make the camera less shaky okay so
here's my work area and what's next for
this is gonna be some shelves I'm also
gonna put some sound dampening at least
a row of saying sound dampening about at
the same level as the microphones in the
back so that's probably gonna go just
under the shelves and maybe above it and
then I'm also gonna paint back here and
do some stuff like covering up the wall
sockets and that kind of thing but
that's not what I'm working on today no
I have to do another order of operations
in the order of it oh my gosh look how
responsible I'm being this is an Acer
predator x34 I've actually taken this
out of the box already
I've actually shot some b-roll with it
and it's sitting over there neglected
and unused right right there I should be
playing Starcraft legacy of the void on
it or maybe some fallout 4 but I'm not
I'm trying to be responsible and move on
with the project that I told myself I
was gonna do I'm working on this area
over here today perhaps less glamorous
but very required this is all just
storage stuff I've actually massively
cleaned up this this area here as of
yesterday so here's what I'm doing today
first off where this little shelf is I'm
gonna make a cabinet a stand-up cabinet
about eight foot tall and it's going to
open up and that's gonna hold like a lot
of my camera gear and like production
equipment and that kind of thing so
that's going to take that's gonna be
about three foot wide right there and
then for the rest of this wall space
over here which isn't doing a whole lot
right now I'm going to be putting in
these shelves I have
pretty good idea to use shelf standards
and to put the shelves in I told chest
should fitting right below it I'm gonna
do a little bit of pegboard up here and
then this pretty cool idea for shelves
and stuff that I found online and I'll
post the link to where I got the idea in
the video description anyway let's go to
Home Depot
okay
Home Depot wood plywood even all that
plywood that's a lot of it sorry I can't
keep them focus here look I got a pocket
hole jig some trimmer line need some new
trimmer line hardware for the doors and
everything I got some pegboard mixed-up
plywood gotta get some plywood made out
of ripped gonna rip some thyroid
I can answer that age-old question of
how much plywood can you fit into a
2-door Honda Accord that much about that
much Hey look at my haul of course all
that plywood basically this is five
total pieces of 4 foot by 8 foot plywood
that's cut into strips so I had them cut
into foot and a half wide strips that
way and then these are just the
remainders that I'm also gonna be using
for some pieces these are very thin
strips I had them cut into about three
and a half inch long strips so those are
what's gonna be mounted to the wall over
there
and then to those I mount these guys
which are called shelf standards and
then they have all those these little
things that pop into them so that makes
it kind of modular and you can move the
shelves around and stuff I'm only gonna
get that started for today really my
main focus here is that cabinet so the
foot and a half pieces are gonna be the
two side this side so it's gonna be
about a foot and a half deep coming up
from the wall over there and then it's
gonna be about three feet wide with foot
and a half wide closing doors opening
and closing doors and now I'm at the
like what's next what should I do next
point I guess the answer is I should
throw the ball for nori right okay now I
hit her in the nose we usually don't
play ball in the garage so out here
behind the garage I have set up my my
old table the one right there
that's like it it's like 15 or 20 years
old I've had that for so long but I'm
still alive and kicking basically I need
to I need to cut three more of those to
that with I need to cut three shelves in
one top piece that are also that width
it's tough for the top piece which is a
little bit lighter these two pieces that
have birch on the front so I'm gonna
have be the actual doors I'm also gonna
maybe hopefully router the router the
size of those and put a little beveled
edge on the inside do a bit of sanding I
want to get everything cut out here I
also need to cut the shelves of course
and I need to notch
the two side pieces in the bottom where
they go up against this at the garage
door I'm hopefully going to get
everything cut out here and set up
because it's already starting to Sunbury
start to go down and then I can sort of
just assemble everything inside
alright guys it is Sunday now and I need
to wrap this video up because I keep I
keep getting hounded by the thought of I
have not posted a video yet this week ah
so this one's going to go up it is going
to be a two-parter so as you can see I'm
still in process of the work here just
to recap on Fridays when I started this
video and I got a pretty good amount of
work done I did I did my shopping and I
did a bunch of wood cutting cutting down
to size and sanding and that kind of
thing yesterday was Saturday and I was
distracted pretty significantly because
I've decided to purchase a new car or at
least a new to me car and that that kind
of took away from some of the time but I
did get in here yesterday and I started
to assemble this whole thing as you
probably saw in the time-lapse so it's
really big it's really tall these two
shelves are installed roof there at the
top of it is is is connected up there
with with nails going all along edges
these are connected with nails on the
sides as well as along the back on the
support there the bottom piece is still
just sitting there in place I haven't
connected that or connected up either
side which is why it's still bowing out
a little bit at the bottom because both
of these side pieces had some pretty
significant Belling going on with them
my technique for assembling this thing
was a to not plan ahead as much as I
should have so there are certain things
I would have liked to have done like
there's there's more shelves than what's
what's going on in here that I'm
planning to install and I should have
started out with those in mind so I
could have done some pre drilling stuff
on the sides and whatnot but I you know
I you got to push forward sometimes so I
had to push forward so we're starting
with three shelves and a roof this
bottom one's going to get connected
mounted up and then I also built this
and with a specific goal in mind which
is that I'm building it directly under
the wall but some you notice these three
by two cross beams that are supporting
it these are illustrated at the stud
that's back there but if I ever did want
to remove this entire thing and perhaps
shift it down another wall or move it
over to the other side of the garage or
anything I should in theory
be able to remove four screws the four
that are here the four there and the
beam there and then the four there and
the beam up there and this whole thing
should be able to come off of the wall
and be able to shift around and move in
whatever here's a look at one of the
doors just kind of propped in place the
doors are also plywood but they're birch
plywood which costs just a few bucks
more and has a nicer finish on it and
this one I went to the trouble of
sanding and also I use my router to go
right along the edge here sorry I'm
using autofocus so I don't know how well
focused this is also of these shelves
are almost almost completely leveled but
coming up very soon on Paul's next
garage work log I'm gonna clear all this
stuff out I'm going to paint this wall I
need and gonna get some more gray paint
I might go a little bit lighter but it's
gonna be mostly the same color now paint
that whole lot I'm actually gonna paint
the entire frame of this that same color
at the same time I'm also going to do
some caulk and seal up around the edges
in the back in the front I know that may
make it hard to pull the thing off the
wall later but I got a seal that up if I
want dusts to get not get in there at
least as little dust as possible so I'm
gonna paint this whole front thing and
then they these front doors that are
birch I'm and leave the natural wood
finish so sticking with the kind of gray
and wood and black theme I guess which I
kind of like matches pretty well so
let's have a lot of work to do I'm gonna
be kicking into high gear today or maybe
later today and tomorrow and working
more on this so stay tuned
I really have another garage work log
coming up very very soon thanks for
watching this video guys again thanks
for bearing with me as well through all
of these transitional times as I said I
have going on as I work on the garage
and update things I know it's gonna be
awesome once I get it all finished or at
least as finished as it's gonna be for
me to move on to the next stage I don't
