welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is actually going to be part one
of a two-part video I'm actually pretty
excited about this one because my idea
was to look at maybe next-gen gaming to
some extent it's all about 4k that's
what you've probably been hearing a lot
about so far and chances are you guys
might be considering moving up to a 4k
monitor my idea was right now what is
the best reasonable 4k solution that you
can come up with now and a reasonable is
sort of a relative term so this might
not make sense to everyone out there
because the hardware I'm going to be
using is definitely somewhat expensive
however it is not over-the-top expensive
so the idea was to take the best cards
available from AMD as well as Nvidia to
basically put them in the best situation
possible and then see how they perform a
4k resolution when testing games now I
also kind of threw in a few curveballs
into the mix here because well for one
thing you might notice I've got a couple
what appear to be r9 290x is in front of
me but these are actually just the
coolers so it's one of the issues that
came up when the 290x first came out was
that the cooler was not quite up to task
when it comes to cooling down this card
since it is meant to run at a very high
temperature so today's video is going to
be all about giving the r9 290x the best
possible shot at giving us some really
excellent performance with 4k gaming
since that is what AMD designed for to
that end I will be installing these two
coolers over here so we have the NZXT
kraken or krey-kin
g10 however you prefer that
pronunciation those are the coolers
themselves and these are meant to work
with in any ace tec cooler or a long
list of ACE tech specific coolers so for
those I have the Kraken or kraken x40
down below so this video is going to be
my removal of these heatsink fans
installation of this Hardware here and
kind of a once-over of that part to
video is going to be the real meat of it
where I'm actually going to be showing
you guys performance testing with a
couple 290 X's in a two-way crossfire as
well as well the best card of it
currently available from Nvidia which is
the gtx titan black so there's that guy
right there and since I've got two 290
X's as well
I guess I might as well do two Titan
blacks as well so those are going to be
thrown into the mix but that's all
coming soon in part two of this video so
I guess I'd better get to work
but for now let's take a look at me
doing the installation procedure I
should say removal of the heatsink fans
as well as the installation procedure
for the kraken g10 and the kraken x40 so
we'll start with a look at the craic in
x4 t and g 10 units themselves the X 40
is a 140 millimeter closed-loop cooler
originally designed for CPU use as you
can see here it comes with a two-year
warranty over on the back you have some
marketing text and some pretty pictures
ooh
16 inch tubing also an efficiency chart
and a surface area diagram it's larger
and it's quieter and it's more effective
than 120 millimeter counterparts CPU
socket compatibility list is right here
that's something that's actually useful
what's not mentioned here compatibility
with the Radeon r9 290x kinda nice
detailed specs are also listed on the
other side and next is the Kraken g10
kraken g10 whichever which will be
allowing me to attach this CPU
closed-loop cooler to a graphics card
note the sweet back plate and the
tasteful branding right there also it's
available in red and black and there's a
chart on the back of the box that shows
it taking a gtx 780 from 80 degrees
celsius to 45 degrees celsius under load
compared to a stock cooler pretty nice
also it's easy to install there's lots
of compatibility with AMD and NVIDIA
graphics card and as listed here you'll
note the long list of ACE tech based
coolers that it works with so it's a
great buy if you've already got one
lying around that you can use along with
the kraken g10 that's a good form NZXT
also by listing all the competing brands
there along with their own with the
kraken x40 you get a manual a single 140
millimeter black and white fan 800 to
2000 RPM and two point two millimeters
of h2o static pressure
you also get some mounting rings and
back plates an assortment of fasteners
none of which of these I'll actually be
using except for the long mounting
screws for the fan the main unit of the
X 40 is a prefilled 140 millimeter
aluminum radiator 16 inch rubber tubing
and a combo pump
slash copper base plate with pre-applied
thermal paste which connects to the CPU
or in my case the GPU inside the kraken
g10
box is the 92 millimeter fan that blows
on the memory of VRMs I also get
mounting screws and the white GPU
backplate and then you get a manual and
five zip ties the white frame that holds
everything together is also included it
interfaces with the pump block from the
x40 as you can see about a little teeth
area right there moving on here to
installation which is not terribly
difficult and it's actually explained
pretty well in the manual the main
difficulty here for you might actually
be getting the existing cooler off of
your graphics card at least that's what
gave me a little bit of trouble here's
my first run at the r9 290x so you'll
see me removing here a dozen small
screws and four of them for the GPU
bracket what you want to do in order so
you don't put too much stress my mistake
here was to also go for the six screws
on the sides of the shroud it gets the
plastic shroud off which can be useful
for cleaning the r9 290x but it does not
help lets removing the rest of the
cooler next up I also removed the rear
bracket which was also unnecessary haha
but there are two screws on the rear
bracket that I actually did need to
remove so getting those off was
important next up some extremely careful
prying right around the edges to loosen
that cooler with thermal paste on the
inside next I went ahead and unplug the
fan and I put the thermal pads from the
memory and VRMs back on the stock cooler
so I can use them again if I put it back
on next up I'm going to give the GPU a
good cleaning with some alcohol and some
swabs here you can also use coffee
filters and then on to assembling the
freaking g10 so first I'm going to screw
in the fan make sure it will be blowing
air towards the graphics card then I'm
going to attach the four long screws to
the correct holes in the back plate for
your graphics card they're labeled a B
and C and you can check that in the
manual and then go ahead and tighten
those down with the included nuts feed
the screws from that assembly through
the back of your GPUs mounting bracket
holes and then finally you get to the
somewhat delicate task of lining up the
teeth on the g10 with the pomp / block
from the x40 lowering that down onto the
four screws protruding from the graphics
card all while trying not to smear the
thermal paste and then finally screwing
down the four nuts that hold it in place
in a rotational fashion so as not to put
too much pressure on one corner of the
GPU underneath
gray it is now finished excellent now I
get to do it all over again because I
have a second one of these this time
with confidence and also without
removing Parts I don't need to hopefully
you
you
so they had guys the offending coolers
have been removed I've installed the
creek and cooling hardware and from what
I have read thus far these GPUs are
going to really be opened up now that I
have this cooling solution in place and
one other thing I might still do before
I move on to video number two is install
some vrm heat sinks on these because
this is the one thing I've read about so
far is that the other elements besides
of the GPU even though the GPU gets
cooled really well with the g10 the
power delivery elements can actually get
really hot so I might drop some a little
heat sinks onto those if I can scrounge
some up but we'll see how that goes
other than that I'm going to get these
installed set up in crossfire start
running some benchmarks also going to
head up the titan blacks and I think I'm
going to throw some 780ti is in there as
well just to kind of give a slightly
more reasonable price to performance
comparison there because the Titan
blacks are obviously very expensive but
thank you guys so much for watching this
video don't forget to subscribe to my
channel hits like button leave me a
comment and some feedback we'll see you
all next time hopefully very soon</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
