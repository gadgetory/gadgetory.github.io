when AMD's rivin launches this video is
speculative I'm going to be discussing
that very question it's one that I'm
sure many of you have asked as well I'm
going to talk about what we know so far
what we're expecting soon with a fair
degree of certainty and what I think the
perfect launch would be for consumers as
well as AMD when it comes to their rides
and CPUs and their pricing first let's
go over the facts on the Intel applied
they just launched kb lake at the
beginning of january and they've
continued their somewhat boring and
predictable trend in their mainstream
cpu line it the processes are still
limited to four cores and eight threads
max overclocking is still limited to
just a few unlocked case Q CPUs that
tend to feel overpriced and going beyond
for physical cores with Intel means you
have to upgrade to their enthusiast
platform where you'll usually find more
expensive x99 motherboards and much more
expensive drug well II CPUs I'm am
decide they have had a lot to talk about
lately their new Zen CPU architecture
will be integrated into ally of CPUs
called risin with one shift codenamed
summit ridge that has been detailed more
specifically and showing off in a few
demos the summit ridge cpu has eight
physical cores and sixteen threads via
simultaneous multi-threading which is
akin to Intel hyper threading it has 24
pci express gen 3 lanes and andy has
confirmed that all rise in class cpus
will have a base clock of at least 3
point 4 gigahertz with some leaked demo
showing chip running at 3.9 gigahertz
turbo game DS demos have been telling us
repeatedly that the instructions per
clock performance that they're seeing is
in line with intel's broadwell ecp use
which is very nice if true verizon cpus
will launch in the first quarter of 2017
and it will most likely be other cpu
versions in the family as well probably
with fewer physical cores and possibly
also with multi-threading turned off so
before we move on let me remind you that
the last time AMD was beating intel with
a faster cpu was about 11 to 12 years
ago with andy's original FX series in
2005-2006 the last time they see teams
were competitive with intel on an
instructions per clock level was about
six years ago before sandy bridge
launched beyond that they've stayed in
the game with aggressive pricing and
summon
vations on the APU side but the industry
is beyond ready for them to kick intel
on the pants with some real refreshed
competition now for the speculation part
of this video I'm going to assume a few
things based on promises that have been
made and launch date ranges that have
been set we can't assume for example
that Intel is just waiting for AMD to
launch horizon until they make a move
with pricing because Intel's pricing
simply has not changed on this chart
I've laid out sort of a recent history
of Intel CPUs going back to about twenty
eleven these are the mainstream CPUs and
then I have launched pricing here also
listed this information is all taken
from CPU worldcom and i'm using the OEM
pricing unlocked quad cores you might
notice costs between 200 and 250 dollars
depending on which one that you were
getting of course and the price has
increased a little bit if you go back to
Sandy Bridge it costs about 300 to 350
dollars for the unlocked quad core with
hyper-threading and again the price has
gone up since 2011 pricing increased
from Sandy Bridge to Ivy Bridge but
increased even more if you look at Ivy
Bridge to as well and it's kind of
leveled off since then you also might
notice though that their overall
production cycle has slowed down this
came out in January 2011 the original
Sandy Bridge chips and they were
supposed to basically keep up with a
yearly launched on the mainstream side
this was based on their old tic-tock
production cycle has a refresh was the
first extra CPU line that was added
right here in June 2014 that was neither
a tick Nora talk and intel has now
formalized process architecture
optimization as their cycles instead of
tick-tock and there's more on that in my
first five things you need to know about
cable ache video I'll put a card right
up there in the corner if you guys want
to check that out kb lake is now also an
optimization cycle rather than a tick or
a talk and it definitely shows in the
complete lack of instructions for clocks
performance improvements compared to Sky
lake as seen in my QB lake benchmarks
video and i'll post paid cards to link
that up in the corner as well all this
is to say that it's obvious that intel
has both slowed down their development
cycle and raised their prices in the
last six years if kick talk had kept up
the yearly pace after sandy bridge
launched back in 2011 well we would have
seemed canon lake launched in January
2016 a full year ago
goodness canon lake launched again
anyway here's my shirt that I had a lot
of fun with I am basically speculating
on what versions of rise in AMD might
launch and what their core counts and
thread count might be now Vera mine all
the CPUs I'm listing here is TBD I'm
making up I have no reason to believe
any of these actually exists I have no
confirmed information the only thing we
have really confirmed to summit ridge
and the stuff I discussed at the
beginning of the video that AMD has said
yes this will happen we are told of
course at the CPU is a lot of 24 pcie
lanes and that the all shiva 3.4
gigahertz clock speed at minimum with
automatic dover clocking based on your
cooling setup as well so i assume that
the core count and thread counts will be
the main major differentiating factors
in pricing and performance between rise
and cpus i'm also assuming that rise in
per clock performance will be equal to
broad well II and a bit slower than
cable inc so I've Intel's QB lake unlock
CPUs listed including the dual-core 73
50k right over here as well as a couple
of their broadwell ease to be used from
the enthusiast platform so starting from
the bottom we have a fork or four thread
rise in cpu for just one hundred and
twenty-five dollars this might be
wishful thinking but just look how
terrible it would make the 73 50k look
actually four fours rather than two with
hyper-threading and a perfectly
attainable budget chip in the low 100
dollar range I would happily recommend
entry-level builds based on something
like this next is the multi-threaded
version of the quad-core 175 dollars
walking all over the 73 50k and probably
smacking the 7600 k around to which
would be in the tier above it at least
in multi-threaded workloads and games it
would also be sitting down here at the
hundred and seventy five dollar price
point looking up there if the 7700 k
waving hi to be in like a why is it need
to cost so much money for having four
cores and eighth ribs at 225 dollars we
have a 6-core sixth Red reisen ship
which would hopefully still outperform
the 448 thread version that's fifty
dollars cheaper while also meeting the
7600 k and again pointing at the six
core Intel 6800 k that's up here at four
hundred and thirty four dollars and
wondering why it costs so much money
like twice as much
and why the 6800 k just has such
expensive teats a 6 quart well thread
rise in CP you should then be able to
take out the 7700 k at least with apps
that use all those threads and also set
the entropy for higher-end workstations
about a hundred bucks cheaper than what
the Intel enthusiast platform currently
costs which is what you have to buy into
if you want six quarts finally for the
full summit ridge experience I have an
eight-core 16 thread ship at five
hundred dollars and then another one at
six hundred and fifty dollars and I
assumed they maybe do some bidding for
the more expensive part to guarantee
higher clock speeds or something like
that now 500 plus dollars is a lot for a
cpu I mean I'm not not kidding around
here but remembers that these cpus
should be able to compete with Intel's
thousand-dollar Broadwell eight
processors and AMD does need to have
some flagship level products to
re-establish themselves with a high-end
manufacturer and to earn some money
again if they want to keep up with Intel
in the coming years and finally here is
my survival shirts which is based on the
wishful thinking of these chart i just
showed you and potential AMD launches
and pricing what I think the reduction
in price and Intel CPUs would be across
the board and basically you look at
about fifty to a hundred dollars 100 ish
dollars for the high-end ones and more
like a fifty dollar reduction down at
the lower end like the 73 50k Austin 130
bucks which seems like what it should
cost not a hundred and eighty bucks
wouldn't that be nice now I think insult
would still be touting their IPC lead
over rising because that does seem like
it will be the case when it launches at
least was something like kb lake cpus
for example they would still priced them
maybe just a little bit higher than the
AMD chips but I'm also not sure where
this would leave until eight core 6900 k
or ten core 6950 X which cost eleven
hundred and seventeen hundred dollars
respectively but I have to imagine those
prices would drop as well but it would
be nice to be able to get for example 73
50k 430 7600 k for actually two hundred
bucks 7700 k for 275 that'd be a nice
discount i 760 800k around 375 and 68
50k around 525 and i can't imagine the
eight core and 10 core processors
costing too much more it would be at
least nice to see the 16
DX come down to actually a thousand
dollars rather than 1,700 now again guys
this is primarily speculation apart from
the facts listed towards the beginning
of this video so none of this might
actually happen Andy might price their
parts way higher and nothing might
change price-wise on the Intel side or
we might find out that we've been
totally duped by the early leaks and
demos and the verizon performance just
isn't there and it's not competitive I
find that to be unlikely we might even
see rising ships be less expensive than
what I'm speculating here there have
been rumors to that effect that like the
summit ridge might cost less or the same
price is what a 7700 k currently costs
but I found that to be less likely
because it would really gut the pcu mark
as a cpu market and you know the
companies do have to make some profit I
think what I've shown here is pretty
feasible though and it is a big reason
why i've been recommending that people
wait for now if you're about to build a
new system at least until febuary and
march roll around and if you're really
patient Intel's enthusiast platform is
usually refreshed every three years and
x99 has launched in 2014 2014 2015 2016
2017 so if reisen does hit hard out of
the gates there is an answer from intel
possibly on the horizon when x 2 99
launches probably later this year that's
all for this video though guys thank you
so much for watching and let me know
it's speculative videos like this one
are useful for you at all of course hit
