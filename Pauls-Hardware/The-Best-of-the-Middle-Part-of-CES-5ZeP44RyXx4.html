this video's description
I'm over TV GA now guys sorry it's
pretty loud in here let's start off with
something a VGA has never made before a
keyboard that's right this is the z10 it
features cherry MX red switches I get a
removable soft touch wrist rest it's a
bit of rubber on it here and you have a
LCD display on the board that will tie
in with precision X and it will display
specific information on that little
screen about your overclock in
temperatures and useless stuff so a
pretty cool new mechanical keyboard from
EVGA it should be coming out I believe
in q2 next up here we have the geforce
gtx 980 a hydro copper so basically you
have a 980 over here this is using the
reference PCB and they've put this hydro
copper unit on top if you buy this
standalone basically you get 120
millimeter radiator like this I get some
a bit of braiding I'm the tubing here
which is kind of nice and it EDG a block
this is made by a stick with copper on
the bottom as you can see so you can buy
that by itself and then mod your own gtx
980 or you can buy the card all by
itself so this shroud actually pops off
like this and then underneath you have
pretty much the same stuff that you
would get with a standard gtx 980 which
means that you can easily add this onto
an idea that you might already have but
an easy way to get some simple water
cooling go on your card and Jacob told
me these cards under load are running at
about 40 low 40s and degrees Celsius
under full load so very very effective
means of cooling your GPU next up is
something you guys will probably be
excited about but it is a bit on the
higher end this is the GTX 980
classified edition and this is the
kingpin version which means it's been
designed or designed in collaboration
with kingpin specifically for
overclocking as a result they've assumed
that people are going to be removing
this included cooler which is a very
effective cool with a hundred millimeter
fans duel fans there they've also
included a low profile bracket if you
want to add a water cooler to it and
make it a single slot card the GPU is
going to ship overclocked that this is
made for overclocking i asked jacob how
this would perform on air and he said it
could probably easily hit 1500 to 1550
at least
if not more than that depending on the
GPU get you get of course but he said
the kingpin said you could probably with
water cooling on this and maybe even
some bios weeks that he's expecting to
hit 2120 200 megahertz on the GPU which
is absolutely fantastic obviously this
is still in production this is just a
demo unit they have here you can see
they've also beefed up the power
delivery and they've also included some
RGB LED so you have three separate ones
one down at the bottom one up on EVGA
logo and then also some RGB LEDs on the
back so even if you remove the shroud
and you lose a couple of those RGB LEDs
you'll still be able to program these up
at the top and all three of them can be
programmed individually so if you want a
light show going on you can you can make
things pretty dotty if you want to oh
and one other special thing this card
can do since the memory doesn't always
like to run as low temperatures when
you're doing exotic cooling like liquid
nitrogen the memory on this card
actually has built-in heaters to keep it
at a higher temperature than the rest of
the card if you're doing exotic cooling
another just one of those random
features that probably only really
benefits overclockers but it's going to
mean that this card is probably going to
be among the best when it comes to high
level gtx 980 ocing for a woman's need
hey guys i'm over at they be quiet sweet
and i've actually never ever covered any
be quiet products so i'm going to give
you a really quick look at some of them
right now they have cases they've really
had quality power supplies as well that
are really well made and very well
reviewed and they also have a bunch of
really nice air coolers they'll have
really excellent black finishes their
super clean they do a bunch of brush
metal on them and that sort of thing
they have a couple new ones that they're
talking about here including the shadow
rock LP which is a low-profile unit so
that's going to be great for things like
HT pcs or something like a smaller form
factor build where you need adequate
cooling maybe even some overclocking but
not necessarily something as monstrous
this may be their larger size dark rock
coolers now what I want to know from you
guys is what products from be quiet
would you be interested in me covering
are you more interested in the cases
power supplies or the air coolers let me
know in the comments and I'll see if I
can get some and do some reviews on
Paul's hardware alright guys we're at my
onyx now and I
three things to show you here first as a
new my onyx sorry gasps mousepads these
are fairly thin rubber base mouse pads
but what lanix has done its first they
cut these they had a special process for
cutting these at the edges they do it
very slowly it kind of seals up the
edges to prevent fraying also it's
totally waterproof on the top to finish
it's on the top of them but it's also
washable all you have to do is use warm
water that's 90 degrees Fahrenheit or
hunter and it's also available in
incredibly large size as you can see
right here and the price range on these
is ranging from 10 bucks all the way up
to 40 bucks that's not my beer I promise
next up we have a brand new mouse from
my onyx this is the one in the center
right here so on the right we have the
mouse which is a one of my favorite my
mice it's got a bit wider base as well
as rests here for your for your ring
finger and your pinky and that's the one
that I like we also have the AVR that's
over here this is ambidextrous so you
can use it either way it's a symmetrical
Mouse also very popular but they got
kind of an in-between going on now with
the caster so basically you have kind of
in between you got a bit of grooves
there on the right side to provide some
contours for the hand not quite as wide
as the announced you still of course
have side buttons here forward and back
and my onyx is also keeping up with
their tradition of making all of the
button clicks on the mouse whether
you're talking left to right center
click here for changing your profile or
forward and back buttons they make them
all feel the same and it's really just a
subtle difference but once you actually
try it out you're like that actually
makes sense it feels right that although
clicks click the same with the same
kookiness and I can like that one so
moving on to the exciting stuff Kane has
agreed to model for me here this is my
onyx quantified gaming qg series and
this is what they have to kick started
going for which is almost almost over
but they're doing really well so if you
guys want to check that out you should
go over and see the quantified gaming
kickstarter but basically what we got
here is a little sensor on the mouse
itself and what that is going to do is
make contact with your hand and then my
onyx is going to use their software
which is all open by the way
in order to gather data so as you can
see here on the screen you can see the
actions that Kane is doing which is zero
right now because it's not clicking but
once he starts clicking we see actions
up there at the top we also see how fast
he's moving the most and that sort of
thing but probably the more important
stuff that the sensor is actually
picking up is going to be the heartbeat
and the skin response down at the bottom
so heartbeat is how intense he's feeling
right now how super excited he is about
the game he's playing and then skin
response at the bottom is just how good
of a connection he's getting between his
hand and the mouse so once they have
gathered this information about what
you're doing and how you're feeling
while you're playing the game what can
they do with it so here's the quantified
gaming an action that got borderlands up
here and you can see up on the right
side this is an overlay on the screen
you can actually take these little guys
and move them around so you notice
there's three heart rates showing right
there you can actually be monitoring the
heart rates of say your friends when
you're gaming with you can do heart rate
you can also monitor some of the other
metrics that are available there so I
imagine if you're playing say Starcraft
match and you're looking at your actions
per minute and that way you can like
talk trash on your friends because
they're not pulling their weight or
something like that that be cool but
another moment of challenges that my
alex has been dealing with here is
actually setting these up to make
contact with the hand when you put your
palm on it so we have a few different
examples here of where they have
switched the sensor around and you can
see the sensor when the hand makes
contact with it will light up and
they're working with these to make sure
that depending on your grip style and
depending on the type of mouse that you
actually go for you will be able to
actually make contacts with the sensor
points so it can read all of your
information now practically speaking
these are obviously going to be used for
gaming right off the bat but there's a
lot of applications for this we were
discussing the possibility of say a call
center where you have calls coming in
and a bunch of people out on the floor
and a supervisor can be monitoring the
heart rate of everyone who's taking
calls and step in if somebody is getting
too upset it can actually be a great
boon to customer service all over the
place but that's just one example that's
what my alex is really looking for right
now they're building this technology but
they're looking for other examples of
ways to use it because they know that
what they've thought of so far is
awesome but once this gets out there
there's going to be a ton more
people are gonna come up with a bunch of
excellent ideas for how to use this
technology alright guys i'm over here at
asu's I'm an ROG booth we're at Trump
Tower and Asus always has a ton of stuff
so I'm gonna try to run down a lot of it
not much going on new from the
motherboard or video card side however
they have introduced some SLI bridges
which are pretty cool they're light up
they have RG logos on them and they plug
in and they will give your system and I
school look especially if you're rockin
ROG hardware super sweet alright moving
down the line of course we have the RG
Swift monitors actually guys I had to
come back to this one because this is a
new ROG Swift monitor this is the PG 278
Q and this is 4k it's a 4k IPS panel 60
Hertz and it has g-sync enabled so
basically all the goodness that you guys
saw with the original 1440 rog Swift
monitor but now in 4k not quite as high
as i refresh straight but i think the
inclusion of g-sync will really help
offset that moving further down we have
we have all the texts make you guys I'm
just watching me just watching me at
logans Logan's still over my shoulder as
he always it's okay strix those tricks
have some new stuff going on right now
so here is a new mechanical keyboard
from Strix full keyboard we got 104 keys
plus some extra stuff we got some macro
keys down in this side this one is using
cherry MX brown switches which is my
personal favorite also going to be
available with blues and then they're
considering other switches to depending
on customer feedback and demand yes
beautiful and of course you can pop off
the key caps and everything moving on
though some more strict peripherals so
this is a strict 7.1 headsets not
simulated 7.1 mind you there are
individual drivers in there so it's true
7.1 memory foam up there and the
headrest nice big pads in there so check
out the strict 7.1 headset if you're
looking for something new it also lights
up on the side continuing the kind of
owl logo thats tricks is known for you
also get a breakout box right there so
you can control it and all that good
stuff the Strix claw mouse has been out
for a little bit but it is still
available if you guys are interested
500,000 DPI optical sensor on this one
day Zeus has got a lot of good feedback
about this one entering into the
peripherals market this is also the boom
mic for that 7.1 surround headset over
here is the G
20 AJ basically this is a desktop system
it's pre-built it's got really really
nice Hardware in there i 747 90 and a
gtx 980 built-in so if you're looking
for a desktop system and you're not
really wanting to build one yourself
this one's really well-made it's got
cool design on the top it's got some
LEDs going on on the front very
aggressive design very small footprint
on the desktop as well and very quiet
ladies and gentlemen this is probably
one of the more exciting things that
asus has on offer so this is a something
they're working on this is not available
yet but if you guys are familiar with
the DisplayPort standard called adaptive
vsync it's known by some other names in
the industry but we're not supposed to
use those now but I will be free to
synchronize my footage with the audio
that I'm recording I'm just saying that
right now because that time for printing
stuff ok basically what we have here is
a 120 Hertz IPS panel yes 120 volts and
IPS 2560 x 1440 which i think is a great
option because it's not quite 4k but
it's gonna be a lot easier to push with
graphics cards 5 millisecond response
time which is excellent for IPS and you
got OSD navigation and all that good
stuff but what this is going to do is
synchronize the frame rate between the
monitor and the graphics card in this
case an AMD graphics card and it's going
to give you nice smooth frame rates the
benefits are unfathomable and we're
really excited about this technology we
should be seeing these monitors in 2015
and lastly I could not leave without
going over these custom builds the
nations commission specifically for
their saber-tooth Z 97 mark s the All
Whites special edition limited run
another board it's a really nice tough
series in 97 board this is a humvee
design by ace Finland which is clearly
meant to show the durability and
toughness of the asus tough series
boards and of course all white because
the sub ronco formerly known as a sub
ronco now the market
s is also all white we also have a
project snowblind over here this was by
darth vedas who is an excellent
excellent case modder also with primo
chill just a really unique build the way
they've got everything set up vertically
here really really nice looking and i
love the white liquid with clear tubing
but they've done here as well with two
big ol reservoirs in the back very
unique builds in a great way to showcase
not just the z97 mark s but also the
asus video cards that are in there too
