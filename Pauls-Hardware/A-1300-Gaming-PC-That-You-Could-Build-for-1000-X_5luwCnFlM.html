hardware this is my monthly build video
for November 2018 I have a system here
I'm gonna put it all together today at
the beginning of this month just a few
days ago actually I did parts lists and
I did a $750 builds and then I did more
like a 1414 hundred and fifty H dollar
build this build is kind of right in
between if you take all the parts here
it's about twelve hundred and fifty
dollars but I want to point out I've
made some specific accommodations for
the case I'm using today this is the new
cooler master SL 600 M which I've wanted
to build in since I first saw it back at
Computex but this is a high-end case
it's a two hundred dollar case and I've
also paired it up with a 240 millimeter
all-in-one liquid cooler which costs
about one hundred and twenty dollars so
three hundred twenty dollars for the
case and the CPU cooler is a little on
the high side and you can easily shave
off one hundred eight hundred and fifty
even close to two hundred dollars by
going with a less expensive case and
maybe an air cooler but that said
everything here is about twelve fifty
you maybe could come in and around
eleven hundred dollars again if you make
some different choices there but I will
be talking a bit about building in this
case today and of course I'll be talking
about this entire system altogether and
we'll be testing the system and a follow
up video and comparing this system with
the three thousand dollar plus system
that I built last month and we'll see
kind of the gaming experience between
both do you get that much more paying
that much more for the high end Intel
system with the ninety nine hundred K
and an RT X 20 80 TI or could you get
yourself pretty much the same experience
by going with an AMD setup so I'm gonna
be using the 2600 or actually the 2600 X
is a cpu I'm installing down there and
then for the graphics card we have a
Radeon Vega 56 four hundred dollar
version of that card more on that in
just a second though the motherboard
I've chosen is the MSI B 450 tomahawk
and this one has been reviewed by quite
a few people and it's got good power
delivery for overclocking it's also got
a very nice feature set and it's only
about $100 I did in the initial builds
video at the beginning of the month to
talk about using a different motherboard
at the asrock x4 70 tight sheet which I
would recommend potentially upgrading to
if you're gonna pair it with this case
because that will allow you to connect
the front panel USB see USB 3.1 gen2
type-c connector on that because this
motherboard does not have that header
other than that everything else is
perfectly functional the liquid cooler
is in master liquid ml 240 RGB is cool
performs quite well and it's got some
fancy addressable RGB lighting on the
fans as well as the cooler itself but if
you want to get by with something a
little bit less expensive this was the
original piece I was planning on using
which is the hyper 212 black edition I
will still integrate this into a system
in the future because I wanted to give
it a shot but it's only $35 so 35 bucks
for this versus 120 bucks for that save
yourself a little bit of money and go
with air cooling if you're trying to get
in at a lower price I did go with the
higher end power supply for this build
the EVGA 650 GQ here which is a few more
bucks it's 80 plus gold rated though and
it's a modular power supply but around
$60 you should be able to find yourself
a 550 watt or 650 watt 80 plus gold
rated power supply with all black cables
I like that one now for the graphics
card I actually had to make a terrible
choice or maybe you will have to make a
terrible choice because I was able to
make my choice when I was still able to
get an aftermarket card for 400 bucks
right now what I have linked in the
description is for four hundred five
dollars assuming the price is held a
blower style version of the Vega 56 and
section asrock variant there this is
just the standard reference design Vega
56 but what I'm using today is the card
that I bought for $400 from Amazon just
like two days ago which is a red dragon
version of the Vega 56 which has
aftermarket cooler triple fan design
which I'm pretty confident will do a
better job than the blower style design
so if you can find yourself a bargain on
a Vega 56 like this one then definitely
jump on it hopefully more of those will
come out between now and Black Friday
and just around things off have a 240
gig SSD for a main operating system
drive and then I have g.skill ripjaws 5
ddr4 memory here which is the kit that I
recommended in the video's description
because the 3200 speed kit is a nice
fast kits that is good to parrots Rison
the reptiles 5 kits from g.skill do work
with Rison from all accounts and from my
testing as well but these are for gig
Stix and I did want a 16 gig kit so I'm
actually gonna be swapping in this
flower X kit from g.skill which is a
more expensive kit because it's very
very compatible with resin I'm just
using it because it is a 2 by 8 gig kit
it's rated 3200 speed castling Z's 14 so
I will change the timings on this to
match the Ripjaws 5 kit that I
originally recommended so those are the
parts I'm working with today and it is
time to assemble this computer
so the SL 600m definitely makes an
impression when you first get out of the
box it's got aluminum construction on
the Front's on the top here and it's got
a unique design it's got two 200
millimeter intake fans at the bottom
with what they're calling a chimney
designs so the vertical airflow pushes
air northwards
and then exhausts mainly at the top so
you might actually notice pretty quickly
for example there's no 120 millimeter
exhaust right here where you would
expect one to be instead on the other
side of that they've actually put a
reservoir mount so it's sort of a unique
use of that space if you're not going to
use this for an exhaust there are a few
things unfortunately that I was
immediately not impressed with upon
taking it out of the box one is this
that's not exactly a stable sitting
stance that it has going on there I
believe what's causing that is this back
support which is a piece of metal that's
kind of got some wobbles going on and
I'm guessing this got bent or something
maybe during shipping
this unit does appear to have been
previously unboxed maybe it was a sample
that they checked out before they sent
it over to me but it might be a
challenging to get that to bend back in
place so that's a little bit
disappointing
other than that though the side panel
here has coolers masters method that
they've been using for a while where you
sort of loosen the thumb screws pull its
halfway off and then it can sort of sit
like that and when I first did this and
opened it up it was making a noise it
was making Joe cringe which is kind of
the noise of like adhesive on glass or
metal being slowly peeled away and I
believe that's actually from this bottom
piece here feeling it here it's pretty
sturdy this is a tempered glass piece
and it's got some metal reinforcement
along the sides it just seemed like this
was possibly peeling away a little bit
slightly it's not bad enough that I
think it's a concern for me right now
but it would be if I was going to be
using the system long term I feel
slightly concerned about that adhesive
failing actually Leon Lee case I've been
using recently had that piece fail on
the front of it so it's made me slightly
suspicious of cases that have tempered
glass that is held on by a metal piece
that's held to the tempered glass by
just a piece of adhesive and then the
only other thing I wanted to mention
here just as far as first impressions go
is where this
panel sort of hooks onto that base piece
there just upon or moving it I was
noticing a pretty good amount of wear
already along this edge and from where
that hooks in again that would be
covered when the side panels on and
everything I'm just trying to give you
guys my honest first impressions as I
take this this little case apart for the
first time and prepared to build in it
I'm actually discovering these little
mounts are actually multi-purpose mounts
so they have SSD mounts harddrive mounts
2.5 inch or 3.5 inch drive mats and then
they've got a bunch of other holes
spaced out there so I imagine you can
mount a reservoir or a pump to one of
these as well one here is mounted at the
back of this which is actually the power
supply shroud a one back here at the
back that I already showed you and
there's actually two on the front as
well at the very top is a pretty easily
removable piece and this is just a cover
so probably gonna block some noise at
the top underneath is just mesh so if
you want more airflow you can remove
that or if you want things to be a
little quieter or just to complete the
look
pop it right back on you can remove this
front piece here which again is just
pretty much a solid piece but we don't
care because this isn't where the intake
is happening the intake is happening at
the bottom of the case again here you
can see two more of those mounts that
are mounted there and there can also get
a look at where the power supply is
going to Matt right in there and for the
power supply there is a extension cord
it's tied in there that feeds back to
the back of the case so you can plug the
power supply and where you normally
would there's also an included fan hub
that's already plugged in got a couple
2.5 inch drive cages there as well and
here on the bottom you can get a look at
those two 200 millimeter fans that are
configured to use this as an intake so
big old dust filters right underneath
there this has a sort of unique design
for a dust filter you can pull it out
from the back of the case entirely but
it's also attached here it's like a
hinge and another handle so but which
made me think you could they made it so
you could pull it out from the front to
which which I appreciate that would be
kind of a nice feature to be able to do
it's a friend actually has these catches
here so you can't do that but anyway
unique unique adjustable filter for your
intake fans say at the bottom
so as little baffled about how to get at
the power supply mounts here because it
is kind of tucked away in there so this
piece is held on by two squeeze screws
at the top and two at the bottom remove
those and then you can remove that this
also has two more mounting points for a
2.5 inch drives by the way you just put
the plugs on them and then stick them on
there and then behind here we actually
have an outer shroud here as well as an
inner ear piece that the power supply
mounts to and this is made so that you
can remove this to support longer length
power supply since the power supply
length if it's longer or shorter is
gonna be longer that way since the top
of the power supply is gonna be going up
right there so I got four thumb screws
at the front right here that you need to
loosen and then this piece pops off and
it's just held on by a couple plugs at
the back there and this is that single
this is that same similar rail system
that Coolermaster has used in the past
so again you can mount that there you
could shift it down if you needed to
those lower two screws or what's holding
this outer shell on whereas the upper
two screws from forth is what was
holding this piece on and that's why I
just fell when I removed it so next
we'll mount the power supply to that and
then this will mount back into the case
there
I decided to mount the SSD to the back
here
interesting the coolermaster did not
provide a little fine thread the m3
threading screws no standard ones just a
little plug ones that are made to mount
on that front SSD mount I'm still using
it back here you still can it's just
slightly awkward in that once this is
actually mounted you know have four
little posts sticking out there but it's
it shouldn't stick out far enough that
it actually conflicts with the side
panel so we can proceed so guys I'm just
working on the cable management back
here I have added the little RGB
controller so I can have some RGB lights
on the cooler master master liquid ML
240 R however I noticed a potential
incompatibility issue that I wanted to
point out I'm mainly giving Coolermaster
a hard time about this because there are
two cooler master products cooler master
all in one liquid cooler at the top
which would be a very good place to
position it these are the two fan plugs
the two headers for that you'll note
that at the maximum length here they are
about an inch short of actually reaching
down here to the fan splitter the fan
splitter has mounts on the case itself
with standoffs so it's not really
something you could reasonably move
around you probably want to keep it
there so just pointing that out and my
solution here is just going to be a
little fan splitter which will also act
as a little bit of an extension and give
us just enough length to plug both of
these in hey oh yeah look like it's like
things you might need when you're
building a PC more people should watch
that video
so everything is pretty much installed
now our red dragon Vega 56 just barely
had enough clearance there at the end
and I was trying to plug it in it's got
an awkward plug position here because
the PCB on this card actually only comes
out to here this entire area right here
here is just a fin stack which actually
has air flow air pass through flow which
actually I think will be very good for
this case because the air coming up here
can just go right through that radiator
to provide some extra cooling for the
GPU and then it get up there to provide
some ventilation for the liquid cooler
of course butt plugs on this are right
in the middle it's just kind of awkward
that this little cable here I was
actually saying earlier as I was
building that this little space right
here to pass like front panel connectors
and USB and stuff is actually pretty
nice and in a good position and then Joe
realize just now it's actually held on
by a couple screws I'm now discovering
that this piece is actually the entire
cover for the bottom enclosure area that
has the two fans on it which does have
also amounts for radiators and stuff if
you want to read reconfigure for water
cooling or something in that range but
removing those screws is giving me a
little bit more clearance here so maybe
I can pass these PCI Express power
cables through
okay's my bills has been assembled in
the SL 600 M everything is installed and
plugged in as far as I can tell I need
to another front panel
that's correct Jo minor issue all right
let's try that again with the front
panel on now but what I was about to say
is let me switch the power supply out in
the back but I can't because the power
supplies on extension so protip
switch your power supply on first before
you try to do your test boot and maybe
do that with the side panel off so you
can reach the switch on the power supply
ah there we go
so we have learned construction of a
computer in this case I think it is a
unique layout and a unique design and as
already mentioned some reviews have
already come out on this when it comes
to the performance and if your graphics
card is running hot this does a really
good job obviously just taking all that
air and feeding it directly up that is
also why it has such a high stance off
the ground so there's plenty of space
here underneath and if you're gonna have
airflow like that you definitely need to
have a removable dust filter and I guess
one that folds to because that's very
convenient but as usual this has just
been a build video and I will be
following up later on testing the system
for some performance and ideally
plugging it into a 2560 by 1440 freesync
monitor so we can test adaptive refresh
rates gameplay on this configuration and
give a bit of a comparison to the much
more expensive system that I set up last
month but guys thank you so much for
watching this video definitely hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it and
links to the parts they use are down in
the video's description below including
this new case from Coolermaster thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
