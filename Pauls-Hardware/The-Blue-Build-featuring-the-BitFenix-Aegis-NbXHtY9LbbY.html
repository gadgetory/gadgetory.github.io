departure for me it was pretty much a
wholly different aesthetic than I
usually go for but I'm actually really
happy with the results the working title
of this build is the blue build or
perhaps the BitFenix blue build but let
me know if you can think of something
more clever and post it in the comment
section down below and if you think this
thing looks badass go ahead and hit that
like button too while you're at it but
this is the BitFenix Aegis it is also
the $1,200 build from my may builds
video and if you caught that one as
promised I have assembled it here for
your viewing pleasure also big big shout
outs on this video to Kingston HyperX
for their support in the memory and the
SSD in this build MSI for the
motherboard and an J of course of J's
two cents fame for letting me last
minute viral the power supply which in
my humble opinion is a key component for
this build we're keeping things pretty
was was kind of a primary concern but
let's jump back in time a short while to
when this build was not yet assembled
and I went over all the parts again for
your viewing pleasure and now to run
down all the parts in this build we'll
start over here with the case of course
that's kind of what we started with a
very beginning and that's kind of what
everything else is faced around I want
the blue one so I wanted to stick with
the color scheme it's the BitFenix Aegis
if you guys want to see a full review of
this go ahead and check out harbor
connects because Dimitri did a fantastic
full review what I'm going to do is
build this whole system in the case and
then towards the end of the video I'm
going to take a look at the build and
kind of go over my thoughts on its
having builds in it and the pros and
cons and I'll focus on the case and that
kind of good stuff I also have the
BitFenix fury this is a 650 watt version
I used the 550 watt watt version in the
May builds video this is 100 watts more
it's the one that was available a big
shout-out to Jay for letting me borrow
this actually by the way and the bonus
is that the little highlight color strip
on the side is is also blue on the 650
watt version sticks with the color
scheme although there's a power supply
cover in the case it doesn't really
matter anyway for my memory and my SSD
huge shoutouts to hyper X actually guys
if you're interested
HyperX has a youtube channel they've
been doing tons of stuff there as far as
like competitive gaming and that sort of
thing they support lots of competitive
gamers and twitch streamers so if you
guys are interested check out the HyperX
youtube channel it's lots of fun i'll
post a link to it and you guys can check
that out and I highly recommend it but
anyway I have the HyperX fury memory kit
here this is a pretty basic 16 gig 2 by
8 gig kits 1866 that's a little bit
faster than your standard 1600 memory I
also have the savage 240 gig SSD this is
brand new from Kingston it's red so it
doesn't match the color scheme I know
but that's ok because it's fast super
fast as you can maybe tell up here 560
megabytes per second reads and 530
megabytes per second writes it's got the
new flies on controller so whether it's
using compressible or incompressible
data it's it's still fast and yeah great
job HyperX on that drive i've already
read some reviews on it and that sort of
thing but that's my memory that's my
storage on my SSD this right here is the
4690k from Intel Core i5 I should say I
guess quad core no hyper threading
extremely popular chip for for gaming
overclockable 2 we are going to be
overclocked over overclocking it because
we have this enter max cooler right here
the ETS T 40 is all black and it's got
blue LEDs on the black fan it's blue and
black it matches the color scheme it's
also a very good cooler and you can get
it for like 40 or 50 bucks so that's
cool moving along MSI z97 mg 43 is our
motherboard it's micro ATX since this is
a micro ATX case it's blue and black
does everything that you might want to
z97 motherboard to do in a micro ATX
form factor anyway we also have some
little add-ons and accessories here
going on the BitFenix sent over now one
a potential complaint about this case is
that it doesn't come with a full
complement of fans that you get a 120
millimeter fan in the back and it is a
nice BitFenix one but you don't get any
front intakes so bear that in mind if
you get this case you're going to want
to add some fans in there so BitFenix
sent me a slew of them these are all the
blue LED specter pro fans so I'm going
to be kind of picking and choosing which
one of these ones of these actually put
in
they also sent me their alchemy LED
strips these are the white ones I also
have some blue LED strips from Taiwan
that I've actually had kind of on
reserve for a while I'm going to see
which looks better the white or the blue
so I might actually end up using the
blue ones but the alchemy strips are
great and you can't necessarily get the
ones that I got in Taiwan here in the
States if you're looking for LED strips
so if you are looking for LED strips the
BitFenix alchemy ones are pretty nice
and you know what I did I completely
skipped over the graphics card this is
also a changeup from the may builds
video just in that it's still GTX 970
which I still recommend yes despite to
be 3.5 gigs of memory thing it's still a
good card for the price but I won't with
the EVGA one because that's what I have
on hand I wasn't able to get the MSI one
for this build and hey it's still blue
ones and black so it still matches and
there it is an explanation and a look at
all the parts in the box pretty here on
the table you know what I should do I
should actually build this system so why
don't we cue the music I don't I don't
music right
you
so now that the build is all put
together I'm going to give you guys my
thoughts on it but first it's time to
say thank you to this video sponsor
lynda.com the website that is dedicated
to making you smarter now you should
know this but I will tell you anyway
lynda.com is an online learning platform
with over 3000 on-demand video courses
to help you strengthen your business
technology and creative skills via this
sponsorship promotion you can get a 10
day free trial that's right you can do
this simply by visiting
lynda.com/tekzilla lynda.com but let's
be honest not everyone wants to live the
glamorous life of the YouTube video
editor so you might consider signing up
to learn something else like business
for example go learn your general
business skills your management your
productivity and a business software as
well like Excel Google Analytics
PowerPoint and QuickBooks then you can
write me up a five-year business plan
that will make me insanely wealthy I
will let you know if it works and then
you can do one for yourself as well now
if you're going to have that proposal on
my desk by tomorrow morning though
you're going to want to click the
sponsor link in this video's description
or you can go directly to lynda.com
slash fall back to the blue-billed
though as I kind of alluded to at the
beginning I really like how this build
turned out I usually shy away from
bright colors and blingy stuff like LED
fans but with some of the considerations
made here I think it actually works and
it's not even all that gaudy first it's
pretty much two-toned with blue and
black being the primary colors the
BitFenix fury psu with the fully sleeved
cables keeps everything very clean and
it doesn't distract with other colors in
the cabling I also really like the shade
of blue that BitFenix went with this
version of the aegis by the way it's
also available in red yellow white and
black and this is the first time I've
said that I actually like the look of
the opposite side panel when you're
looking through there the paint job is
great on both sides so with the large
window to look through it really helps
cut the components kind of stand out
against the blue of the other side panel
it looks kinda like candy to me actually
for some reason you guys kind of see
that too a very nice feature of the
aegis is that you can pretty much pull
out all the cage
and everything from the inside and get
it completely empty I could remove this
top one too but I'm actually going to
use it anyway let's talk negatives for a
few moments and if I didn't already
mention to you guys Dmitry did a full
review of the red version of the Aegis
over at hardware connects so I encourage
you to check out that video if you're
considering purchasing this case he did
a really good job as Dmitry mentioned
there's some concerns with the plastic
parts of this case the glossy finish at
the top and the front as well as the
side window glossy finish aside that's
an aesthetic choice some like it some
dote these can scratch easily so maybe
do what I did and leave the protective
plastic sheets on as long as you can
while building to prevent scratches or
that sort of thing also if you're wiping
it use a very very fine cloth like one
that's made for like cleaning camera
lenses for example also while there are
dust filters on the front the bottom and
the top they're just not implemented
quite that well the bottom and front
filters in particular seem to fit on
kind of loosely and just held on by
magnets and they fall off a little bit
more easily than I would like it's not a
deal breaker but it's something that I
would hope BitFenix addresses in future
revisions I also notice that the what
the cages removed inside which I did
pretty quickly there's some considerable
flex with the motherboard tray which I
didn't like as much but on the plus side
I was very happy to be able to easily
remove all of those cages so that's a
trade off that I'm willing to accept so
there it is guys my $1200 Intel 4690k
blue build in the BitFenix Aegis micro
ATX case with the BitFenix fury fully
sleeved power supply the MSI z97 mg 43
motherboard EVGA GTX 970 SC video card
the enter max ET St 40 CPU cooler which
blended in perfectly by the way and then
from HyperX the fury ddr3 memory kit and
the HyperX savage 240 gig SSD I also
added a couple BitFenix Spectre pro blue
LED 140 millimeter fans at the front for
intake and 120 at the back again bear in
mind the case only ships with one 120 so
you might want to add additional fans if
you're buying this I decided not to add
any more LEDs than the ones that were
already there from the fans it just
didn't really see
necessary and again I don't like going
over the top with LEDs it can get gaudy
pretty quickly but if you enjoyed this
video go ahead and hit that like button
let me know what you think of my build
in the comments section down below cuz
I'm really curious to find out if this
look like the kind of brightly colored
thing actually appeals to you guys or at
least a subset of you guys to some
degree also check out the description
for links to my t-shirt store you can
buy a t-shirt like this one you can also
use my Amazon affiliate code before you
checkout at Amazon that helps me out a
ton and you will of course also find
links to the case itself and the full PC
park picker parts list and as always
thank you for watching
