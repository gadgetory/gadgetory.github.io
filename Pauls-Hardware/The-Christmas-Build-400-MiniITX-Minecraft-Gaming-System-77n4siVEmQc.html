hello everyone welcome to Paul's
hardware this is my Christmas Eve video
because it is Christmas Eve I'm doing a
build today gonna be assembling the
parts that you see right here in front
of me but first up since it is Christmas
Eve I wanted to start by saying Merry
Christmas to all you guys out there hope
you're having a wonderful holiday season
whether you celebrate or whether you
don't celebrate just best wishes to all
of you out there I've had a fantastic
year producing videos for you here on
Paul's hardware and I plan to continue
that in 2016 so happy new year all that
good stuff but let's move on to the
actual build that I'm putting together
which is actually going to be a
Christmas present tomorrow morning for
my little nephew he's about eight years
old and the request was that he get a
computer first that he could upgrade
maybe a little bit in the future at a
year or two when he sort of moves into
that phase in his life starts learning
to tinker with and play with things like
I think a lot of us probably did at that
age but second that needs to be able to
play Minecraft so this is my Minecraft
plus system it's using an AMD APU a 78
50 K at the heart of it and I think it's
going to be a great starter system so
first just kind of get off the ground or
hit the ground running with being able
to play some games in Minecraft of
course but also to provide an upgrade
path since there's no graphics card you
could possibly add a graphics card in
the future possibly do some memory
upgrading that's easy enough to do maybe
even add some more storage in the future
since we have a 240 gig a data SSD but
not necessarily a mechanical hard drive
for mass storage but I wanted it to be
fast so with SSD right out of the gate
this is also the build that I did or
sort of preassembled in my December
builds video so just circling back
around like I promised you guys and
actually putting it together they might
notice some of this build is actually
already pre-built I worked on this
yesterday and I actually got windows
loaded and up to date so that's good
because if we want to use this tomorrow
while all the guests are over here and
we have lots of kids running around and
screaming and we want to say hey look
go play Minecraft for a while and let
the adults do adult things we can do
that so I'm happy to say that everything
does work already so it was kind of a
outside-the-box build to make sure
everything was functional now I'm going
to go ahead and drop this all into the
system our case of course is the fractal
four or five hundred let me run down the
rest of these components real quick and
then we'll proceed with the build so
apart from the 78 50 K that's
pre-installed onto the motherboard down
there I wanted to go with a better than
average CPU cooler so rather than using
the stock cooler that comes with it I
went with the hyper T 2 from cooler
master this was actually available with
a rebate so it came in at about eleven
or twelve dollars and for anyone who's
using a stock CPU heatsink fan this is a
very inexpensive upgrade and although
it's not the best CPU cooler out there
it seems to be doing a great job for me
so far stays pretty quiet it's got a
sleeve bearing fan but it's a 92
millimeter so maybe you could upgrade it
in the future
anyway I don't spend too much time in
the cooler so let's move on the
motherboard is the FM to a 78 M ITX from
asrock this is also a fairly budget
oriented motherboard as it uses the a 78
chipset but it is fairly inexpensive
this also came with a $30 million rebate
so it made it very cost-effective but
it's got six SATA 2 ports it's got a
nice finish I mean as far as the color
it looks pretty good it's got your
expansion slot for PCI Express so we
could drop in a graphics card in the
future if we wanted to I maybe like to
see a couple more USB ports on this
board but as far as IO does it's got
everything you'd need to kind of get you
up and running and off the ground and I
think it's a great bang for the buck
might want to drop in a Wi-Fi card here
in the future maybe a USB one but other
than that I think we'll be set to go for
memory we have a 2 by 8 gate kit of
g.skill ripjaws x-series memory not a
huge fan of like the heatsinks or the
color on these but they are 2400 speed
which is pretty fast for ddr3 memory
with faster memory because we're using
the eye GPU that's in the 78 50 K and
pairing that with really fast
onboard memory is going to give you much
better performance if you're actually
running games off that eye GPU so
something to consider if you're going to
do that and that's why it was pretty
much the fastest slash cheapest 2x4 gig
kit that I could find and G skills
reputable brands so very happy with that
for long-term storage we have the a day
2 SP 550 240 gig SSD this is one of the
ones that was around 60 to 65 dollars on
Black Friday time period so fast SSD
storage 240 gigs which should be plenty
for now it was very inexpensive and
there's of course plenty of room for
upgrading or adding a
we'll drive in the future for our case
and power supply we have fractal
products and starting off with the power
supply this is a fractal Integra M 750
watt power supply this is actually the
power supply that I was using in our
htpc out here 80 plus bronze does a
great job it's partially modular stays
very quiet and it's just been great for
me so far it's also very short so it
will fit even in smaller cases and hey
it matches with the case itself which is
the fractal core 500 ITX case this is a
new one from fractal so it's got USB 3.0
up front tons of expansion options in
there even has some water cooling
support and also very nice it has a
sport for taller air coolers in there so
even though we've got a significantly
taller air cooler here than we would if
we're using the stock one it's still
going to fit in there anyway though guys
I'm really excited to get this put
together so why don't I stop talking and
start building
so there you have it guys this build
came together very easily and very
quickly thanks in no small part to the
fact that I had pre-installed the CPU as
well as the CPU cooler in the memory and
pre-installed the operating system happy
to say that this thing plays minecraft
like a dream
thanks it also in part to that SSD I
want really wanted this to be a fast
system for it to feel fast especially
since we're introducing it to kids we
used to like that you know the
smartphone type response that you get
now and an SSD is great way to do that
it boots really quickly and building in
the fractal Core 500 was really really
easy even though this is a mini ITX case
which I was kind of on the fence about
because I do want it to be upgradable
and that's not necessarily the thing you
get with an ITX case there's tons of
space in here you could even do water
cooling in the future if you wanted to
since that's an option so I'm hoping in
the future if my nephew does decide to
do some upgrades on this that he has
some expansion room in this case so then
of course limitless possibilities for
the future when it comes to PC building
modification and customization that is
all for this video though really hope
you guys have enjoyed it I have had a
wonderful time bringing you guys video
content throughout 2015 and I plan to be
bringing it right back at you in 2016
