of GPUs today with the RX 580 and rx 570
and just to be clear right out of the
gates these are not Vega GPUs
these are rebadge --is of the Polaris
based rx 470 and 480 but the good news
is that the 570s and 580 s are all
clocked faster and in some cases cost
less than their 400 series GPU
counterparts eight gig RX 5 ATS for
example will retail for as little as
$219 today I have on hand the asus strix
RX 588 gig and the gigabyte horas rx 574
gig price ranges based on information
that AMD sent me are between 169 and 199
dollars for five 70s which are all 4 gig
189 to 209 dollars for four gig RX 5 ATS
and 219 to 275 dollars for a gig RX v
ATS the new rx 580 will have a boost
clock of at least 1,300 and 40 megahertz
now as compared to the for ATS boost of
1266 although many versions you'll see
will overclock further like the asus
strix that I have here ran at 1411 hour
x5 70s reference boost is 1244 megahertz
as compared to the RX 4 70s boost of
1206 beyond that the specs are the same
but since there are no reference designs
for the 570s 5 80s
you'll be seeing unique designs from
adding card manufacturers some new and
some familiar that's pretty much all but
I did have some time to run a few quick
benchmarks which I'll share now as well
representing in video we have a gigabyte
GTX 1060 g1 gaming 6 gig which is
overclocked out of the box just like the
rx 570 and 580 I'm testing with an Intel
i5 7600 k overclocked to four point
eight gigahertz and/or z 270x gaming
seven motherboard with 16 gigs of HyperX
predator ddr4 memory running at 29:33
Windows 10 is on my 512 gig until 600 P
nvme SSD and I'm going to show the
gaming benchmarks via a new method
captures live on a separate computer so
let me know what you guys think about it
in the comments
so there you go guys that's all I have
in my rx 500 series for now I know this
was short and sweet but I'll post some
links to other friendly channels and
websites for further viewing or reading
