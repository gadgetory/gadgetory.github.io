hardware this is probing Paul episode
number 16 this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A series
that I do every month that's what makes
it monthly and if you're interested in
going back into the history there's a
playlist for you where you can go back
and look at the previous episodes all
the questions from today are taken from
the comments section from last week's
video
so let's dive right into it first
question here from Stephen Bach hey Paul
what would be the best CPU and graphics
card set up for a family room 65 inch 4k
TV build I feel like there's been more
interest in like the family room setup
the gaming setup for 4k TV since those
are becoming a lot more affordable so it
might surprise you given a lot of the
negative response to the recent launch
of Intel's X 299 platform but your
answer is going to be this CPU right
here which is the 77 40 X as well as an
X 299 motherboard you know something
something like one of these and
overclock to 77 40 X as much as you can
you'll probably be able to get five to
five point one gigahertz out of it if
you're going with the decent air cooling
setup maybe even a little bit more if
you go with an all-in-one however I like
to stay away from those for the living
room setups just because they can make a
little bit more noise depending on the
pump and everything like that pair this
with a GeForce GTX 1080 Ti of any
variety from any of the Nvidia sand
board partners and that will give you
the best CPU and graphics combination
because right now clock speed is still
king when it comes to graphics
performance and the 7700 K or the 77 40
X is basically the best chip for pure
gaming out there right now now all that
said you're going to pay an extra 100
bucks or so premium for the motherboard
with an X 299 configuration so strongly
can consider just going with a 7700 K
you won't be able to overclock it quite
as much but you'll invest a lot less in
the platform of course you got options
beyond that - you can look at Rison and
that kind of thing but you are going to
see a little bit of trailing off in the
actual gaming performance especially if
you're pairing it with a high-end
graphics card like a 1080i but for 4k
you should by and large be just fine so
I'd say consider those options but you
asked for what's best and best right now
is still going to be the options
until sigh thank you for that question
though Stephen let's move on to question
2 from Cody Espinoza hey Paul I'm
looking to upgrade my 1080p 60 Hertz
monitor had my eye on Asus PG 2 7 9 q
because I hear that high refresh rate is
one of those things you just don't come
back from I would agree with that Cody
my question is should I go for this or
wait Argo for 4k or ultra-wide for that
matter I have a GTX 970 but I'm looking
to upgrade in the next few months Cody I
hope when you do upgrade the prices have
dropped at least a little bit for the
GPUs because right now there are really
overpriced more on that and it's another
question that I'll be answering because
I use monitor though the RG Swift PD 2 7
9 q it is an absolutely gorgeous monitor
g-sync high refresh rate IPS panel so
it's got really good color reproduction
2560 by 1440 I think this is a great
option for you if you're looking to
spend around 7 to $800 on a monitor
there's a few reasons for that one it's
got that kind of trifecta stuff that you
want for gaming high refresh rates IPS
is great for color depth and then of
course g-sync some variable refresh rate
technology whether it's do you think
with the Nvidia graphics card whether
it's free sync with an AMD graphics card
you're going to want that for gaming if
you're moving up to the next level
beyond 1080 60 another reason this is a
good choice for you is you won't need
quite as much graphics horsepower to
push 2560 by 1440 versus 4k in fact
quite a bit less for 4k you really need
to be investing in the highest end
graphics cards right now I'd say
upgrading to a GTX 1074 you would be a
perfect choice going from your 970 with
the monitor like this and then of course
the other thing to consider is going to
be ultra wide if you want g-sync with a
34 40 by 1440 ultra wide though there's
quite a big price hike from there you're
probably have to pay over a thousand
bucks for that so all these things
considered Kodi
I think this monitor is actually a great
choice for you and I hope if you if and
when you actually get it you enjoy it a
lot because I certainly think you will
next up is mallanna mr. Ginetta Jena
bitch Millan murder Jenna bitch sorry if
I'm mispronouncing that hey Palma
digital artists working mainly in
programs like Photoshop I also do some
3d modeling and I'm thinking about
getting a new PC in the near future
would you suggest risin 1700 X or an
Intel 7700 K for such a build so where
as of the first question I
wholeheartedly
endorse Intel's skylake or KB Lake
architecture for your choice you
definitely want to go with that risin
1700 X anytime you're dealing with
heavily multi-threaded applications
especially ones that can take advantage
of threads beyond two or four cores
which games have a harder time dealing
with but enterprise or digital artistry
software tends to do a much better job
at especially rendering 3d models you
will definitely appreciate the
additional cores and threads you get
with the 1700 X compared to the 7700 K
Klaus Mathews asks my parents will be in
need of an upgrade from our old VHS
player to something that plays DVDs in a
very tight form factor should I get them
a console or should I attempt to make
them a cheap htpc in the same range this
is an interesting question not at least
because of the fact that your parents
are already using a VHS player but if
you want to get them into the next
generation I would consider if you're
going to go potentially 4k in the future
something like Xbox 1s that has a 4k
blu-ray player and that will allow you
to get all the way up from VHS
resolution to 4k which would be a crazy
jump if you don't have a 4k television
and you're just doing 1080 you're
probably going to be fine with DVDs and
blu-rays in which case I don't think an
HTTP C would be quite as practical in
the circumstances they're a little bit
more complicated I've got a with a
dedicated blu-ray player which you can
purchase and they're typically very
small and they're also a lot easier for
parents who just are used to using a
remote control can work with or if you
do want to go with the computer route
maybe consider even something like an
old laptop with the has an HDMI out that
has an optical drive in it might be a
simple and quiet and low-profile
solution for you to get your parents up
and running but I hope you can soon I
sure hope that they appreciate the
increased resolution jumping up from VHS
James would ask the question that
actually got a couple really good
responses and actually quite a few of my
questions that people ask on this video
get really good responses so I wanted to
give a shout out to any of you guys who
are controlling the arrant not trolling
but just perusing the comments and
actually giving good answers but anyway
James questions James Woods question was
hey Paul I built species past you with
Samsung 850 Evo 250 gig I've been using
it's a lot more than I originally
thought so I'm worried about NAND
endurance and that maybe the SSD won't
hold up as long as planned is there a
way to monitor the remaining endurance
on the SSD and just to show you guys
this is the Samsung 850 Evo right here
250 gig version only cost about 100
bucks right now really good drive very
solid it uses 3d NAND and answers to the
question first from John Totten thanks
John for Shimon and download the Samsung
magician software definitely you want to
get that to go along with the 850 Evo
you can set it up to use rapid mode
which does some caching on your memory
which makes the drive even faster and it
will give you performance and
reliability statistics it also show you
how much you've written to the drive
overall and you probably find that
you're way way way under what it
actually is John Doe points out here
it's got a five-year seventy five
terabytes written warranty so if you
take 75 terabytes a thousand gigs per
terabyte that's 75 thousand terabytes if
you divide that by the number of days in
five years it ends up being about 40 or
41 gigabytes written per day which is
possible I mean if you're copying a lot
of video footage or something like that
I regularly shoot a video and then have
you know 40 to 60 gigs that I might drop
onto something but I don't do that every
day is a pretty slim chance that you do
to so download that software get some
actual stats on the drive and also bear
in mind that even if the man does wear
out if it gets past the point where it
can't be program erased anymore it will
go to what is known as steady state it
can still be read so you can still copy
the data off of it
you just can't write to it anymore in my
experience though when it comes to SSDs
dying it's not the Nan's that wears out
it's the controller but I believe with
your controller and the 850 Evo that's
not much of an issue
next question from mui copyright here's
a question for you - gee 4560 with a z
270 motherboard now and next year
getting on unlocked i7 or now just get
the g 4560 with a regular motherboard
and by regular I assume you mean non
overclockable so one of the budget
chipsets like a be 150 or B be 250 he
also says he doesn't care about AMD so
I'm going to skip over any rise and
recommendations that I might have given
here's a G 45 60 it's popular because
it's KB leak architecture it's low price
although right now
seems kind of overpriced you should be
able to find this for 70 bucks this this
is expensive on Amazon right now so
maybe maybe search around and find a
better price for it but it's dual-core
with hyper-threading and it's a great
entry-level chip but again you're not
going to be able to overclock on a
mother on an inexpensive motherboard you
can't overclock that Pentium chip anyway
but I would say take a look at z170
motherboards that are out there in the
market and definitely I would say
probably go for the upgrade path now if
you get a z170 motherboard it might not
out of the box be compatible with that
processor so maybe consider something
like an Asus board that has USB BIOS
flashback or gigabyte with their I
forget what they call it but it's
basically the same thing as USB bus
flashback that will allow you to update
your BIOS without needing a processor or
memory installed other than that you
might be able to find a z170 board that
says it's updated for KB Lake and it
should be compatible out of the box but
you can find those really cheap I mean
they're z170 boards I mean a lot of
these are open box on Newegg but down in
the 70 80 $90 price range I might
consider going more towards the say 100
ish 120 dollar price look for low-end Z
270 boards I look for a good deal on a
last gen Z 170 board and with a Z 170
board even if you get like a 7700 K or
7600 K in the future as long as the BIOS
is updated so the KB Lake is support is
there you will be able to overclock with
z170 or Z 270 so I think that would be a
good option for you and it would allow
you to get a lot more life out of that
system
also if you install windows on the
system with the motherboard you're going
to go through much more painful upgrade
process swapping the motherboard out and
you have to redo windows and all that
and you might lose your license too so
that's also something to consider a
couple more questions left
this one's from Tortuga Paul I got swept
away in the rising Radeon rx prices due
to mining cryptocurrency mining at
theory and that mostly is what's going
on right now that's causing all of the a
a radeon gpus to be sold out and/or
extremely overpriced he says I sold my
rx 474 a cool 350 bucks on eBay went to
go buy a GTX 1070 it's on the 10 70's
and the high $400 range or even $500
plus is it worth paying 500 bucks for an
aging 1070 or wait for Vega now waiting
right now is is
going to be a challenge because there's
no telling how long this current bubble
with the prices of certain crypto
currencies like aetherium is going to
last and how long it's going to be a
viable choice to use gaming GPUs - - now
you're in a situation where if you had
sold your first 70 and immediately
bought the 1070 you probably would have
been okay but now that all the Radeon
cards are sold out people are starting
to use Nvidia cards - might as well
they're not quite as efficient at it but
they still can get the job done now we
talked about this a little bit on the
live show yesterday and actually got
some feedback from people that the
higher-end GPUs and a video stack that
used gddr5 X instead of gddr5 don't
perform quite as well that means that
the GTX 1080 prices have yet to go up so
if you're looking at a gtx 1070 close to
$500 just get a gtx 1080 you're going to
get better performance and you're not
going to pay the ridiculously inflated
price that the ten 70s are going for
right now that said if you can't afford
the 1080 then it's probably just going
to be a wait-and-see game right now you
did get a nice return on your first 70
but the flipside to that is all the
prices are still high and there's really
no telling at this point when they're
going to come back down so and which had
a better answer for you than that but if
you're really considering going up
towards 500 bucks maybe just grab a 1080
I think that'd be a good choice for you
final question here from gigs alts boat
gigs Ultimo ten simple question from
simple man spaghetti or macaroni I
pulled this up because I thought it was
going to be an easy answer and then I
thought about it I was like well you
know when it comes to straight pasta if
I'm going to have you know some marinara
and some meat sauce or meatballs or
something like that I'm a purist I like
the spaghetti I think it's a it's just
it's what I grew up with you know Mom
spaghetti right however I will say that
when cheese is brought into the equation
macaroni and cheese like oh my god
I don't allow myself to eat it because
it's so good and I ate too much of it
but I guess I'm giving two answers but
those are my answers usually spaghetti
macaroni when cheese comes into play
anyway guys that's all for this episode
of probing Paul I really hope that
have enjoyed it of course leave me some
questions for next month if you want
down in the comment section down below
and again thanks to all the people who
have been down there answering people's
questions since it does take me about a
month to get back to them every time I
do this I do have one last plug since I
keep forgetting to publish this but this
is my p.o box pulsar for a PA box for
three to five if you guys want to send
me something we typically do mail time
every few weeks on the live show so send
me some stuff and I'm going to try to
publish this a few more places because I
keep it kind of hidden right now I'm
going to start putting it in my
description so people actually know what
where it is and Oh guys thanks again for
watching this video we'll see you next
