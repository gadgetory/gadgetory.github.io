out by getting all of your ingredients
tools and everything out and ready so
you can make use of them of course I
have the main ingredients for an apple
pie which is gonna be the apples
themselves I usually use a mix of these
right now I get some Granny Smith we got
some Honey Crisp which is the champagne
of apples and we got some Red Delicious
you're gonna want about 4 to 5 pounds of
apples per pie we're making two pies
today so we got about 10 pounds total of
course we also have the ingredients for
the pie filling which is going to
include cinnamon its nutmeg also some
sugar and flour and salt we got those
all over there for the Nutmeg wait those
are holes so we're going to use this to
grate them up I also got some measuring
utensils over here specialty tools we're
just going to be using the food
processor over here and then we have
this which is an apple corer slicer
peeler which is a fantastic contraption
for the crust I'm using an Alton Brown
recipe so we have butter as well as
shortening and I'm trying to keep that
cold so it's only out here temporarily
and then to go in that we have Applejack
and then that will also just be a mix
with flour and salt finally you've
probably got an old laptop or desktop
that you're gonna hand down to a family
member my sister in this case so you're
gonna want to make sure you backup
everything off of the computer and get
that on an external drive then we're
just gonna go over to restore since this
is on Windows 7 and we'll do the backup
and restore next we want to go into
advanced recovery methods and choose
reinstall windows
do I have an installation disk in it of
course I do
and with that kicked off of course we
have our recipe itself which I have
right here and if I'm on top of things
I'll transcribe the important parts and
put that in the video's description but
to simplify things first we're gonna
make the pie crusts put that in the
fridge second we're gonna make the pie
filling third we're gonna put the crust
in these and put the filling in it first
we're gonna cook it all and then we'll
be done starting with the crust we need
12 ounces of flour by weights this will
make two crests and I need to do this
twice because I need four crusts total
two for each pie
now that's grams gimme ances yeah
here we go six ounces of cold butter and
two ounces of cold shortening more or
less a teaspoon of salt a tablespoon of
sugar mix that real quick butter goes in
next I try to chop it into cubes it's
about half the butter we'll give it a
few pulses the other half of the butter
and the shortening now let's have to do
is add liquid until it all holds
together enough and you can use water
for that I'm going to use very cold
Applejack this is the last of my last
bubble and I'm trying a new technique
this time which is to put it in a spray
bottle so I can spritz it in which will
give me more even coverage and also if
you need to pick me up later on we got
more who works
so now you can see it's holding together
a lot more it's still a little bit
crumbly but I'll probably just give it a
little bit more than that it'll it'll
all hold together it's really the idea
is not to overwork it so I just want to
kind of gather it into a ball so I can
leave it to keep cool until I get the
other one ready oh wait I need two balls
I really want to make a joke about balls
okay so I got our two dough balls
roughly equal size I'm gonna put these
in the fridge to keep cool and do that
all again to make two more 12 ounces
flour sugar and salt
six ounces of butter 2 ounces of
shortening and more Applejack
we're now starting to watch our apples
and get them divided up into two batches
one for each pie now is also a good time
to start the oven up to 425 and of
course we should keep an eye on the
windows installation fortunately it's
moving along pretty reasonably this is
either the fun part or the crappy part
depending on who you are if you have
kids convince them that this is the fun
part because it involves manual labor
and it's a great way to you know get
someone else to do it but this as a
suction cup at the bottom and this is
actually made it's as a piece of marble
that's made for pastry we don't have the
best countertops in our kitchen
maybe we remedy it that's at some point
in the future but this is the surface
I'm going to be using to roll up the
pastry dough as well but anyway section
cut this to there let's go Elise on this
side there's a couple sharp pieces
stamped Essenza
watch out for those but the Apple gets a
fixed like so and you just give it a
crank and it's cores slices peels all at
the same time it's not perfect of course
but it saves much labor and you just
pull it off like that you're almost
always gonna need to clean some some of
this up with a paring knife bonus though
don't get too full on those pieces up
from there we just give it a few slices
and tada we're now prepared for apple
filling any reset grabbing an apple and
rinse and repeat
rollin out the dough is next so for that
I have a pastry rolling surface marble
slab got the rolling pin of course using
a piece or a silicon mat although
honestly I forget if this is a help or a
hindrance last time got some flour on
standby as well as a little bit of water
sugar your flour cinnamon nutmeg and
salt
this goes on to the apples this is about
the time you start wondering if you have
a bigger bowl also how is all of this
gonna fit into the into the pie you know
it's easier yeah it's probably good for
you this is the hard part I'm probably
not gonna do a good job at this one two
three go all things considered that's
not bad at all
Oh
should I have told you earlier that was
actually 12 ounces it had lots of apples
I forgot 12 pounds of apples I thought
it was 10 pounds of apples had some
apples surprise yeah yeah that's right
it'd be very tall well that's the other
thing I keep forgetting to do that's
been campus hey butter on top now once
again is it the moment of truth yeah
that's that's awesome
I did a little bit of flirting around
the edge just to seal the stuff up
butter on top and then I did some vents
along here as well nothing too pretty
here and sometimes you can do toppers on
top of this or a glaze or something but
we're actually ahead of time and we do
have a Thanksgiving thing to get to so
I'm doing the last bit which is to put
tin foil around the edge this is just
for the cooking process and this keeps
the edges of the pie from burning while
it cooks we're gonna keep this on for
about a half an hour of cooking and then
we'll take it off for the last 10 or 15
minutes and it goes now one of all the
Browns techniques is to take the cut
apples and drain them before you
actually add them and I did not do that
so if you're doing apple pie and you
want to have a little bit of a feel sake
do something like this
put it under the pie walk cooks that way
if it does bubble up and over the top we
won't have a burnt on a sugary mess on
the bottom of our oven and now we wait
30 minutes and then we'll take the
tinfoil off oh yeah
like one more minute
not too shabby
remember you should let the pie cool for
at least 45 minutes and you can take
advantage of this time to drive over to
your family's house for Thanksgiving
nobody you're not supposed to look at
the camera everyone pretend like there
is no camera store-bought pumpkin pie
which it will probably be okay
my pie is collapsed a little bit that is
because I did not drain the apples so we
lost a little bit of height there but
it's okay it's still gonna be delicious
yes my mom taught me how everyone this
is my mom and she's gonna she's gonna do
the honors and cut the apple pie now
the first slice is always the most
challenging to remove so it's probably
gonna come up and a bunch of pieces you
know looks so good yep I was showering
the apples that's okay
get to write them on the ice cream my
dad's a great actor
we are all so full and tired but guys I
just wanted to say thank you thank you

channel and this video in particular
