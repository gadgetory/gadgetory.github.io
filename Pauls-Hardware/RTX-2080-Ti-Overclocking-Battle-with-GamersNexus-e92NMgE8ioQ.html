it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more what's up guys
how's it going - welcome to Paul's
hardware if you were watching my channel
and many of the other tech channels over
the past 24 to 48 hours you probably saw
lots of coverage on the newly launched
Nvidia RT X series of graphics cards
which includes the RT X xx 80 and 20
atti
available in both defenders Edition
directly from Nvidia as well as many
third-party variants such as the Asus
GeForce r-tx 2080 ti that I have right
here the Strix version which has a
custom PCB and a 2.7 slot cooler and a
newly designed Finn stack and a bunch of
stuff like that so apart from all the
potential controversy about the prices
of these cards and how expensive they
are and how Nvidia is only catering to
the 1% and everything then another
question comes to mind for the pure
enthusiasts out there which is just how
fast can they possibly be as expensive
as it may or may not be is like 1,200
bucks for a 20 atti Founders Edition is
it the fastest card possible yes we've
already discovered that how fast can it
be when it comes overclocking and when
it comes to the founders Edition as well
as the third-party design so today is
gonna be my overclocking video I'm just
gonna be overclocking the cards and
walking you guys through the process
showing a little bit of the software
I'll be using but last night I was doing
some testing for this video gamers nexus
happened to be doing a live overclocking
stream at the same time and I thought oh
how convenient I will check that out and
then I brazenly tweeted a screenshot of
my fire strike extreme tests the
graphics test specifically because Steve
was trying to break they score of 7400
in that I didn't break 7400 but I got
well above 70 300 tweeted to him haha
Steve because he was still wallowing in
the 7200 range at that point of course
immediately after I tweeted his run that
he was doing right at the time broke
7400 and proved that I have very poor
timing in my choice to call Steve out
for not being able to overclock his card
as much as I had so apart from the
overclocking itself I do have a goal
to break 7,400 as well as to potentially
beat Steve's score which I believe this
top score with fire strike extreme
graphics test was 7432 so if I can do
that then yay I win if not then I guess
I'll have to tweet to Steve and let him
know that he wins he was using the EVGA
version of the 28 ETA I believe the SC
version so that said I think I need to
level the playing field a little bit
here because this is my test system
which I built in order to be portable
because I wasn't sure if I was gonna
need to benchmark while I was traveling
through Europe as a result I have a mini
ITX motherboard and I have a cooler
that's very good as a low profile cooler
but not as good as it could be which
means I'm not running my processor at
the 8700 K and as high of a frequency
I'm running at between four point six
and four point eight gigahertz depending
on how many cores are being used I'm
gonna see if first I can swap out my
cooler here maybe improve the cooling
just a bit so I can run at five
gigahertz which is what Steve was
running at so for that I'm just gonna
swap in this cry rig h7
alright guys I've got the testbed
reconfigured Claire rig h7 on top not
the quad Lumi because we've already got
enough mismatched color stuff going on
because I put a couple not two of fans
on there so we got push-pull these are
the Noctua a 12 X 25 pwm fans so some of
the best fans you can get for pressure
environments such as with an air cooler
I wasn't quite able to hit 5 gigahertz
caps blue screening there this might be
because of the motherboard it might just
be because my 87 under K doesn't want to
hold that high of a frequency I was able
to hit 4.9 though we're not getting too
hot up into the mid-80s while testing
and I managed to run time spy extreme to
get a baseline run with the 28 e TI
founders Edition at stock speeds and we
hit 6565 o 1 is our current score and it
looks like our GPU clock hit about 1800
max although in my testing for the video
I posted yesterday we were running
around 1740 to 1750 well under load with
it for an extended period of time
that said though let's actually try out
some overclocking here we're going to be
using the EVGA precision x1 utility
which does have the fancy new stuff
integrated into it for example we've got
a temperature tuner here where you can
set a couple different inflection points
what I'm gonna do here with the
temperature tuner is just set everything
to max so I'm scrolling that over the
right 87 degrees is the max temperature
limit for the 20 80 and 20 atti
if it hits that frequency before with
previous versions of GPU boost it would
drop it all the way down to the base
clock now they'll drop it to an interim
frequency before it drops it further if
temperatures aren't getting better but
in this case since I'm trying to max the
card out I'm just gonna push everything
to right and say let the card get as hot
as it can go up to that limit before it
throttles anything we have fan speed
curves here available as well I'm going
to bypass those in favor of just setting
a really high fan speed so we can again
just try to see what the max frequency
we can achieve is and here is scanner
which is the new utility that NVIDIA has
integrated and it's starting to be
integrated into third-party overclocking
software such as EVGA is precision x1 I
believe MSI just rolled out afterburner
a beta version of that that has this
included as well although I haven't
tried it out and then here is the main
page where you do overclocking so you
can add frequency to the memory in the
top left here that you can add frequency
to the clock via and
set up here I'm actually gonna punch in
a hundred to give us a hundred point
offset on the clock frequency there's a
voltage slider here and according to
many people
gamers Nexus as well as their interview
with Tom Peterson this is still in many
ways a placebo slider it doesn't really
do a whole lot according to Tom Peterson
there is voltage Headroom but the cards
are capable of we don't know exactly how
much that is it is locked down by a
video to some degree the voltage slider
is supposed to open up that Headroom but
the cards only going to use the extra
volt voltage if it decides it needs it
and in my testing yesterday as well as
what I've seen so far from reviews
you're much more likely to hit the power
limit of the card before it actually
needs the extra voltage which is why
this voltage slider doesn't do anything
speaking of that power target though
that is right here and for this card for
the reference Edition founders Edition
cards we can do 123 the Asus card will
be able to hit 125 we get a whole extra
two percentage points of power there and
I in my opinion the reason Steve was
able to beat me is the EVGA cards were
able to ramp that power limit all the
way up to 130 so who knows if there's
gonna be a maybe an updated v bios or
something about that will allow me to do
that in the meantime now we're just
gonna set this power limit to max hit
apply and then I'm just pulling up gpu-z
here this is the new version that just
launched yesterday also I'm by the way
using the newest version of the Nvidia
drivers for 11.6 3 that also launched
yesterday along with the launch of the
graphics cards but the GPU clock as you
can see plus a hundred points brought it
from 1350 to 1450 for the base boost
clock is also reflected down there and
for now I'm gonna leave some of these
monitoring utilities up well I run this
benchmark one more time and we're just
doing the GPU test so we can
specifically try to beat Steve score
with just a bit of a modest overclock
here plus 100 on the GPU not messing
with the memory yet and we of course
have maxed out the power slider too all
right we have our first successful
overclocked test and I must admit here
that my CPU overclock is being a little
unstable again probably a motherboard
limitation
I'll hopefully fix that in the future
but I did add a little bit more a
voltage in order to maintain that
stability because we blue-screen two in
the first test but we got through an
extreme custom run for just a graphics
core and we scored 6864 and just two
rear efference my overclock settings
here haven't touched the memory yet we
got plus 100 on the GPU we maxed out the
voltage slider placebo we've got how 223
or max on the power target and I did
bump the fans up I think I forgot to
mention that fans are running at 81%
speed so they are a bit more noisy now I
hope that's not picking up on my mic too
much but let us proceed with some
additional overclocking what I would
normally do and I'd normally advise you
to do is take your GPU clock and bump it
by increments of maybe 20 or 25
megahertz and rerun the tests I'm gonna
jump all the way up to 175 here simply
because I have done a bit of pre testing
in order to determine sort of the
ballpark range I'm going to aim for I'll
stick with that I will hit apply
double-checking gpu-z down here to make
sure that that is reflected in there and
then we can jump in and run another test
bollocks
alright guys as typically happens when
you're doing overclocking I am running
into some issues with instability here
and there and I think this is mainly
because I was trying to overclock my CPU
because many people were running either
8700 K's overclocked or 8086 K's
overclock at 5 gigahertz either my CPU
or the motherboard is having a difficult
time maintaining that so as of now I'm
at 4.8 gigahertz across all cores
there's a bit higher frequency than I
was running for my general tests for the
twenty eighty and twenty atti at launch
but definitely a little bit slower than
what some others have run for this most
recent test i also cranked the fan speed
up to 91% which is what you've been
maybe hearing right now I just turned
that back down so you could hear me a
little bit better
now the original clock speed I tried
have a hundred and eighty didn't work
the tests failed so I bumped that down
to 170 and then 150 was still failing
there interestingly enough I ran the
scanner utility on this when I was
prepping for my initial video and I
decided to leave overclocking out of
that and it gave me a recommended
overclock of plus 148 even though I
failed the test at 150 I dialed in plus
148 and that ran successfully just now
and
saved a score of six thousand nine
hundred and sixty four which is again up
from the last test you ran of 6864 and
of course from the baseline of around
sixty five hundred now this might be a
very good indication that the scanner
utility in here is actually somewhat
functional again I'm not going to deal
with that much right now but I think for
the time being I can call this our max
clock on this particular GPU which is
plus one forty eight when it comes to
the clock speed max frequency it was
hitting was 2040 megahertz although
while running the test I imagine it was
dipping down a little bit below that
probably in the 1900 range
I'm not running these actively so I
can't show you that right now but from
there I'd move on to overclocking the
memory and most people who did
overclocking with the launch reviews
yesterday we're achieving about plus 800
on the memory so again normally I would
start out a little bit lower than that
and work my way up before but for the
time being I'm going to add our plus 800
we should see that reflected on the
memory frequency listed over here and
from there we can go ahead and run our
benchmark again to see if that improves
our score so this test what the memory
cranked up actually forgot to re
increase the fan speed but let me point
out why that actually didn't matter in
this test because for one our max
temperature was only 76 degrees Celsius
so that's is prior to the maximum
throttle points and also if we look at
the performance cap reason here as it
slowly goes away on my tech power up
histogram its power the power limitation
is what is causing this
graphics card to not run at a higher
frequency for longer to not draw more
power overall and this is one of the
limitations that really there's not a
whole lot that you can do about unless
you have a manufacturer overclock card
with software that allows you to
increase that power limit beyond what
it's at so I think at this point because
we did have a successful test we scored
71 16 which is pretty good but without
being able to increase that GPU clock
speed higher than what I'm at right now
I don't think we're gonna get a whole
lot more by increasing the memory
frequency I might be able to go a little
bit more from here but since I got that
second card to test this one of course
is a third-party manufacturer design
with a custom PCB but I know they also
redesigned the cooling solution on this
card but they also did a new bracket
actually a double wide slot bracket that
goes down the entire length of the car
to prevents GPU sag while that's sitting
in the slot and one cool thing about
this card is there's an actual surface
mount button right here to turn the LEDs
off press that button car goes
completely dark if you really hate the
RGB LEDs Asus root has provided you with
a simple way to just get rid of them on
the card and you don't need even to get
into the operating system and mess with
software they've also redesigned the
fans they actually have a circular ring
around the outside so the fans can spin
at a higher rpm while having minimal
instability and they redesign the fin
stack underneath there if you compare
this to the old version of the Strix 10
atti
you can just see there's a lot more fins
available that the fan is directly
pushing against as opposed to the
circular bracket that was there before
all that said though I'm going to shut
down or refresh the driver and switch
over to the Asus card and I'll be right
back
and Rebekah got the easiest card
installed did a driver refresh and I
have just loaded up times by extremes so
that I could get a baseline test running
this at its stock frequencies if you're
wondering what the stock frequencies are
same base clock at 1350 as the reference
design or the founders Edition it does
have a slightly higher boost clock 1650
megahertz
versus 1635 and then of course it might
also run a higher frequency over time
depending on the temperatures and
everything involved but for now we have
a baseline score of six thousand six
hundred and seventy-eight for this card
which is a hundred and seventy seven
points higher than the founders Edition
card so we are seeing some value to this
asus strix version of the card right out
of the gate since we theoretically
assume it's got a better and beefier
cooler on it again that's theoretical
because I haven't tested it myself just
now but according to Asus it is a better
cooler and now we can move back into
some more overclocking I'm still using
EVGA precision x1 for this asus has
their own software as well it's called a
GPU tweak and at this point I do not
believe it has been updated yet to
support the new 20 series cards although
I'm sure it will be soon so we're gonna
stick with EVGA and again since I've
already done a little bit of testing
with this card I'm gonna jump up to some
settings that I am fairly certain we
should be stable at so I'm gonna add 150
points to the clock I'm gonna slide our
placebo slider all the way to the right
once again I'm going to max out our
power and GPU temperatures and again I
believe that's because of the V BIOS on
this card we can get a little bit more
our power slider up 225 now instead of
hundred and twenty-three which is what
we were limited to but the founders
edition card I'm also going to crank up
the fan speed let's connect those
together I'll just go for 80 right now
since you don't want things to get too
loud although they are getting to be
louder
looks like our temp tuner is already
maxed out so we'll hit apply and then
again here on gpu-z we can see that our
GPU base clock has jumped up by a
hundred and fifty megahertz as well as
our boost clocks so let's go ahead and
run the test one more time so here we
have a successful initial overclock we
jumped from 66 78 to 7099 so some very
verified improved performance there and
also if we're looking at the GPU
frequency we were at 2070 max frequency
although again I'm not measuring this
while it's running so I can tell you
what it's running at stable but who
cares about what it's running at
long-term all I care about is attempting
to beat Steve scores so from here we
shall proceed and push our overclock a
little bit more so here I'm gonna cheat
just a little bit or at least reference
some of the testing I was doing last
night's which was with this asus strix
20 atti and basically I got a maximum
score I was able to break 7400 although
I was not able to beat Steve score of I
believe 7432 was what he topped out at
the settings I was using I was actually
a pretty significant memory overclock at
1100 I mean I'm not gonna mess with this
yet but the GPU clock frequency that I
maxed out at and this was very specific
was 178 if I pushed it to 179 or 180 it
was crashing out of the program so I
believe that's our maximum clock offset
everything else was pretty much the same
so I'm gonna take these settings at
least as far as the GPU frequency goes
and plug those in actually let's let's
try this to see how accurate that was
last night I'm gonna jump to 180 run
this test with everything else the same
haven't even overclocked a memory yet
let's see if I can prove that that is
the max GPU frequency that this card is
able to hit at least with the current
power limitations that are in effect if
history is any indicator if this is
gonna crash it's gonna happen within the
first three or four seconds of the test
running right there easily I was able to
predict that so again perf of concept
just bumping that down to megahertz two
megahertz to see if that will make all
the difference
and back into the test alright here's
our overclocked test I was correct
that's we were able to run through it
smoothly with the plus hundred and
seventy eight setting an EVGA precision
x1 I would also like to point out that
we run in the fans at eighty percent
speed but they are keeping things nice
and chilly max temperature and the GPU
is only 58 degrees Celsius our result
though was 71 32 so we have managed to
outpace the twenty atti founders edition
the max score we got there was 70 116
and that was with the memory offset
included too so now that I'm pretty
confident that I fit the max GPU
frequency that we're gonna hit we can
start working on the memory and here I'm
gonna jump to a thousand which already
is higher than we did before but I was
running this memory as fast as 1100 last
night so hopefully this will work again
here just double-checking gpu-z to make
sure that our over clocks have taken
effect and let's run the test one more
time so we actually had a crash when I
first tested this and I was like no I
refused to accept it so I just ran the
test one more time and we were
successful so we have a score of 73 83
guys also I should point out here when
it comes to overclocking I'm
overclocking to attempt to achieve a
specific score with this hardware
configuration the way I'm going about
this is trying to achieve that high
score but this is not the way I would do
it if I was talking about something that
you want to run long term this is a good
way to do it if you're trying to beat
that score but after I sort of saw the
peak of what I was able to achieve I
would always want to dial things back a
little bit if I was looking for
something I wanted to run 24/7 but with
our score here of 73 83 we're just shy
of that 7400 mark that Steve was trying
to beat yesterday I was able to beat
that yesterday again just by one point
but we're not quite at my max memory
frequency yet either so let me crank
that up to 1100 which was where I was
before and that's actually how I got
that score of 70 401 we'll run it again
and then I'll see if any little minor
tweaks here and there can help us out at
all beyond that because I mean if I can
beat Steve I'd be happy to I'm not
really expecting to right now because of
the way the card is performing but we'll
see
huh
that's so close close is about fair so
guys I am one point away
I am literally one point away 74 31 is
what we've achieved right here which is
good that's very good I'm gonna have to
say compared to what I was able to hit
last night which was 74 oh one
I think the increased clock speeds on
the CPU probably helping a little bit it
is a little bit cooler now than it was
last night I'm gonna just just drop a
little bit more memory frequency here
since that seemed to help us before and
I'm gonna see
so click minor change I just added 50
more points into the memory run it again
and keep our fingers crossed they went
down 7411 our score has dropped
obviously there's a margin of error for
any tests to run I could have run this
test with the exact same settings and it
could have gone up or down a little bit
but when it drops after you increase
something might show when you're a
cheating diminishing marginal utility or
it's just diminishing improved returns
from that actual setting let's try
something a little different
I'm gonna go 1080 I'm gonna set this to
1080 which obviously is a reference to
the 10th series of graphics cards which
maybe as a secret setting that you can
use with this to improve your
performance and then we'll run the test
again I'm not obsessed at all about
beating steep scores alright here comes
here comes
I did it I beat Steve 74 35 suck on that
Steve three points hired right okay I'm
waiting for gamers Nexus to inevitably
answer this video with probably their
water-cooled mod on their 1080 Ti and
we'll see how that works out but for now
I win with my massive x by extreme
graphics score of seven thousand four
hundred thirty five the score to beat
technically it's already been beaten by
quite a few people who have done liquid
cool liquid nitrogen cooling and exotic
cooling on the twenty eighty TI which
has already happened but guys this has
just been sort of my first introduction
testing out the overclocking
capabilities of the 2080 ti it's nice to
know that there is some Headroom it's
not nearly I'd say the level of headroom
that we had with the past generation of
cards but you can still get a bit out of
it and it's good to show that the
third-party designs are at least showing
some benefit some improve performance
compared to the founders edition
although again this will largely
significantly depend on the GPU that's
in the card that you get the quality of
that GPU itself the ASIC quality itself
can often determine your overclocking
capabilities but if there is one
significant reason to upgrade to the
third-party manufacturer cards it is
that power limit because I think it's
pretty evident that increasing the power
limit is going to increase the potential
overclock that you get for now though
thank you so much for watching this
video hit the thumbs up if you enjoyed
it and everyone go tweak to gamers Nexus
f to pay respects ripped yen all that
good stuff thanks for watching guys and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
