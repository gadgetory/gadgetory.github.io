back to Pauls hardware I have a massive
amount of boxes that I'm surrounded by
right now so I have no choice but to
unbox them all in the most professional
manner that I deem possible also want to
point out that you guys might also have
some boxes arriving we just passed Black
Friday I have a couple videos on that so
check links in this description for
stuff I'm unboxing today I don't even
know what's in all these yet but also
check out my recent videos on deals and
stuff if you're looking for more stuff
to buy for this holiday season because
there's lots of deals going on out there
all that said though let's get started
and start unpacking things I don't even
know where to begin the RC 100m vme SSD
and XS 700 portable SSD are both powered
by toshiba's advanced 3d BICS flash
memory meaning you get solid-state
speeds at an affordable price the XS 700
is a wicked fast external drive with USB
3.1 gen2 via a type-c connector and the
RC 100 may be small but it's MDOT to
nvme interface means sequential read and
write speeds at well over 1,000
megabytes per second
click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more first package
here is from Amazon and actually pretty
much know what's in this the only reason
I don't know what's in this is because
there's actually multiple packages I
have from Amazon that are coming in
right now so I don't know what all is
included in this one but I think there
might be some special for Joe
so to begin oh look we have multiple
things in here ah this something I've
been waiting on actually got one of
these last year this is a rode wireless
lab kits and actually I already have one
right here
the transmitter and receiver and I'm
intending to integrate this because I
can connect it to my sound board so we
can have better audio during our live
show the Kalin I do every Tuesday
meeting at 5:30 a.m. p.m. Pacific so I
only have one I wanted a second I
ordered a second it's now here so I'll
be integrating this into my sound
solution very soon and I'm happy about
that but also we have I got these with
some of these oh you know what's sad
though that's not right I'm sorry dude
none of this is for you
I totally teased Joe with like hey I'm
gonna so I ordered Joe call of duty
black ops 4 because I'm trying to get
Joe to play more of you
I'm trying to get all of us to play more
video games I've been having fun with
that wanted Joe to be able to play too I
ordered it because it was on sale for 40
bucks at Amazon thought it was gonna
arrive today but maybe later in the
meantime though I have a little sound
splitter been doing some better
solutions for audio setup and capturing
here and I just I needed another one of
these it's just a little 8 inch sound
splitter cable which will be convenient
for various solutions so these are just
power extensions with USB included and
I've been working in the computer room
trying to come up with a better solution
there and I think what I need are some
remote modules where we can plug in like
a laptop or plug in stuff to charge
without having wall warts plugged in
various places or having cable strung
everywhere so for that purpose I have a
couple of these these are intended to
actually under mount on the bottom side
of a desk for that reason I got these
ones I have little flaps on the side so
you can actually drill through to the
desk I don't like the ones that actually
have to sit in little groove there so
this is a longer one with four plugs and
more USB chargers in an actual switch
also has drill points on the end that's
kind of hoping these would be metal they
do appear to be plastic but it does seem
to be pretty sturdy plastic so a couple
different choices for those and I'm
gonna implement these in the computer
room and maybe elsewhere to give myself
more flexibility plugging stuff in but
also better cable management because you
know you get the cable and manage it and
wire it up all nicely so that you only
have to worry about the plug in pretty
sure I know what's in here ah this is
from Arctic not Arctic cooling are
different companies so Arctic makers of
MX for thermal compound which is very
good compound I am perfectly happy to
recommend it I've been using it recently
since they sent me a lot of it
and it's effective I have another one
there now it's appears to be a little
bit less packaging on that so I
appreciate that also they have some fans
which I am NOT testing or anything I'm
pretty much just telling you guys
these are fans you can be aware of exist
now bionics p120 there's 120 millimeter
and 140 millimeter versions of these P
stands for pressure these are all
pressure optimized so we have red X and
white accents we got a couple more
simple versions here in the middle
looking at the difference between these
two
we have PWM or
non pwms so options available there as
well and there's a quick look at the
fans themselves these slightly fancier
versions here with the accents on them I
was hoping this was kind of rubberized
it's slightly rubberized there but it
looks like kind of squishy around the
edge a very large swept fan blades and
there's only five blades per fan look
they spin
that's what fans should do anyway let's
move on let's see if we can make some
amends for Joe by opening this package
and I already know what's in this one
are you sure yeah but if I am correct
then maybe we have something that we can
actually hand hand over to Joe and see
if you can give it a shot not this so
the packages from Coolermaster this is
an 80 X 24 pin 90 degree angled adapter
they actually have a couple versions of
the DS one has capacitors inside which
supposedly makes your power flow more
stable and I don't I don't think that's
really gonna do a whole lot unless you
have a really really crappy power supply
now this is basically just a 90 degree
adapter so if you have ugly power supply
cables or just in your case it would
make sense to take your output from your
motherboard and angle at 90 degrees it's
got a core master logo on it that's
pretty much all there is to it Joe
obviously it's not excited about that at
all but maybe he'll be kind of excited
about this here we go
cooler master makes headsets among them
is the MH seven five one there's
actually a couple versions of this
there's a 751 and SM 52 this is the
slightly cut-down version this one MSRP
is for about 80 bucks but it's got the
headset as well as the boom mic as well
as an inline control so let's pop this
out of the box real quick see how it
looks timeless good looks premium sound
quality 40 millimeter neodymium drivers
plush cushioning for its PC ps4 as well
as just a standard 3.5 millimeter audio
jack interface and an omnidirectional
boom mic cooler masters new minimalist
logo it's growing on me I like it and
then inside we've got little manual the
foam protection headset itself ooh
detachable boom mic that just plugs in
with a little eighth inch plug
yeah Oh lovely velvet pouch and inside
we got our cables so very
straightforward they are nicely braided
and getting fully detachable so it's
good for portability if you want to wrap
it up and not worry about the cables
getting bent at angles right where it
connects and then this is another little
splitter so if you want to plug this in
to a laptop that has a multiple port guy
you can use that or you can use that to
split it out so you have set pretty it's
separated mic and headphones try they
actually do feel pretty comfortable and
they articulate nicely padding feels
fairly premium not just in the sound
quality of course right now but
articulate the mic right there we got
ourselves a headset so this is again the
cooler master mhm 75 won and I think
we're gonna hand these off to Joe so he
can use them in his video gaming
exploits you're welcome thanks
coolermaster you can play with all that
next up we have a couple packages from
Asus these are super serious cuz they
got these straps on them makes me feel
like there's something even more
important in here actually spoiler alert
I kind of already know what's in here
because it's actually labeled on the
outside of this box but hey there we
have a graphics card this is the asus
rog strict geforce r-tx 2070 so this
would be the 27 T which is the lower end
compared to the 2080 or 2080 TI and Asus
sent this over to me so I can check it
out I guess the Strix unboxing
experience always a pleasure
the asus rog Strix graphics card design
haven't changed up too much like in the
past couple years this is a design that
I like because it is very simple fairly
simple and straightforward you know it
has the angled gamer aesthetic for the
shroud and everything there and the
shroud is plastic which is probably my
main complaint about this I do like the
feel and look of a metal shroud but
plastic here doesn't look too bad it's
got some texture going on with it now
they were pretty good cooling solution
they've designed to your multiple heat
pipes large fence tax this is a fairly
thick card it's about 2.5 inches I think
they say 2.7
slots as far as the amount of space it
takes up but then they also have a very
sturdy retaining bar that goes down the
entire length of the card here and bolts
into the end piece here where your will
actually connect it to your case and
that actually does a pretty good job of
reducing GPU sag as well they also
include a backplate it's got an RGB logo
that lights up with the asus rog i there
- it has a brushed metal finish on the
back there - which also looks pretty
cool I'm going to attempt to keep this
protective cover on there so I don't get
it any bad fingerprints until we're
actually ready to fire this up and maybe
put it in a build or do some testing
with it or something like that in the
future for now though what else today so
send over next package for me soos this
one also aware of what it actually is
this one I have a little bit more
specific plan for because I was recently
since the $2,000 Intel 99 80 Extreme
Edition CPU there 18 for 16 thread CPU
which is super over-the-top and crazy
also effectively the same as the 79 80
XE but for all intents and purposes it's
a fast processor which is available on a
high-end Intel desktop platform and I
was thinking about doing a crazy
over-the-top build with it because I do
those up and enough and I think this
would be a good solution for it which is
the new Asus x2 99 deluxe
2 motherboard so if X - 99 and Asus has
done a refresh of some of their
motherboards X - 99 boards are still
compatible with the new 9000 series
high-end desktop processors but some of
these have improved their power delivery
or also added fancy new features now I
can't give you a full rundown of what
makes this difference from different
from the original X 299 prime but I
can't say it's got a fixed IO shield
there which I always like and then I
think they've added up here which I've
only seen on their hair and ROG boards
is this display right here so this is an
actual LED display it'll light up and it
can do graphics and stuff so she was a
prime logo so that's pretty nice other
than that pretty cool design overall I
liked all of the exposed fins here for
cooling of the V RMS over there
they did say that they improved the
power delivery on this board but I don't
know any specifics beyond that I got a
couple MDOT two slots and yeah just a
pretty cool aesthetic so I think what
I'm going to do here is do a crazy high
end build
the 99 80 xe2 way archie x28 ET is with
those EK water blocks that i got a few
weeks back and then i'll just throw in a
bunch of other ridiculous stuff it'll
make it like a white Thema because I
think that would blend in real nice only
a few boxes left actually three this is
an Amazon box but this is a repackaging
of some products that arrived somewhat
recently which I thought I'd just around
here to enhance the unboxing video these
are products from the Elgato ogatsu
it's recently acquired by Corsair so my
friends at Corsair have hooked me up
with some I'll got those stuff we've got
the stream deck mini diamond little
stream deck this is made for streamers
but if you need an external device
connected to your computer that with
little buttons you can program with
macros and lots of other cool stuff an
actual displays on each button you can
add icons to a pretty cool thing the
mini is a mini version of the full
version this is the full stream deck and
I've said this before but we should
really get these integrated actually now
that I've finally done my refurbishment
of my streaming and capture system I
really need to get at least one of these
integrated there and then maybe we can
add some some flare and some special
sound effects or something to the live
show that's what the live show really
needs more sound effects next box is a
large one this one is from our friends
over at gigabytes tape is low like
somebody's somebody stepped on this box
there's a footprint so that's okay cuz
gigabyte products are very sturdy so
here we have the latest g-force r-tx 20
atti from gigabyte there Oris line which
is their higher end gaming line and it
comes with a 20 80 TI when it launched
there were third-party add-on board
partner cards available pretty quickly a
sort of variety of those this is
representative of like the higher tier
of cards but still I don't think the
highest of the high end I'm imagining
we're still gonna be seeing like the MSI
Lightning equivalent or the Asus Asus
highest end rog card they usually do
some special variant or maybe a hybrid
water-cooled one but this is gigabytes
new design for the Auris extreme and I
think this deserves its own video
because it's a crazy high-end graphics
card 20 80 TI of course so I'm gonna do
a separate video where I unbox this and
actually do some game testing on it but
just to give you guys a quick look
they've got
new cooler design here I actually think
it looks pretty cool it's got some RGB
lighting on it they've done some custom
work with the video outputs as well so
you can have three HDMI outs or three
display ports out there special
windforce fans it has a fan in the
middle that spins it a different
direction than they do on the outside
and then we got direct heat pipe contact
for the cooler as well as a bonus VGA
holder prevent some GPU sag with that
finally the last package here gets the
award for tapes the most the most tape
used in any package was delivered and
this package I also I know where it came
from and I have a vague idea of what's
in here it came from g.skill so I know
there's some memory in here I think it's
a fancy high-end memory this is also a
pretty large box so what else did they
include I don't know yeah this is never
that is good for this one first oh well
this would appear to be the g.skill
trident zero which we were first
introduced to at Computex back in june
of this year the memory for the one
percent I believe was what I called it
because is very bling and fancy looking
oh so there we go that appears to be a
silver finish even comes with a little
YP cloth so you can protect that
gleaming coat and then we've also got
the Trident serial gold which just gold
I mean it's gold now the first thing
that comes to mind for me getting this
out is how fast are they these are 3,200
speed castle NC 14 the actual timings
are fourteen fourteen fourteen thirty
four at 1.5 volts and this is a four by
eight gig kit for 32 gigs total I feel
like I'd be remiss to show you guys this
memory and it's blingy fanciness without
also showing you this g.skill flare X
stick or for that matter there's
standard RGB memory which is the exact
same speed and timings there is
effectively zero performance difference
between this stick which is just as a
black heat spreader and no other
lighting or shiny gold or silver finish
and this stick which I'm imagining is
going to cost a little bit more although
I don't know immediately the MSRP of
these and told by g.skill that we're
actually not expecting these to go up
for sale
until next year so q1 or q2 of 2019 but
for now we're at least able to give you
a quick look at them and I believe
giving you a better look at them will be
helped out by this little package the
box is a USB plug on the back of this
box there is a little drawer at the
bottom of this box with a USB cable it's
convenient and then the top of this box
is DIMM slots so this is a display case
so I'm pretty sure g.skill has sent
these out in order to help us reviewers
out because whenever you get a new
memory kit like this you know plug it in
and give it a look especially if it's
something where aesthetics is the focus
like this one but sometimes it can be
challenging to get a test bed out here
and swap the memory and memory in and
everything so once I get these
protective pieces off and these are
metal heat spreaders by the way I'm sure
this is just a paint finish on it but
that's metal so that's nice it's hot
plastic here is is plastic but it's sort
of got a bunch of facets to it to kind
of reflect refract light but let's just
pop these into our memory testing
testbed there we go now we plug in our
USB and now
so I was distracted by the immense
beauty the color the refraction of light
has never never really seen anything
like it guys that is the g.skill trident
zeruel memory kit displaying the version
in gold here also available with the
silver finish coming soon or at least
next year I guess this is just a teaser
I don't think it's gonna come with this
box but I imagine this box will come in
handy in the future if I ever have any
other RGB memory that I want to give a
quick test tube and powering this off of
the keyboard over here by the way
because it apparently just needs a
little 5 volt connection from a USB plug
but guys that is pretty much gonna wrap
it up for this video this has been my
massive unboxing of many things
including the new g.skill tried NZ royal
RGB memory with the fancy lighting
configuration and of course all the
other products that I've also unboxed
I'll post links to as available in the
description down below if you guys want
to check it out also don't forget that
