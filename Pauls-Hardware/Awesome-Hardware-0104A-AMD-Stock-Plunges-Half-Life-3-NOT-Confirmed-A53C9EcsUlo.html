click that that was a mistake alright so
we'll just we'll just assume it started
hey how's it going there YouTube and
twitch welcome to awesome hardware live
show technology beer me and Kyle Tuesday
evening 5:30 p.m. Pacific time and yeah
enjoy yourself so hope you guys are
having a good one we certainly aren't we
have some random tech news to talk about
today and as I guess that's intro yep
those are all the things we wants to say
at the beginning of that goes I figure
we drag it out longer than that
we do say so many things besides that
right so let's let's go straight into
into pimping our stuff then - if you
guys want to help support this channel
my channel Kyle's channel our stores are
bit with tech slash store or Cal stories
he's got some shirts and some some
glasses and some mugs there the glasses
are now 20 ounce they used to be those
are bigger 16 ounce I think these are 16
ounces they're larger so they're
girthier they're girthier they Morgan
Lee here at the 20% more girth added
girth yeah on Kyle's store my store has
the same amount of girth because it
didn't need anymore
my pub glass are also 20 ounce in their
English pub glasses they're very high
quality so I check that stuff out if you
guys buy stuff during the show we will
say thank you by outing your name and
the word Johnson towards the end of each
half and then also we're going to be
doing the second half of the show on
Kyle's channel which is a bit wit so
thanks for being here guys and what now
of course everyone can see everything's
fine everything's fine yeah what are we
drinking today today we're drinking left
overs I'm just drinking a little some
leftover beer from past weeks this is
from the Sam at Sam Adams Kit noble
pills is yeah that's what I'm just a
little something little something from
Lagunitas Brewing Company I don't know
exactly what kind of beer it is it's
just a sole something it's it's it is
stronger it's like 7.5% yes it's like
drinking a beer and a half yeah it's
good which is good because we're Kyle's
house today
alright so random news for the beginning
of the show if you guys weren't already
aware Kyle and I
participated in scrapyard Wars a few
weeks back was when we actually did the
thing Linus and Luke from Linus tech
tips came down and visited us here and
we did that all here and everyone has
been anxiously awaiting wooden scrap
yard words is actually a launch I can't
tell you guys when that's actually going
to be in fact maybe it's already been
mentioned over on their social medias
I'm not really sure I don't want to
spoil anything because it's their show
I'm gonna tell and let them tell but
let's just say it's gonna be soon and I
got to watch this first episode you
already saw how much first episode how
yeah how'd you do that
I answered Edie when he tried to get in
touch with me when did he try to get in
touch with me I don't know but I keep
telling him that you have information
about like certain stuffs that we bought
during the event and stuff like that and
and I thought I assumed he had some
method of communication with you know I
mean email usually through even talking
on Google Hangouts April 3rd
yeah hangouts Oh hangouts I haven't
gotten any hangouts I don't know anyway
point is how do shits a lot of fun I'm
looking forward to it wait who wins
what oh um oh sorry you asked for that
right as I saw something on Twitch the
completely distract and man your AC
needs to be needs to be it is really
hard you're right yeah it's not working
for some reason it wasn't working large
yesterday or maybe the intake needs to
be cleared out I can make it stand in
here remembering a fan should I bring a
fan share if I want I mean I'm not gonna
complain it's hot as balls is a little
warm I'll pass out mid show if I don't
get there alright um
let's dive right into it since my first
segment is is like a band-aid I'm gonna
get the crappy stuff out of the way
first first segment is no not that first
segment is oh joy
oh joy is usually the segment where I
tell you all bad news and and there's no
solutions to anything there might be one
or two solutions in the mix today for
the just for the purposes of
categorization everything sort of fan
this is a piston plastic circle this is
a freaking Dyson yo it's a plastic this
this is like this is like so
technologically advanced you don't even
know
you don't even know what to do with it
all right it's a Dyson Sphere
it's a Dyson it's another Dyson Sphere
it's a Dyson circle
all right look like you know I look like
breeder club you're completely blocking
the camera yeah don't want to see your
face Hey uh to start with oh joy as we
talked about last week net neutrality is
under attack again and I really quickly
want to tell you guys how to make your
voices heard if you happen to be a US
citizen you want to talk about this
thing talked about last week it's pretty
lame net neutrality was air net service
providers were classified as title two
as a service provider I'm not saying
anything any words properly right now I
hope someone quotes you from the show
and says yeah
that upset exactly just think a lame
never mind that the point is we were
happy with Internet service providers
being classified as title two with them
being held to standards of net
neutrality now they're potentially going
to change that hey that's nice I got a
bit of a breeze you're potentially going
to change that and here's how you guys
can go and comment on that now I'm not
going to tell you guys how to comment
obviously we've made our stance on the
matter very very firm but IG prized the
current dude in charge of the FCC and
basically you got to go to the FCC
website you go down there and the lower
left there and you can click on new
filing Express filing just a couple ways
of doing it the actual thing is called
the listing that for this is called for
storing Internet freedom because they
like to label things in ways that are
exactly the opposite of what they
actually do so go to the restoring
Internet freedom proposal on left you'll
see two buttons if you are if you're a
normal person click Express and then you
can fill out the thing if you're a
lawyer or professor and you want to
actually attach some like documented
material or something like that click on
new filing and then all that information
all the way by the way the information
that you fill will be publicly available
so this is part of the process of going
and commenting on their new proposed
notice the notice and OPR notice of
proposed rulemaking they
us kicked off I think about a week ago
and yeah go on there there's also some
examples towards the end of the article
of how you can how you can phrase
yourself if you don't know exactly the
words to say kind of like me right now
if you're if you have difficulty talking
and forming complete sentences towards
the end of the article there's also some
permit and some information to do that
thanks to TechCrunch for putting that
article up and I encourage you guys to
go and let the FCC what you think about
net neutrality rules because right now
net neutrality is in effect it's on in
2014 a bunch of ISPs Comcast several the
other larger ones started to severely
throttle Netflix traffic Netflix traffic
tanked prior to that there's no
precedent for neat for requiring some
legal rule to hold ISPs to treating all
data on the internet equally so that's
why from 2014 to 2015
first the FCC tried to - they tried to
just create some some rules about it
those are challenged by the ISPs by
Verizon and all the big ISPs and
overturned so the FCC took this next
step of classifying the ISPs as title to
common carriers so under those rules
there's there's there's a negative to
that in that like if certain apartment
complexes and that kind of thing under
title two you can actually have an
exclusivity agreement with an Internet
service provider but they're also held
to rules to that make sure that help
them just understand these four
standards for actually providing the
service so anyway I feel like I'm not
doing the best job of discussing this I
got it go watch last week's episode
because I feel like I did a better job
then why being this article and you can
you can you can let them know because
last year near two years ago yeah two
years ago in 2015 a huge reason why Tom
wheeler then FCC chairman made the
decision he did was because there was so
much feedback from the public and I'm
probably going to talk about this every
week until the this closes which this
first this first set
of open comments is goes until May 18th
okay let's move on other crappy things
for from the oh joy segment Intel has
patched so this is this this was solved
to some degree but this was also
discovered quote unquote apparently
recently by Intel and this is a
vulnerability that has been open and
exploitable in all Enterprise Core
processors for the last nine years
so that's Enterprise does not mean you
if you're a consumer if you using like a
core i7 core i5 core i3 that's not you
they were talking like the Zeon's the
server stuff but this goes all the way
back
see all these cores link Xeon should be
more secure than anything second gen
core was sandy bridge first gen core was
I always forget the the codename for
first gen west no south whatever
whatever the hell was I look at South
Lake South South Omani South Bridge
South Central LA probably like okay so
why what's wrong with your what your
mouse is broken no it's not oh maybe
it's because I it's because yeah sorry
Anthony because I have a tweet town
article coming up later is it really hit
I don't know the browser froze nothing
was happening and all I saw was the
tweak town article free--free doing
something to the tab just Apple is just
flashing regs like hey violently
flashing red okay no it's not alright so
anyway so that's what this affected this
vulnerability or the vulnerability was
was that the vulnerability was exposed
you're doing drunk enough I know you get
more liquor in you and you'll start
speaking clearly the vulnerability was
exposed through several technologies
that are built into the Xeon processors
active management technology or AMT
Intel standard manageability and small
business technology so is M&amp;amp;S BT these
are features for remote management
however they could be accessed
basically by anyone with a copy of a
hacker tool called Metasploit who is on
the same network so you need to be like
physically at the location but granted
that's pretty that you know that's not
all that difficult to do depending on
networks everywhere yeah or if your
network happened to have port 1699 to
open accessible to anyone in the world
which is pretty huge so intel has
released a firmware patch to fix these
vulnerabilities so that's all it took
was a patch right here so if you're an
IT professional or see a CTO or whatever
like that as Wendell recommended when he
is this is where I first heard about
this was Wendell tweeting about it
yesterday I believe in the day before
yeah you better better update your
I guess basically what you should do the
remote access vulnerability once again
does not exist on home users pcs if
you're using a consumer processor but if
your home users are using a xeon
processor i would imagine you would want
to do that as well I'm not exactly sure
how these patches are distributed in the
enterprise world so I would imagine
typically something like that you need
like a BIOS update and then that might
update the micro code on your CPU or it
might be a software thing I'm not sure
anyway
semi accurate s-- charlie'd immersion
the immersion I believe I don't know if
I'm pronouncing that right sorry check
charlie has known about these
vulnerabilities he says for over five
years and has over this period
communicated with dozens of Intel
executives about the security issues all
apparently to no avail this is according
to the hexxus article and their quote
from charlie it is suspected that the
vulnerability is currently being active
actively exploited in the wild though so
uh yeah again IT professionals make sure
everything's up to dates when it comes
to your Intel hardware all right next up
hackers hackers man there's just hackers
everywhere mad hacks uh orange is the
new black the entire first season and
not the entire first season most of the
episodes of the new season they're
coming out have been leaked online
do you watch orange is the new black I
do not not I do it but I know it's
popular show yeah I'm sure it upsets a
lot of people or actually makes a lot of
people happy yeah I mean and I'll enjoy
the show
the production so I guess it depends on
what you what you think about this type
of thing whether or not this is even
fitting for the oh joy segment yeah but
let's let's go on the side of you know
you know that stealing is bad and
whatever it is oh joy whether or not
it's sarcastic is okay yeah we'll go
with that sure um anyway the hacker
basically in question here gained access
to the network of Larsen Studios they're
an audio post-production company that
serves many major television production
companies the perpetrator is either an
individual or group going by the name
the dark overlord they have reached a
number of small and mid-sized
organizations don't tot the dark
overlord Kyle
they have breached ass number of small
midsize organizations over the past year
but this was one of their their big
breaks was it last year they stole nine
episodes of this upcoming season of
Netflix's orange is the new black
they've also claimed to have accessed
content from 36 different television
series --is as well as one film since
the the production company the larson
studios that they are you know that it's
not just Netflix that they are working
with yeah so that's not known I mean I
guess you could look at who Larson
studios clients are but that might not
be public as far as what what else the
hackers might have gained access to but
they originally were attempting to
extort 50 bitcoins directly from Larson
and they put a deadline in January to
deliver the 50 bitcoins but they did not
the bitcoins were not since deadline
passed so they went to directly Netflix
and they're like alright Netflix
we got your show we're gonna we're going
to release it Netflix also did not
respond so they have been posted on
April 29th just three days three for how
many where however many days that was
ago dark overlord posted the links on
Twitter to the torrents for the
Downloads incidentally the website
Larsen Studios web site was based on
Microsoft's discontinued front page web
publishing tool which was once part of
the office suite back when a web
publishing tools part of the office
suite so I guess another lesson learned
why would a production studio even have
50 bitcoins like why would you demand
that from them how would they even know
they demand payment in bitcoins so that
it's not traceable oh I see so the
production they're not assuming the
production company has okay Bitcoin but
they believe me all you but take your
money buy bitcoins I want to do this
give us a Bitcoin see okay that make
sense
interesting how much is that now how
much does a Bitcoin go for these days I
think is it over a thousand just just
search for Bitcoin value prices or
whatever oh 1478 okay so talking fine
time grand still holding their value
they're not bad okay 1 million Doug one
more story here for the oh joy cygnets
in front of you guys who are still
waiting for half-life 2 episode 3 or
half-life 3 confirmed no oh but perhaps
even more unconverted
or not confirmed or the opposite of
confirmed whatever you might call that
uh chats fallow check I believe that's
his ie pronounces a fellow chess
Chet Chet yes valid FA Chet
yeah balichek I think fellow check it
that seems anyway he's been working at
valve for twelve years and according to
game industry that biz he has left now
um he for dead he's ha ha ha that's
funny cuz he did he was a writer for
left for dead he is a writer show wing
he is a writer he was hired by valve in
2005 he went on to help develop the
unique voice behind 2 half-life 2
expansion episodes both portal games and
the left 4 dead series among other
titles he said there's nothing exciting
or drama-filled behind the departure
I worked there 12 years shipped a bunch
of great games and some amazing hardware
and wanted to change things up
there's no news on what's next etc I'll
let you know when that happens
 gaben he didn't actually the
gaben was that's me I hope not
oh hey okay I just just tried to process
my paper paint that's not full not full
attention anyway
I missed a valve also was during the ten
years since they announced half-life 2
episode 3 but not there's any news about
this
it's just clickbait it's a bunch of
clickbait that that is the actual news
which is that hey there's probably even
less of a chance now that that that
half-life 2 episode 3 is actually going
to come out something like that hire
some other writer who could easily do it
yep you can't just replace fellow check
man
sure you can can't just be like yep you
can't that's gonna just gonna fake
that's a Falchuk a fake you - that's
really stupid sorry ever regret saying
whoo all right I'm glad oh joy is over
we can move on respond to brighter one
more wonderful things because actually
it's hot and heavy hard way
whoo that's right whoo so the first hot
have you heard over talkie about
speaking of Zeon's this is since we just
talked about the story about the Zeon's
with eight or nine years of security
vulnerabilities going on who wants an
Uzi on me the intel has launched the
cabe you like base Zeon's the e3 1200 v6
family so pretty much keeping up with
their standard cadence of coming out
with the Enterprise version of the chips
that the consumers get within roughly a
few months after those trips themselves
actually launched so the Xeon e3 1200 v6
family is designed for entry-level
workstation small business servers and
storage servers there is a total of
eight processors that have been
announced this article's from an tech by
the way and they're all LGA 1151 socket
which is the same as e 3 v5 Zeon's
which is the same as skylake because
it's all the same same core architecture
there will be low-power versions of
these CPUs coming later on but these are
all four core eight thread or four core
four thread and they're all priced
pretty expensively I mean you can get a
fork or eight thread III 1230 v6 for 250
bucks so I don't know I mean I'm sure
there's going to be people who are get
these and be like I got the III till 30
B 6 and I got that instead of the 77 or
K and I'm smart and maybe would be
because sometimes getting the xeon
version
of the i7 especially the hyper-threading
enabled version of AI the i7 has been it
means the past of getting yourself you
know hyper-threaded enabled chip and
actually the the clock speeds on these
are not bad
I mean even that even that lowest end
fork or a thread is a 3.9 gigahertz
turbo
yeah for a Xeon that's pretty that's
update and everything else going up to
up the line is basically you're there
getting a clock speed bump or potential
you'll have an IG P the the skews here
that have a 5 on the end like 1275 and
1245 means that they have nigp or an
integrated integrated graphics they're
using Intel's HDPE 630i GPU it'll run at
speeds up to 1150 megahertz this is the
professional version of the HD 630 on
the consumer parts it has Intel's latest
gen 9 graphics architecture as well as
h.265 and code and decode which could be
useful depending on what you're planning
to use your chip for so if you're
looking for one of these eons and you
want to actually take advantage of h.265
encoder which I'm actually not that
aware of many software's that do that
does handbrake even use that yeah sure
no way I use 265 its 264 still I think
I'm not I'm not positive but h.264 was
pretty badass so so cool
nice that's available on the Zeon's
these are 72 wata a TDP for non IGP
models 73 watts the only one extra watt
TDP if you have the graphics processor
in there too hot I draw the line at 72
sorry 5
yes it's waiting for my beer um yeah
there are no so whereas when kb lake
launched there was new chipsets that
came out if there's a big one in here I
want the big one she said uh huh whoa
that is a big one hey I'll playing beer
company happy birthday Alpine's
delicious lovely good brew and this was
for this is the last beer that my sister
got me for my birthday I'm nosing called
hoppy birthday I have an opener too I
think it's an IPA I know you don't like
IPAs all that much that's alright I'm
fine with IPAs I felt really I've been
enjoying about learn more well that's
good
I find her you'll enjoy this one too I
find nothing at all less appealing about
them as compared to
other beers it's great considering you
used to hate them just not too long ago
yeah I despised them really came around
really came around you yeah I learned my
lesson no hops or where it's at
you need as many hops as possible all
the cool kids are doing it we want
happiness what is what does happiness
mean to you
money can't buy happiness that's true
actually
it's hilts it with beer a lot yes uh
sorry I ran out this stupid Zeon story
uh who even uses these you know if you
have an existing seat 232 is C 236
motherboards those are the enterprise
chipsets that went along with the the e5
series you just need a BIOS update to
work with them blah blah just the same
as sky like to keep you linked and um
interesting thing here at the end though
so there's no new chipsets for these KB
Lake based Zeon's right sure remember
that on the consumer side with z170 and
z2 70 you need z2 70 and a KB like
processor in order to support opting
mm-hmm but here you don't these support
obtain even though they're not new
chipsets wait wait what chip siddhartha
cc2 32 c 236 okay so Ian Ian points that
he sins like it is therefore odd that
Intel is announcing obtained memory
support with III 1200 v6 Zeon's this
essentially means the octane memory
support is already baked into the
chipset it is merely a firmware approval
at a CPU and chipset combination in
order for it to be enabled which means
that like I don't any requirements for
octane and like that they all that all
that is just it's so basically kinda
yeah and I can just patch it into it
they could you know patch support all
rights you guys might have heard this
this already this this this news came
out last week here's PC world article by
Brad sharkus look at that monitor it's
the Acer predator X 27 we sync HDR
monitor holy crap it's awesome
beast best monitor best one talking
about it base there was an event in New
York Joker was there I saw him tweeting
about I think - was there tooths the
next at Acer events
was on Thursday that would been fun to
go to last week why don't we get invited
I vowed to do no more travel before
can't be - that's true yeah um but
anyway here's their video on its 27 inch
not salty at all
Wow damn it 27800 just week 10 see it's
been tweaked town real oh Jesus why's it
refreshing when all this gets all why
tweak town why anyway of a calamity 27
inch 4k resolution 144 Hertz refresh
rate g-sync HDR 1000 nits of brightness
most monitors are more like 400 it's got
three hundred eighty four separate LED
backlights four millisecond response
time 99% of dobie RGB colour space
coverage 178 degree viewing angles toby
eye tracking built-in as well as quantum
dot enhancement film technology across
the front of it
holy crap that's quite a spec list of at
all quite desired desirable spec
literally is everything it is all the
cutting edge I wanna see I want it to be
32 inches and I wanted to any not $2,000
and yeah well good luck there
according to the article asus is also
working on monitor with very similar
specs probably based on the same panel
panel i don't know who makes the panel
behind this monitor uh but there you go
the new monitor for everyone to drool
over from acer will see what asus has up
their sleeves as well no price no
release date yet and bear in mind it
would take at least a couple 10 ATT is
and sli to run anything reasonable at 4k
144 Hertz so yeah but it's still there
it still means you could play at 1080 40
144 hurts or 2560 by 1440 1444 hertz on
the monitor if you wanted to yeah so you
have the flexibility to do whatever but
also even if you're not hitting 144
frames per second you got g-sync so yeah
even if you get one 112 you know right
and an loggers will last you a hell of a
lot longer than a GPU will so I mean
just you know give it a couple
generations buy the latest video card
and 4k 144 Hertz will probably be breeze
or at least a lot closer to being
possible without breaking the bank and
stuffs and I mean I've had like my same
monitor on
not the predator my other one for like
five years and I still don't really feel
the need to upgrade and stuff so yeah I
mean I don't know I think it's like you
might not be able to maximize the
potential or get the most out of it
right now but if it's going to last you
five six years you'll be able to use it
eventually to its fullest capacity I
think just graphics cards are getting so
fast and stuff I think I feel like the
2070 will be able to do what the 1080i
is doing now you know and you'll be able
to get that for Oh significantly less
yes there's one t70 yeah awkward number
that will be too if that's the
nomenclature that they go by but I would
have to imagine that's where we're
headed progress with technology
progressed amazing it's an amazing thing
yep alright moving on with hot and heavy
hardware HTC vive has a new accessory
potentially on the way this is actually
part of a what's known as HTC vive ex
accelerator program which we will be
diving into more into in more detail on
Kyle's half of the show he he basically
pulled that up and made a bunch of notes
out it without realizing that I was
going to talk about this you only talk
about this one thing I'm driving way
more right cuz Kyle's got more on this
way more nut but this is one of a few
things that HTC kind of HTC enhancements
you might call them but this is an eye
tracker that you might install into your
HTC vive they would fit in the headset
itself between your eyes and the headset
screens it doesn't seem like there's a
lot of space there but supposedly that's
what you do probably a lot smaller than
it looks in that picture yes they're
being developed by a Beijing based
company 7 in Venson 7th weird-ass night
7 invent Sun 7 in Vincent
whatever it's called a glass the lenses
are called a glass like eyeglass but
with a lowercase a instead of eye
anyway the track eye movement they're
going to open up pre-orders for the next
month in China and they're going to cost
about 220 bucks or the equivalent of 220
bucks I'm sorry
yes 220 bucks u.s. to help stop it stop
it
I hope you get to the tweak town article
soon it's holding the browser hostage uh
they'll be sold internationally in q3
2017 and yeah it's basically those two
Pai pieces goes inside the mask puts in
there to uses infrared light to track
where your your corneas are moving what
you're looking really creepy once they
implement that with like avatars because
avatars will be able to like look you in
the eye like avatars will be able to
look each other in the eyes yeah you
know what I mean because they could just
map it to whatever that's picking up yes
and it would be it would make for some
more like intimate VR social experiences
I think that's true
so look what Kyle is demonstrating a
beam is a way that then that then the
computers or whatever simulation or game
you're playing that software is a
knowledge of what your eyes are looking
at how that could help like an
interaction and a game experience and
there's other ways that that could work
too I mean you could use it to aim you
know you know that kid that kind of
thing and there's games that are out
there that use like the Tobii eye
tracker they've integrated like MSI's
integrated into some laptops and stuff
like that and just looking at the screen
it knows exactly what you're looking at
it'll move a little cursor around yeah
beyond that the article also points out
a practical use of it even if even if
you're not effectively using it in the
game it can look at what you're looking
at in in the scene and it can render
what you're looking at sharply and it
can render stuff that you're not looking
at at a lower resolution so that
performance essentially boost the
performance give you better performance
with a lower end system or be able to
run something crazy high resolution but
you know it's only really focusing on a
certain smaller part of it that you're
actually looking at so and also it's
also kind of funny like I know like
eventually this will this technology
will get cheaper but it's kind of funny
right now it's like oh you you don't
have enough money to spend on a high-end
rig that can run VR well this technology
can do it just cost $220 turns twenty
bucks
pop them in and there you go
of course it needs to be integrated in
with the software and everything like
that so so it's not like exactly plug
and play whatever yeah that's a
technique by the way of of only
rendering what you're looking
at a high resolution is called foliated
rendering fovea like that word fill v8
info vated it has a lovely faux v8 'add
causeway a fruity okay and a phobia
essences just you having a beer or
something yep
but yes moron vivexx and some of their
other cool developments on Kyle's half
of the show one last bit here for hot
and heavy hardware and that is a new
product from Razer it's a mouse model
lancehead wow this is gonna offer
tournament grade wireless performance I
don't know there's some people who won't
do wireless mouse ever Plus competitive
gaming and there's other people who do
think it's actually a good thing because
attempt so there are some benefits the
downsides to it or potential lag
interference the just the the not lack
of responsiveness or something like that
but a lot of newer ones from my
understanding I haven't objectively
tested this or anything but actually do
a much better job of that however Razer
says that the more technology is needed
especially in an environment like in a
gaming tournament or something like that
where you might have lots of wireless
interference so this Razer lancehead
hops around between different sub
frequencies within the 2.4 gigahertz
band to dodge interference Razer claims
that it outperforms every other Wireless
Gaming Mouse in lag-free performance the
article points out that logitech g930
formance wireless mouse and that in
their tests even higher interference
areas it has a net issues so who knows
this has not been again objectively
tested by me or other people writing the
article but it's got a six thousand
sixteen thousand DPI sensor it can track
at 210 inches per second can handle 50g
acceleration which is stupid and razer
mechanical mouse switches space ready
dedicated buttons for sensitivity switch
sensitivity switching a few extra
programmable buttons on there as well
which is cool looks I mean it looks very
similar to the
deathadder okay which I'm I'm cool with
yeah it's good shape I like nice very
coming very comfortable it's not exactly
the same though because it's actually
ambidextrous so that might be
interesting to any of you lefties up
there this is ambidextrous yes yes
the lancehead is no the DeathAdder is
not I know oh yeah okay that's cool so
there there's a top view but what
interesting people can't see we can
there's a top you can see I feel very
ambivalent about ambidextrous mice well
I know for lefties it can be really hard
to find Tripp the right mouse to work
with and a lot of them just end up using
the mouse with the right hand anyway
yeah okay
there's going to be a wired version of
this as well it's called the lens head
tournament edition which is stupid since
they're saying that this is it well
they're they calling the wired version
the tournament edition but they're
trying to advertise this as a tournament
writing mask whatever anyway you get
interest you get for 50 inches per
second of tracking speed with that one
the wired version is going to be 80
bucks and it's available now the
wireless version is 60 bucks more its
140 woo 80 bucks for the wired 144 the
wireless version that is such a brutal
that's such a steep I don't know price
increase anyone will justify that yeah
okay
alright let's let's move on a swordfight
we have we only have a single question
for swordfight today although we might
do a swordfight second round in Kyle's
half as part as part of Mill any more
beer
you need more beer one should you want
to help me with this uh that's your
birthday beer you keep it do you like it
yeah yeah it's tasty right first I love
IPA actually so is it the paler
you get whatever no what do you like it
it's not a true IPAs you know one cookie
like it I don't know I'm gonna over the
radio
I've got this one though hi guys my
second
sorry fight for Cal and I argue about
something what are we arguing today
today we're going to try to help you
guys out there at home especially if you
like to play the stock market game a
little bit you guys you guys into stocks
nope do you have a diversified portfolio
and all that stuff well you might be
interested to know that AMD had pretty
much their absolute worst day on the
stock market in more than a decade today
it was chaos because we gotta lose blood
there as does dachshund AMD there's
blood everywhere
this article is actually from this
morning at 9:14 a.m. so early on early
on things weren't looking good let's
check let's check real time over here on
let's refresh refresh AMD stock ticker
on Google all rights down twenty four
point three eight percent today oh my
goodness
that is a substantial amount of value to
lose with the stock now bear in mind
those of you out there who are looking
at this and saying what's going on at
AMD risin risin obviously failing this
is all the news of rising xcp you
spontaneously exploding today probably
that's that's brought this to people's
attention no that's not true that's not
true at all
no what this actually is is a hold on
let's let's see if we can look alright
so see that that's the one-year look you
might notice it climbing pretty steadily
all last year in fact it went from a
value of three points 360 360 down here
to a peak of damn it tweak town since
this the browser is frozen oh there goes
yeah all right I caught up again it was
refreshing 15 20 so it like quadrupled
ish yeah so it already went up like four
times right last year that was with all
the hype leading up to rising it gained
a huge amount of value but anyway the
point is right now all you guys were
running or playing the stock market buy
or sell we gonna buy we gonna sell we
get we need to let people who saw this
crazy day today and who are wondering
what they should do with all of their
stock market money tomorrow
because everyone's got stock market
money right totally
there what someone's gonna I always
invest in the stock and the stocks yeah
stocks are key they're good obviously I
know good to have about stocks so by
yourself um is it does our option I
picked a third option if I could but I
picked there helps and cop-out um I'm
gonna say wow I really don't know how to
argue either of these but um I don't say
sell I'll say it sell sell them cuz I
give sell think sell for for moderating
in jazz so that's I'm gonna argue for
sells processing sell processing um okay
sell the AMD party is over so I think I
think Ryan's gonna be the last the last
good thing AMD ever makes they'll never
make or top Rison anything as good as
rising ever again um and it's just gonna
right now this is this twenty four
percent drop is just a foreshadowing of
what's to come you think twenty four
percent is bad
that's just wait till it's just blood in
the water wait till next month yeah till
the blood is outside of the water to
just wait till it's all over the place
and they win the sharks arrived this one
yeah the sharks will be you know there
will be land sharks with feet um no one
will be safe all right
AMD this is this was a fluke horizon was
a fluke they'll never be this good again
this was just a flash in the pan
so to speak and you know you're gonna
lose a lot of money for you if you buy a
bunch of AMD stock right now I'm just
telling you this is an anomaly and you
should all be very careful you should
give your money you should donate it for
a good cause
like Johnny money in the chat donate
money a.m. do to us donate it to us put
your money but don't take on all your
AMD stocks all the money the oven stocks
and just dump it in to this chat right
here preferably during my heavy show
huge return on investment yep when you
donate money and chat and YouTube chat
absolutely we answer your questions
that's valuable that's true all right
your turn alright so Kyle said sell so
obviously I guess
by here everyone should buy a MD stock
tomorrow down 24% but just again if you
saw the chart
you saw me show the chart last year
Andy's on a huge upswing it's it's it's
a is it a visit bear is there BIC know
that bowl there's bulls bulls and bears
I think it's bulls cuz I know in the
game pit there's a bear and a bull
there's a bear in a bull they're both
fighting AMD is basically gonna stand to
profit from whoever wins between that
fight between the bear and the bowl and
that's pretty much how the stock market
works it's very it's kind of barbaric
actually but the point is a little dip
little dip yesterday just like because
you know when you're it's like when
you're on a trampoline right and you
bounce up really high like am did that
guy come down a little bit but on the
second bounce is going to go up even
more so I think if you buy a md stock
tomorrow you'll probably make at least a
million dollars or they'll break their
ankle on the way down and they will
never jump back up though they'll hit
the metal rim of the trampoline on their
way down and just fall off the
trampoline it's nonsense
yeah you didn't even buy the way you use
none of the of the best arguments for
your for your side
well was I supposed to say I don't know
for some reason I expected you to say
bye so I had some more I had some good
or sell for sell and what were you gonna
say
rumors of Intel about to launch X 299 is
some strong competition potentially
coming soon rumors that you I believe
are talking about on your half of the
show of Vega mega marks coming out that
are quite as as as outstanding as some
of the other writers use that but
there's also a counter-argument to that
so I feel like it cancels out okay hey
Mel even I still have high hopes for
Vega personally I didn't deep down I do
- I'm rooting for Vega I'm not listening
to that nonsense that you're gonna talk
about in your room which I never I never
used rumors to make my arguments linked
so put everyone see by Pierce and
everyone by AMD stock by 60% Oh 30% of
people say that the middle thing the
hippie the hippie garbage stop you guys
you guys a bunch of slackers not you
don't have you have no ambition
hey thank you everyone who voted in that
the straw poll of course will remain
open if you guys want to continue socks
are stupid heavy stuff fidelity fidelity
why why do you I'm not I'm definitely
not gonna do anything stock related does
is ice one did I forgot what the word
been betrayed giving you trade account
betrayed yeah okay let's move on to the
final segment which is news yes feel
like we've been talking about news news
no Kyle we've been talking about other
segments completely unrelated to news
you're right these are all real segments
this is different news sectional totally
different you're completely completely
segmented fully unique and disparate
parts of the show yep each with their
own unique charm and character is by no
means an illusion to diversify the
content of the show in any way it
provides a steady onslaught of what is
known as same and difference whereas
you're presented the information by by
Kyle and I who you know so well and that
and of course the the diversification of
bouncing between the difference
different segments sorry I'm giving away
too much about about how the show works
yeah those are our trade secrets I know
okay okay should wait tweak town article
here from Anthony Lord knows where he
got this information from ah no actually
this information is publicly available I
don't think I don't think I think
anything untoward I had to have me but
AMD has C so here's is also some good
information for why you should buy the
AMD stock ami has taken some some CPU
market share back from Intel yes yes
indeed I would scroll down to show you
this church but the browser has locked
up once again because there it is Oh cuz
we're doing tweak that such a love-hate
relationship
but I guess because its market share
yeah there's only two players on market
that's true anytime one goes up the
other one goes down so this is updated
this is this is market share by the way
based on based on past mark I believe
right
you only need one line down so this the
market share numbers here are from past
mark the freely available performance
tests you can run on your computer and
it reports to pass marks database what
what what's being run on pass mark so as
you can see a little little uptick here
q1 2017 new super nice therefore AMD
this is their first major uptick since
market share started a downward trend
back into 1 2006 so you see that see
this uptick here 2005-2006 that was the
original FX series mm-hmm that was when
AMD was like hey crushing it we were
they were like hey we should put the
memory controller on on the processor
and it tells like that's dumb and AMD's
like no we're gonna do it and it's
better and it worked in the name d's
like hey we should put more than one
core on a processor and intel's like
this stupid you stupid direct quote by
the way that's what Intel session Jimmy
named is like now we're just gonna do
that and we're gonna make chips that
kick the out of your chip out of
your pen force and it was a glorious day
it was a truly glorious time and then
when when did the F when did they
relaunch the FX he's probably right
about there wanna just got worse anyway
I'm glad they didn't try to call risin
FX again that would have really is it
yeah dangerous but right anyway Rison is
selling well and article also Anthony
Anthony's article also points out that's
early sales of Rison we're somewhat
hampered by motherboard availability the
motherboard vendors didn't have a huge
amount of time to get everything prepped
and ready to go but that has been
improving motherboard availability has
been better and so rise and sales should
continue to do well anyway more good
news
see I'm I'm trying to have a story arc
for my half of the show where it goes
from crappy stuff at the beginning to
good news at the end Micro Center cool
we all we all like micro Center as long
as you live close to one excellent place
to go and buy processors they always
have really really good deals on
processors and of course there but you
have to go in store to buy them and if
you don't live close to one that
that can be difficult of course their
their whole market strategies you go
into it for the deal on the processor
and then you get another per combo with
the motherboard and all that good stuff
but it's been working Micro Center is
saying that they are doing well in fact
their president Kevin Jones said sales
of gaming PC's have grown 25 to 30
percent year-on-year in 2016 and I'm
sorry on year in 2016 and then two
hundred and three hundred percent from a
year ago which is a which is a pretty
nice bump especially when it's a
relative I mean not small but Micro
Center is relatively small me compared
to like New Ager or Amazon for example
true he is expecting more throughout
2017 he is attributing a the except the
success to eSports and the evolution and
popularity growing popular of eSports
and games like League of Legends and
that kind of thing
he said PC gaming was considered a niche
market as recent as five years ago but
he sports has put it on the map in a big
way article goes on to point out the
March market research firm gartner
predicts that gaming PCs will grow from
six million units in 2016 to 8.7 million
yeah eight point seven million units in
2020 so continued steady growth will
account for 13% of consumer PC shipments
by that time and John petty research
earlier this year did a report showing
the PC gaming hardware jumped past the
thirty billion dollar mark for the first
time ever in 2016
Wow which is a pretty big pretty big
numbers so gaming desktop market
shrinking still because there's just
more and more people who realize they
can do stuff on smartphones and tablets
in whatever gaming PC growing yeah
that's still good and it's and it's
definitely strong enough and large
enough to maintain the the overall
desktop market because several years ago
when desktops were shrinking and there
was a bit more doom and gloom in the air
there's lots of talk like Oh Intel's
gonna abandon socketed motherboards and
all that kind of stuff I haven't heard
that much stuff about that recently and
I think it's because of the ongoing need
for more powerful computers because it's
just it's just not the same to game
on like a laptop or yeah or I mean you
can game on a laptop but I mean you
don't get quite the same level of
upgrade ability and you know repair
ability and I feel like I feel like
maybe 10 years ago most desktop towers
that were in people's homes were like
you know shitty Dell or HP pre Bilt's
and I feel like now there's hardly any
of those but if you are going to find a
desktop tower in someone's house it's
probably a gaming PC most likely yeah ok
I did have one last story on the agenda
but I think we're going to just push
that to Kyle's half because he also has
some more news on this true but
Microsoft today announced Windows 10 s
for education the new version of their
operating system which is either a
fantastic new alternative to Chrome OS
or it's devil incarnate and them trying
to recreate Windows NT or Windows RT RT
RT R it depends who you ask but again
more of that in Cos Cob of the show well
end by half by checking out some
donations yarn some questions I'm sorry
answering some questions that were
submitted via donations and we will also
do some Johnston's in just a moment
automatic Matt thank you for
consistently donating sir yes incredibly
he said sup guys always wondered how you
two met if you had to restart your
youtube lives again what would you do
differently we met a new egg yeah Bennet
new egg actually when Cal came to
interview at new egg I wasn't even there
I know I was I was out that day I was
like I don't want to go to work today so
I'm not going to go I want to hear about
whatever shitty employer about time Kyle
showed up and he interviewed and then
they like there was some they recorded
him because like he's coming in to
interview for you for potentially be on
camera and stuff the audition night and
I got to watch his interview video and I
really I really wasn't I was like no no
yeah no I guess so I can tell you why -
I had memorized the script of what I
wanted to say okay and so the first time
I did it which was probably not the
version that you saw it was flawless I
like I had everything memorized to a tee
like a play and then vu our manager at
the time was like okay I can tell you
like sort of memorized in your head
just do it off-the-cuff in your own
words and I was like
uh-uh this is a mouse it's got some
weights in it so yeah I pretty much
tanked it after that it was wholly
convinced that I didn't get the job
yeah until I guess their first pick
actually backed out at the last minute
so I was the runner-up and that's how I
got I can't remember her her name
there's a girl we interviewed she's that
she actually would have been great she
actually had some truman way better than
you I'm super better than cap not sprite
no ultimately of course things worked
out great with cow but and she she she
had like some like on camera like news
person experience and stuff like that
but she she got like a much more
legitimate job offer at the same yeah
you up for that instead anyway thanks
I'm mag Matt and good question me a
Michael Anthony $10 donation thank you
so much really enjoy about three
channels we really enjoy your donation
thanks man I'm super glad that you like
our channels to your wonderful person
Robert Davis $5 donation thanks Robert
honk I'll need an SSD to store my video
games on what do you guys recommend
sorry for my poor use of the English
language your English is perfect no need
to apologize honestly when it comes to
SSDs if you're looking at SATA there's
not a huge difference most of the SATA
drives if you get it from a reputable
manufacturer a data Patriot I mean heck
like ZOTAC Samsung Samsung of course a
Corsair who else makes SSDs Seagate used
to they kind of stopped crucial crucial
SanDisk SanDisk ocz Toshiba
like all of these companies make pretty
good SSDs and even like the more
inexpensive the kind of slightly less
expensive SSDs like like you can get a I
haven't looked at prices recently but
you should be a silicon power it was a
cheap brand yeah you should be able to
get a 250 gig ish SSD I feel like for 80
or 90 bucks unless prices are you keep
going it yeah under 100 yeah and yeah
most of them are pretty decent paying
more for the higher end ones unless
you're really doing some specific work
with it you're not going to get a huge
benefit from that so yeah yep okay thank
you
beyond ellis beck $5 donation why isn't
the are
if your ex FPS better at 1080p gaming
even though it's hardware is just as
powerful as a GTX 1080 is its Tess
Pollock polygon wraps to blame what do
you mean just as powerful as a 1080 yeah
it's not true I don't think just as
powerful as a 1080 would be examined if
on target X if you're comparing for
example stream processors that AMD lists
with like CUDA cores and Nvidia lists
those are not directly comp compare
right it might have a few specs in
common but that doesn't constitute how
it performs overall there's a bunch of
factors to consider and even like that
the die shrink is a bit smaller on the
1080p Orford I'm sorry the GTX 1080 I
would recommend you watch a video on
gamers Nexus and wearing their shirt
today I might as well represent like one
of their videos it's within the past
week or week and a half it's an
interview with Scott Watson oh yeah it's
good when they discuss why an NVIDIA GPU
running at 1850 mega Hertz compared to
an AMD GPU running at 1,400 megahertz to
slow it might still have the same
performance or slower or that kind of
thing they do a much better job of
explaining that that we can do right now
but thank you for your donation Khoda
commend our donation he is why your
suggestion for a camera will be used
about 50% of the time for stills 50% of
the time for 1080p 60 video looking at
DSLR mirrorless from 800 to $1,500 for
the body gh4
is good not the gh4 the g h5 no it's a
GH when the Joker has yeah he has the
slightly it's a it's like the gh4 more
entry-level one but it's four or five
hundred bucks less and it can still do
most the same thing it has a say it has
the same sensor I can't remember
it's from Panasonic Panasonic Lumix
something that's cheaper than the gh4 I
would also suggest the if you're only
doing 1080p 60 video oh wait no g7 is it
did you say I was going to say the 70d
from from Canon but I think that only
just 1080p 30 correctly from wrong chat
but that's a really good camera with
awesome autofocus I know I know I mean
85 g85 g85 yeah okay so thank you cell
I'm putting on panasonic g80
five is what I would suggest granted
that is heavily due to the fact that
I've been using a gh4 and now the GH
five for quite a while and I really like
it I'm very comfortable with it I don't
can't say I've had a bunch of experience
like the Sony cameras or Canon
alternatives to say yes get that instead
that's just something that I know would
probably do a pretty good job for you Oh
yep Hey I concur and questions go Luke f
five dollar donation will you guys be
joining floatplane club when lmg opens
it up to other Creators no Kyle I'm not
Luke left forever forever Fri uh yes um
it's something that I would consider
it's definitely something that's not
something that I'm ruling out at this
point I think more details need to come
to light and need to have a sit-down
talk with the lmg crew about exactly
what it entails but I could see
potentially being a good platform for
creators and viewers alike
I know Linus has talked to us yeah um
actually at the one of the AMD press
conferences not too long ago and he was
explaining sort of how it would all
operate and it sounded good it's he gave
a good pitch yeah Linus is definitely a
good businessman for sure so I'm not
gonna rule it out at this point I think
it's definitely possible
um and more details will determine
whether or not it's something that I'm
on board for I think if it's something
that we can do in tandem with YouTube
with minimal additional effort with Xero
uh like licensing or anything like
signed over to Linus which I don't think
he would do no of course you know
obviously but as long as like in the
contract you know like you know simple
basic stuff like Brandon shoots on my
b-roll you know it's all edits my videos
I think it really work out it's a mutual
beneficial Luke is available to run
benchmarks and absolutely you know
simple things okay thanks Luke
pup Shepard five dollar donation I think
the next nvidia name would be eleven
hundred series not 2000 series since as
such as the eleven ninety 1180 eleven
seventy potentially very very much that
you could be right the eleven ninety
bubbles off the tongue vessel pup has
two hundred sixty-four subs subs now
congratulations pop I don't know III
really don't care either way I mean just
if I had to pick like eleven hundred
does roll off the tongue easier running
seventy
eleven seventy sounds a little bit
better than twenty seventy because it
rhymes it rhymes
what definitely looks like a bigger a
bigger number which might appeal more to
NVIDIA marketing but Hoonah true Aries
seventy-eight five dollar donation thank
you so much great show guys I am
building a new rising system wanted to
know if I could reuse my coarser h80
I how long do these coolers usually last
uh reuse it as long as it's the same
stock yeah like a like a closed-loop
cooler
i I mean after it gets passed maybe the
three-year mark I might start to I mean
justjust listen to it most most I'll
make your stamps yet listen to a
chequered temps if something's gonna die
it's probably gonna be the pump and
often the pump will make a nasty noise
or some kind of weird sound that you
don't recognize if it's different before
it does so keep your ear on that and
definitely have some kind of active
temperature monitor running because if
your pump does die that's actually one
of the I had a big problem with pump
dying because it died I didn't realize
that it died my CPU is overheating and
automatically shutting down my system
and it did that during system boot-up
and corrupted my raid yeah and I
reiterate I remember that screwed me up
sucks but all that said yes it's
probably just fine
you will need to get an updated bracket
for it to fit and for unless you're
using the crosshair six hero so yeah but
of course there should should send you
that if you ask important there's
somebody's got Matthew hunt for the ten
dollar donation hello so matenda 1068
that is Canadian Canadian yes of course
that's from not a real country
hello Paulin Kyle they love the show
always looking forward to your videos
wanting to get into some photography any
recommendations for a solid starter
camera in the fourth four hundred us
range have a beer on me or one hundred
four hundred um geez gosh I'm so blank
on that and still making there like the
rebel Ti series I know they that's like
an older camera but DSLR under five
hundred dollars you could just google it
if you can find a sub five hundred DSLR
that can shoot 1080p 30 yeah you
probably get better image quality of
that because DSLRs will have larger
sensors Canon Rebel sl1 is five hundred
dollars if you're looking closer to 400
Canon Rebel t5 that is 389 with an 18 to
55 millimeter kit lens yeah that's what
I that's how I go go for though because
the dedicated video cameras or
camcorders usually much have much
smaller sensors they might have better
features for video and more useful and
convenient features for video but image
quality wise who get you'll do better
with a DSLR need thank you for your
donation

hey Ryan Ryan Pegg low windows no
comments 20 bucks here you go thank you
very much sir zing gaucho got over a $10
donation looking to do a raid of two
SSDs and I was wondering if you think
Windows storage spaces would be better
or if using my RAID controller in my
Asus x99 deluxe would be better
I've never used what's Windows storage
spaces Windows storage spaces I believe
can take multiple drives and aggregate
them to look like a single Drive that
kind of thing I've never yet added
removed drives to I think I've never
used today okay I would just read it
just because it's what I'm familiar with
but who knows hey if you want
performance to use the RAID controller
you're probably better performance that
way also I want to say is it zinc also
that end of the house martell I for some
reason okay Jeremy Jeremy Clayton $10
since I generated 10 bucks to Kyle last
week here's a tenner for you Paul
I guess more to the evaluation of my PC
in Kyle's half unless you forgot I will

five bucks from Eric Eric yellow jelly
jelly Eric
have either of you attempted to use nvme
m dot two drives in a written raid for
video editing and if so how was it
no I've not attempted that yet only used
a single nvme Drive at this point yeah
um
there is a location though a bandwidth
mission and huge bandwidth yeah
bandwidth limitation if you try to do it
on like Z 270 you need to do something
like that on X 99 yeah right now to have
enough direct PCIe lanes to actually
take admit to actually use the drives at
full speed but no I have not set that up
yet although I do have a serious set of
nvme drives and I've been saving them up
to do a video on comparing them but
that's been really busy
