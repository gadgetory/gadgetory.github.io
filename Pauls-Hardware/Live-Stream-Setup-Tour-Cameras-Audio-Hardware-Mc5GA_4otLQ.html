welcome to Paul's hardware today's video
is a little bit of a behind-the-scenes
look at how I set up to shoot live
streams so I'm going to be looking at a
lot of the hardware and configuration
stuff that you see behind me going over
some of the cameras that I have set up
my audio solution and especially a focus
on how I shoot myself
because I'm usually a one-man operation
so oftentimes after kind of get things
all arranged for myself to hit the
record button and then record myself and
then I have myself later on so sometimes
it's a matter of being able to monitor
myself like I'm doing right now with the
camera that I'm using which is the
Panasonic Lumix LX
run-and-gun shooting camera has some
limitations but definitely nice that it
has this Panasonic image app which
allows me to see exactly what the heck
is going on that's one of the most
important things when you're shooting
yourself it's just being able to look at
it and be like yes it looks okay I hope
because one of the last things you ever
want to do one of the things I really
try to avoid is having to reshoot
something having to go back because it
was out of focus or maybe because we
lost audio or the audio didn't pick up
well enough and as I talked about all
this stuff I'm reminded that I'm
recording using an in-camera microphone
and it's probably really echoey but
we'll deal with that anyway um also what
the heck is this thing right here I'm
going to show you right now so since I
started with cameras I'm going to go for
the rest of the ones that I'm currently
using starting with my main one right
here which is the Panasonic Lumix gh4
actually as this Olympics anyway it's a
gh4 from Panasonic I love love love this
camera I got it about it partially
slightly used from Larry Dickerson aka
geeky nerd dad follow him on Twitter and
YouTube and stuff and some things that I
really like about this camera apart from
the ability to shoot 4k interchangeable
lenses nice large Micro Four Thirds
sensor it's got a flip-out and
articulating screen which means that I
can open the screen and I can actually
if it's not being blocked by cables turn
it around and face it towards me as I'm
recording stuff that way if I'm studying
for shot I can look and immediately see
what it is now in the absence of that in
for instance when the in the
configuration you see right now it has
my big ghetto teleprompter in front of
it I can't see this through the
cardboard so that's when I would line up
and use my smartphone like I just showed
you a second ago with the image app and
then that would allow me to actually see
what's going on here so I can monitor it
even if I'm a waif or not looking at it
directly the other way that I can
monitor it is of course if I'm actually
live-streaming or setting up to
livestream which would be via the HDMI
out which is right over here kind of so
that's plugged in and that's routed all
the way over via cable on the floor to
my computer's capture card right there
which is a Blackmagic intensity Pro you
can find lots of pros and cons for the
intensity Pro online lots of people have
tried it with varying degrees of success
but it's actually worked pretty well for
me so anyway there's kind of my main
camera that I use when I need a
secondary camera I use the LX 100
although the Alex 100 that I'm recording
this right now does not necessarily have
everything you need to use it for for a
main camera the LX 100 doesn't have an
HDMI out clean HDMI out it does have an
HDMI out but you can only use it for
playback it's actually pretty stupid
I feel like Panasonic could bypass that
if they really wanted to but anyway I'm
getting off topic so the Alex 100 I
order a package stuff live is a webcam
so this is a Logitech c920 it's kind of
a I don't want to call it the gold
standard in webcams visual quality is
pretty good with this and the software
is not terrible either
so you can kind of get by you got to
figure out some of the quirks wait did I
say the software is not terrible the
software is pretty bad but once you've
kind of figure out some of the quirks
you can use this and set it up and I use
this just to record directly to the
computer when when needed or I will also
use this actually to set up and do time
lapses and I think that deserves another
video if I want to show you guys how to
do webcam time lapses because it would
be too complicated for this but anyway
that's kind of what I do when I'm
recording and there's a look at my view
when I'm recording can also see our
washer and dryer in the background but
all right let's move on from cameras now
and I want to talk a little bit about
audio so let's talk about where I'm on
my audio comes from all my audio gets
piped through this little guy right here
this is a monoprice sound Pro audio
series sound board is just a mixer
the product ID is 6 1 5 808 if you guys
are interested there's actually a newer
version of this it's a little bit
cheaper on a price which is I believe a
10 channel mixer this is an 8 channel
mixer but it has four XLR inputs that
are powered with phantom power so the
newer one you can get is a little bit
cheaper than this and I believe that's a
10 channel but it's only got two powered
XLR inputs this one is four so it's a
little bit more expensive I think this
is like 80 bucks or maybe 90 bucks the
newer one I'll put a link in the
description and that one's like I think
that one's like 60 bucks or so but again
click link in the description if you
really want to find out anyway what this
allows me to do is take multiple mic
inputs so I've got two mics going into
it right now and that will allow me to
do multi person setups so for instance
when Cal and I do our livestream show
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific on twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware we can record ourselves now
here in my garage studio we are using
these microphones which are also from
monoprice and they're the mono price
large diaphragm condenser microphone I
believe is what they're called the
product ID and these guys is six hundred
eight hundred you gotta check those out
and we've been getting some fight now
that we finally figured out how to
actually like configure these we've
actually been getting like some positive
comments on audio which is nice these
are ideally placed very close to you
which is why I have them attached to
these kind of swing arms up here the sir
these are super ghetto swing arms
they're like 15 bucks on on Amazon which
is why they are being held up with extra
ropes and stuff speaking of extra ropes
and stuff I have this sort of overhead
ceiling framework that I built up here
as well as a ghetto mounted light that's
providing a little bit of light the
reason I built this out of wood is to
make it malleable and flexible and to
allow me to do things like add a little
drop down piece so that I can bring the
mics closer to our faces and stuff like
that also too I have this little guy in
here which is just a c-clamp mounted
with another camera although this camera
is nice because it can do HDMI out it's
just a camcorder but this allows me to
get like a top-down view of just
whatever the heck is going down here on
the table then it allows me to like
switch back and forth between it and
that kind of stuff last thing to mention
for
Audio and for this recorder is that
since I already showed you those mics
those are plugged in via XLR right here
when I bring this over to Kyle's and we
livestream from there I use these which
are little lav mics just wired and they
plug in same way works the same way I
like the sound quality of the large
diaphragm condenser microphones better
but it's nice to be able to drop in
those those lav mics whenever necessary
last thing is that it's got a couple
different ways of connecting so there's
actually USB out on this side over here
so we can just plug that straight into
the streaming system and then just
connect via a standard USB device no
drivers required or anything like that
or I can use the outputs right here the
aux sender the headphone out and that I
can pipe right into the camera
so if I'm not streaming if I'm just
recording locally onto the camera I can
do that
into the camera then I don't have to
sync up the sound later on or that kind
of thing a couple of the things before I
move on if you're in the market for a
camera again make sure it's got that
articulating screen or some way of
actually being able to see yourself
especially if you're recording yourself
make sure it has a discreet audio input
usually via a 1/8 inch Jack having a
separate audio input is really really
key if you don't want to record sound
separately and sync it up later which
can just kind of be a pain in the butt
its way it's way easier just to record
locally and then the last thing is to
make sure you have AC power
this is especially if you're streaming
so this I have a little power battery
pack unit so it just pops in there and
then it little wire feeds out and then I
can actually feed full time power to
this via just a little 15 dollar battery
pack that I got again I think on Amazon
this works great and I have had the
camera running for like literally hours
and with the AC power and it just works
and it stays on and it always feeds the
HTM out and it's good to go
now this device in front of the camera
is my ghetto teleprompter it's been
through a couple different variations it
is made of a cardboard box and a piece
of glass this is me being frugal or just
deciding hey a teleprompter is really
just a glorified angled piece of glass I
don't want to pay 100 or 150 or 200
bucks for the ones that they sell
although honestly those are nice and in
retrospect maybe I should have just done
that but this is basically cardboard box
reinforced with some duct tape I made
black I got black duct tape to make it
fancier and I also added a metal or this
is just a unlike a straight
hanger that goes across the top to hold
this little cross beam up and that holds
the glass in place the glass reflects
down onto a monitor screen this was
really really cheap to put together
because the glass was like you know two
or three dollars and it's cardboard and
duct tape that is assuming that you have
some of the other stuff you need though
so I did have an older monitor it's like
lower resolution than 1080 so I don't
really use it much anymore but I popped
it on here for this and then that
actually goes over and connects up to my
laptop right here I can also connect it
to the streaming system if I need to and
then I use some software called mirrors
mirror script Pro which is totally free
and it works
so that's Merri script Pro I just get
whatever text or script or whatever or
usually like if I'm live streaming I
just put some notes on there to kind of
keep me on track and keep things
organized you hit start and then you can
flip it on screen or whatever and then
it's just being mirrored onto this over
here and then as you can maybe see it's
it shows up right there and then if I
want to control it I have a USB
connected a keyboard it senses it this
is a Coolermaster keyboard you don't
need to use a high-end mechanical
keyboard for this I just happened to
have too many of these lying around
apparently and then I usually I usually
wear like socks or something and then I
hit the spacebar with my toe and that's
how I control the words going up and
down or just to pause them if I want to
go off on a tangent or something like
that and it actually works really well
even to the extent that I like prefer
this setup over some of the other
teleprompter setups I've seen
specifically because it allows you to
change like the software allows you to
change the size of the words on screen
like bring the margins in if you want to
and just kind of configure it so that it
gives you the best best way to go you
can also use the buttons here to like
slow down or speed up the text which is
also pretty key to kind of help you
speak in a regular cadence or that kind
of thing and this is all honestly guys
you know I don't know if you guys are
into teleprompters or if you think they
they're fake or whatever but really it's
there so that you can kind of keep up
with what you want to talk about so that
you don't get too distracted like I'm
probably doing in this video and going
off on tangents and to keep
things concise and to cut way down on
the editing time because if you have a
bunch of random tangents and you edit
them all out then that takes longer okay
so I talked about cameras
I've talked about my audio solution at
least for right now and I've talked
about my teleprompter how about this
whole live-streaming thing well that's
handled by this system over here which
is the streaming system I also have
another system over here which you guys
might recognize that is arctic panther
oh that was my it so I don't have to
edit inner growl later as a pretty
terrible grill anyway my my goal here
for streaming is that I need to be able
to play games on this system because
this is my good system dual nine 80s and
whatnot water-cooled that's connected
just to a 1080 monitor right now but I
also have a pass-through going so this
comes over here and it feeds to this guy
this is the Elgato gamer HD 60 so this
has a HDMI pass-through and then a USB
out the USB out goes over to the actual
streaming system here and that way I can
actually capture on to the reaming
system also is a glossy monitor so you
can see me in the reflection high so I'm
going to show you guys a pretty basic
setup that I have for capturing that GTA
5 over there and streaming it with this
system I bear in mind and most with most
computers like you don't necessarily
need a separate computer to play the
game and then a separate computer to
stream it I only have this setup because
I like having a dedicated computer to
stream on or at least that the handles
streaming is kind of its primary tasks
because that means it's doesn't get
moved around or messed around with their
settings changed your equipment swap bed
or anything like that very often for a
streaming system you'll definitely need
a capture card of some kind so I have to
the internal Blackmagic intensity Pro
that you can see right there and then
the external Elgato Game Capture HD
which is like right over there that's
the external USB one I also even kind of
like having those separate having those
be separate devices so it's easier to
tell which one is which in this in in
like the system as you're doing
selections and that kind of thing and
they seem to play nice together so far
if I have a complaint about the game
capture hd60 it is that there is some
lag and delay because it actually does a
little bit of buffering inside the
device so you might notice right now
I've got GTA v up there then over on the
system I'm just going to load up OBS for
dreaming software I like OBS because
it's free and I also use xsplit I have a
license for that
I think exploits a little bit more
full-featured and the UI is a little bit
friendlier but you can do most of the
stuff that you would do in xsplit using
OBS and I'm apologize if you guys have a
hard time seeing this at all
okay so just real quick to show you a
basic captioning I'm going to hit
preview and that actually made the
screen go dark here for a second because
that started up the buffering in the
elgato game capture hd60 but after a
second it streams and then what you see
over here is now shown right over here
from there I could go on and do other
things like setting up the camera and
dropping in there this isn't necessarily
going to be a software tutorial on this
although guys let me know if you are
interested in a software tutorial from
me I'm still learning every day about
how you how to use the streaming
software so it would be you know it'd be
that kind of video but this gives me the
basic functionality of playing the game
over here on my nice epic water-cooled
system with dual nine 80s still getting
most of the performance granted I'm
limited to 1080 60 but if I'm streaming
anyway then I'm probably to do that
anyway I might get a new monitor over
here it's something higher than 1080 and
that might help things a little bit or
at least make a little bit better use of
those dual dual nine eighties there
beyond that though you have other let me
see what else I have set up here oh
there's me so I switched over to this
other scene and now you can see me
that's that's the camera recording
straight from the gh4 over there and now
you can see me on screen with my Alex
100 and then of course we can use the
software if we wanted to like edit this
around or that kind of thing we have to
select this and hit edit and then you
know you can you can resize stuff and
move stuff around and all that kind of
stuff so guys that is a kind of a
rundown of the hardware I'm using right
now the systems I'm using right now I
know there wasn't a whole lot of delving
into detail but I didn't want to make
this video too long let me know in the
comments if you want to see more videos
like this and how I have it set up this
is obviously will hopefully obviously
also a work in progress I have some
painting to do and back here and other
projects that are ongoing so stuffs
still ready to be moved around here
