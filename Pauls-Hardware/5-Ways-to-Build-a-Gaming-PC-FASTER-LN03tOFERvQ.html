anything anymore I'm surprised you have
time to watch this video for instance
but because I respect your time I'm
going to keep this short and to the
point
building a computer is fun and rewarding
but it takes time that you do not have
so how can you enjoy the fruits of DIY
PC building and still have some time
left in the day to get some gaming in
pet your dog and maybe acknowledge the
existence of your family follow these
five tips to help you build a computer
faster I will be listing these in order
from most time saved to least time saved
so tip number one is skip the RGB
lighting for the past couple years PC
RGB lighting has grown in popularity as
well as complexity and I have thought I
was just about done with many a build in
that time frame only to find that I
needed to spend another hour plus
working out how the lighting would plug
in with RGB fans motherboards LED strips
CPU coolers graphics cards SLI bridges
memory and even SSDs and power supplies
there are a lot of potential pieces of
hardware to plug in and then there's how
it plugs in whether it's directly to the
motherboard to a standalone controller
or to a USB connected hub that needs to
be managed with system software add the
confusion of addressable and non
addressable LED types with very similar
looking plugs and multiple methods of
software control that can often overlap
with each other and you can see why
skipping the RGB can save a lot of time
and make it a lot easier to sleep next
to your PC without a laser light show
going on as well tip 2 is to skip the a
IO or all-in-one liquid CPU cooler this
rule extends to many aftermarket CPU air
coolers as well and prior to the advent
of RGB this would have been my number
one recommendation to save time with a
build in fact here's where I get to do
something that I almost never do
recommend a stock Intel CPU heatsink fan
these oft maligned coolers might not
actually cool that well and maybe they
get loud over time but in my opinion the
ease and speed of installation just
can't be beat we have pre applied
thermal paste we have four push plugs to
secure it and you're done AMD's cpu
cooler mount would come in second in
this race but stock am floor coolers
actually require the removal of two
brackets in order to install it properly
which slows things down and then you
have to secure it with a screw driver
secure yes but so much wasted time the
biggest time sucked beyond RGB lighting
though is aftermarket coolers in general
with their specialized back plates
you need to install and often confusing
installation procedures that vary from
cooler to cooler and a iOS would
definitely come in last because after
you mount the CPU block to the
motherboard well then you gotta also
mount the radiator and the fans to the
case just a big waste of time
now the next three tips on my list save
way less time than those first two so
let me know in the comments section if
you guys can think of anything better
that would save more time than this but
tip 3 is a newer feature that you can
take advantage of a fixed motherboard IO
shield I think this is a great feature
that's appearing on more and more
motherboards these days and while
typical IO shield installation is
usually pretty quick it can be fiddly
especially with cheaper flimsy metal
shields that are prone to cutting you as
well also this is often an overlooked
part of the build process entirely and
if you forgot to install your IO shield
fixing the issue requires removing your
motherboard you might as well just build
your entire computer all over in that
case fixed IO shields are read my fourth
tip deals with those pesky tiny and
easily mismatched front panel connectors
for power reset and the corresponding
LEDs I have two possible ways to
streamline this procedure and the first
one is just to skip it completely it's
easy to get by without a reset button
we've already established that LED
lights are an acceptable casualty on the
road to PC building efficiency so all
you really need is that power button so
grab a motherboard with a surface
mounted power button you'll often get a
reset button alongside it as well and
then just leave the side panel off of
your case hey that saves even more time
in your build you could also go for an
open design case like a thermaltake core
p1 that lets you just reach inside to
push the button if you can't live
without your side panel though consider
just plugging in that power plug
connection that's 75% less pins to plug
in than plugging in all of them my final
tip involves connecting up your storage
drives and here we can save even more
time by going with MDOT to SSDs I list
this last because there's a little bit
of give and take here while MDOT two
SSDs simply plug directly into your
motherboard skipping the laborious tasks
that you have to go through a standard
2.5 inch drives connecting it SATA data
cable from the motherboard to the drive
and a SATA power cable from the power
supply there is the possibility of delay
because of the stupidly tiny screws and
standoffs that MDOT two drives use just
remember that these little guys usually
come with the motherboard accessories in
a tiny bag and they don't need to be
tightened super tight just enough to
hold the m-dot to drive securely another
thing to consider though is that many
motherboard
have MDOT to heatsinks which aren't
really necessary except for the fastest
drives and heavy use case scenarios so
for that you're either gonna want to
take a moment to mount that heatsink
which will take a little bit more time
or you can just opt to go without it or
just choose a motherboard with an MDOT
to slot that doesn't have a heatsink and
then you won't have to worry about it at
all if you've already got a 2.5 inch SSD
and you don't want to upgrade to an MDOT
to drive then there's one other thing
you can do and that is just not worry
about mounting this to your case once
you have the data and power plugged in
you can really just have an SSD floating
anywhere in your case and you don't have
to worry about mounting it down there's
no moving parts and they don't get warm
enough to need active cooling for the
most part either so save some time there
too so there you have it guys those are
my five methods to shave precious
seconds off of your PC build that can be
reapplied elsewhere in your life I like
to use my bank two seconds and minutes
to actually play video games on the
computers that I build although I
probably more often use them to just
sleep and that's often involuntary but
that's because I game late at night I'm
getting sidetracked of course there are
many other ways to min/max your time
while PC buildings so let me know in the
comment section down below if you guys
have any other further tips or shortcuts
to share with the PC building community
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and if I've saved you a few
seconds you could maybe use it to hit
the thumbs up button on your way out
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
