probing Paul this is episode number 30
this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A where i answer
tech questions or random questions or
what have you I've been doing this for
quite some time now look this is the
thirtieth episode there's a look back at
the probing Paul Bley lists so if you
want to go back and look at other
questions I have responded to feel free
to do so today I have some questions
that were posted in last month's video
so leave questions down in the comments
section below if you want me to
potentially answer them in next month's
December episode but for now let us
begin with the first question this is
from Sawyer he asks why our monitor
names always so long and hard to
remember so let's double check Sawyer
and we're looking at new AG and check
what some typical monitor names are the
del se two-to-one 6hv that's catchy
the HPV for g-46 a 8 a sir EDC
oh this has a series the Edie series
Edie 3 2 2 Q now this is applying two
monitors here but we can actually apply
this to pretty much the whole wide range
of PC components that you could
potentially buy now here is an actual
monitor that does have a brand name the
asus rog swift because asus is done
licensing for these brands rog republic
of gamers is a brand that they own swift
is a series of monitors that they
specifically went through the process to
create a brand for pay for the licensing
I don't know the details that go into
that but I know it's an additional
process so the short answer is money it
costs more money to go through the
branding process to create a brand it's
just a word instead of a string of
letters and numbers the cost involved
the cost of keeping up with that brand
and making sure you protect it out in
the wild and then also you have to bear
in mind that when it comes to computers
there's lots of smaller companies that
develop and manufacture the parts that
go inside and those companies aren't
always large enough to absorb the cost
that goes into a branding initiative so
they stick with letters and numbers so
that they can sell you the products at a
minimal margin and keep the price low so
that they can be more competitive in
that way and apparently this has been a
financially reasonable solution for a
lot of manufacturers when it comes to
the wide range of products that they
bring to market because it doesn't seem
to be going away anytime soon next
question here is from Cory W who says
Paul would you suggest buying a second
1070 TI for an SLI setup or buying a
single 1080 TI for 1440p gaming and
fresh Street I like your resolution sir
I like that you're playing on a high
refresh rate and a 1070 a 1070 TI is a
perfectly adequate card for that that
said if you're looking for more frames
SLI is a potential solution but I would
recommend that you opt with going for a
single faster card rather than adding
another 1070 TI to your setup however
you should reality check and to that end
I have linked a review by babel tech
reviews in this video's description
which is a 50-game gtx 1070 TI sli
review this is from back in January so
it's a little bit dated but this should
give you a better idea of the wide
variety of games and the performance you
should expect they tested at 1080 1440
and 2160 and over on the right side here
in the yellow column you can see the
percentage increase in performance they
got or in some cases negative
performance or in some cases just like
practically nothing 1.6% 23.1% this is
why we usually recommend people go with
the single card versus two card is
because there's simply a wide variance
in the performance you would expect to
see that said if you happen to be a huge
fan of like three or four games in
particular and you look at this chart
and you're like wow they all scale
really well with SLI then maybe that is
a good solution for you so generally
speaking I would say no opt for the
fastest single card you can get rather
than going with an SLI setup but in some
specific scenarios if you can see the
game that you want to play most and you
can see the performance increase is
there in that game then I would actually
say go for it in that situation
next question from zip zo lock I am
surprised no one has ever asked this but
do laptops have a UEFI menu like desktop
motherboards do during system boot up on
laptop I've never seen it's a press a
certain key to enter your BIOS and this
will vary pretty significantly actually
from laptop manufacturer to laptop
manufacturer laptop manufacturers often
produce their own motherboards but they
do all have some means of accessing a
pre boot environment UEFI typically and
you can often access that by pressing a
key on startup I've seen a bunch of
different varieties on it whether you're
talking about like an Acer or an Asus or
a think pad or something like that they
all have different means you can usually
check your manufacturer guide info like
they might have a PDF guide that you can
download from the website or
documentation that came with a laptop in
order to tell you the specific means for
your specific
laptop of doing that it's harder because
laptops are usually a lot less amenable
to stuff like overclocking or changing
settings in there but it can often be
useful if you can't find your
documentation or if you just want an
easier way check out the video I posted
just last week about the best way to
access your bass or UEFI just hold the
shift button while you go click restart
and that will allow you to access the
advanced startup menu and from here you
can just tell it to go ahead and boot to
the UEFI firmware settings which will
automatically restart the laptop and
boot into that environment and then you
can play around your I don't know why
you want to access that but there are
reasons why you might want to I guess
I'll leave that to your discretion next
question here from Jamie do youdo
Ghaderi
I'm sorry I'm probably mispronouncing
that but I did my best but he says hey
Paul is it safe to use a blower on a
vacuum cleaner to clean off the dust
from computer components such as
motherboards and laptops and then by the
way thank you for making the videos
you're very welcome and thank you for
the question the answer is yes but you
should be very careful there's a couple
of reasons why you might not want to use
a vacuum one is that some vacuums
especially if you're in a very dry and
static rich environments can actually
move so much air especially again if
it's dry hot air that it can develop
static charges that can potentially
discharge in damaged components that's a
real rare scenario I haven't seen that
actually happen personally it's just
something I've been warned about in the
past the other thing I warn you about is
if you have case fans or system fans or
CPU fans any fans that are inside the
system
fans like these have a maximum rpm rate
and if you blast a bunch of high-speed
air through them with a vacuum or a
blower or something you can actually
over rotate them to the point where the
engine or the motor inside is damaged
and you don't want to do that you can of
course prevent that by simply doing
something to keep the fan blades from
spinning as you blow the air onto them
or if you are cleaning out computers
often you might consider investing in
something like a datavac I don't have
one of these personally but Cal has one
and he swears by it it's about 70 bucks
on Amazon so I'll link this in the
description but beyond that yes you can
use a vacuum just again be careful of
those two potential situations that can
occur oh I would say one other thing if
you have a vacuum on suck mode and it's
a very strong vacuum there are
situations where you can actually suck
components off of a PCB so I would be
very careful about going right up
against something like that to because
they're not really me
to withstand that level of pressure
positive or negative
next question from site Punk to15 hey
Paul I understand a lot of PC builders
like to show off their gear with the
side panel window while hiding the cable
clutter on the other side of the case
but lately everyone seems to be mounting
their SSDs on the hidden side are we
ashamed of the SSDs are they more ugly
than closed loop coolers and how do you
choose which components you want to show
off and what you don't
I've had this situation happen to myself
several times because I'll build a
system and oftentimes if it's got a
power supply shroud it might have SSD
mounts on the top of it and it's a very
nice location to drop an SSD or you
might have a situation like I have with
this SL 600 n that has mounts right here
for SSDs with plugs that you put on the
back but where the actual connector is
is a factor here this connector is
actually on the right side with the
Samsung Drive so if I mounted it there
the wires would be coming out on the
rights but the SanDisk drive I had was
actually printed the other way so if I
put it that way the writing would have
been upside-down and that was enough for
me to not want to put it there because I
didn't want the cables coming out on
this side and I don't want the writing
upside down if I have to flip it so
because of that I moved it to the rear
mount so that said the way I decide
whether I'm going to display a product
in a build prominently so that people
can see it through a side panel is
usually just how it looks and how it
matches with the rest of the system this
is a Seagate 600 Pro which you can't get
any more they discontinued them but this
has like a pretty standard metal surface
and this I might remove the label from
and have in a prominent position if this
sort of metal finished matched with the
aesthetic of the rest of my build this
Toshiba TR 200 we have done some ads for
and it's a very solid performing drive
itself I don't like the sticker on here
that much I mean if you're going with
the green gray and black build and maybe
it matches but anything else you'd
probably want to remove that beyond that
though it does have sort of a textured
finish so that's not too bad either but
a lot of these are just housings the
actual SSD inside is fairly small so
it's up to the SSD manufacturer whether
or not they want to make something that
has sort of a cleaner finish like the
Samsung 850 Evo here pretty color
neutral you could put this wherever and
then anyone looking at your system who
knows about SSDs or whatever be like oh
that's a nice assist e or you can go
completely the aesthetic side and have
something like these team group SSDs
which have RGB LEDs in
to them which you may love or may hate
depending on your love of aesthetics
with computers and whether or not you
have RGB LEDs but these it would be a
travesty to purchase and then not place
somewhere that were somewhat visible so
you have a wide range of SSDs and I
think what I like most about SSDs is
just they're very flexible since they're
small and thin and even if you don't
have an amount somewhere you can just
get some velcro adhesive strips and put
them on the back and then stick it
wherever you want so SSDs they're super
convenient
next question from George Noren and this
is a longer one so I'm going to try to
paraphrase but he has a rise in 2700 and
as rack x4 70 Taichi motherboard with 2
m dot 2 slots one is Gen 3 by 4 and one
is Gen 2 by 4 which has significantly
less bandwidth he has a WD nvme 500 gig
storage drive and he's just asking about
that second slots he's looking
specifically for Gen 2 by 4 SSDs but
they're very expensive and he's just
asking what the difference is between
those 2 slots and if it really is that
significantly worse if you were to drop
an SSD into it I'll link you to a tweak
town review this is a by my boy Steve
over there so he always does a great job
with those but you can find of course
pictures on here and this is where I was
just doing some double-checking
beforehand about the MDOT 2 slots this
is the lower MDOT 2 slot and it shares
bandwidth with this PCI Express slot
which is wired up you can kind of see
here 4 by 4 so the PCI Express Gen 2 by
4 band width of this PCIe slot will be
diverted over to the m dot 2 slot if
that is what you decide to populate now
there's different ways of setting up a
motherboard in different ways of wiring
things and you have PCI Express Lanes
that come directly from the CPU and then
you also have a chipset which has a
peripheral controller hub and that has
more PCIe lanes allocated to it and it
essentially acts as a switch I can't say
this for absolute sure because I haven't
looked at the actual block diagram of
this motherboard but I'm pretty
confident that the PCIe Gen 2 by 4
connection from this motherboard is
coming from the PCH from the chipset
rather than directly from the CPU that
means that you might suffer from a
little bit of latency problems with this
but then of course you also have the
issue that it is PCIe gen - rather than
gen 3 and you can also check out the PCI
Express page and Wikipedia which I'll
also link in the description if you want
to check that out it goes over lots of
stuff like the pin outs and everything
like that
I want to scroll down to this chart
right here because we can see the actual
bandwidth that's available with PCI
Express you have theoretical throughput
or transfer rate and that's in Giga
transfers per second because it's
bi-directional and then you have actual
throughput how much performance can you
actually get out of a device that's
connected to this and here we can see
that with Gen 2 by 4 you have 2
gigabytes per second whereas with Gen 3
it pretty much doubles to about 4
gigabytes per second so going back to
one of your original questions is it
worth it to invest in a PCIe Gen 2 by 4
SSD no it's not remember PCI Express is
backwards compatible you can take a Gen
3 m dot 2 SSD and slot it in there and
it will simply cap the bandwidth so you
won't get the maximum amount of
bandwidth so all you have to do is check
how fast the SSD is that you want to
connect the WD black 500 gig is a very
fast time dot 2 nvme SSD 3400 megabytes
per second so we can pretty clearly see
here that if you were to plug that drive
into a Gen 2 by 4 connection that caps
at 2 gigabytes per second you'd be
significantly hampering the overall
performance of this drive and that is
not even including again the potential
little latency hit that it might see
going to the PCH rather than directly to
the CPU stepping back a bit though to
answer your other question which is why
do they include these well specs on a
motherboard are often a big selling
points and then also you could
potentially get a less expensive SSD
that slots in there and it would it does
give you more bandwidth and more
performance than a typical SATA
connection so I'd rather have it there
than not but I completely understand if
you're a little bit confused as to those
2 slots and the difference between them
and I hope this explanation has helped
you a little bit my last questions here
in reference to last month's so this is
actually the last two months we've been
talking about the difference between fan
sizes the key to air power here which is
a very appropriate name is pointing out
that my mat my fan math is wrong because
I did the dimensions of the fan itself a
vertical horizontal getting the entire
area here with they're pointing out is
if you really want to compare the
difference between fan performance you
need to use PI and PI R squared you need
these you need to use some higher-level
math which I can do but not off
top of my head to get the area of the
fan the circular area of the fan and
then you have to subtract the area of
the fan hub and that will give you the
effective area of actual gap here that
the fan is effectively pushing air
through so I appreciate that being
pointed out as well I think we have
beaten that horse to death so let's move
on but I do appreciate the clarification
there this one is about the migrating
windows question that was asked last
month and I pretty much answered that by
saying I always do a clean install
that's my recommendation but there is
some more nuance to that and I'll Pierce
who asked the question was replying to
be 28 UB would it be and thank you to
both of you for responding to each other
and helping each other out also total
insanity for here who is pointing out a
Cronus basically and a Cronus license is
often included with an SSD and if I am
forced to do a migration an operating
system migration from an existing drive
over to a new drive if I'm upgrading a
system drive or something like that
a Cronus has always been my go-to it has
worked most consistently for me so that
is where I would direct you if you're
looking to do an actual migration and
then the other thing I was going to
point out here just to follow up that as
well if you have a hard drive an
existing mechanical hard drive in your
computer and that's what your operating
system is running off of and you want to
upgrade to an SSD do not use this method
because there are differences with the
actual Windows installation between a
spinning mechanical hard drive and an
SSD you want to clean install on an SSD
for the first time so don't use it in
that situation but upgrading an SSD yes
and a Cronus is totally a viable option
for you finally James Bustan says I
watched this with some sony 1000 XM 3s
on and couldn't hear hero at all this is
a follow-up to last month's question
about the audio solution I've been using
so thanks to you guys for that I have
been using some of your suggestions for
this past month so we've been doing a
little bit less background music when
it's just me up here talking and hope
you guys appreciate that and maybe it's
improved things just slightly one last
thing to point out guys if you watch our
live show I mean what helps send
something in for me to open up live on
the show during mailtime Paul's Hardware
peel box for 3:00 to 5:00 feel free to
send me stuff we open packages usually
every two three four weeks on the live
show depending how much stuff we have
coming in so thank you guys for your
support thank you guys as well for
watching this video hit the thumbs up
button and for
leave me those comments in the comment
section below for me to answer next
month we'll see you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
