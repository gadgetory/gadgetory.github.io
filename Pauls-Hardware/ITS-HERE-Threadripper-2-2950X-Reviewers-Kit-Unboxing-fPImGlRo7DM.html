AMD sent these boxes over and I already
know what's in them thread referred to
and they also said hey there is an
unboxing embargo for these products
which means there's a date AMD is
telling us for viewers we can unbox
these products show them off to you guys
but we can't test them we can't show any
performance numbers yet and as I God
like I have these conflicts about
unboxing videos and their viability and
usefulness and is it just free
advertising for the vendor and of course
this is all to be blamed on Steve from
gamers Nexus but ultimately I decided
I'm gonna unbox these anyway so here is
my unboxing a thread refer to as well as
whatever else is in these boxes the
thermal take view 71 snow edition shows
off your build in style with a frosty
white paint job and for tempered glass
side panels you also get two
pre-installed hundred and forty
millimeter ring white LED fans a
vertical GPU mount with bracket and
3-way radiator support for water cooling
so click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more shall we begin
actually before the unboxing let's get
to some of the straight dirt on what
thread refer to actually is dr. part two
is going to be split into two series of
CPUs the X series and the WX series but
both of them are based on 12 nanometers
m+ architectures the same stuff that
rise into that launched earlier this
year is based on so you have the X
series of CPUs which are slightly more
mainstream at a price of six hundred and
fifty dollars and nine hundred dollars
respectively for the twenty nine twenty
X and the twenty nine 50x a 12 core and
a sixteen core so similar layout to what
we already have this year with the 1920
X and the 1950 X albeit at reduced
prices and higher frequencies so that's
pretty nice also you get the benefits of
Rison too and then we have the WX series
this is what people were really drooling
over after it was announced at Computex
the 2970 WX is a 24 core 48 thread CPU
for $1300 4.2 gigahertz turbo on this
one and a 3 gigahertz base clock and
then the big Daddy
the 2990 WX $1,800 32 cores and 64
threads and a 4.2 gigahertz
turbo frequency that's pretty nice and
of course the WX series also based on 12
nanometers n plus Ludacris
multi-threaded performance and I do come
like the heavy-metal aesthetic that
AMD's going for here with their
marketing materials I I appreciate it
so those are the four CPUs interesting
that it doesn't seem like they're going
with an eight-core version this time
around which I'm okay with and they are
positioning the x-series CPUs as for
enthusiasts and gamers whereas the WX
series CPUs are for creators and
innovators because really if your main
goal is gaming you're not gonna get a
whole lot of benefit out of 24 cores or
32 cores heck even 16 cores it's hard to
argue for that but this is for
enthusiasts and people who want to like
gaming stream at the same time or use a
computer for other tasks besides just
playing games finally here's a look at
availability the 2990 WX will actually
be coming soonest on August 13th so
that's available next week August 31st
is a launch date for the 2950 X and then
in October we should be seen the 2970 WX
and the 29:20 X one last date to point
out pre-orders go up for this today so
along with this video and if I can find
them I'll put some links to where you
can pre-order these in the description
down below so now we have a slightly
better idea of what to expect with this
launch and speak up expectations I have
already been informed that at least for
this initial launch I will not be
receiving this 2990 WX sad face
I know how disappointing but I am making
a pitch to grab one of those because I
am very interested in integrating one
into Riptide because Riptide totally
deserves 2990 WX if you guys agree post
comment down in the comment section
below and the meantime though we've all
learn all this stuff like psycho
cardboard packaging and do the updated Z
that's extreme I'm gonna open this
mysterious little white box first
because it says not for retail sale and
I honestly have no idea what this is we
have oh well all day hey that's not bad
I do believe this is my first 970 Evo I
have worked a decent amount with a 960
Evo 970 is even faster
so thanks Samsung for including this in
the kit I will definitely be making use
of this really really fast nvme SSDs
next the motherboard now X 3 9
is still the chipset and there are not
necessarily there's not like a new
chipset or a new socket 4x 399 there
will be some new motherboards with some
enhanced power delivery but AMD was able
to confirm that all of the existing x3
99 motherboards they've checked with all
the motherboard manufacturers and since
the TDP is increasing for these CPUs the
12 and 16 core will still be hundred an
80 watt TDP but the 24 and 32 cores will
be 250 watt TDP the power delivery to
drive all those cores was kind of
important but every motherboard
manufacturer said our existing x3 99
motherboards are ok for that so the
stock out of the box frequencies for the
2990 WX you will need a BIOS update but
you'll be able to pop it in and it will
work even with a an x3 99 motherboard
that you maybe bought last year that
said when it comes to overclocking there
is a case to be made for increased or
enhanced power delivery or at least
giving a bit of a boost to the power
delivery systems that are already there
so for some boards like what asus has
decided to do with the zenith extreme i
do believe this is a new revision of the
motherboard but there's not too many
changes that have made them update the
name or do a mark 2 or anything like
that but this little kits is something
you can add on to it and this will just
provide some active cooling over the
heatsink on the V RMS to keep that cool
make sure it's providing adequate power
delivery to the CPU um but of course as
the launch happens I'm sure there's
gonna be lots of different testing with
different motherboards to see which is
the ideal solution for overclocking that
said the zenith extreme is still super
badass and there it is and I've already
shown you guys this motherboard before
so let's move up get off pulling the
thread Ripper and I'm told that you will
still get the bracket so that any
existing ASA tech-based cooler can pop
on there and does still work just fine
for cooling but if you want to get
special with it maybe consider something
like this from inner max this is the
liquitex TR for 2 so I don't know what
they have done to change this and update
it to make it version 2 but I didn't use
the first version of the liquid SEC with
my entry-level thread Ripper built last
year and I thought it was a really solid
cooler just from a visual perspective as
well as the actual performance it looks
like they are maintaining that with this
version 2 it's got a nice sort of matte
finish on the side with the inner max
logo maybe a little bit of texturing
there as well and it does this look like
this pump block has been said
Stanly updated it is even beefier than
it was before it's got the thread Ripper
mounts already pre-installed they're
huge copper contact plates and then it
does look like it's probably gonna light
up maybe some RGB lights around the edge
here under this pili off bit with the
inner max logo I'm not gonna take that
off right now because I don't want to
scuff it up but there it is the NR max
liquid tech tr4 - box number two
everything couldn't fit in just one
package go all right and I believe this
is the somewhat more legitimates thread
Ripper unboxing experience here I think
this is what I supposed to do it's and
they're so snuggly huh MD told me that
their marketing crew is actually pretty
excited about the box design that they
did for the threader for to unboxing so
I I'm thinking this is pretty cool so
far oh there we go oh it smells like it
smells like fresh foam like it smells
good but also kind of like maybe
unhealthy Wow there it is
2950 X give you guys the 360 view
there's a big X on the box that totally
makes sense tucked in over here on the
side we have a flare X memory kit oh
wait wait for it - which makes sense
quad-channel memory you would want four
of these yeah and that we have our third
Ripper 2950 X packaging there let's see
what else more foam it smells kind of
like the paint you use on like models
like model cars back in the day that
kind of makes you feel light-headed and
woozy is AMD using some kind of special
tricks here to give us a feeling of
euphoria as we unbox the shredder prints
of that stuff I don't know gonna save
the CPU for last let's look in here this
I believe is a wraith Ripper yeah so
Wraith Ripper is a 250 watt TDP air
cooler that cooler master designs in
collaboration with AMD specifically -
cooled threader / - and this thing is oh
my gosh that is beastly Wow
don't please there's nothing protecting
the free apply thermal paste here it's
on my fingers now and okay so this is my
first actual look at wraiths Ripper
outside of photos and it's a big old air
cooler with just massive stacks of fins
there are one two three four five six
seven heat pipes going from the base of
this thing to the top it's got a big ol
contact plate on the bottom with pre
apply thermal paste as I have already
discovered and I can't tell for sure but
I think it might have like pastors here
so you can actually screw in you know to
actually mount it and of course then
you've got RGB lighting that goes all
the way across the top as well on this
sort of glossy pad and what is this is a
plug oh yeah probably plug to plug in
and control that RGB lighting so there's
there's wraiths Ripper I'm I'm impressed
it's heavy like not insanely heavy but
it also feels fairly dense like that
just feels like there's a lot going on
in this place oh there's there's the
fans in the middle too like in the dead
center of this thing you can only barely
see it and now folks the main events the
2950 X and I feel like there's some
instructions here or something I should
be following but let's just plug there's
a handle this will handle the holder on
top so I think I'm supposed to pull
these little tabs off on the side like
that and then that lets me uh-huh
lift that up now I can actually see the
processor from there alright let's just
lifts out like that so I'm pretty sure
for anyone who actually buys this you're
not gonna get this part I think this was
part of the reviewers get this here is
the actual box with the actual thread
ripper and we'll see if it's any more
confusing than the old dread Ripper was
to unbox they are at least maintaining
the rip here functionality I will have a
rip yeah it's ripping oh I ripped too
much that better
ah-ha ripping that open is revealed a
little tab underneath I thought you're
supposed to pull up on this tab they
actually push it over to the side and
that releases the lid so I can lift the
lid up which is on a hinge and that
let's just look inside there's a little
box in here so I'm gonna pull that out
it's kinda like Excalibur like only the
worthy can actually pull it from the
stuff okay alright I just kind of lift
it another thing so I will say for the
first time opening
this box I do like that I didn't have to
rip this completely so that doesn't snot
falling apart I kind of read taped it on
my last boxes so I could hold it it's
not the most practical box but it is
does look kind of cool so if you got to
keep it up on a shelf or something after
you've got your system put together I
imagine you can and I also imagine that
I'm gonna know what's included in here
they're two four sticker a little bit
more information warranty info case
badge and then here we have the thread
ripper ace tech standard mounting
bracket so you have an if you have an
existing ace tech all-in-one liquid
cooler that uses that standard circular
mounts you can use that for it and it
will do a perfectly adequate job at
keeping your thread Ripper cool enough
since it doesn't ship with a cooler in
the box and then of course you got the
starter for a mounting tool and this is
for after you get the threat for CPU in
the socket you use this to tighten it
down and this will specifically tighten
it to a level of torque that's listed on
the device here so kind of tighten it
and then it snaps once it's done it's
also got the hex key down there as well
and then last but not least of course
the actual thread ripper 22950 x in its
carrier frame and there it is III really
just love how substantial and sizable
these actual feel I like that they have
their own frame I like the sort of
slightly more advanced method for
installing them I've just been really
happy with what AMD has done with the
Ripper starting last year in 2017 and
now continuing it in 2018 so but guys
that is gonna wrap it up for this video
I really hope you've enjoyed it
I certainly have just doing a fun
unboxing of new toys it's always
exciting but if you did hit the thumbs
up button and of course subscribe to my
youtube channel because I will have a
review on thread over to the 2950 X at
least coming up very soon actually
August 13th is when we're actually able
to post reviews on these so expect it
right around that timeframe thanks again
for watching guys and we'll see you next
