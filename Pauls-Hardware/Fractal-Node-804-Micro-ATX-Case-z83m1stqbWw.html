back to Pauls hardware today's video is
going to be my review of the brand new
fractal design at node 804 micro ATX
computer case so the node 804 is a micro
ATX chassis it's got a very short and
squat to design in case it wasn't
already obvious and it's basically set
up in two chambers so you have the main
chamber on the left side if you're
looking at the front of it that has the
motherboard as well as CPU graphics card
more heat generating components and then
the right side if you're looking at the
front is going to be where the power
supply goes as well as a bunch of
different storage base so you can fit a
bunch of drives in there the contents
apart from the case itself you get a
user's guide he also gets a really good
build walk through in that user's guide
so that's pretty nice to have it's
really useful for sort of an atypical
form factor like this one they also get
some zip ties all of the screws optical
drive brackets standoff nut for
tightening standoffs and rubber washers
for the hard drives there's a grill at
the bottom of the front of the case and
that stuff's for air flow has kind of a
minimalistic design kind of sticking
with the fractal kind of minimalist
basic sort of look to it but very clean
brushed aluminum on the front so that's
a very nice although it does tend to
pick up quite a few fingerprints and
then it's got a fractal logo down in the
lower right hand side and as well as a
white led along the right edge you have
a slim slot-loading optical drive bay
also have mic and headphone jack power
button there is no reset button on this
bear that in mind
double USB 3.0 ports and then the actual
size of this case is 307 millimeters
high 342 millimeters wide and 383
millimeters deep that's 12 0.09 by 13
point 4 6 by 15 point Oh 8 inches the
left side over here has a large clear
Plexiglas window so you can ocol the
interior components after you get that
all put together then on the right side
you have a basic solid thick gauge steel
side panel on the back you can get sort
of a better idea of the layout so you
can see you got a couple fan mounts at
120 or 140 on the left side a 120 on the
right side
io as well as expansion brackets for the
their board in the power supply which
mounts in the lower left on the top you
have a removable panel which just slides
back and off and it's held on with some
thumb screws and this one is quite nice
because it covers the entire top it is
grilled on the top and that has a mesh
filter right beneath that so that's
going to keep all the dust out of the
top since there's a lot of openings up
there you also have more dust filtration
along the bottom so you have a longer
moveable filter along the bottom for the
main chamber then you get a shorter one
for the power supply which unfortunately
is kind of difficult to remove without
actually tipping the case up but still
nice EDD it is there also on the bottom
you have some rubber feet which is very
nice to help with noise and vibration
and of course the case is very stable
stakes to its widest stance now both
side panels the top panel and the front
bezel are easily removed just like that
although the front panel does still have
the cables attached to it there's two
more long dust filters that cover the
forefront fan or radiator mounts and I
love this because it means any of all
the intakes as well as the top all
filtered so just make sure you can
access all of them wherever you have the
case actually setup speaking of radiator
support the note 804 features a crap ton
of potential radiator configurations the
front can support a 240 on either side
the top can fit a 240 in the main
chamber over here and a 280 on the power
supply side you can't do all of those
radiators at the same time though so
just bear that in mind you can also fit
up to ten case fans throughout this
chassis and many of the mounts to
support 120 or 140 millimeter band sizes
you have a three-position fan controller
it located here at the back as well the
main chamber on the left side is for all
of your higher components like your CPU
and your video card interior is fully
painted black and it's got some
signature fractal white highlights on
the fan blades and the expansion
brackets at the back you get five
expansion brackets by the way so you can
go ahead and go with a 2-way GPU
configuration that is supported with
micro ATX just bear in mind that if you
do a second two slot GPU down at the
bottom it's probably going to block the
two bottom mounts that you have down
there for 3.5 inch or
point 5-inch storage drives there's a
large cutout in the motherboard tray for
a CPU backplate and there's a couple
more aptly sized routing holes towards
the front for routing your cables and
for cable management and I also want to
point out that I really like the cable
tie downs down at the bottom as well on
the power supply side you have a power
supply I'm out surprisingly enough you
also have rubber mounts to support the
power supply which also makes me very
happy and you have the thoughtful
inclusion of a couple velcro straps
right behind the power supply so that's
going to help you out a lot with cable
management's at the top you can hang up
to eight 3.5 inch drives in these white
cages the cages can be removed with
thumb screws the drives melt with screws
and rubber washers inside for the record
I do prefer to screw mount mechanical
hard drives just does a lot more stable
that way the whole assembly up here can
be removed as well if you want to fit in
a radiator or if you just hate 3.5 inch
drives because of what they did to your
sister
finally for drive support you also have
a couple stealth 2.5 inch drive mounts
tucked into the back of the front bezel
so I'm hopefully going to be building a
brand new HT PC gaming system in this
particular case that's coming soon or at
least sooner rather than later hopefully
button closing ended when I say it seems
like a really well designed computer
case a great job by fractal with the
note 804 it seems really well suited for
what I'm intended to use it for gaming
htpc but you could also set up maybe a
small server or something like that in
this with all of the drive mount support
you could perhaps even go for a portable
gaming system not exactly carrying
friendly but it is small enough that you
could easily move it around it's not
going to be terribly heavy but I also
like that it's a really well designed
micro ATX chassis I tend to lean a
little bit more towards micro ATX as
compared to mini ITX when it comes to
smaller form factors I just like that
you get a little bit more expandability
you can actually set up a single or
2-way SLI or crossfire configuration and
having extra slots there is great for
something like a gaming HD PC because I
need a slot for the video card as well
as a slot for the cable card that I'm
also going to be using from scene but
that's all for this video guys thank you
very much for watching don't forget to
leave me a comment down in the comment
section let me know what you thought of
this particular case give me a like
while you're down there if you enjoyed
this video and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
