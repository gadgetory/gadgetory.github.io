to you by gigabyte Coolermaster team
group and thermaltake okay guys I'm at
Asus I came here to talk about some
graphics cards and motherboards but then
I got completely distracted by this
phone it's an ROG phone Asus made phones
before but this is the first ROG phone
which means it's not just for talking on
the phone it's also for gaming it's
actually an amazing device it has three
USB sea ports on it to connect in
various ways I'll get to that in a
second
but first just the gritty specs right
here it's got a Qualcomm SD M 845
processor game cold vapor chamber
cooling system they're using copy copper
in there to keep the whole thing cool 90
Hertz display with one millisecond
response time an AMOLED screen with HDR
air triggers for playing games as well
as advanced a fake peptic Slyke it's got
the thing I like the pixel to haves
where you can squeeze the sides the SDM
a45 processor is bin so that they can
run at a higher frequency to 0.96
gigahertz and then physically very slim
but not too slim feels very sturdy it's
got a really cool design on the back
it's distinct it's got the ROG logo of
course there's a bit of ventilation here
for that cooling unit that they've
designed that they put in their dual
cameras standard as well as a wide-angle
and then it's got a bit of a glossy
finish on the bag on the bottom here is
two USB sea ports it's a double port and
that is specifically made so they can
connect to accessories and also provide
more power to the units in order to
power accessories or to charge the unit
the support quick charge 3.0 on the side
here we've got a power button as well as
a volume rocker pretty standard over
there and then on the bottom we've got
another USB type-c so it's in a bit more
standard location and a headphone jack
thank you Asus for not ditching the
headphone jack we greatly appreciate
that if you add this accessory on again
includes a fan to keep things cool
passes through the RGB logo so you can
still see it even though it's covered
when you add this on probably going to
be using this while you're gaming and
then it adds a type C port and a
headphone jack at the bottom so if
you're using it in landscape mode if
you're probably going to be have an
easier time with those cables coming out
the bottom rather than on the
one side or the other and accessories of
course well I have all those USB ports
on there if you can't support
accessories this one's called the game
vice it's actually a dual unit kind of
stretches across the back there and it's
got some magnets on the back so when you
remove it you can connect it up together
and make it a little bit more portable a
little bit more storage you can use this
in combination with that fan accessory
that goes on the back so you can keep it
cool if it's starting to get warm and
then this just gives you a much more
ergonomic experience a lot more similar
to say something like a switch you got
joysticks on the top I also get for
trigger or shoulder buttons up here on
the top and then this also has a
pass-through for the type see down here
on the bottom as well as another
headphone jack and Asus just works with
the software in order to make sure you
can map these different buttons to touch
screen points on there to make it
compatible with up to 200 different
Android games next accessory is the twin
view dock which kind of makes it look
like you have two phones but basically
they've taken the same screen AMOLED
screens added a second one in the dock
so you can put your phone in there then
you have two screens dual screen
functions gonna work with a lot of
different games so you can put a map
down on the bottom as well as the game
up on top I'm told you can you can also
do streaming if you're going to do
twitch streaming on this and like even
have the camera point at you while you
scream from your phones that's pretty
insane I have to imagine you want to be
plugged in for something like that
battery life is actually pretty
impressive for this one four thousand
milliamp hour battery in the phone
itself and then if you add the twin view
dock this is going to add an extra six
thousand milliamp hour battery it's
integrated into this dock itself so if
you are going to take it on the go and
want to game for a long time you're
probably want something like this it's
also got a economic handles on the side
so it kind of wraps around with your
fingers or trigger buttons on the back
still maintains that headphone jack
right up here on the front and then
around the back USB C pass-through and
an SD card slot so if you have lots of
games take up a lot of space even though
the phone itself is going to have either
hundred and twenty eight gigs or the
upgraded bottle of 512 gigs of memory SD
card slot will allow you to take more
games with you on the go and another
crazy accessory this basically turns
your phone into a full computer this is
the mobile desktop dock
so you slot your phone right in there
again via that double USBC connector
down at the bottom and then this expands
it with just a ton of ports and
connectivity SD card reader on the side
Scotty
be three port on here which I believe is
to connect it's an actual PC if you want
to there's a DisplayPort out as well as
an HDMI out so you can power a 4k
monitor from your phone now this of
course means that you can also connect
up a keyboard mouse headset and this is
also Ora compatible so if you install
the Ora software you can synchronize the
RGB lighting on the phone with Ora
peripherals and accessories such as
their headsets and keyboards and also
it's got an entire key mapping software
that they've integrated here and ensure
that you have compatibility with various
games and of course to map the different
keys on the keyboard to the different
functions in the game that you might
want to play interesting sidenote we
discovered that if you have this
connected and you hit the windows button
it will pull up android assistance and
then Android assistant will get mad at
you and then rounding out connections on
the back another USB type-c port for USB
standard type a ports a Gigabit Ethernet
jack so you can get a wired connection
and not have to rely on wireless mic and
headphone jacks and then an HDMI to go
along with your full-size DisplayPort
out oh I almost forgot to mention s/pdif
connections so you can actually do a 5.1
surround output from this device so I'd
like you're not going to need a computer
or a home theater or anything anymore
all you're going to need is a phone and
just dock it and then you've got
everything that you need I don't know
how I feel about this if I build
computers but I'm sure there's just
another option of course to add to your
gaming repertoire but guys this has been
the ROG phone this is an insane at new
product from Asus I was not expecting
this I I don't know what I was expecting
for me to stick Computex they always
have something cool though so let me
know in the comments what you think of
this phone what you think it should cost
because they are not telling us the cost
of this phone right now
I hope it's reasonably priced but leave
me the comments in the comment section
thank you guys so much for watching this
video and of course a huge thank you to
my complex sponsors gigabytes team
Coolermaster &amp;amp; Thermaltake we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
