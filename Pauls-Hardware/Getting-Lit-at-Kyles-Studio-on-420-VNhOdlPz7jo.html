hardware today this video is a
production video so I'm gonna be talking
about my production techniques here
specifically lighting I got my first
lights to make youtube videos like 6
years ago now I actually back when I was
still living in my apartment and I
really haven't upgraded much from that
I'm gonna show you real quickly what I'm
using now and then we're gonna take a
field trip down to Kyle's office because
he has improved his lighting and that's
not due to any magnificent knowledge
that Kyle has it's because of Chris and
Chris is Kyle's camera guy that some
editing also does some lighting work so
I'm gonna see if I can get some feedback
some suggestions from him and how I can
improve the lighting here in my garage
so I've started this video with most of
my lights off and please forgive the
mess of rising to stuff that's still
over there but right now I've got on is
these orb
these big orb lights that are up above
and these are just using some China
balls and just a single fluorescent
light inside them they are I believe
5,000 K rated lights so it's kind of
daylight I do try to go with daylight
lighting in here as much as possible the
biggest upgrade to my lighting that I've
done recently if I can find where to
turn it on is the addition of these
background RGB LEDs I usually keep these
blue just because it matches with the
gray walls pretty well and this added
background lighting so that gave me a
little bit of depth you don't
necessarily just want to have a single
source of lights and this will also
provide some bit of lighting in the back
gun and when I added this I was like wow
that really makes things look a lot
nicer of course I'll usually have arctic
Panther on in the background there too
and that adds a bit more of lighting in
the back but my main sources of light
just switched on via those switches
there are these big soft boxes so I've
got two sets of these this is actually
from the smaller set that I originally
got back at the apartments these are by
cowboy studio they've got five
individual bulbs inside each one and
because they're cheap and they're made
to be collapsible and somewhat portable
they're like starting to fall apart as
far as the softbox is there in the
corners but if you look inside you can
see these are fluorescent see CFL bulbs
I usually only keep maybe two or three
of them on at a time and I try to rotate
and switch between it so they don't burn
out and on the plus side those bulbs
there's still the original bulbs so
those have lasted a long time but these
are just there
light and flimsy the stands down here
don't always stay up and they tend to
start to collapse and that kind of
things so adding some C stands here that
are actually real professional C stands
I think would be cool I should still be
able to use my ceiling mounted pole
right here that I did in my my simple
machines hardware blog that I did the
pulley setup on this floor that's I
should have been pretty convenient
because I can raise it and lower it if I
want to but other than a third softbox
that I have over here that I switch on
when I'm shooting stuff here on the main
work table that's pretty much all the
lights I have but ultimately my goal
when setting this all up was just for
there to be light enough lights for it
to be daylight's and for it to be not
too challenging to move around but I'd
like to move on to something that's
maybe a little bit prettier maybe gives
me a little bit more flexibility maybe
lets me add a little bit more color and
as you can maybe see the lighting on my
face right now I'm just sitting in my
desk it's very uniform across the whole
thing so making that a little bit more
dynamic with like a key and a fill I
think would be great
there's your train coming right now but
that doesn't matter I'm gonna go to
Kyle's all right guys I've made my way
to Kyle's office I've come here every
couple weeks to do awesome Hardware of
course and in here it's where the magic
happens as you can see okay
oh it's look it's Kyle and Heather
they're working all right doing work
okay yeah I came just for stack attack
that's the only thing we're gonna do
stack attack today I check out that on
Kyle's channel and that's obviously the
only reason I'm here yeah I know you
guys stay here I'm gonna go talk to
Chris and see what he's up to
okay they're nice they're totally fooled
taking advantage of them
oh look Joe's here that's very
convenient hey Joe can you be the camera
person
sure all right just cameraman now so
here is where awesome Hardware happens
we usually sit right over here and this
is Chris hey Chris how's it going Chris
does editing lighting what else do you
do for Kyle camera can work everything
else all the hard stuff like Heather
does all of Kyle's arrangements for
sponsorships and everything and like
Chris does all the
I don't know what Kyle doesn't care like
this okay takes care of like the
creative stuff you know all those
creative ideas he can be pretty creative
alright so Chris let me here's my issue
here's my problem and Joe can probably
relate to this I tend to get things set
up so that they're functional so that
they work and then I just leave them as
it is because I'm like that works I
don't want to touch of course and that's
what I've been doing with my lighting
for the past like five years so I have
an understanding basic understanding of
the simple three point lighting scheme
that you typically learn about in film
school that kind of thing you got your
key where the bright light comes in you
got to fill usually there's some balance
between those that's my problem right
now I have no balance adds a bit of a
dynamic contrast to the face and that
kind of thing and then there's a hair
light which goes up and over the
shoulder from behind so I would like
some advice on perhaps some upgraded
lighting itself okay maybe switching
from florescent LEDs and then also just
tips on positioning and how to make
things pop I want this to pop alright
let's get started we're sure these are
lights these are indeed lights so I
guess where I would start off is you
know choosing the type of lights that
you want okay right now we're using all
pretty much all exclusively LEDs okay
primarily because you know low wattage
pool meaning you don't have to you can
run a lot of lights
you won't blow any circuits in your
house or as if you like we're running
tungsten lights they would not only get
really hot they would pull a lot of
power and you tend to blow your circuit
breaker there's one thing that I liked
about switching from tungsten to
fluorescents was less power drop LEDs
are even less than that yes and also of
fluorescents in my experience they tend
to have like a little bit of a green
tint serene yes so you can fix that in
post but it's not ideal right also with
the fluorescents you have to be careful
with if you're shooting any high frame
rate or high speed shooting they
sometimes tend to flicker sometimes with
a with tungsten that's what they're
known for is high frame rate
capabilities okay but yeah right now
we're using all LEDs what's really
keying crucial is that they're bicolor
okay so you can change them from a warm
tungsten source to a cooler daylight
kind of temperature color temperature
okay right now they're kind of in the
middle just because we have also some
fluorescents in here too you know kind
of try and match that when they're on
but and and my my mo and my garage is
everything's just daylight yeah that's
pretty much what I do so that's adding a
little a little more warmth I think
would be nice there yeah yeah so these
are gonna just him right you can they
are a job well not only in in the
dimming but you can also adjust the
color temperature so kind of warm to a
cooler daylight you know like you said
nice so very very flexible and that idea
this one in particular is a spotlight
from hive lighting we got this primarily
because these are by color but this is
also RGB so just clarify for you guys
we're not caring about the lighting in
this video we're doing this video to
make sure that the lighting in future
videos is better alright so this one
this is expensive right this is a this
is like $1,000 it's for about a thousand
they just came out with another one I
believe it's like 2500 but it's a little
bit stronger they also have another one
that's cheaper I think half price I like
that so but they are all RGB and they
are all kind of fully customizable if
you will you can change you can change
your obviously dimming capabilities your
color temperature whatever you know RGB
value you want and however saturated you
want it's very very flexible in that
manner and it's LED so it's not gonna
get hot at all and this one's like
directional right so you're you're using
this to throw some light on the
background up against the wall so what
I'm doing is kind of like a little I
guess tip for you guys that you guys can
use is what we're doing called a color
contrast in this case we're kind of keen
we're gonna be keying you and Kyle with
just a normal kind of light frontal
light and then we're gonna be coloring
the background with a different light to
kind of make you pop or stand out as you
will okay from the background and that's
a very common thing to do in lighting
this kind of a color contrast you know
cool and it definitely makes the
background stand out a bit more and like
you said contrast yeah my subject to add
some life to the white walls you know
and depth that's yeah I did I did learn
a few things in film school you want
depth and shot usually want something in
the foreground mid-ground background
that's that's how Scorsese does it from
my understand he's a man so these are
acting as hair lights this is your Phil
over here key
that's our Yuki yeah and then I wouldn't
do it Phil I actually found it on the
ceiling
okay this isn't more like a room tone of
light okay yeah so the fill the fill is
really almost like incidental great yeah
I mean the fill is basically all the
light that's kind of bouncing around
throughout the walls you know especially
since they're white right now you're
gonna get a lot of kind of fill coming
from this wall from that wall from the
ceiling okay and you know I like to
attend early Phil from the from the top
down just because it gives this kind of
ambient what I call like room tone okay
so if you were to do like I like I say a
green color whatever bouncing it's gonna
the whole rooms gonna feel like you're
in a green like cavern or something
where as opposed if you use like a fill
light from the side it looks very
directional very sorce so that's a very
nice way to kind of hide your fill
okay is by bouncing off of like a white
roof or something even if you have like
a white bounce card that you can just
kind of hang there that that works too I
moved back over here because the key the
key light I think is something that has
been improved greatly so we've got an
LED behind a diffuser originally you
guys had to set up with just like a
sheet or a piece of plastic or something
just bare bulb or like a little thing of
silk okay but yeah this has been updated
with actual Pig this is this gel gel
that's the word I was looking for this
and this sort of spreads the light out
makes it soft good yeah because
obviously we're not doing like film or
anything like that right and it's also
great for filming because it helps
diffuse like reflections so you didn't
don't get a nasty reflects a quite
bolder so helps to bloom out the
highlights specular highlights okay so
if I wanted to set up something like
this and let's say I wanted to have it
suspended from the ceiling like what
what what do you think I should do for
that well what we recently have been
doing I kind of recommend it to Kyle is
to kind of upgrade the diffusion kind of
idea and we went along with this 25 foot
by I gosh I don't even know how long
this is like maybe four feet
there's same material price um extra
heat right yeah maybe yeah uh I'll
probably wouldn't miss this if I you
know I just rolled off a sheet I mean I
didn't see anything
all right you guys didn't hear anything
but we've essentially put this on a
c-stand and we kind of roll it down to
essentially give us the same effect with
that what that light is doing right now
it's kind of diffusing or softening the
look and effectively what it does is you
get a larger surface area which is very
important in how soft the light can get
is the surface area that the light takes
up so the bigger the surface area the
more diffused light will be the softer
it will will be kind of wrap around
corners that kind of thing exactly
exactly so as you can see this thing is
25 feet long so I'm not gonna unroll the
whole thing but I you it's a huge thing
that you know like you said you if you
wanted to suspend it from the ceiling
you could do so we usually just put the
actual arm just straight through okay
and it suspends it you know you can do
the same thing from the ceiling I would
assume you know some string or whatnot
and then just let it hang and just shoot
your lights too right and it looks
gorgeous right now this is a half
diffusion so what we do is we double up
on it when we need to do like any
reflections with like tempered glass and
and all that stuff and it's great with
like monitor reflections as well because
you don't get that really harsh little
spot on the on the monitor okay
I definitely need to get me some of that
then yes so it's convenient that we're
setting up we I didn't do any setup it's
convenient that Chris and Kyle and
Heather have set up four stack attack
because here is a pretty unique use case
scenario for setting up lighting two
different subjects since Kyle and I are
gonna be facing off and opposite sides
over here so what have you done to set
up the lighting here Chris well one
quick fix on what you said this is
actually for the intraspecific well this
is the intro because the lighting is
gonna change changing lighting between
shots that's also something I should
look into definitely so right now what
we have is a couple of or actually I
should say three LEDs from Dre cast
they're very kind of inexpensive options
to just get in general like light in
there for our set and then obviously we
have the hive wasp for that kind of
color throw but right now we have what
you just said is a
I essentially it I prefer them a little
bit better to just a normal back light
although back lights are nice they just
kind of like you said separate from the
background and help you kind of get that
depth and dimension in your shot
we kind of illuminating the other person
with an overhead just so that it's not
in the shot it's just trying to hide the
lighting be a little bit more subtle
with it and then right here we have the
key which is being diffused by a full
diffusion a full white diffusion for the
key right here that's gonna happen on
the little intro area but other than
that I mean it's pretty simple setup I
say simple but you know what's key also
in this is that we're using the C stands
because you know they're able to boom
out and kind of get overhead and you
know you can put put these lights almost
anywhere that you really want to I mean
they extend really high they they extend
outwards really far and they're able to
support a lot of weight since they're
you know either aluminum or steel
sometimes and just very overall
versatile so that's another huge thing
to consider okay so I have a shopping
list and I'm gonna do a follow-up video
where I actually integrate this advice
into my own setup so you get some of
these Dre casts LEDs and I'm gonna find
the specific models of these put the
links in the description as well I gotta
get one of those wasp hive wasp wasp 100
sea wasp 100 C that's probably gonna be
the big spend but that's really cool
because it can be used in so many
different scenarios yeah I mean what I
told Kyle is you know you can use a
spotlight for a spotlight purpose but
you can't use a you know soft light and
spot it so but you can always make a
hard light soft you can always make that
spotlight soft okay it's more you can
mate you can go from hard to soft but
it's harder to go from soft to hard
that's what we have learned today and
then finally of course C stands I got to
get some C stands I gotta replace those
flimsy LED stands that I've got back at
home so guys that's pretty much all for
this video I was just coming over here
of course theoretically to Snack Attack
but wanted to get some advice from Chris
I've been jealous of the lighting setup
that Kyle's got going on over here and I
can I can compare it I have the direct
comparison from what stuff looks like in
my garage which I thought was looking
pretty good for a while
let's go it's okay but again it's like
it's functional but it could be better
so I'm just looking to improve things
Chris thank you very much for your help
today thank you guys for watching this
video hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it again links to the products
are gonna be in the description and I'll
be back with more very soon and of
course check out stack attack because
don't tell Kyle that I actually used
Chris for other other purposes what
Chris Kyle alright well now I'm probably
in for it for stack attack but I don't
even know what the punishments are yet
kind of kind of worried actually but
guys if you enjoyed this video hit the
thumbs up button of course links to more
videos down in the description as well
as products that we discussed today and
again thanks for watching we'll see you
next time on Paul's hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
