hardware today's video is a quick
installation tutorial for installing a
thread Ripper processor the new CPUs
from AMD the socket that they install
into is called TR 4 or thread Ripper 4 I
believe the forest to line up with the a
m4 socket on their mainstream lineup and
even if you've installed the CP before
there are a few things you might want to
know about this installation process not
difficult but there are some quirks
before you even get to the socket though
let's start with a cpu in the box or at
least the last part of the box this
little tuck I'm going to need to pull on
this metal piece to pop it off of the
end and then simply grab the two tabs on
each opposite side squeeze a little bit
and you should be able to pop the top
off inside you'll notice a orange
protective plastic piece that's around
your Rison processor and that is
important and you want to keep that so
remove that do note that this is an LG a
processor land grid array so there are
no pins on the bottom there are gold
contact pads you should try not to cut
make contact with those but for now
we'll set the CPU aside now your retail
box should have come with a Torx
screwdriver in it but if it didn't then
a Torx t20 bit is what you want and the
three screws that you'll be paying
attention to are these three right here
note that they are labeled one is the
top one in the middle by itself and then
we have two on the bottom right and
three on the bottom left
also note they have left instructions
for you open is three two one and closed
is one two and three so in that order
we're just going to start unscrewing
these starting with three then we'll do
two and then we'll do one now when you
get screw one unscrewed you will
actually notice that the lid will
probably try to pop up by itself because
it is somewhat spring-loaded with the
upper bracket raised you'll see a lower
bracket beneath and two little blue tabs
towards the top of the socket just grab
those from the side and lift and the
lower bracket will pop out of place that
has catches on either side that hold it
there there's also a clear plastic piece
at the center and this is actually in
place of where your CPU should be we're
going to remove this by sliding it out
of the little bracket and the bracket is
called the carrier frame and note as
you're sliding it out that there's
little rails on either side and they
don't exten
that's the entire length of the frame
once you've ruins that you can just let
the carrier frame pop up all the way and
then you'll notice an actual protective
socket covered down below it says sake
sp3 go ahead and grip that from either
side and pull it up it should pop out
and it will expose the pins that are
underneath pins are very delicate so be
careful from this point on that you
don't touch them with anything or drop
anything into them now in case you're
wondering there is still a little
triangle on the corner of the carrier
frame as well as on the corner of the
socket itself but it's a little bit
easier just to pay attention to the
dummy frame that was removed and the
orientation that was in as you put the
CPU back in the same position so we're
just going to lower the CPU into the
frame very carefully making sure that
those rails line up and go inside the
little black rails instead of outside
they can get misaligned once it slid all
the way down into the frame we can just
lower that carrier frame back onto the
socket press down it should snap back
into place and be held there now that's
left to do is lower that top frame and
remember that our screw order is reverse
now one two three rather than three two
one I'm just going to do about a single
rotation on that top one just to get it
threaded that way hopefully number two
and number three down here will be
slightly easier to get threaded as well
and there we have it the CPUs installed
and guys that's going to wrap it up for
this tutorial if you have any friends
who are going to be building a thread
Ripper system please feel free to share
this video with them it's a thumbs up
and of course if you enjoyed it and feel

this one thanks again for watching and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
