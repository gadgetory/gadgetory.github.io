asked to meet me discreetly at an
undisclosed location I suspected a
variety of outcomes but I was in for a
surprise
Josh the master of disguise actually had
a new case for me to look at the define
r5 this is a mid tower ATX case and the
successor to the immensely popular
define r4 with two years in development
at a host of new features many of them
directly requested by fractal fans Josh
already demonstrated his confidence in
the define archives packaging it uses
hard film but there's plenty of it to
keep things safe if you're planning to
reship a finished build I have the black
version of the r5 with the solid side
panel for maximum noise dampening it
will also be made available in white and
titanium gray and windowed side panel
versions are also in the works MSRP is
$110 u.s. for this version and $120 for
the windowed ones aesthetically the r5
can easily be mistaken for the r4 or r3
for that matter when your calling card
is minimalist Scandinavian design I
suppose it's difficult to make things
much more minimalist II so stick with
what works right the black painted steel
and black plastic are matched perfectly
though and the swinging front door has a
full brushed metal panel it has a more
matte finish than earlier versions and
does a pretty good job resisting
fingerprints this door is padded for
sound dampening and is also reversible
so it can open either way it does
require a screwdriver but it is a simple
change to make behind the door you've
got a couple five and a quarter inch
bays with easily removable panels and
below that a large front intake with a
dust filter that's also easy to remove
and reinstall and has angled fins to
direct airflow and further reduce any
noise that might be trying to escape
from inside the case behind it is a
single 140 millimeter fan but more on
that later and space for another 140 fan
or water cooling radiators also more on
rad support in just a moment one of my
favorite new features of for the r5 is
at the bottom here and that's the
full-size dust filter that covers all
the bottom intakes on the case while
being accessible from the front this
means that you can clean all your intake
filters without needing to access the
back or bottom of the case other than
that on the bottom you have some pretty
standard raised feets with rubber pads
and removing the filter shows all the
mounts for fans and or radiators moving
to the top of the case front io includes
your standard mic and headphone jacks
recessed reset button power button with
blue LED backlights with a more recessed
activity light just below it and four
USB ports with the two SuperSpeed ports
labeled as 3.0 rather than having blue
plugs because fractal these are also
spaced out pretty well too for plugging
in more sizable USB devices the r5 does
still have a 3 speed 3 fan controller
built in the switch for that is tucked
it just inside the front door beneath
the top IO and is powered with a
standard SATA power plug now you may
have spotted the module vent panels at
the top of the case these three panels
are also padded for sound and can be
removed individually so you can have
that perfect mix of airflow or noise
reduction on the back of the case you
have a 120 or 140 millimeter fan or
radiator mount at the top its slotted so
you can shift your fan up or down for
proper spacing there's an IO shield
knockout of course additional hex
grilling for ventilation seven expansion
slots and a bottom mounted power supply
the side panels in traditional define
series fashion are dense and thick with
full padding for noise reduction the
right side has captured thumb screws so
you won't lose them and the left side
has an optional 120 or 140 millimeter
fan mount although it is not filtered
but not a huge deal and another cool
upgrade on the side panel is the
latching system for easy access to the
cases main chamber this was a feature
that I really liked the side panel swing
out for removal now to instead of using
catches along the top and the bottom
also an upgrade before we move to the
interior here's a look at accessories
individually bagged black screws a
standoff tightener that's unfortunately
plastic instead of metal and lovely
rubber washers for reducing hard drive
vibration inside we've got traditional
white accents on things like the
expansion slots fan blades and drive
cages which just looks cool these drive
cages are all metal and support up to 8
3.5 inch drives in a couple positions
within each sled as well as 2.5 inch
drives and again they are metal and way
better than plastic ones sure you need
screws to mount the drive to the sled
but I'm ok with that for hard drives the
drive cages themselves can be removed
complete
we turn sideways although I don't see
much call for that these days or move to
the middle mount closer to the PSU or
hung from the top of the case all by
removing some cleverly placed two thumb
screws the cages also have a more open
design to allow more air flow over the
drives the five and a quarter inch cage
is also easily removable the thumb
screws although the lowest drive cage
and the top bracket for the OD D Bay's
requires a screwdriver if you want to
pull everything up for maximum radiator
support so I've shown you radiator
mounts on the front bottom top and back
but what actually fits there the easiest
way to show you is to take a page out of
the well-written define our five manual
literally which shows up to three
hundred and sixty millimeter support up
front up to 240 on the bottom 120 or 140
at the back and up to 420 on top but
bear in mind that for wider RADS those
are the ones highlighted in blue you're
limited to 55 millimeters max thickness
for the radiator and your fans and of
course you couldn't do all of these at
the same time as a thick three hundred
and sixty millimeter read at the front
for example is going to block the
available space at the top and the
bottom just kind of make sense the
motherboard tray is finished in a
beautiful black paint job along with the
rest of the Interior is a fixed raised
standoff at the center which we're
seeing a lot more on cases these days
definitely and plus a generous CPU cut
out and plenty of well positioned rubber
grommet cable pass throughs also the PSU
mount at the bottom has some rubber
cushions to minimize your power supply
vibrations the two included case fans
are also new from fractal design they're
the dynamic GP 14 models and have
hydraulic bearings angled struts and
notched and grooved fan blades to smooth
out the noise profile and reduce humming
they are three pin only so no pwm
support but they do run very quiet and
can spin as low as 1000 rpm behind the
motherboard tray we have thoughtfully
placed cable tie downs and a wonderful
section running down the middle with
velcro straps for your beefier 24 pin
and GPU power connectors there are also
recessed areas for tucking away cables
at the bottom and towards the front
drive cages with plenty of space between
the tray and the side panel finally we
have two more hidden 2.5 inch drive
mounts back here and they've been
upgraded with removable trays so you
don't have to pull your motherboard out
to swap a drive
I'm going to go ahead and take credit
for this particular upgrade since I
complained about that shortcoming with
the define r4 so is this case quiet
well preliminary testing of the include
advance indicates yes and I've spoken
with some friends who have confirmed
that with a full build installed the
sound dampening on the side in front of
the r5 does a very very good job fractal
has built upon their past successes with
the defined series they've delivered a
case that has all the things that made
the r4 so popular while adding features
that fans have been asking for for a
while I particularly like the
versatility that the case has thankfully
modularity of the drive cages and the
extensive radiator support so my only
question now is what system should I
build in the define r5 I feel like I
could do anything from a sensible budget
rig to an all-out custom water-cooled
monstrosity so let me know what you
think I should do in the comment section
