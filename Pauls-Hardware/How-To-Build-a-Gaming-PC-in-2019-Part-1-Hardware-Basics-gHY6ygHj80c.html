creating videos about computers and how
to build them on YouTube and 2019 is no
different now that we're a couple months
into the year I'm creating a new how to
build a computer series this one is
aimed at beginners so if you've never
built a computer before you're thinking
you might want to do it
welcome and hopefully this video will
help you out whether you want to build a
larger computer or a smaller computer
the first thing you're going to want to
do is figure out what parts you need to
go in there choosing the parts can be
confusing in and of itself so in this
video we're gonna figure out how big you
want your computer to be how much you
want it to cost and of course how
powerful you want it to be I'm gonna go
over all the core parts of a computer
what they are what they do and give you
guys recommendations on what you should
buy right now this year so stay tuned
but first this video is sponsored by
Squarespace if you're interested go to
Squarespace comm slash fall sorry
where'd you get 10% off of your first
order of course hang out till the end of
the video for more on that for now let's
get started with computer building it's
funny how things change but also how
things stay the same so for instance my
recommendation still going back eight or
10 years is that you mainly only are
gonna need a Phillips head screwdriver
in order to assemble a standard
modern-day PC however they've gotten a
little bit fancier these days and they
even have integrated stuff like all
these fancy RGB lights not gonna be
diving too much into RGB lighting for
this video that's more of an aesthetic
thing my goal is to get you guys a
computer that's powerful and hopefully
affordable the lighting and the
aesthetics come later but going back to
those first three things you need to
decide one how big do you want your
computer to be 2 how powerful you want
it to be then three of course very
important how much do you want it to
cost computers can cost as little as
$400 for a computer that you can get up
and running with 600 to 800 dollars is
kind of a nice reasonable range to get
yourself a good functional computer that
you're not spending too much money on
then of course you can spend $1,000
1,500 $2,000 and beyond if you're
looking for high-end desktop components
high core count components high-end
graphics cards like the 20 80 TI that
can cost over $1000 themselves but let's
keep things a little bit more reasonable
to start out with and talk about what
you already have so since you're
watching this video I'm assuming you
have an internet connection at home and
you probably already have something that
you can watch YouTube with maybe that is
a cell phone or a tablet but maybe you
already have an existing computer and if
you already have an existing computer
you might have some stuff that you can
start out with and
over to your new computer continue using
the peripherals are the things apart
from the actual computer itself are the
things you can probably carry on using
and save yourself some money in the
process so you're gonna need a keyboard
you're gonna need a mouse you're gonna
need a monitor that can connect up to
your computer then you're going to need
that internet connection which is
probably handled by a router that's
provided by your internet service
provider the only reason I bring this up
is because your router might have
Ethernet plugs to plug in directly to
the computer or more likely you have
Wi-Fi available so you want to make sure
that your computer is set up and has a
Wi-Fi connection via an antenna that can
usually be purchased along with the
motherboard let's not get too far ahead
of yourselves just make sure that you've
got the keyboard the mouse to monitor
the internet connection beyond that I'm
mostly going to be focusing on the
computer itself from here on out
actually two other quick things before
we move on one is that if you want to be
able to hear your computer you're going
to need speakers or headphones of some
variety oftentimes your monitor has
speakers built into it so if you connect
via HDMI to your monitor you can have
sound that way but you might also
consider a headset something like this
that'll allow you to hear stuff and then
also if it's got a built-in microphone
if you're gonna play online games and
you want to talk to people a mic is a
very nice thing to have as well last
thing to check with your old computer
and this is not an old computer by the
way just using it as an example but is
there any old parts that you can reuse
chances are the core components and the
case would be harder to take over to a
new system but you might be able to
salvage a power supply if it's got
enough wattage and you might definitely
be able to salvage some old storage you
can take old storage hard drives wipes
them and reuse them as fresh new storage
so if you've got an old 1 terabyte hard
drive or something in an old system
consider reusing it just bear in mind
older hard drives can fail eventually so
you want to make sure you have that data
on there backed up somewhere else as
well so now let's get back to building
your computer and choosing the parts
that you want to go inside the way I
usually think about building a computer
the core computer itself is that there
are seven main components that you will
need to consider and have in mind in
order to get everything together and up
and running the first part is the CPU
the CPU also has additional parts
because there's a CPU and then there's a
heat sink fan that helps keep it cool by
providing a heatsink and a fan to blow
air over it those will sometimes come
with the CPU if you get certain CPUs
from AMD or Intel or if it doesn't you
might need to buy a third-party one
separately to install in there as well
and for that you have air coolers as
well as all-in-one liquid coolers like
the one that's currently installed in
this system
those can get more fancy and expensive
so I'm going to mostly be focusing on
the stock coolers that can come with the
CPUs that you buy but that's sort of
your assessment there second part is
going to be memory memory is volatile
storage so it only stores data while
there's actually power going to it it's
very fast and more of it will often make
your system faster more on that when we
get into the detail about the memory
though the motherboard is the central
components that sits in the case that
everything plugs into including a socket
for the CPU slots for the memory as well
as expansion slots over here to install
graphics card or other things like
capture cards there's a ton of
motherboard options out there when it
comes to the size of the motherboard the
compatibility with the socket for the
CPU and the CPU that you've chosen as
well as additional features that can
really drive up the price a lot
motherboards for me usually cost a
hundred to two hundred dollars this is
actually a high-end desktop motherboard
it has lots of memory slots we're not
going to be dealing with this today
we're mainly going to be focusing on the
mainstream platforms from Intel and AMD
right now for Andy that is socket AM for
for Intel they have socket LGA 1151 and
you want the newer version of that that
works with Intel's 8th gen and ninth gen
processors so the CPU the memory and the
motherboard of the first three
components and I list those together
because you need to make sure that
they're all compatible with each other
and they're also going to be very key to
the actual performance of your system
especially the CPU the memory to a
lesser extent when it comes to gaming
performance that is where you're going
to potentially want a graphics card
graphics cards again can range hugely in
price from 100 bucks all the way up to
$1500 and more most people in 2019 are
probably gonna spend between $200 and
$400 on a graphics card if you're
looking at a mid-range to high-end
system that's dedicated for gaming but
you can actually get away without having
your graphics card completely if you go
with integrated graphics that are built
into your CPU if you're going with an
Intel CPU I don't recommend that because
the integrated graphics aren't that good
if you're going Andy you need to make
sure you get an AMD APU they have a 2200
g and a 2400 G those are what I
recommend for entry-level builds that
you can get for as low as 400 to 500
dollars it's a great way to get up and
running with a gaming PC and not have to
invest the several hundred dollars in a
graphics card but also gives you the
ability to upgrade to that down the road
just bear in mind if you're getting an
APU you need a motherboard that has
video outs as well just three parts left
the next one is storage this is
long-term storage so this will save data
even when your computer is off there are
three
different variants of this the first is
old-school mechanical spinning hard
drives these are usually larger 3.5 inch
drives these you can get a lot of
storage for less money but they're not
as fast you're definitely going to want
an SSD for your main operating system
drive where you install windows for that
you can either get a 2.5 inch SATA SSD
like this and for this you can get a
very fast drive with good price per
gigabyte that you spend and then we also
have newer MDOT - SSDs like this one the
newest ones use nvme as a communication
protocol for the rest of the system but
they can cost a little bit more so it's
going to be up to you whether you want
to go with one of these or just stick
with a standard 2.5 inch SSD the last
two parts actually have the least amount
of impact on how fast your system is
going to be overall that is the case
which can largely be aesthetic but you
also want to make sure the case has
enough airflow to evacuate the hot air
that computers can generate while
they're being used and also case is
important when it comes to form factor
whether you want a standard full sized
ATX case like this or a mini ITX case
like this one back here that supports
smaller size motherboards more on that
in just a second but the last thing is
the power supply here's an example of a
power supply it's basically a brick that
plugs into the wall at one end so you
can get power from at your home and then
at the other end you're going to have
cables that come out and those provide
power to the rest of the components some
plug into the motherboard some will plug
directly into storage drives some plug
directly into your GPU more on that when
we get to the actual build in the next
video but there are some things you want
to consider about a power supply - which
we'll come back to in just a second so
let's talk about cases I have a few
different case examples for you guys
here the main thing you're gonna be
thinking about when you look at a case
is how much space do I have to work with
on my desk or wherever I'm going to be
keeping my computer and do I want
something that's small and compact and
maybe even portable to handle like this
little mini ITX case here from Corsair
or do I want something that's a little
bit more flexible full sized full ATX
mini ATX cases can be a little bit more
challenging to work with you simply
don't have as much space inside the case
as you normally would
you're also going to find a variety of
layouts so here you can see the
motherboard sets horizontally this is a
little mini ITX motherboard power supply
sits on the bottom is a few expansion
slots here for storage drives and that's
mostly it's I was able to fit an
all-in-one liquid cooler in this system
here as well but just overall a little
bit more cramped not quite as much room
to work with the cables and this is
on a large side when it comes to mini
ITX cases there is an in-between form
factor often neglected called micro ATX
so here's a micro ATX motherboard on the
left versus a full-size ATX motherboard
on the right micro ATX gives you a
little bit more expansion down here than
a mini ITX which is the smallest size so
it's kind of an in-between you're still
limited on case options for micro ATX I
actually don't have a micro ATX case
here to show you guys but for that
reason I'm gonna focus on full-size ATX
from here on out so these are both full
ATX cases you can really see the ATX
sized motherboard in that one also it's
showing off that cases that are fancy
and more expensive can have stuff like a
tempered glass side panel window that
lets you see into the case at your build
once it's all finished both of these
cases have a more normal vertical
orientation but neither of these cases
have the power supply where the power
supply usually is I just realized both
cases I have over there for an example
of case airflow are really bad examples
because neither of them use standard
case air flow so I'm using my very fancy
Arctic Panther custom liquid cooled
system to show you a more standard case
layout which is that we have intakes in
the front and it is very nice to have a
dust filter for your front intakes if
that's available on a case and then
after the air flows through the system
it can escape either via an exhaust at
the back here or an exhaust across the
top and the top exhaust is a very
popular place to put a radiator if
you're using liquid cooling or one of
the all-in-one liquid coolers that I
showed you on that first system also in
this layout the power supply is going to
be on the bottom left which lets you
look at it and then a lot of cases will
have sort of a basement area down here
at the bottom that's separated for the
power supply to kind of hide that in the
cables although that is mostly an
aesthetic edition and depending on how
pretty your cables are in your power
supply you may or may not wants a case
that has that of course these two cases
that I chose for this video both do not
use that standard layout mainly because
they have blocked off front intakes this
is the SL 600m from Coolermaster by the
way as well as the Leon leap TC 0:11
dynamic and white from LAN Li apart from
the airflow and power supply mount
though these have standard layouts which
is the ATX motherboard which is back
there on a motherboard tray at the back
of the case and that lets you install
everything on top of that the graphics
card which is installed right here
there's a Radeon 7 over in this one CPUs
in a socket at the centre of the
motherboard cooled by the air or
liquid cooler memory is in the slots
just to the right of that then your
storage might install directly to the
motherboard if you're looking at where
these little MDOT two drives or you'll
have 2.5 inch drive mounting points
where you can install SSDs so if you
figure out what size case you want and
you've taken a look at the airflow and
aesthetic concerns then you're probably
also going to be concerned about price
you can get cases as cheap as 20 bucks
or so but I would recommend about 40 to
60 dollars should be your ballpark range
for an entry-level case and you can get
really solid cases in the 40 to $60
range you can get a master box Q 300 L 4
45 or $50 this is a micro ATX case but
very solid all-around it's been very
well reviewed Coolermaster also has a
master box light 5 which is a full sized
ATX case but around 65 or 70 dollars the
fractal design focused G also available
for 55 or 60 bucks a very solid
mid-range all-black case
Corsair has got a carbide spec oh six
they just recently launched this is
another case it has a lot of features
for a budget price sells for 75 or 80
bucks normally but you can often get it
on sale for as cheap as 55 or 60 NZXT sh
500 is also a really solid case
available with a few accent colors as
well but you can get the black version
for 70 bucks fantex has the eclipse p
400 available for $80 this is again I
really solid all-around case so just
take a look at these cases their
features their reviews see if they have
a look that stands out to you factor in
your budget and then make a choice on
which one you want the last one here is
the fractal design mesh if I see this is
also a really solid case it has really
nice air flow so if you're concerned
about things getting warm that's a good
choice for you and this one you can get
for $100 next we'll look at power supply
and here there's a few things you should
consider a power supply you should be
able to get for about 40 to 60 dollars
as well so similar price to a mid range
case and the things that the power
supply will be concerned about are the
wattage whether or not is modular and
the efficiency rating for a standard
gaming PC I usually look at wattage
between 500 and 800 watts 500 is kind of
the starting out point you can't get
away with less than that but if you have
500 or 550 watts on your power supply
you'll be able to support mid-range and
high-end graphics cards if you add one
in the future next is the efficiency
rating you have bronze gold platinum and
titanium you at least want to get 80
plus bronze rated you can also take a
look at 80 plus gold rated power
supplies as well but you can usually get
better deals on the bronze ones as for
brands there are a lot of power supply
brands out
I typically go with EVGA Corsair see
sonic silverstone Rosewill has some good
power supplies but they also have some
bad ones too so you got to double-check
the reviews and then from there just
start looking at actual power supplies
to see how they're configured so of
course there for example has their CX M
series that they've recently updated so
they have all black cables they're also
partially modular modular cables allows
you to not use the cables that you're
not going to use because you don't need
all the cables that come with any given
power supply so here's a non modular
power supply on the right and you can
see how having this big gripper cables
in your case might be hard to deal with
and we have a mostly modular power
supply over here on the left this one
has a bunch of extra cables plugged in
here if I didn't need these I could
unplug them and then we have a few fixed
cables for stuff like the main
motherboard power connector the only
other thing you might want to consider
with a power supply is that these cables
again can look kind of ugly if you have
this multicolored nonsense going on
there I actually taped over this one to
block it off but some power supplies
will have modular cables and will also
have all black cables like these so that
they just look a little bit cleaner and
they don't stand out as much when you've
built your system moving on to talk
about motherboards and I have CPUs also
right here because there's a very close
relationship between the CPU you get and
the motherboard you got to make sure
that they are compatible and here's
where you get to make that age-old
decision AMD or Intel because Andy makes
CPUs Intel makes CPUs and you got to get
a compatible motherboard for an Intel
CPU a compatible motherboard for an AMD
CPU they are not swappable in any way
shape or form in fact the CPUs
themselves are different Intel uses LGA
on these mainstream boards AMD uses PGA
I have a separate video on the
difference between those if you want to
check it out but every motherboard is
gonna have these basic features first a
socket at the center where your CPU gets
installed you want to be careful with
that it can be delicate next to that we
have these long vertical slots that's
for memory you can have two slot
motherboards I recommend trying to get a
four slot one because you're probably
going to start out with two sticks of
memory and you have expansion space for
adding two more in the future if you
start with four slots most mini ITX
boards only have two slots because
that's all there's room for that is one
of the sacrifices you make by going with
mini ITX
you're also gonna have places to connect
up power from your power supply usually
a larger 24-pin power and then a smaller
either 4 or 8 pin power up in the top
left right
here's where you have power delivery
componentry for the cpu and if you're
looking into overclocking that's
something you want to pay attention to
and double check the reviews for your
given motherboard most motherboards will
be able to run any CPU it's compatible
with at stock frequencies but having
better power delivery is important for
overclocking and the bottom left you
have expansion slots these are typically
called PCI Express and you'll want at
least one full sized by 16 one for
installing a graphics card to a full
sized ATX motherboard gives you
additional slots as well though so for
instance a 2-way graphics card setup or
perhaps expansion cards for video
capture or adding more USB ports beyond
that you will have ports to connect up
your storage drive via SATA ports over
on the side or MDOT 2 slots this board
has one of them right here there's
another one beneath the heatsink down
here and then along the right edge and
the bottom you'll have other
connectivity for stuff like USB 3.1 gen2
front panel connectors fan headers for
connecting up fans USB 3 front panel
audio RGB headers not going to get into
too much detail on those but they are
things you want to take a look at if
you're concerned about connecting for
example an addressable RGB LED strip so
at this point you're probably like
alright Paul I got a reasonable idea of
what's going on with the motherboard
itself
what installs where I know about the
form factors small medium or large Mini
ITX micro ATX standard ATX and I know I
want to get the right socket for the CPU
I'm choosing LGA 1151 for modern eighth
and ninth gen Intel CPUs and socket am 4
for AMD rise and 1000 series or 2000
series CPUs or ap use but what are all
these other numbers on the box is Z 390
here on the Intel boxes we have B 350 M
and X 470 they're for MSI those are for
the chipsets a chipset is an extra chip
sits on the motherboard that helps the
CPU handle additional IO so you might
have additional PCIe slots or MDOT 2
slots or SATA slots that go through the
chipset and then that communicates back
to the CPU so you can connect up drives
unfortunately Intel and AMD have been in
kind of a branding battle when it comes
to their chipsets they're all really
similarly named and it's very confusing
which one is which so pay more attention
to the sockets first of all then look at
the chipset and just know that right now
for Intel you want Z 390 or Z 370 if
you're getting an unlocked processor and
you want over
clock you can save some money by getting
lower end chipsets but definitely Z 390
or Z 370 if you are getting an unlocked
overclocking processor which is one of
the nice things you should get with
Intel over that costs a bit more and
then for AMD I would recommend a B 450
chipset motherboards simply because that
still allows overclocking they're not
going to be as expensive as the x4 70
motherboards and you still have
backwards compatibility with
first-generation Rison you will know you
have compatibility with rise in 1000
2000 series and honestly the main
benefits you get with going with x4 70
over B 450 are the ability to do two-way
graphics card setups which honestly most
people never bother with if you're
shopping online for a motherboard i
recommend using pc part picker and
choosing your processor first the Rison
v 2600 is a really really nice mid-range
165 dollar processor from AMD once
you've chosen that it's got a
compatibility feature so if you go to
try to choose a motherboard it will only
show you compatible boards from there
you can drill down to stuff like the
form factors so we want ATX and I
recommended the B 450 chipset so we'll
choose that as well and then here we can
see compatible B 450 motherboards listed
between a price of about 94 dollars all
the way up to 140 dollars if you want a
recommendation for me right now this MSI
B 450 tomahawk is a solid board with
some RGB LED features but also has
really good power delivery so if you're
gonna overclock there in the future
you'd be set and you can't of course do
the same thing with intel intel has
really fast processors I gotta give them
that but they tend to be more expensive
so their current flagship on the
mainstream side is the I $9.99 hundred K
which cost about 500 bucks that's a lot
more than the AMD option but we can also
go to choose a motherboard here and then
again it would list us compatible boards
but just reality check here because it's
listing this be 360 gigabyte motherboard
as compatible the B 360 chipset from
Intel limits you as far as your
connectivity and it also doesn't allow
you to overclock so that's really a bad
choice of motherboard to pair with
something like a 9900 K but if we again
use our filters here to just choose z3
70 and z3 and 90 those would allow
overclocking then we can sort by price
and get ourselves some more reasonable
options here now you'll notice some less
expensive
boards that are compatible here chances
are these aren't going to have the
greatest power delivery so you're
probably not going to be a
overclock quite as well although on the
AMD side I was able to get away with a
maybe 100 to 120 dollar range
motherboard and still do some
overclocking I would probably want to go
more towards the hundred and fifty
dollar range to get yourself a solid
Intel motherboard and maybe even up
towards 200 if you're looking for some
more advanced features now let's talk
about the CPU potentially one of the
more expensive parts of your builds may
be eclipsed by the graphics card
depending on what graphics card you get
but again we're talking about mainstream
CPUs from AMD and the write and Intel on
the left and if you're just looking at
the bottom of the CPU from Intel for
example whether this is a $500 9900 K or
like one of their $80 dual cores they're
gonna look exactly the same on the
bottom because they have the same pin
count their LGA 1151 so they have 1151
contacts down there on the bottom same
goes for AMD whether you're talking
about an entry-level $100 part or their
flagship 2700 X it'll look the exact
same from the bottom you'll only be able
to tell what it is by looking at the
actual label labeling on the CPU itself
I also want to point out that these are
not all of the consumer CPUs available
there's also stuff like Rison thread
ripper from AMD then Intel also has
their LGA 2066 stuff these are called
prosumer or high-end desktop chips and
I'm only showing them to point out that
they exist not going to touch on them
much in this video because they're much
more expensive so if you're just
learning how to build a PC you should
start out with the mainstream platform
stuff so beyond that how do you choose
you're mainly going to be looking at the
core count of a processor the thread
count of the processor where it takes
the number of cores and actually
provides twice the number of threads
available to the operating system to use
for calculating stuff and then finally
the frequency that the CPU runs at and
when you're comparing CPUs of the same
generation and architecture a higher
frequency CPU will be faster I'll talk
about pricing and decision making in
just a second but the only other thing
you want to concern yourself with is
whether or not your CPU comes with a
heat sink fan if you buy an Intel CPU
that's not a case Q on the end so if you
get the 8700 it will come with a stock
heatsink fan these are usually adequate
so you can get some benefits but
upgrading them but you can at least get
up and running with that almost all
current AMD AM 4 processors do come with
a heat sink fan of some variety they
have different sizes of them of them
depending on how expensive the CPU is
that you buy and they're actually pretty
decent the Wraith stealth and the rates
so again if you're just getting up and
running out off the ground and you want
to save some money you can totally just
go with the included heat sink fan that
comes with your AMD CPU so back to
pricing for a CPU starting on the AMD
side so I've chosen a b4 15 motherboard
I'm now going to choose a CPU so the
compatibility filter will only show me
compatible CPUs on PC part picker and
here we can see that 465 bucks we got
that rise in 520 600 I think this is the
best bang for your buck CPU right now at
a reasonable price that 165 bucks
because you get six cores and twelve
threads it does have simultaneous
multi-threading it comes with a heat
sink fan in the box and it's completely
unlocked for overclocking so you can
overclock this if you so desire another
stand up for me from AMD is the Rison
320 200 G again this is that APU but you
can get by without a graphics card with
this and get it for as little as $92 but
usually about 95 or 100 this is a quad
core CPU without SMT so you only get
four cores and four threads but it's a
hundred bucks and you don't have to buy
a graphics card if you want a lot of
processing power than you want more
cores so getting an eight core on this
platform from AMD you can actually get
as cheap as 170 dollars to the rise in
seven 1700 I think the 2600 is a little
bit better as a gaming CPU but you can
also get the eight core 1700 X or even
the eight core 2700 for about 260
dollars if we compare that to what's
available over on the intel side you
will note that for a six core locked
Intel processor you have to pay a
hundred and eighty five dollars for the
current gen unlocked six core from until
you have to pay two hundred and sixty
dollars and this does not have
multi-threading or hyper threading as
intel calls it still six cores and six
threads if you want what is in my
opinion the equivalent of the unlock 6
core with multi-threading from AMD from
Intel you got to go to the i7 8700 K
which still costs 350 to 400 dollars and
that is last generation still a very
good CPU but their current generation
replacement is the 9700 K which can get
for 410 dollars which is an 8 core
unlock CPU but it does not have hyper
threading for all of the goodness and
speed possible on the intel side right
now on the main stream platform you got
to go at the I 999 hundred K which is a
cores and unlock and is a very fast and
capable processor mind you but it's 500
bucks so you got to pay for that
performance let's move on to system at
memory system memory come
and these sticks often called dims dual
inline memory module is what dim stands
for and memory is pretty simple there
are no moving parts so that's easy
enough you know pretty difficult to
damage if you drop them or anything all
you really need to be concerned about
with memory is what version you're
getting and anything in the past 2 years
is going to use ddr4 not ddr3 this is a
ddr4 module on the top and ddr3 on the
bottom you'll note that the notches here
and not in the same place so it's
actually pretty much impossible to
install a ddr3 module into ddr4 slot and
then you have two main specs you want to
look at one is the capacity or how much
actual space is in each memory stick you
usually will see a listed amount of
memory per stick so this is originally a
4 gig by 4 set up so they were 4 4 gig
games for 16 gigs total and then you
have 2 ratings for the speed one is
what's usually called memory speed
itself so DDR for this is ddr4 3200
higher is better you'll see 3,000 speed
3200 speed 3400 up to 4000 speed these
speeds that you can get for reasonable
prices right now that are also good
speeds are about 3000 or 3,200 and
finally you'll have a CL rating that's
known as caste latency that is the
latency or how many clock cycles it
takes for the memory to do a specific
job lower is better when it comes to
that number so caste latency 14 is
better than caste latency 16 and when it
comes to the cpu you've chosen you also
want to make sure your memory will play
nice with that Rison likes higher speed
memory so I usually recommend 3,000 or
3,200 speed memory width for a rise in
CPU and you'll have better luck getting
your memory to run at that rated speed
if you get memory that listed as
compatible with rising or just double
check your motherboards memory
compatibility list you should be able to
find that on your motherboard
manufacturers website they'll have
specific kits that they've tested at
specific speeds and they'll tell you yes
it will work with your cpu intel cpus
tend to be a little bit more flexible
when it comes to memory i still
recommend higher speed if you can afford
it but usually you can get away with 26
66 or 3,000 all that said if you can
find memory that's just a couple bucks
more that's on the faster rated speed I
recommend going for it but don't spend
20 or 30 dollars to jump from 3200 to
3400 for example finally I recommend
buying your memory in a matched set just
so you can plug it in and make sure that
it will play nice together dual channel
kit is just fine for getting you up and
running on the mainstream platform you
can also get quad
matched kits as well that you may or may
not be interested in usually those are
for the high end desktop platform and
then what is all the rage right now is
RGB lighting on everything right so
you'll find some memory that has RGB
lighting across the top that is purely
aesthetic does not make your memory any
faster so again don't spend a bunch of
money on RGB memory go for faster memory
first but you know if the same gets
available with RGB and not and you
prefer RGB and it's the same price and
go for it you know it's not gonna hurt
your performance either and when it
comes to graphics cards I could easily
do a full video by itself on choosing
graphics cards the difference between
AMD and NVIDIA who are the two main GPU
makers and the pros and cons and price
range and everything but I'm gonna try
to keep this simple since this is
already a fairly long video with
graphics cards you get what you pay for
if you pay more money you're gonna get
more GPU performance if you want to game
in 1920 by 1080 you can get away with a
graphics card in the 150 to 300 dollar
range if you want to play at 1440 you
probably want to spend 250 to 400
dollars and if you want to go upwards
beyond that to 4k or some of the ultra
wide screen resolutions and you probably
want to spend a 500 bucks plus on your
GPU I'll make a couple notes on
compatibility and then go into some
recommendations for you when it comes to
physical compatibility as long as you
have a modern GPU uses PCI Express it
slots into the top PCI Express slot
usually on your motherboard and you're
gonna have pretty much universal
compatibility it's just like that that's
how it works when it comes to the GPU
itself physically usually the length of
the GPU this way can sometimes be a
conflict if you have a shorter case most
cases listed the GPU length that they're
compatible with and that's also
something that PC part picker keeps in
mind if you're picking out a GPU there
and then you might want to keep an eye
on the height or width I guess depending
on how you hold the graphics card as
well some cases don't have as much space
horizontally and in fact this case is
one of the ones where if you have a big
fat GPU and like a water block on it
that has more stuff sticking off of it
you can potentially conflict with the
glass part right there that's less of a
concern but something you should keep
keep an eye on especially if you're
buying one of these over Bilt's
aftermarket third-party designs this is
a gigabyte Oris r-tx 2080 TI
so if you're looking in the low to mid
range say 200 to $300 price range I
would recommend on the Nvidia side the
geforce gtx 1066 gig or on the AMD side
the RX 588
or the rx 598 gig if he can claw your
way up to the 350 to $400 range I was
formerly recommending AMD's Radeon Vega
56 or Vega 64 if you could find them in
stock and at reasonable prices
however NVIDIA has just recently
launched the r-tx 2060 for three hundred
and fifty dollars between the two if you
can get a really good deal on a Vega 56
or 64 still go for that but the r-tx
2060 whether you're talking about the
founders Edition or any of the
third-party versions that's what I would
go for there if you can spend five
hundred bucks go for an RT X 2060 if you
can spend seven hundred bucks go for an
RT X twenty eighty if you can spend a
thousand to fourteen hundred dollars I
guess maybe consider the RT X twenty
atti but honestly that is a lot of money
to spend especially if you're just
building a system for the first time
it's the best gaming graphics card you
can get it's just more money than a lot
of people spend on their entire computer
so you know spend the money that you
have don't go into debt over something
like this and the last component I'm
going to talk about is storage
unfortunately storage is really flexible
apart from your main operating system
drive that's you'll want to pay
attention to from the get-go because
when you first set up your system you're
gonna want to install probably windows
on it if you're building a gaming PC
Linux is totally fine - for people who
like that I'll be covering that
procedure in part three of this video
but suffice it to say what you want to
start out with is a single fast SSD
preferably an MDOT two nvme one right
now if you can afford it but if you
can't you can easily save twenty or
thirty bucks by just going with a SATA
SSD like this one these little MDOT two
drives are really nice because you just
installed them directly to your
motherboard you don't have to worry
about running cables over from your SATA
ports or powering it via an extra plug
coming over from your power supply and
although most people aren't gonna take
advantage of the speed that you get from
a higher-end nvme MDOT - SSD they can
get much much faster than these SATA
drives the SATA drives typically top out
about 500 to 550 megabytes per second
read and write speeds
whereas nvme drives can go to 2,000 or
3,000 and beyond so back over on PC part
picker - look at storage this time and
I'm going to drill down to just look at
SSDs and to see what the best deals are
I'm sorting by price per gigabyte and
just over ten cents per gig is what you
can get an SSD for right now so that
means you can get 480 gig SSDs for about
50 bucks you can get one terabyte SSDs
for about $100 you can even get 240
drives for maybe about 25 to 30 dollars
so if you're really on a budget that's
what I would go with to get yourself
started out for most people a 500 gig
class drive for about 50 bucks would be
just fine and if we go down here and
look just for MDOT 220 280 drives we can
potentially start looking at some nvme
options just keep in mind not all MDOT
two drives are nvme for instance this WD
blue drive is a SATA 3 drive so it's
still only gonna top out at about 560
megabytes per second sequential reads
530 megabytes second per second
sequential writes this Intel 660 p2 tire
but actually is an nvme drive so this
will get you sequential reads and writes
it closer to 18 hundred megabytes per
second and this is nvme so tons of good
options here when it comes to SSDs to
get your operating system drive loaded
up - I would just recommend if you're
looking at standard SATA drives just
take a look at what some of these nvme
drives are in the same price range and
you might find that some of them are
pretty reasonable and sometimes we're
spending the extra 15 or 20 bucks to get
them before I close out this video

Squarespace for sponsoring my youtube
channel so that is part one of my
three-part series on how to build a
computer in 2019 I hope you guys have
enjoyed it and maybe learned a little
bit more about how computer gets put
together these days and of course
remember those three key things decide
how big your computer wants to be decide
how powerful you want your computer to
be and then those should probably
determine how much you can spend on your
computer of course you can also do it
the other way figure out how
much money at first and then drill down
to figure out how much you can spend on
the computer itself but if you would
like some more guidance with putting
your own PC together definitely check
out my monthly build series at the
beginning of every month I do a couple
PC builds partly based on price points
or specific use cases and there you will
find full lists of my recommendations on
how to build a PC for 600 bucks or a
thousand bucks or just however much you
happen to have on you right at the
moment thank you guys so much for
watching this video definitely hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it links
are in the description too a lot of the
stuff I talked about today as well as
the PC part picker who has a great site
for helping choose your own PC parts and
let me know what you think of this video
in the comment section down below if you
have any suggestions I'd love to hear
them thanks again for watching guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
