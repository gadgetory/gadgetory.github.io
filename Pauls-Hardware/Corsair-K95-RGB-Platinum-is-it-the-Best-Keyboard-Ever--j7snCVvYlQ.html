platinum mechanical gaming keyboard and
right now it represents the best
mechanical gaming keyboard that Corsair
can make with their best switches and
the best features and of course their
most expensive price at ten hundred
dollars us why does it cost two hundred
dollars well let me tell you all the
things that it has first Cherry MX
speeds which is already detailed upon
their introduction in my Corsair k70
rapid-fire video I'll link that up in
the corner they have 45 gram actuation
force one point two millimeter actuation
distance and if these switches are too
fast for you thankfully they'll also
have the k95 platinum with Cherry MX
brown switches - those have two
millimeter actuation distance so you
don't have to push them down a little
bit further for them to actually
register the keys are all individually
lit and querque programmable with
coursers cue software they've also added
a nineteen zone fully programmable light
edge sort of edge of light along the top
do note the smooth color transitions
along that with minimal hot spotting
which of course there was pretty proud
to point out at CES the k95 platy is
also available in black worldwide like
the one that you see here or if you're
buying in north america you can get it
in gunmetal the regional restriction for
that one is only at launch though so
then of course there if you want to know
when that gunmetal finish will go global
it has an anodized brushed aluminum
frame that's one solid piece across the
top so it's lightweight and strong with
the whole keyboard weighing one point
three one kilograms or two point eight
eight pounds Corsair has kept the USB
pass-through just like on the k70 RGB
which I like but although the keyboard
itself requires a USB 3.0 plug the
pass-through unfortunately is only USB
2.0 the macro keys from the previous k95
are still there but it's reduced to a
single row of six programmable GTS with
textured key caps you can assign single
keystrokes or complex multi key combos
to these with the Corsair utility engine
software accessories include
documentation of course info on a
two-year warranty a key cap puller and a
set of textured and contoured
replacement key caps WASD for FPS
players and wer TDS for MOBA games
another nice accessory is the wrist rest
which is full-length and detachable
with
dual sided magnetic pad with a soft
touch finish you can flip over if you
want textured or a non textured feel a
new feature on the other side of the
keyboard provides crisp cross cable
management channels which most likely
will be used for a headset it's great to
use if you have like a USB headset that
you can plug into that USB pastor and
then route underneath but it did also
remind me that there's no headphone and
mic analog pass through on the k95
platinum okay missing feature
rounding out the features though we have
100% anti-ghosting with full key
rollover while connected via USB and
shame on you somehow use an adapter and
plug this into a ps2 port by the way
we've moved on from that as well as a
braided fiber cable nice and thick with
two plugs one for the keyboard and one
for the USB pass-through and now on to
the RGB LEDs and the software so first
you've got onboard storage you actually
get 8 megabytes of profile storage built
in with 3 profiles that are accessible
those will store your Hardware macro as
well as lighting effects there's a
32-bit ARM Cortex processor that handles
the onboard flash storage and the LED
display controllers that are integrated
so all this means that you can save any
backlighting effects that you set up
even the more complicated ones and the
multi-level in-game macros to the
onboard memory in three different
profiles and unplug the keyboard and
take them with you without the need to
install the Q software on the system
that you move the keyboard to that's
pretty cool
that cortex processor in there is also
nice and fast so the software updates
that you do in the software right to the
keyboard was pretty much no wait time at
all unless you're doing a firmware
update and that only takes a few seconds
the Q software has come a long way and
you can also use it to control and sync
Corsair headsets and mice and even mouse
pads and I like that they've separated
the Advanced section so it's a little
bit less daunting for new users the
complexity of the software was a bit of
a barrier to entry for new people it
will prompt you to update firmware when
available when you plug the keyboard in
and it detects it and then macros can be
set up in the Actions menu while
lighting effects are available in the
lighting effects section cool looking
effects presets can be selected such as
rainbow spiral rainbow wave color shift
visor rain and more and there's reactive
modes as well so you can type and it
reacts to your typing or your system
sound they're also available to you can
also download community made
configurations which is great for
finding new
lighting configurations and you can
stack modes on top of each other such as
layering the Weiser effect over rainbow
wave for example which leads to some
pretty unique combinations also you can
control the light edge along the top
individually if you prefer to have it
separate from the lighting that's going
on with the keys I haven't mentioned
them yet but there are also six
dedicated multimedia Keys here on the
top right those are still there
including a nicely textured volume
roller and the backlighting for these
buttons is also RGB along with the
windows lock key which is over here and
there's also brightness and profile
switches on the top-left all those have
RGB in them you can control them all and
synchronize them with the RGB that's
going on with the rest of the keys on
the board gray so on the plus side the
k95 platinum definitely brings together
a sweet spot collection of features for
a mechanical gaming keyboard that stands
out a bit from Corsairs previous
offerings
I like the updates quickly and the
software is also very robust now and I
didn't even delve into the advanced
settings for this video the USB
pass-through is very nice to have and I
still like the design of these keyboards
with the flat metal aluminum backplate
being fairly easy to clean with the key
caps removed my critiques here are
mostly centered around the fact that
this is called platinum and that Corsair
said it was the best ever keyboard that
they ever made and could possibly have
made I do see a couple areas that could
be improved first off that USB
pass-through could be USB 3.0 or even
USB 3.1 compatible which would be nice
since this are a USB 3 requirement to
use the keyboard fully and I would like
to be able to plug in my high-speed
storage there for quick and easy access
for like USB drives I also do like a mic
and headphones pass-through on a
keyboard which would be convenient and
it will align with those cable routing
channels that they added on the bottom
of the board and finally I'd say that
the Cherry MX speed switches aren't
necessarily for everyone they're just a
little bit too easy to miss type
sometimes with their really low travel
distance for registering a keystroke so
I'm glad that there's an MX Brown option
but it would be nice to see them ad
blues and Red's available as well for
people who like the switch types that is
all for this video though guys thank you
so much for watching and let me know
what you think of course there's newest
keyboard in the comment section below
is this worth $200 to you I'm sure
Corsair would like to know also of
course hit the like button subscribe
