welcome to Taipei Taiwan and my free
Computex video copy text hasn't started
yet it starts tomorrow on Tuesday
right now it's Monday and I had an idea
why don't I hit up one of the vendors
that I know and see if I could maybe get
in early maybe give you guys a sneak
peek at what Computex has in store and
you know what gigabyte said okay and
they're always located right here in
Taipei 101 so I'm going to wander in
there see what they have going on and I
will share that with you guys that's
kind of how this works
so let's go I have made my way inside
and of course I think I might always has
excellent digs here at Taipei 101
everything is still getting set up
people are cleaning there's there's a
bunch of vacuums going and stuff but I'm
excited to be one of the first people to
get in here to check out these xc-99
boards cause obviously if you guys
weren't already where xc-99 that's what
it's all about
for this week for gigabyte at least for
now we're on that later but let's go
after this 4x 290x 299 UD for the ug
series ultra durable is the mainstay
from gigabyte stable of motherboards and
as you can see this one is pretty much
outfitted with all the basics that you
would want an X to ninety-nine board
you've got all eight bins every flaw
channel memory to support your Intel 4x
series processors and it's got an ads
media 331 42 additional USB 3.1 gen2
chip on there with all the PCIe lanes
that are available on the core X series
of processors from Intel there is just a
ton of peripheral connectivity and
really a high speed stuff that you can
connect up here so additional USB 3.1 is
something that you're going to be
forming a lot here's a quick look at the
i/o on the back but beyond that you're
also going to be seeing tons of
connectivity for stuff like SSDs nvme
and so we're mostly seeing MDOT to
support here for from gigabyte but this
board actually provides you with two one
here right above the main PCI Express
slot and then one right here in below it
beyond that you've got standard PCI
Express layout of course there's going
to be some different configuration
since with these boards depending on
which CPU slot in there so I'm not going
to delve into that right now it's a
little bit too complex to sort of
explain away in a single video but this
is going to be sort of we'll call this a
starting out point from the gigabyte if
you want a solid board one that is going
to work for you for a long time
and not essentially super blingy they
either you can have a little bit of LED
lighting here along the edge but none of
the RGB stuff that we're going to be
showing you in just a minute with the
higher-end boards but tons of high-end
features RGB fusion supports because you
do have an RGB W header on there if you
want to add some strips you got smart
fans five features so you can do a fan
stop mode for your fans as well as
hybrid fan headers that can support PWM
or voltage control here are the fancy
Horus branded boards I'm going to be
talking about four of these these are
these 270 so don't worry about those we
got the ultra gaming right here we got
the gaming three the gaming five in the
gaming seven if you're wondering how
these all stack up it's probably to be
something like the gaming 3 then that ug
4 bar boards that I just showed you then
the ultra then a gaming 5 and then the
gaming 7 well start with the gaming 3
right over here if you want a norris
board that has gaming in the name which
means it's meant for gaming you can use
it for other stuff too that's okay but
you want some RGB s on there you also
want a little bit of additional
expandability you're still going to have
to m dot to slothfulness pretty much in
the same position that you saw on the UD
force so you're going to get some of the
additional features that gigabyte offers
such as steel-reinforced n+ along here a
couple of cerium for students plus for a
single or dual card configuration and
then you also have pretty standard-issue
power delivery on this main 24 pin and a
single 8 pin but you're going to have of
course all a DIMM slots for up to 128
gigs of memory and then of course you
got a couple LEDs
not a ton hot overkill but a bit of an
access lighting on the again these two
dim plus I'm sorry these PCIe slots as
well as our course logo on the chipset
damnit
moving onto the X $2.99 or ultra gaming
right here and this seems to me to
become a nice midpoint it's not going to
be super towards the high end like the
gaming 5 in the gaming 7 would be but
you still get tons of awesome features
so you're going to get a an additional m
dot 2 slot you have the 2 again in the
same positions above and below the
graphics card they've added an
additional one down here it's actually
kind of part of the chipset this one
actually includes a cooler on there as
well it is a fairly substantial heatsink
not just a steel piece of metal or
something like that and there is some
actual thermal material on the back
there or like a thermal pad to make sure
that you're going to get some heat
dissipation from your SSD if you're
putting a high-end nvme SSD in there
again you have an as media 3142 USB 3.1
gen2 controller to give you additional
connectivity for USB including both type
a and type C ports that are over here on
the rear i/o and if you're looking at
the LEDs on this board and you notice
that they look pretty significantly
different from some of the LED
implementations we've seen from gigabyte
in the past that is because they're
digital they've gone with digital LED
and that allows them to actually
individually control them so a couple of
the other boards you can see some of the
effects I'll show you in just a second
but that will also let you control
digital LED and RGB W scripts so you
have a header RGB W header at the bottom
of the board right here and then the
next board up that we're going to show
you in the spec also has a digital RGB
LED header which is pretty cool as well
bit of beefed up power delivery at the
top I would assume just because we got
dual eight pin CPU supplemental power
connectors there is another W RGB header
up here at the top as well and then this
one is obviously decked out with a lot
more LEDs you have an accent along I owe
you have they did sort of end they put
LEDs kind of an end of the PJ each box
here soon as they kind of shoot across
the side they got an either side it
gives a much smoother look I feel like
for those LEDs in particular then you
have the LEDs running up and down in
between the dim clock and of course the
accent on the on the chipset let's talk
about the Horus gaming seven I think I
called this the Auris gaming five a
second ago it's the seventh sorry about
that we got seven and a nine coming up
next so for these here you're going to
get more and getting more more stuff
again
3m twos on this one one two and three
you get the heatsink at the bottom one
there again that integrates very nicely
with that chipset heatsink on the gaming
seven you do get support for 3-way
configurations for graphics cards 3-way
SLI or 3-way crossfire again you get the
smart fan features as well as the
additional connector down here at the
bottom so you can add W RGB LEDs or you
have that digital header so you can
actually add digital LED strips or
they're talking about the possibility of
like a digital camera so you can add on
there you can actually program in to do
logos or that kind of thing so I'm kind
of excited and curious to see how that
might work but what I really like the
C's board is just with digital LEDs have
sort of a difference in more distinct
look and I think it looks quite a bit
cleaner we've seen on the previous Horus
boards from the prior generation and
then this one's kind of go a little
haywire right now but you can see sort
of how you might be able to do some
programming with the digital LEDs for
this trip that goes from the bottom to
the top view or the top from the bottom
depending on before you look at it
finally here's the X 299 or gaming nine
this one has additional as media 31:42
USB 3.1 gen2 with frets and rear USB
type-c so that means that this board on
the gaming nine the gaming seven has
this as well has that USB 3.1 front
panel header so if your case just
compatible with it some cases are a bit
being access them and you should see
more adoption that header in the future
you can get yourself panel USB and it's
just a way better connector types in the
old-school USB 3.0 one as well that was
all big and bulky and they've also had a
killer doubleshot nic to this as well as
intel gigabit ethernet lan and then of
course at the RGB fusion pretty much
similar layouts as far as RGB LEDs to
the gaming seven
over here I'm going to take this one off
the shelf so we have an integrated IO
shield right there so you will never
again forget to install your i/o shield
of course we have an inclusion of a USP
I plead to the point one right there
this has a BIOS feature you can plot you
can update the BIOS without needing a
CPU or memory plugged in awesome awesome
feature can rescue you in the case of a
on BIOS update just like that can also
give any greater des you tell anything
Wi-Fi back here and then a pretty cool
feature on the back of this board you
have and some armor plating you have the
back plate which also looks pretty cool
got the fourth logo on there and this is
great if you have a completely tempered
glass case that's my opinion on these or
if you're building your systems like on
a table it's nice just to be able to set
the board down and not worry about
potentially damaging any resemblence
components on the back so a good job
gigabyte with these forest x 299 boards
they also have a wood station board
let's take let's take a look at that so
guys I'm going to be honest I really
don't know too much about what Intel has
in store for their xeon lineup that's
going to slot into LGA 22 2016 6
motherboards but gigabyte is ready for
it with the GAC 422 WS this workstation
board that they have right here so this
is the V 422 chipset base it is not
going to support the X the core x-series
of CPU storm Intel so this is going to
require a V on chip but that doesn't
mean it's sure to support ECC memory and
if you want like a no-nonsense board
without any LEDs on it or anything like
that it seems like it's going to be the
board for you ehe X form factor tons and
tons of connectivity that's going to
have support for 4-way
GPU configurations on a workstation
that's probably going to be more suited
to something like a Tesla or Quadro
setup or something like that for doing
GPU rendering but absolutely massive
amounts of connectivity and horsepower
you have able to connect to that and
again I have no idea of any of the
actual CPUs earnest volunteer so as far
as core counts PCIe lane counts or
anything like that
if anybody gets but I did want to give
you guys a quick look at the story
because especially
to her in IT space or like doing
enterprise stuff having an actual really
sexy looking workstation board this is
all about horsepower and given step them
at the gas 80 gigabyte wanted me to
check out this little device apparently
has one at a Computex design and
innovation award this is the gigabyte
bricks VR which you might have seen us
cover sort of briefly before they've
shown us sort of a tall version of the
bricks like this in the past but this
one is a finished product that's a gtx
1060 inside as well as an i7 7700 HQ it
can also support a couple m dot two
devices in there for storage so that's
pretty cool that imagine you could use
this as a normal computer not just for
VR but they I imagine once the show gets
underway that again they're still doing
a bunch of setup here we'll have a VR
demo going on with this they have it
currently connected to an oculus rift
and if you apparently want to play VR
but you don't have much space then you
can go for the brics VR the the product
name is B&amp;amp;I 7 HD 6 - 1060 great for
those of you very curious alright guys I
think I'm running at a time that giving
me dirty looks because they have not
finished everything they need to finish
and I have to give them time but I
really quickly wanted to show you guys
some of these graphics cards or its
branded gigabyte graphics cards that's
an Rx 570 right there this is an rx 580
and the XP r 8g from also from there or
series and then we also have a gtx 980ti
extreme gaming edition i just did a
review on the non extreme version of
this card did a very good job here in
the back we've also got a 1050 TI a 1060
mini and the geforce gtx 1078 g but
that's the blower style fan version keep
an eye on this 1060 right here and how
big it is because there's a 1070 version
of that that i'm going to show you just
a second worse also the gaming chassis
which I was surprised I didn't know
that's something that they were delving
into this is AC 300w gaming chassis
which includes Oris and rs cooler and a
norris graphics card and apparently you
can get Oris everything these days
I think there's I don't even know if
those power supplies or their power
supplies
there isn't there's a Norris power
supply being told so make an entire ORS
computer I guess is a I'm kind of say
okay off okay this is the Auris gtx 1070
gaming box look how tiny it is basically
you get a gtx 1070 it comes
pre-installed you get this tiny little
box which includes the power and then it
is connected via thunderbolts in the
back so all you need is a thunderbolt
compatible computer and you can take
something like a laptop connect this up
externally and you can game on your
laptop with an external graphics card
now these have been around of course
before we've seen stuff like the Razer
core and other variants of that but I
certainly have never seen one that's
quite this tiny and also quite this
strangely lit but there it is that is
the Auris gtx 1070 gaming box so guys
that is all the time I have for now here
at the gigabyte offices at Taipei 101 of
course I have my whole week of Computex
coverage ahead of me so I'd like to say
a huge thank you to gigabyte for helping
to sponsor this video for me to come out
early and give you guys a sneak peek of
what they have in store for Computex
they have more stuff that's still coming
so I didn't even get the chance to see
it also I know Kyle's going to be coming
by here so check out his channel he's
are going to be doing Computex coverage
all week as well and I imagine I might
even stop back by here later in the week
because they told me there might be some
more stuff in the works that they can't
talk about yet but more on that in the
future hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed this video stay tuned to my
channel subscribe if you want to see
more country text coverage from here in
Taipei Taiwan thanks again for watching
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
