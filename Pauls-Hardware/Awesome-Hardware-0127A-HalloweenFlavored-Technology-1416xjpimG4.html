started the circle is complete
everything is proceeding as I have
foreseen you've come here seeking
knowledge technology you'll find only
dead Oh God that mean I'm gonna die I
have other than winter is coming that's
all I got
brace yourselves ah yeah
where's your third Kyle not even the
white walkers will be a match for you um
I left my sword at my friend's house yes
cue evil laugh Jesus you've been working
on that laugh so you're so scary in here
if the only thing I can do well welcome
everyone - awesome hardware it's a live
show about technology that we do every
Tuesday and as Tuesday this year landed
on October 31st what are the odds this
is the Halloween edition of Awesome
hardware hold on - thanks that's not
very Halloween oh yes great so Kyle and
I are in costume I hope all of you are
as well
we're going to drink a few beers and
talk about technology occasionally we
use adult language sorry about that but
if you defends you please watch
something else I'm a Boston I
don't know why I feel like I'm talking
with an accent all of a sudden but yeah
we stream the first half to my channel
Paul's hardware and this episode number
127 side a and in about an hour we'll
switch over to Kyle's half on his
channel bit weights yes
wonderful wonderful system that we have
lined up here before we proceed too far
a quick plug for our retail stores if
you'd like to buy a merchandise its
high-quality and it we shout out your
name at the end of the show here's all
the things I'm selling they're all
wonderful they're all good things and
buying them will make you a more
intelligent person yep in every way
imaginable Kyle's store my store by the
way is Paul's hardware net Kyle's store
is bit wit tech slash store we have some
some awesome Hardware themed merch and
other things to please buy things buy
them all
it gives us money yep and you get
fantastic merchandise indeed all right
do we do we even say who we were just
just in case some people have no idea I
thought that would be evident yeah be
very obvious but they're people make
guesses yes we did have a few correct
guesses in the crowd that's good so just
to confirm yes Paul is a Sith Lord I am
Darth Paul Darth Paul good I like that
name a lot and I am Jon Snow of
Winterfell
you know nothing I but I'm but I have
glasses on so I'm nerdy Jon I'm bookworm
Jon Snow so I know everything so he is
he knows something I guess you know
something Jon Snow I know something that
you don't ha ha spoilers yep that's
that's all season 8 right there we also
drink beer I think I mentioned that but
I'm drinking a figural Manta Mountain
Brewing Company Danish red that I picked
up by Heather right Heather got these
Heather Cal's wife why take a wife saw
snakes wifey thanks for joining us
tonight especially if you're enjoying
mmm Halloween maybe you're watching this
as small children or medium-size
children are coming to your door large
child for candy we have candy we do yay
trick-or-treat for us
oh my goodness heat we got rhesus I'm
gonna have me a KitKat and whenever you
get dig in those whoppers to you never
you get a candy multi pack like this
it's bad news there's always like a nice
array of candy but there's always one
that's less crappy Kinsmen as one candy
tickets left it's like that it ends up
like at the end of the bag there's most
of that candy left it's so it's the
biostar I'm trying to figure out what it
was for this for this mix what do you
think it is oh yeah here we have heath
bar that's that's a solid one
we got Reese's obviously cups yep we got
the whoppers can't knock whopper
mothballs they're safe
we got the Kit Kat Kit Kats of course
another classic and we got new york
peppermint pattie that's the shitty one
that's spot on there that's clean one no
needs now I'm not gonna trash anyone for
enjoying a york peppermint pattie but
look at this array of candy here most of
it features chocolate combined with
something yeah that makes the chocolate
it enhances the chocolate yes
peppermint I mean maybe it's it's a
foreshadowing of Christmas I suppose
what even is peppermint it's it's got
the word mint in it mint is a vegetable
though and yeah I feel like that has
green it doesn't belong in candy correct
no york peppermint pattie
mhm person my personal favorite heat in
here is the whopping oh yeah and I like
all of them equally yeah like my
children
children I love you all the same okay
you bastards let's move into some
technology no what are we doing first
we're doing how the Navy Yard where whoo
this is a forward-looking addition of a
heavy hardware because most of this is
stuff that either has just launched or
has just been announced we're gonna
start off with team red AMD and rise in
mobile Mobile risin you can now get rise
in in your mobile phone what what why
why would you need that to lie I was
lying to you okay good I'm a Sith Lord
remember hmm we're evil your deception
is on point
now rise in mobile is aimed EAP use
which includes
Zen based CPU packages that makes more
sense
combined with Vega
yeah GPU you compute units all on the
same chip it is a single silicon chip
offering specifically for Zen cores up
to 10 Vega compute units and a unified
power delivering delivery system all in
a package that consumes under 15 watts
one yes'm 15 watt fantastic
I believe that's power consumption not
TDP they're here on that and the this
isn't an end tech article by the way all
the articles which is discussing today
are linked in the video's description
but in an antique they have the last
generation from 2015 at FX 9800 P and
these are the new to new ones the risin
5 2500 you in their eyes in 7 2700 you
very similar chips
not a huge amount of distinction between
the mainly it's just the basic lock box
you get it you get a slightly higher
base clock with 2700 you for the GPU -
yeah you get a little bit higher GPU
speed way to get more CEUs you get more
you get a better so you get a better GPU
you get a 10 compute unit Vega 10 unit
for just a compute unit Vega 8 units the
CPU side both are still quad cores both
still have SMT for simultaneous
multi-threading so you get 8 cores I'm
sorry 8 threads for your for course but
naming schemes tripping me out because
when I see 2700 you it reminds me of
like a 2700 k interesting you should
mention that Kyle yeah we're going back
to that name well good in just a brief
moment hold it but first okay I'm really
it's this this really hurts my
peripheral vision this is broken where I
really have to turn my head in order to
look at the screen over here is that
tilt back a little bit it's surprising
how like the Sith Lords from the actual
movies they never like turn their heads
frantically line up right Tommy what do
you say right yeah it was real life
that's what would be having the whole
time Lord Commander yes
well I'm over here son oh yes of course
[Laughter]
but anyway
Andy's pretty pretty stoked on these
chips though they're saying that there's
200% CPU performance at hydrants whoo
percent GPU performance gains over their
previous generation granted previous
generation is based on some fairly
outdated CPU architecture so you would
expect them to get some kind of boost it
up in there
but yeah uniting Zen and Zen and Vega
and all of the info here in this article
is about units that attend intend to be
used in laptops and other mobile devices
as far as I can tell
didn't see anything about a socketed
variety here hold on a sec I got a
reposition this universal socket then or
its bgg a socket in there yeah what I'd
be guessing there's not that again not a
lot in for there but I'm okay HP has an
Envy x-360 feature in their eyes in five
twenty five hundred you nice zoom there
lenovo has the IdeaPad seven 20s you can
get either cpu variant in here up to one
terabyte SSD now these are not like
super high end laptops or anything like
that these aren't going to be you know
your your ultrabook eighteen hundred two
thousand dollar competitors these are
reasonably priced but still fairly small
light weights and power efficient
laptops I bet with 15 watts of
consumption that's yeah that's gonna do
you some favors so yes max the frequency
thing in the power consumption though
the 15 watt is seems sort of like a more
of like a nominal number that they're
putting out there that they're what
they're saying is the frequency is
listed for these CPUs are more of an
efficiency sweet spot the frequencies
being about it to two gigahertz 2.2
gigahertz base clock with a three point
eight gig a gigahertz boost but OMS can
use these processors in configurable TDP
modes which AMD states are from 9 watts
to 25 watts so mainly by changing with
the power states it does not even much
of a change to the actual max frequency
it's just a change to the win it when it
turbos up in different different states
depending on how much compute processing
power is needed mm-hmm but nine watts of
25 so there's some flexibility they
the limitation here compared to if you
compare this to like a risin risin core
like this the eight core desktop that's
not Verizon see that rise ins based on
is only one Meg of cache 1 Meg of l3
cache per core rather than 2 Meg's so
you get 4 Meg's total of l3 cache with
these chips they use infinity fabric to
connect between the CPU and GPU segments
and the the GPU runs at half the clock
rate of the memory ddr4 2400 is what
it's rated for I'm not I'm not sure if
it's gonna if they're gonna offer faster
speeds than that at all but yeah as I
mentioned these laptops that I showed
you briefly or a little bit on the on
the more affordable price side middle
range 600 to $1,000 notebooks 13.3 inch
4k displays up to one terabyte SSDs 48
to 55 watt hour batteries and this last
page of the article is fairly
interesting because they're discussing
this in the as Zen 1.5 and of course
we've talked about Zen being kind of
like the performance of Rison was kind
of the entry level of what AMD was
expecting to get out of Zen the
architecture so what they're saying here
is they're they've the reason that
they've named these CPUs with 2000
numbers like the rise in CPUs are all
1000 numbers 1800 X 1700 and so forth
these are 2000 series CPUs because they
felt that there was enough advancements
to warrant that yes many of the design
ideas that AMD wanted to put into the
original desktop Rison but couldn't do
the time eventually ended up and rise in
mobile such as updated precision
precision boost for example so or maybe
they just ran out of numbers in the
there were a lot they only used the 1950
they only used like probably less than
20 numbers in the 1000
--that would leave right to my math
something like a hundred at least a
hundred more numbers between 1000 and
1999 that gets too confusing thank you
nice hole number sir we're excited about
these Mobile's mobile CPUs of course if
you're out in the market for a laptop
very good for you you know it seems like
a nice sweet spot it sounds a little
very low power draw quad-core with the
built-in graphics which should be fairly
capable from from our understanding of
course some of these are gonna be
available right now and some of these
are coming soon and there should be more
announced for January in January at CES
I'd like to see some benchmarks between
the Vega 10 mobile and like intel's
integrated graphics well I'm of course
very interested to hear some more
details on socketed like a m4 socketed
varieties of these ap use video yeah
finally get those video outs to use that
we've been I need to use I really like
the concept of like you know you get a
nice kind of super budget 70 $80 BD you
be 350 or the X 300 or whatever that are
the chipset that they teased from for
small factor a little mini ITX
motherboard and like one of those little
AP use and drop it in there and you can
have like a nice music multi-purpose
like gaming and HTTP see writing that
can do some server work and that kind of
thing yeah you know there's lots of lots
of things you can do there and the power
draw again I mean especially for
something that you might keep always on
or something like that true surprise all
right
intel has finally released a product
that's a little bit more hopefully will
be a little bit more about well received
when it comes to their 3d cross the 3d
crosspoint technology this is the
obtained 900p and this is just dropped
late last week it's available in a
couple different capacities 280 gig at
480 gig
and it looks kind of cool PCI Express as
you can probably tell looks very similar
to the enterprise a high-level version
of this that they launched but that one
was insanely expensive this one also
pretty expensive it's about twice the
dollar per gig that you would pay for
this purchase something like a high-end
nvme SSD like a 960 pro from Samsung for
example but it is a more feasible or I'd
say more reasonable implement
implementation of octane of 3d
crosspoints as far as the memory goes
because the memory is what's important
here the actual storage itself this
isn't an another nan tech article but as
you can see here it's got the Intel 128
gigabit 3d crosspoint controller
interface pcie 3.0 and sequential reads
and writes 2500 megabytes per second in
2000 megabytes per second sequential
reads and writes it's very fast but it's
not necessarily insanely faster than
something like a 960 pro not where it's
a it's it's its forte is really good
random read I ops random read and random
write I ops and power consumption is
quite good as well so the question that
the article asks and that you might ask
yourself if you're a storage junkie is
like who's this actually made for it's
not made for a standard at-home desktop
computer it's made for an application
that is a lot I'd like to actually get
any use out of this like alright good
you could buy this and put it in a
gaming PC no problem and maybe they're
expecting some people to do that because
there's a tie-in with with star citizen
which is kind of random plot but yeah
yeah I started the star citizen tie-in
which I thought there was something on
that yeah there's no pictures there's
definitely better buys in this unless
you're doing something like video
editing maybe yes this is random random
reads and writes where that's really
important video editing but even with
video editing there's probably more
practical solutions like getting
multiple SATA drives and putting them
away in a raid configuration yeah or a
couple of EMU drives or something like
that that are more ease
we priced what this drive is good at is
crazy fast random reads which is very
good for database lookups and so again
you're looking at more like Server
Enterprise type applications some really
high color depths high-resolution video
editing so if you have really like just
a crazy bit rates then yes pulling that
off of the drive like this would be much
faster than the alternatives and more
traditional land based solutions but
probably one of the things this is
really going to be as far as a ram
upgrade and sort of a again like a cache
for your ram that's not quite as fast as
the ram but your ram goes from being you
know something in the tens you know 16
gigs or 32 gigs or even 128 gigs to
several hundred gigs which is a pretty
nice bump up and there are specific
software and applications that's really
like having that type of thing intel
specifically tested side effects houdini
rendering a high resolution animation
that included a 1.1 billion particle
water simulation and it was 2.7 times
faster than a samsung 960 pro so again a
very specific test setup by Intel but
just sort of an example of how does the
memory technology itself can be faster
but in a narrow range of applications
right that's very niche it will become
wider and more useful and you know this
is the type of thing that we hope
trickles down to more people but yeah
it's not for games but the star citizen
bundle you get an exclusive ship in star
citizen you can only get in by buying
this SSD that's so random because it's
not even a product that's necessarily
catered to gamers at all like this these
are more more professional based it's
like it's more of a promotion thing yeah
but then I'd enter like practical like
hey use this drive to play nish niche
right niche niche but yeah alright the
article from an anti concludes this is
an amazing tech piece of technology but
one whose benefits are difficult to
fully enjoy low queue depth random read
performance of the opt in SSD is several
times faster than any flash-based SSDs
loke you death so you'll find with a lot
of SATA and nvme SSDs in order to test
them and see what the drive can do
you'll see queue depth a queue depth 32
mm hmm but practically speaking again no
at home desktop usage even in a server
environment yeah you rarely get past
queue depth 4 or 8 yeah maybe 16 ish so
depending what you're doing of course
there's lots of variables what this
drive can do is it can hit the numbers
that normal SSDs can hit at really low
qtips
give my queue depth 1 or 2 or something
as long as you're pumping enough data
into it yeah are giving it enough work
to do it will give you the speeds that
other drives need to be a queue data 232
in order to hit I guess that's part of
it I just looked up the specs really
quick on the 960 Pro for random reads
and writes queued up to 32 and it's like
442 366 to the 440s yeah so you can see
a big jump that's a big jump but yeah if
you're you if you're doing that specific
workload yeah
also unique when it comes to SSDs and
sort of can sort of typical conventional
things that you might expect if you look
in SSDs this drive performs just as well
when it's full as when it's empty a lot
of SSDs slow down when they get almost
full it also performs very consistently
over time with far fewer high latency
outliers also both drive capacities the
280 gig in the foreign 80 gig perform
the same so you don't need to buy the
higher capacity drive in order to get
better performance which is often the
case with NAND base SSDs because you
have a controller with a certain number
of channels and you they're only gonna
saturate all those channels if you give
it enough name chips to connect to so
right you know the hundred twenty-eight
gig model doesn't perform as good as a
256 bit model that kind of thing
anyway them as a little bit more info on
the 900 P from Intel interesting one
last piece of hardware here the surface
pro oh I forgot to make up on the
Microsoft circuit your photo is a
popular piece of hardware as
a mobile device and Intel I'm sorry
Microsoft is coming out with a new one
specifically this one has a 450 megabit
per second LTE version of it it's
launching December 1st there's two
versions of it this was announced today
actually at an event in London surface
pro with LTE advanced two configurations
one and both of them have a Core i5 and
I believe that is a coffee like Core i5
one of them has 4 gigs of RAM and 128
gigs of storage the other has a gigs of
ram and 256 gigs of storage so double
your RAM double your storage capacity
with the more expensive version 1150 is
the cheaper one 1450 is US dollars
$1,450 for the more expensive one can
you game on you could probably do some
gaming on it but it does not have
anything like a discrete GPU so I
wouldn't I wouldn't bet on that too much
worthless hood is getting hot Oh fine
fine 606 so it sort of feels like the AC
still on I can't tell ya supposedly you
paid extra for to have the AC AC today
errr Newman yeah but they didn't do that
then sue you sue them I will I'm suing
the person I'll punch them in the face
and I'll write them an email right now
says I will sue you in five minutes
ac doesn't turn on alright
the modem though that they're including
with the LTE version is pretty pretty
crazy it's a category 9 LTE advanced
modem up to 450 megabits per second
download speed of course on a suitable
network phone network that you're
connected to that has the capability of
providing you that much data that's the
maximum theoretical bandwidth the modem
supports 20 different radio bands so it
should support LTE connectivity you know
why in most countries basically as long
as you have a sim for that country of
course and that's gonna be very useful
for people with this device because it's
very popular for business persons on the
go that kind of thing you won't have to
tether yes Microsoft also insists that
the LTE battery life will be
substantially identical
so when using Wi-Fi I don't know what
substantially identical means I guess
mostly it's like it's it's nicely
perfect with exceptions it's it's
completely almost I don't know yeah
but yeah they used a word like
substantial to cover up a word like
barely yeah this goes on sale December
first launching in 22 markets US Canada
Australia New Zealand US Austria Belgium
Denmark Finland France Germany Ireland
Italy Japan Luxembourg Netherlands
Norway Poland Portugal Spain Sweden
Switzerland and the UK so if I'm reading
that correctly
it's like Europe and english-speaking
countries
and Japan in Japan the outlier Hey
yes all right well we got the tech news
tick all right so the iPhone X oh wait I
should I should click over the story I'm
talking about have you seen any of the
iPhone X reviews no why what I wanted to
there was probably from a YouTube video
because probably the scuttlebutt with
the iPhone X launched is that there was
a bunch of youtubers given the iPhone X
by Apple okay whereas a lot of your
traditional media traditional and you
know as in the past 10-15 years as far
as traditional internet media written
sites such as courts where I'm reading
this article from were not given the
iPhone X oh so a lot of really got
privileged traditional media sites got
kind of scooped by the youtubers a
little bit but there's also complaints
about the YouTube videos being perhaps a
little bit fluffy flood I can't think
like fashion magazines video listicle of
what it thinks are the top ten features
of the new iPhone
Oh No how do they do top ten features in
a minute in 23 seconds it's the top 10
Kyle
number one it's a phone number two it's
an iPhone no.3 and face ID which is
probably gonna be the one of the most
controversial Wow face ID made it on
there one of the top 10 Wow cuz like who
needs to convenience of it reading your
fingerprint when you can have it
awkwardly look at your face this is
cringe this is pure crazy this is the
scariest thing on Halloween this year
all right now soldiers way back when
soldier knows best also did did a video
on this got a decent amount of views
there so far soldier knows best did a
video on it there's quite a few
youtubers here did it a lot of them I
believe actually went to New York for
the hands-on experience with it to get
their video and whatnot but you know
some of the traditional media was a
little bit up in arms over this because
you know how dare these youtubers go and
to view this damn I sent some saltiness
in the force as recently as last month
iPhone 8 review units went out to a
bunch of news outlets like the verge and
TechCrunch in Forbes this time it seems
the company has only given an iPhone X
to Steven Levy at Wired who happens to
have also reviewed the first iPhone ever
a decade ago plus a smattering of
youtubers and outlets publishing
directly to YouTube there's still gonna
be lots of standard reviews of course
once more people get their hands on them
and again I'm expecting face ID has been
one of the most critiqued things as far
as like no useful usable it is and how
secure it is and all that kind of stuff
also you know an emojis thing now what
emojis an emotive and emojis I don't
know that animal like emojis of just a
person named Connor popular science
apparently but but this is this is
typical people like if someone gets
something cool there's always gonna be
the man out there's always gonna be
somebody that's not happy or somebody
who feels like they've been tossed aside
and you know when all the established
you know old timey written reviewers and
journalists were getting samples all the
youtubers were complaining
YouTube's a legitimate medium for you
know the actual reviewers who are doing
video content on that platform and then
you know and then so the focus is
clearly shift at least at least for this
launch
now all the old reviewers are pissed off
because all the youtubers have phones
like it's this is just this is so
typical it disconnected so for some
reason oh sorry about that I do have a
straw poll actually I wanted to post
four people
please voted my straw poll we're gonna
see what y'all think of this an emojis
oh so it's like animated emojis are yeah
yeah animated emojis just sort of poop
the poop emoji can the poo can be all
squishy whatever you can you can stink
and we so yeah what do you think about
was decision to mostly latch mostly
sample youtubers for the initial iPhone
X launch refused whoa Mouse isn't
batteries that's fine um the end let us
let us know what you think of that one I
can't post it I don't know if cells with
us today but so if you can post that in
YouTube chat that be hi oh he already
did tell your awesome knows we love you
cell
alright so yeah let us know what you
think there I'm gonna jump to the next
story we'll come back to that do it just
a moment's razor speaking of phones how
about a phone that can cut yeah ooh like
a race bull I don't know if that sounds
like a liability issue look at that job
to get away its 13:37 you see you ask
money Lee delete yeah it's a razor phone
has leaked you know leaks they're often
intentional or whatever razor acquired
next bit a while back and they've been
developing a smartphone for a while
mobile carrier 3G UK has leaked a
product page was a little bit more
information about this phone juice it's
got some pretty interesting specs
including a 120 Hertz 5.7 two-inch IGZO
display
the same sort of display that we're
using right now gaming phone on blade
yeah like a gaming phone display exuse
that's it's interesting no I think yours
is mine is not oh because you have the
beautiful magenta be 38 whatever yours
is a high-resolution one with the
touchscreen oh yes this is the lower
resolution but the higher refresh rate
gotcha um zoom back to specs eight gigs
of RAM 64 gigs of storage a four
thousand milliamp hour battery with
Qualcomm quick charge 4.0 THX certified
dual front-facing speakers with Dolby
Atmos dual camera setup on the back a 12
megapixel F 1.75 wide angle sensor and a
13 megapixel F 2.6 zoom sensor so one
whether you know the first one would be
like your what the bokeh okay so far I
haven't heard you mention RGB once and
this is a razer product we're talking
well it's good lightly consuming i'm
sure can do all that cut all the
different colors i don't know if the
logo on the back the logo something like
the size the screen likes to illuminate
in 16.8 million colors or i will be
severely disappointed sure the screen
can do that much well the screen any
phone screen can technically do that
just some yes no not good enough long as
it doesn't get burnin this is a razer
product paul i still haven't opened my
eye picks 'l - oh are you scared
probably tomorrow are you scared - no i
just say like it when I open it I want
to I want to do yeah I just I just
haven't haven't got to yet alright I'll
get to it eventually
alright it's also got something called
4G super voice which appears to be some
sort of technology that prevents dead
zones wow that sounds like it sounds
like magic sounds like prevents
Dead's a differently reference by the
article says is a 1440p display and a
snapdragon 835 CPU powering also appears
to be running a pretty stock version of
Android which is often appreciated and
as Kyle already mentioned lol it says 1
3 3 7 and
and the picture I called it uh leave all
be reference those your back to oh the
camera went off Kyle this is a battery
what
no I happen to the camera it looks like
we're back its back everybody move don't
move heck don't touch it happening I
don't know
Halloween's better happy they must be
haunted they don't have a technology the
Nights Watch yeah no idea what I'm doing
right now yeah well let us know if that
happens that was definitely a ghost yeah
you're right
moving oh wait no I was gonna show you
guys let's see so you thought most
people then notice and the rest of them
aren't even gonna vote in this temple
the babes probably the best idea you
want I don't want to give the man any
information information beyond that
though most people the most people who
actually had an opinion said that they
liked it's an old media is dead and
YouTube is better make sense since
they're all taking this away from
YouTube yeah only 5% to we're going to
sucks thank you all for your vote send
your feedback let's move on to PCIe 4.0
hmm yes indeed and indeedy and so I
didn't do bleep getting too into the
Sith character here pci-sig which is PCI
special interest group which is about
800 companies includes Intel Nvidia AMD
have released the PCIe 4.0 specification
version 1 so it's 4.0 version 1.0 thank
you but you add that up and Peter you
get 5.0 yeah which is also in the works
PCIe 5.0 whoa here's some motherboards
that feature none of these the things
that are being talked about in the
article it's lame but hey pictures of
motherboards it's like a hard line box
to do the biggest change as has happened
in previous generations of PCIe going
from 1 to 2 to 3 that we're on right now
is doubling the transfer rates going
from 8
transfers per second and eight gigabits
per second of link bandwidth per Lane to
16 Giga transfers per second and 16 Giga
bits of bandwidth link that is double
that's twice as much I can confirm that
means you get a total throughput of 64
gigabytes per second per 16 Lane slots
which is what you'd expect plug like I
and graphics card into pci-sig was on a
four-year release cycle as you can see
by this handy chart for a while like
every three to four years they went from
PCIe one to two to three however it has
been seven years now since pcie 3.0 was
released all the way back in 2010 the
current standard provided enough
bandwidth this is what PCA a pci-sig
says that the 3.0 was providing enough
bandwidth before the rise of
technologies such as PCIe nvme storage
and 10 Gigabit Ethernet network cards
which actually can saturate that bus and
got piled on with those devices and some
graphics cards and whatnot especially if
you're limited to only 28 lanes of PCI
Express gen3 on your 8 core CPU like 78
20x users are settled with well like me
and my an arctic panther is 20 right now
it's a 72 28 yeah I haven't I haven't
figured out me yeah for now it's totally
fine but other advantages of PCI a 4.0
include Lane margining IO virtualization
and platform of integration and extended
tags for service devices it's always
convenient but also PCIe 5.0 is also
discussed in this article because that
seems to be more closely on the horizon
especially if you consider the gap
between 3.0 and 4.0 pci-sig Eames to
release an early version of 5.0 which
will again double performance to 32 gig
attracts Furze per second in the second
quarter of 2019
which is only it's less than two years
away so when they say that they're going
to release a new version of PCI Express
they're there meaning that they're gonna
release it to like Nvidia AMD it's a
standard they developed a standard over
time what's happened right now is the
final they finalized version of PCIe 4.0
one point version 1.0 that's a little
bit that's right now right 5.0 they're
not talking about getting to the point
where they're at with 4.0 right now with
5.0 in 2019 they're talking about having
outlines of the standards okay
an early version of the next generation
specs but still seems like pretty an
accelerated timeline so speculation that
I've seen is like some depending on what
we see for the motherboard launches over
the next couple years and different
platforms and whatnot there's some that
might skip 4.0 entirely and suddenly
jump to fight for you I don't know okay
I don't know maybe we'll see what
happens
yeah all right couple more quick
discussion things and pocalypse have you
been affected maybe like a little bit I
think one of my videos got demonetised
Divya have you had any videos get the
not suitable for all advertisers thing
yeah I think I got like one or two of
those and I was like why would they do
it to that video there are like all
these other videos that should be
demonetized and and blocked but they
picked like the most harmless one so I
was like okay it's usually silly reasons
their algorithms screwed they wouldn't
even give me a reason I like terms like
here here find out why it was just like
a blank page so I I don't know what
about you
I haven't really had to deal with it
thankfully I'm surprised about awesome
hardware my other videos a pretty tame
right most part yeah if anything's gonna
get blocked it's this show it would be
this show I can't be like that's that's
reasonable if it if awesome hardware had
limited ads I think it's perfectly a
good idea I agree with you on this one
but for now we'll keep it why the
everything's fine so but what has been a
big problem for a lot of creators for
several months now including some
friends of ours not just in the like
wider realm of YouTube but also in the
tech spaces is affecting people as well
but YouTube according to youtube so
grain of salt and we'll see what happens
is promising to make things a little bit
better in this article details a little
bit of things that they're expecting
which is mainly that they expect their
creators to lose less ad money which is
useful if you're trying to be creator
and make a you know make a living off of
it suddenly having your videos D
monetized or limited advertising on them
is pretty challenging
they said this this should reduce the
number of misclassified d monetize
videos they expect 30% fewer videos that
have to make do with limited ads on
their way to becoming fully monetized
because usually when this happens to say
a mid-sized Channel mm-hmm it'll happen
you submit for manual review and then
depending on the I believe I don't know
if it's the number of views on the
videos and the number of subscribers on
the channel it will get manly manually
reviewed and you know if it's if it's if
there's nothing in the video that's D
monetization worthy then theoretically
you know suddenly you get full ad
support on it but right during that time
of course which is a very key time when
videos are posted yeah you have limited
ads and so you don't make as much money
that's lame so there's no like money pot
like there is when something gets
contested no cuz it's just it's not
showing the ads and they're shown then
it's not like it's showing the ads and
saving the money baby
yes has it shown so ad that shown money
didn't money no paid claim YouTube used
appeals over the summer which of which
there were many to refine the machine
learning system that automatically
categorizes these videos and in theory
the system should continue to improve
both as more appeals come in and YouTube
itself gets better determining what
constitutes an offensive video problem
is that this isn't much consolation to
creators who depend on YouTube for
income and lost a significant chunk of
money and what I was going to point out
I thought I had it linked
have any of our fellow tech tubers been
affected heavily as gonna cuz I have
been to some small degree but it's like
it's a very very slight maybe like one
or two one or two videos in the last
friend Steve over it Hardware unboxed
has been dealing with no pretty hardcore
they have the most harmless and
informative videos so ever so yeah this
is such a where to go
broken record yeah I did see video this
week has been demonetised and be
monetized a few days later this is what
it looks like in your UI when you look
at it you can see thirty thousand views
not suitable for most advertisers so all
these views on this video have been
shown limited ads which might mean
that's that doesn't mean there's no ads
but the ads that are getting the most
money right and the most lucrative and
the other normal that you would expect
to be normal most the time aren't aren't
showing songs had to do the request
review process and then they come back
later and do it maybe YouTube's like a
closet Intel fanboy yeah you can see
back here yesterday's video just got
pings here's another one
Wow and it's like a 1070 TI core i5 8400
gaming bills
I mean granite he opens the video with a
string of epithets and talks about how
Australians should rule the world kill
everyone else but you know that's just
steep that's just Steve being Steve it's
YouTube just like being run right now by
just some like stupid dude that's like
what are these words I don't understand
how they to make themselves a more
legitimate platform sense presents its
going to big advertisers who typically
advertise on mainstream more mainstream
media platforms such as TV but in order
to do that they need to have some
semblance of being able to say alright
your ads not gonna get shown in front of
a video of a dude who's like you know
squirting diarrhea out of his butt for
three minutes straight or something like
I don't know I don't know it's not
appropriate but you know it's disgusting
without appropriate that's the view
you're planning of it end up that it's
perfect
anyway final story of the news Sony is
working on a robot dub a robot dog
yeah okay that's just awesome there's
three of them they're wearing outfits
for human strange reason they had a
media there is a media event planned in
November for this Doug shaped pet robot
they want to launch next spring it's
unclear whether this will use the AIBO
name because I bow is an existing AI
robot that so many are t-cells in fact
they sold 150,000 eye bows between 1999
and 2006 now they got this dog it is a
robot capable of forming an emotional
bond with customers and able to grow to
inspire love and affection that is just
creepy sign of bad things supposed to be
like an anti-type thing as well so you
can like talk to it and interact with it
I felt like the article was kind of
actually kind of shirt on explaining
what exactly the dog can do for you I
mean granted a cute little robot dog
there's some you know I want a cute
little robot dog but like can I tell it
like hey robot dog go trade stocks for
me or something and it doesn't like a
master I made you $80,000 but no
something like that but then five second
AI should be able to do that that's
that's weird and why is the dog wearing
clothes I don't know
not even regular doggies need clothes
it's soni and they got this little kid
they're like let's make the dog more
approachable by giving it a velvet thing
like a Beetlejuice costume just weird
this is the I bow by the way this is not
the nude this is that's a new robot dog
this is the I bow okay that's pictures
there's a new and improved version of
this so there you go that's Sony robot
dog all right uh that's all I have for
my plans remarks and everything what do
you have there segue into that I see
here they're supposed to carve a pumpkin
do you still wanna do that uh yeah you
have a pumpkin you hold it up okay I'll
slice I I don't have a pumpkin on me I
brought a pumpkin oh you brought one
never Oh
you listen it which is the one where
you're supposed to carve last week we
did that time for right I am so hot yeah
me too we go casual casual cosplay and
every time I look down my my Jon Snow
hair gets in my face
and it's very distracting better that's
way better ha ha is a magical magical
fruit alright so uh me by the Lord of
Light my thought was to carve a pumpkin
you know just straight right just out in
the open
this is the idea impromptu carving um so
you want to do that we could there's
also in that bag with some paper to put
some paper down okay
yeah it's covered and pumpkin all right
let's freakin do it so guys let us know
what wish we go its shape we should
carve into the pumpkin what if we carved
Sith Lord Babel who's the greatest big
penis
stick the penis this is for taking away
our dildo swinging privileges so we've
got got some paper here valuable
resources all right
yes do you have a knife I do oh cool
cool so this one has a sheet do you do
the same thing I do and like take all
the seats out first oh yeah okay this
seems your same thing you do that like
that's the same thing everyone does it's
a secret all right
trick it's pumpkin carving this together
you got to get a nice wide area top so
you can scoop out the stuff inside is it
probably not the best pumpkin carving
doing great doing great so far thank you
Oh
don't cut towards yourself I'm not
cutting towards myself making me nervous
coming towards you're not a real stiff
you know what you won't recover very
nice
well the illusion you're watching is
fully convinced yeah let's uh we carve I
mean kind of are you thinking like a
face or like words or like a picture I
don't know do we have any suggestions
you shot guys what should we carve on
the actual pumpkin and my life chat went
away so I can't see I can't see a
YouTube chat anymore good car
you do the windows logo what oh yes this
might be a larger knife a little quicker
yeah we were planning to okay Oh awesome
cool hey okay cool
spoons - you came prepared tried too bad
bad oh good it doesn't look like it's a
super wet pumpkin yeah
that's just good looks slightly dry
which is better I mean I was playing a
scary that's cooking last week you're at
a time so sure oh are you gonna roast
them yes no no you can
there's the toasted pumpkin seeds
they're freaking awesome they are they
are the best we've eaten a lot of
shallots here Cal's gonna scoop out some
of that meanwhile yes I'm gonna get
started on our comments or our questions
since we have had some questions asked
of us starting off with Scott Dilbeck
Scotty six dollars and 66 cents
consistent has always got peppy
Halloween what was your favorite costume
you ever wore what do you think a
favorite costume ever my favorite
costume ever like a really good costume
I don't think I've ever gone all out to
be honest I feel like this wasn't one
that you spent like months weeks
beforehand
yeah and that's like then nothing like
that you know I dressed up when I was a
kid obviously just little random kid
costumes and when I got old enough to
actually put time and effort into my
costume I didn't give a anymore so
I just never dressed up as anything I'm
pretty happy with my Jon Snow costume to
be honest yeah it's not well it's one of
the cooler ones I've done in recent
years I like tell my my my sis costume
turned out this year although granted I
didn't none of the stuff
handmade or anything like that Oh
neither is mine so yeah all right this
is really toast at least your hair is
your own hair my hair is my own hair

like third second or third grade and I
am pretty good like the black mask put
the mask and I had a sword and
everything so I was like Wesley as Dread
Pirate Roberts and Princess Bride yes

day it was pure hell and eating it
wasn't even the worst part was to be
honest it was the day after day after it
was when multiple trips to the bathroom
were taken it really killed yeah it was
bad but we might have gotten a
sponsorship deal out of it okay cuz the
guys from over at seven jerky hit me up
they damaged me on Twitter like hey we
love what we did to your mouth and
asshole I work with you closer they
didn't say that exactly basically
between the lines were saying that so
maybe we'll see seeing more of them
later alright Sam and and Thank You
Thomas for sending that over Sam n 5
bucks did you ever hear the tragedy of
dark Plagueis the wise nomad a story
story that good I would tell you it's
Sunday I was wondering when prequel
prequel memes would arrive but yes we
were expecting you expecting you welcome
but for now I have the high ground
Fred rants $50 Thank You Fred oh my god
bread for your loving wife so much that
you would take her to dinner
without being encouraged by someone on
YouTube unlike someone else we know
everyone say bad Kyle bad Kyle yes have
you not taken your wife to dinner

I guess I will use that to take my wife
out to dinner hear something thank you
forget that Dennis rigged in five bucks
for spending Halloween with us five
dollars for you and Kyle's next thank
you
much obliged and yeah it's convenient
that we are in at Kyle's office for this
one because we don't have
trick-or-treaters coming to the door
that's true if we were in my house we
don't get a lot of trick-or-treaters at
my house but um don't when they did
arrive the dogs would really cause some
problems so I hope she's having her
didn't Orion zero dress up at all
no okay where we've been considering
some costumes for that but I'd have been
adorable that's some good ideas but
didn't go through that
Noorie hate would hate it oh yeah here
we might be able to get to wear
something all right
maybe next ZZR Hardy with 20 Australian
I believe your mascara has run oh
nothing
scared of your face it's trying to get
away the the dark side you know when you
commit to the dark side you start to get
the creep of the did it affects the way
you looking stuff like that
yep learn that from The Old Republic
Fred Rance thank you is easy hardy yeah
Fred rant with $10 $100 to the first of
you who tests
liquid metal on a GPU in place of
thermal tape or paste oh I wonder if the
temps will drop like a CPU it's a good
question as I haven't known the most of
the big stock Tim to be that bad on GPUs
yeah compared to C no she was pretty
adequate I mean it's not the fact that
liquid metal is awesome it's just the
fact that like Intel uses really crap
Tim on there
if you used to begin with poor quality
and not the best contacts
yeah always I guess but yes I guess Kyle
that's a hundred bucks I forget all
right you're closer than I am right now
because you haven't deleted something
that's true we'll talk more about that
accounts have the show yeah
checker tile lol five dollars love you
guys I miss watching this ding at school
and Eastern Time
we're on Western time and move east
coast this is a good time for us to have
the show so when we have it okay thank
you check it out the right connect with
$10 happy Halloween my birthday is
tomorrow can you give me an awesome
birthday present
by doing the advanced rise in
overclocking video ha T advanced oh I'm
sorry they're right eunuch
yeah because I did it and I did a basic
rise in overclocking video which a ha I
think it was a very good video as one of
the ones I was like yeah that turned out
well yeah and in that video I was like
I'm gonna do an advanced version of a
 game never promised them and I
never did know so anything they will
remember and suddenly and I was like
maybe people just didn't realize that
the right connect is keeping me honest I
can still do that I can still do that so
I am going to give you at least a 50-50
chance that I will follow through make
sure you look that one guy's then he
says ha I know you're busy but seriously
please see it I will say I can do that I
did have some really good ideas for that
that didn't fall through it so I think
it would be a good thing seeds are good
we've got the same blue one here will be
tasty I'm not sure what we've seen as
far as suggestions east coast for life
oh yeah west side till we die water cool
fool hey cow but is there any more beer
there is would you like the 22 ounce
bottles that we got oh yeah let's do
that
they're pretty baller yeah pretty sweet
markku fool with the $10 donation
conduce four aces X 399 owners ek
finally came out with a monoblock asus
rog zenith extreme asus prime xc-99 - a
Arthur's yeah
the base is prime extra nineteen attache
the RG Strix XD 19
II and the RJ's units extreme are all
supported bar cool thank you your name
you're living up to your name and ek
does some nice monoblocks my ex 299
monoblock is doing a good job so far you
know I might have to get one as well
yeah that would be appropriate for what
you got going on in there yep more in
the second half Stacy that's great when
you say like I'm making the ultimate
awesome elite whatever it's like
suddenly you have all is it like why
didn't you take that to the next slide
oh right yep
well see I didn't think I needed to
until gamers Nexus they should cut well
did you had you watched any of their
liquid metal stuff beforehand for this
generation beforehand briefly I didn't
watch all of it I mean there's a lot of
stuff but it's pretty evident based on
their testing that yeah it's a like I
liked STV presented it because he was
like Intel you're you're losing your
throwing performance out the window yeah
by using this type of time on there and
stuff but right so you got my message
about long-term use though right yes
yeah you're gonna are you gonna intend
it to be a short-term build for now yeah
I'm gonna try to apply it within a year
or so or oh actually well I've heard
with liquid metal you might need to take
a look even closer than even sooner than
well I think that would be cool to
actually test the thermals as time goes
on maybe every week or every month I do
the same exact test this don't let him
to see if don't let it go to zero up if
you're consistent with that and you have
a long-term results that would be very
interesting to see yeah so yeah looking
forward to it's a good idea all right
all right
hahaha Polytech computer mind $5
donation hey guys love the videos any
advice for a new builder modder trying
to break into the community drink a beer
for me cheers I'm breaking into the
community isn't too tough it's a very
accepting community very friendly in my
experience yeah most of the time people
who are negative in the community I see
shouted down by other people like anyone
who's like overly critical of a newbie
doesn't know their way around or that
kind of thing yeah like as long as you
come at it with the right attitude I
feel like it's a it's a very good
community to get into the pc building
community um beyond that if you're
talking about like doing social media
and like maybe YouTube channel and you
know growing a subscriber base like that
it's just got to be something that
you're passionate about and that you're
willing to do for an extended period of
time without looking for too much
feedback at first because there's lots
of people trying to do it so right just
I would say if that's what you're going
for focus on looking at the what you're
able to produce and the feedback you get
from the people who do look at it and
don't worry about the numbers just worry
about that core group of people who
actually start watching your stuff if
you can cultivate that and keep making
stuff that you like and that the people
who are watching like then you will get
a fan base that continues to grow over
time good advice in my experience a
that's social I would have to agree with
that
alright michael Morton five bucks hey
guys been watching guest for a year now
awesome thank you Michael both of you
have helped me build my first PC and
today upgrade with water cooling ooh
sweet nice water cooling is very
efficient very good way of cooling very
expensive and and somewhat expensive
thank you Michael Knight vine Adelle
live via with a 5-pound GBP donation
have you ever used alpha cool water
block seven getting a free one sent up
for my GPU any issues I should know
about
I don't know haven't heard about issues
with alpha cool water blocks yeah I I
think alpha cool stuff is pretty pretty
good it's probably safe I can't say I've
used as much of their stuff extensively
although I should reach out to them
because I did I haven't met them at
Computex a couple times and talked about
doing stuff and I had never followed up
with them so that's my bed but they do
good stuff J gave me a bunch a set of
alpha cool fittings and they were like
like visually they were they were a
little like loose and wobbly and stuff
like that but he was like these fittings
never leak they've never leaked and
everything they've said me has never had
a leak before
that's good news like they don't look
that great I mean then granted these are
older stuff they have nicer they have
nicest stuff too but like they're they
just really solid fittings for for
everyday use and thrown together loop
real quick and that kind of stuff so
yeah night Josh I believe your name is
Josh Josh you should be you should be
good you guys heard it here folks you
heard it straight from Jay Alpha cool
products never go bad that's a JCAR
forever perfect all right
five dollars Australian oh wait no I'm
sorry Argentina last question mr.
night-night
this one's from Josh Saunders five
million you guys are great also Steve is
great with benchmarks if if you can give
a spoiler when you on flute paint flute
playing Kyle that is that will be
revealed soon yeah yes I am curly and
talks with the people over at LTT or LMG
as they call it so yes yo you all know
very soon enough what the future holds
for that you should because I'm scared I
don't I don't want to be the only one on
it is will you be the only one besides I
I yes I'll be the first one I think
who'll officially partnered with them I
think the sound of guinea pig can
provide the contrast of the experience
between doing your premium bit little
Channel versus patreon versus yeah kind
of in a unique position to profess true
I mean I think that's why - kind of
snatched me up when he did because he
caught wind that YouTube was ending or
killing all the paid channels on their
platform and so he knew that I was gonna
have to switch to somewhere and as Linus
usually does he seizes an opportunity
and he called me up it's like well your
please is it he dropped to his knees no
please I'm so scared I need you in my
life I was like Linus bitch alright
alright I'll do this one time for you
and he just continued to beg for like
another 30 minutes it was really sad are
you begging yep yep beer we have so much
beer so we have two 22 ounce bottles
here one is these my own shoes
rista has a breakfast of brown ale
brewed with espresso oatmeal and milk
sugars good stuff
let me also have Wi-Fi sauce found this
really interesting beer it's the inner
geek ale 25-year anniversary it's a
brown ale it's multi slightly roasted
dark fruit and caramel notes 5% alcohol
but look at the top there Blizzard yeah
it's the Blizzard logo Blizzard was this
made of beers this is special lab or was
just like a specialty brew they made for
Blizzcon or something like that is a
liquid entually it's bottle logic
brewing okay which i've not heard of its
kind of say where it's located uh
doesn't say right there but not allowed
well I'd say where they look but Oh Oh
Anaheim there you go there you go
they're in freaking Anaheim breweries
which is where Blizzcon is yep that
makes sense cool Blizzard beer and clown
shoes beater well thank you um I
companies
I'm gonna use my bottle opener to open
you should and you should buy one on his
site
Paul's Harvard ugh I took it upon myself
to drink this one because it is slightly
higher alcohol content okay 8.5% and
since you are driving home tonight I
would be the designated drunkard later
on yes good idea all right
we have a few more questions that have
been asked we're gonna get to those I
think what we're gonna do with the
pumpkin right here yes
we couldn't carbon was gutted but we are
getting a little over on time right now
so I think what we'll do is we'll start
Kyle's half of the show carving it and
since Kyle is gonna be talking about
tech news and stuff like that we'll kind
of get the carving going on like
throughout the show there we go that
works it I like that so more of the
pumpkin carving on causa it also ensures
that you guys watch the entire episode
exactly haha transition where's Martin
uh all right here we go CCM 1092 thanks
CCM for the $5 donation still planning
on the shorter show plus after Sh party
type dealio we've burnished out that
wait is it that's an idea that was kind
of fluted briefly yeah and one of the
shows
I'd like to do more gaming in general I
think the after party after the show is
probably less likely to happen just
because Tuesday is usually a fairly long
day for us
yeah and doing that at the very end like
we can do it but it's just it's very
tiring so I would rather do it on a day
when I know I have it coming when I
don't have a lot of stuff going on
before it when I can be a little bit
more kind of ready to go for it
yeah so yeah maybe maybe we could do
like like maybe once a month or maybe
once every other month we swapped out an
awesome hardware for just a gaming
stream I don't we just get together I
can I come in your place where you come
here and we'll just just gain for a
couple hours that could be worked out I
like that idea
we do have we are planning a long
probably we're gonna do a 12-hour
charity livestream where we're gonna
game and everything just like we did
last year combined with some charity
stuff to raise some money for charity
charity and stuff yeah because charity
and charity yeah but yeah they'll be a
lot that's gonna be a beginning of
December so we did that last year and it
worked out beautifully
yeah raised a ton of money and had a lot
of fun so you guys can join us for that
at least have that coming soon
all right thank you see cm Whitman 22 $5
donation hey Paul love your content
are you still working on your
wall-mounted HTPC looking forward to see
it finished an awesome job and black
black panther RK panther women thank you
but yes I am still working on the HTPC
and I'm gonna be moving to the next step
with that very soon I have the big piece
of wood and I hit I basically switched
over to focusing on arctic panther and
getting that done first I have a big
piece of wood but I do poly hardware
2017 I'm getting even I'm getting the
the rest of that finished ASAP all right
Fred rants baby bun freaking dollar ball
another $50 so it can be a nice day oh
we're going to taps super fancy water
gum water cool fool with five more
dollars alpha cool is known for flux in
their rad other than that they make
great products not sure if it has
changed water cool fool is named water
cool fool and he knows a lot about water
cooling otherwise he wouldn't be able to
name yourself that size Justin
but actually yeah that's reasonable and
that is some very good reason to always
flush your radiators in fact most of
your water cooling parts is a good idea
to flush them as thoroughly as you can
prayer to installing them but yeah thank
you for that Marco fool
Jakob Sharabi with five dollars
Australian and hey eleven the show
planning to build a dell inspiron 1555
sixty seven not sure if I should wait
for a rise in laptop thanks hmm Oh - bye
he's gonna buy a Dell wrapped up and not
sure if he should wait for resin well
you know honestly Jacob if if you've got
something that's functional for you
right now it's worth hanging out for a
little bit because they have just now
started the rise in laptops this
supposed to be a lot more at the
beginning of next year and this is the
first time just like with the mainstream
desktop CPUs stuff in 2017 this is going
to be the really the first time in a
long time that AMD has had a really
viable alternative to the Intel based
stuff on a laptop side that's not just
powerful enough to get the work done
that you need but also has the the power
draw the efficiency there for a long
battery life and that kind of thing so I
would say hang out maybe maybe maybe you
know keep a close eye on what deals
you've got coming up for Christmas time
and you know if not 26 2018 you should
have a lot more options as well yeah
Kalinin oh five dollars Canadian hey
guys love the show I am currently in
high school off to university in a few
months will doesn't know what programs
I should take really like computers
programs like classes maybe if you means
your audience yeah I mean computer
science is definitely a good way to go
try out programming see if you like
mentals um you could try web design
graphic design video editing or there
should be a computer building class I
feel yeah there's also a lot of digital
arts classes that are you know maybe not
necessarily as associated with the
hardware but something you can do with
the hardware and a lot of people might
find appealing like I went to college
for film and I you
used computers that I built it's time to
edit projects like video projects that I
did and everything so it was a good
reason for me to keep making sure I had
a nice computer available granted my
university had a lab that I could have
gone to a news but I'd rather use my own
system yes so something that you can use
computers for would also might be
something that would be a viable option
for you there too so yeah I hope those
are reasonable suggestions for you we're
not good at college half of college is
figuring out what you don't like yeah
it's basically you start off with a
giant chunk of wood and you just like
clay and you just slowly Whittle it down
be like no I don't like that I don't
like that I like that until you finally
find the one thing that sort of speaks
to you you're like okay I'll follow this
more or more aggressively so yes they'll
be discouraged Jonathan s Thank You Kyle
Jonathan s $10 first off our TV pumpkin
zoom we shout out to you guys third Kyle
help me pick out the NZXT s340 it leads
lastly what's your favorite episode you
both made secretly I forgot some
hardware pisode oh man it's hard to
remember the actual I remember these
like moments most yeah things that
happened on the show were likely we
broke down laughing and that sort of
thing I don't know which actual episode
had happened in the right like I can't I
feel like we've had some really good in
the last couple man episode 58 yeah
classic you know after like a hundred
episodes it kind of gets fuzzy it sort
of blurs together I think it's more so
than moments like individual moments of
the shows that we remember most not like
episodes as a whole
cuz there's never I don't think ever
been one perfect episode if you combined
all the awesome hardware's into one ball
at some point we'll get like a someone
to just do a massive montage yeah
awesome yeah you know if you're big
enough fan o separate Larry Jonathan s
with another five dollar donation he
says he meant separately the favorite
episode you both made separately
favorite episode like of our channels
like it just a video that we've made on
our channels - regular video I'm really
proud of the greatest greatest PC
marketing pitch of all time with the
tempered-glass RGB the crystal RGB video
I thought that was pretty fun that's
fine
the impersonations video I thought hit
pretty good part of that one and how to
build how to build a PC I spent a lot of
time on that tutorial and a lot of
people seem to like it so for some
reason the one that stands out to me the
Arctic Panther the original series build
that I did two years ago mm-hmm where we
bent where we did the tube bending with
me and J yeah I don't know for some
reason just filming that video and
editing it like those back when I was
still editing so I edited it and
everything and it's just all get really
like how the whole thing came together I
don't know yeah that one kind of stands
out to me I know there's others that I'd
like to but anyway thank you Jonathan
