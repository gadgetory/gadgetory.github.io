this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A segments where
you guys ask questions and I answer them
all the questions I'm going to be
answering from today are posted last
month's video probing Paul number 13
we're now into probing tall number 14
and and they're all of my old probing
polls are going all the way back into
the past in history but real quick a
side note right here from the beginning
if you haven't noticed I got a much
horizon processors I am in the works on
an overclocking video on those I was
planning on posting that today but it's
been slightly delayed but it should be
up in the next day or two let's get
right into this with our first question
which is posted on last month's probing
fall from Kade Ramirez what should you
do with old PC parts what is the best
way to going about selling them I'm
assuming by the second part of your
question that you're intending to sell
old PC parts and there are a few things
that I try to do in order to make
selling old PC parts more easy first off
is to make sure you keep the retail box
and all the accessories that's a great
way to show a potential buyer that you
care about the product and you were
carrying enough about it to keep tabs on
all that stuff so when you can sell it
you say look here's not just this
motherboard but also the i/o shield and
any little bits and pieces that might
have come with it they might need for a
build even if you didn't need for it
second thing would be to make sure it
works to get good photos of the thing
actually working and functional is a
great way to ensure people that when
they're buying it used that they're
actually going to get a functional part
offering some sort of means of
retraction or return if the part does
happen to be bad when the person gets it
as a good way to provide a little bit
more assurance as well because used PC
parts that's usually the biggest concern
is buying something that doesn't work
and then I make sure that if you're
using existing platforms like eBay eBay
is a good way to do it but you do tend
to lose a decent chunk of money paying
the eBay Commission's and that kind of
thing and then if you're using like a
local service like Craigslist or
something like a let go just make sure
that you abide by the best practices for
those as well meet in the public place
make sure the person is on the legit
make sure you confirm everything
beforehand as far as price and that
thing that kind of thing and with all
that you should be able to get a good
value for your
parts and then also hand them on to
someone who might get some better use
out of them next is Alex the sniper 19
what is your opinion on the rise in
gaming performance my opinion is still
evolving over time but I'd say it's
pretty good right now
now granted right when rising 7 launched
people were looking for what you could
nitpick about it because that's what
reviewers do they find the shortcomings
of a product and they tend to focus on
those so a lot of people got a little
upset because there's like oh horizon 7
you shouldn't be gaming at 1080 anyway
and that kind of thing but I thought it
was valid as far as the criticisms go I
was a little concerned about where it
might go from there because in my
experience there hasn't been a lot of
benefit to be gained in CPU performance
with games as time goes on as you might
expect with something like a graphics
card but it's already been shown that's
some pretty significant performance
boosts can be obtained we've seen it
demonstrated with ashes of the
singularity already with that game
update specifically for Rison we've seen
it with some more specific power plans
have been integrated into Windows 10
that do a little bit better job there so
I think the rising gaming performance is
good
borderline towards great which is I
think where Intel would be if you're if
you're lining that up with at least with
their newest generation of stuff and I
think the potential is only for it to
get better so especially with the right
and 5 launch that happened earlier this
week I think there's a lot more options
for people out there who wants a higher
core count higher thread that drag count
processor they can still be perfectly
finding games hopefully we'll see some
of those outlying scenarios where Rison
is lagging behind in really CPU limited
situations with specific games catching
back up but I'd say overall it's great
it's a great competitor to Intel and I'm
having no problem recommending the rise
and processors especially their eyes and
lives that have just come out especially
if you're looking for a nice bang for
your buck next is Bruno Gabriel kal
Bruno Gabriel Cavalcanti you maybe
you're Italian in your opinion is it
better to take a 1063 gig or rx4 74
playing at higher very high settings I
kind of answered a question similar to
this last month but I thought I'd
address this one more time first off if
you're getting the 1063 gig I might
reconsider the 1063 I just is pretty
hamstrung by the limited amount of
memory that's there and you will
eventually outpace it especially if
you're considering upgrading to a
high-resolution monitor in the future or
if you're playing at high and very high
settings bumpy
settings up can really eat up the system
memory depending on the game of course I
would lean towards the 470 especially if
you can get an 8 gig for 70 or just hold
out for a a bit longer because there's
tons of rumors about the 500 series
coming out from AMD which should have an
rx 580 and 570 replacements for the 470
480 and it would be interesting to see
what your options are after that happens
although we don't know for sure win it's
actually going to happen hopefully soon
though next from epic Kingdom should I
sell my 1080 SC for around 450 to 500
dollars and put that money towards DT X
1080 T I purchase now my my advice would
have been and sorry that this was three
weeks ago but hopefully it's still
relevant if you're going to do something
like that if you're going to sell a high
end graphics card right when the next
highest end graphics card comes out you
should do it right away because the view
and opinion of the 1080 being the top
GPU is going to slowly start to
deteriorate as there's better cards and
faster more performing cards above it so
I'd say that do that do that more
quickly if you can when the better card
comes out and then this is really an
enthusiast thing like you're saying I
really have a very nice graphics card
that it can handle just about anything
you're also not telling me what your
resolution you're playing at or that
kind of thing is I understand I
understand wanting to have the best in
the fastest that's out there but yeah I
guess I'll be my advice do it quickly or
do it before the 1080 TI even comes out
obviously that's that can't help you out
right now if you hear rumors that the
next card is going to come out and you
have like the ability to like sell your
existing card and get by with something
else for a while maybe that's an option
too but it's kind of hard to stay at the
top of the fastest GPU game without
dropping a bit of money so thank you for
that question
Shawn Fitz one two three four hey Paul
is there a way to duplicate my 250 gig
SSD onto a partition on my two terabyte
hard drive as a backup
there's actually quite a few ways you
can do this and it's definitely a very
good thing to do and actually I for
quite some time would show people to do
it using this this is the backup and
restore Windows 7 functions so it's
available in Windows 7 to the elbow and
Windows 8 to the elbow in Windows 10
although in Windows 10 it's label-less
backup and restore Windows 7 here you
can
do a couple different things the one
that I like to do is create a system
image you can do this right after you
install your operating system get all
your drivers installed get whatever
basic programs you want onto there and
then the system image utility will let
you take an image of your existing
operating system drive your SSD and back
it up to an attached mechanical drive or
something like that
that'll make an instantaneous snapshot
of your I can't my this is this is
blocked my shortcut keys from working
here we go I'll make an instantaneous
snapshot of your operating system in the
state that it is and then you can use
the Windows 10 installer or Windows 7
installer boot off of it
load that snapshot and then overwrite
your SSD and then you kind of be back to
where you started now if you're looking
for something that's more Ida rated a
turret 'iv that sort of does backups as
you go so you can like be like I want to
roll back to like a backup from a week
ago that also exists in here you can set
up a backup drive you can tell how
frequently you want to backup and
everything I don't think I've set one up
on here yet but again it'll allow you to
choose your mechanical drive or whatever
to backup to you can also save to a
network drive and that will actually do
snapshots as you go along that you can
kind of roll back to so those are the
functions that are built into Windows
beyond that I would suggest if you want
to pay some money for something get a
Cronus because that's been the software
that I've had the best experience with
as far as just working not having to do
anything funky and then if you want to
get a little bit dirtier your hands a
little bit dirty or maybe consider like
Clonezilla which I believe is open
source and free but it's definitely a
little bit tougher on the learning curve
to sort of set up and use next question
here from Rick bud Zac he said wait is
that a Tamra 90 millimeter F 2.8 Mac or
Lin sitting there yes as it is right
here this is my macro lens so anytime I
need like it's super close-up on
something I use this one it's a very
nice little lens I think it wasn't too
expensive I think it was only like three
or four hundred bucks which isn't
terribly expensive when it comes to
nicer decent lenses it's very large like
when you when you actually focus it gets
it extends quite a bit but any any time
you've seen me do videos like processes
like the Rison processors that just
launched and I have those close-up shots
with the very shallow depth of field and
bokeh going on and stuff like that
that's what this lens and
a lot it's an EF mount lens and I use it
with the meta bones adapter for my gh4
and it's a great option if I need to get
super super close-up on something I'm
really glad that I got it Nick Roth asks
what do you do with your completed
monthly builds when you're done
benchmarking the neck when you ask this
I had not yet posted this video which is
what happens to men with PPC builds
which is sort of an answer to your
question although this one was honestly
also partially just like a light mini
documentary of our trip to Vegas where
we shot guns and did other things as
well so it was a little random but it
was fun and at the end of this video I
delivered all or at least like like like
4/7 of the parts from that to Jennifer
who has been helping me out on my
channel and is also a good old friend of
mine so um basically I try to find uses
for them I guess would be the the final
question to that often I'll take them
apart set the parts aside and use those
parts and future builds and that kind of
thing if I can find a good home for it
I'll definitely try to do that and then
sometimes I do end up selling parts here
and there but often I just don't have
time to do that so I end up with parts
piling up which is I know not a terrible
problem to have but I'm working on other
solutions for it so I guess that's sort
of an answer for you I try to find
friends who need them and hand them down
or whatever sometimes I do some sales
sometimes I just keep the stuff around
here and then sometimes of course the
parts that are sent over I need to
return back to the vendor just kind of
depends on the situation
how many marketing samples they have in
that kind of thing a couple more
questions here from cyber Tonto 72 I
have a PCI Express 2 motherboard PCIe
gen 2 looking to get a new graphics card
with PCI Express gen3 will that card
work a short answer here is yes PCIe
gen3 is backwards compatible the PC a
Gen 2 you're going to lose about half
the bandwidth with Gen 2 versus Gen 3 so
like a PC a Gen 2 by 16 interface says
gosh I'm going to forget these numbers
here's the actual chart on Wikipedia you
get with 3.0 you have a transfer rate of
8 Giga transfers per second so by 16
gives you something close to 16
gigabytes per second which is roughly
double the a
bytes per second that you get with PCI
Express Gen 2 now does that matter
no in by-and-large no yes gen 3 is a
little bit faster when it's actually
tested it's like a couple percentage
points maybe faster so you'll get a
little slightly better performance with
Gen 3 but you can still work with Gen 2
my opinion you probably be suffering
from more of a cpu bottleneck if you
have a motherboard that actually goes
back and is only Gen 2 compliant you
must be on maybe Sandy Bridge or
something like that but you'll still be
just fine for now so I would say go
ahead get your graphics card do that
upgrade and then you know just keep an
eye on your performance and then plan to
eventually upgrade the rest of your
system in the meantime because if you're
on Gen 2 your motherboard and processor
starting to get a bit out of feet
Daniels Anson has a question on the
topic of poop looking because that's one
of the last questions I answered in the
last video which way did you try the
paper roll inwards or outwards I would
do I don't want you mean but I think
outwards the the the rolls here the flap
should be hanging on this side and here
on this side and that is because I don't
have cats I will give it to anyone who
asked cats put it on the inside it keeps
them from doing the claw thing as I've
never experienced that myself but I've
heard that's the thing outwards it's
just it makes more sense it's easier to
get at and and you don't have to like
reach underneath like you know possibly
injure yourself doing something like
that I think so that's what I go for
finally Arcadia's zero our key our Cadis
zero said we can hear his dog breathing
yes here was snoring and the last
episode of probing Paul fortunately he
is still over there snoozing but he has
not been snoring this time so got around
that but guys that's all the time I have
for today for probing Paul so thank you
so much for watching this video and of
course if you have questions for me for
next month please post them in the
comment section down below I'm going to
wrap this up and then we get it right
back to benchmarking and overclocking
rise in 5 so I have a video on that
coming very soon and of course if you
want to hit the thumbs up button and
like the video or leave me any other
comments you have please feel free to do
that as well thank you so much for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
