Nevada is brought to you by coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool
how's it go guys have made my way over
to deep pool we're at a suite here in
Caesars Palace it's it's very nice and
deep cool actually has several custom
special edition products that they are
showcasing the quad stellar smart case
the arc 90 as well as a special edition
of their deep cool captain they're all
sort of an orange and silver color
combination and they all have this
tempered glass electro reflective panels
on all the sides and actually looks
really cool so let's start off with a
look at the arc 90 which is right over
here
now the arc 90 has actually been out
already so you might be familiar with it
if you're interested in pricing the arc
90 by default costs about $300 and this
special edition is 200 bucks more so
it's going to run you 500 but you do get
a very uniquely designed chassis which
has tempered glass as you can see on the
left side top as well as the front on
the opposite side over here it's got a
orange finish and you might notice
inside when you look at the fan layout
it comes included with a hundred and
twenty millimeter fan as well as three
hundred and forty millimeter fans the
340 millimeter fans are also connected
to a deep cool captain liquid cooler and
it actually ejects the heat out the
opposite side of the case and there's a
couple ventilation spaces over there in
order to allow that heat to come out and
turn aliy there is a ton of space in
here so these is a very very well-suited
case for water cooling configuration or
something along those lines
tons of locations for mounting SSDs as
well as additional cooling if you want
to and although it is fairly enclosed on
the the top front and side there is
ventilation area in the bottom as well
as across the front it's got a
distinctive looking LED accent highlight
that goes across the top as well as down
the front and the liquid actually flows
through this front tube and there's also
a little flow indicator that's right
down there at the bottom very distinct
looking with this orange and silver
accent finish for the special edition
here and once again five hundred dollars
that's what this one will cost you but I
imagine there's a few people who really
like orange we're going to be into that
now the Quad stellar case is one that
we've actually shown you before
you might have seen this our Computex
coverage and this one they've made even
fancier so this one the the quad seller
by default is going to run you about
$400 this one is 200 bucks more it's
gonna run you at about 600 but you're
getting a massive case with tons of cool
functionality if you're looking at just
the basic PC building functionality
you've got 9 drive bays that are up the
top you can actually just pop those out
and those of course will support 3.5
inch or 2.5 2.5 inch drives and then on
the opposite side you can see where the
motherboard tray goes and down at the
bottom there's PCIe extension riser card
that will allow you to put your GPU up
in the top right quadrant of the case
and that's the basic design idea that
they had with the quad still originally
was to separate all your components out
into different areas of the case so you
have separate cooling chambers for all
of those now for the special edition of
course we have orange accents both
internally as well as externally it's
got a steel frame and then aluminum
finish around these external parts here
so a really nice clean look on those and
then of course more of those tempered
glass electro reflective panels on all
sides which looks really cool but it's
also very difficult to get footage of
all the time now it's got a unique
feature in that these four front panels
here on this version are motorized and
in fact there is an app you can use it
is called quad stellar and you can use
that to handle the motorisation of those
four panels to manually make them pop
out or go back in or you can just have
it monitor the actual temperature of
your system and open or close those as
necessary as your system heats up there
also lighting effects you can control
with that app so the front panel here
will light up and change into various
colors of course depending on what you
choose there and then finally of course
you do have the temperature monitoring
via the app as well so that's pretty
cool you can use that of course to
control the fan speeds so if you want
the fans to be quieter or louder if you
need more cooling you have plenty of
options there so the quad stellar was
already an extremely unique and
innovative case from deep cool and this
version of it just looks absolutely
stunning on Imagine for folks with deep
pockets and again who really liked the
color scheme of the orange with the
silver accents are going to be really
into this next up is the special edition
captain 240 X are
g/b so we're maintaining RGB LED
lighting in the pump block unit that's
down at the bottom but of course you can
see this one's finished and again the
silver and orange color scheme now you
might notice the fan blades on this one
are actually one one spinning and one's
not that's by design they specifically
set that up so you could take a look at
the fan blades when they're not spinning
because there's dual fan blade design
that D cool made up themselves and as
you can see they've also got orange
blade orange fan blades on the fans as
well as orange accent corners
there's orange sleeving on the tubing
going down to the pump block unit itself
and unique thing about this is this is
apparently at least for now the only way
that you can get a deep cool bracket
adapter for tr4 so if you want to put a
deep cool captain 240 X onto a thread
ripper builds you're going to need to
get this one specifically because this
custom-made bracket that they did at the
bottom is only going to be available
with this specific unit there's no
change to the pump and block at all they
said they're getting adequate cooling
out of that with the existing design but
it is nice that you can now have some
threader for compatibility there as well
speaking of thread ripper compatibility
here is risin the final item that we're
gonna take a look at today this is an
air cooler and this is specifically
designed for AMD sockets so it will work
with thread ripper tr4 and it will also
work with rise in CPUs if you're on a m4
and comes with brackets that are
available for both of those it's an air
cooler design it's of course got RGB LED
lighting as well on the V or the xsheet
bracket that's across the fan as well as
across the top of the cooler itself it
looks like you got six six millimeter
heat pipes down there at the bottom
helping to efficiently move heat from
the copper cold plate down at the bottom
up into the fin array and this is a
custom designed cold plate on there so
there's a bit larger to give you more
contact area if you're working with a
thread ripper build also real quickly
wanted to mention the price of the
captain 240 X if you buy this the normal
version of this it's a hundred and ten
dollars the special edition is thirty
bucks more $140 is what that will cost
you and then for the fries and over here
that is going to be seventy nine ninety
nine or eighty dollars and hopefully we
can get an idea of the performance of
this because I
like air coolers and it's nice to have
more options especially forthe Red River
but guys that's gonna wrap it up for my
coverage here at the deep cool suite
from CES 2018 of course a huge thank you
to my sponsors deep cool of course as
well as Coolermaster enter Max and ocz
Toshiba stay tuned for more coverage
from Las Vegas Nevada hit the thumbs up
button if you enjoyed this video of
course and there's more available in the
playlist down below so check it out
thanks for watching we'll see you next
