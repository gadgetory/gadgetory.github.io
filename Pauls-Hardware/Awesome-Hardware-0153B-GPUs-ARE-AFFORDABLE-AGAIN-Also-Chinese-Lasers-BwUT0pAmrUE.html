100% it's up again which is a shame
because it's such a delicious beer well
you can't really enjoy it like a regular
naso fizzy fizzy alright we are live hi
everyone hi
probably just burpees at first yeah it's
probably one of the greatest starts to a
show ever well totally within character
so let's let's kick it off
alright word hello everyone this is
awesome hardware it's a live show we
stream every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time to twitch.tv slash
awesome hardware we stream the entire
show and then the show split in half on
YouTube so the first half of episode 153
that you're watching right now was
already streamed to Kyle's channel so if
you missed that you might want to jump
back and watch it because his channel
contains the bulk of the shall we say
tech content I do have some stuff to
discuss today but I'm going to be right
upfront through the center's and let you
know that for this episode in particular
we're gonna be kind of light on details
because I ran out of time prayer the
Devils in the details anyways but it's
fine we do still have holy subjects we
talked about so links to the stuff we
are gonna discuss are down in this
video's description if you want to
follow along with us we're thanks to any
of you who are watching us live or if
you're watching us in the future then
before we get too far you should go and
click the thumbs up button now yeah
before we disappoint you we would like
that we also drink beer while we're
doing the show that's just kind of
tradition so cheers Cheers thanks to any
of you who are joining us thank you
right now we're going through this sour
which is quite sour but it is so good
though oh my goodness if you like really
sour beer and menthe lagonda moon
Flanders style ode Brune American wild
ales with more with more of Morello
cherries is this the brewery unit soon a
on a is from it Luton it on it anyway oh
I'm almost done with mine I made a I'll
drink the risk cuz he's he's more of fan
of ours
also a quick word of warning we do
occasionally use adult language on the
show so if you are offended by that sort
of thing or if you have small children
then please turn this off right now
bollocks okay as demonstrated by
catalyst that's great I warned you you
warned you all right
before we get into the meat of today's
show such as it is a quick plug for our
stores pulsar Burnett is my store yep
check it out you can buy stuff if you
buy stuff during the show we'll shout
out your name at the end of the show
sure will and also the word Johnson
which makes perfect sense we exploit
t-shirts are super super hot right now
selling out quickly I also got some mugs
of Pike glasses through some desk mats
and mouse pads Kyle's store you can also
buy stuff from bit tech slash store oh
yeah is his and it's also oh yeah
high-quality merch so thanks to all of
you guys who support us by shopping in
our stores and we really hope you enjoy
the stuff that you buy and that you
drink many drinks out of it or wear many
clothes of it or that sort of all the
above all right I was trying to do
segments for my half of the show and I
realized everything's kind of just a
mishmash it's a bunch of segments on
when I was gonna do many segments but
I'm not prepared with my lower thirds if
I was though it would be tales from
space whose me starting with sure it's
not only enough we'll just pretend we
have good imaginations so let's go over
this story real quick what is that a
massive object devastated Uranus a long
time ago and it never fully recovered
hahaha oh you know whoever wrote this
article knew exactly what they were
typing for the headline they knew
exactly I know this is the high point of
the show or point this out - this is the
high point of the trip it never fully
recovered neither did Uranus neither -
here it's just thank you Mike Wiener for
talking about Uranus to sum up sum up
Uranus
is rotating and a very strange axis so
they're talking about there was probably
a significant impacts that caused the
tilt that caused the the sideways
spinning of Uranus so that's why it
probably happened a long time ago and
that is why to this day Uranus is still
still heavy still having a hard time
just just just walking right we are 5
next segment the next mini segment I can
like update oh that was it that was the
mini yes I'm doing each article is a
segment next mini segment we net
neutrality net watch net watch many many
net watch here we have perhaps yeah I
mean there's different ways you can
explain this to to draw a closer or
looser ties to the net neutrality stuff
recently but Comcast's Xfinity mobile
has announced new restrictions on their
video video quality and hotspot speeds
so to be clear this is Xfinity Mobile
which is Comcast's MVNO which is
available to the company's home internet
customers and it runs on the verizon
network so what kind of video quality so
Comcast is already paying Verizon for
data in this case but what is that you
know they're quality they're restricting
to conserve data they are restricting
video quality to 720p yeah over over
cellular for free that's they might
charge I'm sorry for free no that wrist
you can't - for 80 my bad for 80 oh god
yeah that's even worse what video
quality will soon be restricted to 480
720 is now like the premium tier oh dog
dog oh shit dog
that's that's really crack 480 480 720 I
was like hey that's great by but no 7
720 is now the premium tier that's
ridiculous
sorry about the dog barking it'll be
over in just just a moment just a moment
okay so yeah 720 is not the premium tier
if you like call and bitch or complained
it can add you onto a temporary thing
that will give you 720 video for now but
they're gonna start charging for it it
will eventually charge an extra monthly
fee for 720 HD resolution cuz you know
they try to try to complete 720 and 1080
and call them both a that's ridiculous
some of the flagship phones have
resolutions beyond 1080 now
yeah and 10 a and 10 he's just not even
gonna be a thing at all for for it even
worse than that image there hotspot
feature which has previously been usable
is now going to be pretty much unusable
if you have the $45 unlimited plan there
capping the data transfer speed for
hotspot usage to 600 kilobits per second
what's 600 yes that may be your tweet
will load not even 1 megabits Oh super
useful for hot spotting to something
something like a hello my way so I
wouldn't say hi to my way I bachelor
speeds on my plane yeah sometime walk
that's pretty horrible so way to go
Comcast
oh my baby this isn't raging very
exciting super easy so this is the oh
joy segment article I guess it could
also be oh joy do you want to go that
route but oh we're being treated well by
our internet service providers good all
right give me some good news
Paul not yet not yet I'll wait not yet
hang in there
what happened hang in there slugger oh
oh that's why trying to update the lower
thirds I was gonna that watch what's
next
next is next maybe this would be enjoy
be phony news phony everyone oh my god
really custom thumbnails oh these are
all old lower thirds so I've no
recollection of info that we did phony
news before three once Samsung phones
have been spontaneously texting your
photos to random contacts without your
permission no harm no foul yeah I'm not
a big deal no worries I'm sure no one
has any incriminating images on their
phone that they wouldn't want randomly
sent to a random person on your contract
list contact list first spotted by
Andrew is Android central covered by
Gizmodo people have been complaining
about it on reddit's of course Samsung
spoke person told the verge that it is a
we're aware of reports technical teams
are looking into it and the Galaxy S 9
and s9 plus devices are affected so if
you only their most popular phone you
have a Samsung Galaxy S 9 RS time plus
and you think it's been sending random
photos to people on your contact list
call 1-800
advice and scream there's some
speculation as to what the actual cause
of this is RCS messaging update pushes
that t-mobile has done recently for
example but it has not been pinpointed
how how like complex of a bug for it to
actually like pick a photo from your
photo album and text it to a random
person it sounds a go by it's not a hack
like hackers have something to do it
yeah I mean I think it it totally sounds
like malicious in the sense but like the
it doesn't see the article doesn't seem
to indicate it's malicious it seems to
be more like some strange overlap
between the phone itself the carrier the
permission of certain apps and
everything if you are affected then the
immediate solution to prevent this
happening is to revoke the Samsung
message apps permission
to access storage and then the app won't
be able to access storage to send your
files or your pictures after random
people yeah but what kind of what kind
of linkages does that revoke you from at
the same time I'm sure there's other
useful things that prevents have rate
but there you go so weird
next up China is some frickin lasers a
laser powered rifle actually here's some
fierce looking Chinese soldiers it's a
similar has similar dimensions to the
ak-47 according to the South China
Morning Post
it is the Z kzm 500 and it can set a
person on fire with lasers from about
half a mile away
yes 800 meters 800 meter distance can
burn through a targets clothes and skin
and if their clothes are flammable set
them on fire reportedly weighs about
three kilograms or six point six pounds
its caliber of 15 millimeters powered by
rechargeable lithium batteries nice is
returnable you can use batteries from
your vape and they ship rule one battery
charge gives you a thousand zaps so that
can set a thousand people on fire to say
or I guess you can - second - second
pulses that's what it was what it shoots
out it is described as a non-lethal
weapon oh yeah because being lit on fire
is non-lethal I guess it depends on how
flammable your clothing and other others
wait what what clothing is flammable I
know I would probably know this look
cotton regular cotton or fleece or wool
anything soaked in kerosene that's what
I'm thinking like that's that's the only
thing I would consider is usually what I
wear who was wearing clothing that's
considered flammable why would anyone
wear that yeah I think I think this is
the picture of the actual weapon oh my
god that looks way bigger than the ones
in the other picture well cuz it's got a
laser sister's got a big focusing no so
that wasn't the actual in gun that they
were flat oh that first one was just the
stock photo okay like Chinese soldier
looking mad or
whatever is this it this one so many
distracting photos that's different they
look way different yeah that looks this
one looks way less intimidating it's cuz
it looks like aunt ism it looks like one
of those graphics cards that they made
to pretend to pretend that gun that TSA
would stop you for gigabyte gigabyte did
that I don't know if they did it with
their GPUs but they at least do it with
their heatsinks yeah my motherboards not
idea if you're traveling something to
consider I suppose if you're planning on
traveling to China I mean a check for
lasers sure I guess it saves ammo
exactly but then again it is made in
China so who knows if it'll I usually
work all right next up for my next mini
segment what is it this game games
report game is report whoo game sport
yeah yeah that's so probably a lot of
you have played pub G playing ons
battlegrounds sure battle royale mode
hundred people drop down to an island
everyone fights each other and so one
person remains the victor yep been there
more recently has been has been eclipsed
in popularity by fortnight yep also
battle royale mode fortnight is actually
a game that you can play outside of the
battle royale mode but because the
Valerie I'm out is free a lot of people
have been playing it it's it's it's a
bit more streamlined of a game different
style when it comes to urns and to the
artistic you know the pub geez is a
little bit more on the realistic side
fortnight's a little bit more on the and
that cartoony style for tonight's
finished it's a finished game for
tonight's finished and has been I had
continually hasn't had stuff added to it
so that's led to a lot of popularity
also it has the whole building thing you
can build stuff
sure but everyone's always on the i
keeping their eye out for what is next
on the horizon so Mavericks is they're
on their hat into the ring with a 1000
player battle royale yes
exactly what this is I can't even win
like a hundred and fifty person battle
royale this is exciting
why would I ever want to make it harder
for myself well with more people there's
perhaps a slightly more of a chance that
you will not die slightly as quickly I
don't know I'm just and how big is that
map gonna have to be to be thousand
people ah it's gonna be a huge huge map
pretty pretty big I mean if it's gonna
support all those people and not have
people get bored or something times are
gonna tank or matchmaking is gonna be a
bitch it says it's a vaguely defined
MMORPG experience so there's a town in
it called the capital of X as a lobby
for a Last Man Standing match a lot like
pub G you can customize your character
upgrade weapons banks shops auction
houses and a range of quests giving NPCs
the Capitol's part of persistent world
launches in 2019 and then what you do
beyond and then I guess there's
apparently other stuff beyond battle
royale so maybe there's a persistent
world that you can hang out in and do
upgrades and stuff and then you can drop
in to battle royale mat matches with a
thousand people a thousand people also
seems to indicate maybe it would last a
longer time if you're good yeah I would
die just as quickly
maybe I mean obviously yeah there's
gonna be a bunch of people who just die
right away but then you go and play
another game or something but if it
lasts longer than maybe there's more you
know potential for progression or micro
progression throughout the game maybe
many of the staff from this game have
worked on runescape as well as EVE
Online so does seem to have some
developers behind it with some some
experience yeah I'm special OS is the is
the 3d engine looks like it's gonna be
first person first person apparently
yeah and that I don't know much more it
says for aiming for closed beta at
August 400 players battle royale mode
launches later this year followed by the
one
in person matches and finally the
persistent world and MMO part of it in
2019
I wonder or how prevalent battle royale
is going to be for the next few years
like I wonder if it's just gonna be like
if it's a flash in the pan like super
hugely successful and popular and then
it's just gonna be like over or if it's
if it's like here to stay for a while
and like all the most anticipated games
in the next five years are gonna be
battle royale
I bet there's lots of game developers
who are asking that exact same question
yeah guess we'll have to wait on their
their move it seems like a potential for
like a bit of a flooding or inundation
with battle royale mode games because of
all the ones that have been announced
recently or that are coming out yeah so
let's see a lot of times for a game it
comes down to like popularity and are a
lot of people playing it and can I join
and jump into a game really quick and
play sure so that's a factor to consider
as well I just know I'll always be
better than oh probably okay let's move
on to our next actual segment thank you
for joining me for this mini I liked it
quick segment of news it was like a
little blitz round news blitz around
here somehow I got all the lower third
Sunday next a sword fight oh we haven't
done sir defect for a while we have no
we haven't so um these are quick
questions that popped into my head
these aren't as tech related so just
point that out either but Kyle and I
with sword fight take two opposing sides
of a controversial topic and we're gonna
start off with something just pretty
pretty simple and straightforward our
people fundamentally good or evil hmm
buddy this is an important question
actually we all asked so let me pick the
penis emoticon
now you can't damn it that is for the
fans that's that's for the hosts
I'm gonna say that people are
fundamentally evil evil there will
always be evil think so in this world
yeah
cells exactly the example I was thinking
of thank you for pointing that out Paul
see so no sure it's not what you meant
but no people are fundamentally assholes
and we have to learn to find the good in
ourselves because my real answer is that
we're fundamentally both so it doesn't
really matter in my opinion which one I
choose but I'm gonna choose evil because
it sounds more sinister and I'm
fundamentally evil so that's what an
evil person would take I think evil just
makes the most sense I think we're more
evil than we are good and which is why
there's more hate and corruption and
destruction in the world than there is
good deeds at least that's those that's
that's what we are fed spoon-fed on the
news and online feel like we have a
certain fascination with evil which is
partially why usually bad stuff makes
headlines and good stuff rarely does it
bleeds it leads if it bleeds it leads
thank you very much Paul couldn't have
said it better myself so yeah everything
else is just fake news your turn all
right obviously since you chose evil I
choose good but I'm happy for that
because that's what I would have chosen
anyway because Kyle no matter what
happens and no matter what you say it's
it's all garbage and you're full of shit
and a good person I can prove it I can
prove it right now because what are we
doing right now we're doing it live
we're live streaming and we're drinking
some beer having a good time and it's
like the two of us we don't have a crew
here or anything like that yep progress
you can you can look at the past 2000
years of humanity's existence on this
earth and there has been progress there
is less crime now than there was in the
past is less chance of just randomly
dying from some stupid thing
there's at least some semblance you know
obviously the world is not perfect but
this in in in most places there's some
semblance of law and order mass
shootings than ever before in history
you're obviously detracting from that
point that's because you're evil
fundamentally but that's all right on
the whole though all of the good people
the good nice and friendly people
balance out assholes like you and make
it so that people on the whole our
friend immensely good and because that
arc of history veers towards goodness
when it comes to the people in the world
overall even though yes there's shitty
crappy stuff like all the stuff Kyle
talked about everything gets better a
little bit at a time that's because
there's more good people than there are
evil people it's gonna keep happening
that way I'm sure eventually we'll all
be perfect beings and create our own
little heaven on earth no it's never
gonna be perfect Kyle that's a fantasy
that you try to set up there as an evil
person to be like look at this fantasy
it's never gonna happen but that's
because we're evil people like obviously
nothing's ever going to be perfect Kyle
but we're just gonna keep trying to be
good people and live our lives and do
good things and maybe that'll make your
life a little bit better maybe then
you'll be a little bit less of a dick
sounds sounds kind of pessimistic Paul
to think that there's never gonna be a
perfect world it must be the evil in you
you're an asshole we got to see what the
big s see what the fans think about this
one all right well I prevent them from
poisoning poisoning their minds with
your nonsense all right results my
money's on the wiener
the Wiener wins 37 percent of people of
my evil inner finally evil way glows 104
votes Wow well I guess I have to change
my perspective and world view just a
little bit here things got a bit more
bleak and depressing say if the Wiener
voter is here I feel like the Wiener
voters are fundamentally good so that
fundamentally Yvette Tali should really
be added to mine know all the all the
dick drivers are evil which means I have
they're all evil 64% of the vote no I'd
like to be and unique their users
puppies or kittens Kyle puppies or
kittens ottoman this discussion must be
had this choice must be made
we have puppies we have kittens we must
choose which is better okay you you go
first I go first
puppies obviously Kyle there's no other
choice besides puppies puppies are cute
they're loyal they have a little wet nut
noses and they will come and like lick
your face and stuff they're always clean
and they often travelens in little
groups little groups of puppet puppies
and they kind of like to travel in packs
yeah little packs of puppies that move
along and they bring joy to the people
who see them and I think once this whole
YouTube thing is dried up for me I think
what we're gonna do my wife and I is
we're gonna have a puppy we went to a
cat cafe in Japan yes we're gonna do
like a puppy a puppy farm like you're
gonna be no one or no that's that's
gonna be whoa that's what we have so
like people will come and pay money and
then I can sit with like a bunch of
puppies and then the puppies will all
come around and be cute and stuff and
endorphins what what happened I was like
it's pretty low that yeah exactly yeah
how to keep them from growing up
economical is a froyo a bar puppy bar
that's what I'm since it's really it's
one of the life goals I have I have
lined up the genius yep all right so
kittens kittens obviously because I feel
like I feel like puppies are way smarter
which makes kittens so much better cuz
they're dumb as hell and they do really
stupid things for entertainment and
there are pier amusement it's just
absolutely hilarious to see kittens
chase a laser pointer around the room
and you can kind of like leave the laser
pointer off off the edge of a cliff like
a little or a staircase or something the
cat and just watch something just inside
to eat shit it's the most hysterical
thing it's probably some of my fondest
memories with my my two cats as I was
raising them
kittens own the Internet the greatest
gift from whatever God you do or don't
believe in the Internet has chosen
kittens cats in general as their as its
mascot and I stand by what the Internet
holds true and dear kittens also will
destroy everything you love so they give
you a further appreciation for all the
things in life that you will inevitably
see wasted and burnt to the ground by
their adorable little you have an
interesting spin on some of these hey
I'm just keeping it real man aspects of
kittens have I've been through I've been
through the trenches of cat ownership
sounds like hell but totally all the way
yeah it's me and cat not me and puppy
dad that is true alright I'm switching
to the double charlatan
double charlatan double charlatan which
is a double India Pale Ale double dry
hopped bigger happier citrus is a loyal
citrus ear the this one was double is
also double India this is a double IPAs
double IPAs mus very interesting is it
baby with galaxy hops
I need a rinser here that's happy I suck
at video games because I never have time
to play them that's that's obviously the
reason why if I did not have a life or
if I just didn't work 70 hours a week on
a stupid YouTube channel and I could
just game if I was a twitch streamer
instead do you want any of this I'd
probably be a lot better dangerous first
yeah I'm only half thumb screw down
alright let's see what people think
about the puppies our kittens battle
alright yeah I think this is gonna be
important puppies wins Oh yet what oh
yeah Kyle oh my god internet survey
shows puppies exactly bully
is predicted puppies are superior I'm
glad that's been proven now I actually
agree with that I would have said
puppies two cats suck I'm not a cat
person I don't mind I don't mind cats
but it's like in very short bursts you
know it's like if there was a cat all
the time it would get on my nerves
okay my final thank you today final bit
here
Kyle already mentioned this on his half
of the show opinion she talked about an
article which is derived from this one
which is on digitized comm about
graphics cards prices expected to drop
in July this is very good news very very
good news indeed gigabyte had something
to do with this they told people that
they were expecting prices to go down
blah blah so okay we're gonna shop for
graphics cards let's do it right now
live excited live let's buy one we're
gonna check out Amazon first what should
we look at I was like the gtx 1070 is
sort of an yeah nice middle ground that
would be my my go-to as well Amazon's
drill-down options suck um on Amazon
you're they're so stupid yeah it's not
like the power search on Newegg GTX 1070
all right I'm gonna come down in price
you go in for around 400 bucks now price
low to high all right we got the msi gtx
1070 the mini little guy for 110 dollars
that makes sense
babies with Amazon Prime right now the
minis usually run into the lower clock
speed so tax compact one that many is
actually pretty good because it's it's 4
in 20 large for a mini and I don't think
they they they don't drop the the clock
speeds as much but you can buy it you
can buy a 1074 410 to 435 in hundred
bucks a few months ago yeah six to seven
hundred bucks a few months ago for the
1070 I don't know what the 1070 peaked
at rx 580 though
I mean he should be your own hello to
low to high and of course there's gonna
be all these non rx5 ages here
dammit Amazon you suck rx5 70 here's a
584 gig for 270 see that's not bad and
the four gigs should be 200 yeah well
that was the frame oh that was all I
thought that was a 580 sorry huh
it is a 580 but it's the four gigs by me
oh yeah you're right let's look a new
egg just cuz there drill-down options
are better wait components graphics
cards compete at desktop graphics cards
alright let's see what what new egg has
the 594 why new egg only please and
lowest price Wow
alright so a cake 500 for $250 that's
pretty good that's reasonable I had to
Curt Curt right it's on sale it ends in
four hours
oh alright well so is it still in stock
get a wall top yeah it's still in stock
nice shape really 10 20 bucks over MSRP
and yeah it's a custom version from
power color so that's where it should be
I've reviewed that card mate actually we
that's the card we donated to sell I
believe - I bet he's still using metal
all right what's 1080i a 1080i is still
still seven yeah better than a thousand
yeah better than thousand still still
expensive though yeah okay and for our
budgets our budget conscious folk and
City try the 1060 let's see what can we
get a six gig for three gigs look around
you 13 to 30
six gig for 280 okay now that's not in
stock though
what's in stock to 300 hundred yeah yes
1066 gig still still only on the
expensive side right now but you know
some good news for that 1070 though and
a lot more I mean there's this more more
right now and it's and it's a very
beginning of July right now it's only
July 3rd mm-hmm
so perhaps as the month proceeds we'll
have better prices for other cards too I
reckon that's the truth I hope so yeah
oh but I was like what is oh it's a hero
oh yeah heroes write down their hero
it's curled up at our feet what a nice
little ottoman alright uh so guys it's
let's jump over and answer some Q&amp;amp;A
questions that people have been sending
in thanks to all you guys who have
happened to have donated to our stream
starting answer Carl Hall five Canadians
are you both coming to LTX with Jay and
Jerry no no no no we're not I just got
too much stuff going on around that time
yes next week we were invited and we
declined yeah we're like now you come to
ours that we don't have we we greatly
declined Visia thank you so much for
this invitation we're honored you know
just so much grateful we will however be
a Comic Con oh yeah we're gonna should
mention that this is just a
spur-of-the-moment opportunity that
landed into my in Paul's lap that we
took the last minute we're gonna be a
comic-con San Diego comic-con so if you
guys are gonna be there we might be
doing a meet-up I stopped to talk to you
about this after the show
Dayton Times still not sure but we will
be at Comic Con at the land area there's
gonna be a gaming PC land area just to
sort of familiarize people with like PC
gaming and just freaking gave him stuff
tournaments and stuff Paul and I are
gonna hang out there with Steve oMG and
some other people and stuff for short
but more details later we might do it I
mean up be cool to see you guys then but
LTX know nothing's here
thank you very much Carl thanks Carl
Philip Rams a to the brand's Rams yeah
ddr4 Rams 10
hey guys love the show I was watching
some nostalgic Newegg vids this past
week ah
any chance of doing another gold build
or better yet a platinum build ooh the
gold builds I feel like the gold builds
I haven't seen as many gold products out
there yeah that's gonna require some
modification as a team yeah I think that
requires some definite some mods it's
definitely worth because I know they're
shot at but I don't think we have
anything like actually planned right a
platinum build maybe like silver okay I
guess you can get a silver build is
pretty easy to do I've done silver
builds in the past and they're not too
bad
but gold I think is something to shoot
for but it would would require a lot of
aftermarket work yeah Kolbe our $4.99
keep it up thank you cold we shall yes
we shall help us keep it up everyday
irish h $5 are you excited about 802
1011 ax will you upgrade your network
because in the new version i usually use
just hardwired Ethernet for all those
systems that I do uploading and
downloading with so Wi-Fi is not a huge
concern for me but a toe-to-toe 11 8 ax
is definitely that next that next year
that's pushing Wi-Fi forward speeds and
reliability and all that though I've
been enjoying it or 2.11 a/c yeah I'm
probably a little bit more excited about
upgrading my network here to 10 Gigabit
Ethernet them then 802 that 11 X what
it's amazing yeah
Matthew GUI our sabbatical year 15
Canadians got a CPA exam coming up on
Sunday going to listen to this awesome
show in the background does I study
Cheers if you can manage to study
efficiently while we're talking in the
background yeah kudos see you man that
is that it's like a superpower I hope we
don't like detract at all from you
learning things the threat our whole
show yeah it's my reto that our whole
show we should just be like yeah there's
some accounting knowledge we can whisper
oh my got a naked woman and I don't know
anything about accounting but good luck
on the exam Matthew pup Shepherd $5.00
speaking of bondage
right on cue spy ha ha my YouTube ha ha
hey but besides that I hope you're all
well yes how much for
brakes slash rotors cost in California
it's 624 dollars here how much for
brakes and rotors California I don't
know off the top I have not had those
replaced you know like in like decades
so I couldn't say if it also depends on
your vehicle and yeah like that so yeah
it's hard to say I don't know I don't I
don't know they wouldn't be cheap though
I could tell you that they wouldn't be
cheap but and I defer getting them all
then I couldn't really tell you as far
as comparing them to what your rates are
but and we're also not really car people
yeah he'll be here
wishbone five dollars and 55 cents you
must be related to pup Shepherd um I was
doing uber last night ran into an AMD
employee and he said that the
playstation 5 CPUs are being made here
in Austin Texas but no more info sadly
that makes sense because AMD has a lot
of facilities in Texas one other excuse
designed perhaps I don't think that if
they do fabs right it might have you
fabs but maybe he meant that they were
designed or incepted in Texas and then
outsourced to somewhere like Taiwan yeah
that makes sense but I would be
surprised a dark room game RJ five
dollars all assume the reason Kyle keeps
passing over my pin my PC entries is
because my pit PC is too perfect that is
like most likely no joke that's probably
what it is I don't really see any room
for improvement there's not much room
for commentary in that sense and so I
just don't pick it because it's not
gonna be good for the show or for the
viewers so consider it a compliment if I
have been skipping over your pit my PC
entry consecutively for the last 37
weeks or whatever it is but what's
Stephen Hill what up bro $10 been a
while since I caught you guys live your
audience isn't fit them's fighting words
I'm moving to Austin in the coming
months hold down the California fort
actually yeah there is a exception to
every rule and Stephen is definitely one
of them Stephens been at several of our
meetups so far and he is by far the most
fit person I have seen at any party even
Steve is rocking them guns I had that
boys stashed chisel that have stone
built built like a sculpture so you are
absolutely right Stephen thank you very
much for breaking breaking the norm
and for and for just being sexy thank
you very taken up all the athleticism
for the rest of us literally picking up
our slack
Phoebe Java divided re I remain my
three-year-old 650 watt PSU to Coulson
Coulson and they sent me a 750 watt in
return for being a royal customer noise
cheer chill
gentlemen come hi cheers TV thanks baby
preciate it well that's really lovely
that's an extra hundred watts yeah Oh
hundred it's nice
this little John would say what crappy
let's go ten dollars miss you man have
either of you heard of the Audis mobius
USB alternatively Bluetooth wireless
play in our hand headsets with 3d
positional audio and upgradeable
microphone if so either of you
considering a review video I believe I
have heard of that product name before
I've definitely heard of it today I have
not tried that product Oh wasn't this
wasn't this a Kickstarter I don't know
you do that segment I feel like this was
definitely yes this was like some
revolutionary yeah the head trekking
virtual yes this was supposed to be like
the headset that you use or the
headphones you use for VR where it's
like fully 3d spatial sound or ever yes
I do remember doing an article in this
and any positional audio I would love to
do a review on that actually it sounds
kind of cool just because it seems so
unique so come at me bro I think I
already
maybe you've deemed me really you're all
get in touch me though thanks crafty and
also for the donation man pup Shepherd
10 bucks once again speaking of
buffering you can tell when someone has
bad internet because when you get busy
with them and they pause you ask what's
up
he says I'm trying this new thing I saw
online buffering
I can't tell if if that was if that was
a joke or or if I if I misread the
punchline
or I don't know this is awkward if your
lock word I'm sure I'm sure it was a
really funny joke pup that I just I
probably on me I probably didn't deliver
it this is the way that you deliver it
was very important to me cow
whether you described it in your mind
I'm sorry I'm so sorry I'm sure it was
hilarious
Scot Dilbeck six dollars and 66 cents
daddy missed you girls dearly thanks
Kyle an awesome harder is back on
schedule guys oh we're glad to be here
once again thanks Scott cheers to you
brother Demetri TV t $9.99 I love you
guys quick question is upgrading from a
4770k to a new CPU worth for just gaming
at 1440p and 140 at 144 Hertz for the
1080i the way I look at it not really
yes you would be correct yeah you're
probably fine yeah especially if you're
overclocked a bit yeah it's gonna be
hard for you to pay for Hertz or 144 FPS
or whatever at 1440p anyway even with a
1080i in a lot of cases 4770k I mean
games are still very much GPU bound so
even if you're not even overclocking
you're still fine
leo el primo seven dollars and seven
cents finally caught the show from the
start y'all are awesome Kyle when you
cut up the Mesha 5c to fit the Capitan a
io 120 millimeter fans was there any
issue actually no I'm glad you asked
that because there was no issue
whatsoever
temperatures everything's fine even
noise noise seems fine like it didn't
make it louder at all so what he's
talking about is the mesh if I see on
the inside of that front panel there's
like this weird kind of like plastic
frame that's just sort of like branches
out in all kind of directions like a
tree mm-hmm and it was interfering with
the two front fans that I had placed
they were radiator fans that I actually
had to mount on the outside of the frame
because my graphics card was interfering
otherwise and so I had to basically take
wire cutters and clip off all the
plastic frame on the inside of that
front panel to make room for those fans
but once that's out of the way
the front panel fits on just fine and
it's just pure 100% mesh at the front
panel and it's just getting raw intake
and there's no issue no issue temps are
great acoustics are great so can we do
the same thing I would recommend it and
then we go into the donations from
Paul's 1/2 yeah you can Thompson $5 too
much head drinking some heady topper
myself
hey we're not drinking we had some heavy
topper on the show what's funny good and
that was some good stuff
we are drinking once again the sour this
is the LeGrande Demond from who did
Hyundai I think and I'm drinking the
double Charlatans double India Pale Ale
House that one by the way from a
Maplewood no Bob Maplewood Brewing
Company in Chicago IL yeah it's pretty
tasty noise for an IPA or an IBA right
on thank you very much Ethan Philip Rams
once again $10 mr. Paul with you being
just stickler for people having their
pieces on the floor ever thought about
having a shirt design with the PC off
floor theme hmm
that's a good idea Phil I like that
thank you my my most recent idea for a
t-shirt on my store has been in
development for like six months so once
that one does come out it will be nice
to have a follow-up for it and I think
that will be it I'll keep that in mind
thank you thank you very much it's like
you see on the desk shirt followed by PC
off the floor shirt and then you could
just wear them in Italy I hope people
see me both both times or if I wear them
both in the same video that be thank you
have a PC PC on the desk jacket it's
really hot in here and take it off and
then your shirt size PC on the floor off
the floor
I don't like it alright anyways I'll
start brainstorming yes thank you for
all these genius ideas fellow Irish H $6
have you all been have you all seen
those put in key caps put what the hell
are pudding pudding apps what okay quick
Google search will yield all of my
wildest fantasies I'm store
Oh am pbt putting keycaps what I don't
understand
oh is it just is it is it just like
they're mostly transparent but only the
very tops of them are are black I see
so it just gives you more illumination
it just illuminates more of the actual
key cap is like 85 85 percent
transparent only the very top surface
top layer is so it just allows for more
like transmitting more bleed through um
I don't know I honestly would have to
see them in person I'm not a huge fan of
them from the pictures like right off
the bat they don't look all that great
to me but again it's one of those things
you probably see it in person to really
appreciate it interesting though thanks
for putting that on my radar
yeah even heard of those Vignesh but

that sounds that would that would have
been what I did if they weren't in the
area
yeah and invited us out to watch
fireworks with them and so mainly
because one of our dogs
Noorie has recently had surgery on her
leg again so she needs to be closely
monitored and she can't go out and about
too much and dogs don't like fireworks
either and yeah the dogs get pretty
nervous and worried on 4th of July cause
of all the loud noises and everything so
right being around to comfort them and

Lutheran californ Canadians
10 Canadian is 10 Gigabit Ethernet if
providers keep throttling it because I
transfer files from different between
different computers on my home network
yeah and I'll often record stuff out
here in the garage and transfer it on to
this system and then I'll transfer it
back to the editing system yeah and and
so having that be faster be useful for
me yeah if it's local than ISPs don't
have a hand in it Mac Shadow $10 quick
best PC gaming 4k TV ballpark $1,200 the
piece best PC gaming 4k TV going on the
LG nano cell TVs you can get them for
around $1,200 actually and they have
very low input lag on their gaming mode
I've reviewed two of them with 2017 and
2018 models and both of them are the
best TVs I've ever game
period for PC there very good James bro
$5 ok I need an upgrade from a risin 5
1400 what should I upgrade to Asus Prime
be 350 pro motherboard 16 gigs of ram
any help that rise in 7 1700 has been on
sale for some pretty low prices
relatively recently so I would keep an
eye out for one of those yourself 8
cores at a bargain price you don't need
to necessarily pay the money for the
resin to stuff yeah it's not a huge
upgrade for second generation second
generation right Beauty they in for that
upgrade path MB sixty seven thirteen
dollars and 37 cents Paul I'm definitely
not in the fit category but I did enjoy
the meetups nope well I did too
every every shape and size counts and be
you preaching to the choir and take Paul
right yeah we're not we don't have
stellar rock body bods but um don't
we're gonna though but we we think baby

can't afford seriously though how about
those ramp race didn't look at ramp
prices no I will I will look at those
later this week though cuz we like not
being depressed yeah

trickling they've been slowly trickling
down not as much as GPUs but yes very
very slowly yeah
dwindling Todd Vance $5 Johnson RGB
edition pimp my PC it's good idea yeah
you know what usually I only go for form
factors were like custom water cooling
but that might be a good category that I
was already doing implementation yeah
good idea Todd although I might have to
require video submissions for that one
just to see any sort of you know moving
effects and stuff like that that's true
that be be very helpful to be fun Steven
Michael thanks for the suggestion Todd
Steven Michael $5 Kyle how do you set up
your hilarious head-to-head death
challenges game / setup by the way best
joke ever 80 press what finished the
equation yes that's a I have to give
credit to Lyle for that one I did not
come up with that how do I set up my
hilarious head-to-head def miss
challenges that's pretty vague I don't
know if you mean in terms of the
hardware it's pretty simple it's just
two PCs you know back to back and we
game on those the cameras we have a
multicam setup I think there's three
cameras in total sometimes four if it's
if there's a special challenge involved
but it's pretty straightforward you know
we do the audio and video sync with all
the cameras Paul is there to experience
it once it was which you can check that
above that episode of it's really fun
it's the best one it's it's it's a lot
of it's a lot of setup it's a lot of
setup stack attack takes probably an
hour and a half to two hours to just set
up for all the props the tables we have
to rearrange and reconfigure the room
but as soon as we say go or action and
we start gaming the whole recording
experience is probably no more than 15
to 20 minutes long because it's it's all
real time we just there's no like
stopping cuts for breaks or whatever we
just played around until it's over which
is about 15 to 20 minutes and then it's
you know another 12 to 15 hours of
editing afterwards so setting up is
setting up and post production
pre-production and post-production are
the most time consuming elements of
stack attack with the actual production
phase surprisingly being the most quick
and simple yang moon choy Hey holy crap
20 bucks sub count Paul yang is a good
buddy of mine from high school Oh yep
thank you yes so thank you that's a very
generous donation of yes you don't have
to do that brother but thank you I
appreciate that

internet issue side about when you get
it when you get it on with somebody on
the internet slow again pup I hope
comedy isn't your first job choice I
hope there's a career path adjacent to
that one that you that you're really
driving home but we love you but I mean
I can't I kind of get it no yeah you
know no I get it too and I think it's
one of those things where I'm just
reading comments so blazingly fast not
expecting them to be jokes so I'm not
delivering them in the way that jokes
should be delivered yes ah so I I
apologize pop for for being a terrible
medium for your late night comedy that's
right um I hope I hope if you comments
with jokes in the future that we can
deliver them better so it more start all
your donations with this is a joke in to
do that like that and them that will
prepare ourselves a little bit more
maybe get through it yes okay we're on
the same page now

really awesome is I might happen
you realize England but the fiftieth all
your donations are on Paul's half
I'm not seeing a sentiment he didn't go
to high school with you I did but how's
the boy feels like I did it feels like
when tae-soo sure you guys will bond
just fine I remember when we were hang
out in the quad and there's like those
girls we'd check out those girls
sometimes for like they never want to
talk to us what fuck you because yeah
the shitty thing is you don't even need
that bonding experience with then all
you need to do is walk gonna be like
remember that one time he gave me a lots
of money and you're instantly closer
than he and I ever worked exactly it's
just not fair
a bond that can never be broken this
blast this capitalistic society
Thank You yang Minh for your generosity
thank you as well Ronny fuck you Ronnie
five dollars RGB is for women who want
to match their PC to the shade of
lipstick they are wearing that day what
in a sense he's right he's talked about
color the world of color is to be used
by people who want to use it for what
they want to use it for I mean yeah and
women of course will often use various
colors to match their makeup or other
types of clothing they might wear or
whatever that is that is accurate that
would be a good way to explain to
perhaps a woman who was giving you shit
for liking RGB right who fits this
scenario not to say all women fall into
this category but I'm sure many of them
do that is an interesting way to look at
it Ronnie and I appreciate your
perspective I do too on perspectives all
