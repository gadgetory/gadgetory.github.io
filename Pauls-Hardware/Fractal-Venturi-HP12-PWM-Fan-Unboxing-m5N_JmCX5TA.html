video this is kind of an impromptu
off-the-cuff one because I wasn't really
planning on doing a video today but then
I got a package in the mail and I was
like I want to do a quick unboxing of
these because what I got is these new
fractal design venturi HP 12 fans I got
six of them total
you heard him 20 millimeters I know her
you broke in one of the cardinal rules
of unboxing because I've already unboxed
one of them but that's okay because I
have six of these so I can unbox one of
the other ones for you guys so go over
some of the specs of these fans some of
the specs of the other fans in this
series and why not also plug one end
into a quick hands-on test let's begin
this unboxing in the traditional fashion
by taking a closer look at the retail
box this is the venturi HP - 12 high
performance computer fan this is a
hundred and twenty millimeter version
here and fractal has actually released
four new fans in the event arees series
this is HP 12 which is a high-pressure
and this is a PWM fan there's also an H
f12 which is 120 millimeter or 12
centimeter high flow fan which is more
optimized for air flow so get to HP's if
you want to use these with a radiator
which is I'm going to do what I'm gonna
be doing gonna be using these in the
arctic panther back there and get the hf
series if you want more airflow for like
intakes and exhausts on the computer
that aren't gonna be right up against a
radiator or something else that requires
high pressure okay apart from that on
the back we have information about the
fans such as dimensions already told you
is 120 millimeter it's got a four pin
fan header because it is a PWM capable
fan and I do appreciate PWM fans because
they can ramp themselves down although
bear in mind you can't ramp them down
infinitely that's why I'm using these
fans in the arctic panther I actually
have some of the ek Vardar the Furious
of our dars which are 3000 rpms and
there's nothing wrong with those fans
inherently however they are quite loud
because they're 3,000 rpm fans I was
going to hit up ek and get some
replacements for those and get the lower
rpm versions but then fractal came out
with these and I was like well let me
give these a shot so that's why I'm
using these so not a slight against TK
in any sense anyway it's a fluid Dino
that's another reason why I really like
these fans I am a big fan haha oh fluid
dynamic bearings I find them to be have
a long lifespan and to stay quite quiet
for the most part three year warranty
150,000 our mean time between failure
and these are 12 volt fans at 0.2 amps
so bear that in mind if you're gonna try
to stack a bunch of these on top of each
other or something like that on the
right side over here we have a couple
different sets of performance metrics
because these are PWM so you have full
speed at 1,800 rpms or you can use the
PWM function to lower their RPMs all the
way down to 400 if you want the least
amount of noise possible so
at 1,800 rpms they move about 60 1.4
cubic feet per minute of air and they
have 2.3 millimeters of h2o static
pressure which is pretty nice at a 31
point 7 DB noise level for 400 rpm
rotational speed here at 15 point 4 CFM
your static pressure goes down to 0.45
but your noise level also goes down to
pretty much inaudible all right what
else what else look it's a fan with a
flappy flappy flap that opens sets
that's rare I don't see those so look
again you got a peekaboo window in here
and then you have a little layout of the
actual fluid dynamic bearing and I
thought that was kind of interesting you
guys want to read this I bet you do the
inner surface of a true f DB bearing is
covered with two sections of small
herringbone grooves when the shaft
rotates which is quite common especially
with products that josh is behind oil is
pushed along those grooves creating two
pressurized oil films between the shaft
and the bearing shell this stabilizes
the rotor resulting in a longer product
life so that's kind of their fancy fluid
dynamic bearing design also it's got a
counter pull magnet in there so when
pushing the air forwards the blades of a
fan are pushed back by an equal force
that's pretty basic physics by adding a
magnet that pulls the shaft in the
opposite direction the stress on the
bearing can be reduced this leads to
more silent operation and a longer life
span so just to summarize this little
section according to fractal you need to
pull the shaft in the opposite direction
and then go ahead and rotate the shaft
and that leads to a nice quiet fan they
also have some optimized design here for
their optimised blade and statwhore
design
that's interesting the noise created
when the blades passed the stat or
struts though the struts okay so the
things that kind of hold the center in
place these things that's what those are
okay so the noise created when the
blades passed the status struts is
significantly reduced by three features
aerodynamically shaped struts including
the wire strut tone defusing notches on
the blade edges and the very wide angle
between the stutter struts and the
trailing edges of the blades that make
sense to you guys sure it does and then
finally I'm doing this completely out of
order but trip wire technology so based
on technology commonly used on airplane
wings the trip wire introduces a layer
of turbulent air near the leading edge
of the fan blade that way sudden
boundary layer separation can be avoided
giving a smaller turbulent layer at the
end of the fan blade this reduces noise
and improves fan efficiency now what the
product out of the box you can see
fractals gone with a fairly unique
design here really something that I
haven't seen before when it comes to
case fans at oh I'm sorry this is the
venturi that's that's made for aerating
one
easy easy mistake to make let's go ahead
and get this out of the box though so
I'll take a look at the accessories that
are included here and fractal has
dropped in a few extra goodies here
aside from the fan itself which I found
a nice and I will also point out to some
of the accessories that come not just
with this high-pressure version but also
which with the hf version so there's the
fan with the HP versions HP 12 or HP 14
if you're going 120 140 millimeters you
get a PWM splitter and I think this is
nice to have because often these are
going to be used on radiators radiators
are frequently two or three fans that
are required and being able to split
that off with the full 4 pin PWM
capability is gonna be nice and that
will help you allocate your fans to fan
headers that might be in your case it
also of course gets mounting screws
typical black screw mounts fan fan screw
mats fan mount screws yes and then of
course the fan itself so taking a look
at the center you might really might
recognize this design just a little bit
in fact I have its counterpart over here
so let's bring that in here to take a
look so this is 140 millimeter fan that
I took out of the Defiant r5 and
the model on this one is actually a
little bit different this is the dynamic
GP - 14 and you'll notice some of the
different things I think this might
still have the FDB bearing in there but
you're not going to have like the rubber
on the outside these are plastic on the
outside you don't get the sleeved cable
as well and these are three pin gives
you voltage control not necessarily the
four pin that the venturi HP - 12 gives
you now a cool thing that they give you
at the hundred and forty millimeter
models that isn't included here because
these are 120 is they actually give you
removable replaceable rubber corners so
these are rubber of course so when you
screw these in the screw is not going to
touch anything that's not rubber so
that's pretty cool but again on 140
millimeter versions they actually give
you some replacement corners they give
you a hundred and five millimeter
mounting space so you can actually mount
the 140s on smaller fan mounts which is
which is pretty cool what else do we
have here of course the cable there we
go
nicely sleeved all in black this is
another nice benefit as opposed to the
Furious bars which have the red cable
which I was gonna have to sleeve these I
think I can leave as is because this is
a decent sleeping job you can see some
heat-shrink there but not terrible by
any stretch and there of course is your
four pin header at the end as well
one other thing to mention since these
are the HP versions and as I already
showed you they come with a little
splitter the hf versions the hf 12 and
HF 14 are not PWM controllable they have
three pin voltage controls so what they
include with those to give you a bit
more options for speed is they include
some resistors some inline resistors
that you can use to lower the RPMs on
those too so whether you're getting the
PWM versions or no you will still have
some level of control over the actual
fan speed and noise generated and now
for a quick demo this is like completely
unscientific and really just like
anecdotal also if I sound further away
now it's because I've actually flipped
my microphone around so it's pointing
forward so when I turn these fans on you
will hopefully be able to hear them or
maybe even not hear them I have two of
the fans connected I'm not using PWM I'm
using this little fan controller here
and this only does three pin voltage
control so I guess this is a voltage
control
test with the PWM fans I have it
connected to a little molex AC adapter
over there going in to control that and
I just turned on and the fans are
spinning I can hear nothing
all right now voltage control still
works with PWM fans I'm going to turn
both of these all the way to max and I'm
max yes this is 1800 rpms and they are
gonna make a little bit of noise so
again this is 100 percent speed this is
full speed moving a little bit closer so
you guys can hear maybe I'll focus too
alright the mic right now is about like
four inches three four inches from these
fans so that's what you guys are hearing
not too bad right again that's a hundred
percent full speed so I'm gonna go ahead
and turn it down at least to the lowest
voltage wise that's metal the whole fan
controller is able to do I'll wait for
the car to drive by car still outside
maybe you guys can hear the car more
than the fans but um all right so here's
them at low speed I can't confirm that
this is 400 rpm but I'm guessing it's
about that much this is as low as the
voltage as metal faint controller would
give them and here they're just they're
just dead so and I'll let you guys
listen for a second yes I can hear
nothing
I hear absolutely nothing okay one last
quick test and that is to see if that's
the lowest voltage provided to these
since they are PWM and I'm not giving
them PWM power there we go
will they spin answer yes so cool even
if you're not connecting these to a PWM
controllable fan controller or
motherboard header through the know that
you can still get nice low rpms out of
them but that's the benefit of PWM as
you still can do voltage control as well
and guys that is just am I gonna wrap it
up so I hope you've enjoyed this little
video my quick demonstration of the
fractal design venturi HP 12 fans again
there's a HP for high pressure 12 and 14
centimeter designs there's also the H F
12 and H F 14 which are high flow
designed for air flow these I'm going to
be installing in the arctic panther back
there I have some work to do on that
because I'm going to need to pull all of
the radiators out don't worry it's not
like a bad thing
was already planning on doing that so
not a huge deal and that video should be
coming up soon I have a couple more
build videos coming to but don't forget
to subscribe to my channel don't forget
to hit that like button go ahead and
check out my store at startup pulsar red
dot net for t-shirts and that kind of
stuff and we'll see you all very very
soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
