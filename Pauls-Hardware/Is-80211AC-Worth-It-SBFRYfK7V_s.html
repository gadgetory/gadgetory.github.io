doing my best to make router sexy I will
start this video off with a confession
as of yesterday I still only had a toe
2.11 n Wi-Fi here in my home it may come
as a shock to many of you who believe
that I am always at the forefront of
technology but I can explain why with
two simple words Gigabit Ethernet I have
cat 6 cable like this running up through
my attic I actually documented this on
an epic episode of pimp my attic a few
months back so check that out if you're
interested it means that all my desktop
PCs here in the garage back in the
computer room are hardwired but that's
not to say that I don't use Wi-Fi here
in my house phones laptops sometimes
even cameras hit up the 2.4 gigahertz
and thye gigahertz bands like 16 year
old groupies at a One Direction concert
but the a total of an N connection
provided by my trusty asus RT and v 6u
router that i've had for a few years now
has always been adequate and yes i
updated the firmware why settle for
adequate though when you can get better
than adequate I decided it was time to
try 802 11 AC so my journey to 802 dot
eleven AC Wi-Fi began when I received
this ten to AC fifteen router based on
the Box you might think it's the ten de
a C 1900 router but no it's the AC 15
the 1900 refers to the six hundred
megabits per second of bandwidth on the
2.4 gigahertz band and 1,300 available
on the five gigahertz band why this
router though it's not necessarily the
fastest in its class and the reviews for
it to be honest you're actually kind of
mediocre but it's pretty damn cheap it's
about 84 bucks right now compared to 120
to 200 for similar models from Netgear
asus d-link and lynxes and it's got a
wired Gigabit Ethernet hub so my wire
LAN should stay intact and up to speed
beyond that if it can deliver consistent
802 mm AC speeds which it should be able
to do if it adheres to the spec I will
be happy
other than dual band 802 11 ac support
the AC 15 also sports a bubbly glossy
black plastic finish which i think is
pretty terrible to be honest 3 antenna
for a MIMO supports Bank of Lights up
here on the front for status and
connectivity indications a Wi-Fi
Protected setup button and a dedicated
Wi-Fi on/off button up here on top which
I do like to have and on the back
there's a power button and a jack a USB
3.0 plug that can be used for network
storage or a network printer and for
wired rj45 gigabit ethernet jacks one
for your wind connection and three for
your LAN connection only three LAN ports
really tenda four is the standard for
gigabit switch I will have you know I am
disappointed so in my opinion a router
should pretty much be invisible
beyond setting it up naming the SSID
something funny like NSA security drone
the promised land or lord of the pings
for more of these hilarious suggestions
please visit the reddit thread linked in
the description and of course using wpa2
encryption at the very least with a very
strong password I don't want to know
what's there or even think about it I
just want it to work I'm just going to
be doing the basic setup with ac15
unfortunately that wasn't too difficult
once it's plugged in just access any
connected pcs web browser and you should
be Auto navigated 210 to Wi-Fi comm
which lets you access the control panel
the AC 15 has a range of features like
cloud access packet prioritization ftp
and VPN support but i've never used
those features on any router and i don't
really plan to now all I want to know
about is speed and I can't really do
some tests on that without some baseline
tests on my existing Asus router my
basic usage tests since I've already ran
them didn't really show any marked
difference between these two routers web
browsing gaming and watching streaming
1080 video all worked just fine apart
from out here in the garage where range
becomes limited particularly on this one
so to speed things up let's just move
straight to the real deal test which is
throughput or data transfer speed
between locally connected devices to put
too fine a point on it I've concocted a
basic real world mixed file transfer
test of about two gigabytes and I'll be
seeing how long it takes to transfer
from one wirelessly connected 802 dot 11
AC laptop to a wired system on the land
also I'm transferring to and from SSDs
so the only limiting factor here should
be the router house you guys lucky we
get to skip straight to the test results
so here you can see on the Left I've got
the living room the bedroom and the
garage being in three locations that I
tested in the living room being about 10
to 15 feet from the router with no walls
in between the bedroom be a little bit
further 20 to 25 feet with about two
walls in the way and the garage is
further thirty to forty five feet away
and there's multiple things in the wall
I kind of summed it up to being about
two walls I tested the asu's as well as
the tenda at five gigahertz
and 2.4 gigahertz I tested both bands I
was doing that 2 gig transfer it makes
file types and then I ran three tests
each time and at the top you can see the
average time as well as calculated out
two megabytes per second so as you can
see the living room tests went pretty
well for the ASIS of course although you
do notice a little bit of a performance
boost of 5 gigahertz note this asterisk
title here that's because the ASIS are
TN five six you and part of the reason
I'm intending to get rid of it is that
it's been freezing up here and there it
was really random it actually hadn't
done it for maybe a month or two but
during the course of the testing I was
able to get it to do it so that's why I
threw that result out when it wasn't
locking up because it was very obvious
when it was it still got this much so
for the rest of the tests I ran through
everything but although bear in mind
once I got here to the garage for the
Asus router the signal was a little bit
too weak on 5 gigahertz to pick up
anything and then on 2.4 gigahertz I was
able to get connect to the network but
it's really unstable it kept dropping
out at most it gave a 12 to 14 min ata
now look at here you'll notice that the
10 does results especially if you're
looking at only 5 gigahertz are pretty
much faster across the board compared to
the the AC Swaggart's in fact almost
doubling of speed from 15 to about 28 or
29 megabytes per second here in the
living room it's definitely slowed down
a lot when I put more obstructions in
between down to 12.1 megabytes per
second and 11 1.1 megabytes per second
the 2.4 gigahertz results though I was
actually pretty disappointed with you'll
note here compared to the the living
room and bedroom tests the speeds were
actually slower on the tender for 2.4
gigahertz than the Asus trade-off there
being that I was able to connect out
here in the garage so I do have results
for the tend out here whereas the ASIS
would just I wasn't even able to run the
test so there you go definitely faster
speeds with the tenda but slower speeds
on 2.4 gigahertz now if you don't do a
lot of file transferring around your
home network then you might think that
802 dot 11ac isn't really necessary and
that could be true but also consider
this a faster router also helps when you
have multiple devices connected to it
this is because a router does not talk
to multiple devices at the same time it
switches off between them one
at a time this means that if each
transmission completes more quickly it
will speed up the queue for all the
other connected devices something to
think about so final thoughts on the
10:00 to AC 15 would be I like that it's
significantly faster on 5 gigahertz and
it definitely has better range than my
old router set up was pretty simple and
I have a new respect for those Wi-Fi
transfer speeds especially when I'm at
close range I don't like that it only
has three gigabit ethernet ports instead
of four it's limited and then it must be
positioned upright on a stand and there
is no wall mount included also if I'm
being picky the design is just pretty
hideous my wife said that it looks like
a cheap person if anyone's feeling that
my biggest concern of course was the
limited 2.4 gigahertz performance and
this is a huge example of how even
industry standard specifications don't
always match up with expected
performance the trade-off is the
increased range which does seem to be
giving me much more stable connections
out here in the garage overall I'm happy
with switching over to 802 that 11ac
with enhanced range again being the most
significant factor and that speed boost
being a bit of icing on the cake what
are you guys using for wireless at home
though have you jumped up to 802 11 AC
are you still using something older
personally I'm going to stick with the
10 to AC 15 for now since it's getting a
job done and it's not locking up like my
old router was but in the future I'm
probably going to be looking at maybe
building a pfsense router of my own
hardware because I'm do that kind of
thing anyway if you enjoyed this video
don't forget to hit that like button
down there also you can use my amazon
link which is in the description for US
and UK if you're shopping for holiday
gifts or whatever else you can also feel
free to visit my store at store Paul's
Hardware net where you can support me by
picking up a shirt or a mug or a pint
glass none of which I have examples of
right here but trust me they're nice
also don't forget to subscribe to my
channel for more tech videos this will
probably be my last router video for the
while but as always thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
