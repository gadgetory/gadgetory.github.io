to Pauls Harbor today this video is
about the best cpu for gaming and I've
done this type of video before and it's
very important at the beginning of any
video where you talk about the best view
for gaming - frame is exactly the terms
by which you are defining what you mean
what I'm talking about today is what I
mean not only just for me but also for
any of you guys who are curious what a
gtx 980ti
SLI configuration needs in order to get
the most frames per second out of the
amount of GPU horsepower that's
available there because let's face it
right now within a reason as far as well
supported from the drivers side from
Nvidia as well as game developers as
well as what you can feasibly drop into
a system and just start gaming with gtx
980ti and two-way SLI is about as high
as you can go yes you can go 3 where 4
wait you're not going to the driver
support you're not going to be able to
actually get any benefit out of games so
there it is and that's what I'm going
with this configuration second reason is
of course that I am currently in
progress of getting all the purse
decided upon for my special
water-cooling build the resurrection of
arctic panther a large pool system that
i originally built a couple years ago
i'm going to be refreshing it and
updating it with two gtx and 1080 is and
I wanted to see what else I should put
in there to make sure that I get the
most bang for buck out of them this is
going to be a gaming specific system so
I'm not as concerned about doing other
stuff
although gaming of streaming at the same
time might be a consideration and that's
definitely something to keep in mind for
later on
all that said though apart from my two
graphics cards - Asus Strix GTX 1080p I
11 gig graphics cards what else is the
rest of the hardware that I'm working
with today because I actually have three
different test beds that I'm going to be
testing this out on as well as four
different CPUs so our first test bed
houses our Intel Core i7 7700 K which
most people will tell you is the best CT
for gaming right now when it comes to
pure gaming and I've wanted to again
give all the CPUs are really good to
chance at doing the best they can so I
have a water clean set up this is just a
ch 110 280 millimeter closed loop cooler
kept everything nice and chilly and I
originally had the CPU I'm able to get
the CP 24.9 gigahertz at least during
the winter months but since it is a few
degrees warmer here in the summer it was
giving me a little bit instability at
4.9 so I ended up dialing it back to 4.8
gigahertz on the CPU for memory I'm
running 8 gigabyte DIMMs pretty much and
everything so this is a 2 by 8 gigabyte
configuration Kingston HyperX predator
memory and I'm running all the memory at
3200 speed this one is running at Cass
latency 15 which is just ever so
slightly looser timings than the other
memory kits which are SEL 14 so that has
one slight difference between the
testbeds but as you'll probably see
coming up very soon didn't really impact
the benchmark numbers from what I could
sell for SSDs add all the systems on
nvme SSDs this one's on an Intel 600 P
series nvme SSD that has the operating
system on it and that pretty much rounds
things out except for the motherboard
which is the gigabyte or Z 270x gaming 7
and then the power supply is a Rozsival
1000 watt 80 + platinum rated unit for
our arrived and testbed we have this
setup right over here of course horizon
7 1800 X is the CPU eight cores running
at 4 gigahertz and being cooled by the
corsair h 100 ib2 both loops III floor
that's a 240 millimeter all in one units
the motherboard of course is the
old-school well I don't say old school
but the old standby the crosshair 6 here
that I've done a lot of testing with
rising with the memory is sort of tucked
away in there and also one that I've
done a decent amount of testing with
rather than the G scale flare X kit so
this made specifically to play nice with
rising higher frequencies again that is
a 2 by 8 gig kit and I'm running it at
3200 speed this one's a cast latency 14
for storage there's a Patriot Hellfire
for turn 80 gig nvme SSD please ignore
the graphics card that's currently on
there of course all the testing was done
with the two-way na vis
and finally just in case you're
wondering that is alien a PC t60 testbed
and the power supply is a coarser HX one
and I and finally over here on the
Praxis wet bench we have our final test
bed and this one's probably where most
of the focuses at least as far as what
the game performance is going to be this
is an X 299 test bed it is based on the
msi gaming m7 a ckx $2.99 motherboard
down there sort of holding everything
together
and also handling the overclock which is
doing a pretty good job with so far the
77 40 X that is currently installed
there it's been overclocked to five
point one gigahertz it's actually
running at about five point one zero to
five gigahertz to be more specific and
it's kept cool by the Fraxel Kelvin 360
that's actually the third 60 millimeter
version of their liquid cooler you can
only really see the pump part of it
right there with the tubing and
everything on it but there it is for the
memory kit again I have any gig dims
when it's in the 77 40 X configuration
it's just going to have to a kingdoms
that are currently lit up over here on
this side again running at 3200 speed
cast latency 14 and then when I pop in
the the 78 20x then it will give me
quad-channel and then I'll have 4 by 8
gig dims and they'll all light up which
which will sure be nice as for an SSD
this one is running on an OC z rd 400
and via me feather and 12 gig SSD
although it is completely covered up by
the graphics cards down there at the
bottom so you can't really see it right
now the test but it's sitting out of
course into practice what wet bench and
then for a power supply I have the
gigabyte extreme gaming 1200 watt 80 +
platinum rated given everything the
juice it needs to power to games and
then my final testing configuration
which is the same X 299 test bed but
this time instead of a 77 40 X I have
swapped into 78 20 X which is the 8 core
16 thread skylight X CPU the reason I
chose this one is because it seems to be
the most viable option for me to use in
my water-cooled system and basically I
might have tried the 6 core or of course
I got the 10 core as well but I'm trying
to find the best suitable candidate for
this purpose
and I wanted to say good overclock
decently and once you get up to the
higher forecast it becomes more
difficult to overclock but I was able to
overclock the 78 to 20x 24.6 gigahertz
which I think will give it a decent
amount of extra Headroom when it comes
to the gaming performance when compared
to something like the 70 240 X but I
still don't have high hopes because
typically with gaming frequency is still
king and so I'm guessing that these 77
40 X is going to still come out on top
let's get a my actual overclocking and
testing configuration though I've
already mentioned all the CPUs in the
test beds that I'm running on and
overclocks to the CPUs the graphics
cards I did overclock as well though
although not by much since these are
already pre overclocked asus strix
graphics cards basically set the power
limit this is msi afterburner
afterburner by the way so the parallel
matte 220 percent plus 45 on the core
clock plus 350 on the memory clock and I
set the fan speed on both GPUs to static
60% just to help kick all of that warm
air out just to reiterate all the memory
configurations I'm using with all the
test beds are olds running at 3200 speed
and then they're all cast latency 14
except for that hyper x kit which is
amazeen sony testbed that's a castle 8d
15 which hopefully shouldn't affect
things too much all the tests I'm
running as far as the benchmarks are
going to see today I chose specifically
because they actually scale decently or
pretty well when an SLI to GPU
configuration I was just figuring if I
chose games that didn't that wouldn't
make much sense since i'm testing sli so
that's why I show the games I did and if
you want to check out some of the
reviews that I researched prior to this
video I posted some links to those down
in the description below
all that said at long last here are all
of my benchmarks
okay guy all those tracks represents a
lot of work so I hope you have looked at
all of those numbers very carefully I
have certainly because I'm trying to
make a decision based on then so first
off we're going to look at those
synthetic benchmarks the 3dmark ones for
example they might initially seem to
indicate that one of the cpu platforms
is doing better than the others however
bear in mind that those synthetic
benchmarks tend to weigh in stuff like
raw CD performance a lot more they have
physics based tests that CPUs with
higher core temps tend to do very well
at so that's where you might see some of
that variance if you actually look at
the GPU scores on those tests you'll
notice there's only about a one to two
hundred point difference between each of
the four platforms using this same GPU
configuration now specifically comparing
the cabling CPUs the KB like X 7740 X
and the KB like 7700 K the KB like X had
about a 300 megahertz frequency
advantage since it was ringed at five
point one gigahertz versus 7700 K
running at four point eight gigahertz
now test could have been done over the
past month or two that I've been
surprised that have shown the 7,700 cake
beating 787 40s in a lot of situations
and that might actually get a case if
you're setting up a very CPU limited
circumstance such as testing games at
1080 that this both ways because testing
games of today is a very good way to put
the burden on the CPU and to get more
information about which CPUs are
performing better however when it comes
to
a real-world situation the chances of
somebody purchasing two 1080p is and
running them in SLI and then playing
games at 1080 is pretty slim or at least
you're not investing your money in the
most effective way you should get one
1080i and then spend other money on a
better monitors what you should probably
do so that's why do these tests in this
way it should be a little bit more
real-world and say for what I'm actually
going to be using these GPUs for what is
going to get the best performance and in
the end with that frequency advantage
these seventy seven forty X actually
seems to outperform the 7700 K at least
in these tests that I've tried today so
it does seem like it is viable in that
regard however I've only tested this
because I was thinking if there is going
to be some huge disproportionate change
with the 77 40 X that I might actually
consider using it but it's very minimal
and I don't think the sacrifices you
have to make with we going with cabling
X the additional cost gets spent on the
motherboard the lack of the ability to
use quad channel memory the lack of the
ability to access a lot of the stuff on
a high-end X tonight and I'm motherboard
just doesn't make it worth the cost now
it's for my 1,800 X system back here I
was actually quite impressed with its
performance we saw some pretty
significant debt deficits when testing
right and when it initially launched but
there have been a lot of updates when it
comes to Baro loves you Jesus updates as
well as memory compatibility as well as
a face to Windows and some of the games
that have been patched to improve
performance there as well however across
the board the 1,800 X systems still did
lag behind all the other Intel based
systems that I've tested today even if
it was minimal I would say that if I was
looking to early at a what's the best
price to performance option here I
pretty much sure that the rise in system
would win however since the cost is less
of a concern with this particular
demonstration and looking more towards
what is the best option I have to say
I'm probably not going to do a rise in
base build for the next version of
Arctic pancakes
7700 K did very well today and if I was
choosing it all around winter when it
comes to both the price and the
performance that's probably what I would
choose because you'd have to spend a lot
of money on the motherboard give really
good performance you can overclock as
long
you're not going to be screaming because
the 7700 K does have a performance
deficit when it comes to streaming
especially when you're comparing at your
rice and six score an eight-core options
but if all you want to do is play games
in the 7700 K is still where it's at but
the 78 20 X is actually CPU from all
this testing that I'm leaning towards
the most for a few different reasons
first off that overclock pretty easily
hit 4.6 gigahertz granted I couldn't go
much beyond that but that's about what I
was expecting when it comes to a core
CPU offerings from Intel right now
second if I am going to be using this in
a new liquid-cooled system build and I'm
comparing it to the previous version
which featured an 8 core 50 59 60 X as
well as quad channel memory is an
enthusiast platform system build it
would seem like a little bit of a
downgrade to switch to the mainstream
and to lose out on stuff like quad
channel memory and that kind of thing
I know I'm not speaking from the from a
practical standpoint or perspective I'm
speaking from the enthusiast perspective
where I just want things to be good and
fast and everything of course you can
critique you there because that is
really going for the enthusiast
perspective I would just put the 7900 X
in there and call it a day but the 7900
X does run very hot and even how do we
need attempt to overclock it since it is
a 10 chord so I'm thinking the 8 course
as sort of an in-between still seems
like an upgrade still gets most of the
gaming performance it's not that last
few percentage points that you might be
able to get with 7700 K or 77 40 X I'm
thinking that seems like possibly the
most reasonable reasonable can be a word
when describing the second build
solution but I of course I'm very
curious to hear what you guys think I
was like taking your feedback into
consideration so please leave me
comments in the comment section down
below let me know what you think of
these numbers that I have gathered over
the past few days and all of my
benchmark testing now I can't end this
video without at least quickly
mentioning thread Ripper because it's
only a couple weeks away from launch
according to what AMD has told us and
there's a ton of people are going to be
like ah just just waiting to build a
trigger for system first off I'm not
expecting gaming specific performance on
thread referred to be any better than it
is on Verizon it's using the same
architecture using the same CPU cores
it's
going to be viable we're going to be
good it's still probably going to be a
really excellent price to performance
option but I'm not expecting it to
suddenly leak Probie until chips to
provide better gaming performance also
this is theory I'm not going to build a
shredder for water-cooled system to them
we're all going to do that as well
it's just probably not going to be this
system that I'm planning to build right
now so stay tuned for that it will be
coming soon
I've got rising 3 coming up got credit
for hopefully soon after that and I've
course got this build that I'm not ready
to move on to the next step wait so
thank you guys so much for watching this
video that thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it of course I'll be back next
week with more excellent content as
always about the technologies and I
might even show my dog self again thanks
for watching guys then we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
