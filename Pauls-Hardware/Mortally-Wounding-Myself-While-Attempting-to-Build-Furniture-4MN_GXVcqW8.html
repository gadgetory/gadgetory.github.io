Pulsar it today is Saturday and I have a
lot of work to do and I'm gonna take you
guys along for the ride now the main
goal of this video is to build a stand
for that system right behind me that is
Riptide you guys may have seen some of
the videos I put together on that it's
all put together it's functional but
it's not where it needs to be which is
the computer room because I have nowhere
to put it in there and in the meantime
it is large and cumbersome and I've been
moving it back and forth between out
here in the dining room and the garage
and I just need a permanent spot for it
but I can't put it on the floor I have a
very hard and fast rule against doing
that so I'm gonna build a custom-made
stand for it which actually put together
some plans for yesterday there my plans
such as they are I probably spent too
much time on that but I should be able
to build the whole thing out of one big
piece of plywood and four two by fours
for the most part but before I get to
that I actually have to take care of
another issue which is that we just got
a new fridge it's a whirlpool and we're
very excited about it it's a big upgrade
over our old fridge but now I want to
connect up the water line to it we had
an old water line that we can't really
use anymore so I just went to ace
hardware and got some replacement pieces
so so to start this video and hopefully
to expedite the process of getting all
this cold food back into the
refrigerator so it doesn't go bad here
is how to set up a water line with a new
fridge if you
and please bear in mind I have no idea
what I'm doing fortunately these water
lines are pretty simple here's the old
water line it's just a tube it's got a
little cap right here a little plug that
keeps the fitting from going down over
the end this one has been sitting for
quite a while and it's pretty messy
which is why we are getting a new one
and then it would fit into something
like this this is just a little coupler
and this is actually from the existing
line and we were able to save it thanks
to Ace Hardware how the guy pulled this
off of there and said hey save you like
six bucks you know it to buy a new one
of those pretty simple procedure for the
new one though and if you've ever done
PC water cooling actually very similar
so there's a little fitting you'd fit
right in there and then the actual
fitting goes on over there I'm using the
same word for all these because I don't
know the actual proper terminology for
it this little plug goes on right over
that and then this will put pressure on
that down once it fits into there then
you just tighten it down like so and you
gotta make sure that that's plugged in
there all the way down here and erm I
think I have one saving grace for this
whole process and that is that the
actual cold water line which is right
here actually already has a fitting on
it so it's got a little splitter right
there for the cold water come off and
then there's just a cap on top so this
is already prepared if you don't have
this there is another kit you can do
that like should punch a hole in the
copper pipe back here and I don't have
to worry about that so I can just
hopefully close this off undo this and
then connect my water line up to that
yeah it's taking the nozzle down water
comes up if water does come out it will
be frantically running out to shut up my
mean I don't think that's gonna happen
hey that's good
and tube his feeding water and I don't
see any leaks the spy
and now turning the water back on you
some pressure now look that's all the
way open connection does not appear to
be leaking it's good water water for the
fridge
that oh hello very energy efficient
water
these have been out here a little bit
too long by themselves and this little
tent thing and I had a few residents
move in like this one right here I'm
just going through here and trying to
clear these guys out I'm sorry
these ladies are me ma'am she looks
rather pregnant yes that is black widow
by the way
pardon me sawhorse friend nope she's
gone back into hiding I got her
well guys I ran out of daylight
yesterday so it is Sunday now but I
didn't make a pretty decent amount of
progress on this little project so I
think I'm ready to hopefully finish it
off in the next hour - I've got the
frame set down here and this is gonna be
the long part that the computer itself
will sit on top of so that was intended
to be nice and sturdy and since I'm
using two by fours it is incredibly
sturdy and then there's just one other
piece of the frame that sits off there
this will be l-shaped going that way and
then over that way I did screw together
the end pieces but not this middle piece
yet because I'm planning to do a piece
of plywood for the top piece and then
also one down on the bottom and I need
to make sure it fits in down there so I
might assemble this one around it to
hold them in I'm just using number eight
screws I've got a two inch and a three
inch have been mostly using the three
inch but if there is like a knot down in
a lower one I was using the two inch
just so I can get in there and hold a
little bit so all its left is to take my
3/4 inch piece of birch plywood there
cut it to the proper shape and then
attach it and I'm just going to be
attaching it from the bottom to
hopefully hide my screws because these
two inch screws can come up just enough
to secure that plywood hopefully without
going all the way through
alright guys it is now Monday and here
just as far as I got over the weekend
everything is pretty much cut to size
and all the notches extend in the bottom
piece for the pieces that support
everything the center part here has
still not been cut out there's a fair
amount of twist in these two by fours I
did use them because I've had him in the
garage for a while so I didn't have to
wait for them to acclimatize or anything
that as I am screwing them in I'm sort
of twisting them back to try to make
everything as square as possible and
then of course everything's gonna bolt
to that from the bottom but before we
move on I gotta sand as much as possible
and I'm also gonna try to give a little
bit of a rounded edge to the very top of
it here guys are working my shift
final part yes I just can't
just an overkill for sawdust but
if I knew Paul was gonna make me a work
I would have brought different clothes
but no I warned you ahead of time
there you go
a little bit more that's way better
no chicken this any rounded corner here
is hard to get at with the router so
just suggested to wrap the sandpaper
around a big - but this is my second
choice what I can say is not stupid but
if it works
it's amazing how much nicer wood is when
it's got a nice sand on it and now for
any of you guys who actually do
woodworking who are watching this and
hopefully offering me critiques and
helpful suggestions in the comments I've
decided not to put a stain or finish on
this that's mainly due to time
restraints time considerations I want to
get this put together and set up today
but we are giving it a very nice sand we
got all the individual pieces sanded up
and of course we've got a nice little
kind of curved edge all along the
outside here so that's our top piece and
now I think it's time to put this all
together I sure you want some of this
Joe has shed blood for this project that
means that's a very good sign Joe
now your views can be age restricted cut
off blood I hope not it's just it can't
be shown in China now all right we're
moving on to the assembly process I need
to drill pilot holes from underneath
here in order to attach the top support
beams in case you draw your thumb again
yeah I'm gonna get it don't do that
yeah guys see don't do that you're
drilling the screw here yeah how your
Henley this is a clamp oh oh another
vein degrees of woodworking skill and
Aspen chip level my goal with this build
was to hide all the screws so like none
of the screws should be visible from the
top or the front for anything next
projects maybe I can work on stuff like
seams and joints and making those all
perfect and ideal
oh wow what it's a black widow open the
corner there let's be pretty big if you
can see it up there there's like four
sacks oh fuck oh kanay don't worry about
filming that Joe why it's cool
oh my god oh this amount I have no idea
you need to get some raid I was a spider
killer and going on like Kenny's free
right now each each one on the top of
this I had to unscrew it and take the
piece off because these are just ideal
homes for black widows so each one of
these had four or five egg sex in it as
well as one big fat to them that black
widows in two of them have brown bears
so see someone pause workmanship here we
need to fix it looks like a Nightmare
Before Christmas building here it's like
okay it's a little askew it's alright we
don't fix it no big deal so far so good
so here is the computer room and this is
where the new stand is going to be as
you can see my wife's computer hot box
my existing main editing rig which I'm
going to be swapping out Riptide for and
then of course the current sort of
makeshift stand at the bottom also of
course some cable management needs to be
done in here but for the time being
we're just going to clear the stuff and
put in the new piece of furniture that
has been made here
you can do a poem so you know he wants
to help by kidding in the way she smells
but cool beautiful yes nor you know he
likes it a lot
isn't it nice nori don't you like it
she's like beat me Pet me play with me
awesome
hero likes being right there here boy
good boy what do you want belly ribs
yeah that good yes you do
click boy okay so the Riptide massive
computer has been moved over placed on
the stand it is it is sturdy enough and
it's supporting it again there is maybe
some slight concerns about the center of
this thing just because the system is so
incredibly large and heavy but for the
time being it's holding it up it's
fitting in the corner as it should I
have hot box my wife's computer over
here I could actually rotate that 90
degrees and have it facing that way too
but I'm gonna hold off and let her
decide on what to do there my wife's
desk is a mess of cables because she has
a secondary work laptop that she has to
wire in there so she has like a VM set
up and everything she uses this 43 inch
4k monitor which is pretty nice to play
over watching stuff but I will of course
still need to get all that stuff set up
properly but for now that we have a
functional new piece of furniture that
I've built of course with much help from
Joe I was kind of a funny thing but as I
was assembling this project I realized
though yeah it was like two and a half
three months ago in the middle of summer
I started a project very similar to this
and I have a bunch of footage from that
that project was actually intended to
build a small ramp for nori so that she
can get up onto the couch and now
specifically because she gotten surgery
on one of her rear leg
so she went through some recovery time
and I spent a fair amount of time
putting that ramp together built its to
specific standards so that she could run
up it and everything
I even injured myself somewhat severely
by drilling through my thumb which led
to a lot of blood and consequently to me
kind of giving up on that project not
not giving up I still finished it made
the ramp and then I tried to get nori to
use it and she refused we got here to
use it a couple times but that's still
been completely a lost cause on that
ramp so maybe I'll come back to that in
the future and fix it so she'll actually
use it but for now that is all the time
I have for this video so guys thank you
for sticking with me I know this has
been kind of a not that great production
quality video since I've been just
shooting it kind of vlog style running
good but I'm happy to say that Riptide
is going to be actually integrated into
my workflow now hooray for actually
making use of they didn't say an
over-the-top PC build that I did in
there so I'll put a link to the entire
build log for that if you want to check
it out in this video's description and
thank you guys so much for watching this
video hit the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it I got more videos coming out
later this week so stick around for
those too subscribe if you're not
already thanks again for watching guys
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
