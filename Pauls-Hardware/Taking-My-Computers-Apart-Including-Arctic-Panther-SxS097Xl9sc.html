sponsor link in the description to learn
more what's up guys welcome back to
Pauls hardware next to me here I have
Riptide my epic $10,000 plus custom PC
actually two pcs in one in the Corsair
1000 d case and I'm excited for phase 2
of this build in fact alpha cool has
confirmed that parts are on their way
like as of today to outfit this with a
custom articling loop however before I
get into all that I really need to take
a look at arctic panther right here
behind me my original og custom
water-cooled build it has been eight
months since I did the final video in
this build series and it is high time
for arctic panther to get a flush of
liquid as well as maybe just look in
there to make sure everything is working
just fine I know it's working good
because I just did a live stream with
this system on Sunday but maintenance is
important for liquid cooled systems so
that's what we're going to be tackling
today but before we even get to that I
need a little bit more space to work
with the past month has been pretty
chaotic with travel and everything and
I've also built several systems and
since I can't continue to use these
systems as is I need to disassemble them
so that's what we're gonna do right now
let's see how fast I can get this done
taking those computers apart took a
little bit longer than expected one
thing I did notice about arctic Panther
back here somehow we have rehabilitated
our flow indicator yes
Remo chill flow indicator is now flowing
so I guess when I did the live stream on
Sunday and kept it warm for an extended
period of time maybe that loosened that
up it is time to shut this down though
and move on to the maintenance portion
of today's video off comes our og
tempered glass side panel rockin
tempered glass on a define r5 before it
was cool and now what are things looking
like inside o others maybe there's maybe
some stuff to be concerned about here so
it does seem like I have plenty of flow
in here still as indicated by the
previously moving flow indicator
although there is some buildup so if you
guys are call.when pretty much he'll
launch the view fluid which is very
pretty looking it's opaque fluid with
some texture stuff in there to make it
actually noticeable as the fluid is
flowing through it and various people
like myself and J and others who have
tried it have had varying experiences I
should point out that what I got was one
of the earliest original batches of the
white fluid so they have made some
updates and some changes to it since
then and they've also come out with like
a system prep kits which is like a
biocide some cleaning stuff that you add
to your existing loop to make sure that
you're cleaning out any old parts that
might have old dye or something like
that in it now from the original
original arctic panther builds from like
four years ago I did have some old
opaque white fluid that was still
possibly kept in some of the parts so up
here specifically in the model block is
where I'm seeing the most amount of
buildup and it's mostly white stuff in
there so obviously not good we don't
want too much of that in there but again
I can't be totally sure if this is
residue from the og opaque white fluid
that I had in the og arctic Panther
build or the newer view fluid that I had
since then but whatever the case may be
I'm going to drain this
Loup today and we'll see if just cycling
through some fluid can help clean some
of that gunk out so file this under your
best laid plans can all go awry I have a
fair amount of flexible tubing I got
some replacement from from primo chill
here there remember flex advanced what
I've discovered though is that while I
do have lots of fittings they're all
hard line fittings I have been I've done
like all hard line water cool builds so
far so my plan of setting up a little
loop off of this thing to cycle stuff is
really going by the wayside and I don't
want to do any tube bending to set that
up so I'm pretty much stuck with this as
far as my drain goes I do have a funnel
for the top so I can refill stuff but I
think based on the buildup of residue
inside this is gonna need a scrub out
anyway so this is gonna be a two-part
video gonna disassemble Arctic fans are
completely an attempt to do a complete
restoration of the water cooling loop I
was missing this key piece which is a
little reducer for G 1/4 2g
three-eighths don't worry this is
perfectly safe
and then all I should have to do is turn
that
like you can still see some of the view
stuff in there
a tiny little bathroom spider spider
must have crawled through here at some
point
it was proud panther talk abouts
oh she's supposed to show that everyone
needs a little TLC from time to time
nice to see this kind of thing this
shows me that the the flush would not
have done much for us because I'm
running water directly over that caked
on residue and it is not it's not going
away
it needs active active scrubbing
it's probably that as clean as I'm gonna
get it it's also a bit of cloudiness in
there that I don't think is just fog
I think that's cloudiness residue so
this might need some actual cleaner to
go through there there rather than just
a rinse and which means I probably need
some cleaner and I'm not exactly sure
what I should use for this I could just
read Bend all my tubes but I don't want
to do that yeah so here's our primo
chill flow indicator so I'm not entirely
sure why this stopped up meanwhile
inside ooh some nastiness
so centerpiece here can actually be
removed the Curt the build-up the
residue actually got in between there
and then built up against the bearing
itself and that's what caused this to
get gummed up stop spinning alright guys
as predicted this is going to be a
two-part video because I ended up
disassembling this whole thing in fact
this whole video has pretty much been
about me taking all my computers apart
so I guess that's what I'll call this
video but I hope you've enjoyed it and I
have hopefully learned some stuff in
this process as well now the blocks are
the main reason why I need to make this
a two-part thing as you can see they
have filled up with some gooey gooey
residue buildup in there and that is a
result of the pretty coolants that I use
which is opaque but which also leads to
build up over time and remember it's not
just the view stuff that I used in here
for the arctic panther rebuild but I
also had some white opaque coolants that
I had for the original arctic panther
build and I did reuse at least a
radiator from that build so chemically
the makeup that I had going on in this
loop was not ideal and that has been
proven by the build up that you can see
I did try to clean out some of the tubes
to get that residue out and there was um
some cloudiness still so I think I'm
gonna need to actually attack this with
some actual cleaning agents but I'm not
a hundred percent sure what I'm gonna
use for that yet so if you guys have any
suggestions for me leave them in the
comments I might go with that or I'm
probably gonna actually check with Jay
to and see if he has any suggestions for
me but to close out this video have I
learned anything well yes one is that if
you're going to use an opaque coolants
or anything that's pretty you should
probably flush your loop fairly often
especially with the opaque stuff it's
just
really a good idea to leave it in there
long-term so if you're building a show
build it's okay but if you're looking
for something that you're gonna use I
would recommend just going with clean
distilled water perhaps with a little
bit of biocide in it and that's
definitely what I'm going to be using
for Riptide once I move on with that
build a second thing would be my drain
system here I do like that I have the
fill port at the top and the drain at
the bottom and actually most of this
loop did drain just fine but I think
because of some of the radiator setups
as well as some was the aesthetic
trickiness I had going on up here with
the flow indicator and some of those
Lukie loop bends made it so that it
didn't actually all flush out so I did
have to sort of take it apart a piece at
a time and there still was a decent
amount of fluid up in those radiators so
again with the Riptide build my plan is
to go with quick disconnects so that if
I do need to flush the system I can take
it off a piece at a time like I can take
the block off as one complete thing or I
can take the GPUs off as one complete
thing and then flush those individually
but that's all the time I have for this
video guys so of course leave me
comments in the comment section below I
imagine you guys have some feedback like
how silly it is for me to have built
this high end of a system and then do
what I did to it with the opaque coolant
maybe some commentary on my overripe
bananas I don't know just just let me
know anything you have to say thumbs up
button too of course if you enjoyed it
and subscribe to my channel if you want
to see more videos as well as the rift I
built as well as the follow-up to Arctic
Panther rehabilitation again thanks
again for watching guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
