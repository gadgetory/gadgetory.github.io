right great plan yeah okay good cuz I'm
not ready for mine so I'll be preparing
slightly for mine as you the worry about
as you ramble on about don't worry about
it complete nonsense don't even worry
about it
I'm worried okay um we should now be
live to YouTube so hello YouTube and
tell us which and tell us anyone who is
watching our live show hi everyone it's
awesome hardware we usually do it every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time and we're back on track this week
this is episode number 107 and we've had
sort of a the past month has been a bit
erratic with our live-streaming schedule
so sorry about that
for those of you who maybe tried to show
up and we weren't live when we were
supposed to be but we're back now from
copy Tech's things should be back to
normal and back on schedule for the for
the coming weeks we don't have any other
plans to miss anything so thanks for
sticking with us
speaking of which we're back from
Computex Cal and I have both been
traveling too far wheel and East Asia
where the time is the future and we have
now traveled back and therefore we are
both jet-lagged we happen to do the show
right at the point of the day when
jetlag isn't is sucking the worst so I
this could all be a dream yeah I am very
I think it's going well though I'm very
I'm happy because when I wake up and we
actually do the live show I think things
are gonna go great because this dream is
just swimmingly it's been swimmingly she
was more like a nightmare well that's
cuz you're not prepared cab no it's
because we haven't drank the beer um you
should be prepared we can turn it into a
nice dream yes we're still gonna drink
some beer as we usually do and we're
still going to at least attempt to go
over some of the tech news that's been
happening because there's fair amount to
discuss so thanks for being here and
cheers Cheers
changings Cheers the big ass joke yeah
and this is a courtesy of one of our
fans you know who you are thank you sir
not gonna say your name on stream
because I forgot it
sorry mister they I forget the name I
read the letter and everything and I
like I said his name you can find it
like in the stream that we open this in
latakia might have to go back and look
at the bank yet verified that's why I
say in the declaration does exist it's a
guy who's from Fargo ND new new Denmark
that's what that is right it happens
what's that that was Marilyn not Marilyn
Marilyn Marilyn Marilyn yes that's what
I'm be used oh this is gonna be a good
show I can feel it
it also welcome to frantic addition it
also might be slightly shorter show than
usual but it also might be a bit of a
 show yep noisy I would alright
bring it up a code bring up the asset a
source code for everything's good
egregious alright alright if you're not
impressed already help support us by
buying stuff at our stores here's my
store pulse up right at that F sure it's
in mugs and pint glasses they're all
very high quality and if you buy during
the show we'll give you a shout out at
the end of the show
assuming we remember today I think we
will we're pretty up with that here Kyle
store is bit with tech slash store he
also has various paraphernalia in the
accouterments category accouterments
yakoo term it's that sounds funny
accouterments you said cooter right so
for my half of the show basically I got
a big block of news some tech news and
then we're gonna do some QA that's all
thanks ounds great that is so let's just
I've loved it straight into it has
anyone been trying to purchase a beer a
glass of beer I mean could I buy a glass
of beer oh yeah for me yeah I was
thinking about it from the folks over at
Newton partnership finishes yes so this
is again from North Dakota Fargo North
Dakota
is the Fargo Brewing Company established
in 2010 and I believe this is the pale
ale that he sent over no this was I
think the blonde blonde the pale ale got
lost in the mail
yeah one of them wood was destroyed it
was completely leaked that's why his
letter was blurry and he really read it
thank out your finger is probably a much
happier way to open this than then wire
cutters but wire cutters it was the
nearest tour
and so it's an active degree okay so
while cowboys us out some of that let's
discuss the relative scarce scarcity
right now for anyone who's trying to buy
a Radeon graphics card not particularly
a Polaris based Radeon graphics card
they're just hard to find it's sold out
everywhere and where you can find them
in stock they're grossly overpriced way
to pull a Polaris card yeah what at 570s
Radeon rx5 70s and 5 80s they're hard to
find
yes really yes that's what I just said
wait say it one more time so I can make
very difficult to find what's good knew
it when I didn't hear about this now
Kyle why why aren't you familiar with
this with this this proceeding because
I've been busy covering technology in
different country that I forgot about
the rest of the kind of technology that
was announced elsewhere man doing site
is just alright here's here's our x5 70s
at new egg cheers Cheers I hope this
hasn't gone bad
again you don't think it would right
bigger doesn't go bad it's in the
growler all can go stale well it can ooh
that's very refreshing yeah it's very
like crisp and light it's very light but
not like a Bud Light light yeah it's
like a good light okay good found that
all day are go light all right back to
the matter at hand look at all these
missing rx5 70s see they're just uh no
no no by Wow even all of these combos
are also on other no defiance what
you're saying is we should take this
opportunity to sell our current 570s
that we own for a ridiculously high
price yeah if you got anything any of
those hanging around got toss them up on
eBay because right now the
cryptocurrency miners apparently are
gobbling them up a resurgence and
cryptocurrency mining is what is causing
this for any of you guys who were just
who just want to build the damn gaming
PC and was like I'm going to get a 580
and now they're all gone this same sort
of thing happened towards the end of
2013 if you guys were around at that
time lots of AMD graphics cards snapped
up by bitcoin and litecoin miners at
that time causing a similar shortage as
well as a price spikes where they were
available particularly in reseller sites
like eBay that kind of faded out because
Asics became more available and Asics is
an application-specific integrated
circuit so those were basically chips
that were designed specifically for
Bitcoin mining and litecoin mining
whereas with when you're when you're
mining on a GPU you're using
gpgpu general-purpose GPU software which
is not as efficient as a chip that's
designed specifically for it
so Asics became a thing the the amount
of power required for GPU mining sort of
started to die out and we this didn't
happen but there's been a resurgence in
newer hashing algorithms like etherium
dagger Hashimoto or Z caches equi hash
that has made GPU mining profitable once
again there's also been recent jumps in
etherium and Bitcoin at prices that have
also increased the validity of this kind
of thing twenty-five hundred and 25 USD
two thousand over two thousand five
hundred dollars u.s. is the average
price of a Bitcoin across all exchanges
right now Wow um and then I was talking
in Taipei a little bit with Wendell
about this and he said etherium mining
is is taken up too and the theory of
mining has I don't know he explained
things to me which I intended to absorb
and recount to you guys but now they
gone
because jet lag because jet lag just
blame jet like they're everything thanks
anyway the point is that these are bio
these they're viable means of mining
once again in particularly in
particularly if you live somewhere where
you not to pay a lot for electricity
like us here in Southern California like
yeah yeah sure I'm going to set up a
mining rig no nope like electricity
costs much money here we don't live like
conveniently close to a bunch of
hydroelectric power that kind of thing
and even those of us who use so even
those of us who have solar setup it's
not as much of a viable solution for
this type of thing so you kind of have
to have that combination of like you got
to be able to have cheap electricity
access to the cards and then maybe you
can mind some of this stuff I've heard
depending on the rig you set up you know
a modest configuration can net you you
know 100 bucks a week or something like
that yeah but obviously that varies
based on a lot of different variables
see I'm just I'm just curious do you
notice like your electric electricity
bill is like significantly higher to
when like we're reviewing new AMD or
Nvidia graphics cards oh yes doing my
tons of benchmarking if I have to I mean
ask times that and income if I combine
that with like see with doing this
summer when it's summer cuz their
electricity cost more in the summer here
when people when people are more likely
to be using it true yeah and like when
the 1080 has launched last year yeah
like right after Computex yep I was
running a bunch of benchmarks and like
it was it was very expensive my grandpa
like literally like came into my room
he's like can you pay the electricity
bill this month because it was just like
double the price and he knew it was
because of me guess he like basically
late lives in the dark I get regular he
met Eric letters from Southern
California Edison now with little graphs
that says here's like what a what a like
a responsible electricity using here's
the average for your neighborhood here's
you you can use you you suck you thank
you asshole you just like and like a
benchmark but most people probably
village don't work from home all the
time
on yeah pewter is juries electricity
right yeah I'm gonna get some good how
are you I gotta get some solar setup
that would be nice
honestly for considering that I work at
home and what I do I use relatively not
that much yeah but it's all relative
okay there are some concerns of course
about these developments with the AMD
cards becoming scarce and hard to find
the fear is that the cryptocurrency
miners aren't really gamers and these
are gaming graphics cards matric aming
so long term people might say this could
potentially hurt AMD's position in the
gaming world especially if you have less
adoption of their graphics cards right
now when people would might be hunting
for them you know when when that is kind
of the I mean that's really where they
selling them right now isn't with the
five es in the 570s they don't
have much in the higher end so it does
kind of suck that that makes it
difficult for people what I actually use
them for game gave me to find them a
quote from the article says etherium has
been the main reason for increasing AMD
graphics card prices but Z cash and
libery lb are why could do the same to
nvidia gtx 1060 can do about 21 mega
hashes per second and aetherium compared
to 26 mega hash per second on a 570 but
it also uses less power and currently
cost less so you know those are the
economic decisions that the coin miners
are making which results in you guys not
having graphics cards to buy yay Bitcoin
mining alright sweet so what might be a
solution to this in a conveniently
related story that we will now
gracefully segue into maybe a graphics
line glad you made for facto currency
mining yes yes here's an article on
video cards about that very thing
Wow pardon me this video cards dock
video cards dot-com so rumor rumor rumor
but the rumor is that AMD Nvidia might
be toying with the idea of actually
releasing graphics cards specifically
for Bitcoin mining or cryptocurrency
mining there's not a whole lot of
information on the article here but
suffice it to say that NVIDIA has
potentially a GTX 1060 with the JP 106
100 GPU it would be a custom Edition
made just for cryptocurrency money it
would lack display connections so it
would be an add-on card kind of like
what a Tesla would be and in the
workstation environments probably would
not support gaming at all you'd only
have a 90 day warranty it would be
cheaper than the models they make for
gamers probably because they don't have
to do things like pay licensing the HDMI
for the video out and they would be sold
by adding board partners so who knows
how viable this will be again like the
Asics are developed for the various
crypto cryptocurrency variants that are
out there you know GPU can compute
options might be less less of an option
this but hey anything that I think keeps
cards and stock for people actually want
to buy them for game this would be a
good thing and the article also says
that AMD is planning a Polaris based
model kind of in the same vein but
there's no details yet on that because
they could lower the the TDP on them
somehow even further or just make more
power efficient in general so that it's
not quite as expensive our good buddy
Anthony from tweak town just commented
in a YouTube chat Anthony he turned it
on his bit coining set up yesterday
eleven GPUs and it's currently sitting
at an estimated average of nine hundred
dollars per month well although I don't
know if that's nine hundred us sir our
Aussie are those Aussie bucks we're
talking yeah how much does he has to pay
for his electricity what's nine hundred
awesome bajillion although see he has
the advantage he is the advantage right
now because it's winter down there I
type in Aussie bucks to use me and
Google still knew exactly what I was
talking about a little Google a 901 one
Australian dollar is seventy five
percent of US dollar so even at nine
hundred Aussie bucks he's still paying
675 us alright and that's what that
eleven card rigged but we don't know
what cars he's using no maybe he can
write an article on tweak ten about that
yes happy ed free just just for the help
well anyway hi Anthony oh wait we did
did you see Anthony yeah yeah you end up
with him at the brass monkey party as
they hosted over you yeah you I was had
to drink your drinks for you I didn't
get it no I was like you're being
responsible work doing stuff that I
should have been probably making sure it
had videos didn't work there for that
you know I did side it's Anthony briefs
they start anybody didn't get saved by
Anthony but it was good to see you at
Computex and he did say it wasn't that's
nine hundred us he's talking so that's o
US dollars pretty penny very large penny
American Dad again if you're in
Australia you know in its winter use
that to heat your home at the same time
everybody wins
winter is coming okay let's move over to
the big news our continuation to the big
news so a lot of you guys are probably
at least somewhat familiar with this if
you have been following either of our
channels for the past week or just the
tech world in general because there's
been lots of discussion about this Intel
skylake
X new series of CPUs a new high-end
desktop platform X 299 chipset and a
stack of nine CPUs ranging from four
cores all the way up to 18 cores so yeah
course City not going to like dwell too
much on these details because we do have
some additional discussion plan on
Kyle's half of this show so we're going
to try to stick to kind of the the facts
base stuff here but with with just a
brief bit of commentary sure and then
we'll continue that in Cowes half
because like it's all the rage thing
right now to make a video video about
how Chris likes everyday like X and you
are about this extra now I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna toot my own horn or
anything and point out that I had one of
the original videos about this where I
raised some questions but I mean I
wasn't coming up
let me get Linus jumping in everybody
else and eventually you know eventually
everyone copies me I guess what I'm
thinking
okay no actually I did enjoy minuses
video I'm sure a lot of Yahoo's nice
have seen that it's are it's already
almost the two million views and in my
mind Linus is dropping his video about
that kind of has like its it took what
was sort of starting to build and kind
of just it really increased the catapult
today yeah the surge of of sort of anti
what the hell is Intel doing right with
this launch thing going on right now but
point being there's a bunch of CPUs
there's two KBTX CPUs a four core four
thread and a fork or eight thread those
at the very bottom of the stack those
only have 16 PCI Express lanes they are
going to slot into LGA
sixty-six socket motherboards just like
the much more higher core count ones as
well
there's rumors already the like those
CPUs that are under there for the KB
Lake X are really really just KB lake
like 7700 cores that the DES Linus said
they stapled it to the x16 and put it on
the 2066 substrate having only 16 lanes
available for something like an x - 9 -
9 board means that there is going to be
a really like right now if you buy next
ninety nine board and you look in the
you open up the booklet for it it'll
usually have two sets of configurations
for twenty eight lane CPU and a 40 lane
CPU which are the two options depending
if you get the entry level x99 as their
broad willy or the higher-end one now
there's going to be 16 lanes 28 lanes
for 444 lanes
yeah and just a huge amount of things
that might be on the board that may or
may not work so motherboard
manufacturers in a very confusing
situation where they have to either
design a board kind of geared more
towards the low end with fewer things
but then like dropping in a higher end
chip doesn't make as much sense in there
right or geared towards well taking
advantage of all the PCI lanes that are
available in a high-end desktop platform
but then if you drop in one of those
cabling X CPUs onto it you probably have
a bunch of stuff that's that turns off
so they said there's more stuff about it
as well again to continue to discuss so
we'll leave more of that forecast out of
the show but um some more specs stuff at
least that can be derived from this an
antique article about it and something
that's sort of been realized by a lot of
the press as a as we've gone to Computex
because there have been a skylight hex
CPUs that have been that have been going
around there's a bunch of X - 9 X 9 and
9 systems that have been on display but
all of those systems have been using
only up to the 10 core CPU that's that's
available right now so it seems like
those CPUs are a little bit more ready
it also seems like the really high core
count
use their distinguished by LCCC low core
count and those are the six to twelve
core variants then this high core count
HCC was the 14 to 18 core variants but
it seems like the first four the six
core eight core ten core and twelve core
are what's actually going to be
available when this launches in the
coming weeks there is some NDA steps
that we can't discuss about that as well
but in the coming weeks I think is fair
enough to say so the i7 7800 X is the
six core 7820 X is the eight core the
7900 X is the ten core and the I 979 xx
x is the twelve core the 7820 x is going
to be the eight core 600 dog processor
this is what a lot of people are calling
probably kind of that sweet spot of
getting the most bang for your buck out
of it that's the highest low core counts
variants with the base clock of 3.6
gigahertz and a 4.3 gigahertz turbo as
well as a 4.5 gigahertz turbo boost max
3.0 which will take the two fastest cars
on the chip and automatically overclock
them so up to four point five gigahertz
on two cores and then 4.3 when it's
fewer course we don't know exactly
because these have been tested and
that's not laid out in the specs get
supports for ddr4 2666 speed memory
which is nice and the big disappointment
for the eight core is it only as 28 PCIe
lanes which 8 cores CPUs back to the 59
60 X I've had 40 at least so that was a
big disappointment is that Intel decided
to really hamstring the amount of
peripherals that you can connect up to
that 8 core CPU by putting ass $400
premium between the $600 8 core and
$1,000 10 core and $1000 10 core is what
you got to do in order to get your full
complement of 44 PCIe links so Intel
continuing to play their game that
they've been playing as far as
segmentation of the CPUs and making you
pay more money for you know the most
functionality that you want um and we'll
have to see how that plays out once the
summer continues and we have the launch
not just of this platform from Intel but
also AMD stripper platform which is also
theoretically coming and thread Ripper
is what a lot of people have assumed is
the reason why in sell is even doing 12
or 14 core or 16 core I'm sorry
fourteen sixteen eighteen core I should
say CPUs on this platform because it
really seems like those weren't part of
the plan until Andy came out about a
week before Computex
and announced it week week and a half
and then in sub was like oh like our
halo products can no longer be that 12
core CPU be exactly because it's going
to get up shown by AMD saying well we
got a 16 core and when's the last time
Intel announced such a huge like CPU to
four stack and you know at copy Tex no
less and really didn't is not going to
have it ready until late that same year
or maybe even early next year like the
fact that we're not going to be seeing
you know the 14 through 18 core CPUs
till end of 2017 but Intel has just
announced it right now it seems like to
say the least premature and and very
reactive well I don't be meditated and I
certainly found it a bit disingenuous
because they did talk to the press a
good about a week before Computex
and we were provided a decent amount of
information that's what my original
video was based on it was not indicated
to us at all that those high at those
top three CPUs we're going to be
available and at the same time as the
rest in the stack right that's only come
out a little bit later this week as
people have gone to Computex and got a
little bit more information about these
things it's because until doesn't really
even know the information about these
things it's making it up as they go
seems to be potentially the case and I
think and and it makes perfect sense
when you've been in the lead for 10 plus
years you know a full decade more or
less in the desktop CPU market and then
all of a sudden you know the only other
challenger in the game steps it up a lot
and
and and basically you know starts to
take like the title I mean it's a
numbers game type of thing like we see
this with every industry or every market
really remember like when monitors came
out like having the highest refresh rate
was like a huge thing well we're doing
we're doing 75 we're do 100 we're doing
144 we're doing 200 plus or whatever you
know it just keeps going it's the same
thing here it's its core count now and
that's why I feel Intel his rush to this
you know hyper 12 core launch is because
AMD came out with you know they
announced thread Ripper and stuff and so
obviously it's a it's just doesn't
necessarily mean that more cores is
better in every sense of the word but I
think just from a marketing standpoint
and the way that the corporations see it
is like we need to be the best we need
to have the the highest of everything we
need to be the title holder for
something as trivial as core count I
mean when it comes down to it the
architecture has a lot more to do with
it as we've seen in the past but I think
just from a corporate sort of standpoint
Intel feels threatened which is good in
a way it's about time they feel
threatened it's been like I said a
long-ass time before there's been some
real competition in the high-end desktop
market for CPUs so you can you can
definitely you can definitely sense
Intel sweating right now but I think
that they're handling it poorly as
opposed to like like what Linus was
saying in his video like just make the
best thing you can now and sell it for
as cheap as you can and that will ensure
that you know you're staying afloat
against the competition but it seems
like Intel sort of jumped the gun here
and obviously we'll talk a bit more
about that on my half of the show but
indeed we with a lot to talk about yes
and I think I think there's I feel like
this it's still in the gestation period
to like the information is just coming
out there's no official reviews although
we will talk about some leaked
performance numbers on Kyle's half as
well legit here's here's here's some
early stuff that came out of Computex
this is a group of 3d article it came
out and this is just referring to some
of the discussions that have been going
on at computer
some of the partners at Intel works with
which mainly means motherboard
manufacturers and just a little bit of
information that's trickled out for
instance the article quotes again a
anonymous vendor is saying that none of
the partners I currently have their
hands on or have you even seen the 12
core 14 core 16 core or 18 core parts
that Intel has been talking about so
those don't seem to exist or I mean they
don't seem to be ready or at least have
any samples going out for validation or
testing anything like that the they did
do some early overclocking that some
early overclocking numbers of stuff like
the 7900 X and they're basically saying
that they're hitting about four point
two to four point three gigahertz
overclocking which is about the same
frequencies of bread while he was
heading for the high core count like the
69 50 X it depends on the ASIC quality
of course but the 4.5 gigahertz turbo
that you see on the specs again is
primarily going to be the two cores for
turbo boost max 3.0 but again this
article reiterates the fact that it
doesn't seem like those higher-end core
counts CPUs are going to be available
when this launches so yeah that it's
it's rough it's it's like Intel
attacking them on you can look as good
or bad until attacking them on as a
paper launch just to like throw shade up
because AMD theoretically has the thread
Ripper coming seems a little bit more
like a desperation move or just
something where they're like oh crap we
have to do something so yeah but let's
talk about one of the other probably
slightly less well-known continuing kind
of disappointment things well again
again a mixed bag like some cool things
but also some disappointments which is
the raid configurations that are going
to be available on this new platform and
here's the article from PC world by
Gordon ma um I have a funny story about
Gordon long after you okay fun
interaction I had with him excellent
context he's yeah I saw him there too
briefly yeah
all right so issues are shown off this
raid card heared we
what do they call it the hyper M 2 by 16
card which allows you to add 4 m dot to
nvme drives on a single PCIe card and
that allows you to basically shove a
bunch of extra m dot to nvme devices
onto your X to 99 configuration they
said that they could combine up to 20
devices in raid using a new system
called VR OC virtual raid on CPU and I
believe me rock me Rock Yankee that
sounds like a cool like a cool name Mira
it's like a Grand Theft Auto there you
go umm now from my understanding the X
to 99 chipset will allow you to connect
up to 3 m dot 2 nvme devices that you
can control via Intel Rapid Storage
Technology which is the pre boot rate
environment that you can set up by
turning raid on for your ear controller
and I believe that is separate from this
I think that is still a thing that you
can have up to 1 2 or 3 raid devices and
that's probably compatible with the
different raid configurations that rapid
storage technology has already been able
to do which is typically raid 0 raid 1
and raid 5 R and it seems like an add-on
technology right this is different this
is virtual raid on CPU so it's using the
CPU to catch as the to do the heavy
lifting for the raid configuration but
it is bootable which is something that a
software raid that you might have been
able to configure before is not so
that's one of the cool things also the
expandability expandability up to 20
devices altogether is pretty cool too
and again they have this demo mode right
there with that Asus raid card and they
had what they had eight devices they
were using eight until 600 P SSDs which
are okay they're decent why would they
use into nvme SSDs Paul is Intel they
use much faster competitor drives like
the samsung 960 pros for example that's
a good just makes much more sense if you
were trying to boast impressive numbers
the great question god I'm so confused
right now about this demo what have you
maybe
shed some light up about that because
this otherwise pretty cool raid solution
from Intel is restricted by several
things one is that it only works with
Intel nvme SSDs Oh which is pretty lame
yeah pretty lame I mean feet that's why
they yes why they're using 600 PS as
these here they're obviously much faster
SSDs available to say nothing of the
Intel 750 but a samsung 960 Pro like
you've already mentioned so that sucks
the configuration that they had running
here was hitting about 12 gigabytes per
second reads at least I think it was
doing more like 4 to 5 gigabytes per
second writes
Intel says in theory with 20 devices it
can hit 128 gigabytes per second which
is pretty which is pretty nuts
but again these stupid caches that they
put in there requires Intel Intel drives
to use raid it only works with skylake X
so will not work with KB like X and it
only works with raid 0 out of the box
here are their numbers this is the best
here are their results if you want to
take a look I am I ammeter as well it's
crystal this mark so but ok again about
4.5 gigabytes per second on the writes
and this this stupid freaking thing
right here what said this is an they've
gone the way of Apple it's so true yeah
so it's so true they see those chats
both chats are the same thing at the
same time this is your dongle I put USB
actually don't think it's a USB dongle
yeah it's a business it really 2000s it
plugs onto the board you have to buy it
separately in order to enable higher end
raid functions so again raid 0 you get
out of the box at rumored rumored that
it will be $99 for the dongle that you
plug in that will that will enable raid
1 and $299 for the one that will enable
raid 5 now the the reason why Intel is
doing this and this is my opinion but
I'm pretty confident in this we
No is because this platform high-end
desktop is starting to overlap with a
lot of the capabilities of their servers
I setup yeah
and server-side stuff is very expensive
and they like it to be very expensive
because large companies buy it and they
can make very good profit margins that
way they're worried that allowing the X
299 the new high-end desktop platform to
do this stuff just out of the box
without some added cost will make savvy
IT people who want to save a small
business some money be like oh well I
don't we don't need to go with that dual
xeon platform i can just get you this on
x 299 set up some raid you'll basically
have all the functionality with that
that you have a Z on with for you know
less money of course and that's less
money you don't want to compete with
himself sure but I think just from like
a marketing standpoint and maybe like an
ethical standpoint wouldn't it have been
better and like given Intel less heat or
attracted less negative attention had
they just disabled that all together
like have they not just had they not
even offered the paid dog like because
having like raid keys and stuff I mean I
just feel like that's a that's an
immediate cash grab type of thing it's
like Intel should have just left it out
entirely instead of because the fact
that they've turned it into a dongle
means that they could have easily just
built it into the board but they have
created a separate piece of hardware for
it just to get more money and to not
compete with themselves obviously but I
just feel like it's it's attractive
attracted more negative attention than
it is going to actually profit them
alone and I mean the physical the
physical bit of hardware is a lot more
difficult to to spoof it was if it was
purely a software solution and they were
trying to protect this and lock it out
having that having the hardware
requirement it's the same reason why
like really really expensive
five thousand ten thousand dollar
software suites have a hardware key that
was required to be plugged in but I mean
beyond that it's really it's it's the
same reason why consumers are going to
be upset that the eight core Intel CPU
only has 28 PCIe lanes it feels like a
step back and something that's been
taken away that was there
or it's been pretty standard right now
for Intel's
SATA controllers at least the one that's
part of their chipset that can control
usually the six devices to have raid
zero one five zero one and five support
and it's going to be very very it's
going to make a lot of sense for a lot
of people who wants to actually invest
in getting you know four or more nvme
SSDs that they are going to want
something like raid five and it sucks to
have to spend three hundred bucks on
that on a platform where before it's
felt like that thing has come along for
free true now again I feel like there is
some potential counter to this I mean if
you do want to stick up for Intel to
some degree because like I said the
information they told us about Eckstein
and X 299 says that you can have up to
three nvme devices connected with Intel
Rapid Storage Technology and that if it
works same way as it does before can
create a bootable raid array it is
Hardware controlled it is pre OS so that
can be a viable alternative for this and
until it could be saying well look this
is a configuration that is higher ends
most people aren't going to be doing
more than three m dot two nvme SSDs and
you can do the stuff you could before
with that so again since some of the
stuff is still pretty early and since
the embargo hasn't lifted for full
reviews on any of this hardware or
anything
a lot of that still remains to be seen
but again just one of those things and
some decisions that Intel has made with
this launch and with this platform that
seems a little bit I don't know could be
better
in a lot of ways right so yeah again
we'll continue to discuss this on Kyle's
have the show let's move on to a couple
other things this was a random thing
that I saw EVGA posts and it came up
because Kyle and I have been involved in
scrapyard wars and if you guys watching
that on Linus tech tips channel it's the
episode three of four has now been
launched and floatplane Club viewers
have not seen the final one that's funny
you mentioned I was literally just
responding to someone who was talking
about scrapyard wars fme GA was after
the story that you're about to now which
it yes which I immediately saw in the
comm
for this so yeah I think this might be
over cuz I think it's already it's
already done or it's not I don't know
two folks just this morning this is this
morning so this morning EVGA wanted to
clear out some 980 eyes and I was going
to share that with you guys and say hey
I need ci for two bucks that's pretty
good deal of yeah they apparently have
also left these are just on auto notify
not surprised I'm at four per household
via these are just the reference design
980ti is who knows if more of them will
come back and stock are you allowed to
say how much we got ours for on
scrapyard worse since the episodes
already out yeah yeah so I was going to
say if we want to talk about scrapyard
worse which if you guys we're gonna do
Q&amp;amp;A and shortly here feel free to ask us
we'll talk about stuff going up to the
episode three yeah again episode 4 so
the final one is outs a lot of people
have seen that on flow plane and I've
did you watch episode plans in yeah I
did watch episode four already so try to
separate and not do spoilers from out so
four walls right while still disgusting
stuff right up to episode three mhm I
guess what we're saying but yeah well
let's we'll come back to that in a
minute this a couple more quick actually
just one last news story here and this
kind of goes in line with the Computex
stuff as well
asus x 399 so um this is I think the
other big exciting news from Computex
which is thread Ripper is a thing and it
is a thing in so much that not just it's
been talked about but there-there is
actually at least one motherboard based
on it that's been shown off and this is
the Asus one I believe Kyle and I both
talked about this and our videos
covering Computex so you might already
be somewhat familiar with it but thread
Ripper the motherboards that thread
Ripper is going to sock it into are
pretty massive beastly boards it's
really cool to see something like this
from AMD
because Intel's been ruling the high-end
desktop space for a really long time but
huge huge old socket look at that like
face my two dies just mashed on one yeah
one chip or one CPU really yeah
basically it's like a split socket
they're four thousand ninety four pins
so it's LGA 4000 ninety four which is
three times the number of pins that rise
has with 1331 I believe 4k 4k chip yeah
the socket itself I don't know if this
is an early version and they're going to
modify this at all for user friendliness
but it looks like the socket actually
mounts with three hex screws yeah that's
weird
which is different um I mean that's fine
with me no I don't mind
screw in the socket I feel like you
rarely ever changes it's also this board
open three two one code on here which I
in three second one yeah see oh it's
just the order right open to the border
what you want is even one and such close
one two three close one all right so one
and then probably these are two and
three I have to guess interests yeah
yeah okay that's fun um order matters if
it does beyond that uh you know it's
it's it's a high-end AMD board from Asus
so there's a new new name for it zenith
asus so ACS I like with their rog lineup
at least has a very clear naming pattern
for all their boards like rampage is
their lineup for high-end desktop Intel
so rampage it's a rampage to the number
for the series and then they have
formula extreme impact on sometimes gene
right so we formula is pretty high-end
extremes use of the highest end other
they have hero now as well that cancel
on their impact more is Mini ITX and
gene is is micro ATX
so that's rampage for high-end into
until hand desktop and then there's
Maximus which is Intel mainstream right
then there's crosshair which is AMD
mainstream mm-hm and now there is zenith
which is AMD high and that's a brand new
yep think so this is zenith extreme i
guess it would be z1e since it's the
first line of zine of zenith stuff from
asus new beginnings origin stories and
yeah yeah so uh other than that i mean
like just you know look at
look at all the stuff on here you know
there's the board you put that stuff in
PCB plugs down here you've got a you dot
- look at that SATA ports got some some
MDOT twos on there - they do have at a
press room button all right yeah the dev
the USB Jen use 3.1 gen2 that's also
connecting up there oh and the dim got
to slot which is which is the thing
they've done on their extreme boards
which is basically a dim slot that they
have rewired and plugged in with a dim
riser card that has an MDOT to slot in
it yeah which is kind of fun
I think you can put two and two zine
right that's what's happening now and
are people seeing this right now perfect
this pub can't hit the right keys no
this week sponsors they're labeled Paul
all the keys are labeled Suites sponsor
is not gigabyte all right um anyway the
biggest news that Andy announced other
than this is continuing to be a thing is
that it's launching in summer so by the
end of summer I guess August late August
and then it has 64 PCIe lanes so 64 is
more than 44 true and that's cool who
knows how they'll be configured we don't
know which of those 64 PCIe lanes will
be available for what things whether it
is PCI expansion slots through the
chipset peripheral connectivity over
there or whatnot but um it is it is cool
that there's many of them because it's
definitely going to be something AMD can
say again to put the screws to Intel's
like oh you're eight core only has 28
PCIe lanes yep you know our six core has
64 some or who knows sure I mean maybe
not 64 they're factual yeah they're
starting with 16 I don't know there's
much speculation with tonight yeah
alright let's let's answer some
questions if anyone has asked questions
I'm assuming they're all gonna be about
scrapyard wars which are only a whiff
all right Geordi and Keller thank you
for the $2 donation he said
you guys are late oh we were I was
protecting on time for twitch yeah
forget to slightly late so must be a
YouTube watcher I sorry I'm sorry
alright you've clearly never seen the
show before automatic met for the $5 hey
guys welcome back sorry I missed the
last show I had the wrong time also any
gaming speakers at Computex I did not
check out a single gaming speaker I
don't know is that thing I mean Razer
has like a gaming speaker to do right
they've got the bar just a single bar Oh
like a surround bar I think that's maybe
like AB you know just like for your
desktop maybe I don't know I feel like I
haven't really seen many gaming speakers
in general lately let's get a clip a 2.1
set up just get just good some
headphones or nice it's Daniel drew Zach
for the $2 yeah III soon III admit that
might be a question huh going to III I'm
not going know where that is I'm not
going either
p3 is very close to us but it's also too
much too much is it next week games and
not enough hardware I think I think so
yeah yeah Brian Webb two dollars how do
I use the two pin thermal sensors on my
motherboard you just you just plug them
into the pins on the motherboard where
they go and you stick them wherever you
where any hotspots that you want to
monitor yeah really anywhere in your
case that you want to put you just use a
little bit of tape or typically
everyone's ignite your motherboard will
come with a little thermistor yeah she's
a little little dude on the animal
thermal probe probe and that just leads
over so you plug that in and then you
just put that probe wherever you want it
anywhere you want isn't a literally
anywhere yeah just tape it down and then
anyway if you're talking about something
like in like an Asus Tough Series board
or something like that then usually go
in and load up the software for that and
that will allow you to get the readings
for that thermal probe oh yeah yeah
Anthony Anthony Anthony from tweak town
he says love you guys he's thrashing
aetherium right now with 11 GPUs for PCs
see he didn't even know I didn't even
have to give us that donation beat
seriously because he loves us I'm on cuz
he knows we're making that YouTube money
which is me
and exactly heute poor guys on YouTube
here you go
Thank You Anthony that was truly uh Nate
penny with five dollar donation he said
welcome back guys what was each of your
favorite moments of Computex 2017
favorite moment moment we're talking
about our favorite tech in my half-butt
moment um hmm some of those dinners we
had are pretty epic yeah I had um so it
was also my my fifth anniversary with my
wife and she came out for the second
towards the end of the week and we got
to hang out for a while and have a short
vacation there at the end and we
wouldn't have this dinner and I had pate
he's actually it was actually duck duck
pate there's a second time you had it at
that place right yeah it's uh the first
time I had it was our one-year
anniversary there and it was just really
really good and they haven't had that
exact same dish but I had that again it
was really good
and of course I was there as my wife
which was lovely as well so that's
probably my favorite moment nice
it's beautiful pull yeah um mine was the
chicken story which I told you
exhaustively about the chickens oh yeah
me and my my editor Chris we were
obviously ordering something ordering
food at a restaurant the English English
the menu was not in English our was very
loosely translated and turned out we
both ordered a whole chicken a piece and
the server brought out each of us a
whole chicken put it down the table and
immediately all the locals in the
restaurant just started like laughs out
loud like law like straight law in the
restaurant and we were both like we both
turned like beet red and like like
basically face pawn the whole rest of
the way even like the server's are
laughing was it was lawful and also
the most memorable moment of the trip
probably but well cumputer that was
those pretty classy yeah yeah we saw
that one yeah all right thanks mates
Colton Spears $5 donation rx4 80s are
getting bids on eBay over $450 so gosh
even if you got a four afforded Series
which I mean it's cool still players
it's nuts
so yeah a great time to get good resale
value on your GPU I guess
that's crazy how much they're going for
right now Ryan Baker five dollar
donation I make like $20 a week mining
aetherium on a gtx 1060 it's good money
all right so if you already got the GPU
um you know and again if you're
somewhere where it electricity doesn't
cost that much like where I guess if
your parents paint no don't do that oh I
don't want anyone mining on their
parents electrical bill this bill
they'll find out that we mad at you will
be another way Mossberg and the talking
of fi ended it was our fault summer
calvin klein $5 thank you so much
paid linus to watch scrapyard whirs
here's your cut best quote is I can feel
the bus of bearing down on me I should
get out of the way that's from the last
oh okay yes yeah I watched that part
you're right you're right it's a good
thing I want to say that no I said we're
so that it's sorry we can't we
can't get into the last Calvin thank you
for your definition Anthony Anthony
donated another $5 geez anything Anthony
thank you so much I'm so glad thanks bro
we're getting that tweaked down trickle
down love you getting that tweaked and
money now exactly yeah Pat Bowles $10
donation hey guys
I like both your show keep up the good
work Thank You Pat we certainly shall
Fred rants $20 donation love your show
it's like Sheldon Cooper meets Lauren
Laurel and Hardy alright I don't get
that reference
Sheldon Cooper is from Big Bang Bang
Theory Lord Lord Laurel and Hardy is
there like an old duo of old gangsters
Emal's sweet right
that's a good match okay all right
that's the case mr. mom $20 donation
thank you thank you very much luck on
your sex change it loves it I don't want
to impose gender rules
Bobby jr. $10 donation the PCI Express
Lanes are a disappointment on the new in
tells how many PCI Express Lanes are
available on the X 299 motherboards and
does it make up for the lack of lands on
the CPU well Bobby just clarify you're
the PCI Express Lanes are strictly on
the CPU the PSA controller is part of
the CPU so depending the CPU you get you
might have 16
twenty-eight or forty-four those are
then connected via traces to other
places on the motherboard so all your
PCI Express expansion slots your your
your chips item rather side possibly
directly over to m dot 2 or u dot to
expansion slots for SSDs so if you
dropped in a 16 Lane a chip into the
board
you only have 16 lanes available and
it's up to the motherboard manufacturer
where to direct those so you might have
full connectivity for everything with a
44 Lane PC at 44 PCI Express line CPU
dropping a KB like X and suddenly it's
like only your top PCIe slot will work
it by 8 right that's eight that's
available and then maybe 2 m dot 2 slots
that are on there 4 and 4 that's 16 yeah
that's what you got everything else just
won't work right so that's that's kind
of how that works
maybe printers thanks for the donation
of stark Harl
sorry stark early $5 donation sorry I
can't watch the stream working at the
brewery tonight hopefully I'll be
sending beer soon but for now here's
something towards the vier funf oh thank
you very much oh you have to work at
brewery I feel so bad for you that's
supposed to be challenging G all the
time probably hey I mean anyone whose
might be sending us beer hey hell yeah
thanks dark eighty ciao I always have to
say your name like that baby I have a
4770k thinking of upgrading not because
I need to but more because I want to I
do play with some 4k editing yay or nay
if it is within the budget then go for
it yeah it's something you enjoy it's
something you're going to use a lot it's
something you're gonna you're gonna feel
happy that you've taken the time to
invest in and you'll see something out
of your work that's what building
computers is all about I think you
should go for it what if we just like
straight up just recommend out X 299
after we just precise it heavily totally
Z 79 we go for the 7907 989 80 X what I
still haven't remember I know it's tough
in one confusing the hell I called David
some new car David Oh Lou it Oh in what
four dollars love the channel we love
you yes thank you so much Alex d he's
got the D and the $10 D nation love the
show and both your channels no question
just wanted to say thanks for being so
awesome thanks Alex thank you Alex good
we love you Aaron Williams
six Eric dollars in 66 cents so metal
keep up the great work you too sir you
rock on Anthony again keys and now you
know what you know funny is that we
always give him a hard time like tweets
out a hard time for all the ads but
that's easy that's the money we're
getting ad revenue right now from that
site okay so awesome I'm all for a
beautiful
bring on the ads man thanks Anthony that
it's just the tip he said he was gonna
give me Computex food
planet vampire calm five dollar donation
thank you with consoles with varying
Hardware several api's multi-gpu new cpu
architectures and focus on CPU quick
outs predictions on how game devs
handle uh
very carefully yeah so I I can't I can't
I can't give it a very direct answer to
that but I will say that Andy's Hardware
has been in the consoles for quite some
time and AMD has been working on
standardizing more what is known as the
the phrases use is close to the metal ap
is when it comes to video game
developments and that's what like
DirectX 12 and Vulcan do so the
standardization of that theoretically
will help to ease the transition of work
between developing games for consoles as
well as a PC and correct me if I'm Ron
Paul but I feel like a lot of games that
come out these days like are initially
developed for console because it's where
a lot of the line shares there's a lot
of talk about not not about that
transitioning some over the past year or
two right because pc has been gaining so
much right but I just mean like in sort
of like recent years that's why you have
like a PC ports like the PC port follows
sort of the initial console version and
so I feel like it's up to the you know
for PC developers I feel like they
really have it more
Boult I feel like it's sort of
standardized or you know like the
console developers get to set the stage
sort of and then the PC port has to sort
of follow that and I feel like there are
more expectations and requirements for
PC gamers and for PC developers to sort
of make the the experience a bit more
flexible and open then than a
traditional console experience so I
don't know does that make any sense or
kinda I mean kind of maybe I don't know
I feel like that I feel like it's the
burden is more heavily put onto the the
PC that like the PC ports and and PC
game developers well I think I think if
they're emulating a initial console game
I mean those make the standard like I
think you're right that consoles have
were dominant for quite some time but
like I said PC gaming has has gained so
much on the console market in the past
few years that and because of the
standardization of a lot of hardware and
the api's that are being used in
development it's being more it's
becoming more common either that the
games are developed for all platforms
from the get-go or that they're simply
developed on the platform that's already
using hardware that's so similar to the
PC that's porting it to PC is is is more
easy but I think right now it's right
now we're seeing more of like you want
to hit everything the PC is as much of a
viable gaming platform as Xbox or as
PlayStation so if there's a triple-a
game
it's in development unless it's one of
those exclusive titles it's like one of
those you know you got to get this
platform to play that game it's becoming
yeah yeah I'm seeing more if it's like
it releases everywhere because they want
to hit as much of the market as they can
oh yeah so okay but playing a vampire
thank you for that question
Dylan O'Neil thank you for your $5
donation love you guys I'm deleting my
67 order k and would like both of your
blessings that would be all square bless
you much a square is an icon an emoticon
that we can't see may your living be
fruitful and prosperous yes Dylan please
be very careful I've recently seen
actually I just got under Bauer deleting
KITT who did I mean is he live that
yeah he gave me one it's it's for LGA
1150 1151 so that's specific type um
just remember what you're doing you're
basically taking a seal between the heat
spreader and the substrate on the PCB
and the PCB that the CPU sits in then
you're attempting to shift that cap
enough to break that seal but not enough
that you're lifting off that might crack
the die or that you're pushing sideways
too quickly that might slide to the side
and perhaps scrape off the tops of some
surface mount devices that might be on
there so be careful do lots of research
beforehand but a lot of people say that
they get some pretty nice temperatures
once I do that because that's certainly
something that Intel has not been using
the best possible material they can with
is the the solder and the not solder the
Tim that they use between the heat
spreader and the CPU itself yeah good
luck villain JK software $20 donation
thanks to both of you for your coverage
of Computex and ease back from the dead
Vesey lat cpu line up in 15 years JK i
absolutely agree 15 years not 15 years
1111 ages 11 to 12 years affected FX
series that's when that Vic series came
out uh but thank you so much for your
donation
Larry cat man nine one three five six
$10 donation you guys Rock what is the
beat man what it is uh it's I don't know
what the name is I think it was in the
letter that I had but I don't know if I
had letter anymore
from from from you know who maybe you
know who you are in the conformance and
Mark Bell yes that's bad time you
actually killed it Jesus
hey I'm freaking like freaking rookie
Anthony Anthony G again with another
five dollar donation is Anthony always
maybe Anthony's not usually safe while
we do the show
awesome hardware down under do it does
that mean down and - it means he wants
us to go to Australia
I wouldn't mind visiting us too
yeah hey you know what when we Paul what
about let's say we mean you I know we
don't usually go to these events but
what if we went to pack South pax
Australia you mean a pock pax Australia
yeah I mean I'm totally down for that
and just just just to really chill out
in Australia maybe shoot a few cool
videos at the event I've heard Australia
is a really cool place to be like an
epic you know collab vlog and and you
know trying to eaten by spiders some
wolf spiders right giant spiders I feel
like it's funny we both said spiders
this is a very familiar where the mind
goes Thank You Anthony thanks man
let's figure out when that when that
event is mm-hmm or TriNet $2 donation
Kyle needs glasses in the logo - Kyle
wear your glasses I guess any glasses he
wasn't wearing glasses as frequently
when the logos first made I know you a
cold five dollar donations so I'm trying
to wrap my mind around PC a lanes of
noisy 270 bored and my 7702 k can I run
SLI and to m dot to SSDs you a coal no
you cannot no well ok it depends on the
board and depends on the breakdown of
lanes you like alright so for SLI you
need to hate no you can't you can't
press L you need to buy eight
connections that's in videos requirement
so you're using up all 16 of your PCIe
lanes from your 77 we don't Eckstein
that's right yeah so um the rest of the
lanes that are part of that does is up
20 I'm thinking of risin risin has 20
there's a 24 22 is 26 Gen 3 lanes and
then 4 then the 2.0 lanes are dependent
on the chipset yeah so you get 8 with X
370 with 77 Hunter K you also have 4
PCIe gen3 lanes which are dedicated to
the DMI which is the direct media
interface whatever it is that's the
connection between the CPU and the
chipset those are broken out via
basically a glorified switch to connect
up all of your other peripheral
connectivity so you might have some MDOT
2's down there those can potentially
connect through the chipset to the CPU
in tandem with your 2 by 8 PCIe
Lane connections for your SLI
configuration where GPUs so that's the
way that you'd be able to do that but
remember you're using four PCI gen3
lanes
let's switch right there so you might
introduce a tiny bit of latency you're
not always going to get the exact full
speed of the SSDs that way but again
that depends on the motherboard and it
depends on what they've done with those
lanes
those lanes kept going through the dish
to the chipset and what they connect to
sometimes they'll connect to like extra
PCIe slots on the motherboard sometimes
it'll be 2 m dot 2 slots sometimes it'll
be u dot 2 slots so yeah if you got
those coming off your chipset though
then yes you should be able to connect
that hope that makes sense
lucky dog 2500 $5 think of any new Intel
CPUs will beat the 77 77 hundred K in
terms of gaming streaming chip saying
yes yeah gaming prob maybe maybe maybe
the 6 quart I'm gonna obviously get
higher you get higher clock speeds I
don't know what the IPC is so one other
one of the theories for the KB Lake X
CPUs is that they're month mainly
focused on overclocking overclocking and
that they're not even like practical
chips for people who want to use them
and just like I want to make a quad core
see core computer don't get X 299 get X
get Z 270 build something on that X 299
with the quad cores might just be
something that they're building out so
that people can break break overclocking
records on and I believe there's a
little bit on your half isn't there
I may be knackered no okay maybe it was
just something that I read earlier today
though I read earlier today a leak about
a KB like X chip hitting 5 gigahertz on
on air or something like that I'm I'm
jet like I'm Jeff like ok oh yeah
they're supposed to get better for Katie
Lee kicks is supposed to be better for
overclocking I believe that's also
clocked 100 megahertz higher than
existing KB like chips and it's going to
have a higher TVP as well so might need
a better cooling solution but um so yes
it's that well there will bolt there
will be better CPUs in particularly for
gaming and streaming honestly with it
any CPU that's a 6
or or higher should be better at gaming
and streaming at the same time thanks to
the additional cores that are available
yeah or input encoding on the fly'
definitely but yet again a lot still
remains to be seen individual reviews in
benchmarks not like NSF stuff yeah do
look do mons
the dollar donation oh my god myself so
how many to go where is this all coming
to everything we got bring to these
quick we have it thank you to the months
James Duncan $2 donation think Samsung
will branch out other PC PC parts they
already do a lot I don't see them
expanding much beyond the vehicle was
going through definitely do CB course
oh cool missed xtube $2 Canadian
any news about the 4k 144 Hertz displays
I went to the Acer predator area at
Computex and they're just like hey look
we still have the X 27 it's awesome but
there was nothing new about it with
everything that was an answer that a
suppress event is what we know now
that's what I saw was the new Asus 35
inch 34 44 CRT HDR 200 Hertz that was
pretty sweet g-sync display who knows
God knows how much that's gonna cost
probably way too much project phoenix
media $2 donation jays too sexy
obviously should put that upside down
chain w a hundred and fifty dollar
donation my god
huh turn aw what's a 150 a it's a
hundred and fifty is I don't know that's
a lot of a that means it's it's a it's
probably worth way more a it's a is here
maybe came by us yeah
Thank You Shane for your donation Fred
ranch $5 donation Laura and hard we're a
comedy team way back in the day Laurel
and Hardy I was totally listen they're a
gangster that's it but they did they
play gangsters Laurel and Hardy and I'm
choose your next words carefully palm
gonna blame that you have to say for
yourself jail I like you gotta be a
sting
unity is no more Tino Diaz $10 donation
thank you for that Joseph Parish one
dollar donation thank you very much for
that as well
Jason partridge in a pear tree $20
donation you're both awesome haven't
been to the hardware game in it in the
hardware game in about ten years you
guys are a great refresher thank you so
much
I hope the things that we've told you
are correct Tino Diaz another $10
donation sell my 980ti
by a 1080i or wait for Vega I have a
6700 K I'd wait wait wait right now
because of 90 TI is still totally good
card and a great pair for 67 or 2 K yeah
Adam Jager $10 donation you guys were
awesome in scrap yards we do you have
called out Intel for the i9 BS had Linus
not made that video of course I feel
like most of community or following his
lead on the issue Adam I'd like to
sincerely say that I would call it out
either way because we have been talking
about how little sense the KB Lake X
CPUs make since they were rumors weeks
and weeks ago and although I was not as
a like I'm going to walk around like an
emo person outside in Taipei and be
super upset about this in my video with
dramatic music in the background I did a
good week before Linus this video raised
several questions about the validity of
some of the CPUs that they're bringing
outs as well as just some of the very
difficult to deal with configurations
when it comes to the PCI Express step
maybe you should be asking Linus if he
would have made that video had Paul not
made this video first maybe that maybe
it was based on might be interested no
probably not but I mean I mean I think
it's I think it's helpful to have lots
of different voices in the tech world
talk about these kinds of things and
yeah okay Miguel aguado 299 thank you
thank you very much bu l Alan Hernandez
$5 donation love you guys and you have
some content they keep it up thank you
very much you x-ray gaming $5.00
chug-chug-chug all right all right
here's why we do that now people know
they can just donate saving magus
chugger say if you have just a parish $5
donation ex half could cross-firing my
four gig 480 with my a cake 580 cause
micro studying with a cave jacob 88
downscaling NVRAM tomate from my
understanding no but you will only use
four gigs of your v-rooms so you know I
don't know you'll probably have some
games where that would help and some
games where it would not help or even
hurt yeah Greg toughs $5 donation I'm
going in a custom loop I want to get a
1080p I do get a reference card or we
wait for the kingpin
uh you know if you want to guaranteed
better overclocker maybe go for the
kingpin but most GPUs are going to still
overclock the same amount regardless of
everything else that the manufacturer
throws at the board's just how it works
with the 10 series less you'll be paying
significantly more for the kingpin much
yes so if you want the best bang for
your buck just get a reference yep
Anthony again good lars end the
ordination need to talks about pax
Australia I'll support you in any way
Jesus all right Thank You Anthony yes
stop donating lean times you donate it
up okay miss DEXA till your money $2.00
canadian to knee to knee for making use
of youtube life well to need we're just
doing our due diligence chase $2.00
predictions on rise and threes effect on
budget gaming it'll be good yeah it'll
be awesome more more more more options
yeah wifey ong $5 donation no question
to swallow say thank you for giving my
hubby something enjoys he enjoys each
week that sounds that sounds awesome
yeah only vaguely said genuinely do
thank you pay thank you for the donation
though pesky penguin $2 donation can you
speak on ransomware and protection
versus builds what's that mean hmm if
you want to protect yourself from
ransomware
set up an ass with ZFS which does
incremental backups which are right I'm
sorry which are read-only which means
that even if you get ransomware you have
read-only backups that can only be read
which means it can never be and just
locked up and Rea encrypted or something
like the only yeah that's that's
honestly the like one of the best just
not that complicated at home solutions
you can do destroy your consider or just
like be be sensible when you're browsing
the internet and don't open attachments
for people they don't know and all that
kind of stuff lucky dog 24 $10 donation
thank you any reason the six score has a
lower clock speed than the eight core
seems weird
probably segmentation they want to make
sure that as you spend more money you
get a better experience and you get a
faster processor more time I usually do
that with the out of the clock out of
the box speeds but they're all
overclockable this time thank God so so
yeah I mean I guess they've all been
overclockable and that's popular so
bigger they're not they're not doing
that like it here's the here's the entry
level that would enthusiasts platform
one that you can't overclock that was
I can see them doing them but they did
all right lucky dog 24 $5 Congrats Paul
and beating everyone in the
liquid-nitrogen overclocking challenge
okay to be to clarify I beat all the
youtubers I were I read several articles
by other people from other other you
know like written establishments who
they actually got higher than that they
did pretty well with that chip though
they were getting well over seven
gigahertz with it which is nice
Monkeyface nine $25 donation I learned a
lot about tech from you guys channels
and recently installed automotive RAM in
my car I'm now running two engines in
sli automotive Ram that's what we're
here for
well you can download more that if you
want Polytech fle computer mind $5
donation hey guys new builder here
always looking for feedback love your
content well the feedback is that thank
you thank you for your donation thanked
feedback David Garcia five dollar
donation I have an SLI 1070 i7 6700k
Asus z170a build and scandal is blocking
the text with its work and when I render
in Sony Vegas 13 it won't detect neither
of my GPS at all tried every setting I
don't use Vegas very much but I would
consider disabling SLI I know depending
on the software it may or may not be
able to take advantage of your GPUs GP
computability while SLI is turned on but
again I don't use Vegas very much so I'm
probably not a very good resource for
that joshua h $10 donation thank you so
much
hey guys hope you content I have a 4790k
with a crack in X 52 and push/pull OC to
4.7 gigahertz at one point to five volts
want to push more research is giving
mixed answers
what is this safe voltage to increase
with the 4790k you don't want to go too
high as well was not very tolerant at
much higher voltage so every five you
could probably go to one three to five
which is probably the most I'd run want
to run if you're talking long term yeah
I mean you see yeah but honestly your
4.7 as it is know near your towards the
top end of what that CPU can do the
golden chip 4770k s could hit four seven
four six four seven 4790k we're a bit
better so um you know you might be able
to get you might be lippisch it up for
it four eight four nine you know you're
already at the peak where
more voltage the equation is going to
like give you incremental increase in
performance but way more heat and
probably decrease the longevity of your
trip if you're running at 24/7 so you've
kind of hit like a plateau I feel like
you're not gonna I feel like four seven
at one point two five is a nice smaller
you should be happy when four sevens
very solid yeah all right Shane W fifty
dollar donation drink it all in one go
oh my god
fifty dollars oh wait fifty a what is a
we don't know if that's like more than
fifty US or if it's like two pesos
Corona there's something like that I
don't know okay I'm gonna get I'm gonna
go one two three and we'll just check
for that that period okay okay here we
go
cheers Cheers
okay yeah most of it yep right Thank You
shame this week on it one abuelo
Alex of a half a show night dollar
donation all right we're almost to the
end for almost to the end so the thing a
high-end reg but rigged but still want
to save only once an SSD for storage so
which would be better at one terabyte
Samsung 850 Evo or pro I go for the Evo
now the pros faster yeah but it also
alright more if the if the price
difference is minimal then go for the
pro because it is faster but I'd say the
Evo is is kind of your bang for the buck
but um some definitely you get most of
the performance of the pro and it's only
some very specific situations where
you'll actually even notice the
difference between those email versus
pro is basically correct me if I'm wrong
like synchronous versus asynchronous
Nan's is that the main difference there
I don't want to say yes to that no guys
I don't know for sure okay
I'd have to look at the specs again I
don't keep that in my head at least I
tried to but it's gone okay
oh yeah the Evo is a really good really
good drive for the money
x-ray gaming $5 donation drink in one go
we already did that we're finished
let's do it
Vincent Lam five dollars Canadian hey
guys I'm building a new computer running
an i7 6700k which motherboard should I
use an RG Maximus 9 heroes II 270 or an
MSI z 270 giving m7 are you buying that
are you for your bro buying that if
you're buying the board I'd say the
gaming m7 because I feel like that costs
we know the hero the heroes not too
expensive get the hero yeah I like the
hero if the hero is probably cheaper if
it yeah I like the hero if the pricing
is is equivalent yeah go for the hero
okay there we go I like issue spicy take
up a take away with two dollars have you
considered doing a Dan a four bill yes
yes ma'am Cal has okay friend ran its
fifty dollars I wonder if Intel's
playing possum and will increase the
lanes of high-end I 9 to 64 your
thoughts Fred I doubt it because
typically that's not something that they
can just turn on and off yeah um yeah
and again we only know that there are 64
PCI Express gen3 lanes on thread River
we again don't know how they're
configured if there is strict in one way
or the other there still remains more to
be seen there so they could totally
change it though yeah they could make
thread I'm sorry they could change they
could um they could make the high end
what if they just made the high end
wriggle hop the HCC the high tape make
sure your half-breed okay fine right
Shane W 550 dollars its Australian fifty
dollars Australian come here which is
fine we all know we already know that 75
percent of a dollar which is still
plenty alright and we'll go to Australia
soon very soon see s 188 creations last
donation five dollars I need a low
profile graphics card from my dad small
form-factor PC would you recommend the
GT 1030 is best bang for the buck
no no GT 1030 I haven't tested it I
haven't tested either but it's new it's
very inexpensive and there's passively
cool versions of it again without having
tested it myself
I'd say yes because I think they're only
about 60 or 70 dollars and I've heard
good things about them oh well in that
case do it okay we need to end my half
we've already gone way over time thank
you so much for watching
we're going to be continuing Cal's half
of the show
we have two Johnston's Tito oh my god
Johnson's Tito thank you for picking up
an overclocking ceramic mug and a words
in a circle pint glass yeah
and finally Brian Brian thank you very
much prenup estate positive shirt I'm
gonna go to the bathroom while you read
off yours okay
Christopher also gets a Johnson thumb
screw decal thank you so much
Christopher Brian from Michigan Johnson
for the thumb screw black t-shirt thank
you for that and finally Brian Brian
gets a double Johnson right right Kyle
said I think Kyle said that all right
Brian from from Nevada thank you so much
for that as well thanks to guys watching
my half of the show we'll be continuing
with Kyle's half very shortly the link
to his half is in my video's description
right down there will be still staying
live on Twitch I'm going to end my half
and then soon soon I will get to sleep
yes yes forever sleep peace peace</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
