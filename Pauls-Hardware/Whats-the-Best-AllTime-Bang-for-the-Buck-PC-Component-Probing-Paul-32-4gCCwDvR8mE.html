description below what's up guys welcome
back to Pauls hardware this is probing
Paul episode number 32 this is my
monthly Q&amp;amp;A answer tech questions random
questions whatever you guys happen to
ask and I always start out by looking at
past probing falls that's its history
right there that's a long portal looking
into the past which is very meaningful
but if you guys have any questions for
next month's feel free to leave those
down in the comments section below
I am going to start answering questions
that are derived from last month's video
from that comment section starting with
dark oak River unko here who says good
job so far with you since the newing
days will positive pressure air flow in
a case hurt my components temperature
and also are any plans for the 1 million
subs milestone I am hoping to hit a
million subs soon I'm very excited about
that I don't know anything too specific
planned except there is gonna be a
giveaway that a few vendors have already
volunteered to participate with and then
I'll hopefully be getting my 1 million
subs plaque and everything which I've
been looking forward to for many many
years since I've been in YouTube for
like almost 10 years now give or take
back to your actual question though when
it comes to positive pressure in a case
your main concern when it comes to
positive or negative pressure is gonna
be with dust and dust buildup if you
have positive pressure as long as
there's somewhere for the air to escape
you should be okay and it shouldn't
affect temperatures at least if you're
comparing positive versus negative air
flow so that's the general perspective
on that positive it's generally
preferred because it will cause less to
build up of dust inside your case next
question from Dustin Pannell he says for
the probe does vertical versus
horizontal installation matter with an
all-in-one cooler and I believe he's
talking about the radiator here he's
seen both but never compared the two and
the man his manufacturer manual says to
install his horizontally also he's
following up on what people have planned
for 2019 that I asked last month he says
he's got a new baby girl expected mid to
late February congratulations Dustin
new baby girl you said you haven't seen
this done but I'm actually going to link
in the description three different
videos one is from Kyle who I often work
with and he did a comparison a couple
years back I already got over a million
views his conclusion was that yes it
does matter and putting the radiator
vertically in the front of the case did
a little bit better for him however
that's not borne out and all the tests
you compare side-by-side so there's a
link to Jay's video and he did this back
in 2015 as well comparing front mounted
radiators to the top mounted radiator
and then there's also a Linus tech tip
video this is from 2016 that Luke did
where he compared radiator fan
configuration and whether or not that
matters so feel free to check out those
videos but I'm going to give you an
answer that you're probably not gonna
like as much was which is that it
depends on your specific scenario it
also depends on what the radiator is
connected to chances are you're talking
about a CPU radiator so if you put a CPU
radiator as an intake at the front of
the case and the CPU has a heavy load on
it that's gonna get warmer and warmer
over time and it's gonna increase the
ampion ambient temperature of your
entire case and probably increase your
GPU temperatures that's said if you put
it at the top with fresh air coming in
from the front your GPU temperatures
might be lower but your CPU temperature
might be hotter it depends on what's
being cooled on the software that's
being run on the case itself on how many
overall fans are in the case so the only
real way to tell for you what the best
radiator placement is is just to try
them both try it in the top try it in
the front see which one works better for
you next question here from Thailand who
says hey if all of the videos I own an
EVGA GTX 1080 Ti for the wind three I
don't wish to overclock it because it's
already got a factory OC just wants to
monitor it and keep it nice and cool
beyond the Nvidia control panel but I
recommend any other software for an
example precision xoc so Talyn my
initial answer would be you probably
don't need any additional software if
you're not planning on doing any more
overclocking but you did mention that
you want to keep an eye on temperatures
and the Nvidia control panel actually
doesn't do that so one thing you might
want additional software for is just to
keep an eye on the temperatures just to
see what they're at also get an idea
what they're at now so that like six
months down the road you can look at
them again and be like oh I usually run
it you know 60 degrees C on my GPU while
I'm gaming and now I see it's up to
eighty or so maybe I should get in there
and clean the dust out if you want to
monitor GPU temperatures
software I like to use this hardware
info 64 HW info 64 that'll actually get
you monitoring for a bunch of different
stuff in your computer if that's too
over-the-top you can definitely try EVGA
is precision XOC which is very good
software and will also allow you to
monitor to the temperatures and adjust
fan speed and stuff like that which can
be fun
the other cool thing that precision x OC
will allow you to do is control the RGB
lighting on your graphics card which you
may or may not want control over ups so
those are some of the benefits you can
get by going with additional software
but for your purposes I'd say you mainly
just want something to keep an eye on
that temperature and like I said that's
mainly for long-term use so you can see
what you're used to running out when
it's nice and clean and new and keep an
eye on it and see if temperatures go up
over time next up is mr. Meech who wants
to add storage to his PC he wants a four
terabyte drive but he's noticed that two
two terabyte drives you can get for
about twenty to forty bucks cheaper than
a single four terabyte drive I'm
assuming you're talking about mechanical
storage here if you got the room in your
case and you have available SATA ports
what are the pros and cons of going with
two drives versus one I'm going to touch
on three things here when it comes to
the difference one is if you have two
drives you can set up raid that is if
your motherboard has a RAID controller
built into it that you can enable and
raid actually it's pretty useful in
certain circumstances you can mirror the
two drive so you get the same data on
both or you can stripe the two drives
with raid zero meaning it combines them
both together so you only see a single
four terabyte drive in your operating
system and it would probably run a
little bit faster when it comes to read
and write speeds if you're running raid
0 vs. a single drive that said raid 0 is
also known as zero redundancy which
means that if one of those drives dies
you lose all of the data so that's not
always a recommended configuration if
you're talking about something that you
want some data integrity with that leads
into my second point which is that with
two drives you have two potential points
of failure if you're using them both
separately then that means you could
have one drive die that the loose stuff
on and still have the other functional
drive if you're using the raid
configuration then one drive will kill
your entire array or if you're using
raid 1 you can lose a drive and you'd
still have all your data on the second
drive but if you're talking about a
simpler solution where you're not using
raid and you just have two individual
drives then the main functional
difference is going to be that with two
drives you have two separate drives to
put stuff on to so you're going to need
to start your data between the two of
those manually which usually isn't a big
concern but beyond that it's just a
matter of the extra drive will use a
little bit
our power although that's mostly
negligible and maybe generate a little
bit more heat so hopefully all of those
factors you can assess and decide
whether you want to spend that extra 20
or 40 bucks on the single drive versus
getting to smaller ones next question is
from killer spike 9-1-1 he says what
should I use in a build for web browsing
some video streaming and some light
gaming any form factor on a small budget
so spike if you're not aware every month
I do monthly builds usually at the
beginning of the month so check out my
monthly builds video for January where I
cover a bunch of different system builds
with parts lists from PC part picker and
I go down different parts and how much
they cost what you're gonna want is
something akin to the six hundred dollar
gaming PC build that I put together
which has an r3 1200 and rx 580 but
instead of buying both of those you
should just spend ninety five bucks on
the rise in 320 200 G this will get you
a quad-core CPU which is perfectly fine
for streaming if you're talking about
1080 or 720 and it's got built in Vega
graphics there is a 2400 G that has a
better graphics integrated solution but
that's more like a hundred and seventy
bucks and at that point I start to feel
like well maybe you should just get a
separate CPU and GPU like I recommend in
the video for $600 but the point is I'll
get you a full sized ATX system with
plenty of room for expansion that
handles the things you need it to do and
it'll only cost you about 420 dollars
with today's prices which i think is a
pretty good deal that includes 16 gigs
of ram a 240 gig SSD as well as a full
size case and 600 watt power supply just
a few more questions ago this one from a
friend of the show yo to ninja he says
when switching from an APU to a
dedicated GPU do you need to run ddu and
if you're not familiar with those
acronyms apu is just like as talked
about with the 2200 g cpu and GPU and
the same chip move into a GPU so now
you're installing a graphics card and do
you need to run ddu which is display
driver uninstaller which is a
third-party app that goes into your
system digs out any display drivers
specifically so you can get a fresh
clean install if you're swapping between
graphics cards the short simple answer
here is no probably not if you're
running Windows 10 or even Windows 7 for
that matter you should just be able to
install the new graphics card load your
new drivers and it'll replace the old
driver stack with a new driver stack
what I would do is run display driver
uninstaller and then do a fresh clean
install of my drivers if I'm
specifically moving from an AMD APU
which should be using vague
and AMD Radeon drivers to an Nvidia
graphics card and that's just because I
don't know I have a thing about moving
from AMD to Nvidia one to the other back
and forth I always run ddu in between
just to make sure everything's playing
nice with each other probably not as big
of a deal if you're talking about going
from an Intel integrated graphics
solution to AMD or Nvidia but yes to me
it's kind of the same thing as like a
Windows installation yes you could
probably do an upgrade or an in-place
upgrade but it's just always safest and
best to do wipe it start fresh start
clean so I would run D to you personally
next question also from friend of the
show we dos L do cheat he says I'd
really like to see a walkthrough for
Renan renovating your bathroom even if
it's a vlog type video and he's always
liked my hardware videos and he enjoyed
my pun of holding my in the last
video which was obviously intentional
now Guido this was last month so I'm
guessing you probably have already seen
it but just in case you didn't I did do
the follow up to that video I didn't
want to string people along like I had
been doing with the HT PC video for so
long so there it is my bathroom it is
completed it came together very nicely
it's got cool stuff like a toilet paper
roller and everything so I'll link that
down in the description to check it out
if you missed it next question from Roy
Evans he says out of every PC part
you've ever used which one or ones have
been the best bang for your buck if
they're release he'd like one part for
each component I'm gonna do CPU and GPU
just because I don't know that much time
but also he followed up on 2019 he's
getting a new job a new car and a new
apartment and by summer a new PC built
that's a real nice set of new things Roy
so I wish you the best of luck and all
that when it comes to your question
though so for the GPU I'm gonna choose
the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 570 this actually
came out in 2010 it is a Fermi based
card but is is the second generation of
Fermi stuff which was based on 40 40
nanometer which was down from I think
what 50 or 52 nanometer from before when
I first heard the question what popped
into my head was the 70 series cards
from Nvidia because those have been very
consistent sort of middle-of-the-road
GPUs that perform well and they're not
terribly overpriced and the 570 I think
comes to mind because it was a follow up
to the 400 series the original Fermi
cards which ran really hot so they
weren't very efficient and it was just
sort of a night and day difference going
from 400 series to 500 series they were
much more efficient they ran much cooler
you could overclock them pretty well and
I think that was sort of the
start of the kickoff of like the 500
series 600 series 700 series 900 series
where Nvidia was really kind of kicking
AMD's but a close second to this would
be the GTX 970 and I know a lot of
people are gonna be like oh my god 3.5
gigs of VRAM and everything but the 970
was a really solid card for the price
very overclockable especially with some
of the aftermarket versions and I think
both of those GPUs are just GPUs that a
lot of people got a lot of people gaming
on and a lot of people gaming on a lot
and didn't have to spend you know 500
bucks plus for the CPU I'm gonna go with
the venerable Sandy Bridge Core i5 2500
k still available at Amazon for two
hundred and eighty dollars don't don't
buy it don't buy it now it's not worth
the money anymore but the 2500 K and the
2600 K to me or the last time when I was
like Intel was just like dominating and
not just dominating because they had
good products but they were also
compelling products at the prices you
could get them for the 2500 K you could
usually get for 200 to 220 issue dollars
overclocking was amazing on it you could
crank up the voltage you could get so
much more performance out of it if
you're willing to go in and tweak and
tune a few things so to me it's kind of
the consummate DIY PC product because it
lets you do something yourself build
your own PC and then do something with
it where you're like this is totally
worth it for me I was able to do
something that most people can't do to
get more performance and more for my
money so when you talk bang for the buck
2500 k still I'd say is the high points
for Intel and if Intel wants to redeem
themselves in the eyes of a lot of
people with AMD's competition over the
past two or three years I think what
they really need is something like the
2500 K we priced CPU that overclocked
swell you can get more performance out
of I don't know if they're actually
gonna do that but I hope they do I mean
they have the competition from AMD to
encourage them to do that so until if
you're listening please please do
another 2500 K and lastly these are
responses to the question I asked at the
end of last month's video wishes what
are you guys doing in 2019 and I just
pulled up a few people who had responded
like ty Roberts whose plans to sit stand
and potentially breathe if it is in the
budget
I understand ty a budget through Titan
2019 but we're gonna come through it
stronger than ever next up is patriotic
Oreos who says he's quitting his job on
Sunday which would have been
three weeks ago I think and he's getting
a new job in construction for the new
year so congratulations patriotic Oreos
I hope the job quitting was satisfying
and I hope the new job is treating you
well so far and finally Ryan hulls here
who gets the award for being the most
thorough because he's got like his
mother-in-law's and great grandma's
birthday rants turning 35 and he's got a
new house in Northern California they
got four 430-thousand that that's a good
deal moving in July
tons of stuff planned for this year so
you guys feel free to read over that
Thank You Ryan for sending that all in
have fun in Vegas and thanks to all you
guys who posted comments in last month's
video and of course post comments in
this month's video if you want me to
answer them in February which is coming
very soon thank you guys so much
watching this video this has been
probing Paul episode number 32 I'll be
