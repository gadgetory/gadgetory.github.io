click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware this is
my monthly builds video for july 2019
and this is an exciting month July
actually July 7th is the date that a lot
of people are waiting for because that's
when AMD's new CPUs and new GPUs lunch
we're still a couple days before that so
some of the stuff I'm talking about
today is a little bit forward-looking
you should definitely wait a couple days
until independent reviews come out and
check those out to reality check before
you invest in any of the bills I'm going
to talk about today but I'm getting
ahead of myself if you're gonna build a
computer you need to figure out what
parts to put in it that is what this
monthly series is all about I part out
two builds at least every month and then
I typically build one of them during the
month so stay tuned subscribe if you're
not already if you want to see me put at
least one of these systems together if
you're looking for builds today check
out my builds playlist where I have
plenty of builds available and if you're
not familiar with how to build a
computer in general then check out my
how to build a gaming PC beginner's
guide playlist because there's quite a
few different guides in there that will
walk you through the steps
today's builds are based on your
feedback from last month so check out
the video description if you want a vote
for next month's builds but we're doing
a bang for the buck then to build based
on the rise in 3600 and we're doing a
max then to build based on the 3900 X I
went for like a reasonable max not like
all-out max I might do a maximum build
maybe next month but for next month's
definitely vote you can see the
different options that I've put for you
guys there and that link is down in the
video's description let's get into it
with the first build for this month
which is gonna come in at about nine
hundred dollars I'm using PC part picker
for these build lists by the way and
they will be linked in the description
and again you're going to see some
warnings here because I'm
forward-looking some of these parts
aren't out yet specifically the rise in
3000 series stuff and then when it comes
to graphics cards I'm using Nvidia
graphics cards for both of these builds
but definitely keep your eye on the new
novel based cards that are also
launching on Sunday the RX 5700 and
our X 5700 XT and we have the rest of
the parts here I'm gonna go over these
one at a time but there's the full list
for you starting off of course with
their eyes if I had thirty six hundred
much anticipated the six core 12 thread
processor with third gen risin I don't
know the performance really yet but it's
going to cost two hundred dollars for
six cores and twelve threads yes you can
currently get first or second gen rise
in six cores for less than that but I'm
anticipating the performance here is
going to justify it's been a little bit
more for the third gen parts especially
if you're building a gaming PC pairing
this up with a B 450 motherboard rather
than X 570 for this more budget oriented
build the main thing you're giving up
here by going with B 450 is PCI Express
Gen 4 so the really really fast nvme
SSDs that are about to launch you won't
be able to take full advantage of their
speed but honestly for a gaming PC you
really do not need that just keep in
mind if you want PCI Express Gen 4
you're going to need to invest in an x5
70 series motherboard and my second
build does use one of those this is down
to a hundred dollars over on Amazon
there right now which is nice because I
felt like the price was creeping up on
this board because it is a fairly
popular one with rising builds even the
existing first and second generation
builds because it has good power
delivery you should be able to overclock
even a 12 core don't quote me on that
quite yet because we need to test it
independently but you should be able to
do a decent amount of overclocking when
to support and other than that it's got
everything you need to get up and
running for memory the sweet spot for
Rison is ddr4 thirty-six hundred at
least according to what AMD tells us but
I don't think they'd lie to us about
something like that right out of the
gates so what I've done here is a
parametric filter on PC part picker for
ddr4 3600 speed memory and then the kit
size we want is a 2 by 8 gig stick kits
ran that search sorted by price and it
is just dropping in the cheapest memory
kits that aligns with those
specifications which is only $70 it is a
g.skill sniper x kit though available on
Newegg so this must be on sale because
it is fairly not that great looking I
guess this is supposed to look match up
with the Tough Series motherboards no
your memory looks like is a lot less
important than the speed and capacity of
the memory so this is available for 4
more days if that ends you should also
keep an eye on the other kits on this
list and then definitely like I said
keep an eye out on the launch dear
reviews and especially people who are
doing memory testing because AMD
been a lot more confident about memory
compatibility with their gen Rison but
there's still chance that some kids
might play nicer than others so that is
something again to keep an eye out for
for storage I just went with a 500 gig
class SATA SSD this is the ATA 2 su 655
which is available on Amazon for about
48 dollars there's how there is
available in this price range
I do recommend sticking to brands that
you maybe have heard of before there are
even some nvme SSDs like the Intel 660 P
that come down in this range that can be
fairly competitively priced too so keep
an eye on those and you should be able
to find a 500 gig SATA SSD for about 45
to 50 dollars moving on we have a
graphics card and for that I went with
the art GX 2060 which is maintaining its
current price even with the launch of
the super cards at $350 but you can find
these on sale for even a little bit less
I went with this ZOTAC gaming card
because it actually has a decent cooler
it is well reviewed some of the more
entry-level r-tx 2060s can be pretty
under built but this one is a solid
choice so consider that but again also
consider the Radeon rx 5000 series cards
that are coming out 250 750 700 XT
because we don't have benchmarks for
those yet and you want to at least cross
compare that against the 2060 I think
for now this will be a good choice but
just keeping repeating myself in this
video because I don't often recommend
parts that aren't quite out yet but two
more days two more days we have to wait
and then we can figure all that stuff
out moving on though for a case we have
the fan Tech's Eclipse p3 50 X which has
a really nice feature sets for a case
and it's only about $60 available for 60
bucks on Newegg so consider that any
case in the 60 to $70 range that matches
your aesthetic tastes has decent reviews
and has the features you're looking for
like the same sized motherboard and
everything you'll probably be okay with
but I've worked with the p3 50 X before
it's a good case finally we need a power
supply I went with the 650 watts and
went with 80 plus bronze and I made sure
it was all black cables that's what you
need to look for
I also recommend going for a reputable
brand such as a corsair EVGA see sonic
Coolermaster and then if you can get
modularity that is convenience although
it is not absolutely necessary this one
is not modular for example but it does
still have all black cables so you make
sure that you
have any nasty cable colors standing out
in your build all that comes together
for again just under $900 this is
actually more expensive when I first put
it together last night but there was
that price break on the motherboard that
brought it down a bit so for $900 this
bill is absolutely gonna destroy games
and also have a pretty good chance doing
well for gaming and streaming or any
compute related tasks because you do
have six cores and twelve threads and
the processor I am excited to see the
performance of builds like this now that
we have this new launch coming out but
let's move on to our second build for
this month which is these $1,650 gaming
PC a bit more all out a bit more
high-end this one's using the rise in
3900 X and I paired it up with an RT X
27 T super since we now have better
prices on better performing RT X 27 t
cards with the launch of the super but
looking at the total price here I'm
actually a little bit over my sixteen
fifty sixteen hundred and fifty dollar
budget sixteen sixty 285 is what it's
coming out to but let's run down the
parts 3900 X 12 cores 24 threads on the
main stream platform really really
excited to share some performance
benchmark numbers with you guys on this
very soon again that'll be out on Sunday
I have been testing this but I can't
tell you about it yet just that it's you
should be excited it's fun the Kraken X
62 is one of the better ones on the
market this is the second revision of it
does cost about a hundred and forty
dollars so yes you couldn't get away
with the cooler that comes in the box or
save some money on a cooler but I wanted
to give it a lot of cooling so that's
why I went with that anyway for a
motherboard we have the Asus tough
gaming X 570 plus we don't have official
pricing on the motherboards yet although
a lot of them have had some details and
pictures and breakdowns and unboxings
that have already been posted I chose
this motherboard because I wanted to
reiterate and confirm with you guys not
all of the X 570 motherboards are like
upwards of $300 there are some really
expensive super overbuilt ones out there
but you don't need to spend that much to
get X 570 case in point this one I don't
know the official price for I've
estimated about 175 dollars all I know
for sure is it's gonna be sub 200 bucks
but going with something like this you
are gonna get PCI Express 4.0 supports
and then a lot of these are gonna have
pretty much the same base
characteristics when it comes to having
a few m dot two slots available for DIMM
slots so you can populate all your
memory you might miss out on a few
things such as a front panel USB
3.1 gen2 port but this board even at
least from the look of it has solid
power delivery again it's pretty early
to say for sure but I wanted to get this
build going without going too crazy over
budget and like the other motherboard
that I have available I think is gonna
be well over 300 bucks I thought this
one would be a bit more reasonable
choice for memory again I have a 2 by 8
gig ddr4 3,600 memory kits I didn't use
the parametric filter this time I
specifically chose a vengeance lpx kit
because they're not too overpriced right
now only about 92 dollars on new egg for
the 3600 speed kit
this one just it's low profile so it
matches up with a lot of coolers granted
I chose an all-in-one for this build so
that doesn't make as much sense but it's
it just it blends in it doesn't stand
out it's all black so there you go and
the memory speed again is the more
important thing I wanted a faster 1
terabyte SSD for our operating system
drive for this build you can still get
these one terabyte drives for like right
around 100 bucks
you can get them for just under $100 but
I wanted one that was actually gonna be
decently fast this isn't the fastest of
the nvme SSDs that are available but it
should give you upwards of 2,000
megabytes per second reads and around
1500 megabytes per second writes and
that is a significant bump up over your
standard SATA SSDs for our graphics card
I went with the RT X 2070 super I chose
the founders Edition because that's the
only one I have confirmed right now it's
only gonna be $500 bear in mind that
there are a lots of already developed
over builds RT X 2070 GPUs that
manufacturers are just gonna take the
existing design for and put it in our on
an RT X 2070 super so there's gonna be a
bunch of these coming out really soon
with third party manufacturer designs
that have you know better built coolers
and everything like that so keep an eye
out for those I just want to point out
that the age of the archie x 2070 nice
cards being 600 bucks should be over
because the base price for the founders
edition is $500 and you really shouldn't
be spending too much more than that so
500 $550 i think is what you should
spend for an RT x 2070 super and yes
that is a price drop if you're comparing
it to what we were seeing with the RT x
2070 originally especially like I said
the fancier versions of the cards that
were more over built and lastly we have
case and power supply just went with the
NZXT th 500 for this one it's only about
$70 this is a very well reviewed case
kind of following a series of
good mid tier cases from NZ XD they
actually have an H 510 that I'm going to
be working with fairly soon that they
just showed off at Computex so that's
kind of exciting and I will go into more
on that once I get to that point but but
about 70 to 80 bucks you can get a
really decent case these days for this
price range you might spend a little bit
more like a hundred but you know this
one did everything I needed it to do it
was only 70 so that's why I went with
that
finally power supply pretty much the
same requirements as I did for the $900
build just bump the wattage up to 750
watts bumped the 80 plus certification
up to gold and then this one is also a
fully modular power supply it's only $80
for the Coolermaster nwe
this is a new series that they've kind
of recently just launched it's a its saw
a power supply and again all black
cabling so once again you guys there's a
lot of stuffs that I can't quite tell
you just yet but just give me a couple
days Sunday probably Sunday and maybe
Monday - I have a few videos I'm working
on because this right here it might be
what you guys are all looking for the
new Rison 3000 series CPUs or maybe this
is an old rising CPU I can't even tell
you that for sure I mean I could but
then AMD would get mad at me or
something guys thank you so much for
watching this video though again the
links to all the parts that shows out
are down in the video's description so
thanks for clicking those and checking
it out if the thumbs up button if you
enjoyed it stay tuned Sunday more videos
coming out with rice and 3000 benchmarks
Navi benchmarks it's gonna be epic
thanks again for watching and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
