Paul episode number 12
that's Baker's no that's not a baker's
dozen next episode will be a baker's
dozen this is my dozens episode this is
a QA video where I answer your questions
that you have asked in the past then the
past was a month ago for probing tall
number 11 listed right here looking back
through the sands of time all the way to
probing Paul number one which is now
just a tiny tiny little image there in
the corner but yeah let's let's just get
started
again all these questions were taken
from the comments from last month's
video and if you guys want to jump to
anything in specific because I'm going
to talk for a little while here I should
have links with the timestamps down
there in the description first question
here
it's from Kramer wolf he says hey Paul
do you and a bit with Kyle or have you
in bit with Kyle ever considered doing a
joint channel I respect both your
opinions and approaches your more
technical while Kyle is more average Joe
gamer IMO but I find both to you both
cover a lot of identical material
wouldn't joining resources save you both
time or would you two just drink too
much you hit on quite a few of the very
relevant points there drinking I mean we
both enjoy a beer here and there I
usually keep my drinking mainly to
Tuesday nights these days but more to
the point Kyle and I work together every
single week we're good friends and we
have a pretty good working relationship
as well which I think both of us pretty
happy with the main reason that we don't
sort of join forces together honestly
directly would be because it's money
because when you have a youtube channel
that generates income via the ads that
are sent then and displayed to people
before you watch the video assuming you
have whitelisted my channel if you're a
good person or if not no big deal but if
we had the same channel then we would
just have one income stream from that
now granted maybe we could get more
views that would kind of even that out
but just since we're both two separate
people we both have two separate
companies we decided to keep things
separated although we do have again that
regular interaction that we do on a live
show every week so we can work we kind
of have a joint joint working
relationship not a joint channel
although Kyle did just recently start a
paid channel which is called bit with
ultra which you
go and sign up for if you're interested
this is his normal channel bit wit and
now he has bit altra and for I think a
buck fifty a month you can sign up and
you can watch all of his videos a week
early including opening fan mail oh I
haven't even watched though actually I
haven't spent I claimed I wasn't gonna
do the free trial and I followed through
with that I haven't done it yet I'm sure
I will soon that's pretty easy to do and
of course I would have to be happy to
support him and his ongoing endeavors
alright next question here is from
Xanadu Carter he's asking I was thinking
about buying an AMD FX 8350 processor
for my gaming rig and was wondering what
motherboard I should buy to go along
with it
no no Xanadu No
don't you don't you don't buy an FX 8350
right now we are literally probably
weeks away I don't know AMD promised
within the first quarter is when then
their architecture and rising CPUs are
going to launch so it's really not
really not a good time at all to invest
in an FX 8350 give yourself a couple
weeks a month at most and you will have
new AMD processors to choose from
they'll be much faster the 8350 it's not
a useless processor by any stretch but
if you're playing more intense games
it's not going to get the same
performance as you would get with a
current generation Intel processor and
definitely it's not going to be on par
with their Zen based stuff because
they've been working on that for like
five to ten years or something like that
and then it's been it's been too long
we've been waiting too long so you
should wait just a little bit longer as
well Jake Connor and a related question
asked do you have Zen CPUs we can't tell
us yes yes I do and now I can't tell you
that means I don't know if that makes
sense
lunchbox asks why the hell do people buy
K CPUs and not overclocked this is the
response to one of the questions that
was asked last month where the gentleman
had purchased a anthalie if it was it
was a 4790k and was not overclocking it
and asked a question about that I this
is a legitimate question though and I
can answer this being someone who has
bought an unlocked processor and not
overclocked it before I remember my i7
920
that I got I did not overclock for a
good five six months after I got it I
did not have the experience back then
that I do now with overclocking and when
you're talking about overclocking and
running something out of spec it can be
a little scary to some people and you're
like oh what happens what if I turn do
that thing that overclocking thing and
turn out my multiplier and then the
computer CPU just burst into flames and
fizzles and then my computer melts into
a block of like aluminum and iron and
another base component materials and
then I don't have a computer anymore and
I mean that's that's probably not going
to happen and but it is understandable
from people who have never overclocked
before the other thing I would say just
as a more legitimate reason might be
because like the same reason that you
buy an SLI or dual graphics card capable
motherboard or set up even though you're
only buying a single graphics card it's
keeping yourself open for future
possibilities and there were also some
responses to this question when I was
looking at it in the comments that also
said the same thing by a processor right
now and if it gets you by and you don't
need to overclock it and it's doing
everything you want it to do and you're
not noticing any lag or anything like
that you can leave it as is for now and
then maybe six months or eight months or
down the road you can upgrade your
cooler and then overclock and get
yourself a bit more performance of that
kind of thing
the main hesitation with overclocking is
if you're going to have to run higher
voltage because if you turn up the
voltage everything else overclocking you
should be fine it might use a little bit
more power but your CPU lifespan isn't
going to be hurt or anything like that
if you do increase the voltage though
that can lead to premature death because
higher voltage can cause issues over
time with CPUs and that's probably as
far as much depth as I should get into
about that for this kind of video 84
decoy 84 asks hey Paul I have a HyperX
cloud 2 headset no matter what I do my
microphone will not work looked at my
microphone on my recording devices so
that the DB is on 0 the slider won't
move I have done a refresh installed
windows updated all my drivers and
received a new headphone domville
microphone boom nothing I've tried has
worked is there something I'm missing or
should I just buy a new headset if I do
buy a new headsets and asking about
Corsair options a headset I think you
have a pretty good headset in the HyperX
cloud 2 gets it's very well reviewed and
if you're not going up into the say 150
to $200 range
or buying say a dedicated headphones and
then using a separate mic or something
like that
HyperX cloud 2 is going to is going to
be a good option I would also point to
my Sennheiser's back here
these aren't available anymore these are
the PC 360 but Sennheiser I think does a
good job with their headsets although
they do tend to be more expensive
usually starting in the upper upper
hundred to two hundred dollar range and
going all the way to $300 plus anyway
more to the point on what I think your
problem might be is a conflict between
your internal sound card and the sound
card that the HyperX cloud 2 headset
might be using so bear in mind there are
two ways to connect the HyperX cloud 2
headset up you can use what it comes
with which is this little dongle right
here and this is a USB device soci USB
plug right there and this is actually a
little sound card a little external
sound card with a separate mic and
headphone input and if you're using that
then you're not going to be using the
sound card that's part of your computer
however you will need to take of course
the plug on the HyperX cloud 2 headset
and plug it into this and you'll
probably also need to use this little
adapter right here so if you look at the
actual plug on the headset
you'll notice it's actually a tip ring
ring sleeve plug so this is 1/8 inch
plug but tipping ring sleeve meaning
that means there's an X another
connection point there and that's
because it is transferring the data not
just for the audio output from your
computer to your ears but also taking
your microphone and outputting it
through that signal as well so if you're
plugging this plug directly into the
back of your computer and not using the
the HyperX module then it's not going to
work unless you use an adapter much like
I believe it comes with now it doesn't
come with that so you would need an
adapter for your motherboard in order to
actually plug that in directly because
you would need the splitter unless this
splitter can plug into both of the
splits on your motherboard but I kind of
doubt that I don't know who knows maybe
maybe it's meant to do that the other
option of course which sounds like you
might be using is using the dongle
itself that USB dongle that it comes
with and if you're using that then you
need to make sure of course that the
drivers are installed from HyperX and
you should be able to download those if
they're not recognized automatically you
might need to do some driver cleaning
if you have driver conflicts in there
something like that but pay attention to
your sound here if you right-click on
the little sound icon in the bottom
right and windows you can pull up all of
your playback devices and your recording
devices so for instance right now I am
using an external device and I also have
sound coming in if you can see your
device but there's no levels here then
you probably probably means that you
have an inline mute button on or
something like that so just pay
attention to these here bear in mind
that you can right-click here until it
to show or not show disabled devices
that they can be hidden sometimes so
double check that and make sure you
don't have something that's hidden and
disabled that you can rename that's the
same thing over here on playback devices
as well you can show or not show those
and of course if you have lots of
different devices connected you might
have lots of different options and bear
in minds that you're probably on your
motherboard have a real tech output and
then if you have your HyperX club 2
device plugged in then you probably also
have a separate device for that so very
much your plug which one your plugged
into and you should be able to switch
back and forth between that and
hopefully get yourself up and running
because that is a good headset and based
on what you're describing does it sound
like you're actually since you've had
the relevant components replaced and RM
aid it doesn't sound like you're dealing
with a faulty product it's probably
something going on with the
configuration with your sound devices ok
next up is Mark Smith who says hey Paul
what kind of wood is your tabletop it
looks super slick like to make something
like it for a new desk well mark you are
in luck because you are also giving me
an opportunity to plug my garage work
logs playlists and I'll link this
playlist down in the description but I
have done quite a few videos about gosh
how many now 14 videos on my garage and
cleaning it up at different times and
that kind of thing the one you're going
to want right here is the new tables
blog where I actually install these they
come from Ikea and and I take you
through the entire process they're made
of birch these ones specifically I
believe right birch yeah
IKEA heme ARP birch 74 inch by three and
then I also use some IKEA legs to go
along with that just to hold them up and
then I have mounted them to the wall as
with some l-brackets and some very
strong screws and it's working great so
far but yeah watch the video you can see
the entire process and the time lapse
and all that good stuff next up is
Gabriele LUMO he says Paul of your
videos often unusual I have a puzzling
question if Ryden and vega fail which
they wouldn't praying so he's praying
that they don't fail I am too Gabriel
what would happen to the CPU and GPU
market that's obviously a bit of
speculation here and I like you and
hoping that they do not fail and I'm not
expecting them to fail either based on
all the early information that's come
come out but let's just say that to
speculate what would happen I think what
would happen is the same thing that's
been happening for the past five years
or so which is Intel releasing new
products that yeah maybe a little bit
faster than the last generation of
products but nothing too mind-blowing
usually in the five to ten percent
performance improvement range we
probably would see prices continue to
creep up remember like the Intel - the
two main mainstream Intel cases used to
cost two hundred bucks and three hundred
bucks now they cost two hundred fifty
bucks and three hundred fifty bucks or
even more than that and you yeah you
probably see Intel just kind of continue
to we're going to plot along at a
relatively reasonable pace here and not
do a whole lot new if Vega fails I'm not
sure I do feel like NVIDIA has has
pushed the envelope and I think on the
Radeon side they've been providing more
competition with NVIDIA as compared to
the the CPU side as from AMD providing
competition to Intel so yeah
GPU market probably you would just see
Nvidia be like oh cool we don't need to
lower our prices on anything and we can
keep the prices as is and maybe like
maybe push back some of the launches for
other stuff like we need this
competition in order to keep Intel and
NVIDIA on their toes to keep them
pushing forward and to make sure that
they're not just sort of sitting back on
their IP and waiting for something to
happen before the like alright now we
can now we can release this thing that
we've had for a year or two but we
haven't given to people because it would
compete with our existing products that
are already out there and cost less for
us to make that kind of thing
lots goes into the considerations when
you're talking about computer sales and
an entire marketplace and everything but
that's that's what I think would happen
and Chris clay asks hey Paul of your
contents I haven't got a clear answer
but it is e 270 board better at
overclocking at a 6700 K then a z170
recently got a really good deal at 6700
K and I'm rebuilding my rig so the
simple answer to your question Chris is
no AZ 270 board is not inherently better
at overclocking than a z170 board what
can make a difference is the power
delivery on the board and typically if
you're buying a budget or entry-level
z170 or Z 270 board say the ones that
cost you know 90 to 120 dollars that's
usually the first place where they skimp
on the hardware that's integrated onto
the motherboard it's going to be the
power delivery you'll either have fewer
power phases or you will have a lack of
cooling on them and that can actually
limit your overclocking potential or
limit your overclocking stability at
higher overclocks
I definitely have had my share of z170
boards that didn't overclock as well
whereas a higher-end z170 board did
overclock a little bit better but
there's nothing in the chipset itself
that makes Z 270 better or Zed 270 if
you feel like accusing Zed instead of Z
throw that out there but yeah I would
say just look for a board that's
reasonably good overclocking you're
pregnant you need to spend about a
hundred fifty to two hundred dollars for
something like that although there are
some reasonable ones that lower-end look
at product reviews see what people have
done with overclocking with a specific
board that you're looking at and what
they've gotten out of it stable the main
benefit of Z 270 is going to be you have
a little bit more compatibility for m2
devices so you can have more m dot two
slots for high-speed SSDs o an OP tain
support if you're at all interested in
octane you do need Z 270 and KB Lake at
least for the time being until another
your platform launches from Intel which
which might happen in the future at some
point
last thing to point out here this is
just my p o-- box if you guys are
interested in sending me anything we
usually do unboxing of these things on
the live stream but that's my p o-- box
address for three to five dan bar
california if you want to send me
started out there I don't have it listed
in descriptions or anything so it's the
only way that you can find that but guys
thank you so much for watching this
