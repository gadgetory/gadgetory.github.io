link in the video's description what's
up guys how's it going welcome back to
Pauls hardware today's video is gonna be
kind of a play it by ear video where I'm
going to test some big questions about
the new RT X 2070 graphics cards these
just launched like yesterday as of the
filming of this video and they're
available for sale today as of the
filming of this video and if you watched
my intro video where I ran benchmarks on
these cards you may have noticed that
there are two different prices there is
a $500 price which is supposed to be how
much the cheapest r-tx 27t cost and that
is going to ship at a frequency that is
sort of set and regulated by Nvidia and
they can't ship it higher frequencies
than that but you can of course get
manufacturer overclocked versions of the
card this is the msi armor 2070 RTX 2070
by the way this is the gaming Z r-tx
2070 so this is a $600 version this is a
$500 version the big question is what is
the actual difference between the GPUs
themselves and can you overclock a $500
version to get yourself pretty much the
same performance as you can get with the
$600 version because for 500 bucks yes
the r-tx 2070 is an expensive graphics
card but you can kind of make a case for
it when you compare it to like the GTX
1080 and other cards that cost around
$500 for 600 bucks though it just
becomes like way too overpriced so today
we're going to answer two questions can
you overclock a $500 RTX 2070 to give
you the same performance as a $600 r-tx
2070 and then hopefully also since these
are supposed to be available for sale
today can you actually buy a $500 RTX
2070 are they still going to be in stock
today or are they just gonna be products
that you know there's a few of but they
sell out immediately and everyone will
be stuck spending 580 or $600 on a more
expensive one I've reached out to some
of our manufacturer partners to get
their feedback on this but for starters
I think we should actually disassemble
both of these cards to get a closer look
at the Jeep
you itself
here's our two GPUs the gaming Z the
$600 version on the right the armor or
the $500 version on the left there are
of course some immediate differences
between the two that you can see like
for instance the armor has a base plate
that goes down most of the board
includes some cooling for some of the
components down at this end whereas the
gaming Z's actually stops over here but
the contact plate for the cooler side
itself actually extends out here and
makes contact with some of those and
it's also just a beefier one you can
tell just by holding it there's a lot
more fins in there so it's got more
thermal mass to absorb heat and
dissipate it's also got a six pipe array
over here with a couple thicker it looks
like six millimeter and eight millimeter
pipes whereas this one here is using a
five pipe array with looks like all six
millimeter pipes it does have the direct
copper contact though with the actual
GPU the circuit board design for these
is actually based on the same layout so
you can kind of notice because it's a
little taller here but it has a cutout
for the PCI Express graphics power
connectors here still going with an
eight pin and a six pin but the power
delivery elements themselves is a full
array here we have an eight phase--
power delivery setup here versus the six
phase over on this one and you can
actually see the blank space here where
there would be some chokes and some
capacitors MOSFETs are under this plate
right here as compared to the fully
kitted out bank of VRMs on the gaming Z
but this was actually my main point the
main reason I tore these down was to
actually look at the GPU dye itself
which I've wiped off as best I can
and you can see the actual SKU tu 106 is
the GPU dye that the r-tx 27 TS are
based on but as you can see there is a
slight variance here tu 106 - 408 - a 1
for the $600 version whereas the $500
version here is tu 106 - 400 - a 1 so
not 400 a - a 1 just - 400
so this quick teardown confirms what I
kind of already knew and that is that
there is actually a different GPU or a
slight variation of the T 106 GPU used
in the $500 ins of the cards versus the
$600 versions of the cards so the next
thing I'm going to do and this is going
to be a somewhat limited test again
because I only have two cards to test
against each other I'm hoping some other
people will also maybe do a similar test
like this is to see if I try to manually
overclock this
lower-end version the $500 version here
can I achieve the same overclocks that
this version ships with can I save
myself a hundred bucks by doing some
manual overclocks with this the
manufacturers with this version of the
GPU that ships and the 500 divergence
are specifically limited by Nvidia are
specifically restricted by Nvidia from
shipping this at a higher frequency does
that mean that the chips themselves
aren't capable of reaching those
frequencies or is it just something that
NVIDIA has put out there so that they
can differentiate these products and
sell them at two different prices even
though the potential performance is the
same between them also I have at least
one follow up from a manufacturer so far
EVGA has confirmed that yes they have a
$500 version it's available directly on
the EVGA website it's available for sale
right now and I'm also asking if they
expect availability to continue through
the holidays and they said yes they
think it should that's a little
forward-looking so we can't verify that
of course until time goes by and we see
if they stay in stock but at least for
now
I'll post links in the video's
description to $500 versions of the r-tx
27 TS wherever I find them available
alright guys so the I got my test bed
loaded back up using pretty much the
same settings and everything that I was
using yesterday I did load up MSI
Afterburner to use that for overclocking
and really the only difference here when
it comes to the shipping frequency of
the graphics cards is gonna be the base
in the boosts clock so by defaults the
base clock is 1410 and the boost clock
is 1624 this $500 version in my testing
yesterday the base clock of the $600
version was still 1410 but the boost was
eighteen thirty two hundred and ten
points higher so literally all I'm going
to do to try to save us hundred dollars
here is just add two hundred and ten
points to our our core clock hit apply
there and then the boost clock here in
just a moment should reflect eighteen
thirty which is the boost clock of the
six hundred dollar version and now we
can test and see if it was effective I'm
just gonna run time spy
damn it Jim ruined everything's ruined
alright final test is finishing up here
and our GPU score of 93 31 is the score
to beat
that's what we gots with the original
test yesterday and look at that we're
not at 93 31 we're ninety-one for 64 but
that still is a huge jump up the
graphics score that stock was 83 92 so
we went from 83 92 to 91 64 we're still
just slightly shy of the gaming Z's its
graphics score of 93 31 but we've come
much much closer to it and again hundred
bucks less and you saw what I did I
punched in plus two hundred and ten and
that's what I got I also want to point
out temperature and this wasn't a long
stress test or anything but we only got
up to 66 degrees so that's not even a
higher temperature than I saw in my
overall testing running through a full
suite of benchmarks when I initially
rolled this out but I want to run one
more test here and all I'm really gonna
do here just to see if we can bump that
score up even just a little bit more is
in addition to the plus 210 on the core
clock I'm also going to take the power
limit slider and max that out max on
this card is 114 percent or adding 14%
more so I'm just gonna hit apply there
and then we'll run the test one more
time so here is another result from our
test and that is that with the power
limit max we actually froze up and
somehow it's now telling me this is a
valid score my valid score of zero all
right so here we can see that our
frequency as it's running along is about
the same frequency that we were hitting
with the gaming Zed which is about 1950
megahertz on average let's analyze this
run our GPU core clock actually got up
to 27 T which is actually a higher max
frequency than the gaming Z hits out of
the box and we can sort of see as this
chart as it's slowly disappearing we
were hitting around 1950 megahertz
1950 1970 1965 1935 so it was also
hitting around the same frequency
temperature was also within range we
only hit a 68 degrees Celsius max just
something about that power limit it
didn't like and threw an error and
caused the test to fail so I'm gonna do
one more test here just gonna drop from
114 to 110 on the power limit and see if
that will introduce a little bit of
stability and see what we come out with
our benchmark test so we had a crash
once again so this is this is kind of
worrying to me a little bit at least in
that this GPU doesn't seem to be
accepting more power additional power
limit which is going to increase the
temperatures also allow it to increase
power consumption like for instance max
power consumption is 112 point nine
percent of its rated TDP so this
introduces some questions and
unfortunately they're questions that I
cannot directly answer because again
I've only got one card to test so
anything I'm gonna say here it's gonna
be somewhat anecdotal related to this
card so what this indicates to me is
that well obviously the GPU isn't able
to run through the tests successfully
with the frequency it's running at right
now I don't think it's a temperature
issue and it might potentially be an
issue with the power delivery to the GPU
itself or just the GPU ASIC quality
itself which would indicate that it's
good that I'm doing this video because
that might seem to indicate that the tu
106 400 a dies can potentially overclock
a little bit better I can't say that
with too much certainty because I've
only tested two cards against each other
but perhaps others who have these cards
will come out and do some similar
testings so we can get a more accurate
picture of what we should expect when it
comes to the 2070 but more to the point
and again just to see if we can get $600
performance out of a $500 card I'm doing
one more modification here to my
overclock trying to keep things simple
still but power limits at 110 core clock
is at plus 210 to give us the same core
clock as a 600
version I've set the fan speed to 60%
which you can hear just a little bit but
it's not terribly loud we'll see if that
helps such and gets us a clean it run
through time spy at so these settings
did allow us to improve our score again
a little bit more 92 94 for the graphics
score and again that's compared to 93 31
so we're getting within about 40 points
which is honestly pretty much negligible
when it comes to tests like these I was
I think a little disappointed that we
saw instability at such a relatively low
overclock again with just the power
slider max which is just plus 14% on
that and then with the overclock which
is clearly an overclock that MSI is
comfortable shipping a slightly more
overbuilt card at I wasn't expecting to
actually have the test crash at the
point that they did but with just a
little bit of coercing and mainly just
increasing the fan speed which can often
get you better performance just by
keeping the GPUs temperature down which
allows it to run at a higher frequency I
was able to get myself a little bit
better score and again save that hundred
dollars by just loading up afterburner
and doing just a couple quick tweaks so
that's the only thing left to do is
double check and see if NVIDIA has made
fools of all of us for viewers by
telling us that they would have $500 RTX
27 TS available at launch I want to
double check that now that it is launch
day but we also have to somewhat be
mindful of the fact that it is launch
day so initial launch numbers as far as
what they have in stock might be
refreshed soon so I'm not immediately
saying that if it's sold out that Nvidia
has screwed us all over and I do have at
least one response from EVGA when it
comes to expected availability but there
appear to be four variants of the $500
card that includes the EVGA r-tx 2070
black edition the Asus turbo which is a
blower style design the gigabytes are
chi-x 2070 DirectX 12 which is a three
fan blower style design as well and then
of course the msi armor which is the one
that i've been testing here also
available for $500 now there are
variants like for instance you can get
an overclock manufacturer overclocked
version of the armor for 50 bucks more
550 is what it's selling for on Newegg
if you go over to Amazon
it's 570 dollars but honestly guys do
what I did here get that $500 version
and just overclock it unless more people
do further testing and determined that
yes these $500 versions actually aren't
that good at overclocking but you can at
least be relatively assured I think that
you can hit the same frequencies that
the $600 versions are shipping at EVGA
is $500 version is listed on Amazon but
it says it's temporarily out of stock
that is also the case for a Seuss's
turbo version which for some reason is
5:30 here this is what we don't want to
see is creeping up prices for these
supposed $500 versions of the cards
gigabytes is also here also temporarily
out of stock and then the MSI is again
that's the manufacturer overclocked
version this one should also have the
non overclocked version for 500 bucks
EVGA though is like I said is the only
one who has responded to me in all
fairness I've only given them about two
hours to get back to me so I might get
further follow-ups later today which
I'll probably maybe post in the comment
section down below if I get word from
that but they said they expect these to
continue to be available through the
holiday season and you can buy directly
from EVGA right now it's on pre-order
status and it's expected to ship within
two to three weeks
so again initial availability might not
be completely ubiquitous but it does
seem like within a couple weeks these
will be shipping out and people who want
cards and are only willing to spend 500
bucks can get them all right guys that
is pretty much gonna wrap it up for this
video again just wanted to answer those
basic questions about this r-tx 2017
launch since the stuff that we weren't
necessarily able to share since the
cards hadn't launched yet like they have
now today or probably yesterday is when
this video actually goes up so I'll post
links where relevant to hopefully the
$500 versions of these cards at least
available for pre-order or backorder or
ship in a couple weeks order and this is
something that I'm gonna try to keep an
eye on in the coming weeks and
especially leading up to like November
and Black Friday time as people or may
be interested in buying these cards for
Christmas presents or something like
that and keeping Nvidia honest as much
as we can in telling us that the cards
will be available for a certain price
and then those cards never actually
being available for the price this has
me somewhat optimistic that you will
still be able to buy a $500
RTX 2070 EVGA s response as well thank
you vga for getting back to me on that
one and of course if you are buying the
$500 version
pretty simple to download the
overclocking software punch in the
numbers for the higher-end version
overclock it yourself and save the
little cache there thank you guys so
much for watching this video though
links again to relevant stuff is down in
the description hit the thumbs up button
if you enjoyed it and I will be back
very soon because if you didn't notice
there's an another test fed in the
background here that I'm supposed to be
also working on at the same time it's
got the 9900 K in it which launches very
soon so stay tuned for that too
subscribed and all that good stuff and
we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
