SK 630 and SK 650 what's up guys how's
it going and welcome to my builds video
for March 2019 this is a monthly series
aimed at helping you guys pick out the
appropriate parts to build a computer
for yourself I'm not going to be
building the system's today so if you
are interested in me putting some
systems together check out my builds
playlist which is linked down in the
video's description today I'm going to
be going over parts lists so if you have
a vague idea of how much money you want
to spend but you don't know the exact
parts that you should buy in order to
put a system together well that's what
this video is all about also if you
missed it last month or just in the past
few weeks I did a refreshed how to build
a PC video series for beginners it's a
three part series so feel free to check
that out as well if you're looking to
get started in building a computer
especially if you're building a gaming
PC these builds are based on your
feedback from last month so also check
the description for a strawpoll link
these were your responses for March so
we're gonna do balanced builds around
this gtx 1660 TI today i'll side a bunch
of other options on there so for next
month if you want to vote on april check
the video description for this straw
poll and i took a bunch of these sort of
mid-range responses the responses that
weren't at the top but not at the bottom
and refresh them for this month and i
added one or two more so feel free to
vote on those let's get started though
with this month's first build which is
about an eight hundred and ten dollar
gaming pc and once again these first two
builds are all based around the 1660 tee
I just recently launched from Nvidia
which costs about two hundred and eighty
dollars if you get the entry-level one
which is a very good price relative to
the prices that Nvidia has been
launching over the past six months for
their new stuff so you can finally get
our Turing GPU for 280 bucks it's a good
price to performance for this card so
I've decided to integrate this into an
AMD build and an Intel build the AMD
build is actually very very similar to
the build I did last month just with the
few parts so up
here and there so I'm gonna go through
it pretty quickly I'm still basing this
on the rise in 526 hundred because I
just think it's still the best bang for
your buck six cores and twelve threads
unlocked for overclocking one hundred
and sixty-five dollars I've paired that
up with the hyper 2/12 Black Edition
because it's on a crazy deal for twenty
two dollars on new egg several of the
parts in this build our reliance on mail
and rebates so bear that in mind no egg
has several going on right now for a
total savings of about fifty five
dollars but other than that we've got
the ever-popular MSI B 450 tomahawk
motherboard a 16 gig memory kit for $80
oh that's fabulous
a 53 dollar 480 gig SSD the 16 60 TI of
course and then a case and power supply
coming in for about $100 for the pair so
here's the Rison v 2600 and as an
all-around cpu I think you can't get
better than this right now it's a
hundred and sixty-five dollars on Newegg
you get Tom Clancy's the division 2 game
as well which you know that that's not
bad it does come with a relatively small
cooler though this is the Wraith stealth
rather than the race spire so for that
reason I've paired it up with this
cooler the hyper 212 Black Edition which
combines the price to performance of the
hyper 212 with some good aesthetic
features because it's all black at a $10
million rebate card at Newegg you can
get it for $22 and it's just gonna be a
great cooler for you and it's gonna
perform much better than that Wraith
stealth which will allow you to
overclock if you want or just allow the
processor itself to run at a higher
frequency because the 2600 has what's
called xf r or extender frequency range
from AMD so it'll automatically
overclock itself a little bit if you
give it the thermal Headroom the
motherboard again is the B 450 Tom Hawk
I've used this with a few different
builds now for about $100 or a little
over $100 we're just looking for basic
functionality so we want 4 memory slots
so we have memory expansion capabilities
we want at least one MDOT 2 slot which
it also has and then this board also has
pretty good power delivery for a little
over $100 motherboard so it's going to
be able to support some overclocks if
you want to go that route or support the
higher-end CPUs on this platform like
the 8 core and 16 thread options that
are available if I have a complaint
about the msi arsenal tomahawk it's that
the price has gone up it used to be
about a hundred five dollars now it's
more like a hundred and ten two hundred
and twenty depending where you look I
think it's due to the popularity that
the price has crept up a little bit but
still a good board next up is memory and
I'm just
using the pc part picker filter here to
show you guys how i have been searching
for memory basically especially for
risin I'm looking at 3000 3200 you know
I'll include speeds up to maybe 3600
just to see if there's any good deals on
faster speeds and then we just want a 16
gig kit 2 by 8 gigs and then we just
want to sort by price you can also start
by price per gigabyte but it should be
about the same and here we can see
direct evidence of memory prices coming
down in q1 which is absolutely awesome
so $80 for this g.skill aegis kit that
does work with Rhys and processors it's
just a screaming deal you could spend a
few more dollars here and look for a kit
that's maybe 3200 speed or something
like that but you're gonna have to spend
$20 plus more to jump up to that level
so that's why I stuck with this ddr4
3000 speed kit again it's low profile
it's Aegis it doesn't have much in the
way of heat sinks but it will get the
job done and again it works with Rison
for storage we have a 500 gig class SSD
that means 480 to 512 gigs as far as the
capacity goes and you should be able to
find that for around $50 this is an 82
su 6 55 for 53 bucks we're gonna go with
that and move on for our graphics card
we actually have a bunch of options down
here for the 1660 Ti this is another
example of why I think this card is
pretty viable for people you can
actually buy it for the stated price
that Nvidia said they would sell it for
even 5 bucks less we've got this EVGA XC
black version actually went with these
otech 16 68 TI gaming video cards simply
because it's got a little bit larger
cooler it's got a dual fan cooling
solution on there honestly most of these
16 60 TI's are going to perform within a
percentage point or two of each other so
don't worry too much about that just
keep an eye out for deals because these
have been going on sale for 5 bucks 10
bucks or 20 bucks off for a case we have
the corsair carbide spec oh six ATX and
this one usually goes for 75 or 80 bucks
but Newegg again how they deal right now
$20 rebate card so you can get it for
$55 the original spec oh five version of
this case that wasn't a huge fan of
aesthetically but this case has received
a lot of positive feedback just for
being a good functional case it has 220
millimeter fans included so you got your
airflow it's got a power supply basement
at the bottom makes painted interior and
a good layout for installing your
hardware especially at the back here
when it comes to cable management and
support for mounting some 2.5
justice DS rounding things out with a
power supply when you're looking for a
power supply you're gonna want 550 watt
to 650 watt for a standard gaming PC and
you just want to look for these basic
things having a brand that you recognize
Corsair see sonic EVGA are all good
options having all black cabling like
the CX 550 is also a good choice and
then I recommend 80 plus bronze rated at
least if you can find 80 plus gold rated
then that is going to be a little bit
better but this one also has a $15
million rebate taking it from about $54
down to about $39 so that is how we are
getting this entire system in at a price
of just over $800 808 82 according to PC
part picker and if you compare that to
last month's $900 build most of the
savings are coming from about a $80
savings with the graphics card going
from an RT X 2060 to the GTX 60 and 60
Ti and then there's another $20 in
savings or so from the memory also
coming down in price but I think this
would be a very solid performer but what
if you were like Paul why don't you ever
do an Intel build at this price well I
have done that and that is my second
build which is also an $800 build
actually comes in a few bucks cheaper at
$800 and 82 cents and all I have done
with this build is swapped out the CPU
and the motherboard because everything
else can stay exactly the same it's a
standard sized ATX build we can use the
same power supply case graphics card
storage memory we just need an updated
motherboard to support the Intel socket
LGA 1151 and we can even keep the same
cooler with the cooler master hyper 212
black so for this build I'm just gonna
concentrate on what is different and
first off what is available when it
comes to trying to find a CPU on the
Intel side that competes with that $165
2600 so all I'm looking at here our
Intel LGA 1151 CPUs that are between 151
and 218 dollars here and note to the
core count listing right here we have
two cores we have four cores six cores
with the i-5 90 400 F and the cheapest
you can get that is 175 dollars this is
the CPU that I chose but I'm gonna come
back to in just a second if we keep
going down the list we see dual cores
quad-core there's another six core in
the i-5 8400 but that's about 25 dollars
more
than the 9400 f so I increase the
top-end price here just to see what we
would need to pay in order to get a six
core unlocked for overclocking CPU from
Intel and for that we'd have to go up to
the eighty six hundred K which costs to
it in $60 and that's about ninety five
dollars more than you would pay for the
r5 2600 and when you just pay for six
cores on the intel side you also are not
getting an unlocked processor so here's
the ninety four hundred F the F on the
end means it doesn't have integrated
graphics so that kind of sucks but since
we are adding a graphics card to this
bill with a 16 16 TI we don't need those
integrated graphics and because of that
Intel feels okay selling it for the
price of one hundred and seventy five
dollars the CPU will run at a max turbo
frequency of 4.1 gigahertz according to
some of the comments I've read about it
it's gonna run at about 3.9 or 4
gigahertz on all cores when it's
actually under load and it's only got a
65 watt TDP so you're not gonna have any
issue running this processor at it's
rated speeds even with a less expensive
motherboard and I suppose the silver
lining to this CPU being locked and not
able to be overclocked is that you don't
have to spend the money on an unlocked
for overclocking motherboards so for
that reason we got the asrock be 365 Pro
4 here available for about 90 to $100
and again this motherboard is gonna have
all those basic features that you wants
when it comes to memory slots and
expandability not a high-end motherboard
but it does have two m dot two slots and
that will allow you to put this entire
system together for the low low price of
around eight hundred dollars but it's
not unlocked for overclocking you cannot
add and unlocked for overclocking CPU to
this system and then overclock it
because of the motherboard the ears
stuck with so when it comes to an
upgrade path for the CPU in this build
you'd be pretty limited you'd basically
we want to stick with existing locked
CPUs from Intel that would offer more
cores or more threads and there's not a
whole lot of those maybe like than 8700
which gives you six cores and twelve
threads beyond that you have like a 9700
K and a 9900 K but those are much more
expensive CPUs and they're unlocked for
overclocking which wouldn't be a
sensible pairing for the motherboard
that you buy for the system so again
that upgrade path magic that you get on
the AMD side doesn't exist here that
isn't to say this system shouldn't be
built it's just for somebody who is
interested in overclocking isn't
interested in upgrading their CPU down
the line and you probably be more
focused on just the single core
performance of the CPU which means
you're probably focused on gaming
strictly I have one more build to run
down for you guys this is a $2,000
system it is a mini ITX PC it is again
Intel based so for anyone who's like
Paul what would you recommend for an
Intel system this right here but it's a
bit more of a nitch system a bit more
specialized and so for that reason we
have a total price of well about one
thousand nine hundred and thirty-five
dollars and the core components here are
gonna be the i7 8700 K for the CPU as
well as the G I'm sorry the RT x 2070
for the GPU and then of course the case
that I'm building in which is right here
the century 2.0 from doctors a bird
which is a new case which is launching
later in March they sent me this
engineering sample to do it build with
so that's what I'm gonna do although
this case is on the more expensive side
they're listing a MSRP of 230 euros for
this which is about $250 US but it is
one of these smallest cases that you can
build in and I'm kind of interested to
see what changes they've made from the
century 1.0 to the 2.0 1.0 was
originally a Kickstarter and they've
done a bunch of cool stuff to upgrade
the second version based on a lot of
feedback they've gotten from people like
you guys in the first version let's run
down the parts here you've got the i7
8700 K in my opinion right now the best
bang for your buck when you're looking
at intel side because it's unlocked you
get six cores and twelve threads it's
less money than the 9700 k and you get
more threads and basically when it comes
to per core performance if you're
running this at the same frequency that
you're running a 9700 k it it's gonna be
the same gaming performance Intel unlock
CPUs do not come with a cooler and I
wanted 120-millimeter all-in-one to fit
in this case because the case supports
120 millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler
for your CPU as long as you use a
shorter graphics card so I have the
Corsair h-60 here which I sure hope fits
the main requirements here are we need a
reasonably slim radiator for the hundred
twenty millimeter cooler and then just a
single fan it's gonna go on top of that
so I'm pretty confident this will fit in
the case for a motherboard we've got the
asus rog strict c through ninety - i
gaming mini ITX motherboard which I
happen to have which was a part of the
reason I chose it
it's also a high-end z3 90 motherboard
that can actually overclock even though
it's still Mini ITX it's got a nice
assortment of i/o on the back including
integrated Wi-Fi and a fixed IO shield
it is on the pricier side though coming
in at around a hundred and ninety to
two-hundred dollars so yes you could get
a lot more performance building a
full-size ATX system and not being
saddled with this many of the
requirements I am with this case I just
can point that out because I'm sure
people will mention it in the comments
anyway for memory I've just got a
Corsair Vengeance lpx kit 3200 speeds so
it's gonna be fast and it's low-profile
and there's no side panel viewing window
in the system or anything so all black
is just fine I had an interesting
experience when it came to choosing an
SSD my initial plan was to go with about
a 1 terabyte MDOT to nvme SSD for the
main operating system and everything and
then for a secondary drive I was just
gonna find a SATA SSD like this a 2
terabyte 2.5 inch drive that would give
you a one terabyte nvme for your
operating system and a lot of stuff and
then two more terabytes of SSD storage
giving you three terabytes total and
then I went on PC part picker and I went
to looked at SSDs and the capacities
between one and two terabytes and sorted
by price per gigabyte and guess what
appears at the top the Intel 660 P
series both the two terabyte and the one
terabyte in fact the two terabyte Intel
660 P right now is the best price per
gigabyte actually 11 cents per gigabyte
that's beating out a lot of SATA SSDs
and when it comes to the Intel 660 P
with this isn't the 660 I just wanted to
hold something in my hand it will
sometimes get some criticism because it
uses key qlc memory which is four bits
per cell when it comes to the actual
NAND flash that's on the drive that can
affect its write speed so if you're
doing a long sustained writes to the
drive it can slow down however it's
still much faster than any standard SATA
Drive so as a result my storage
configuration for this build is a 1
terabyte Intel 660 P and a 2 terabyte
until 660 P and fortunately my
motherboard has 2 m dot 2 slots it's got
one on the front and one on the back so
I can use both of them at the same time
and I just think that's so funny like I
spent extra time on this thinking like
no like is is that really practical and
yeah for the price right now
it is the most practical and the 660 P
makes a great operating system drive
because response speed and read speeds
are still really good on it
a real quick here's a look at the dr.
Xavier website which I just think it's
funny because they like hey we have
these massive industrial machines that
we make or you know we do some work with
wind turbines or we've got this little
mini ITX PC which I just think is
awesome but you can find a link in the
description if you want to check out the
actual product page for this they have
manuals for the earlier version and a
newer version you can also subscribe if
you want to get an email when the
century 2.0 will be available if you've
got the scratch it is on the more
expensive side but very very compact
it's like a 7 liter size they've
maintained the same size from the
century 1.0 but when it comes to the
internal layout you'll find with a 7
liter case you know things can get a
little cramped in there so we're gonna
do an SFX power supply and 120
millimeter liquid cooler that goes down
there which means our graphics card
needs to be 170 millimeters now I'm not
100% sure right now when it comes to the
PCI Express power plugs if we're gonna
have compatibility on this because
doctors aber currently isn't listening
compatibility for RTX cards they have a
bunch of compatibility listed for a 10
series as well as existing AMD cards but
this is one of those cases where
especially if you're putting a
all-in-one liquid cooler radiator down
here the length of the card very much
does matter so for that reason I wanted
the highest end graphics card that could
fit in there I was looking for many ITX
r-tx 2080s those don't seem to exist at
this time maybe they will in the future
in which case I would totally swap out
for one of those but for $500 you can
get the gigabyte geforce r-tx 2070 which
is super small 170 millimeters in length
actually 160 9.9 is what they list
so obviously this card isn't gonna stay
as cool some of the bigger
RTX 27 TS with more massive coolers but
you're not going to be able to fit those
in a case that is as small as the
century' 2.0 rounding things out we need
a sfx power supply the corsair SF 600 is
a great one because it's fully modular
it's all black so it's gonna blend in
nicely aesthetic aesthetics wise and
then of course it's got all black
modular cables too so another product
that i've used before that I'm very
confident will work just fine in this
build so I
building this system later this month
let me know in the comments section if
you have any feedback on that or
suggestions for me and also let me know
what you think of the builds I've put
together for this month but guys that's
gonna wrap it up for this video thank
you so much for watching my March 2019
