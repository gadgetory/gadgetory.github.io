they are and what they do and how to
choose between them should you for
instance consider this MSI be 150 a
gaming Chrome on the board which uses
the be 150 chipset as a home for your
new skylake CPU or what a z170
motherboard that uses z170 chipset like
this z170a gaming m7 be a better fit
hi I am just itching to find out
excellent I was going to show you guys
500 cool features of the fractal core
500 ITX case but that would take way too
long so here are five its compact and
sleep with a brushed front panel it has
surprisingly good water flowing support
it has big magnetic dust filters it
supports full sized ATX power supplies
and it has room for 170 millimeter tall
CPU coolers click the sponsor link in
the description for more information
if you've ever picked out parts for a PC
in the past you may have paused upon
consideration of the motherboard after
all when you're finding a motherboard
for your build there's not just CPU
socket compatibility to worry about
there's picking the right form factor to
fit your case whether it's ATX like this
one Mini ITX or micro ATX and then
you've got a pour-over all of the
options within those parameters which
can be pretty extensive of course you
must ensure that it's got a bangin
design and color scheme to match your
sweet new graphics card and even beyond
all that there's the huge daunting list
of bandwidth numbers specs and port
offerings that tends to be the most
confusing part many of the things on
that list are determined by what chipset
your motherboard uses so to help
understand what the chipset controls on
the motherboard let's take a look at a
lovely block diagram so this here is the
generic 100 series chipset block diagram
that Intel provides specifically in this
case talk about the z170 chipset
prepared with an i7 6700 K processor so
up on top you can see the processor of
course and then that connects up
directly to for example the memory here
on the top right ddr4 ddr3l depending on
what the case may be it's a dual channel
so you have two lines going over there
also on the top left you'll notice PCI
Express connection directly to the CPU
and there's different configurations you
can do with that depending on what you
have plugged into it below the CPU you
will notice a connection in this case D
i 3.0 are direct media interface which
connects to the chipset and then the
chipset is where everything else
connects up so you can see all the stuff
branching off of that so that includes
for example up to 20 PCI Express gen3
lanes those are grouped in clusters of
four and those can be used to connect up
m dot two ports for high speed SSDs for
example also you've got USB 2.0 and 3.0
that are available again up to ten USB
3.0 up to 14 USB 2.0 these numbers all
vary depending on what is connected
because there's a there's a limit to the
total available bandwidth but that's why
it kind of varies a little bit from
motherboard to motherboard for example
you also have some other stuff down here
like an integrated land some extra Intel
features like management engine extreme
tuning utility I'm not going to really
go into those too much just to say
sometimes they're there sometimes
they're not and look them up individual
if you want to see what they do over on
the right you'll notice Intel Rapid
Storage technology for PCI Express
storage that will allow you to set up
raid configurations and that's not
available on all the chipsets also you
have your SATA ports six is the standard
SATA rev3 six gigabit per second ports
and also Intel HD audio bear in mind
again that this is the z170 chipset that
we're talking about here and this is the
top of the line of hundred series
chipsets from Intel so you can imagine
that all of the other chipsets
derivative of this are going to have
some arrangement of these features but
they're going to have a reduced quantity
or reduce speed in certain areas let's
take a look at an AMD motherboard before
we move on though here is a socket am3+
motherboard from AMD that is their CPU
side that's not APU so you got a CPU and
these all require discrete graphics
cards but this is a GA 990 FX Aug 7
motherboard from gigabytes and it uses a
990 FX chipset you can actually see the
motherboard on the left and then the
block diagram on the right so there's a
990 FX and then there's also an AMD SB
950 said down below that yes kids
AMD's mainstream am3+ motherboards have
a north bridge and a south bridge -
chipset that is like two chipsets for
the price of one this actually used to
be the norm
for all motherboards until more and more
stuff from the chipsets was moved into
the CPU so here you can see for example
the CPU up at the top does not directly
control your PCI Express Lanes those are
controlled via the 990 FX Northbridge so
this means that the choice of
Northbridge on AMD side can affect how
much pci express connectivity you have
so that's something to look into
when AMD a.m. for platform and for
platform comes out in 2016
they're going to be going to a single
chipset design which is the same thing
that AMD FM 2 platform uses and intel's
platforms that we're talking about today
use so the Northbridge and Southbridge
chipset configuration will finally be a
thing of the past that old computer
builders reminisce about it's very
nostalgic here's one more block diagram
to look at I know they're incredibly
sexy but I actually feel like they do a
great job of sort of giving a visual of
how everything's connected so this is an
actual motherboard that you can buy this
is again a gigabyte motherboard because
they're very consistent was providing
the block diagrams this is the GA one
z170 X gaming 7 so you can see the CPU
up at the top PCIe lanes are connected
over here on the left side via a switch
that determines again whenever whenever
one is plugged into the other you get a
single by 16 or 2 by 8 lanes and then
also the memory over here and then you
can see some more specific connections
for like display connectors for the eye
GPU the z170 chipset down here below has
just an absolute crap ton of stuff
coming off of it so that includes all of
your SATA SATA Express MDOT two socket
three up here on the top right a USB 3.0
hub that they've entered to give you
additional USB ports although that is a
hub not an additional controller a USB
3.1 controller from Intel to give you
your type-c and your USB 3.1 here also
your USB 3.0 and 2.0 connectors dual
BIOS you've got your sound coming off
here in the lower left and then you've
got like for instance those little tiny
PCIe slots those come off of the chipset
not directly from the CPU so there's
your by one slots and then you've got a
switch here for your m2 socket 3 as well
as a PCI Express
by 4:00 in this little area and this is
kind of something to keep an eye out for
as you're looking at stuff is because
this is a switch that means if use one
and not you you can all use one or the
other so that any again just something
to kind of keep an eye out for and then
motherboard manufacturers also have the
ability to add stuff on that might not
exist natively as part of the chipset
but they can use the PCIe lanes coming
off of it to connect them up so you've
got like an AZ media chip over here that
gives you a couple more six 806 ports
you've got a a killer a 2400 LAN port
here and then an Intel Gigabit Ethernet
LAN that they've added as well so the
main reason to get a chipset with a Z or
an X on the front like X 99 or Z 170 and
we're talking about the Intel side here
is because it unlocks overclocking for
corresponding CPUs with a K or an X on
the end like the 6600 K or the 5960 X I
don't think I can overemphasize how
strongly I feel that if you get an
overclocked Abel CPU with a K or an X
you should get a motherboard that
enables overclocking like a z170 if
you're getting an on overclockable cpu
though like a I 5 6400 and that's
totally fine they're less expensive and
not everyone likes to overclock you can
then be more open to other chipset
offerings so here's a list of them
specifically for skylake you got z170 h
170 H 110 q 170 q 150 be 150 the q and
the beet chipsets that are supposed to
be for business use since they have some
additional security features built in
but as you can see MSI has had no
problem slapping that V 150 into a
gaming board and there are definitely
other mother other manufacturers who
have done the same note the chipset
comparisons here but remember that every
board might implement the chipset
features differently just because the
chipset has eight USB 3.0 ports
available for example doesn't mean that
they will all be there and available as
physical plugs on the board by going
with the lower numbered or not Z
lettered and then also theoretically
lower priced options that's usually the
main benefit you're getting by going
with the lower end chipset is they're
just cheaper you're going to lose out on
some higher-end features so you might
not get SLI supports there
might not be as much peripheral
connectivity like USB and SATA ports and
note this one specifically for the B 150
you don't get raid supports and that's
something that I do kind of like to have
so finally let's take a closer look at
this MSI be 158 gaming pro the board
itself is pretty definitely but actually
we're going to start off by looking at
the manual I know that's where the good
stuff is here we can see standard PCIe
set up 16x bear in mind there is no SLI
also bear in mind this is a dual manual
it's used used for both the h1 78 and
the B 150 a versions of this board so
even though both of these boards have
six SATA ref three ports the be 150
again does not support raid that is kind
of sad but I guess that's what the H 170
a is for if you don't want a reply
bility but you do want raid moving on to
USB they gave us all six available USB 3
ports and even made them all 3.1
compatible very nice msi only four of
the available six USB 2.0 ports are
actual plugs but they did make up for
that by adding an as media controller
for two more USB 3.1 ports so that makes
up for it the board itself is black with
red accents on the heatsinks a nice
finish on the PCB and clearly some
attention was paid to looks here since
it has this mystic lighting feature with
LEDs going up to the left and right side
of the board all yeah it's dance party
time
I think case lighting is fun but kind of
Impractical to be honest at least when
it means paying more for what is really
supposed to be a budget board comparing
other be 150 board options even if we're
only limited to msi boards there's a lot
of sub $100 choices that might not light
up but have very comparable features so
to sum up the chipset choosing challenge
I have three main points I think you
should take away first always get a Z or
X Series chipset or just an overclocking
enabled chipset if Intel decides to
change that ZRX thing in the future
make sure it's overclocking enabled if
you're getting an overclockable CPU
second is give other chipsets a look if
you're on a budget if you have a non
overclockable CPU or if you just don't
need as much I owe or fancy features
like raid or SLI you're not planning on
using them why pay for them third you
should always reality check what
motherboard yeah
actually choosing even if you've
researched the chipsets they don't
always implement all of the features of
any given chipset on any given
motherboard so reality checking is
definitely important ultimately I feel a
little bit odd about the be 150 a gaming
pro from MSI mainly due to the existence
of the kind of blingy lighting features
and a relatively high price tag it's a
hundred and twenty dollars and for that
much you can get a z170 board
I am always one personally who will opt
for more speed or more usable features
over aesthetic improvements like LED
lighting but I suppose it does have that
USB 3.1 on there which is nice and
there's someone out there who's on a
very specific budget but who also really
really wanted to add that touch of flair
to their build and he can't get windowed
cases for very cheap now so I suppose it
is cool to have that RGB control but if
I may echo a sentiment that I've heard
many many many times since RGB lighting
became popular in the last I don't know
year please MSI and other manufacturers
make the rest of the design color
neutral if you have RGB lighting
preferably all black all white might
work too but these red accents on here
they're pretty small but they're still
red and I feel like that limits what
colors you can actually use with RGB
because you got to match them with the
red that is all for this video though if
