and there's that everything's going
according to plan
somehow all right hello everyone welcome
to awesome hardware the live show that
Kyle and I do every Tuesday evening
although we haven't done it for the past
two weeks so we're actually sort of
getting things back together here we're
trying to make it like it used to be
like old times
also both of us are suffering from jet
lag myself to a pretty significant
extent at this point actually um look
and yeah that Josh was just texting but
the quality everything's fine you guys
are home all I think it's perfect
you got shock cool words of incorrect
yeah it is election night but we're not
talking about election stuff on the show
it's about technology and that kind of
thing yeah there's enough of that going
around already if you miss the first
half it was on Kyle's channel which is
called bit wit so go watch that it
should be linked in the description
although I don't think I've updated that
right now I'll do it soon that's and
we're going to start this half off off
with a quick announcement for any of you
guys who happen to be local here in the
Southern California area we're going to
be having a meet-up this weekend's it's
going to be on Saturday November 12th we
haven't told you exactly where it's
going to be but Los Angeles Orange
County area is kind of where we're
aiming for
so that's what you should expect so if
you're in that area you should be able
to attend it's going to be from 11:00
a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Saturday so if
you're around keep an eye on our
Twitter's my Twitter and Cal's Twitter
will be tweeting some stuff out probably
on Friday the 11th the day before and
we'll let you guys know exactly where
it's going to be and bring cash we'll be
selling stuff it'll be kind of like a
tech garage sale you know what I was
gonna say bring cash I was gonna leave
at that as
be mysterious gals just got to tell you
all in frigging detail we're selling
what a cow selling stuff good cows have
the check like way more details where
Kyle will tell you every possible thing
you might need to know about this
giveaway you tell people what they want
to hear whereas on my half I leave I
leave it to mystery so cryptic mainly
cuz I'm literally falling asleep as as I
see at what point during your heifer
she'll have to take over and just start
hosting yeah exactly according to this
note that I wrote down I real quick guys
if you want help support us and our
channels and you want to buy some good
quality merchandise bit wit tech slash
store this cattle store where he sells
all these wonderful t-shirts and hoodies
look at all of them and all the
gloriousness yep my store is Paul's
hardware net or store pulsar brunette
where you can now buy some women's cut
t-shirts I got the thumb screw and the
zero insertion force for my two female
viewers out there that's for you guys
you know there might be three of you out
there I according to Google Analytics
there's not very many female viewers but
hey there's a few so there you go now I
just feel sexist wear jewelry nice
denial sucks Israel I also got the thumb
screw organic cotton beanie which is
just the height of fashion for this
winter it is an embroidered logo
therefore the thumbscrew and it's all
all sorts of fabulous as well as all the
other merchandise that you've come to
know and love on my store utin thank you
for buying stuff and we'll give you guys
a shout out at the end of the show
provided we remember yeah alright that's
all for announcements let's start with
second half of the show which always
starts with news yes the lower thirds
Moo so you know we excited I'm excited
for this news I had some next-generation
stuff coming from Intel we've talked a
little bit about skylake X and KB Lake X
in the past it seems more and more
certain now that that is actually what
it's going to be called so this is the
enthusiast platform the not mainstream
what you would currently be on now if
you're rocking
like 11:51 LGA 1150 LGA 1155 those are
the mainstream sockets these are the
enthusiast sockets which usually have
more pins to that ends this article
which is derived
it's a WCC F Tech article which is
derived from a bench life that info
article as they so often are in
preparation for the 2017 this is
translated from Chinese by the way until
skylake x processors begin to send
samples so according to this sampling
has already begun cool I don't have one
no I don't I'm going to have to try to
get one yeah but yeah if this is true
then the high-end sky like X and KB like
X processes will be launching in the
second quarter of 2017 which to me means
Computex Jun Jun is within the second
quarter and that is often when new
launches happen and hey I am never going
to complain about some high ends desktop
stuff being launched at Computex nope
but bench life goes on to give a few
details about these processors at least
both the KB like X and skylake X
processor lines will be based on 14
nanometer architecture much like the
skylake and KB like mainstream
counterparts for either series but KB
like X since it is the newer one will
feature a more optimized chip design the
that the KB like X has only four cores K
series processors that's kind of
interesting
so newer more refined design but only
four core processors do you think that's
going to mean like a price point between
KB lake and scale like X I don't know it
certainly seems like kind of a meeting
of the two of these because normally the
high end desktop stuff from Intel is
derived primarily from sort of a
continuing alongside the like Z online
like that's usually what it what it
falls in line with and and like the
desktop stuff the mainstream stuff it
kind of does its own thing
enthusiasts stuff will usually you know
fall in line a little bit before a
little bit after the Zeon or the work
station counterparts for it so but I
don't know right now it seems like we
might be seeing sort of a coming
together a confluence if you will
emerging a bumping of uglies it yes like
a sexual intercourse relating in at some
sort of freakish hybrid offspring mmm
intercourse that's put too fine a point
on it
um but yeah but KB like x4 core
processors with a 95 watt TDP but being
on this high-end desktop line which is
going to feature x2 99 chipset the x2 99
chipset and LGA 2066
socket motherboards which is all very
new very very new stuff we haven't heard
about that before any of the continuing
along with what the article reveals
further here down below skylake X which
seems is going to be more capable I mean
if if skylake X is what's going to have
the multi-core processors and KB like X
is going to have just quad-core skylake
X although it won't be as refined will
have 140 watt TDP 10 8 and 6 core
versions as well as three other options
but the number of PCIe channels will be
different so skylake x pcie 3.0 maximum
channels will be 44 that is up for
that's for more than what we currently
have on Bradwell e 44 but that's limited
only to the 10 core version which who
knows is I'm scared as to how much
that's going to retail for though going
to cost $1,700 what if it's like $2,500
now for like a 15% is it just going to
keep getting more expensive it's
terrifying I don't know but they are
we're told there will also be an 8 core
sky like X although they were not able
to determine the number of PCIe channels
for that one and then there's a
six-course guy like X will have which
will have a maximum of 28 PCIe gen3
lanes so still pretty solid it does seem
like they're continuing to use
PCI Express Lanes to differentiate the
chips in this line but I thought there
was a chart down here here's a chart
anyway the WCC F Tech article does have
a chart down here that kind of lists
what we know at least as far as the
leaks that have happened for K be like X
and skylake x compared to Broadwell E
and yet I don't know keep you like X it
seems like an interesting position yeah
4 cores 8 threads at max but it will be
faster I would assume on an instructions
per clock level than the skylake X
processors yeah but skylake X is where
you going to get your big core counts
you know 10 core 20 thread it's going to
be great for work stage man ok more in
less than gaming more cash yeah actual
full gen 3 legs I mean this this is
listing only 16 PCI Express gen3 lanes 4
KB Lake X and i7 7000 series processor
on this platform so that's that's kind
of weird
it's kind of a weird positioning for
that chip and what we're probably really
going to have to wait and see is how
that's going to line up against like the
Z 270 and mainstream KB Lake stuff
that's coming out because presumably
there will be a fork or eight thread
like 7700 can yeah right so like really
what's the difference with K be like X Y
s gonna be a nice questions it's
interesting but it's weird if they are
launching at the same time then it does
kind of mean that Intel is at least sort
of getting their platforms on the same
numbering scheme they haven't done that
for quite a while well have we'll have X
299 for high end desktop and we'll have
X 270 or Z or Z 274 mainstream desktop
and probably H 270 and a few other
variants like that as well right
moving on to our next story all right so
i retweeted thing that luke tweeted
earlier this week and it was about
nvidia and some of the stuff that
they've been doing recently
now the original thing came from reddit
pcmasterrace article which was talking
about a major geeks revelation that
nvidia has begun doing telemetry and
data collection through geforce
experience through the GeForce
experience utility and this thread which
has 836 comments as of now goes on for
many a year and many comments for people
talking about various different things
now when I originally looked at this
reddit thread I was a little offended
mainly because of some end user License
Agreement stuff that was posted there
that was in conflict one with the other
which has since but fortunately been
laid laid to rights and correct it a
little bit but nevertheless I thought I
would bring up and discuss it here
because basically what is telemetry
telemetry is data collection and then
sending that data to a server somewhere
to collect it to have more information
now telemetry can collect a wide variety
of data it can collect non personal data
it can collect personal data and really
it's going to be up to the software to
determine what is collected and where
it's sent in that kind of thing and
whether or not it's encrypted the
complaints on the original reddit thread
where that now suddenly Nvidia has
turned on this telemetry this data
collection in GeForce experience it's
collecting user data it's sending it
willy-nilly over the Internet's and
collecting information that really
doesn't need to be collected or it's
collecting information that will then be
gone and shared with like Nvidia
marketing partners so that you know you
suddenly get new
add emails in your ad or something like
that that you didn't get before
something like um which honestly people
got upset at and I got a little upset at
and I was like that's wrong and stupid
but as Steve Burke wrote in his article
here which is also linked in the
description this is a gamer's nexus
article Steve instead of getting mad and
as he reminded us all in the beginning
of his article level-headed approach
offers Tibetans best insight instead of
getting mad he contacted NVIDIA so the
smart thing to do I actually got an
email from Brian from Nvidia as well
about this and then he also went the
extra step of going and monitoring the
GeForce experiences packet in-app
transactions using some software what
software do you use I wrote it down here
some points Wireshark is what they use
to monitor packets so I'm just going to
run down my notes here because they'll
probably be the most same way to do this
since again I'm suffering from jet lag
again I'm probably not being very
coherent but this recent thread blew up
for its citation of a major geek article
that described invidious driver package
as spying on user data this sparked
users to dig up a French magazine canard
PCs publication of Nvidia's updated
privacy policy and end user License
Agreement which apparently focused on
collection of system hardware
information by GeForce experience
GeForce experience 3.0 which was just
recently pushed last week requires user
account registration and also requires
sign-in in order to fully deploy
shadowplay which is a very popular
utility for capturing user gameplay
especially stuff that was you know just
happened 30 seconds ago
as it works really well now you need to
sign in and provide your user
credentials and stuff in order to use
this now the complaints happened because
the EU la citation the Andrews License
Agreement citation at least the one
those posted on the original reddit
thread that was taken from the PC
master-race posters who posted that is
from a privacy policy which governs the
video.com website which is not the same
as the end-user License Agreement and
privacy policy that governs the GeForce
experience application so applying the
one from the website to the application
itself the was written about the website
is basically like we can take your
information and we can share with our
advertisers and do whatever the whatever
the hell we want with it
pretty much was what it said now if you
apply that to drivers but I mean it's an
egregious offence if you apply it to
GeForce experience it's crappy but not
quite as good but honestly this hasn't
been applied to either this is where I
was misled by some of the statements in
the actual original reddit article
because I looked at both of those and
said well obviously they're saying two
different things and my opinion based on
working with large companies would be
like well whatever the best thing for
the company is probably what they're
going to default to but honestly that
wasn't even true because again they're
taking something from the Nvidia comm
website which is if you sign up there
for an account and like you know for
them to contact you about you know we
have these great deals from our partners
or whatever that kind of thing that's
what that you you LA is applying to the
EU LA that applies to the GeForce
experience yes does have some language
in it that refers to the sharing of your
information with Nvidia but it is
information that is necessary for
GeForce experience to do what it does
because GeForce experience is all about
looking at the hardware that you have
installed on your system
cross referencing that with a bunch of
other different comparisons that it's
done a performance of different video
games other people's systems and giving
you the best possible at least as far as
it can tell settings for the different
games you might be playing in order to
do that yes it needs to collect and what
is listed here in the article the
following information the GPU
specification and vendor the GPU clock
speeds and / clocks monitor and display
resolution driver settings for specific
games such as G sync toggling and type
of anti-aliasing used resolution quality
settings for specific games games and
applications that you have installed
which does seem kind of invasive but
they're trying to figure these games so
here are the profiles we will give you
for those games that's part of what
GeForce experience does memory capacity
CPU specification bios for vision and
motherboard none of this stuff is
uniquely identifying to you it's
uniquely identifying to your computer
but as it doesn't tell them exactly what
you do now granted there's some other
stuff that might be communicated such as
when you first sign up for GeForce
experience and that kind of thing that
remains to be seen the end result here
the summary that Steve from gamers Nexus
came to or the kind of end conclusion
and I agree with him is that GeForce
experience is gathering the information
it needs to do the job that it is
intended to do which is to give you
settings for your games if you don't
know what the settings should be that
should be good settings for your
resolution and for your hardware and for
the game you're playing right it doesn't
not seem to be taking personal
information and sharing that with third
parties Nvidia in their statements that
they've delivered to to gamers Nexus
here and the email that they sent to me
as well was like we don't do that we're
not we're not trying to like get your
email address and share it with a bunch
of marketing partners so you'll start to
get eat so basically they're not Windows
10 they're not doing what Microsoft was
it was getting so much fro from what
they have said yeah from what gamers
Nexus has reported on and what they've
done in their testing and from several
other tests that have been done by some
other people that have been reported on
this thread and elsewhere yeah there
they seem to be for the most part on the
epinet that said if nvidia was doing
something like this I think the reaction
would be perfectly well warranted and
reasonable because we pay nvidia for
graphics cards we have a reasonable
expectation that they will provide
drivers for the graphics cards that will
help them to work with whatever
operating system we're doing we're not
like using their service like we might
say an Android on a smartphone or Chrome
or Google you know we're not getting
free stuff from that
not really paying much much for up front
if nvidia started to do that sort of
thing yes we would be very well
warranted and getting mad at them and i
think it's worth keeping an eye on what
information is being sent back and forth
by these applications and especially by
just the base level driver yes we should
be keeping that keeping an eye on that
and holding Nvidia to a certain standard
but overall this drama at least of the
past few days does seem quite blown out
of proportion as far as what is actually
being done with the drivers and yeah I
think there should be some pushback
against requiring registration with the
email address and everything but as long
as they're not you know taking that
information and putting you in on
mailing lists or something like that
translates to your face or trying to
sell ads to your face really what the
back-and-forth is doing is mainly doing
stuff like getting game box add art for
the GeForce installer and you know shows
a little ad for whatever the latest game
is as its installing the g-46 geforce
driver so it's like this jennipher it
works really good with this game you
know that kind of thing I think I think
the main difference is that they're
actually the data that they're
collecting is used to for the intent of
helping you as a gamer right like you
said it's the intent of what the
application is trying to do which is
provide the best gaming experience for
someone who might not be ready to just
jump into the game settings and just
built in like no I'd like which settings
do I need to use like in my mind ultra
high medium do I use anti-aliasing
that's where thing like it needs to
collect certain amounts of data in order
to provide the best experience for you
if you can do that stuff yourself you're
not comfortable with the data they're
currently collecting then just don't
enable GFE just just just uninstall it
or just don't use it don't have it run
on startup but if you are expecting
those sorts of services from Nvidia you
can expect them to provide those types
of services without collecting some kind
of data in order to best serve you so
it's kind of like well what do you
expect from them and you can't expect
them to work miracles if you don't give
some of your data in return and
and it seems like from what this article
is saying and from what the research
that Steve has done it gamers Nexus it
doesn't seem like it's anything super
invasive of your privacy it's more so
facts or analytics of your your personal
computer that don't really tie back to
you as a person but more so of your your
settings as an admin or user okay so and
if your I can dig that if you're really
super paranoid the reddit thread that's
linked in the description does go
through the instructions for turning off
the telemetry telemetry communication
back to Nvidia so you can do that too
but yeah I do think it's worth keeping
the eye on to make sure that you know
nothing ever changes that starts
communicating more information than what
we would like shared but you can't have
an application that does what GeForce
experience does without doing that yeah
I guess to put it simply I know all
right
also next story is from the boob ads HDR
video support yeah so YouTube now has
HDR video and they're continuing efforts
to stay at the forefront of streaming
and display technology so that they can
stay competitive against other video
options like Netflix and Amazon YouTube
now has hgr support so whereas folks who
got like a 4k TV back when 4k TVs
weren't really a thing and then they're
like how can I find content and YouTube
was one of the first people to say here
is your 4k
and then the same thing they did with
like 360 video and that kind of thing
now HDR high dynamic range video will
now be supported there is not very much
source HDR material right now but this
will allow screens with the right
hardware to display a more accurate and
a realistic range of whites and blacks
as well as a wider range of colors and
then the but this is a big selling point
for new TVs I know I'm kind of looking
for a 4k TV right now and HDR support is
definitely something that I have in mind
it's a key benefit added by Microsoft
and Sony as well for the latest version
of the Xbox one s and the PlayStation 4
Pro and also
very capable for something like a
high-end graphics card to do I don't
know why the bridge left that out of
here they like to view any of this
contact right now you got to have a new
chromecast Ultra or you got to have an
HDR blu-ray player or you got to have
the Xbox one s excuse me the George or
pesco or like name B yeah organ card any
current generation graphics card which
includes HD HD are supports and stuff
like a support group DisplayPort 1.4 and
HDMI 2.0 a yeah so if you're like Fritz
right now if you're so if you're playing
a video game like right now whatever
what's your favorite video game that
you're playing right now pal probably
h1z1 I don't know if that one counts
anyway Wow why did devalue my
preferences as a PC gamer part of it I
feel really appreciated by right now I
don't I just don't know I don't want to
say that I want to hear it I'm here just
carry on your stupid story I'm trying to
carry on you're cutting me off you
yep you you so your graphics
card or whatever your display source is
well actually dummy down your signal it
will go to a standard dynamic range
signal as it's outputting whatever it is
it's outputting depending on what your
display sources of course but like a lot
of games you know they can render an HDR
just fine it just needs to say like oh
I'm connected to an HDR display oh well
don't take that color range and squeeze
it down to that much before it outputs a
signal let it all fly yeah you just uh
put the full HDR signal so yeah for
video games in particular you could
probably have support for this right off
the bat but nice to be able to take HDR
video since I'm sure there's going to be
lots of like really high-end cameras
with HDR support and everything that are
giving good source material for that I'm
bringing it back on right now we have to
replace all of our cameras with HDR
cameras yeah very soon lovely I never
mind the games report
this isn't even intentional okay
gigabytes gonna be making horace
motherboards and graphics cards
according to this article on digi x
kyle briefly mentioned this on his half
of the show did although his article was
from hexxus net and there's no pictures
here so i'm just going to turn that off
anyway did you guys know the gigabyte or
that horas is owned by gigabyte I did I
did I knew that too they don't like to
like advertise it that much but yeah or
yes or this is kind of a sub-brand of
gigabytes it's mainly being used to
release motherboards and no lapped no
I'm sorry gaming notebooks mice and
keyboards as well as some poor other
peripherals have been released under the
Auris line really nice gaming laptops
for sure they've had some really cool
options there as well as some innovative
type stuff what they're trying to do
here is create a product line that is
going to sort of match up against like
the Asus premium gaming and motherboard
and PC gaming line namely ROG or ROG
Strix so I feel like this is kind of
like what gigabyte was trying to do with
their extreme gaming series that they've
launched in the past generation or two
but now they will have like horas so
won't even say gigabyte maybe they'll
have like a little gigabyte logo on the
box or something we like to horas Z 270
gaming 5 I don't know what the hell but
call the actual graphics card yeah our
motherboard baya horas I would assume Z
270 and if we're going with the other
rumors from this this live stream I'm
I'm really I'm really starting to fade
it's okay
Z 270 as well as X 299 motherboards I'm
sure will be available from this Ora's
line as well as high-end graphics cards
so instead of your gigabyte highest end
graphics card you can buy a gigabyte
mainstream graphics card or like your
highest end like your 1080 ti horas like
sex edition with
xxx exhibition yeah that would sell
because sex sells x2 so I wonder if that
means gigabyte would no longer produce
high-end graphics cards or if they would
sort of compete in that same market as
horas like where they both have their
flagship GPUs or if they leave that to
like high-end stuff I don't know I mean
if you look at like it's like if you
look at Asus you know you can buy an
Asus GTX 1080 that is not an rog or a
Strix product yeah and it's still a 1080
and you know it's probably four o'clock
you know whatever the heck kids can do
but it's not like the best they could
possibly do yeah or whatever so that's
probably what they're gonna do right so
yeah I'm imagining they're still going
to be a lineup of gigabyte motherboards
as well yeah but they're like my guess
here would be there's not going to be a
gigabyte X $2.99 $500 motherboard now
that will be a Norris problem yeah okay
you know that kind of think the Miz and
whatever whatever's whatever's hat
that's what they'll do it's kind of
exciting
in a way I mean it's still from gigabyte
at its core but it's kind of cool to see
a different brand
it's very pushing out like flagship
level products like motherboards and
especially graphics cards I think that's
could be refreshing it could be cool I I
hope it I hope Oris has kind of its own
unique and diverse sort of style and
aesthetic apart from gigabyte kind of
like how ROG has their own separate look
from the regular asus line of things i
think that would be pretty cool I would
say the work that they've done with aura
so far is promising so taking that and
applying it to graphics cards and
motherboards seems like a good idea to
me yeah okay let's move on to the next
segment which is tales from space
because I saw some articles about space
this week and I was like those are
interesting so this is as close as I'm
going to get to election coverage here
but did you know that if you didn't vote
you really have no excuse because
there's astronauts that voted from
frickin space
I voted a the sticker I don't know if
you guys it's even in a different
sticker at there's several different
languages several different languages
because you know it's Los Angeles County
so there's a wide variety of languages
spoken there I see Chinatown I see
Filipino on there I think I see East
East LA we'll move to a cool toy yet I
dyed my own
that's an American hi American POTUS
yeah so anyway um you shouldn't feel bad
if you didn't vote I didn't know I was I
was alluding to that I I have sort of
Annabeth use that I'm not gonna get into
that that's fine but yes but the
astronauts even voted from the frickin
space station station believe it or not
this is all thanks to a bill passed by
Texas Legislature's in 1997 that puts a
technical voting procedure in place for
astronauts it's the Texas Legislature
because astronauts are often from Texas
I don't really how that works out
I don't know that's where the name Ewing
from he's the only astronaut I really
know and respect Buzz Aldrin no no see
alright this there's plenty of others as
well know a way in order to vote in
space the astronauts need to provide now
a year before they launch they select
which elections they will participate in
the local state or federal and then six
months before the election they're
provided with the voter registration and
absentee ballot requests so they
basically file an absentee ballot and
the first time this was done was the
same year was first implemented air
first yeah implemented which was 1997 so
you can vote you can vote in space vote
from space
and that fun thinking new from space I
could certainly do from her you're right
you'd think you'd have a better excuse
 you money again you I do all
right we talk a lot about SpaceX during
tales from space and the Falcon 9 rocket
explosion that happened several months
back it was definitely a bit of a
nail-biter a bit of a like whodunit
there's lots of speculation they seem to
have now finally decided what actually
caused this problem and it was caused by
aids aids no not by aids oh it was
caused by an ultra cold oxygen reaction
with the carbon fiber in the fuel tank
that was my second guess
I know it's aids and then that of course
as we all know oxygen freezes in its
gaseous state at minus two hundred and
eighteen point seven nine degrees
Celsius its gassy and as the rocket was
being loaded with oxygen spacex mixes
the oxygen with liquid kerosene and they
did it too fast basically which caused
it to freeze and then that apparently
led to that acute explosion that you
just saw Oh
anyways mace X launches could restart
before the beginning of 2017 I have
mainly heard like SpaceX is like yeah
before the beginning of 2017 that means
like maybe the end of 2016
realistic expectations seem to point
more towards probably the beginning of
2017 so maybe q1 2017 we'll see the
Falcon 9 fly once again sweet know
that's the sound that the Falcon nine
makes
oh all right the James Webb Space
Telescope is the most badass telescope
that you will ever probably know unless
you live more than 20 years or so the
final sun shield layer has been
completed for it and everyone should be
excited look at that I'm stoked those do
not just look like basic sheets of tin
foil and I'm sure that's really they're
not for this picture is from Northrop
Grumman's space park facility
Redondo Beach California for the last
five sunshield layers responsible for
protecting the optics and instruments of
NASA's James Webb Space Telescope is now
complete what you're looking at here is
about the size of the tennis court
really yeah these sheets right here
that's a tennis court science yeah a
tennis court no you could you could you
could beat me at face off all over again
see I thought that was like the size of
like maybe like a quarter of a 10 square
they need like a banana for scale but
look look at this picture here that that
would should see what I do what is that
those big dudes down here looks really
different look how big the freakin thing
is that's what it look at this like I
had no how's that relate those 10 giant
bees that must come to pollinate this
and they probably eat these these dudes
down here like pin the tail on the bass
is for to feed and yes they feed on them
into breeding anyway uh I just messed
this up so this is the size of a tennis
court is what I'm trying to say it will
make it possible for the James Webb
Space Telescope to image the formation
of stars and galaxies created more than
thirteen point five billion years ago
hmm
okay yeah I care about this yawning it
they don't care about the future of
technology's space and frights space
this will prevent the background heating
from the Sun yeah from interfering with
the telescope's infrared sensors no I'll
have me a super awesome I will have you
know I don't know uh and and and going
back to this ten tinfoil up here
right there five like tennis on it five
Sun shield membrane layers designed and
manufactured by the kneazle corporation
in Huntsville Alabama these are each as
thin as a human hair lots really lookit
ya know but it's because they're
crumpled at the edges it may gives the
illusion of thickness
human they will fold origami style into
the Ariane 5 rocket and then these will
of course be delivered up to the James
Webb telescope the world's next
generation space observatory I mean
origami style like it'll be accepted
into the Hubble telescope like it'll be
folded into a crane it's the data
there's a darkness of a human hair it's
got to be able to collapse into a fairly
compact package
what are they mean or shot up into space
origami styles like you know look at
this
this lotus we like fold it up into a
lotus I fold it a lotus flower when I
was in Taiwan and Thailand really yeah
did they give you like the paper and
like in the instructions on how to fold
it no is in Bangkok
okay go into the flower most women to
the flower market you should know how to
do that did you go to the flower market
when you're in Bangkok I think we missed
it's open 24 hours 24 hours a day you
can go there and wholesale buy flowers
and that's where like all the major
hotels in the area go and like they buy
flowers so like all the other little
like did you get it ever get any of
those flower necklaces the head looks
like the little white ones like the
lotus flowers with the folded flowers
and stuff like that no I feel like my
tat experience was so truly agreeance
Thailand clearly not
who needs flowers at 3:00 in the morning
though hotels on Alice Lee no they don't
I've never walked into a hotel three and
be like where the of the flowers
speaking of where the of the
flowers today's episode is brought to
you by fractal design nice transition
yeah thank you thank you very much
fractal design --less maker of
high-quality and sexy cases cases they
also do power supplies case fans water
cooling accessories and they have a new
case that's out right now which is the
affine C mini or defined mini see I
should say well that it's available the
define C series available in mini as
micro ATX as well as just a standard
Devine C which is full size I like the
micro ATX better
well Kyle and I both have hands-on
experience with the micro ATX version so
we encourage you guys to check out those
videos if you haven't already at a pvx
LAN this weekend over the last weekend
Fri Cole Josh were sitting right next to
me and he actually had brought a defined
mini C with him which had which was
loaded up pretty pretty nicely I had a
Kelvin 240 radiator in there as well as
a gtx 980ti i believe and he was um he
had better setup than me which kind of
aid me and made me jealous but it's a
nice looking case Paul and I have both
done reviews on it on our channels you
can go check those out if you want our
personal opinions yeah it's just net how
impossible for them to say anything good
about this thing and be genuine check
out our reviews because I think you'll
find that they're fairly favorable um I
like this case a lot lots of space for
cable management some good areas to tuck
away some mechanical drives if you are
if you're doing 3.5 inches as Kyle is
demonstrating right there as well as the
oh yeah I was like why is that hand so
two point five inch drives which are
also up there you can do three back
behind the motherboard tray what a great
video this is yeah you're you're viewing
right now
and I'm just trying to you know give you
some some coverage as I know I needed of
course in my video I fully utilized the
micro ATX form factor by installing not
just a graphics card but also a TV tuner
card and I was done infinite TV just as
just to show just show more practical
demonstration have a sexy time-lapse of
the cable management did you know did
you I didn't think that was really
necessary yeah well you know it's
 awesome
this is thought that would have been
stupid hey guys if you want more
information on either of these cases we
do have links in both of our video
descriptions on YouTube yes indeed or
you can if you're on Twitter you can
just go ahead and check out our YouTube
channels you'll find the reviews there
there pretty recently posted alright
groovy good times 3 is sell Thank You
self for being here for modding for
posting links and chat you or freaking
awesome alright ah no that's let's move
right along with the next segment which
is sword fight now sword fight is where
Cal and I take up arms against a sea of
troubles and by opposing end them
so I'm quoting Shakespeare
I don't know where that came from
because the point is we're going to
argue about some
usually I have a couple questions but
this week I just have one just one I
thought it was poignant and important
and something that all of us really
deserve an answer to yep given that
tonight's is a night of great import
especially here in the US of A I thought
I asked this very basic question which
is are we doomed are we doomed like just
are we doomed for life
are we doomed just
yeah just our are we are we doomed we
doomed the best we are doomed and Damned
posting that and all data chat right now
so you guys can answer as well so are we
doomed
yes chaos is descended and the world
will soon be consumed to the fires of
oblivion no the main mankind may stumble
we will always persevere through trials
to forge a better tomorrow oh boy and
then of course that other option but we
can't always be a third option um I'll
let you go first for you for you Bernie
Sanders fans up there all right since we
only have this one question and and
because because I believe not just in
you and me but us but in all of us
together I will say no no we are not
doomed Kyle we are not doomed because
though the night may be dark and though
we may face what may seem like
insurmountable odds I believe truly that
we can come together as a people and
that's you know my grandma always said
that a stick and a bundle won't break
right
that's from it's because I watched I
watched a movie on the airplane and that
quote was on that and they said that
quote so your grandma didn't really say
that no I'm totally believing it's a
fake grandma that doesn't that removes
nothing from the sentiment at all sure
does which is that you know if we come
together you know mankind historically
if you look back right look look look at
how we live right now right we're doing
okay we're not doing bad certainly there
are things in the past that were great
problems that we have overcome to now
live a better life than we did before
and you know everything's not perfect
but people ultimately will we'll work
together to make a better life for
themselves mass shootings are at an
all-time high Paul Casey I'm not done
yet
I'm not finished and that is why we are
not doomed we will not go quietly into
the night we will not vanish without a
fight
we're going to live on we're going to
where he says next this is our
Independence Day so is that the movie
watch on the plane if you just like I'm
gonna quote that for awesome hardway was
it was a long flight and then was
slightly delirious as I watched many
planes god I wish my movies okay it's
you sure okay thank you
we're all chaos has descended
upon the world and it shall be consumed
in the fires of oblivion we are doomed
doesn't matter who you vote for guys
this country is screwed and you know
it's they say the lesser of two evils
you vote for the one you think is going
to be the less shitty one this isn't
specific to the country this is
everything this is just everything okay
we're still
we are destined as a race to fail
there has never been a race in all of
existence that has made it you look at
prehistoric times whether you're talking
the dinosaurs or whatever other
species existed before that and nature
is just out to wipe us all out it's out
to get us
it does not care what we like or we love
or how we are as people it's just an
ever-evolving thing that will eventually
 us all over we are here for a split
second in the universe and then we're
gone whatever it is whether it be a
massive wipeout from a you know a
catastrophic natural disaster or one of
the presidents being elected it doesn't
matter we are doomed our days are
numbered we have a clock on all
of our heads and we are it's just
the nature of the world no species has
ever lived forever it's it's its life
you begin you start you live you're born
you live it and then you die so I hate
to be the bearer of bad news but it's
best that you figure this out early on
in life because it's not going to get
easier and the longer you keep living
this lie that you tell yourself that
everything's going to be okay the harder
the fall and the crash is going to be
when fate knocks on your door
one day and rails you in the ass Merry
Christmas this to to all of you though
who celebrate it you I'll be there
message of hope message if it's a
complimentary sandwich fist as I hey
sorry see let's see what you guys
thought are we doomed results big bad
milk you should feel bad ah oh wow
wow it seems like most even agree which
i was hoping would be the opposite of
the case wow I was hoping that then T
words were less pessimistic
more than no more than double of the
other two more than no and the third
party option
by which I have the third option would
have a good chance should always pardon
me Jesus should always have a third
party option well alright so on that
home
Merry Christmas let's
let's slip gently into the Q&amp;amp;A section
where we will theoretically answer a few
questions that you guys might have for
us before we all go and dig ourselves
again early grave apparently and for the
record that's not how I personally feel
I was just trying to trying to win the
argument now you didn't you did your job
all too well count okay yeah all too
well
that's what I was afraid of all right
all right clones questions we'll have a
few here we will also briefly if we have
any at least do some Johnson shout outs
I don't know I don't think I got any
though uh I don't think so either
I got one fine I got one yay Oh
Nakao yeah Carl Carl Carl that's the
number one thing that I get usually when
I tell people the photos you need Kyle
Carl no that is a Carl that's a class
cat Carl I'm sure you probably get the
opposite people like Kyle you know it's
Carl
thank you very much painting of a CPU
cooler shirt Johnson to you brother
appreciate that but that's oh a hair for
me on my end I wasn't that refreshing so
Jay tick min says I should go smoke a
dummy wait there was a question that I
thought we could answer just a moment
ago where did it go where to go yeah H
ones here Gibson DK asks H 110
motherboard with RAM at 3000 megahertz
works question mark no no I'm sorry
Gibson DK 3000 megahertz is qualified as
an overclocked memory speeds by Intel so
the only speeds you'll be able to get
within H 110 motherboard of the ones
that are qualified is not over clock
speeds which basically
means 2133 or sometimes 2400 depending
on the actual CPU that you're using
right so yeah sorry about that
what's the best way to connect the gtx
1050 to a VGA only monitor I don't can
you even do that
a dozen fifty even include an analogue
out you probably have to get an adapter
no didn't used to get an adapter you
wouldn't if it doesn't have analog out
yeah I mean you're screwed if you buy a
new monitor you should not yeah using if
you really buy a new monitor like any
VGA only monitor is going to be really
just crappy I mean unless hear like an
old-school CRT monitor person and then
yes I can see some of the benefits that
people get from using like the old
really high-end CRT monitors right
there's there's reasons to do that but
if you're using a VGA like older LCD
like it's it's not get a new monitor 150
bucks or even a hundred a hundred bucks
hundred bucks
jóska any panel Costco has a a 22 inch
Costco has a 24 inch led LG 5
millisecond monitor for a hundred bucks
right now I just saw it in my Costco ad
I'm not affiliated with Costco who do
you work for and I was like um who do or
buy I can't buy that for my parents
because they have an old like 3 by 3 4
monitor new and I keep like upgrading
their computer and then I go over there
and I'm still in a crappy old monitor
like dad buy a new minor he's like oh
yeah sure and I'm like no he won't know
as long as that new as long as that
existing monitor works he will not buy a
new I mean all parents are the same mine
mine are the same way I'm like there's
something way better good guy it's fine
it's minus 10 inches what more do you
need like 17 inch no dad 3 4 like stop
that's awful
so it's all fuzzy anyway the stir button
takes up a quarter of the screen
treyton sorry treyton asks how drunk are
you right now it's really not hard to
tell kinda drunk I mean I have torturing
him but
it's mainly the the jetlag yeah I am
loopy dude it's the same for me I would
like to just put my head down and fall
asleep right now you know be glorious
that would be absolutely glorious yeah
get a get a get an LCD with DVI or HDMI
or just some kind of digital connection
alright
1080 or 1074 1440p definitely 1070 that
can handle it no problem yeah I remember
back in the day I was rocking a GTX 970
overclocked and gaming on my cue Knicks
2 7 panel no problem which was 2560 by
1440 playing it GTA 5 max settings more
or less you know getting 50 to 60 65 FPS
on average so 1070 should be fine for
1440 just save yourself some money you
do not need the 1080 giraffe 2012 asks
best Ultrabook relief in laptop for
under three hundred and fifty dollars Oh
ultra book I don't think don't think
that exists yeah ultra book you have to
meet certain requirements to be
considered an ultrabook like he has to
be like super thin like under point zero
eight inches smaller and thinner and
lighter that laptops get the more
expensive they get yeah because I got to
spend more R&amp;amp;D to actually cram all that
hardware inside of a super slim form
factor so I don't think that's possible
if you need something that slim on that
price point maybe look at a Chromebook
or something like that okay yeah Patrick
Horgan asks Kyle why didn't you vote um
hmm what do you think because you were
jet-lagged well do you think do you
think I should it's that there's no do
you think there's any backlash of me
explaining why or backlash we're like do
you think it's a bad idea or should I
keep that hush I mean are you gonna be
talking about who you would would have
voted for that kind of thing
no know what Chad we're trying to be
nonpartisan in this episode no I
wouldn't talk about who I'd vote for I'm
just like remember like the whole thing
that happened and going through some
 as of late
what happened you know Oh
oh that yeah maybe wait till like
it's ironed out a little bit yeah yeah
wait till like it's yeah Jesus I mean
you can allude to that without saying
specifically I mean there was so there
is another that went down today
that we yet required your attention
yeah um some things that affected just
the channel in general which I was not
expecting it came out of left field and
totally he's illegal oh I think I
assassin impressive um yeah there was
some that went down that was a
pretty harsh on the channel I won't get
into specifics right now until it's more
ironed out until I have a better picture
of actually what's going on but some
really heinous things that came up that
uh just kind of prevented me from being
able to go out there and vote that
really knew it was it was an emergency
type of situation where I just needed to
take care of that first before I could
do things and yeah I've forfeited my
civic duty and ability and privilege to
vote something that our countries work
very hard for is that freedom so I do
feel bad and yeah but you know
happens
 happens and I think uh you know
California has made its choice already I
think it's made a decent choice and I am
NOT going to oppose it too much so yeah
I am going to that guy I will be able to
sleep well at night and I'm not gonna go
into it any further than that but okay
yeah that said I think is a good enough
time to end this week's episode of
awesome artwork yeah uh sorry this week
this week's episode has been a little
bit off kilter again both of us are
suffering from jet lag to some degree
and right about when the show happens is
right about the time it usually hits at
least if you're coming from the east
back to the west from like Asia back to
California or us
yeah it can be rough at that time dude
anyway though once again guys if you're
in the area keep an eye on our Twitter's
for later this weekend we'll be talking
about when we're going to have the where
we're going to have the get-together the
fan meetup on Saturday yeah hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoy this video
more videos coming later this week yep
and probably know after party tonight
just as I'm ready
we're still very jet-lagged and I still
have some stuff to do when I get home I
don't wanna make any promises so it's
probably unlikely to love the after
party in the rare event that we do you
can follow us on Twitter for updates
there's a decent chance I'll be passing
out within the next 20 minutes yeah and
I'm pretty sure when I get home wifey
sauce will slap me around yeah like that
no no she won't do that but exactly yeah
don't count on it for this week but I
thank you guys so much thanks everybody
have a good week we'll be back next week
with more awesome hardware</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
