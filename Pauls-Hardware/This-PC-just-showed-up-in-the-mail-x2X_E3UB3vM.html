hardware it is pouring rain outside
right now I don't know if you guys can
hear that but that's unique because it's
California doesn't rain that often but
I'm getting sidetracked I have a
mysterious package to derived to my P o
box recently normally my PA box which
was P o box for three to five dynabar
California I check every few weeks and
then we do a mail time segment on our
live show that we do Tuesday evenings
however this package is special and I
have to admit that I already kind of
know what's in here because this was
sent by Mike aka MB 67 or lenticular
he's very active on Twitter and during
our live streams and any any chats with
us a lot and he actually came to the fan
meetup that we just had last weekend and
he told me hey have you checked your P o
box yet cuz I sent you a computer that
was kind of surprising because I get
sent computer parts a lot from
manufacturers and everything but this is
the first time that like a fan just just
sent me a full computer which is really
cool and he had an actual specific
intended use case for this which is that
tomorrow Kyle and I are doing a charity
livestream we're gonna be live-streaming
for about 12 hours it's a twitch and
we're doing some extra life coordination
with that and raising money for
children's charities and he was like hey
you could add this to the giveaway pile
for that so that's pretty much what
we're gonna do this is a Dan case in the
documentation here so mike says hey Paul
Kyle I would like to donate this Dan
case eight for SFX V to build as a
raffle prize for your upcoming charity
stream before you tell me I'm crazy hear
me out it was initially built for the
sole purpose of being giving him what
given away to a worthy cause and he said
he can't think of a better cause than to
be raffled off for our charity stream
and mike says he actually does pc
building charity work on his own when he
can't he made a couple of minor changes
including a crucial p1 500 gig nvme
aimed to drive he swapped out a galaxy
gtx970 katana for ZOTAC gtx 1070 TI mini
because he wants to keep his 1070 katana
I don't blame you at all there Mike but
inside he has an asus strix be 350 ITX
motherboard i rise in 7 1700 cpu a
Noctua NHL 9 low-profile CPU cooler 16
gigs of g.skill trident z 3200 speed
ddr4 memory that crucial p1 500 yen vm e
SSD as well as the samsung 850 Evo 1
terabyte SSD the zotac 1070 TI mini and
a corsair s FX 600 watt small
form-factor psu and all that of course
in the dank
a 4sf xv2 case Mike also already
installed Windows 10 and Microsoft
Office onto it so it can be good to go
with a few minor updates and she again
is donating this to be given away during
our charity livestream it's so tiny so I
am going to disassemble this real quick
or at least take out the side panels so
we can take a look at Mike's handiwork
inside make sure it's all up to snuff I
have no doubt that it is but I imagine
you guys might want to take a closer
look at this to again because you have
the opportunity potentially to win the
system now I want to clarify when it
comes to giveaways and our live stream
so during the live stream we're gonna
have charity donations open so people
can donate while they watch the live
stream and we're gonna be doing
donations for the Children's Hospital of
Los Angeles this time around and at the
same time we will have actual giveaways
going on or actual sweepstakes that
people can go and enter so you won't
necessarily have to donate in order to
enter to win the giveaway and we're
gonna have three different systems that
were giving away this one the one I just
built recently and then Cal's got a
giveaway system he's putting together to
so again they're going to be going on in
tandem but you don't necessarily need to
donate in order to enter to win because
I believe there's some legal snafus it
can happen with that I've never actually
worked with the damn case I'm trying to
be careful here that I don't mess
anything up as I disassemble this but
fortunately these side panels come off
pretty easily all right it's got the
little prongs that hold the side panels
in kind of like fantex cases I'd like
that that's very nice and there it is
the system it's already put together so
I guess I don't need to do any work here
so that that's very nice I love how
compact this is and how everything kind
of fits in there especially with the
small form-factor power supply which is
situated kind of here at the back on the
side with the graphics card there's
actually plenty of room still here for a
little bit of ventilation to come
through of course there is a ribbon
cable PCIe extension cable that comes
from the motherboard on this side goes
under the graphics card and then comes
back around here for the PCI Express
connector so that can plug in properly
this is actually a good option for a
graphics card for this because two big
old fans to cool it and then that's
going to be positioned right up against
the ventilation here so there isn't a
dust filter on this but
you know there's not a lot of space
there anyway I imagine you could add one
there but that would probably hurt the
airflow just a little bit
anyway it's small enough that it's just
pretty easy to pop open and dust out if
you ever did need to I'm also realizing
that this system is actually a little
bit nicer than the system that I put
together which is which is right there
just because of the CPU mason mainly
this has a 1700 in it which is an 8 core
processor that one's got a 1600 X which
is a 6 core processor I've been
emasculated but that's fine I never feel
bad for accepting the generosity of
someone like Mike so Mike huge thank you
again for sending this over just to give
the possibility for a fan out there to
win it and then also hopefully to
encourage some additional donations
during our charity livestream I think
this is really well put together the
cable management all looks real real
nice and clean
Mike even included some of the
accessories you would need such as this
is just a little USB extension extension
and we also got the Wi-Fi adapters there
for the Wi-Fi because fortunately the
asus be 350 mini ITX motherboard there
does have Wi-Fi built in and for a small
case like this without much expansion
that's actually really nice also the 500
gig nvme SSD right there and then you
might also be able to see that some
Samsung 850 Evo which is right down
there at the bottom and that's a one
terabyte SSD added in there as well so
there it is the little mini build and
the Dan case sent over by Mike aka
lenticular or MB 67 who's a longtime
viewer the channel thank you Mike once
again really really impressed by your
generosity here and we're definitely
going to put this to good use via the
giveaway and I hope you guys have
enjoyed this little video here if
nothing else that's been a little bit of
a tour of a really compact and powerful
build in the damn case but once again
though we will have a giveaway setup for
this system as well as two other systems
tomorrow during our charity livestream
from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. Pacific
time we'll be tweeting about that on our
Twitter's so follow us there for more
information on when we get that kicked
off and that is all for this video guys
thank you again so much for watching a
big thank you finally one more time to
Mike for putting this all together and
we'll see you guys tomorrow
it should be a lot of fun</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
