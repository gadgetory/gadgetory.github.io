the description what's up guys welcome
to paul's hardware today's video is
going to be about my trip to Taiwan
specifically preparing for my trip to
Taiwan so I have three things I'm going
to cover in this video
each has its own place I guess here in
my channel first thing is going to be a
mobile shooting setup so I've been using
a monopod for quite some time
I'm gonna be upgrading this adding a new
cage for my gh 5 and I've also got a new
tripod head so I'm gonna drop that on
there also and this is just a short
quick update to the riptide computer
that's here behind me I do have the
cables for that firstly I'm not going to
be able to finish that bill until I get
back from Computex but for now I can
show you these awesome custom cables
that last months made aaron from west
mods just went yesterday and picked
those up so i'll show those to you and
then finally a quick rundown of the
hardware we're going to be using today
it's at Computex because we got to edit
on site there so we can upload the
videos for you guys to share all the new
awesome computer her brains coming out
so I'm gonna get started right here and
unbox my new stuff first off we got this
tripod head this is the MV 500 aah it's
a fluid video head with base it's
because I've been using this one by
bail-bond which is an adequate try fluid
head it's only about 40 or 50 bucks
depending where you buy it but it's just
it's not the nicest when you tighten
these down sometimes it still shifts a
little bit I'm still using these for a
couple of setups
here in the garage studio but we're on
the road I wanted something that's just
a little bit nicer
I'll set that up in a second but I want
to get the camera set up too so it's
ready to go on top so this is a GH 5
cage kits with top handles my small rig
it provides protection for camera
specifically if you're traveling and you
might drop it a mile and a quarter or
something like that this is gonna be a
bit of extra security also since it's a
cage that goes around the outside it's
got a bunch of like 3/8 inch mounting
holes on it it's actually 3/8 inch and
quarter inch mounting holes both
available right they're kind of
scattered throughout this product and
then of course it's gonna hold the
camera securely there at the bottom
while still providing access to the key
parts like getting at the battery or the
SD card slot adding a handle to the top
was an extra $30 this is the lens that I
usually use for chefs that I want to
look pretty it's a sigma 18 to 35 art
lens and it's used by many many
youtubers
since it is actually an EF mount lens I
have a Micro Four Thirds adapter here by
meta bones it's the meta bones speed
booster ultra 0.7 1x it's actually a
pretty heavy configuration and also a
bit bulky so I'm gonna remove this
entire thing and protect my sensor and
this is gonna stay at home lens I'm
using from for the trip is actually an
official panasonic lumix lens and it is
the HD 12 to 35 pretty wide angle and
the reason I like this lens is because
it's very small and it focuses very
quickly so as I'm moving around Computex
and trying to get footage of stuff I'll
often use autofocus just because it's a
lot safer in this type of shooting
environments and this thing focus is
really fast and it also doesn't really
make any noise just a single screw to
hold this on and this is not the most
expensive
cage that's out there there are some
more expensive ones that have the add-on
extras like the ability to have a hook
that goes around your HDMI input to keep
it from wiggling around or accidentally
getting getting pulled out for my
purposes though this is going to serve
me just fine provides the basic
protection that I wants and then I will
mount this to the base plates on the new
tripod this is the this is a lock for
the base plate also
release
still works
quick it focuses it's awesome all right
so our tripod head has a fluid drag
system here that can be locked down with
this knob then you can give it a nice
soft place to the side-to-side that way
and then we also have a fluid drag
system over on the side here it's not
adjustable like the bigger ones that I
think that's also to keep the weight
down then of course you got your
standard
lock right there so you can lock it and
do the tilts you can not the arm on
either side it's interchangeable hold
their arm and I messed with this
multiple times and then Joe came over
and figured it out immediately
this top plate here you actually put on
at an angle I was trying to slide it in
from one side like I do with the one
that I already had ups in an angle like
that and then can lock in that way and
that way I actually can't slide off
forward or backward you have to push
that down in order to do it and of
course each in tighten that down to lock
it as well
with me oh hey I wouldn't hunter done
this cuz it's a hex nut then I realized
small rig they're smart look Ellen rich
built-in right there held on with a
magnet
so yeah the on top of the cage provides
a structural rigidity throughout - down
to the base plates base plates can then
be attached to the tripod like so
tighten that down and the reason I like
to set up with the monopod is because
provides a bit more stability since it's
down on the ground this one has a little
feet so I can extend those and it
actually allows me to serve sway back
and forth a little bit or rock in at a
thing I'm recording and kind of put my
foot down there on the bottom to keep it
steady and then if I need to take this
entire thing and lift it up to move
around I can just lift it up by the
handle up on top now the other thing
I'll do it shows because I don't have a
dedicated camera person there and this
is I just discovered this rig can also
do this is to take the camera flip it
around on the mount up back in there and
you can do this with this tripod head so
that's cool then since I got the flip
out screen I can just point that at
myself make sure I'm framed it in focus
be holding the camera right here and
then I can start and stop it recording
my blah blah blah hockey bits and then
when I'm ready to record other stuff I
can get behind the camera and do that
it's actually a very flexible and simple
view setup for recording and an event
like hunting thanks for CES alright next
up a quick aside and a big shout out to
Erin from Webb muds because he made all
of these custom sleep cables for Riptide
which is back here behind me that
project will continue once I return from
coputex in the meantime you guys can get
a slightly better idea how it's going to
look when it's all finished and kitted
out with these beautiful cables that
Erin put together Erin's daughter
actually helped him out with these two
so shout out to both of them and these
are actually set up with two different
systems since there's two different
systems in that rig
so I'm going to take these out really
quickly and then put them back in the
bag so that I don't mess them up or
anything
you'll notice here actually a
combination of materials he's used
paracord as well as this is a PE T
variant that he also has available which
gives extra pretty cool effects you can
see sort of a different texture on the
blue there then you can on the white or
on the black then he also does the cable
comes as well they're all pushed down
here so that once I get them installed I
can spread them out wherever they need
to be so that the cables stay nice and
in line and of course I with a blue
theme it's mostly like that all black
system right now and there's a bunch of
RGB in there so I did wants the blue to
be sort of like the water for Riptide so
the idea that was that the blue there
would be for Riptide
and I was I almost chickened out I went
with like all white or something a
little bit more monochrome but he
convinced me to put a little color in
there and I'm glad he did these are the
cables for the smaller system the little
X 470 rig that's in there which only
needs a 24 pin and an 8 pin but I'm also
gonna position these in such a way that
they'll be very visible and evidence
when they're actually installed so
unfortunately don't have time to install
these right now but I'm really excited
that they're here and definitely excited
to get back to working on Riptide once I
returned from copy tanks and rounding
things out for the Computex setup here's
the rest of the gear and bring in most
of my audio when I'm on the show floor
or that Suites is going to be recorded
on this little tas game this is the dr
10 l this was actually rebecc--
recommended to me by Austin Evans so
I've been using this for a year or two
now it's a nice little self-contained
lav mic and especially unlike a noisy
wireless environment like on the show
floor where you wouldn't use Wireless
anything this has been very reliable
backup secondary and also to use for
recording voiceovers and whatnot back in
the hotel room is gonna be my zoom h6
I've got the shotgun mic attachment for
that since this actually sounds really
nice a collection of memory cards of
course I'm really enjoying my 256 gig
ones because they can just record
forever and you never have to worry
about space I might bring a few little
extra reading things like this is a
magic arm just in case I need to set up
a camera and somewhere special or
possibly a microphone to capture my
audio and then Joe's coming along so
he's going to be editing on this laptop
right here provided by gigabyte
gigabytes a sponsor for my coputex
coverages here so this
the arrow 14 this is a tiny little
laptop just a 14 inch screen but a lot
of power under the hood IPS screen -
which is nice I 770 700 HQ at 16 gigs of
DDR 4 and at 512 gig m2 SSD only thing
that's really missing is an extra hard
drive for storage but we're gonna add a
bunch of external drives to work off of
so should be just fine and since it's
best to have a lot of screen space while
editing we got a secondary monitor here
this one just connects via a USB 3
it's the Asus MB 169 it's actually I
believe a slightly larger screen than
the one on the laptop but this one's
cool cuz it's super portable very
lightweight as long as you don't futz
with the plug and disconnect it really
quickly you have it as a secondary
monitor and that will be the editing
setup
but guys that is gonna wrap it up for
this video we are pretty much ready to
go for copy techs although I think the
last thing I need to do is actually pack
I'm gonna pack a big bag of stuff and
I'm gonna make Joe carry it so if you're
interested in Computex coverage coming
out very soon
hit the subscribe button for sure wish
us luck in our travels and we'll be
reporting back to you from Taipei Taiwan
like at the beginning of next week
thanks guys we'll see you next time bye
bye alright</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
