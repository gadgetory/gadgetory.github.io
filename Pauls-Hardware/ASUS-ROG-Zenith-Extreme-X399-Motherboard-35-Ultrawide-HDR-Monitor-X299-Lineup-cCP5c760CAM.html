to you by MSI EVGA Tesoro g.skill and
Coolermaster so guys I'm over at the
Asus booth now I got to come here every
year because they always have so much
awesome stuff basically I'm in there
they're kind of finished goods area
right here very clean very white very
pretty but back through that darkened
the doorway over there is the ROG area
and Jennifer described this areas kind
of like an I got the business up front
the party in the back so let's go back
and check out where the party Ted let's
start off with some X - 99 motherboards
here at the Asus booth this is not part
of the ROG lineup this is from the prime
lineup which is a bit more mainstream
when it comes to eight pieces offerings
here probably at least a little bit
familiar with how they line things up
from the Frank series we have a couple
boards that X 299 prime - a of those XQ
99 prime deluxe and the deluxe is
probably going to be the one that comes
out first that's what we're looking at
right here so you're going to see always
all the full complement of a dim swap
they've also got a new dot - that's down
here towards the bottom we also have
like all the stuff you would expect on a
deluxe board surface mounted parameter
debug LED all that good stuff
the first going to be compatible with
Asus five-way optimization so the
automatic overclocking functions that
you can just plug in and then we've got
a couple of ticks left one is X or will
passively cooled at least by the
heatsink which trade down here there's
another vertical one that's great in
here just great way to unclog because
you get plenty of airflow going over the
top of that I like what they've done
with the design here is pretty much
thickened with the black and white
aesthetic with some gray and silver
accents and of course this also is going
to feature RGB LED lighting
before I show you the X $2.99 - a here's
the hyper M 2 by 16 card
this could be an add-on it's not doesn't
come with any of these words that
basically they said that they have bran
like up to 20 m dot two devices in the
same system with this card you can
actually slot in for M two devices on
there they said there is a hardware
controller on there to assist with
connecting the devices I don't believe
it's a RAID controller but it says that
you can actually kind of lose the
scaling up of the speed after about 12
drives but hey if you don't have enough
in that see where you got to on these
boards by default and you can add
someone with the hyper M does move by 16
cards
here's they look at the H use prime X -
99 - a so isn't going to look very
similar to the X - 99 interlocks it's
not going to come with the same
accessory kit like the deluxe is going
to give you the Thunderbolt card as well
as an extension one doesn't come with
that price it's going to be a little bit
less they're still going to get a very
similar configuration to our delivery as
well as connectivity firm dot 2 as well
as of course that he pick which is going
to help keep those M devices and that
being right to slice into it so if
there's a watch this a little bit out of
your price range then a prime is
probably going to be
more suited to you it is probably going
to be the most expensive x99 board from
the ones releases and watching though
that one would be the cover there's B
suspects $2.99 mark - this is a slightly
more kept down version to the top and
this one's probably going to be the most
affordable XD 99 motherboard from the
80s table of boards that week that
they're coming out with right at launch
date so you're going to have this all
the tough identifying features that you
might expect you know it's got that a
very rugged durable aesthetic gets tough
logo I mean not always looks good
doesn't make anything faster but you
know stylish keeping keeping me stylish
is always nice you got a single m dot C
right here and you've got an additional
vertical and SP with a we have says
mysterion steel-reinforced flop but if
you want to go really hard tour with the
stuff you want to be marked one which is
down here there's the top X to 99 marked
one this one has thermal armor as
nations has been doing with a lot of
their top serious boards up around the
PPI and up around IO up here as well as
some additional stuff going on up in
there what is it it's a button
and all that's in them okay but that's
so you can still press to them okay
button which is used for making sure
that your memory compatibility is there
you have a problems just getting your
system up and running due to a memory
issue none okay button is very helpful
for that you do get the USB 3.1 gen2
front panel connector on this one right
in there very nice to have that it is
Gen 2 so you get the full complement to
pull bandwidth that's available with Gen
2 and that's super nice for connecting
external devices so you guys also the
slotted in Thermal Armor here to protect
dust from getting into the crack then
you have a bit of active cooling here
there is a fan here for the chipset as
well as again an MDOT to device we can
connect right down here keep everything
nice and cool I keep it under the
thermal armor and then back here on the
IO tons of connectivity again you have
to be really 3.1 gen2 type-c there as
well so plug in plug in all your
external devices right there if you get
a bit of lighting gear on the top mark
one as well you can see on the ultimate
course logo right there that's kind of
new for the stuff series that's not
something that's been there before but
you know if you're not in dart to be
lighting and you want something that's
completely low-profile Casey says always
do a good job of allowing you to turn
off the LEDs in the UEFI or using this
software let's just go right to the top
end next guys this is the RG rampage 9
extreme x2 99 and the top-end shrim
issue so what can be said here first up
with the let's talk aesthetics first
they have added some translucent covers
over the armor so up on the i/o as well
as down here on this extra armor that
they put here around all the PCI Express
expansion slot just really cool look
from the LEDs down here kind of just
softly flowing over the texture they put
there's the same thing on the top left
as well as down towards the bottom
nice big RG logo there's well all RGB
and control and this one is just it's
ownership
the cat's got the extra stuff that we
wouldn't expect to see so then the top
right is what they're calling dimmed to
which is an MDOT two riser Clarke riser
card that flush into a dual inline
memory module pocket there's what so you
don't lug memory in there and you close
this little card now that allows you to
mount an MDOT see for that
give yourself an extra MDOT to put it in
a position where it will potentially be
getting some active cooling especially
if you're using an air cooler on the CPU
or just the position that takes a little
bit further away from the heat
contamination of other components like
graphics cards and that kind of thing
next now you're going to see all the
connectivity points for monitoring
voltage there's some dip switches for
doing things like turning off the IE
lanes all the really high-end stuff that
they put on the extreme boards just to
make sure that you can go maximum
overclocking accessory-wise this is
actually going to come with a 10 gigabit
ethernet expansion part just the pci
expansion first that's really nice to
have there's a little bracket that you
can also use it's just going to connect
to your PCI Express expansion slot to
provide some GPU support so if you have
a large heavy GPU you should just get as
much sag or hopefully minimal lag with
that and this one even comes with
integrated Wi-Fi not 802 not 1188 OSU
got 11a be the new standards for Wi-Fi
which gives you up to 4.2 gigabits per
second of available bandwidth which is
just crazy so there it is the rampage 9
extreme XP 99 and probably it's going to
be very expensive but you know it's like
it works though
I look round up the X 299 boards before
we move over to the AMD X 399 board that
they have here behind me this is the Rd
fixed hg19 ie gaming if the rampage
anionic stream is a little bit too rich
for your blood if it has welded so many
effects if you're looking for something
that is of course gaming ecstatic gamer
grade with all the features that you
would want in a gaming motherboard
I already strict series has been doing
that for quite a while so RGB LEDs of
course I can't go wrong there at least I
like Asus implementation of these now
let me turn that down so you can
actually see that I've got the Arg
backlit logo you're kind of like reading
in there it's a straight hole and that
will accent here upon the i/o as well
pretty minimal they seems like they've
actually sounded that a little bit from
some of the excuse some people are V 270
boards that we've seen in fact there's
no RGB down here towards the bottom
these are of course units will have RGB
headers on them they can connect up
devices if you want to and there's now
including support for individually
addressable Ari LED strips of LED strips
like you might be familiar with like env
XP has I mean obvious I'm not saying
those are compatible but they can
individually address these LEDs to give
you a call effect or justify you to do
more than just the basic setup of here's
an LED strip that's a single color which
is an awesome thing to be able to do so
I'm glad that Asus is including that I'm
imagining you're going to have
specialized LED strips that will be
compatible with that that anyway beyond
that we have again a pretty
full-featured board here
LGA 20 2016 6 socket 8 DIMM slots and
steel-reinforced PCI Express expansion
Club you do have a debug LED header down
there in the bottom
see RGB header right that is pretty
standard and then I believe this was the
special RGB header right there as well
as individually addressable you don't
have surfaced on a power reset on
Jonah's board so if you keep that in
mind
however they have continued to give you
tons of support for high speed up to see
them maybe a Satheesh them that few red
up here as well as another MDOT tube
that's going to be down here below the
chips that heatsink and then finally
again you've maintaining the
connectivity for front panel USB 3.1
gen2 with that connector that agency was
one of the ones who originally helped to
develop so I'm like I'm liking to see
that I'm pretty much all the board's
routine here all right good all right
here it is I'm excited I'm excited I
mean I just I just went through all the
X to 99 board but I'll be honest I'm
almost a little bit more excited about
this really cause it's my first x3
anyone xx 399 board this is a thread
Ripper board it's for AMD's new line of
high-end desktop processors they just
have recently been announcing and
teasing and I mean alright so I should
tell you what it's called is the RG
Venus extreme so whereas before we've
had or like crosshair that's been the
name for like most of the Andy boards I
now has beat it and it is the extreme so
I don't know if they're going to have
like a you know formula or probably not
an impact
I doubt we'll see an impact version of
this board but who knows this has been
crazy a thing from the back so related
to that I mean I mean there's so many
limited specs that I can tell you about
this board so far but we do have squad
channel ddr4 memory support Andy has
just released a little bit more
information about the Red River the CPUs
are supposed to have
sixty-four PCI Express Lanes we're not
show care how they're going to be
configured whether it's going to be any
elimination so far as restriction as
restrictions or anything like that but
64 PCIe Lane considering that Intel has
taken like they're eight for Burk and
dropped it down to 28 PPI a Lane 64 on
every thread Ripper hurt so that means
funds would connect it like you can give
full complement of PCI Express lanes for
all four z CX / substantial expansion
puffs down there if you want the
four-way quadrille support that kind of
thing if you want to set up a massive
rendering system it seems like it's
poised to have a pretty big impact on
the high-end desktop market asus has
told us again you are going to get the
changing of it Ethernet card with this
board as well that's nice to have beyond
that again there's not just a ton of
stuff I can tell you about this because
AMD has still been not holding pretty
close to their chest as far as
additional spectively you can't be a
couple playing a couple knuckles you see
power connectors up there though we have
surface modifier reset I'm imagining
they're going to have a ton of stuff
over here for overclocking we have no
idea what over-talking is going to be
like with predator with 16 points and 32
threads though you know it might be
limited who knows but personal seeing
you got to that USB again 3.1 gen2
connector right there and just you with
a nice clean looking guard just a little
bit RGB lighting
I'll have some aces so
cool what they have inside here I really
hope you see thread Ripper come on
public Jason Oh guys let's move over the
monitors this is the rog swift pg3 5vq
and i want it if you guys aren't
familiar with life setup at home having
a through predator x34 which is a
34-inch g-sync panel this is like the
step up from that and I have no idea if
there's probably going to be other
vendors that also have this size and
resolution but 35 inch ultra wide qHD is
what they call it 34 40 by 1440
resolution no 21 by 9 and you have a
display for one place for an HDMI 2.0 as
far as being able to connected but has a
frameless curved design frameless is
subjective in my personal opinion but it
is definitely curved HDR supports 512
zone LED backlight which means you're
going to have excellent black
reproduction thousand candles per square
meter peak brightness for a really
really high contrast ratio and Nvidia
g-sync support without this 200 Hertz
refresh rate oh my god so big widescreen
awesome resolution for gaming GT support
quantum dot technology as well so that
increases the color gamut that's
available at the DCI p3 and it even has
illuminated LEDs the RG logo is
projected down onto the bottom as well
as a really cool RGB LEDs design across
the back of the monitor which you can
either just have set a football or you
know even project back against the wall
behind the monitor a little bit
for a really cool look for your gaming
setup I just also wanted to point out
that they're making a new push into
precinct monitors so if you saw the PG
Theory we now have the XP theory the PG
series is going to have GP the XP theory
is going to have precinct so would be a
very very nice monitors I imagine I hope
to combine with one of AMD's mill Vega
GPUs if they ever get around to
launching the gaming versions of those
this one in particular is the x key 3 2
vq 30 1.5 inch widescreen marker 178°
viewing angles as it is i PS this one
has made hundred and forty four Hertz
refresh rate and of course variable
refresh technology with the depth of
sync or precinct so you're going to get
carefree smooth buttery gameplay whether
you're pairing this up with maybe an RX
580 if you want some to the bill amount
or first Vega once that's available and
finally here is an RG Strix notebook
write our district notebook
what do you guys think of it you're
probably going to be more interested as
to what is inside this Argos trick
notebook it is the first ever rise in
notebook and a Foose has managed to
wedge a r7 1708 core processor in here
as well as an AMD rx 580 it is a four
gig arc 580 but this is going to be
available for between 1300 and $1500
depending on what configuration you get
with like SSD supported memory and that
kind of thing but yeah they said they're
also going to be doing a r5 1600 version
of this as well so for those you guys
have been looking for AMD to get back
into a viable option and the notebook
category this appears to be the
beginning I thought it was going to come
with the rise and 315 but it's great to
see them able to fit something like an
r7 1700 with that many cores in
something that is relatively thin I mean
it's not the sloths notebook you've ever
seen but it is definitely portable and
with all those scores in there I'd be
very nice and powerful to the great
great road editing system I would
imagine okay I can wrap it up for my
coverage of the a through smooth here
comes effects 2017 I want to say huge
taken by sponsors for my coverage
