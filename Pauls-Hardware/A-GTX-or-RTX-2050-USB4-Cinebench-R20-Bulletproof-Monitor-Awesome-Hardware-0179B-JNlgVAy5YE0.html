charmagne where's this your man the
bottom on the bottom shelf it and I got
a Jeff you've got to blast it right in
your eye Kyle hello hello everyone I
really I sure hope I'm doing things
properly right now because I could
easily be screwing things up but hi guys
welcome this is awesome hardware and we
should hopefully be live to youtube on
my channel paul's hardware a lot more
switches to yeah that's that's right
okay yeah we're live cool
this is double-checking good if you
can't tell by the little counter thats
that's down there down there in the
bottom of corner i am on the cusp a
paint of hitting 1 million subscribers
and somehow after run it doing my
youtube channel for years and years this
is happening to occur on a tuesday
evening coinciding with us doing our
live show which is I just think it's
super special it is pretty awesome super
special we're at 999 9:57 as of right
now but let me quickly do the rest of
the intro to our show this is awesome
hardware it's a live show we stream to
twitch TV / awesome hardware the entire
show but we also stream to YouTube
twitch that YouTube video and my channel
balls hardware it for faces episode
number 179 and the dogs are gonna start
barking in just a second just a warning
for headphone users but this is episode
179 we stream every Tuesday evening at
5:30 p.m. Pacific time and we also have
stores if you want to help support us do
it I mean thank you all for supporting
us as you have with with the
subscriptions and everything but my
story is false I read that net you can
buy stuff there Kyle store is bit wit
tech slash store
you can also buy stuff there well thank
you by shouting at your name and yelling
Johnson during the after party was just
coming later where we're gonna play apex
legends
that's gonna be super awesome great time
to buy the beware of bottleneck shirt oh
yeah yeah this is it's coming up right
now because Kyle's got the shimei ready
to go the exact same bottle we are
celebrating prematurely okay okay oh
yeah yep got no blood has briefed that
is brief it's fine my lovely wife has
returned home yay
all right what's next what what's going
on i I'm allowed to stop thinking dang
it hello is my wife and he's only 30
subs away and soon 30 yet nine hundred
ninety nine thousand nine hundred and
sixty nine thirty so let's just keep it
at 69 a nice haha alright
what am i the hell's going on just four
oh wow all right I I just have a news
segment for my half I'm gonna try to
crank through the news it's giddy well
there's there's news no you can get
through like one or two I'm gonna do it
right now
stuff for news notebook check do it del
might have accidentally just leaked
either an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 2050 or and
Archie X 2050 this is actually reporter
this is actually reported by a reader
from the notebook check net website who
was looking at details of this upcoming
del G 515 gaming laptop 15-inch g5 found
that if you there's a little asterisk
down here so it's talking about the
ports and slots on there the number nine
listed thing here is USB C display port
slash USB C Thunderbolt and there's a
little asterisk you know if you click on
the asterisk this is a little pop-up it
says oh and it will be on says the USB
see thunder bowl will be on systems that
are KX 2060 then display part will be on
systems with in RTX 2015 nailed it
RTX 2015 you're fired has not been
anounced to anything so there's multiple
possibilities here one of course being
that you know that it was a typo they
just they meant to put gtx 1050 TI or
something like that probably not because
they were talking about next-gen laptops
there's also of course possibility that
this does exist and that they had the
information and it was just a web page
that wasn't updated properly 17 to go I
know 17 it's alright oh no here's team
to go here's the dog here oh he's he's
so happy right now he just he probably
just went potty okay so it would be kind
of interesting to see an RT X 2050
tensor course for ray tracing and stuff
like that like what like should that be
a thing should that exist
you're so distracting right now talk
about important i'm news this is news
worthy information i'm only twisting the
the thing the the foil with every sub 11
to go 1100 that's insane
it's a twist oh oh oh someone unsub's I
got a twisting to do with that I'm
tightening it I'm tightening it when it
pops off what are you gonna do I'm gonna
scream and run and get to pound the rest
of your beer in there and of course I'm
totally fine this is this is intense
this is intense beer we it's going down
it's going down alright awesome people
I'm tightening the model this is I'm
tightening it back yeah we have enough
time now to get to get to the story then
okay perfect speculation that they might
take the 1660 TI the the gtx 660ti
rebrand it as a mobile GPU as an RT x
2050 you know the the the the
protections off this is 994 oh wow Kyle
you're gonna be hammered alright it went
back down I went back down that's fine
it's all mines laughs wait no it's gonna
hit a million a second to a million
sixty okay I didn't wine myself either
what the heck is going on cheers to a
million cheers rock that's this amazing
shit
a million I'm gonna pound I'm gonna
pound this celebrate a million dude
resistant you're in the seven-digit Club
bro dude chat whoa dude chat oh my
goodness up top two million fifty three
moving in 7400 it took Fred I don't know
like ten subscribers and now it's all of
a sudden 100 more holy shit oh how that
works good lord
yay yeah fuckin ceiling I may have some
with it you go then that's just amazing
feels good Kahn's palette all right
I love now if I poured too much in mind
I'll give you some now you're fine okay
fine
good what so what where'd you leave off
I don't care about this news yeah who
cares don't worry no one's even like Oh
get to the next point is this is a this
is a monumental achievement this is this
is truly something that is historic and
that I think people will remember
probably for the rest of their lives
everyone watching this right now you
know they're gonna know we're they
they're gonna their kids will ask them
to tell them stories where were you when
when Paul hit a million subscribers and
everything the biggest thing since 9/11
I mean it's it's it's the type of thing
that hasn't really happened before
there's nothing comparable to this that
has happened in the past that you could
look back on and say that's a similar
thing that's happened that you can't do
that it's just it's just this right now
and it's the bits the best thing ever
and that's all for me as well as I made
I mean I made my wife laughs okay all
right so obviously you know being
facetious there cuz Cowell already hit a
million this cycled news for him i but
now what so what but now I need to ask
me ask you see cuz you you know you've
been down this path before like what
what happens now what would you know
there's gonna be this like crazy high
but then like tomorrow am I gonna wake
up and be like what is my life what I do
with my life now uh it's kind of like I
move past this it's kind of like when
you know when you're a kid and you have
like you know $99 to your name and then
you get a hundred and you're like whoa I
have triple digit money now that's what
it's like I remember that so remember
that feeling that lasted for all of
maybe an hour or so and then you know
it's you know you hit it and you're like
that was that's that that's an app I
don't want to add on a downplay it I
don't know them I don't want to play it
down everyone I have one hour to like
feel good why not hey one hour of prx2
sears unbridle is like fifty dog years
oh oh well I'm I'm happy about that but
I know the wife is potentially sounds
amazing
alright well um but yeah I'm gonna press
on with with the show as planned I did
plant I do have some news stories to
talk about you this is an unprecedented
and actually was unexpected I was kind
of thinking we would get close this
evening and then kind of let let things
go with with a thank you and you know
tomorrow hopefully wake up with a
million but yeah it's really really cool
to have this happen and I'll also
coincide with our live show yeah which
is crazy crazy timing almost have a
thousand viewers on Twitch right now
live that's beautiful
amazing twitch to twitch on the youtubes
May's balls and everything how do i how
do I get back on track now wait how many
viewers do you have on your chip I don't
I don't I don't know Kyle I don't the
after party I don't pay attention to
just the numbers you know dollars 15 our
viewers watching you right now 15 in
YouTube which that's a they equate to
dollars every viewer is yeah this is a
dollar everyone donate $1 right now to
Paul if all 1500 of you just donated $1
just to say congrats he would be a
thousandaire just like a millionaire
[Laughter]
focus all right things that really
matter 15 not life goals or achievements
or years and years of hard work and
dedication but a leaked graphics card so
upshot here's this is this is this is a
rumor it could easily been a typo it
could be fake but at the same time we
know NVIDIA is working on lower-end
graphics cards if you're talking about
their next generation of GPU
architecture the entry-level price right
now is for the 1660 TI which is two
hundred and eighty dollars that's that's
been coming down it was $500 for the
2070 when the 2070 in 2080 and 2080 I
lodged it came down to 350 with 2060
now it's 280 there's people who still
can't who to 80 is still too rich for
their blood which perfectly
understandable sure something in the
hundred to two hundred dollar range
would be nice to have yep fair to assume
Nvidia is gonna do that are they going
to make an Archie X card in that range I
hope not I really hope not I hope they
don't make an art GX card in that range
because based on the reception of the
existing RT x cards I don't think people
are interested in
some crazy premium especially at the
lower end what for ray tracing and you
know DL SS stuff like this there's
there's there's value in advancing those
technologies in the future but for
people who are just looking for a good
gaming experience that's that's not what
they want yeah
I also hope they don't continue to
further like confuse the the the the
naming conventions for the cards that
they're doing in particular I hope they
don't try to take a 1660 TI and rebadge
it as an RT x 2050 for mobile that is
really confusing when you start crossing
over from that 1600 series that they now
created somehow with the 1660 TI and the
2000 series that they have at the RT x
like keep those separate yeah cuz once
they start bleeding into each other it's
just gonna be more confusing and people
are gonna get more irritated by yeah
maybe that's what they want maybe they
want to sow confusion so people like
spend more money for a crappy or
graphics card or something but that's
also stupid and we will continue to call
it stupid and you guys listen to us
we'll hopefully agree with that and that
and then eventually things will get
better that's how that's how it's
supposed to work
okay you know moving on we talked last
week we yeah last week we talked about
the USB and USB 3.0 and how stupid the
USB 3.2 thing is because the way the
naming things and retconning names and
everything so how about throwing one
more thing into the into it USB for this
is a specification it has been announced
so whereas USB 3.2 gen 2 by 2 is
something that is like coming out this
is an announcement some basic details of
the specification but not the full
details of the spec and this was
announced by the USB promoter group and
they're calling it USB for and for some
reason there's no more space
space yeah there's no space anymore
space for what between USB and for its
USB for that USB 3.0 sp3 point 2.0 three
points either three days three USB and
then I can highlight right there see I
just highlighted that space ah oh space
three point two right yes before is just
war yes before use people use it was no
delay no hesitation way you have to
movie from the B to the for immediately
and without hesitation again further
clarify it's us before us of us before
that's before before us before what
that's before them that's before us
that's before us before from like ub40
or ub40 is that like me what a gangsta
says to some 40 year old you'll be 40
holy shit you old you we fed red red
wine has not read right ub40 what is you
before do you leave where's that written
reference to yes I'm right about that
what's you before tea though any groups
the groups names you before the song is
red red wine
everyone hit wonder have they done
anything else that I would know probably
at any one no okay yeah so I don't know
who they are era we're getting slightly
it's a good one-hit wonder off subject
it's a good song I mean if you're like
super wasted like that's a great college
yeah like when you when you're out
drinking you know yeah yeah drinking
college and stuff and then they put that
on like red red wine or like
Margaritaville and they play those and
you're like oh or tequila
that's right yeah I mean if you do that
that just makes you feel cool yeah kind
of dance longer played copyrighted songs
on Twitter
yeah be awesome we can just dance drink
dance the sing drink tequila so us
before us before that's before is
actually gonna be based on Intel
Thunderbolt protocol which is kind of
interesting so more confusing but but
confusing okay
don't immediately cast that aside as
confusing by using Intel Thunderbolt
protocol they're able to get faster
transfer speeds so we updated transfer
rates at 40 gigabits per second is here
why are you feeding my dog bottlecaps
No Oh No zero stop it that's not a treat
stop speaking my dog bottle yeah boy
come here come here come here
he's needy so big he's needy is it big
puppy he's not a puppy he's monster he's
a puppy
he's monster parents both of us so we're
talking about ub40 you be phoning and
their hit song red red wine what that's
the fastest band alive 20 gigabits per
second
Oh yesa QB 40 right the 40 gigabit per
second no 40 okay obviously that was a
planned transition okay you be 40
gigabits per second hot dance because
what the band said when they were
recording the red red wine we need to
push through this so we can get to the
after-party where this sort of behavior
is acceptable this is constipation
episode we're going to push but it's
just not coming out exactly exactly
okay so us before I yes before I have
some level of hope for us before because
right now it's just called us before
which is much simpler than USB 3.2 Gen 2
by 2 which is what we're currently
running with when we talk about the
fastest thing available with this the
spec that we talked about last week
oh no I didn't do that
that's stupid
keep calling it so keep calling it yes
before don't add a bunch of stupid names
after that a USB promoter group and your
word sir let's go over it all right just
just to round things out and give people
some actual information it's still going
to be using type-c connectors yay
it will still so the type-c connectors
will be backwards compatible with USB
2.0 USB 3.2 and Thunderbolt 3 interfaces
so that's cool to that maximum data
transfer rate of 40 gigabits per second
will require 40 gigabits per second
certified cables this should however
bring Thunderbolt 3 to mainstream pcs
which is cool because Thunderbolt is a
very fast and good connection standard
for really fast external drives like
Thunderbolt like there's a lot of Mac
external Thunderbolt drives that that
are really nice and fast like external
SSDs so mm-hmm it's a good standard cool
I think
Danah is stirring the ball for for nori
there are over 50 companies actively
participating in the final stages of
development of USB for let's move on
cool
that's fun and confusing Gebo is
shutting down
saying goodbye to Gebo good thing with
vias fuck
fullscreen took up too much space
that's stupid ease is social robot he's
a social robot he talks to you and
everything however with no friends he's
shutting down the servers that support
Gebo are shutting down so if you have
one he's starting to communicate sad
messages to you well it's not great news
the servers out there that let me do
what I do are going to be turned off
soon somebody says yes this is what Jibo
has been telling people who bought geo
quoting gee but by the way
geebo I was a Kickstarter or at
IndieGoGo in 2014 and 2015 right around
that time frame actually went on sale in
September of 2017 a few years later and
was originally sold for $900 damn but
they had like an Amazon fire sale
forward for 500 bucks and so what a
bargain yes
anyways that's not great news the
server's out there that let me do what I
do are we going to be turned off soon
once that happens our interactions with
each other are going to be limited you
can learn more about more Zeebo calm and
by tapping me what's new button in my
menu I want to say that I've really
enjoyed our time together thank you very
very much for having me around maybe
someday when robots are way more
advanced than today and everyone has
then them in their homes
you can tell yours I said hello I wonder
if they'll be able to do this and then
advances because that's one of the
things that Cuba does is it dances oh
yeah I forgot I forgot GMO dances to
distract you that you just bought a five
to five hundred to a thousand dollar
product that no longer is getting
support just so that's still you can
still do stuff like here damn thing I
would be pissed
going down $1000 Jibo and he's like
thanks but bye see you later
we live in an age where products that
you've bought and spent your hard-earned
dollars for can tell you to fuck off but
but when they do a little dancing chica
did-ent so it's okay so that's you devos
usefulness and functionality were sort
of supplanted by other devices like LexA
yeah so it's saying goodbye to people
there was another video I was gonna plan
here that actually was was the geebo and
it was it was telling it was like hey
hey person who bought me and who owns me
now here's what I can do now and it was
a really short list
and I don't know when dance and I can
stop anything and I could say your name
sir rip Cibo no warrants no archivo and
yugioh fucka in the land of the living
in actual people good old games or now
known as GOG yeah I was laid off around
a dozen employees ooh which is about 10%
of its actual staff now 120 people
yeah and God GOG is a digital distribute
distribution platform they listed in the
50 to 200 employee category range on
LinkedIn anyway
GOG is is is not a bad distribution
platform and it's one of those that over
the years has exhibited some positive
characteristics I would say compared to
like steam and whatnot so I bring this
up to say not like go through your money
at gog but you know consider them as an
alternative they're stating that's part
of the reason here no I'm sorry gog
themselves has not stated that anything
is wrong they said it they said yeah we
laid these employees off but ever since
we've been doing a rearranging they're
calling it rearranging what did they
call it when we were back back at the
company company we used to work it
they call it re re fuckery
reorganization I forget anyway corporate
stuff you know that I go we need to fire
people so let's come up with some words
that don't sound like firing that we can
use to fire people episode of the office
point being
they've been rearranging certain reorge
yeah ryoga's is common thanks Jeff we've
been rearranging certain teams since
October 2018 affecting and closing
around a dozen positions last week they
also said that they've hired people in
the same term so you know there's give
and take there but at least one of the
employees who was let go contacted
PC gamer at least in the course of this
article being written stating that the
reasons they were told they were let go
was due to financial difficulties
so you know GOG might might be having
some financial troubles at this point
we're not sure of course that's the word
of an employee who was recently let go
but again when you let go you're at
liberty to say why are you firing me and
you know if they like it use you suck at
your job you might be like alright fair
enough
but sometimes like we can't afford to
pay you any more than that is financial
difficulties anyway the trend toward a
greater revenue share for developers
when it comes to these digital
distribution platforms the epic game
store for example offers 88% of revenue
to developers which is nice developers
should get a good cut that's compared to
the 70% that's offered by Gog and steam
put pressure on God's bottom line so
there you go Wow you know gog was a very
it was kind of like the under well it
still is the underdog but it was
actually a efficient enough underdog a
popular enough one to potentially combat
steam and I feel like in recent months
it hasn't been doing is great and after
this latest article that you've just
mentioned Paul it seems like they might
be losing steam well I always liked
because you know they used to be good
old game good old games so they would
take they would take older games that
were on older platforms or you know
versions of Windows that weren't around
anymore and they would say like alright
this game nobody plays this game anymore
because it's impractical to to play it
yeah let's see if we can on the cheap
get the license for this game poured it
into our platform you know takes get get
some get some programmers to go and port
it over so people who use modern modern
operating systems can play it and then
we can sell the games you know people
are willing to pay two bucks or five
bucks for a game
I used to play at 10 or 15 years ago
that they want to try out again and they
just want a seamless experience to play
the game you know on their modern modern
operating system so that I think that's
kind of the business model that they
started with it's evolved beyond that so
it is a distribution platform for more
games than that now but I think just in
a general sense it's good to have
competition for the likes of steam and
origin and epic with their launcher now
and everything so this being a company
that spurts I think we're kind of came
from a good place I think for me at
least I have a bit more sympathy so you
know go make your gog accountant buy a
game if you're feeling that way anyway
move on
moving on Cinebench neck here in chat
said Hiro is snoring this means this
discussion must end and he is no longer
me he's over he's McGee's know what he's
doing is good eating stuff he's feeding
stuff I don't know bottle caps
there's no my wife might have given him
a snack or something okay Cinebench are
twenty Kyle you better download this I
already have really no oh all right so
Sena bitch right max son is the company
that develops cinema ch excuse me yep
Cinebench r15 you guys have probably
seen if you've watched any videos that
we or excuse me
or other text use or other tech
youtubers have done when you're talking
about benchmarking and cpu our 20s it's
a very very common CPU benchmark that's
used but was getting more and more out
of date because Cinebench r15 was
released alongside version 15 of cinema
4d which is the software that it's based
on that it uses to render the scene as
your that it uses to test how fast your
CPU can render that scene
Maxon in the meantime has moved on from
version 15 to 16 17 18 19 and 20 of
their software so now we have Cinebench
our 20 long
to line up with with present-day version
of the software there you look at that
Wow
this is now the scene that you'll
probably see rendered ad nauseam that
looks like a real picture it does look
it does look very realistic that's crazy
that video games will one day look like
this and it's because you know it's
using the CPU to render rate to do rate
race I mean VR will of a light source
and it bouncing up you'll be able to run
this off your phone objects and
everything and it'll load that good
course yeah with the foldable glass LCD
screen folding glass fucking crazy it's
awesome ready player one so yeah this is
available right now through the Windows
Store or the Apple App Store on Macs
you can run it on either platform if
you're like ah the Windows Store that's
lame booooo I kind of agree with you but
there are some benefits to using the
Windows Store when it comes to stuff
like sandboxing and whatnot
but at least as of now it doesn't seem
like there is a just standalone
installer version of this so there there
it is but it is at least free to
download and try apps they've added AVX
instructions to its which is implemented
through Intel's Embree ray tracing
technology that applies to both AMD and
Intel processors by the way so that's
not something that's exclusive to Intel
and this is a purely CPU focused test
since the GPU focused test on the
previous version was never something
that was really used anyway they've just
been like alright we're not even gonna
bother with that CPU only it also scales
beyond 64 threads now and is a larger
scene in general so I have not
downloaded this and ran it yet either
but the article which is from an antic
you has some scores for various CPUs
which you guys can check out if you want
you know like a 1700 X 8 core from rat
the Rison gets three thousand four
hundred fifty-five points eight seventy
seven hundred K which is only a fork or
a three gets two thousand four hundred
and twenty points these are the preload
scores by the way that the the benchmark
ships with there's also some single core
numbers here they different scores than
what our 15 would put out yes it's a
different test okay
but you know when whenever you load up
ar-15 and you run the test and it pops
up to your score it always has those
comparison whores right this is the
precess is just the default presets you
know they made the test they ran it on
these CPUs they loaded with they loaded
it with those by default I always wish
they had more options they have like if
you if you want to get fancy you can
save the father's it saves like your
test results oh yeah I know you can copy
that from the system the system and then
you can see all your history of test
results in there too sure I know they
did that for you me too that would be
nice okay movie on man
MSI monitors could save your life
hmm oh this is interests that perhaps
perhaps a slight exaggeration I mean
this tweet actually was shared by anshel
really our friend and so that's how I
can travel but this is Eric again or
Eric gain 98 on Twitter who posted this
and he unfortunately had a shooting in
his neighborhood which which sucks like
like in a first-person shooter no like
there was a shooting in his neighborhood
that he just was oh no there's now
bullets coming through my wall what's
like this hole right there behind him
it's it apparently was a party that was
going on so like you know really really
stupid people firing a gun random shots
at a party yeah fire so that sucks
the point being yeah there's the cops
outside and everything it's real when
the cops are there but the point being
this is his MSI monitor it took a bullet
took a bullet from this shooting and
survived was he gaming on it at the time
that's not made clear that was he just
got shot by a random stranger MSI
monitor guy
hit how immersive lot the bullet and
still functioning look at that it's a
bullet hole in the wall aah monitor
still looking perfect amazing
hell yeah and if he was gaming on it
while it happened I would be super that
would be even more impressive he said
there's a total of five shots and his
and his friends room that's a feature
which sucks but I am I mean I'm glad no
one got he updated that there were
random shots and there was a party it
was a 4 a.m. orgy bullet so yeah it came
through the wall and however though
however MSI got interrupted
it said nice to meet you social media
manager got in touch basically they said
they'd love to send you a new monitor
and some swag that's nice so even though
these msi monitor took the bullet and is
still functional MSI's like hey we're
gonna send you a new one we don't want
you to have to deal with that monitoring
with the bullet in the back but I'm
gonna guess that Eric here is now gonna
be rockin probably a dual monitor setup
you know the one that took the bullet
and still works just fine and the other
side's gonna send over good job ms:i way
to be on top of that social media and I
warned mark this is this is where the
bullet actually penetrated the monitor
doesn't say what gun it was I do not
believe that is made clear what's this
oh yeah fans is like they rate the
bullet came in and ricocheted hit the
fan and stuff like that Shh this is a
great samuel change it agree
okay so MSN monitors they will save your
life save could possibly save your life
it's and the main dangers now okay
Kevlar technology one more thing to
mention here Kyle huh you talked on your
half of the show I believe about Apex
legends oh yeah stop yawning I'm not
just cuz you pounded that beer I'm not
no you talked about more beard how
quickly apex Legends has gained players
here is a this is from around Hill
investments incidentally this is also
from Asheville
anshel I don't know if you you probably
don't want our show but if you do don't
you
good job on your 5g coverage anyway here
is apex legends versus for tonight for
tonight is the green line here there's
apex legends just in case you wanted a
visual representation of how quickly
apex Legends has gained popularity in
particular in comparison to fortnight
the one thing that I'm kind of sad about
here is that there's no come there's no
central aggregator of gaming popularity
right right look it's like on Steam
trusted source when steam was the only
real game in town when it came to PC
gaming steam was the game
I mean when steam was the only real like
thing that people were using to play PC
games yeah
which but never really was the case cuz
you had World of Warcraft and other
stuff like that but you know you could
kind of go and that one central place
and be like all right what's the most
popular game all right this new game has
come up there was a there was a machine
I saw earlier this week that was just
the history like the last 10 years of
steam and like the most popular games on
Steam it was basically dota 2 the whole
time with other games kind of coming
coming up here and there but anyway
point me like fortnight apex legends
they're on different platforms so you
can't really look at that and be like
right right
for apex legends picking up this much
popularity this quickly fortnight you'd
have to assume is is some has seen some
players leave but anyway at direct
comparison I think would be interesting
to see yeah
but of course we can't do that and you
know that figure right there that 200
million for a fortnight includes mobile
all the mobile downloads and games yes
whereas apex is strictly on one platform
PC and 49 exigence is also on console
I'm sorry fortnight is I'm sorry apex is
that that number that figure accounts
for the three platforms Xbox ps4
PC whereas fortnight all the figures
you're seeing here account for the
mobile version of it as well yes the
mobile version does give many many more
players access many many more so there
you go many many but there it is that's
