they do hello everyone welcome to Paul's
hardware this is my monthly builds video
for August 2015 and I'm going to call
this the skylight condition I know it's
a little bit late it's actually August
13th now but I wanted to wait until the
skylake processors were out because I
wanted to do builds based on the skylake
processors another question you guys
might have is what about those July a
builds that you also did all because you
said you were gonna build one I am still
gonna build one I'm gonna build the x99
entry level system I have all the parts
for that skylight kind of push that back
a little bit but like I said in that
video even if you're building on x99
right now and even though skylight came
out in the interim x99 still like the
high level dizziest platform and it's
still a very very good way to go but for
today's video I have two builds to share
with you guys one of them is the $1,000
balanced build that was actually
requested by y'all last month so I
posted this draw poll a bunch of people
responded thanks to all you guys who
voted and as you can see at the top
there is the all-rounder 800 $2,000
multi-purpose build so I went for it
dollars and then also on this list we
had some other we had votes for other
things the other build I'm doing is more
of a high-end gaming build so I guess
you could kind of say you guys voted for
that one as well and since these are
skylake builds it just kind of makes
sense that I'm using the two new skylake
processors to base them off of so these
6600 K which is about $250 right now and
the 6700 K which is about 350 dollars
right now so with that all said let's go
ahead and dive in but actually no no no
let's not dive in yet
let's also share with you guys in chat
and whatnot the straw poll for this
month so you guys can already start
voting on that and feel free to do so
what kind of systems builds do you wanna
see for September I kept some of the
ones I'm from last month such as the
mini ITX overkill system I did a 4k
gaming system for $440,000 which might
be interesting and that would be
including monitor and peripherals do
another console killer try to redeem
myself there video editing system silent
or fanless HT PC or a really really
cheap system similar to the one that
Kyle recently built so those are your
options they are feel free to vote if
you're watching this on youtube links to
all this stuff is down in the
description but let's get started I'm
using PC part picker for these builds as
I have been continuing to do because
it's a great website to put together
builds and kind of get low prices on
things so this is the more expensive
build this is the route right about two
thousand dollar price points this one's
based on the 6700 K and I went ahead and
threw a gtx 980ti in there as well for
the graphics card so 67 okay we're gonna
NZXT Crake Crake in or kraken however
you want to pronounce that X 61 gigabyte
z170 ex-gay mning motherboard Corsair
Vengeance memory of course our Neutron
XT SSD and EVGA geforce gtx 980ti 68
video card NZXT Noctis 450 and of course
850 watt power supply this build is
another build that I'm also going to be
building and I said that last month but
what you guys have looking forward to
very soon so you should make sure to
subscribe to my channel is like
back-to-back builds I'm gonna do the
this skylight build and then I'm also
going to be doing the other build from
last month the x99 entry-level build
mate maybe I'll like pit them against
each other or something but let's run
down the parts of course the 6700k
processor this is the new skylake good
it's actually on sale now three 360 at
NCIX but it should be around three 350
360 bucks it's a really good processor
for my testing so far you can get decent
overclocks on at four point six two 4.8
gigahertz you do need a cooler for it so
that's why we got the in sixty NZXT
Kraken X 61 which is a nice big 280
millimeter all-in-one liquid cooler for
men's ext in that pairs of nicely with
the case weight I wanted to show the
case next right the case go ah there's
the case they have too many tabs and
they're all tiny there's a case which is
the NZXT Noctis 450 so this is the kind
of these successors sort of to the NZXT
h 440 and i never actually built in the
h 440 although it did get many many good
reviews and feedbacks and all that good
stuff so I'm gonna build in this one now
and this one's cool it's got like ground
effect lighting and stuff like that just
kind of kind of pretty cool so we'll be
taking a look at this one and you know a
nice big side panel window and all that
good stuff and this is what is it 140
but I think you can actually get it for
as cheapest whereas where'd that go ah
138 well 130 on Newegg if you get an
instant rebate
alright so apart from the case CPU CPU
cooler we also have this gigabytes z170
X gaming 7 motherboard this is kind of
this is kind of a black white and red
build all together so so that's how that
went
I guess and this motherboard actually so
the motherboard I'm using in the build
is about $220 right now the motherboard
I'm actually gonna build with is this
one and I'm actually I'm actually not
even sure yet this is gonna fit because
this is an e 2e ATX board and I don't
know if it'll fit in that case if it
doesn't then I'll probably end up just
sitting up gigabyte and seeing if I can
get to gaming 7 because this one is like
the flagship z170 board from gigabyte
and it's 500 freakin dollars which is
cool for some people but that's pretty
expensive also for the memory for this
build I'm using some Corsair Vengeance
lpx series
ddr4 so this is a 2 by 8 gig kit and I
and I can show you the pricing and
whatnot for that - theoretically I like
this kit because it's nice low profile
black ones in 2666 beats a decent little
overclock not that memory overclocking
gets you a whole lot of extra
performance but it's gonna do a good job
and it's 2 by 8 gigs which means you
have upgrade potential I always like
having upgrade potential so the two by
eight gigs will allow you to add two
more sticks of the future if you wanted
to update it to 32 we also have of
course our Neutron XT SSD for an 80 gig
you might notice that I don't really do
a whole lot of like like hard drives and
builds these days and there's a specific
reason for that it's because I think for
your money the SSD is more important
that's gonna get you more performance
out of the gate and I think most all of
us have an old hard drive lying around a
1 or 2 terabyte you know hard drive that
we don't use anymore or carrying it over
from an older system or grab that hard
drive that we talked about on the on the
live show the other day which is like 50
bucks for a 2 terabyte because it's
really not that much money but I prefer
to have that flexibility when it comes
to it but as far as the SSD itself this
Neutron XT has gotten amazingly good
reviews it's a 480 gig so it's gonna
give you plenty of room for us and lots
of games and apps and stuff so happy
with that one the video card has already
mentioned as a gtx 980ti
I chose the generic one here because I
have one so that's what I'm gonna put in
the build this is also kind of a
diplomatic choice because there's so
many 980ti is out there in different
variants and I have the EVGA one but it
wouldn't really match with this build as
much so I'm just going to go ahead and
use this one and if you guys are
actually putting the system together go
ahead and you know pick your poison as
far as other 980ti czar that are out
there because there's a bunch of really
good examples okay power supply is of
course there are m8 50 i this is a brand
new power supply course they're just
announced this series at Computex and
actually available in the market now
these are 80 plus gold they're fully
modular they're they're very nice units
they're black and white which is going
to blend in with a lot of a lot of
different system builds and I like that
all the modular cables as you probably
can't tell too well here are all black
as well so those are going to blend in
and and match and not gonna get the
nasty different-colored cable thing
going on
oh wait I'm skipping forward so yeah
that's that's my that's my $2,000 sky
like 6700 K build and I think this one's
gonna be a beast and as mentioned I'm
out I'm gonna be putting this together
so stay tuned for that one coming in the
future next up is the thousand dollar
all-around build and when it comes to an
all-around build I guess I would ask the
question what do you mean like buy an
all-around build well basically I'm
looking for something that's just not
specifically aimed at like gaming
although gaming is obviously going to be
a very key thing that you do with this
system but it means that you're looking
for a more powerful CPU for example
you're not necessarily going to go for a
more budget oriented CPU because you're
going to want to be able to do other
things with it besides just game and
often you can get away with the lower
end CPU if all you're doing is gaming
it also means I'm going for a slightly
more powerful GPU and then it also means
that I want to have again as I usually
do with builds lots of upgrade potential
I want to be able to add things on to
this to make it do other things and just
what it can do out of the box and if it
wasn't already obvious by everything
I've already said we're starting out
with the 6600 K for the base level CPU
for this build so there's a whole build
together oh look the price went down
I built this all last night and it was
999 dollars and I was like perfect just
under $1,000 so then this morning I
looked and it was a thousand twenty
dollars because the prices they change
all the time but now by the time the
video started I think this is thanks to
a couple mil and rebates that got
applied oh the price of the power supply
dropped down it's down under a thousand
again so 996 here also got a 6600 K a
hyper 212 Evo an MSI z170a crate
motherboard a data 2x4 gig memory kit
SanDisk 240 GB SSD and Asus GTX 970
graphics card NZXT s340 case and an EVGA
500 watt power supply so let's kind of
rundown each of these little components
here and we'll talk a little bit about
each one 6600 K obviously goes without
saying this is overclockable case q
quad-core no hyper threading but a very
good processor I actually have one of
these on the way so I'm going to be
doing some 6600 k testing very soon and
apart from that it doesn't
with a power supply with a CPU cooler so
there's a cooler master hyper 212 which
is kind of my go-to defaults because
it's like 25 30 bucks does a really good
job cooling and it's 25 or 30 bucks i
kenneth i was scouring around because i
actually put some thought into the the
aesthetics and the look of this build
and I wanted something I wanted like
something that looks a little bit nicer
because I have 4 to 12 it's just you
know it's got the bare aluminum and
copper you might consider this inner max
I know I talk about the inner max ETS T
40 and I've used a black one a couple
times I just feel like it's the best
like as far as a good-looking cooler
that is available in a couple colors
white and black does a really good job
cooling as well it's only like 10 15
dollars more than a hyper 212 although
they seem to be harder to find these
days so anyway keep an eye out for that
one if the hyper 212 isn't your cup of
tea or you want to make things look a
bit prettier moving on to the graphics
card this is a geforce gtx 970 and maybe
some of you are looking at that this
video right now is and scowling and
saying pol why are you putting a 1970 in
this build well I have an answer for you
I'm gonna come back to it in just a
moment but this I thought was a unique
little card from Asus you don't see non
reference cards that actually have
blower style style coolers very often so
I kind of like the look at this card if
if you're doing a specialty build and
when I chose it I kind of based some of
the other aesthetics of the system
around this one so that's why I went for
example with the white NZXT s340 case
which is right here I hope I can mouse
over this stuff cuz this is some weird
then I got some weird stuff going on ya
see it doesn't work doesn't work with it
used to anyway s340 this is like
hardware connects gave this like a best
value or bang for the buck something
like that award it's like you can get
this as cheap as like 55 dollars
sometimes when it's on sale ATX case
fits everything in there nice and easy
and it's available in black or whites
and I chose the white one here because
it's like black it's it's again kind of
black white and red I guess this is a
theme with a lot of my builds that's why
also for the motherboard I went with
this MSI z170a crate which is black and
whites and a little bit of red and will
blend in beautifully
I like this board because it's a it's
got your z170 features it's got all kind
of the
the base level z170 features that you
would want only hundred fifty bucks and
a very nice look to the board as well I
like what MSI has done with a lot of
their crate series motherboards for
memory I was looking for some white
memory couldn't really find much ddr4
that was White's
look for black and I was just it was
kind of played out so I was like oh well
we got black white and red going on here
why don't we do some accent with the xpg
from a data nice black PCBs red heat
spreaders and I think as an accent color
in this bill that would look nice of
course if you don't want this specific
memory it's really easy to swap out a
different two by four gigabyte kit
that's the main point here is you want a
two by four gig kit which will kind of
get you in there on the ddr4 train dual
channel not a whole lot of money and
then gives you a couple of upgrade slots
again in the future to add more memory
in a day that has apparently a large
robot that uses its memory as wings
that's been fantastic
alright SSD as mentioned I'm gonna I
gotta go with an SSD for this so this is
a SanDisk 240 gig this is their SSD plus
slightly older it's not quite as fast as
the brand-new ones but honestly for a
240 gig SSD it's really fast $78 and
it's black and red and it matches as
well
I like SanDisk's SSDs because they
actually manufacture than and I think
they didn't and pretty sure they do than
and and I think this one might have a
SandForce controller in it but that's
still okay and then for the power supply
with the EVGA 500 B this is an 80 plus
bronze 500 watt power supply which has
more than enough juice for a 970 based
system but going back to those of you
who might have looked at this build and
thought Paul why did you go with the 970
you can get more performance for your
dollar for $1000 system and I would say
yes and that's why you guys get a bonus
build right yeah for bonus builds it hit
the like button if you want a bonus wait
hit the like button if you enjoyed bonus
builds or if you liked the video I guess
this is a thousand dollar all-rounder
very very similar configuration to the
one I just showed you however this one
I've swapped out just a few parts in
order to give us an AMD based graphics
card instead of an Nvidia based graphics
card and that is the msi r9 398 gig and
actually ended up swapping out three
pieces for this slightly altered build
because we have an r9 390 which uses
decently a decent amount more power a
good hundred watts more than what you
need for a 970 so with this we also have
an upgraded power supply wait wait there
it is the EVGA 600v and actually if
you're looking at the other the nvidia
base one you might just go ahead and get
this power supply as well because it was
it was as cheap as 50 bucks is only like
five or eight dollars more than the 500
watt version and it's got pretty much
all the same features and everything
very solid power supplies from EVGA yeah
it's a it's an it's nice that they have
had those coming in at a pretty low
price they're partially modular and then
for this one since we didn't have that
white 970 from Asus I went for the black
version of the S 340 so you could swap
that out as well so three different
parts there and you end up coming in wow
the price is actually also dropped on
this last night this was about a
thousand twenty and now it's a thousand
one thousand 187 so still coming in at
just about the same price point main
difference with AMD side is you're going
to be using more power so it's not going
to be as efficient but you're gonna get
a decent boost when it comes to like
frame rate and everything and the the r9
390 has eight gigs of gddr5 memory
whereas the GTX 970 has 3.5 gigs
well it's got four gigs but 3.5 they're
good and then the rest is yeah yeah
we've already we've all discussed the
GTX 970 thing in the past so there we go
that is my two builds actually two plus
one build since I did a double build for
the thousand dollar system I hope you
guys have enjoyed this but I'm always
looking for your feedback so post in the
comments and let me know what you
thought of these builds always looking
for like alternates are variants or like
hey I did the same price point with a
few other part swapped out and maybe a
little bit more performance I was like
those types of things because it's
always fluctuating and there's always
more you can do but stay tuned for the
July x99 build as well as that $2,000
build maybe I should go back to this
stay tuned for the July x99 build that
I'm gonna be doing soon also stay tuned
for the this $2,000
that I showed you today because I will
be building that very soon as well other
than that you can visit my store if you
are interested in shirts mugs or glasses
that stored up Paul's hardware net you
can buy some of those things to help me
out in my channel of course you can like
the video subscribe to my channel for
all that stuff I've already talked about
and as always thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
