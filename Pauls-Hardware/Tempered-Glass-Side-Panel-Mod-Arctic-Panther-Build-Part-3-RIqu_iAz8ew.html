tempered glass side panel mod video and
I'm gonna start right off with a spoiler
alert it was a success that's right
with the invaluable support of a couple
of my friends from the PC modding scene
specifically Lea Harrington from PC
junkie mods comm and bill Owen from MN
PC tech comm I have taken this custom
cut piece of tempered glass and
integrated it into the side panel of my
fractal design define our five case
allowing a direct view into the Arctic
Panthers glorious lead sexified interior
components and water cooling loop but
all was not sunshine and daisies with
this little project Oh No and if you
watched last week's vlog video you know
that my first shot at this mod didn't
quite turn out as I would have liked but
enough exposition let's head back in
time a couple weeks so we can watch the
younger more naive policy struggles to
accomplish this task unaware of the
looming failure that awaits but anyway
back to the stuff I gotta aside from the
Permatex adhesive sealants define our
five side panel of course I've got my
heat gun out because I am going to need
to get rid of all of that thermal
padding and the other side of this
before I can cut it for my cutter tool I
have what is effectively a dremel here
although it is not a dremel so sorry to
any of you dremel lovers out there this
is a black &amp;amp; decker
r/t x3 speed rotary tool it is a pretty
powerful one not terribly expensive and
it's plug in which is important for this
type of work because you need something
as powerful Chris I got lots of the
cutting disks because I'm probably going
to be going through those protective eye
gear please wear a protective eye gear
we're going to be doing this sort of
thing it's kind of necessary and there's
going to be sparks flying and all that
good stuff I'll come back to the side
panel but I do have a set of files here
because that's important and I got these
on Amazon again I'll put the link to
these in the description not terribly
expensive these are actually made for
wood but I was reading comments and
people were like they actually work fine
for metal too you know I don't need
anything I'm not opening a mod shop or
anything so I didn't need anything too
crazy
the whites coolant from primo chill is
there that's just for dressing it's
purely to make things look interesting
around here I've got my t-square because
I'm going to need to be measuring some
pretty specific lines on here
and lastly of course is the tempered
glass I guess kind of the main event
itself for this particular day or mod or
whatever this is from dulles glass and
mirror and they sent a nice little
certificate along with it having never
really bought tempered glass before I
found all this glass a mirror and they
have a website and they let you like set
everything up online as far as the size
you want and all that good stuff so this
is a gray glass piece of tempered glass
cut specifically to a size which I
forget it's like 15 inches by 16 inches
or something like that pretty basic
otherwise like they can do they can do
special edges on it and that sort of
thing and they can even drill holes in
that and and that kind of thing
I didn't contact them directly I only
use their website to get the glass but
it came very well packed and it's a very
nice piece the great glass is not
terribly expensive although this was a
little over $80 for this piece for a
couple bucks less you can get the
standard clear glass but that can have a
kind of green tint if you want the like
super clear glass is actually more than
that so I think super clear for this
piece would have been like 110 120 bucks
but I actually really like the gray
glass as far as the level of opacity
that it has because I think it's gonna
be a little bit tinted but still give a
good look inside buts alright enough of
my blabbing on and on the stuff let's
get on with the show
so about here is where I learned an
important case modding lesson that is
that you'll probably never managed to do
what you want to do on your first
attempt and that you'll most likely
discover that you're missing some key
tool or piece of hardware and have to
put things off for another day or
another week a lot like setting up a
custom water cooling loop actually so
that's what I did
but before we move on to the next day of
hard labor
lynda.com that's right Linda comm is my
new sponsor but more importantly they're
also an online learning platform with
over 3,000 on-demand video courses to
help you strengthen your business
technology and creative skills if
learning new and useful things appeals
to you then you can get a 10 day free
trial by visiting lynda.com/tekzilla I
started with video editing and as a
mostly self-taught editor I've already
learned useful tricks that I would not
have figured out on my own like how to
set default transition links for example
or how to better it take advantage of
workspace layouts in Adobe Premiere as
always though if you would like to try
any of these courses or if you just like
to say thank you to Linda comm for
supporting Paul's Hardware you can click

description or you can visit linda.com
slash paul back to the side panel mod
though after wallowing in self-pity for
a while and drinking myself into a
stupor which was actually more the
result of a lengthy GTA 5 session Kyle
and regrets about the failed case mod
but I reached out to bill Owen of MN PC
tech comm I recommended Bill's YouTube
channel for modders before and I have
learned quite a few tips from his videos
that I've used for this project
thankfully bill was extremely supportive
and he even sent me over a kit of stuff
to aid in my continued work on the side
panel this made up my mind about what to
do next
rather than looking into getting another
side panel from fractal or finding
someone with a CNC machine and big
thanks to all of you guys who offered by
the way I had quite a few on Twitter as
well as on the YouTube comments
I decided to have another go at the
work-in-progress despite these scuffs
and uneven lines to see what I could
salvage step one was to remeasure those
lines widening the window to account for
the spots where my jigsaw went off-track
I
use the 233 plus green tape that bill
sent over to mark it off and started
with the aluminum oxide reinforced 1.5
inch cutting wheels the larger wheels
allow for straighter cuts and these
lasts way longer than the standard
cutting discs that come with the rotary
tool I also noted that none of them
broke apart or flew across the room
while I was trying to cut with them a
big plus I also decided to wear my face
mask this time around which kept me from
inhaling too much of that result into
metal dust a good idea for anyone who's
about to do this sort of thing after a
long time cutting with the rotary tool I
started to switch off to filing
particularly for the rounded corners the
rounded file does a great job but
there's really no way to sugarcoat the
fact that this was just a lot of violate
ultimately though I got all four
straight lines straightened out and all
four rounded corners rounded more or
less next I needed to deal with these
scuffs in the paint and for that I
ordered this black self etching primer
based on Bill's recommendation now this
is serious stuff it's used for
automotive bodywork so I moved outside
for adequate ventilation and I'm of
course using a filtered face mask that's
meant for paint fumes
they just straight up says may cause
cancer on here this is this is serious
stuff suspected of damaging fertility or
the unborn child I got a little bit on
my finger but that doesn't mean that my
finger has cancer now okay so I did
forget to wear the gloves on the first
try and the breeze was kind of messing
with me but I fixed this for the second
and third coats and the self etching
primer actually does a really good job
of getting into those scuffs and
covering up my blemishes it even matches
the black paint on the rest of the case
a very important thing so I gave it a
couple hours to dry and then I moved on
to lining the cutouts edge with the
rubber you channel which gives it a much
more professional finish and also covers
up those jagged edges with that done I
started lining up the tempered glass
panel again it was actually just about
perfect I used some scissors to cut the
tape of the gods-- strip in half giving
me just enough surface area outside the
U channel to go up to the edge of the
tempered glass this stuff adheres
quickly but I gave it a lot of firm
pressure around the edges to make sure
it made good contact and just like that
it was all finished
so what do you guys think I am very
happy that I was able to rehabilitate
the side panel after the first attempt
and overall I really really like the
look of the gray glass the side of the
window the view from the interior
granted there's no LEDs in there right
now I will address fractals newest case
here though which is the define s it has
a big old side panel window and it looks
just like the define r5 on the outside
and it was really made for water-cooled
builds like this quite a few people
suggested that I just switch everything
over to that I think it's a great case
but I was just too far along with this
build to consider swapping I really
wanted tempered glass for the side panel
and I also actually like the drive cage
in here because I have a good amount of
storage to wedge in and I kind of want
to be able to show it All Things
Considered I am pretty happy with the
define r5 so is this the last video on
arctic panther build well no as I'm sure
many people who didn't watch the whole
video will point out in the comments the
cables on the PSU looked terrible still
so I still have a sleeping project to do
very soon that's thanks to the support
of mainframe customs comm also do a
final video with some finishing touches
and I really haven't ruled out updating
some of the runs in this loop too when
it comes to the PD TG hardline tubing
it's an ongoing project is what I'm
trying to say but I am really happy to
have the side panel mod finished so I
can move on to the rest that's all for
