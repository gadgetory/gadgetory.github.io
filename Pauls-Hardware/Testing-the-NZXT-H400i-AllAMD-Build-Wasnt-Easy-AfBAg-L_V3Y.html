modders all over the world who have
built some amazing systems like this
Darkseid themed case by George
priscilla's showcasing the spacious
internals in the define s or metallic
acid a mini ITX system by Justin Olson
featuring a white black and red color
scheme and a super clean layout in they
define Nano s there are a ton more
awesome builds like these on fractal
designs modding series page so check it
out via the sponsor link in this video's
description and get inspired for your
next project how's it going guys and
welcome back to Pauls hardware today's
video is going to be my follow-up for my
november monthly build which was an all
AMD system built in the new NZXT th400
eyes so as i do every month i parted out
the system earlier in the months built
it and now i'm gonna be testing it will
do some acoustic tests some thermal
tests as well as some gaming tests since
this is definitely a gaming system but
first I wanted to address some of the
feedback that I've gotten over the past
say week or two after I posted this
original video and I want to start by
talking about where these sort of
concepts and that where the builds begin
and the build began with the H 400 I the
case itself which NZXT had talked to me
about doing a video on because the H 700
I had launched which they sent me as
well and they were like hey you're
probably one of the only people who's
going to get a video up on this right as
it's becoming available do you want to
do a video on this first so I said yeah
and then beyond that I was like right
what am I going to put in the system and
I decided I wanted to do an all AMD
build for one I feel like AMD platform
right now at least when it comes to
Rison threaded / - but for the purposes
of this system Rison is kind of the most
viable bang for the buck as far as what
you get when it comes to the cpu and the
motherboard options and then the second
thought was looking at the prices of the
AMD radeon RX Vega graphics card the
vega 56 and vega 64 a couple weeks ago
they had actually come down in price to
where you could get the vega 56 for
around four hundred to four hundred
twenty dollars of course week-and-a-half
goes by and i build the system and the
prices have gone back up to closer to
five hundred dollars for a vega 56 so
that is one of the reasons why this
actual system
is not necessarily a good value for the
money there are definitely different
ways you could spend the 1700 H dollars
that was would be spent on buying and
putting the system together as is that
you could reinvest in other areas that
we get you more performance out of your
system versus making something that is
well so pretty and color-coordinated and
of course very intentionally all AMD a
couple of the things that affected the
cost leanest of the system was the
memory itself because it's corsair
dominator platinum memory and the
Dominator Platinum's can come in at
almost double the price of comparable
ddr4 memory kits and that's only with me
and the perks list using the 16 gig kit
of this memory whereas what I actually
have installed is the 32 gig kit also we
have an NZXT krey-kin X 62 liquid CPU
cooler which costs you 150 ish dollar
range kind of weird to have a CPU cooler
that costs more than several other key
components of the build like the
motherboard which only costs $75 for
example and definitely a very valid
complaint in that using the CPU cooler
with this CPU and this motherboard maybe
it's a little bit out of balance because
chances are if you were gonna strop 150
bucks on your 6 on your CPU liquid
cooler you're probably gonna spend
roughly the same amount on your
motherboard to make sure that you have
good overclocking options whether it
comes to the UEFI options or the power
delivery options now when it comes to
micro ATX and for motherboards there's
actually a fairly limited set of options
that are there and the reason I went
with this asrock motherboard was
partially due to the m2 configuration
ahead partially due to the fact that
just there aren't that many micro ATX
motherboards that are available there
are some out there asus has a tough
series motherboard for example that i
was heavily considering but in the end i
went with the aesthetic consideration
with this board and aesthetics are often
not that important unless you want
everything to look pretty and this was a
build where I wanted everything to look
pretty also in line with that is the
fact that we've included NZXT air RGB
fans three of those that are a decent
amount to the cost of the build the NZXT
hue Plus that I'm using to help control
these and then of course the NZXT Creek
and X 62 also has RGB control and as
already mentioned that was a fairly
expense
of peace as well so all this is to say
I'm not necessarily telling you guys at
home or on a budget and looking to build
a high-powered system hey guys this is
exactly what you should do this was more
of a use case scenario to show what the
age 400 eye can look like when it's all
kitted out what you can do with some of
the aesthetic options such as adding air
RGB fans if you are so inclined and of
course to put together a viable working
system in there at the same time so any
of you guys who wants to take for
instance the core components here Vega
56 and an AMD r7 1708 core CPU combine
them up with a more viable set of actual
say case power supply and whatever else
you want going in there post that in the
comments section and let me know what
you can get with roughly the same level
of performance but a lot less money if
you're not as worried about it looking
pretty anyway that's enough of an
introduction and addressing as some of
the feedback I got on this build let's
now move on to some testing so the first
thing I did with this build of course
was get windows installed and went and
updated the UEFI 2 version I believe
around 3.1 now the latest version for
this motherboard part of the thing I was
trying to figure out there with the
initial build in the first video was
just getting the NZXT fans to light up I
should bear in mind that you may need to
install windows up the Windows operating
system and load up the canvas software
in order for those to light up but once
I did all that stuff everything was
working just fine so that's cool
second step of course was to install the
cam software and then beyond that get
windows loaded and updated and all of
that good stuff but with the cam
software it's it's had its its share of
quirks with us so far for instance when
I first loaded it the and I and I loaded
up my profile it actually had the window
off screen I thought it was on a second
monitor and I had some difficulty just
getting that to come back over because
it's not a resizable piece of software
here whatever but I ended up solving
that by plugging in a second monitor and
I was able to access it and grab it and
pull it back over I think that has
something to do with my personal profile
and whatever system I used this on
before it had more than one
monitor connected to it but cam can do
quite a few different things it's got
some basic monitoring here so you can
see the CPU temperature and load and
clock speed fan speed same thing for the
GPU as far as temps fan speeds clock
speeds memory usage is also there as
well as the storage that you have
connected up here then you can see some
basic info about your computer on this
screen here we can also verify that the
RAM speed is set at its proper speed
29:33 is a divider and I was able to do
that just by going in and plugging in
the XMP setting from this memory it's
running at casa latency I was listening
to caste legacy 15 but here it's listed
at 16
anyway that's close enough beyond that
there's a gaming overlay you can able
there's some over overclocking you can
access and then of course there's fan
speed control which is very nice when
you have device is connected to the fan
the fans for the crack in X 62 actually
I plugged directly into the motherboard
CPU fan header so I went into the
motherboard fan configuration and I set
that to silent mode and then I've done
the same thing with the fan
configuration here for the three air
fans that are connected up to the NZXT
smart device that's part of the H 400 I
for this one I just made a custom
profile so they're only running at about
30% fan speed when they're in low mode
and that is working just fine for us
here we can also see the fan speed of
the Krakken X 62 as well for lighting
this is your interface right here we're
going to come back to that in just a
second beyond that there's a couple more
tabs this is for the smart device
calibration which I don't believe we'll
be touching on today gamers Nexus did a
little test on that and found it to be
still needs a little bit of work and
then on this last tab you have some
driver information so we can see we have
drivers properly installed for our grid
+ u + and the crack in X 62 the great
plus is what it will recognize that
smart device as you plus you saw me
install at the bottom and a crack in
this is just the ACE tech USB driver and
that will let you do stuff such as
monitoring the liquid temperature so for
your notifications over here I've
disabled them for the time being but for
instance CPU notification you can tell
to notify you when it reaches a certain
CPU temperature GPU temperature or down
here at the bottom the actual
temperature of the liquid in the crack
and X 62 notifying you when it goes
above sixty is a good idea because you
don't
run a iOS with really warm fluid so if
you have a heavy overclock going
something you definitely want to keep an
eye on moving back to the lighting
though there's actually individually you
can see listed the Krakken the smart
device which has a couple channel so you
can actually do looks like up to four
channels connected there and that is the
LED that's going right across the top
here in front of the fans and then of
course you have the hue plus and that
will tell you what fans you have
connected up there and it's two channels
you can do up to four smart LEDs and the
connected directly at the same time and
daisy chained together or up to five of
the fans that's because the fans have
eight LEDs on them whereas the strip's
have ten LEDs so eight times five is
forty or four times eight is less than
that no ten ten times four is also 40
yes math now there's a sync mode here
and which I was attempting to use
briefly you can turn it on and it's
supposed to sync all of them up together
so you can see now when I turn that on
all the lights on the air fans the LED
strip going across the top and the
Krakken X 62 all turn to be the same
color and if you click on the actual
color you're supposed to be able to
adjust it right now it has covering
marquee however here was I had an issue
like it it doesn't it doesn't work there
appears to be some issues with this
specific preset although I was able to
do that so some of the custom profiles
that I saved it does appear like I am
able to load up and get functional but
if I want to go if I want to actually
just go in here and like change this
color or whatever like if I just wanted
it to be blue alright nevermind it's
working
this was acting a little bit more funky
for me when I first attempted it the
other day but it does seem to be
functional again this is what the sync
all of them at the same time function so
let's see if we can just do red green
and blue there we go for getting a nice
fade between red green and blue when
it's doing it on all of those that makes
it that's kind of Christmasy it's a
little Christmasy
tip the blue so here's here's where I
think this might just be a UI issue so
for example right now if I want to
adjust this actual profile I can't I
can't delete that and it was also giving
me trouble selecting the various colors
here so anyway let's go back and turn
off the sync all and we can individually
address these guys so all channels since
there's two channels on the Krakken you
can individually adjust the logo led by
itself or you can individually adjust
the ring LED going around the outside
that's so we can do something like a
spectrum wave and here now you should be
able to see since I'm doing these
individually I have changed the NZXT
crack and X 62 LEDs to change but
everything else is still going with my
candy cane theme that I initially set up
do you like that when you do when you
choose a color it gives you the color
code I believe that's a hex code down
there at the bottom so you can easily
grab that if you want to jump over to
something else and do the same color so
let's switch to our smart device Channel
here I'll do this also fixed green and
now we're moving a little bit more
towards a Christmas theme I have the
green in red and I've also we've still
got the red and white from the candy
canes this is this is just so seasonal
and appropriate I don't know what to do
now with the Marquis and the individual
control over the lights you also have
the ability to set up profiles here so
you can make a profile there and change
between its and you can also do some
settings such as the interval of the
LEDs if it's going around the loops a
little bit too fast there you can change
it to the slow mode there you can also
change forward to backwards so if the
LEDs are progressing in one direction
you're like no want to go the other way
you can switch it back the other way
now what it's doing right now it's just
a basic marquee and it's in white so
it's not leaving the LEDs lit up on the
air fans it's just doing that white
going around each one and since I
reversed it it's going from the three
two one now instead of one two three and
now we have the covering marquee which I
have also set up in red and green and
yeah this system very ideally suited if
you want a Christmas theme or if you
want red and white of course beyond that
it's a red and black build so
you're probably going to want to choose
colors for the RGB lighting inside this
is somewhat complementary to red and
black so you're you're blocked out of
some but there's a lot of cool options
and hopefully as you've seen right now
especially if it's Christmastime
get yourself set up with some candy
canes or some red and green mistletoe
and holly super exciting anyway let's
move on to some more actual testing
so as I was getting prepped to do the
sound test sounded temperature testing
on the system I realized it was emitting
a persistent little rattling noise at
first I thought it was maybe the pump
and maybe it was just working through
getting some air bubbles out of there
but actually it ended up being this top
front 140 millimeter fan rattling not at
all speeds but definitely it's enough
speed said it was definitely a defective
fan so fortunately NZXT was able to
replace that so that's good and I
actually this is the fan the offending
fan itself I have pulled it out and
unfortunately pulling out a fan like
that with its three different
connections and wiring in the back and
pulling all that out not the simplest
task but I got it out of there and got
the new one end and thankfully it's now
nice and quiet which you can probably
mainly hear hero snoring right now but
we're gonna do our noise test in just a
second so yeah thankfully that has
solved the problem of the Bradley fan
problem number two has arisen though as
you might be able to tell our lighting
isn't exactly all on right now we do
have a look high high reflection we do
have the green but the fans aren't going
to the correct colors right now the fans
are what's connected up to the hue Plus
which is down there in the bottom a
quick aside to a larger problem like a
really big problem
my main capture system the godly PC with
my hubris is being punished because it
is on the fritz right now I hey ketta
gets working on that but as a result
I've got no means of doing actual screen
capture right now so let me show you
guys this though this is the cam
software again and this is where we go
to control lighting you might see the
Kraken right up at the top being told to
be all green okay and to the smart
device the extra device part of the H
400 I they're also being told to be
green but where'd my hue plus go was
there before funny thing is we can go
over here to see the driver devices and
it's their hue plus the driver is
installed so don't know what the deal is
here
but I can no longer control the lighting
on the U+ and EXT did send me some
troubleshooting tips here you can get
other control panels and remove it as a
USB device so I'll try that in a second
if not I gotta like swap the cable and
see if the cables an issue also possibly
to try a different USB port but I
already know that that can't be done
there's no more available on the
motherboard or connecting up to a
different PC but since as mentioned eff
and I've already got the problem of like
my main capture system back there not
working I really need to move on to that
so I'm gonna leave this as mystery
unsolved for now just a bug apparently
will hopefully get worked out fixed with
NZXT and let's move on to the San test
so guys that just about wraps it up for
this video of my testing of this little
computer and the H 400 I again as
mentioned in the beginning of the video
I think you guys will find that this
build is a little bit more geared
towards aesthetics and there was more
money spent on that so completely agree
with any of you guys who are down there
in the comments saying I could build a
way faster system for the amount of
money that went into this but all things
considered for those of you who do want
a system that is presentation worthy
that you can have set up in your gaming
room or out in your living room or in
HTTP or something where people walk in
and be like wow that looks really cool I
think it's really nice what NZXT has
done both with the design of the H 400 I
and the considerations that they've made
to help you light it all up in the
blingy flash in with the addressable
LEDs and the control via the NZXT hue
plus as well as the smart device they
included on the case as well as the NZXT
creakin X 62 hey guys if you enjoyed
this video then definitely hit the
thumbs up button on your way out thank
you so much for watching I'll be back
with more tech videos very soon it is
holiday season right now so I know
there's lots of people who are
interested and getting those holiday
deals out so if you guys wanna help me
this holiday season definitely click on
my links to the products that I've used
in this build that are all down in the
video's description and thank you so
much for watching again we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
