to Falls Hardware this is my monthly
builds video for December 2018 every
month at the beginning of the month I do
a couple PC parts lists for those of you
who might want to build a computer but
don't necessarily know which parts to
choose to put in there especially if
you're looking for good deals or just
perks that can fit well together now I
have actually already built the PC of
the month for this month it's right here
so you'll be seeing this build video
very soon probably the next day or two
but just in case you're really antsy and
you want to check out more builds check
out my builds playlist if you want to
see me building many other computers in
the past this video is also based on
your feedback so last month I asked what
PC builds or what type of PC build you
guys want to see this month we have a
$1000 PC so we can remember 2018 pricing
and compared to 2019 we'll have to of
course wait a few months probably to do
that but I actually don't have a
strawpoll for next month for January
just because it's the beginning of a new
year we're starting fresh there's some
new launches coming I'm also gonna be
gone to Computex at the beginning of the
month so don't worry though I still will
do the builds video next month so don't
forget to subscribe if you're not
already that said let us dive in and
start off with the first build for this
month this is the $1,000 gaming PC as
requested and I want to point out
there's a bit of a theme for these two
builds for this month and that is
giveaway yes that's right I'm going to
be giving away this system right here
we're gonna be doing that during a
charity livestream that's happening on
Saturday in just a couple days so on
December 8th Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10
p.m. Pacific time here in California
we're gonna be live-streaming from right
here me and Kyle it should be lots of
fun and we're gonna raise some money for
some children's charities as well so
stay tuned for that and again you can
enter to win you don't need to donate to
the charity to enter the giveaway but
you know it's always nice if you do that
- point being though here's a $1000 PC
build which is loosely based on this
system I put together here that meaning
the system I put together here was
largely based around parts that I had on
hand so I could put the system together
here we have a very comparable system
I've swapped a few parts out here and
there to make things a little bit more
sensible where necessary but it's a
risin 5 2600 based system it's still a
very solid 6 core processor 170 dollars
now you were able to get this for 10
bucks less than that a week or two ago
on Black Friday but that's ok still $478
great deal and it comes with a CPU
cooler as well we got an Asus RG Strix
motherboard we have 16 gigs of memory we
have a 512 gig nvme SSD a 1070 TI as
well as a defined an OS and a 550 watt
80 plus bronze rated power supply all
coming in for about nine hundred and
ninety four dollars so here is the
processor not a whole lot to be said
here it's it's a solid processor it's
$170 so let's move on here is the
motherboard this motherboard I
specifically chose again because I have
it here so I can build the system and do
the giveaway you can definitely get away
with a motherboard that's maybe 10 20 30
bucks cheaper than this that'd still be
450 and Mini ITX and will fit in here so
feel free to peruse some of the other
ones that are out there you can't get 10
bucks off this motherboard though right
now with this promo code and it is a
very solid motherboard overall it's got
some nice features like dual RGB headers
at the top both addressable and non
addressable and it's also got a couple
MDOT two slots one on the front here
that has a heatsink over it and then
there is another MDOT two on the back of
the motherboard not that new a bother to
take a picture of the back that trust me
it's there I just built with it oh also
one last thing is the audio jacks light
up which is one of those kind of nice
higher-end asus rog features but it's
actually pretty convenient if you're
trying to fumble around for plugging in
mic and headphone jacks and it's dark
you see the lights back there and it's a
red a green and a we're adding a green
light for the mic and headphone at least
I forgot to tell you someone's blue
anyway rememory I have of course their
vengeance lpx kit because it's a
long-standing kit that's always been
compatible with Rison it's only hundred
and thirty dollars you could get a
cheaper kit than this I was finding 16
gig kits for as low as 110 or so but
this is a very widely compatible kit and
it's the one I used so feel free to shop
around if you wanna save a little bit of
money there but I can tell you with
confidence that kit will work with Rison
here is the SSD and this is the Intel
660 P series which is $90 for a 512 GB
SSD which doesn't seem like that great
of a deal if you're comparing it to the
Black Friday deals that we're going on
like a week or two ago it's still not
bad I will say if you're looking for a
500 gig Class SSD you can get a 2.5 inch
one for about 55 to 65 dollars so you
could save 20 or 30 bucks here the SSD
actually used in this build is the
Toshiba RC 100 which is a very tiny
22:42 only 42 millimeter long SSD it's
480 gig and
is nvme it's got about 16 hundred
megabytes per second reads and about
1100 megabytes per second writes on this
model unfortunately it's not really
widely available right now from what I
found so that is why I've swapped in
this until SSD 660 P series SSD instead
which is comparable in terms of
performance and it's still not crazy
expensive so that's what I did there
we have it 1070 TI for the graphics card
in here and I've chosen the cheapest one
currently available for this builds list
which is available on B and H for only
three hundred and sixty dollars so
that's a great deal right there that
does backorder but it's affected to be
available soon and I want to point out
sort of a weird thing going on right now
with the GTX pricing in the mid-range
410 70s 1070 T is and 10 80s there's
there's just a big jump for the 1080 for
some reason for the 1070 s you can get
as cheap as 330 $340 1070 T is starting
as low as 360 bucks maybe 380 if you
want a 1080 though you really have to
climb your way up this chart in fact the
easiest way is just to not look at 10 70
years of 1072 eyes we can see the
cheapest 1080 is 400 I'm sorry $500
which is significantly more than a 1070
TI especially given how close in
performance the two are together and I
think part of the reason for this is
that the 2070 is taking the place of the
GTX 1080 so if you're comparing the two
then I would say get a 2070 over the
2080 if you're gonna be paying $500 but
also that said there's like a hundred
and twenty hundred and thirty dollar
price drop off if you're willing to go
with a 1070 TI rather than the 1080 so I
think the 1070 FEI is kind of in a nice
sweet spot right now when it comes to
bang for the buck in the 300 to 400
dollar price range and that's why I
chose that rounding things out for this
build though I have an inexpensive case
a fractal design to find an OS and this
is a very good case my wife's current
build is in this case and it's only $55
again I built the actual system in this
real ot√°rio case which is a CR 280 you
can get this case for seven year 80
bucks and it's a good case comparing
that between the two I probably go with
the defined nan OS for $55 instead it is
slightly larger than this case actually
but does a little bit more support in
there for water cooling and it's a
little bit better built in my opinion as
well
and lastly here's a corsair cx-5
pity watt power supply 50 bucks 550
watts 80 plus bronze rated again during
Black Friday time we were finding 50 to
$60 80 plus gold rated power supplies
for about the same wattage so definitely
still shop around and see if that's
available but this is sort of a good
all-around choice for a power supply and
I'm pretty confident that that will
remain in stock at this price so that is
this build roughly a 1,000 dollar gaming
PC in a little mini ITX case and again
this system will be given away very soon
so stay tuned to my channel for that
my second build for December is
significantly more expensive actually
about 4,500 dollars total and it's
mostly Asus products and you might look
at me and say Paul what are you doing
just chilling out for asus by doing an
all Asus build and I will say I don't
usually go this route when it comes to
builds and say hey get all Asus products
and put them all in there this system is
also probably going to be given away
this is a giveaway I've been working on
with Asus for a little while now it's
been delayed slightly but I will say
that I had this processor arrive in the
mail so I'm fairly confident this is
still going forward I'm not sure if it's
still gonna go through this month in
December or might be pushed to January
but it is a call of duty black ops 4
build with a ton of Asus hardware and
it's an absolutely insane overall system
again was the total retail price of
about 4500 dollars and and again gonna
give all of this stuff away once I build
the system so highlights are the i7 9700
k-8 core processor at the heart of it
and then we also have a geforce r-tx 20
80 TI the 11 gig ROG Strix Edition which
currently retails if you can find it in
stock for about $1400 as well as a ton
of other hardware Asus peripherals and
and all that good stuff so let's run
down kind of the highlights here AC SRT
Maximus 9 hero motherboard they have a
call of duty black ops 4 edition of this
and I believe actually they have call of
duty black ops 4 special editions of
some of this other Hardware too I wasn't
able to find that all listed but you'll
probably be seeing a little bit more
like this so it's got some black ops 4
logo designs on the heatsinks as well as
the lighting and other than that it's a
Maximus 9 here which is also a solid
motherboard for memory we still have
decided on that so I'm assuming it's
gonna be something along these lines
though a 32 gig kit this is a Corsair
Vengeance
200 speak it a little on the more
expensive side again but what do you
guys carry if it's a giveaway system
there is cheaper memory than that of
course but I'm getting distracted here
is the graphics card which you can auto
notify for $1400 at Newegg right now but
this is the ROG Strix edition of the
r-tx 2080 TI i actually have a couple of
these they're beastly cards i really
like some of the updates they've done to
the design it is a phat card it's about
2.7 slots as far as the space it takes
up but I really like this brace they've
put along the whole thing it really
makes a lot sturdier and helps combat
GPU sag with that it's also got some
nice lighting on there too so very
similar to their previous generation but
it's a good design beyond that we have a
LAN Lee PCO 11 err case the Black
Edition this is the airflow version with
it which I think will be more
appropriate for this build since there's
lots of hardware going on inside a solid
case so only about $110 at doing Asus is
throwing in the ROG Thor 1200 watt power
supply which is an insane massive power
supply with RGB lights on the side and
there's other features included here
it's just it's basically Asus throwing
the kitchen sink at a power supply and
trying to over design it as much as they
can so very expensive power supply but
again if you win it for free what do you
care
here is the monitor we're going with
which is the rog swift PG 2 v 8q24 point
five inch so not the hugest and it is
1080 but 240 Hertz refresh yes indeed
this is a high refresh rate monitor so
for serious gamers who wants maximum
frames for competitive gameplay or just
maximum smoothness combine that with
g-sync
and you have a very solid gaming monitor
oh and it's still got that Asus logo
that shoots down onto the ground
underneath the monitor as well as I
guess I guess a fancy ventilation system
I wasn't aware of that but there you go
Mouse we got the ROG Gladius 2 or a sync
currently sells for 82 bucks
I've only dabbled this with with this
mouse briefly but it has a pretty good
feel to it then we also have the
keyboard actually the keyboard I'm using
right now which is the ROG Strix flair
which I've actually kind of liked so far
originally I thought that it didn't have
the sturdiest feel to it but the more I
use it actually the more I've been
liking it it does have a bit of sort of
a brush metal edge
corner here and then it's got this kind
of edge lighting here along the sides -
one thing I haven't done is get the
software installed so I can do some more
fancy lighting right now I'm using one
of the defaults that it ships with they
are throwing in a headset - in the ROG
Strix fusion 700 gaming headsets this I
have the box for but I haven't taken it
out and mess around with it too much but
again looks looks pretty fancy I'm not
gonna speak on this too much until I've
tried it out of it myself but Asus
generally does a pretty good job with
their peripherals that I've seen so
there is that finally you may have
noticed that there's no liquid cooler
right up here and that's because I added
it it's actually down here because it's
not currently registering on PC part
picker is a liquid cooler anyway the
ryujin asus rog all-in-one liquid cooler
there have been a few videos that have
gone up on this just recently it's
pretty insane it's two hundred and
eighty dollars so it's expensive for a
liquid cooler but they've gone all out
they've included knocked two of fans
that are all black they've got some nice
sleeve tubing addressable RGB LEDs as
well as a NC vm coated cover I don't
even know what that is
there's an embedded fan fan along in the
pump to help cool it off and there's a
little life - full color LED display on
there - so that's pretty insane when it
comes to the liquid cooler of course but
I really like that they paired up with
Noctua for the fans and you know it
seems like if you got the money to spend
then it's pretty beastly of course like
I've been mentioned in this whole time
this is gonna be all included in a
giveaway so maybe again you don't care
how much this stuff costs if you happen
to win it on my channel so definitely
subscribe to Paul's Hardware for this
giveaway coming in the future again
we're still getting that some of the
final parts together so I'm not a
hundred percent sure when that's going
to start but tons of giveaway is
actually coming up this weekend in just
a few days so again join us for that
live stream on December 8th from 10 a.m.
to 10 p.m. Pacific time we're going to
