hardware I am not exactly sure how to
introduce this video because on the one
hand it's a normal video it's part of my
regular monthly build series but on the
other hand it's a different video than
normal because this is actually my third
video on the January build which I don't
normally go this far but I was really
waiting until the software solution was
set up right since this is an RGB
featured build and the software is not
working in fact all of my led is not
synchronized so this video is going to
be an actual test the full-on tests of
the RGB skills of the system I'm also
going to do just a little bit of
additional benchmarking and also want
some feedback from you guys because I'm
going to be actually doing a little
comparison in this video
between my system that I built here and
Kyle system that he built which was
originally a white RGB system and then
he added the G field strategy memory to
it and he did a video a couple weeks ago
asking for feedback and everything on
different RGB lighting configuration so
I'm going to be actually using some of
his lighting configurations in my builds
here and seeing if I can recreate them
myself
I also have a couple straw polls that
are linked down in the description below
because I I asked before I did this
build what color system I should build
in and you guys answered black and
that's why it's a primarily black build
with RGB lights but I want to ask that
one more time does do you think a white
build would look better now that you can
also cross compare this to Kyle's build
so answer answer in that straw poll if
you want to and then I also have a
question about the RGB LED cake bands
because I think that's another one of
the big differences is Kyle had the NZXT
air case fans that are RGB as well in
his whereas I don't have those and that
wasn't necessarily conscious choice of
my parts actually the empty air fans
were around at the time when I was
originally partying out the system but
let me know via responses to those
questions and hopefully hopefully we
will find an answer a final answer that
lasts until the end of time all right
one other quick thing I want to mention
in some of the benchmarks because I
usually do benchmarks and my monthly
builds and show you guys some
comparisons I did a lot of that and the
part two video for this
feel free to check out that also this
video is kind of rush because I'm
actually like back here behind me I'm
benchmarking Rison right you can't see
it there my rise and sets bed is back
there and I'm trying to get this video
out before that one goes out too so
that's why I'm a little bit rushed
but all that being said there are going
to be additional benchmarks of this
system in my rising comparison video
which should be up very soon so check
that out if you want to see some
additional stuff I did have to cut this
down a little bit to make them
comparable so I had to pull a couple the
memory sticks out and actually under
clocked the the graphics cards the GTX
980 from Asus under there so it would
line up more with that anyway more on
that in that actual video and since I
hadn't done it earlier I also wanted to
do a quick benchmark on the SSDs it's
installed here so it was a pretty
significant portion of the cost of this
system it's seven hundred bucks right
now for the Rd 400 from OC OC OC z
Toshiba but it's really fast so here's
my benchmark results for that I ran a
crisp Lotus mark and a doe just really
quick bear in mind that the system is
running off of that SSD right now
Windows is loaded on to it so this is
not how I would normally test an SSD
these are results despite it also
running the OS at the same time so 1.6
gigabytes per second reads 1.2 gigabytes
per second writes for sequential numbers
for 4k those numbers are also pretty
impressive faster 4k numbers here than
you get from a typical SATA SSD and like
looking at the right raid like you'd
have to take like 3 SATA SSDs and rate
them in raid 0 to get anything close to
this so that's pretty impressive from a
single drive I option down here we're
about 160,000 and 120,000 for reason
rice respectively also pretty impressive
and then I ran through a dough which
does a bunch of different test sizes and
what that has a larger the test size the
better the drive is going to be able to
perform but here again with writes we
got up in the 1.2 to 1.4 gigabytes per
second right and then for reads about
1.6 1.5 right in there so very
impressive still both ways now beyond
the SSD for overall performance again a
little bit more on that in my previous
video and a little bit more coming on
that in my rising comparison video but
overall really happy with the system the
CPU was a
overclocked to 4.9 gigahertz that's
pretty nice not quite five would like to
hit five but you know 4.9 can't really
complain about that at sunset 7700 K the
memory was running at 3200 I did dial it
back to about 3000 again for the risin
comparison test but then the the
graphics card when overclock was hitting
about 2050 to 2000 seventy-five
megahertz
on the GPU clock all really impressive
numbers and of course those lead to good
performance and benchmarks as well but
this video is going to be light on
benchmarks and more about the lighting
demonstration actually one other thing I
wanted to point out about this build I
am I didn't grow up or didn't get into
building pcs for aesthetics it took me a
while to come around to being like okay
maybe we can make them look pretty too
and the fact that I do videos definitely
is no small impact on that so a big part
of my goal with this I don't really feel
like I've stated this as directly as I
could have was making a build that has
our DV lighting but also has the ability
to turn it all off if you want to or has
the ability to do subtle changes to make
it so it's not necessarily like a
rainbow vomit going on all the time you
could make it a single color or that
kind of thing anyway all that being said
let's actually test out some of this
functionality that we have so we're
controlling all the lights on this build
with two pieces of software the Asus
aura software is controlling the
motherboard lights the graphics cards
lights as well as the case lights
because the case lights are all wired
into the motherboard and the case lights
of course is what I was having some
problems with in part 2 of this video
and that fortunately has been fixed man
techs actually has a pretty cool looking
little controller function board up
there on the top front of their case
that's where the power button goes and
actually that wires up to the RGB
lighting control which is also on the
front panel of the case and all you have
to do once you've wired this up properly
to the motherboard is you actually need
to hold in the button on that RGB
control panel in order to turn off that
the board little PCB up there it's
trying to control the lights as well
that's why I was getting strange
lighting configurations once you do that
everything should sync up properly as
you see right now with the Asus or a
software something you have control that
all right else have the NZXT cams
we're in that it's a hundred percent
only controlling the NZXT Creek and
crackin X 62 which is right there
there's two LED lights on that the NZXT
logo across the middle and the ring
light goes around the outside and I can
turn those both off or on so like right
now I just turn them back on and they
are working yay
and I can control those both
independently for now I'm going to turn
those off just so you guys can only look
at the aura aura stuff or a controlled
stuff and then in the software we can
see that we have the motherboard the
graphics card in the RAM and that's the
other reason why I made it part three of
this video was the RAM was not showing
up in the software at all and the memory
and that is of course the big
improvement to this software is that you
can get the memory lighting control as
well and I think that's a slightly
bigger deal because the memory it's I
don't know they I feel like do you feel
did a good job with that it stands out a
lot and it definitely adds to everything
so you can actually individually control
the individual elements here LED strips
- PCH to the back i/o the graphics cards
of memory actually can individually
control each memory stick if you want to
that's what the static or breathing
functions or you can press this button
here which well I'm sorry this one
button will do motherboard only this
button will apply it to all all devices
so you definitely want to pay attention
to that as you're going back and forth
if you're just choosing a single color
single colors are fun and it's probably
an easy way to synchronize with the NZXT
stuff on there but I don't mind I don't
mind the color cycle again no user
interaction here that will just give you
your cycling rainbow effects I don't
know why is that there's a separate
rainbow on here probably gives you a
little bit more direct control I do like
that you can sequence these individually
so you have mainboard the memory and the
VGA and you can tell it which color to
go to first or after that this actually
does a rainbow effect with all the
different devices so the devices will be
different colors at different times so
that is the difference between color
cycle and the rainbow effect you can
also reverse that or you can do a
gradient if you want to do a gradient
because that do and there we go
a gradient as opposed to what it was
before
comment is an interesting one looks at
that up and see how that goes basically
comment it's going to flash through all
of the different LEDs on the port which
is going to do the LEDs in the case and
then it'll do well all the other ones
that you connect you guys actually have
a better view of it right now
it also cycles down through all the ones
and the memory LEDs as well which looks
kind of cool and you can actually change
up the sequence again here as well to
tell which you want to flash to first if
you don't like the order that it's going
in and then you've got flash and dash
which I actually think looks a little
bit better flash in - keeps the lights
on the dims and then it will flash each
one is it cycles through flash and dash
is also apparently doing a gradient
right now which lets go back to plane
let's do that to all devices okay there
now flash and dash is doing a single
color flashing up each each individual
one and cycling surance which doesn't
look too bad
they had like an RGB lightning storm at
CES but that's not here anymore
or maybe it was just flash and - and
that's what I thought it was you can of
course do strobing which I think has
limited limited value in my personal
opinion just flashes on and on you know
can change the speed if you want to and
then of course you have some reactive
stuff so you can tell it to base it on
the Sun system temperature so if CPUs
will 40 degrees it will get green as you
see right now perhaps that one's a
little bit more functional and then
music and I'm going to come back to the
music because I think music is actually
going to be the best bet for
synchronizing this with the cam software
since you can tell them both to
synchronize music and we'll see if they
both do at the same time all that being
said let's go and attempt to recreate
some of the ones that Kyle did in his
video since I am offensively trying to
do a little comparison here the first
shot what he did was Miami so we can do
with Miami Miami and we think like maybe
turquoise and and pink I think are
probably the primary colors that you're
going to want to go with
all right there's there's my best shot
of a Miami theme what do you guys think
thank you turquoise that's Miami here is
my attempt at vomits I have gradients of
green yellow and sort of a brownish
orange going on most of the case and
then got a similar rotating sort of
disorienting vomity color gone with the
MDX tee there as well looks look lovely
here's my shot at seizure as requested
by gamers Nexus originally on Kyle's
video I've attempted to do as many
colors as possible flashing and changing
as quickly as possible the effect is
quite mesmerizing here is my attempt at
portal and add just stuck with blue and
orange for this one here I will
completely agree with you guys that some
see being able to set individual fan
LEDs to blue or orange would have been
perfect for this one but here I just
want some orange trim around the outside
blue for most of everything on the
motherboard and then of course use the
NZXT circular LED for the foreign orange
foil right down the middle and finally
here since I don't have quite the same
amount of experience Cal goes with the
illicit drug use apparently here is a
Christmas theme I just made this one up
so I skipped over the acid and the rave
and just with Christmas you know nice
and wholesome red and green looks looks
ok I don't know it's nice to have a
theme for your computer and be able to
just engage that whenever the
appropriate holiday comes around and
besides all that when was the last time
you're able to do a candy cane theme
with your memory this is the first for
me lots of firsts today actually
and there you have it guys a
demonstration of the lighting
capabilities of my classy RGB tools that
I have right here and I think it's
pretty cool actually the things I'm
missing are going to be actually a
couple of the effects that the g.skill
had in their software which again is
really similar to the Asus or a software
but the g.skill software only controls
the g.skill memory then a couple more
effects in there so of course I'm
imagining the software is going to
continue to be enhanced and developed as
time goes by and it does seem like they
have the ability to throw some
additional effects in their tube said
what I have shown off today so I think
I've done just about everything I wanted
to do except one last thing for you guys
out there who are purists and aren't
into our GB look looking off button
that's an off button there and then
these are ass buttons here and look my
class the RGB build is classy again
because there's no more RGB LEDs thanks
for watching this video guys hope you
enjoyed it it's dumb but sometimes lemon
on your way out if you did links to this
build all the parts and everything are
down in the description as well as my
previous videos we're actually put this
thing together
stay tuned for Rison videos coming out
really really soon I can't tell you
exactly when but trust me if soon you
guys will be excited and yeah thanks
again for watching we'll see you next
time
and
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
