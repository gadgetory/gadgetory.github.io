I feel like I should be more excited
about today it is Monday June 19th and
there is a new Intel high end a desktop
platform on the market today you're
going to be able to read or watch
legitimate intel core x-series CP
reviews and you can pre-order these
chips today now as well but you
shouldn't because pre-ordering things is
generally a bad idea
the actual for sale dates when these
will ship out is June 24th so why am I
not more excited about this I mean I've
used in sells high-end desktop platforms
since they kicked it off with x58 the
first platform of triple channel memory
I enthusiastically moved up to X 79 and
X 99 when they launched the high-end
Intel stuff usually gets refreshed about
every three years and today marks the
move from X 99 and the LGA 2011 - three
socket - X - 99 and the LGA 2066 socket
I think the subdued response to this
launch though is caused by three things
one is that it was definitely rushed and
there's plenty of evidence that Intel
wasn't actually planning to kick off
this platform for another two months or
so for example the 12 core and higher
CPUs that they have announced are still
just on paper and they aren't expected
to Intel August to October 2017 and many
reviewers including myself still haven't
received a CPU samples to test directly
from Intel to is that there's actually
competition from Andy on the horizon
with their recently announced thread
Ripper series which will also be a
high-end desktop solution and three the
existence of to four core CPUs at the
bottom of this CPU stack they'd only
have 16 PCIe lanes and are essentially
cable 8 CPUs the 7600 K and 7700 K
stapled on to a much larger package with
a higher TDP and no I GPU which also
means no quick sync these two CPUs are
the 70 640 X and the 77 40 X and since
gigabyte was kind enough to lend me a 77
40 X so I could get up and running with
today's video I've decided to make that
the focus of today's video
what happens when you plug in a 16 PCIe
Lane kulick X CPU into one of these
high-end motherboards that it's also
designed for skylake X CPUs that might
have 28 or 44 PCI Express lanes the
short answer is a lot of stuff doesn't
work so the example boards I have for
you today are the gigabyte or is X 299
gaming 7 the MSI X 299 gaming Pro carbon
AC and the Asus prime X 299 deluxe as of
today the msi board will cost you about
360 dollars the asus is 490 and the
gigabyte Oris is about 400 the cheapest
x 299 board I could find on Newegg was
230 bucks and that's an as rock board
that doesn't even launch until July 15
keep that price in mind as these are
high-end desktop boards usually a
full-featured mainstream Intel Z 270 or
AMD X 370 motherboard can be found for
150 to 200 dollars now motherboard
connects your processor to everything
else in your system and today I'll be
focusing on how it does that
specifically the connection between the
processor and your memory and the
processor and PCI Express Lanes system
memory is simpler so let's start there
KB Lake X CPUs have a dual channel
memory controller and skylake X CPUs
have a quad channel memory controller
basically this means that on every X 299
motherboard you can only use half of the
memory slots if you pair it with a 77 40
X or 7640 x-48 dim boards like the ones
that I have today that means the entire
left bank of slots goes unused and for
some X 2 99 boards that only have four
dimm slots I mean you can only use two
of them which is like having an ITX
board all three of these boards list
that limitation very specifically in the
manual so you know which slots to
populate based on your hardware and your
memory kit so that's good CCI Express is
next and that's where it gets a little
bit more confusing remember that the pci
express lane breakdown of 16 4 kb lake x
+ 28 or 44 for skylake X refers to PCI
Express directly connected to the CPU
these are usually routed to PCI Express
expansion slots but those can also be
connected up to em to friend nvme SSDs
for example there's also 22 24 pcie 3.0
lanes that are available through the
x2 99 chipset but the chipset is
actually kind of acting like a big PCIe
switch in this case there's actually
four PCIe lanes available to the chipset
which are multiplied via the switch to
connect multiple devices like SATA
drives USB ports network adapters and m
dot 2 or u dot suits plots for SSDs the
fact that these are a switch is usually
not a big deal because the chipsets
bandwidth rarely gets fully saturated
but if you're accessing multiple
high-speed storage devices like nvme
SSDs it can create a bottleneck the
upside to nvme SSDs connected through
the chipset is that you can raid up to
three of them together with Intel Rapid
Storage Technology and yes that can be
rated in a bootable array so with all
this in mind let's see how these three
boards implements the connectivity
options that are provided by insel I'm
going to start with this MSI board since
they provided a block diagram in their
manual as you can see it's clearly laid
out that the CPU PCIe lanes are all
routed to the full sized PCI Express
expansion slots and everything else is
connected through the chipset that
includes a couple of these short little
PCIe by one slots they also added a page
or two of extra explanation for KB Lake
X setups in the manual and here we can
see that with a 44 Lane CPU we have by
16 by 4 by 16 and by 8 on all of these
full-size slots but with a 16 Lane CPU
it's cut down 2 by 8 and by 8 for
two-way support or by 8 by 4 by 4 and in
all cases with the 16 million CPU this
bottom slot becomes useless
moving over to storage since everything
else goes through the chipset MSI used a
switch to connect up the two m2s
the u2 and the SATA ports fortunately
again they use an extra page in the
manual to explain how this all breaks
down where you can see that the more
MDOT you are you got to connect to
devices that you have two fewer Sater
reports remain active since they share
bandwidth next let's look at the asus
prime x 299 deluxe no block diagram here
unfortunately but based on the PCIe
breakdown in the manual we can see the
Asus like MSI decided that with K be
like X CPUs all lanes should be
dedicated to PCIe expansion slots most
likely for GPUs with a single by 16 at
the top or by 8 and by 8 in the two
primary slots being the two options this
again means that the chipset lane
handle everything else so your options
become choose between your 8o 2.11 ad
Wi-Fi and that top PCIe by one expansion
slot I'd go with the Wi-Fi if you lose
if you use the lower PCIe by one slot
you lose a SATA port you get to choose
between the second full length PCIe x16
slot and your front panel USB 3.1 porch
I get to choose between the bottom full
length PCIe by 16 slot and a couple more
SATA ports and the vertical m dot 2 over
there as well as the u2 connector share
bandwidth and I'm not positive right now
I'm still waiting on word back from Asus
but that means that either you can't use
them at the same time or they're going
to split the bandwidth between them
giving you by two PCIe gen3 on each in
step by four and finally we have the
Auris X $2.99 gaming 7 and for the CPU
PCI Express Lanes gigabyte bucked the
trend here and ditches the two-way SLI
support with the KB Lake X CPU for this
round your top and slot is going to be
locked up by 8 and you can add another
by 4 connection with the third slot on
here the bottom slot just won't work at
all and the second slot is actually a by
4 connection that is shared with the
MDOT two slot that's right above it
this means that that m dot 2 slot is a
dedicated full bandwidth pcie 3.0 by 4 m
dot 2 connection directly to the CPU
which is cool but I wish that that slot
location wasn't right under the main GPU
location because it can get warm right
there also there's no access to it from
Intel Rapid Storage Technology 4 raid
setups because it's not read it through
the chipset so bear that in mind but
possibly a great option for like a
single boot drive or something like that
now because they only wire it up to m
dot 2 slots through the chipset though
that means there's less interference
with the SATA so you'll notice through
the chart here that you're not going to
lose too much SATA depending on what you
connect in you're only going to lose 4
SATA ports if you have to use that
bottom most m dot 2 slot so I think
those are all the configuration changes
for KB Lake X CPUs combined with these X
2 9 9 X 299 motherboards at least and I
don't blame you if you're just a little
confused let me reiterate that most of
these conflicts we've talked about today
will go away if you have a full fat
skylake X CPU with 44 PCIe lanes in one
of these boards but they'll start at
$1,000 for the 10 core 7900
twenty-eight Lane CPU should hopefully
be available soon as well to help bridge
that gap it does kind of suck that the
eight core only has twenty eight lanes
this time around but anyway I'm sure
there's much more to be said about this
launch this platform and everything else
in my opinion the KB Lake X CPUs still
don't make a whole lot of sense for this
platform Intel high-end desktop PCs are
supposed to be about maximum performance
and connectivity and you lose out on a
lot of that with a 70 640 X or 77 40 X
the main claim to fame of these CPUs is
overclocking and they do seem to be very
capable of hitting well above 5
gigahertz based on early tests I've seen
and some computers even with just a
decent air cooler or an all-in-one so
that's kind of cool so I'll recommend
this if you need a gaming PC consider
Intel's mainstream Z 270 platform or the
risin lineup from AMD you're going to
spend a lot less you're going to get
more bang for your buck if you really
really like overclocking or if you just
absolutely know that you love the
enthusiast platform and you want to get
in on it so you don't have that much
money right now and you just need
something to get you started but
especially plan on upgrading to a higher
core count CPU down the line especially
once those really high core count CPUs
are available later this year feel free
to jump in and have some fun just
remember that a and B has thread Ripper
lurking just around the corner promised
by the end of summer and supposedly it's
not going to have all this PCI Express
link confusion as all of their chips are
going to have 64 pcie 3.0 links waiting
to see how things play out in the next
couple months I think it's probably
going to be the smartest move you can
make thanks a lot for watching guys
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
