as and welcome to my PAX East moments
from pax east video we're starting here
we're not in taxis so this whole video
is a sham and Ally so far but we are at
LAX and we're getting ready to go to
Boston and amira steve is a very good
friend but we just want to show you the
first moment from this video which is
when you come to an airport we got a
cell phone and other devices and you
want to charge them it's always a
dilemma so far they be giving us these
charging stations but they never quite
enough plugs right so Steve and I have
come up with the solution for that so
many let me show you guys so this is the
verizon charging station here we got
these ports up here but uh oh yeah so we
got an extension going down to this so
we got everybody's phone is plugged in
here and I added another extension with
another thing here and then I'm going to
plug my phone into this Colletti to
charge it but yeah if anybody is at LAX
right now and you need to charge your
phone come join us moshi was hacked and
that I should change my password
what was hacked the potion oh yeah
change your password okay but we're in
boston now that's why hey we're in
boston this is our hotel room Steve's
giving some advice so so Steve wider
your gums bleed lot when you have
applause in a while this is a behind the
scenes of this behind-the-scenes
documentary about pax I feel like a dude
from home improvement so you don't have
Miss Taylor you know Tim I can give you
some good advice right now from the
other side of the fence Oh that'll go
and write yeah that guy were like I know
there I guess we'll do a quick hotel
room to her this is a very tiny hotel
room we're told it was built in like the
20s or something so that's pretty small
I mean it's got everything functionally
that you need but we discovered we got
here no wired internet connection no
Wi-Fi except for the one that you have
to pay 12 bucks a day for lame lame
anyway if we're gonna go get food yeah
now we're eating food this is food
delicious especially I feel had a long
bullying play there's an astute because
i'm not going to show antidote cuz
where's the one you can't edit herself
out of this one
these here looks like Steve it's another
variation why Steve time
hey everyone here's another another
limit from pax east and her thick hey
Nick hey how's it going good me
recording you with my phone recording me
without another mode for Maxie's to
Steve and b-roll we just got here it's
huge and impressive
that's what she said I met some new
friends pax east and he's must pause it
pause on we're all hardware

moments from facts we're getting an
elevator with Logan Logan's excited
Steve it's day to tighten too how you
feeling I am
doing okay Steve's hanging in there
everything

nothing like that idea
backstage at which wich is me
this is how you do a three day live
stream
grace week Stevie excited he's also be
excited saves energy
we're cleaning up the build God's ass
here
yeah that was an epic epic battle and
like so amazed
you did you actually put together the
whole working system with the horse pass
gun are you the head of course I have to
be great I did do this they weren't
healthy without
there's no way you're going to know it
so for the bands at home who might be
wanting to build
what are some
headers were actually possible said what
if we gonna do that
get used to feeling everything because
you can have
the notches on the processor memory like
drives
make sure you do
same plugin
graphics cards would be no make sure you
don't break
i'm very happy i did free
it was broken destro
it's my green yet it's like you're
all the other senses are idiots
central place was like amazing
excellent
elevator has become stairs sorry for the
convenience

my moments from pax east video I know

you a little bit of a taste of my trip
here to bosses like I'm ending today a
little trip through the historical
section of Boston that's Paul Revere up
