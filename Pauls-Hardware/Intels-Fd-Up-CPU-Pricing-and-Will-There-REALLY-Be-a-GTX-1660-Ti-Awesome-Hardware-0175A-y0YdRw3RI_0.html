didn't I didn't really have anything
anything to say did your mic did you
turn your mic up hacker one welcome to
awesome hardware this is a live show we
talk about technology I'm gonna go over
the stuff that's happened in the past
week in the tech world which dream every
Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m. Pacific
time you too twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and we also kind of split up
the show on YouTube so you're watching
the first half of episode number 175
that's on my channel Paul's Hardware
second half will be switching to Kyle's
channel bit wit that's linked in the
description but don't worry about that
for about 30-40 minutes and then later
on in the after party we're gonna do
what are we doing in the after party
we're playing games I'm gonna play a
game I downloaded Cod blopps for kal
download cob love's for and we all set
wave overwatch as well so we can I don't
think it finished it's what it stopped
but you can still play it the system
restarted or something like that but
battle minute I'll let you download it
right now it's gonna eat up all the
bandwidth no we got plenty of bandwidth
it's gonna I think we're 100 both ways
here well I guess the down shouldn't
matter exactly asked it overloads your
crappy writer no I right you have a nice
dry right now actually it's pretty
crappy if you guys enjoy the content
that we produce for YouTube then feel
free to check out our stores my stores
Paul's our Burnett and you can buy a
wide variety of high quality merchandise
featuring my my thumb screw logo as well
as some of the designs that have been
sent in by our wonderful fans like the
awesome hardware RGB everything this is
taking too long now I feel like this I
don't want to I'm gonna I'm gonna shut
down the blizzard shut that Blizzard
exit enough of that
not for that was it was it tanking were
we getting dropped frames or something I
don't know it just it took a while to
load my store and I wanted to show
people to RGB everything and I got
frustrated so I decided to take action
fair enough going on fair enough anyway
anyway the boss if you happen to buy
stuff during our show we will shout out
your name during the after-party
so stick around for that also
bit wit tech is Kyle store he also has a
wide variety of merch it all comes from
the same location so it's all real nice
thanks to you guys for help and support
our show and we hope you enjoy the
merchandise - yes we're gonna transition
just straight into the news from there
let's do it unless we don't have any
announcements we have one announcement
today hmm
what's that which is that we're off next
week oh yeah it's my fault I'm gonna be
doing a thing so sorry I won't come
around
hashtag blame Paul but we'll be back a
week after so don't worry about that
what am I gonna do I'll have the whole
Tuesday to myself you can work on your
house you got a new house yeah bill drew
Oh me build it up that's definitely
gonna be about make it make it good make
it a home make your house into a home
and a domicile and a living space and a
studio for awesome hardware yeah and you
can shoot there in a couple weeks I mean
ice tech news tech news
I shouldn't the transition is getting
let's do a new trance can we do like a
fun transition like let's do a wacky one
he's out elastic like a 90s transition
when I try ease out elastic okay what
elastic let's try that we're gonna use
that elastic demand news story whoa whoa
that's kind of I'm gonna do I'm gonna
dream now this one's from videocards
dot-com and it is about the seemingly
actually real but still a rumor but
these rumors keep happening so I guess
this is actually gonna be a thing the
nvidia geforce gtx 1660 TI i purposely
didn't read anything on this card
because i wanted to give my genuine
reaction to the news i'm about to hear
on the show like there's not a whole lot
more beyond stuff that's been rumored
recently it's just these rumors seem to
be growing more intense and if you
believe the fine folks over at video
cards calm the knot the vendors that
select the third-party ad in bored
manufacturers that they've been talking
to have been confirming that this 16 60
TI is actually a thing the name is not
yet fully confirmed but they say they've
heard it from two sources which and and
and round that up to three if you
include the source for this picture
which evidently they didn't just doctor
to say 16 60 TI it actually cuz cuz no
one could just type that
those letters and download the g-force
font yeah I mean like in Photoshop that
was a fan transition I hope you guys
know that's cool guys enjoyed that one
cool transition
oh but from what they have heard they do
have some base specs so it's based on a
new GPU the TU 116 which is going to be
the first turning based GPU under the
GTX brand so it won't feature any RT
course so no very tracing acceleration
supports but still 1536 CUDA cores which
is a decent amount although still a
decent amount less than the 2060 so as
you might expect it's going to come in
beneath the 20 the 20 60 by a decent
amount it still apparently has six gigs
of gddr3 though on 192 bit bus which is
the same as the 2060 there's no
information or word on if there's going
to be cut down memory variants like a
three gig version or a four gig version
for example that maybe even used slower
memory like gddr5 or gddr5 x if you
looked at what they did with the 1060
you might expect yeah they probably are
gonna do that but who knows for sure
we're still in the realm of rumor and
speculation at this point because none
of this is confirmed by Nvidia but it's
fun to talk about anyway
the r-tx 2060 certainly seems like a
reasonably compelling and somewhat
fairly priced graphics card so far for
what you're getting for it I would agree
a reasonable replacement to people who
were shopping for a 1070 or 1070 TI so
you know if Nvidia can price this
competitively then I guess all we have
to do is forgive them for the stupid why
is it a 1660 what is that where does
that number come from we had a 10 series
so we had a 1080 tenth we had a 1060 and
now we have the one T 80 2060 whatever
what was like let's what made them think
let's just add six hundred to the tenth
series and that's that's what will give
us our good for the TU 116 it's almost
like they they left the engineering team
in charge of marketing this card that
kind of seems like maybe maybe it's the
case I just never let the engineering
team name anything it will try like a
Liam Lee case like the only thing I can
think
they might have been thinking it's like
60 right the 60 series like if you go
back to like a GTX 260 or a 460 or 960
like those were always kind of their
middle-of-the-road
bread and butter lots of people can
afford it it gives you you know they try
to usually price it competitively so
maybe they're taking the later half is
not what I have if it were a 2 XT then
600 is like 10 times better
so 660 and that's what they were think
everyone's looking at 16 they're not
looking at the last three digits they're
looking at the first two because that's
how it's always been it's always been
the first to indicate sort of the the
generation and then the last to indicate
the sort of tier that generation 10 to
20 and then reverted to 16 they should
have just go with either 11 or done like
GTX 2050 that would have been nobody
would have given two shits what's wrong
with just GTX 2060 they haven't art yet
exactly just call it GTX sure I think
that's better they say there'd be some
confusion there because it's one letter
off I get one and think they were
getting the other it is one letter off
of its whatever who knows uh they're in
video they do what they want no rumor
launch dates for this rumored card but
there is another article from also video
cards calm with a ashes of the
singularity benchmark that was leaked so
this is just from the ashes of the
singularity database because if you
benchmark on ashes and you tell it to
upload it will upload to the database
and here you can see clearly listed in
video g-force gtx 660ti granted this
could be doctored and everything but the
source for this is the mysterious and
infamous to a person up to sack doom a
sec mother who's from bangkok which is
just a fun name of a city say Evan Deven
Cocteau MEP a sec from anyway open to
Bangkok the score I got was 7400 which
is 1200 points higher than you would
expect the GTX 1060 to score in this
although ashes of the singularity
benchmarks can be hard to compare
depending on the pre
being used in the system and all that
good stuff so as with everything here
since we're talking about a rumor
product all this could be false and we
might be lying to you but that's all we
have to say for that let's move on next
story which is about msi and msi his new
CEO did you meet MSI's new CEO i did not
did you no I did say hi to cliff cliff
cliff so what's up yeah yeah I was like
saying hi cliff cliffs awesome but uh
yeah Emma soget has a new CEO he's been
at the company for a while his name is
Charles Chang he started on January 1st
of this year so he's only been at the
job for about three weeks
he is a veteran MSI executive and he
served as executive vp as a desktop
platform solutions VP of R&amp;amp;D as well as
a VP which i think is associate VP
Thurston VP assistant to the view I
think a VP is alien versus Predator
alien versus Predator he's also
participated in alien versus Predator
serious role it's maybe he was an extra
he was probably one of the predators
he must have a lot of experience anyway
though he did a 30-minute interview with
Tom's Hardware the entire articles
linked in the description as well as all
the other articles I'm talking about
today so feel free to read the whole
thing because I'm not going to go over
all of it mainly had to talk about what
he said about Intel which is a little
bit of information that wasn't
necessarily out there before which is or
maybe just kind of what Intel's been
doing more recently which is the Intel
has been prioritizing supplying mobile
chips and data center chips over desktop
CPUs so whenever they have you know you
know they get it they print out the
wafers the wafer yes that's the word I'm
looking for word and they cut it up and
they say like all right these are good
ones and these are okay ones and
whatever they're slotting and they're
filling in the orders or the necessary
CPUs they need for mobile and server
which paint priority before or desktop
and that apparently it seems to be why
even though enthusiasm I feel like for
Intel's like 9,000 serious CPUs hasn't
been that high simply because they're
still very expensive they're still very
expensive prices haven't come down and
there still isn't always availability of
them so you have a weird situation
and we have a product that it doesn't
seem like a ton of people are interested
in there's still interest because
they're still good CPUs they're just the
the AMD pricing is very competitive
against them but according to to Charles
over here
part of the reason for that is just that
Intel hasn't really been providing the
desktop market with very many CPUs to
sell so that's led to when he says the
desktop market he's also including the
CPUs that are in some of their gaming
notebooks and stuff right not
necessarily so
so CPUs that are sold to be integrated
into systems for CPUs that are like
retail boxed or OAM tray I don't even
know if you can still buy OEM or tray
individual CPUs anymore like that but
the CPU you would buy if you wanted to
build a desktop computer that's why the
9900 K when it first launched which was
supposed to be worth thinking was gonna
be around 500 bucks so maybe low 500s
initially was selling for 570 or 590 ish
before it it's kind of dropped back down
and Chuck said the that that hurts their
sales their motherboards sales and if
it's affecting em aside that means it's
also affecting Asus and gigabyte in as
rock and and the other motherboard
manufacturers as well sure because you
have a mix of sort of maybe not as much
enthusiasm CPUs which are very expensive
so you're just gonna have less people
who have access to that cuz you know
like the most reasonable eight core if
you want an eight core CPU from intel on
their main stream platform you got to
spend like over 400 bucks right for a
9700 K yeah and if you want the 9900 K
you guys spend 530 and if no one's
buying the CPUs there sure as hell not
buying the motherboards that support
those cps it's like the buns are great
but the hot dogs are really overpriced
yet so the bun company's hurting right
now so the quote straight from chuck
analogies is that intel says let's start
at the data center first mobile second
desktop last and then they have the
higher I 9 and i7 processors and H skew
processors and then they do the you
scoop processors and then they do the
desktop processors the you scoop
yet the you skews the lower the lower
lower TDP versions gotcha now MSI and
the same interview says they they have
an issue haven't had issues getting CPUs
in
into their notebooks which makes sense
different ills prioritizing that or
their desktops but like I said that's
like in that's like a fully built
desktop solution right but they have
noticed it affecting their motherboard
sales and that the shortages have kept
DIY builders you know sort of in lurch
when it comes to finding the CPUs to buy
and then if you can't buy a CPU you're
not gonna buy a motherboard I think I
wonder if that means that maybe
motherboard manufacturers are gonna
start investing more money and Ardie
into their AMD motherboards and maybe
scale away a little bit from from the
Intel options if that's what's bringing
in the dough and that's what people are
buying that'll be interesting if you
might have more rise in am4 options or
whatever then LGA 1151 and whatnot and
injected did touch on that because AMD
I'm sorry MSI doesn't currently make AMD
based laptops or integrated desktop
computers but they do make a m4
motherboards in the next 399
motherboards so they've said the sales
of those have been doing very well yeah
I'm like I've recommended the B be 450
tomahawk is like a really solid board
it's only about a hundred and ten
hundred and fifteen dollars and it's a
great board too you could buy it as an
entry-level board and you can still use
it for one of the eight core CPUs and if
AMD is to be believed with that the
stuff they talked about it C yes
you're gonna be able to still have like
a B 450 by there board that you can slot
in one of their third gen rising CPUs
into because they're still staying with
a m4 as a socket so we'll see how that
works out they did say that production
of 40 nanometer Intel CPUs should be
ramping up over the course of the year
and the shortage issue should be fixed
by the fourth quarter which sounds like
a long way away given that it's January
and also sounds like when Intel said
they were supposed to start watching the
10 nanometer stuff mm-hmm
right which has been delayed for like
the past two or three years yeah so good
they're finally gonna have enough ninety
nine hundred case in stock by the time
they launch their next gen just in time
that's really good
hopefully will be any what doesn't
matter what price will be at that point
but like you said the am for stuff has
been doing well
comparatively so even though MSI doesn't
currently produce laptops or desktops
based on AMD products they are
considering it for the future and when
they consider something like that they
have to consider a range of stuff not
just like oh can we do this physically
get the products and make them and sell
them but they also have to consider like
long-standing relationships with Intel
and still share that which I'm sure
there's a lot of behind the scenes
talking that goes on but don't speculate
too much on that but that's pretty much
all I wanted to touch on for that story
main point there was the sort of
interesting way that Intel looks at the
CPU market when it comes to what they're
fulfilling first right it feels to me
like I mean I don't know if any Intel
marketing people out there watching but
like probably if they wanted to
recapture sort of the the the passionate
DIY markets which I feel like drives a
lot of sales in the other areas like
like you know all-in-one done
like like integrated desktops and
laptops I feel like they need to start
to sort of reassess that and be like
riot I don't know they just they need to
they need to lower their prices I feel
like in probably more competitive
Intel's too big to give a shit about us
I feel like they're just so massive to
really give two shits about this niche
market that granted you like you said
does branch out into all these other
markets and and and helps develop those
and helps grow the economy with within
those markets but it's also Intel and I
just feel like they have their their
hands in so many other pockets and they
have so many things so many other things
going that you know alright
the gamer building his own PC that's a
slice of the the pie chart this big of
what we encompassed oh yeah so if there
is further proof of this and just sort
of tying into the next story here this
is from an an tech that we talked about
these weird Intel CPUs that they have
teased they've they've listed some base
specifications for they are f skew CPUs
so at the same fsq the same skews here's
here's a list of them right here it's
the same skews as like a 9900 K but now
they put an F on the end and the F means
no graphics no integrated graphics we
talked about this on the live show and a
few weeks of your site like they're in
need so now there's a 9900 KF and 9700
KF and 9600 KF the only one on here that
doesn't have a non F variant is this 93
50 K
9350 KF which would sort of be the it's
kind of tied to the 8350 KF but it's
like five bucks more point being these
were sort of interesting and you'd be
like alright well that might be
interesting if it's a reasonably priced
it's not okay here these new CPUs just
like the old CPUs all the clock speeds
are the same less features just no
integrated graphics and the exact same
price 374 374 262 262 180 to 182 same
price for everything why would you ever
buy that then exactly why
so there's zero reason so two to two
points to make here
one is that Intel lists tray pricing or
they list the price that they sell in
bulk so the prices you see here like
four hundred eighty eight dollars $4.99
hundred K sure if you buy a 99 hundred K
at retail its 530 ish dollars right now
the retailer could sell it for life this
is what Intel sells in quantities of a
thousand sure so it might be that when
these CPUs actually do go up for sale
they might actually be 10 bucks less but
that's 10 bucks less that the reseller
is making because Intel sold them to the
reseller for the exact same exactly why
would have a drug the same price right
so this to me that just means like
alright I have zero interest that I mean
if I if my interest in these was minimal
before because I was like alright
no I GPU like do they overclocked really
well there's no indication of that
probably not it's really just a fused
off-eye GPU or possibly they're
harvesting chips that the AI GPU wasn't
fully functional or something
to try to get better yields but it's
like make these a value proposition give
people some reasons rights and by
advisories or to buy this over another
like there's a lot of people big oh yeah
I'm never gonna use the IP you I GP you
and a 9900 ko I'll say there's a 20
bucks 30 bucks yeah some reasonable
amount of like my god discount for a
month but now you're like alright no
it's the same price and you just don't
get that functionality it's like you
could get the combo with the fries and
the drink for five bucks or you could
just buy the burger itself for five
bucks and I've been in many situations
where the IGP you and an Intel
mainstream processor has come in very
handy
exactly even if you don't think that
you're gonna need ever get into trouble
shooting like exactly scarred is feeling
like well it's okay I can still use my
computer just not for gaming just switch
to the AI GPU that's that's actually
very nice failsafe so stupid Intel
that's lame this is Laurie so we'll go
through this a little bit more quickly
this one I guess is veering back a
little bit more towards the positive but
intel is planning to spend billions on a
new factory in Oregon billions this is
actually building out an existing factor
you're adding to it this is to support
to the next generation of CPU
manufacturing and they hope to begin
construction on this factory by the end
of June it would add an enormous third
section to their existing cutting-edge
Hillsboro research Factory which is
known as d1 X and it would has news
protection new production tools for
seven nanometer EUV based CPUs or
integrated circuits UV is extreme
ultraviolet lithography which is what
they're based in their their new CPUs on
the machines that that that manufacture
those chips cost about a hundred and
twenty million dollars each and
apparently they are the size of a bus I
don't know if they're actually shaped
like a bus and look like a bus but that
would be kind of funny okay if they did
the article largely sources the
information from people in Oregon's
construction industry because when
you're building something like this you
got to plan ahead and get get all your
permits in line and contractors but they
say that Intel is lining up contractors
and labor for
the project although depending on who
the article source talked to which is a
from Oregon live.com some of them said
that Intel's like super into this
committed to going forward others have
said that Intel did hedge in some
conversations so you know there's still
a little bit up in the air but it seems
like by June this year Intel should be
breaking ground on the new wing of this
Factory the d1x facility is already home
to Intel's most advanced research it's
where they crafted their next-gen CPUs
and then the last thing to point out is
that Intel doesn't have a CEO right now
since Brian Chris ganc retainage ranch
there's an advantage couldn't keep it in
his pants yeah he had that a consensual
affair but it was still stolen affair he
resigned he violated the Intel Terms of
Service yeah as a CEO he CEO Terms of
Service
gonna read the TOS fine fridge cannot
sleep with your secretary damn it you
always got to read the TOS guys no
update could just cost you your job but
back to the point that it it's it's hard
for a company to make a decision this
weighty without a CEO there to affirm it
but they might be announcing a new CEO
as soon as Thursday which is when they
are announcing their 2018 financial
results so for all you guys who are
invested in Intel or just super eager to
know who their new CEO might be keep an
ear to the ground
this Thursday because that seems like
when that information might be released
okay movie on couple more news stories
here this one just referencing you to
another in an tech article but this is a
review of Samsung's latest nvme SSD the
successor to the 970 Evo which is very
popular as a high-performance nvme SSD
which is very high performance also
tends to be a little bit more on the
expensive side although not quite as
expensive as their 970 Pro but the main
difference between the Evo plus and the
Evo is that they're using new and
they're using 96 layer 3d NAND flash
memory I remember
when I visited South Korea for the
Samsung event when they were first
launching three Dean and they were very
excited about it and they were like we
have a bunch of layers of the NAND we're
gonna add more layers and yes they have
followed through with that and done that
96 layer 3d and which apparently is not
only more dense but also performs a
little bit better than than the previous
three beam and they were working on so
the SSD doesn't have a new controller
they're using the existing controller
there are some performance gains the
article has detailed review stuff like
testing I ops and read and write
throughput and all that good stuff the
chart here kind of gives you your basic
idea looking at the various versions of
the drive it comes in 250 gig 500 gig
and 1 terabyte capacities right now
there's a 2 terabyte version that's come
out in April and you can see the read
and write speeds pretty good about 350
to 500 megabytes per second for your
sequential reads and then they've got
sequential write speeds because there's
an SLC portion of the drive and a TLC
portion and depending on whether or not
you've used up that buffer you'll get
much better write speeds they slow down
a bit all the way down to foreigner'
megabytes per second for the Turner
gating version overall though in antec
was impressed with this drive and they
said that it's basically like taking one
of the fastest ELC drives around and
making it slightly a slightly better
deal cool so there you go that's that's
good if you are about to buy a new
high-speed nvme SSD you should be happy
that this is now available if you bob a
samsung 970 evo within the past month
you punch yourself in the face should
waited for this it's not quite that bad
prices our prices are reasonable it's
still about twice as much price per gig
as you'd pay for like a later rev3 throw
a SATA rf3 drive but 90 bucks for a 250
gig version 130 bucks
for the 500 gig version 250 bucks for
the one terabyte version that's not bad
and that's the that's the out of the
gate prices so maybe we'll see some
discounts on that and not bad for nvme
and just like the ease of installation
less fuss and higher speeds all that
yeah and very nice get in the high-speed
nvme drive in there for like your main
up
system drive there there's their super
smooth super smooth or the really fast
ones it's it's a harder sell for
somebody who's buying who's like
building a budget PC yes you need this
yeah good luck using that all tangible
benefits start to fall off when right
once you jump into the nvme SSD range
but um this this seems like you know a
slightly more a slight bit of an
equalizer when it comes to that that
higher range Samsung SSD teams just
they're on fire they have been for many
years now oh yeah they do it they got
that they got that vertical integration
indeed alright one more story one final
start here in the news segment and this
one is just sort of something I wanted
to show you guys came across this this
is from the blue blur blur the blue
gives me the blur blasters Buster's
website and I stopped a bunch of
monitors at at Computex Cal did you see
many monitors at Computex yes I did
man the blur Busters site is so so
useful is this weird over left here
that's bothering me besides nothing
makes you want to like close it like
it's a pop-up or something your spidey
senses kick in you're like pop up
destroy destroy cannot the the main
point here is there are now smartphone
cameras that can record at a very high
refresh rate there are now also led LED
monitors that have very high refresh
rates what as well here's a recording of
a monitor refreshing this is an LED and
it's a seven second video so it goes by
very quickly
you might notice right the beginning of
the video is regular speed and then it
slows down to 960 FPS at what point
there oh right there
are you seeing oh wow fast slow now
notice how notice the clear delineation
any monitor that's that's that's drawing
the image is going to draw from top to
bottom that's right that's typically how
monitors do it nothing right that's why
you get tearing yes you have a refresh
rate of the monitor that's different
than the refresh rate that your GPU
spitting it yeah but you're also dealing
with pixel response time it's usually
measured in graded gray
below on this video that you can see a
similar the same test being run with a
IPS else LCD IPS LCD s have much slower
response time so when it slows down
notice all of the ghosting that's
happening so as one image is being
replaced with the other yeah the pixel
that's responding to change to the other
color isn't responding fast enough so
you get this ghosting that overlaps
itself too sure this is an LED and you
can just it's just much crisper and
that's that's a better thing so it's
gonna be good for like high motion
picture right so like maybe we if you're
watching sports or playing a fast-paced
game where ghosting is more perceivable
perceived yes okay also showing that led
as the sort of you know still looking to
o LED as the monitor panel technology of
the future it's going to bring a lot of
cool stuff o LED has been getting sort
of a bad rap because it is it is
susceptible to burning yeah but with the
right technology and the monitors that
are being coming out which also fault as
mentioned in the article they have
confirmed that there are a bunch of
there's a bunch of monitor companies
working on LED gaming displays but LED
displays can have a response a great a
great response time of about 0.1
milliseconds 0.1 it's versus like just
one or two good fast IPS is maybe five
milliseconds and maybe two to three
milliseconds if you're talking gutter
ones are like if you get into the TN
range but then you sacrifice color
depths and stuff like that so I guess
just want to show that because I thought
it was a good side by side demonstration
and also hopefully you know a
forward-looking thing that LED displays
in the future will be awesome I love me
some deeper black so yeah trying to get
back to that to that response time that
CRTs you to have used to have and maybe
finally convincing some of these CRT
users who still cling to that too
to move to something else but it has to
be something better
all right whatever course I have a new
segment I have one more segment and its
new I'm excited
I've made a lower third for it it's
called axed axed that what that's about
it's about axes do we do we take a look
and review different axes for what
happens I'm it's like a lumberjack just
I like it I gonna I like my little
shorter nice you gotta yeah we asked big
axe there i I'm an accident like your
heads ready Paul I recently converted to
axe don't assume not this is not at all
associated with extra body by the way
identify sponsor or anything identify
his axe yeah
talisman X now axis is we're talking
about things that have been ended ended
cuff axed starting with cart Anna got it
huge Microsoft Cortana and Windows 10 is
getting the axe man late is finally
splitting their search and voice
assistant as can be clearly seen in this
mspaint demonstration here from Engadget
the search bar now is separated from
Cortana Cortana is over here by itself
Cortana will pop up every time you do a
search and be like I want to cry
tenderize your search and you'd be like
carte Anna I told you when I installed
Windows 10 yeah I don't want you
snooping around and following me and
reporting back to what I'm going to do
it anyway
fucker so that's cool Microsoft has been
working on improving the search function
because let's face it that's one of the
primary functions of the operating
system that people tend to appreciate I
know the search function with Windows 7
something I used all the time I could
hit the Windows key and start typing in
most of them like whatever I wanted and
usually find what I wanted to get to
pretty quickly right Windows 10 has
varied in its efficacy at doing that
type of thing sure but perhaps this is
the beginning of getting it back to that
Windows 7 functionality right
this update should go live for everyone
in the next major windows update that is
planned for April no word on if it's
going to be called
creators up to the what are they gonna
the youtubers update they need to come
up with fancy like YouTube creative
names for all their windows updates if
they really want people to embrace them
I still won't but yet Microsoft has also
expressed some interest in integrating
Cortana as a I forget the word it's it's
like Alexa and Google assistants like a
smarter systems like an assistants
assistant it's like a plug in choices in
short oh they are trying to still keep
it as a thing that way sure that it
would be a a supplement to Google
assistance or Alexa rather than a
standalone competitor right so you can
use like either/or like you could you
like some would be what do you mean like
a like big but it seems to be a you
being Alexa have Cortana you know do a
bunch of see if she's got a network of
duplicate systems that have to that you
can't just go through one person now
yeah it's like playing telephone Google
assistants but what happens if you're
like it's like playing telephone I'm
here
Alexa tell Cortana to tell Google or
Tana tell Cortana to tell Alexa to tell
Google assistant to turn on the lights
and then like I don't know it starts
your laundry machine or some shit oh
fuck sorry and I dropped the ball there
I apologize for calling to Alexa I don't
have any Alexa or Google devices so you
have any Google devices really I mean my
phone speaker now they're very handy
very handy when you're listening to
music and stuff I mean your phone does
the same thing but it doesn't sound as
good and it's just I haven't gotten to
the point where I'm like I need that
yeah you don't need it no one know who
needs Google assistant it's to me
obvious that it's sitting there
recording the whole time wish which
granted but you can turn the mic up
doing you can I know you alright funny
story though have a beer yeah you may in
fact I'm forcing you to heaven here
funny story though this is a great beer
up story overfilling beer the other day
actually just this week wifey sauce was
in our room we have a fan that
run it's like a Dyson fan to cool the
room when we're sleeping at night we
like the white noise and stuff and she
walked through the room the other day
and the fan was on and she said okay G
Google turn off the fan and she was like
why isn't it working and little bit she
and then she quickly realized it's not a
smart enabled fan it's just a regular
fan you need to plug the fan into a
smart plug and when she told me that
story I was like I've never been so
disappointed in us as a society and also
in Dyson for not having a smart fan
smart hateful dumb fan I thought it was
funny I thought I wasn't funny so you
know you can just get the parish trip
with the smart plug and then you just
seek of course right yeah I don't think
even I don't think wifey sauce even
knows those exists so I mean she's she
could have created that whole idea
that's the beer update this is a bourbon
fans supply to beer it is who sent this
in fan this was number one fan in the
mail time we did John Doe earlier in
December
police are still remaining though so
this is from magnify Brewing Company
from New Jersey yep Joisey and this is
reason this is called through the use of
technology which was very appropriate
Imperial stuffed with maraschino
cherries vanilla coconut and hazelnut
Kyle has already been drinking this it's
really good said it's pretty taste to be
fair he sent me the fan also sent us
some double IPA which I was not a fan of
I don't know if it just came flat it
tasted very flat and I'm very hoppy
flavor wasn't all there not my favorite
but so I was really skeptical to try
this from the same brewery very very
pleasantly surprised
they've been are these super redemptions
Red Dead Redemption super in red
probably shouldn't be drinking a second
one because it's 11 freakin percent but
when in Rome no that is just tasty okay
all right what next moving on with X so
I can finish my half of the show yeah
machinima
did you hear about this machine yeah I
did I'm a cinema
sorry headphone users sorry sorry
headphone users machinima it was
sort of a conglomerate YouTube channel
they had a bunch of different creators
that worked for them and just this past
week the channel has been basically
scrubbed scrubbed if you go to the
machinery they went down a YouTube
channel it's so dark all the videos are
gone and it's just a wasteland of this
kind of thing with the YouTube thing
where I'd like the video is not actually
there's very very sad but they got
bought up didn't they yeah so they had
there were seven plus years of videos on
machinima a variety of creators involved
a lot of those creators left over the
years and went on and did their own
things there's a few of them I followed
from from time to time I can't claim to
have been a huge longtime fan of
machinima but I've definitely been very
aware of their existence for a very long
time of course one of the oldest biggest
YouTube channel networks ever so most of
the videos on the channel have now been
set to private so they are unplayable
they did not notify anyone not the
creators of the original videos
themselves or the users of the channel
that this content was going away a bit
of the history as Kyle was referring to
machinima was acquired in 2016 about
three years ago by Warner digital
networks warner digital networks was
then bought by AT&amp;amp;T two years later in
the summer of 2018 the channel was then
shuttled over to full screen since they
were bought by AT&amp;amp;T cuz 18t owns full
screen right colored me and Kyle
surprising I had no idea they were both
murdered with we're both partnered with
full screen so we're both partnered with
18t now we're both you can hear a pin
drop
what is it think that's good that goes a
little far away far way too far back
AT&amp;amp;T 18t our logo looks like the Death
Star I don't know I don't know else to
say
seeing that internal it so anyway
fullscreen is serviced as is is operated
by otter media arter media quoted in
this Engadget article said we're focused
on creating new content with the
machinima team which will be distributed
on new channels to be announced in the
coming months
the meantime the Machinima network of
creator channels continues to showcase
the talents of the network as part of
this focus on new content we have
pivoted from distributing content on a
handful of legacy operated channels so
that's a corporate speaker it really is
basically we've cancelled all these
creators that you used to watch yeah we
in the way they're saying we've had
favorite videos they're gone we axed him
yeah we asked a bunch of people but
we've pivoted from distributing content
on a handful of legacy operated channels
let's just phrase it in a way that
sounds professional and confusing enough
to trick the average Joe so they don't
know that we're really just saying axing
all these fuckers I just have to imagine
they're not a lot you know at some level
there's a business decision that's being
made here and someone's told like look
this is all their this is our plans for
the future and from their perspective
they must look at it like the existing
stuff that's there somehow two tracks
from what we want to do in the future
and then like that that's the only
logical explanation I can come it's
interesting to me is that they they felt
it was necessary to privatize seven
years worth of videos and like like
that's how far away the current
machinima was from their vision was I
think they had to completely start from
a clean slate they couldn't just leave
those videos up and just like no one
would give to in my opinion no one would
give two shits or even notice if they
just started adding different types of
videos to the channel people just be
like oh this is the type of content
they're creating now whether they agree
with it or not this is what it is but
somehow they felt the need to just
privatize seven years worth of videos
and and start fresh which is weird to me
maybe there's some legal thing there and
they didn't want those videos to be
monetized anymore or like generate any
revenue just to monetize them is there's
videos I'm sure that people are like
really bummed out they can't watch
anymore on machinima and I'm sure
there's plenty of content that was still
getting views even years later of course
we're going back to it or you know for
whatever reason so yeah I don't
understand this decision but machinima
you know four went out for the homies
and we're sorry for any of the creators
who you know who enjoyed the content
there I hope they backed it up in the in
themselves this was the first time I
personally had looked at something had
been like right I upload all of my
videos to YouTube I also have all of my
final renders like every video that I've
rendered are all saved personally it
could really I wanted to and I'm this is
the first time I'm like yeah that's a
good policy for to do that because you
know who knows yeah we don't own YouTube
and at some point so they could decide
like we're shutting all this stuff off
right as of whatever stupid reason they
come up with but yeah well we'll fight
well fight tooth and nail before we let
that happen
damn oh damn right exactly a lot of that
quick I've got a fight a lot of fight
left in me one last story here for axed
Star Wars game being developed by EA I
like I like Star Wars YouTube
granted can be a little oversaturated
now that any Disney owns the IP in there
they're pushing it hard but actually
kind of like that there is no Star Wars
movie this year I feel like that kind of
it was kind of like a breath of fresh
air it's following the way of Marvel
like having like a New Avengers every
year or like you know a new Marvel movie
there's just okay yeah just good enough
getting a bit too much so it's no cash
grab you know for whatever reasons
they've eased up on it and we're not
gonna go into that but Star Wars games
historically especially if you go back
to before they were licensing to EA and
and other companies like that they were
often quite nice sure Knights of the Old
Republic range another one there's a
very love very beloved and there were
many different Star Wars games LucasArts
is often very forthright in allowing
their IP to be used in different ways
but they've had more exclusive contracts
with various companies more recently
sure EA has proven that they really
should not be trusted with Star Wars and
this is just further evidence of that
this game has been in development
development for quite a while was being
developed by EA Vancouver
a Vancouver's a pretty large studio they
supports a variety of EA Games including
FIFA and Battlefront they've been
working on this open-world Star Wars
game since October 2017
that was when EA bought and then closed
visceral games prior to that visceral
games who developed games like the dead
space horror series had been developing
its own Star Wars game which is
codenamed ragtag which was a linear
action adventure game directed by
uncharted director Amy Hennig I haven't
played the tenets of Uncharted games
they're good but the ones that I have
played have been quite entertaining
they're very good so that association
makes me think like that is some problem
what's the word I'm looking for some
possibilities there yeah yeah
now when EA Vancouver took over visceral
it rebooted this Star Wars project
entirely keeping some of the art assets
but transforming it into an open-world
game so they kind of changed the game
they kind of rebooted it they kind of
started over but now that project is
also canceled and that's what the
article here is covering EA Vancouver's
now-cancelled open-world Star Wars game
was codenamed Orca it was very early in
development since they rebooted it
obviously they didn't go with what
visceral was originally working on but
it involved playing as a scoundrel or
bounty hunters like a han Solo type
character who could explore various
open-world planets and work with
different different factions across the
Star Wars universe sound sounds like a
reasonable premise for a game could be
interesting
but when EA's top decision makers looked
at their roadmap for the next few years
they decided that they needed something
earlier than the planned release date
for Orca according to people familiar
with what happened so they canceled work
and favorite in favor of a smaller scale
Star Wars project that's now aimed for a
much sooner likely late 2020 which also
just happens to be around the time that
the next-gen consoles are supposed to
launch ahh
so EA was like roadmap we want a Star
Wars title launching along with the next
gen consoles presumably according to the
article
this star wars games that they're
currently developing sounds very cool
but I'm gonna take way too long you know
the they're gonna try to develop a game
with depth right and an immersion and
you know attention to detail subs we
want something that we can ship along
with the launch of these consoles
therefore that we want some crap where
you can shit out and six months yes I
mean just give it to some like mobile
game variant or something like that you
want clash of clans but just skin with
Star Wars shakes out so
can you do that the only silver lining
to this article is that they did not
actually fire anyone from the studio
from EA Vancouver so they get to keep
their job that is positive and they've
just been shifted over working on
different stuff yeah but open-world Star
Wars game that was in development is now
gone that's been axed along with all the
other stuff that's been axed axed you
just been axed you know it's kind of
look at that ax is a bittersweet feeling
this this segment because any any topic
or any IP that you bring up honest on
this segment I can instantly just not
care about or listen listen about how or
be invested in because I know you know
it's gonna be axed said it's gonna be
axed right from the get-go
thanks plants Paul that's such a good
cycle to coincide very nicely with oh
joy depending on the guys that wraps it
up for my half thank God I update
Hardware number 175 and to burn a hole
in that urinal side a where do you
continue on Kyle's half of the show once
he's taken a piss oh yeah so a link to
that is in the video description if
you're watching this on youtube also
down in the comments is usually
timestamps which if you watched at this
point in the video is probably
completely useless to you but true we'd
like to say thank you to our time stamp
makers they're very wonderful people and
in the meantime thank you guys so much
thanks to sell our moderator for
moderating hey so I want to squeal to
Republic Commander anyway but that's all
for this half thanks guys we'll be our
back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
