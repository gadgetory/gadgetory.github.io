hello Oh what is that it looks fun let's
follow 76 oh that's a never mind stupid
it's just it's just it just looks cool
it actually sucks at least from the few
tweets I've read about it
trailers always look good okay can't
trust the trailer
hello welcome everyone just wetting my
beak hello everyone and as Kyle just
said welcome thanks for joining us this
is awesome hardware it's a livestream
about technology we discuss technology
computer parts other random stuff too I
was team every Tuesday evening to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware as well
as our individual YouTube channels you
watching the first half of episode
number 169 a o 69 dude which is
streaming to my channel Paul's hardware
and about 30 40 minutes or so we'll
switch to the second half on Kyle's
channel which is bit wit which is linked
in the description as well as a link to
the after party which we will do at the
end where there will be much debauchery
in the meantime quick word of warning we
do occasionally use foul language adult
language on the show it's not like all
the time chickens but we just wanted to
let any youngsters out there through
sensitive ears no cows are already
getting started we also drink beer on
the show feel free to join us if you
adult and drink responsibly and all that
good stuff and of course thank you once
again for joining us on this evenings
episode of awesome harder Cheers
okay a quick plug for our stores if you
like what we do and you wanna help
support us and also buy yourself some
nice merch check out the stores we got a
new design a new awesome hardware design
we do submitted by J Ted JTED right
there he's right ed he did this artwork
back when we did the logo design contest
it it initially slipped through the gaps
we took another look at it and we're
like we we actually really liked it yeah
it has been transcribed and put onto the
hoodie for you guys feel free to buy it
from either of our stores we split the
profits either way and
we just thought that was really cool I
love that I love this design because
it's first of all if you can't tell what
you should be able to it's an exploded
sort of view
cartoonish view of a PC yeah and it's
got it's got so much detail in it it's
one of those designs that you can
literally look at a hundred times and
still see new things like I just now
realize that Paul and I are standing on
the radiator is the bottom bottom right
corner there it's it's like gifts that
keep on giving yeah and it also kind of
follows a theme with like components
that that are sort of animated and
personified with little faces kind of
like both both those designs that can be
currently found on Paul a nice store so
you can pick up one we really like this
design and hopefully we can get a couple
of these shirts in here
that's the studio's that's the airmen
show on the show good good cow thank you
I'm trying though you were you're doing
very good eyes doing their job doing
doing both of our jobs
I've got olive green t-shirts I also
have a bunch of lightweight hoodies too
so check out my store pulse over at net
Cal stores bit with tech slash store and
again we got the Robo love shirts
t-shirts hoodies all kinds of good stuff
Cal's also got hoodies available unique
designs it's it's cold out all these
days buy a hoodie damn it
you're cold as shit prepare yourself for
the holidays you need you need that in
your life all right Louis warmest seed
with fire the news the news related in
some degree to technology yeah and
starting off with an article posted over
to WCC F tech now WCC F tech note aureus
infamous if you will for posting
informational articles with information
potentially sometimes of dubious nature
so we always like to say take a grain of
salt or take the information with a
grain of salt
I mean sometimes they post true stuff
too so we got to give him credit for
that now this is an article by use
monitor SATA which is about Radeon rx
Navi and I'm pretty sure this was put
together I don't think this is official
AMD logo stuff or anything like that
because this is a supposedly and
exclusive but some first
AMD Navi GPU information and honestly
the information is that it has 40
compute units exclusive as in like WCF
tech gets an exclusive
know it put exclusive at the beginning
of the article it makes it more
important in special keywords SEO
I mean usual aunty blah Blee it means
that the outlet has some reasonable
means of expecting that they are the
first to publish this disinformation
right well when you make up all your
stories you can be the first to publish
anything whoa
zing burn just kidding um but yeah
honestly honestly like this Guzman did a
great job kind of kind of padding
material to this article leave you the
actual information is forty compute
units which is good which is good to
know it's a good to know that as forty
computing it's also the codename that's
the second thing now v12 which is
slightly different than the expectation
right the code name would be ten if they
went with like the Polaris naming
schemes that they'd done whether they've
done like ten twenty thirty you would
expect it to be 10 knots well so there
was a little bit of confusion about that
potential speculation as to where this
GPU is gonna end up but um also
speculation as to the total number of
stream processors which if it uses the
same ratio of stream processors to
compute units that GCN architecture has
been using it would be 64 per compute
unit which would give you a total of
2,560 stream processors but that is
speculation other than that na'vi 12 was
not going to be the GPU that gets
featured in the playstation 5
although na'vi is the architecture that
AMD has said is what they're developing
the playstation 5 GP with just not maybe
this specific one it'll probably be not
quite as I don't know
it'll just be its own thing yes percent
sure this would be an upgrade from
Polaris 30 it would probably go into a
Radeon 600 series of GPUs Radeon 680 rx
680 maybe something like that 600 just
seems so much less or so much fewer than
2080
or 2,000 but you have to also remember
that both both sides whether you're
talking AMD or ATI and NVIDIA have had
both they've done four-digit numbers and
they both done three-digit number I know
these variations I know so it's the
marketing the marketing bullshit is
getting to me 600 I mean it's confusing
order you have end up having to readers
and everything yeah but anyway is this
actually going to be a product that
launches maybe early estimates put it at
the first half of 2019 so next year
which isn't that far off if we're
already in mid-november right now and
then there are some some more points
made at the end of the article
specifically to AMD's roadmap again this
is just from WCF tech so it might be
true might not but we'll read it anyway
Vega 7 nanometre will not be coming to
gamers Oh they've recently done some
stuff with Vega 7 nanometre chances are
that's going to go into their machine
intelligence and then the machine
learning stuff first before we see it in
AGP that's made for gamers but the Navi
12 it says will be a small GPU based on
seven nanometer so that's appears to
contradict the bullet point before it um
but I guess I think so about Nobby 10
Bobby told you the first time be part
trigger I arrived in the first at 20 19
havi 10 has been either scrapped or will
follow later on depending on a couple of
factors the performance of this part
will be equal to Big O I'm sorry nah be
not be 10 right see I should read the
full sentence first before I ah cast
aspersions on it alright so now B 10
might still be around and would be 7
nanometre right now B 12 minutes happy
maybe that's why it's called a b12
because it's Nobby
nanometre yeah that would make sense hey
see we've seen you heard it here first
guys this is exclusive it was mod to dot
point that out I don't think he said
that anywhere here that not be 12 the 12
might refer to 12 nanometer see since
this is right
since when do tech naming schemes make
sense
through that has a breakthrough that
they're supposed to MIT not make sense
and just be confusing that's readable
the trend that's right up there with my
recommendation which came after the fact
when AMD released Rison which was that
AMD really should have done instead of
rising three five and seven
matching Intel's oh yeah core i3 five to
four inches and risin no four six and
eight to me one up when you have rising
four six and eight which would be a
number above what Intel had higher
number that's better and rise in four
rise in six and rise at eight could
match up to the number of cores in each
CPU ah it's a no-brainer but ambe's like
now we don't do that we're gonna copy
Intel I think you found your calling
Paul you belonging right now or can I
should I mean hey until the YouTube
thing falls through anyway though just
splash beer and opportunity in glasses
you can have that one for free AMD yep
just so you know you told them thanks to
them it's time they could do that with
like the next generation yeah I know
gonna be interesting
all right other than that moving on this
morning at 6 a.m. Pacific Standard Time
the embargo lifted for the new Intel
Core i $9.99 80 x ii the extreme edition
the successor to the 79 80 XC previous
top-end 18 core processor available on
Intel's LJ 2066 platform 4 X 299
motherboards and a bunch of people
tested it and everyone was like man hmm
for $2,000 oh yeah I have to I have to
say I was I was somewhat impressed with
the universal Matt response of this but
it's somewhat expected I had a really
really short amount of time to do my
video on I ever saw it I did not do a
full review video like I would normally
do just kind of did what I could do
yesterday but there were quite a few
other people did full reviews and tests
on it it's really really really really
really similar to the 79 80 XE it's the
same price that's still 40 nanometer
it does have a soldered IHS rather than
not soldered so that potentially gives
it a little bit better cooling
performance but Intel's still being
tricky with their turbo boost tables and
not being completely forthright with
those and how they work and what it runs
at out of the box it runs at a pretty
conservative frequency 3 gigahertz base
but I found it actually ran it less than
that depending on what instruction sets
are being used and everything um
but still what was the lowest it was
running at two point eight two point we
got Hertz for me yeah but still if you
take a ninety nine eight exe at stock
and you run it any compare it to a 79 80
XC at stock it will be a little bit
faster but if you run them both at the
same frequency they're essentially the
same we've seen this before it's like if
you took a skylake 6700 canned a 70 cent
and a KB like 7700 K you had clocked
them the same they're the same yeah
the same inside sure so it is another
option that's out there present' intel's
new motto same inside it's the same
inside we've made no changes just we
don't we jacked up that product SKU name
by 2000 which gives the impression that
it's 2000 faster the only thing
different is the price no the price is
the same - I mean if you want to give
them credit they at least what I've been
charged more 7700 cave excuse me
so this thing is supposed to be not as
great of a like liquid cooled
overclocking chip right as the 79 80 XE
yeah so was that true I mean so so I
actually did watch all the main reviews
though about not I want to say all I
can't say that but I watched hardware
connects and gamers Texas and Starbucks
hardware unboxed
and I read a few articles on this and
stuff just just sort of get an
assessment of kind of kind of what the
what was going on and there are a few
specific things that were pointed out so
Steve from gamers Nexus pointed out that
the solder that they're using with these
new 9000 series processors like the 9900
Kay and everything it's it's a better
solution than the crappy thermal paste
that they were using before but you can
still get better performance by deleting
and using liquid metal but it's a lot
harder to delete a soldered processor
and I don't know that anyone has
attempted that with their $2,000
engineering sample CPUs that Intel has
sent out so it's harder in the sense
where you risk more there's a higher
risk of damaging there's a high risk of
damaging it um and remains to be seen
with these CPUs because there's not a
whole lot of them out there and I don't
like I said I don't know very many
people who tried it yet I don't know
after Bauer has gone it Steve de linhas
no I don't believe so I got in there and
there it must be missed it must be
really hard to do it if Steve hasn't
deleted his yes useless like one of the
first things I mean it may be something
that he's there doing a live stream to
day after tomorrow I think yeah where
they're gonna overclock it I don't know
if he's gonna do it prior to that or
anything but point being all else being
equal the 79-80 XE might be a better
choice for somebody who's interested in
extreme overclocking because it's much
it's a much easier process to delayed
and replace the thermal material versus
the 99 80 XE whereas the 90 90 DX e you
would expect to have the highest min
chips until is is cranking out for these
processors so it's the highest end
overclocking people are gonna do Ellen
to stuff and whatever for people who try
to like break World Records you're
probably gonna see that being done on
this processor but right it's kind of
funny how the whole that whole thing
that whole feature sort of bit us in the
ass
we're like the whole time we were just
ranting and raving like slaughtered Tim
slaughtered today we're probably getting
Sun or Tim and then in the end we find
out like actually it's not as good as as
we thought and it's actually making the
deal in process to make things better
more difficult well that's excuse me I'm
that's kind of a night shyamalan like
I'm sure I know in some instances it is
it is better for people who don't want
to deal it it's also like the question
of like counterbore how much better is
it like if you can get any improvements
then then there's gonna be some people
who are interested in deleting even if
it's a soldered chip right um but the
variance in and the difference between
doing that not is that's that's what
it's gonna come down to that's sure
we'll have to see how many people it's
never what it seems they're gonna attack
their $2,000 $79.99 ATX II and I tried
to do the literate and let's see how
that goes in the future but yeah other
than that yeah everyone with $2,000
you'd attend nothing else to do is go go
don't buy one of those there's actually
there that's another thing I pointed out
there's there's a very cost-effective
potential option in the 9900 K if you're
going for stuff that really likes single
thread performance and high frequency
and of course thread rippers there if
you do need the high court count stuff
at a much much more reasonable price -
price per core or price price - Rossi
Piedmont might be a while - you can get
it for a reasonable price though
reasonable from the 900k oh yeah yeah I
mean the ninety-nine hundred K is a
reasonable option to just go out and buy
right now that yeah that might be even
less Oh ran that yeah the girl with her
name is under going for like seven eight
hundred dollars yeah that's pretty silly
okay moving on though more news this is
from OC 3d net and they were actually
following up on an article posted by the
Japanese gaming website for gamer who
interviewed the RTGS
Radeon technology groups senior vice
president of engineering seen here David
Wang OC 3d followed up to clarify some
of the stuff that had been posted
because the Jap the original article
which was in Japanese was had some robo
translators that translated it into
English
and you had some miscommunication going
on about what was actually being said
and what AMD is expecting so to clarify
some people were saying that AMD was
saying that they're not going to have
ray tracing support until all of their
cards have ray tracing support which is
a little weird but OSI 3d contacted this
dude on Twitter who's a native Japanese
speaker and he went and did a more
direct translation mr. Wang was
basically saying that AMD will
definitely respond to the XR DirectX ray
tracing after proposing that this is a
personal view but for the time being AMD
is providing it free of charge
what providing ray tracing
I guess support for DX are like that's
just something that in the next in the
next upcoming generation of graphics
card it will just be there maybe that
ties in with the fact that they'll have
it support on every card like even the
low end will like you wanted to pay a
premium it won't just be on the high end
car yeah that makes sense
or like that would make sense as a sort
of a little dig at Nvidia and saying
like you're not gonna have to pay $800
plus for the RT X series of grace that
actually have this support it also
sounds like they're trying to like make
an excuse to delay it further like oh
well we have to wait for every single
card to have it that's why that was that
was it that was not that's not true
those knows of a miscommunication oh oh
was that actually I didn't read this at
all so is that something that was
brought up that's what I said oh sorry
sorry I was reading chat that originally
there was a rich they were originally
says why don't we check Robo translated
articles oh we're from the original
Japanese article uh-huh that gave people
the impression that he was saying that I
see but it doesn't have been clarified
that that's not what he's saying he's
just saying that yes we do expect to
have our tech support in upcoming AMD
Radeon products not a whole lot of
further detail beyond that just that yes
it's something I'm working on something
they're gonna do you did say that for
now they are focusing on improving the
offline CD production environment
centered on Radeon Pro render
so is it going to be more sofa okay yeah
so they do have a ready I guess more
specific solution as compared to the
direct X ray tracing which is DirectX so
Windows but yeah I mean just just a
little bit update for anyone who's super
impressed by all the ray tracing stuff
okay so far we have we even seen it in
action in a real world environment
that's not an Nvidia demo still haven't
I don't think we have Oh God go away
okay all right that's all we have for
that
next up Amazon let's picked two new
locations for their two new headquarters
the moon HQ 2 is gonna be to Mars Hughes
we got New York City okay and we got
Northern Virginia close second Northern
Virginia okay and then there's also a
location that's gonna be opened up in
Nashville Tennessee we will create more
than 5,000 jobs so like I was I was
seeing people this was all over this is
blowing up on Twitter today and it's
it's interesting to read about it's like
you can take the you can take Amazon
site and be like yes they're expanding
and prospering and spreading drop jobs
the company plans to employ more than
25,000 people at each location it's a
job jobs that's good but the amount of
government subsidies that they are
getting is just is just absolutely
ridiculous which which was in the
article somewhere which is the
government giving them five billion
dollars no they're gonna spend five
billion Amazon I thought I was gonna I
thought it was listed in this article I
actually don't have notes on this
article which is why I'm I'm not pulling
this information up immediately
those look like that I can do or but a
giant but this is Amazon headquarters in
Seattle by the way that boobs are but
would you vote it's a throne Enchantix
boobs yeah they got a bunch of
government subsidies so you know that's
a part of it
but sure what I'm being wouldn't want
their HQ in their country or city Amazon
they will soon rule us all hail hell
Bay's us and no that's not true
Amazon is too big they're no they're not
I don't know it's like a sometimes I try
to I try to get a grasp on like global
economics and stuff and like him like I
could figure this out make some
suggestions for how it should work
no it's to global that's too big to it's
I can't think using I can't think on
that it's not doing during the show this
show is not about solutions you know we
haven't done a lot talk about problems
we haven't done them haven't done oh joy
I should bring that segment back you
should it's like a bunch of depressing
shit with no we should we should have
plenty of stories these days for that
segment every that's why it's too real
we can do a full we can do a full oh joy
episode where it's just you know and
like we should do an ODI where we just
drink twice as much as usually as usual
and then every episodes to every every
article is incredibly depressing super
debauchery
alright the fraud debauchery versus
depression moving on to physics
thank you for the beer yes indeed
physics physics makes us all its bitches
physics and the governing body of
weights and measures which is known as
the General Conference on weights and
measures or the cgpm is gonna be
changing four basic units of
measurements in the metric system
what yeah why because just to fuck with
people just just so people commit your
customs already better than our system
yeah well the metrics is fine change it
is I try to use it because it makes it's
a very sensible system it's easy that's
like like anyone who's business metric
to speak it's just easy yeah easy
yeah remember and every five by ten but
they are gonna be doing some updates to
for specific no units terrible idea the
kilogram the ampere the mole and the
Kelvin indeed that's right okay so Kyle
I'm gonna I'm gonna quiz you on what
each of these is amperes amps you can
define the ampere
it's a electricity yes how much I
believe electricity measures how much
electric flow or current is going
through a a medium that's not that's not
too far I know that's a half complete
definition it's like you got a Coulomb
which is instantaneous and Peter
actually has has time in it there oh
that's right unit of electrical
deterrent per second or millisecond one
Coulomb per second so ampere okay cool
um that's a whole other it's a whole
other definition equity room is like
it's like a Joule it's like we we we
like to know some watts and everything
like that and then there's a whole other
it's like it's like you add time or not
had time and the terminal right changes
and there's there's terminology that's
more popular versus the other ones that
seem like more old-school and archaic
but they're still there and everything
sure anyway though I never say Coulomb
and like the spec sheet so yes that's
why I don't kilogram kilogram is the
slightly more interesting one and a
kilogram is these are all SI units which
is standard scientific yes si yes
meeting at your own game yeah I knew
what that meant at some point I don't
know but the kilogram is actually based
on the weight of a specific thing oh
look the verge has a picture of it which
is that thing right so dare you bring
the version of this ship I know sorry
that's a cylinder which is made of
platinum iridium alloy that is housed
specifically at a bell jar in France and
they do occasionally remove it too
way it's and get specific measures
against things but it's gonna be updated
and the cgpm which has sixty member
nations will be voting to change the
system to one that will be defined
indirectly rather than basing it on this
cylindrical hunk of metal there they
will now base it on the planck constant
no that will base it on a tool a tool
that's used to provide the new base unit
which is the kibble balance which sounds
like you're way hip dog food yeah dog
for kibble balance it sounds like a much
more but despite the name and the kibble
balance is a very complex piece of
equipment equipment the first measures
the amount of electricity the electric
current necessary to create an
electromagnetic force that is equal to a
force acting on a given mass it is
during the second stage of this
measurement period that the Planck
constant come comes into play and the
Planck constant as we all know is is a
constant in quantum physics duh now let
me give you guys a brief explanation of
exactly what that means at least I'll be
brief I blacked out for a second there I
forgot what we were talking about it
sorry I don't locked out electricity
reference do what you did there pong
always on point me even when you don't
know the answer use me Oh at some point
okay the point being there using the
Planck constants in order to establish a
kilogram a kilogram is so prime the
kilogram is something that can be a
kilogram or more specifically defined
they want to get they want to get more
specific and this is so that they can
develop tools that can measure these
values more accurately and that will
allow a class of scientists that I was
not aware existed called the metrologist
s-- which is probably really
anal-retentive people they're like I'm
sorry you are a nano
and like a mic your micrometers short of
that measurement they um no I'm sure
metrologist sir they're very nice people
and and it's important to have accurate
accurate measurements of things as well
my brain hurts more to the point though
for anyone who's sitting here thinking
like oh my gosh like I use the metric
system like what is this all gonna
change
oh the two other things by the way here
the kilogram also the mole and the
Kelvin mole is an animal that is one of
the mole has multiple definitions cal
this mole I am NOT gonna go into the
mole because it's a measure I used to
know it more once it's it's it's a
measurement of a substance which makes
me think it's like that should be what
drug dealers used well kilograms kilos
which is that's the point being though
the ampere kilogram mole and Kelvin get
to be changed but the metrologist Tsar
involved in this they have acknowledged
that most people will neither understand
the changes that have taken place and
nor noticed that the change has occurred
so all of this is wait who doesn't
notice that the Train the change has
occurred the metrologist s-- reference
in the article are saying that most
people won't even realize don't
understand the changes France the you
know unless you have a good grasp of
quantum physics sure all right so it
doesn't apply to them or or notice that
the changes have occurred so again these
are being changed but they're being
changed very very small ways people whom
it's like yeah or smart enough will
realize that there's been a change that
Lee and unfortunately article does not
go into further detail as far as to how
they re free quantifying the ampere and
and and or the mole or the Kelvin Kelvin
is a unit of temperature but what so
well the names won't actually change
it's just what they're actually
representing yeah they're not changing
the names they're changing the values
feel like an inch for example it's based
on like some King in England and he was
like my finger should be the basis of
measurement and it's like you can't go
to that king and measure his finger and
be like that's an inch and now we know
the exact what is it yeah so yeah it's
it's just about like we it's about
scientists quantifying the world and
using values that can be used
interchangeably so that people in
different areas can still measure things
accurately and compare them to each
other which is very useful for
scientific study those values need to be
updated to see every now and then and
all that good stuff make sense I'm on
board yes and of course now you are all
familiar with this stuff other
interesting point the article brought up
was that this has been done before
pointed out that in 1983 the speed of
light
they changed the speed of light but they
didn't I guess they didn't change the
speed of light they updated the
definition of the speed of light which
is now defined as two hundred ninety
nine thousand seven hundred ninety-two
sorry 299,792,458 meters per second
that's fast that is the speed of light
which is very fast and if you're
interesting I'm sure it's gonna be
riveting the the governing body cgpm
we'll be live-streaming this and they
okay you have this vote on making these
changes okay so it's still up to about
you all right one more story here all
right this is a plug in plate PC classic
console we have shown several retro
consoles here like the little mini
PlayStation and this is the classic PC
right cuz we've got we've got all that
other stuff
who's that guy for the consoles let's
make a PC I don't know he looks like an
assassin's Creed care I did not pre
watch this video he wearing a robe but
there it is as you can see it looks like
it's been carved out of asbestos or
something like that it's got the classic
beige
I like his his hoodie that he's got a
yeah it's got some where did those
ethnic vibes go no that's the Pancho
Pancho
yeah it's a classic poncho so here is
him playing a classic PC game on the
classic PC console that was doomed
wait let's jump back in a classic poncho
it stays doom okay yeah he's playing
with a gamepad there get a frame counter
up in the corner or something word so I
don't 44 hurts oh gee doom everyone
should potentially invest in this is
this like a Kickstarter or something no
okay I don't I don't think so it's just
it's just ready for sale it's finished
product ready to go is it all ready for
sailors from units II Oh a menu system
it will come pre-loaded with at least 30
games from the DOS era at the 80s and
90s
you can also potentially purchase more
later there's a mailing list where you
can see the final game lineup once it's
nailed down I was looking for a list of
games that they're planning to have
which oh here we go
Oh song licenses
150 song licenses well it come another
color colors chain-smoker beige doesn't
compliment my furniture
yes heretic we will also offer at least
one of the color in a more modern
palette maybe black nice super modern
things more modern than black okay so
you have to sign up for the mailing list
to see the game list when it's available
ah I would assume that at least original
Dumas we can really confirm at this
point is that original doom so you guys
are now aware of this oh oh yeah one
thing I should point out this plug and
play classic PC console if you own a PC
of any kind you can play all these games
on it already you don't need this thing
yeah this is very true it's not even
like like like Nintendo or PlayStation
where it's like well you need an
emulator and you gotta eat the roms and
there's some right like legal these are
dubiousness they or whatever like these
are PC games PC games
anyone can play them on a PC but just
not on that such a small I'll be very
tiny and and yeah it's got its palm your
hand right there yeah that's got like IO
it's got RCA out standard ICS and it's
got an HDMI so it's like an extension of
your PC yeah you want to just take a
little piece of your rig we have you
kind of curious what a little board they
actually have installed in there that
it's running off of but anyway yeah
you're an hour of that thing
sweet let's move on to our sponsor spot
this week's episode of awesome hardware
is brought to you by Toshiba Toshi's
right
Toshiba Toshiba hey we're specifically
talking about products that Toshiba
makes which are based on their BICS NAND
flash memory yeah which is able to make
and integrated products which are fast
solid-state storage yep using BICS flash
and also not crazy expensive so this is
the TR 200 SSD you will often find this
among the best price per gigabyte
options if you're looking at SSDs that
are available like
2.5 inch SATA drives 240 gig in the 480
gig varieties of that available you'll
find some links in this video's
description if you guys want to check
these products out and if you're looking
for some nvme I'm about two drives that
won't break the bank
they've got the RC 100 right here at
which I have apparently used in a build
already because I don't have these it is
so small it's not cute you can't even
see it now that's not true cause that's
tiny
definitely not sure I actually used it
in the build which demonstrates how much
faith I have in its reliability and
performance especially for its price so
Kyle's trust that RC 100 that the RFC
100 from Toshiba so much that he has
integrated in into a build I have how
did it was it was it was it so far I'll
Jing to install so far it installed very
well I installed windows onto it and it
booted without without question it took
the Windows OS like a champ nice and
agent it just booted like who'd like
like you've never seen anything booted
like it like a Buddha from Budapest we
did like Buddha booted you can kombucha
alright so guys again links to Toshiba
products down in the description they
also have an external SSD as well yes
we're also promoting so thanks to them
for sponsoring awesome hardware to know
where you can it's not there you know
although I got to change this QT now
we're doing and we're doing we're doing
sword fight we're gonna surf a course
we're doing sorry whoo I'm sore fighting
well sword I only have one question
though I meant I meant to do two
questions and I didn't so there we go so
fight the long-running
segments we do on the show where Cal and
I argue about stuff yay classic today we
are going to do a follow up on
that thing we were talking about about
the scientific units of measurements
being recalibrated and what other basic
units of measurements do you think need
recalibration we got the millimeter of
course way too small we got the decibel
always confusing the second of course
sometimes takes forever sometimes to
just stream by too quick very fast rate
we got the shit-ton of course the
venerable needs to be made more accurate
Candela always pisses me off and
megahertz cow what you think scoop let's
keep these yeah let's keep these brief
sure I don't do they warned that much
zero
how much analysis anyway yeah um I'm
gonna have to say people want to know
people want to know the answer to this
question effect I think a shit-ton
shit-ton needs to be redefined because
you know it does not it should literally
mean a ton of shit when you say that's a
shit ton it should be equivalent to a
ton of a pile of shit that makes sense
to me
even though it wouldn't really matter
what it's a ton of because it's still a
ton people say wow there's a shit ton of
beer in this cup no that's that's not a
ton at all regardless of the the prefix
you attach to it I think that we're
misrepresenting that that unit of
measurement and we have been for such a
long time especially since it's so
commonly used in in today's slang
vernacular so I rest my case
reasonable Kyle you make some strong
points there you support your argument
well still wrong though because I think
the unit of measurement that needs the
most recalibration right now is gonna be
the second second obviously the one of
the more finite
measurements of time and dictates our
every our every movement like you know
you just every second that passes
that's another second it's constant it's
not ending I just wanted to frigate stop
so we need to do we need to figure
something out but I won't stop call deal
with the second it won't ever stop the
other thing I'm trying the other thing
I've never really
I've been able to figure out myself what
I wear is the first like what what do
you this we have a second like a second
just went by but what happened before
that I don't that have been the first
dachshund we have all these seconds and
no firsts no thirds either that pisses
me off
pisses me off because you know what was
important is winning being first
yeah with so many seconds nobody's first
but like they say it makes perfect first
worst second best
so maybe who says that nobody I've never
heard anyone say really really that's
why I learned that in school from all
the first or second best seven year olds
yeah first first first worst like when
someone would line up in first like and
first and everyone everyone behind would
say first worst second best and then
third was the nerd and fourth nobody was
it okay and I see now you struck up like
nostalgic I'll come back there it was
the nerd did that all come rushing back
and hit me like a truck my childhood / -
there's truth there's truth in that we
were clearly third I don't know I have
no idea they were arguing with people
getting medicine we need to answer this
question right now there it could have
been the two results are thank you guys
all for putting tile wins with the
shit-ton hey Wow let's have us way too
much this is weird because we just got a
new votes oh wait I get to refresh this
we got to update we got it votes coming
right now compelling argument votes
still being counted it's like that no
I'm not gonna talk about that shit son
obviously the obviously though people
are wanting a more precise definition of
that which I I completely agree with
yeah yeah decibel though also I'm a
problem logarithmic scale just just not
something that's immediately easy to
grasp people seem to be most happy with
the millimeter those so um millimeter
here to stay keep doing what you do
alright guys that wraps up my half of
the show such as it is thank
how much for watching again we're doing
our hands a little bit on the shorter
side we've never met any that's thanks
for watching this said 1/2 checkout
Kyle's half if you're watching on
YouTube it's linked to the video's
description the thumbs up button on the
way out if you do big thank you to
whoever is gonna do time stamps for me
later on I love when you guys do that
thanks for that ol bear back ok here be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
