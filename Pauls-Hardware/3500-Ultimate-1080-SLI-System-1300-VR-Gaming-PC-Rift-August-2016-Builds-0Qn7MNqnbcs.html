monthly builds video for August 2016
every month I create a couple computer
build parts lists based on your votes
and feedback from the previous month and
then I'm actually building one of them
every month as well so here's a look
back through history and my saved parts
list in the past on PC part picker of
course at three technically two but kind
of three builds for this month as well
and last month I asked what PC villas
you guys want to see in August and you
all voted very it was very contentious
there was lots of clothes voting here
but twenty percent one with the 1200
Allah all-rounder however last month I
built a twelve hundred dollar system
that I felt actually fit perfectly into
this category so for that reason i
vetoed this one and i went with the
twenty-six percent option cheapest vr
ready system plus headset so we got both
of those you guys one of up for next
month link is down in the description
what PC bills you want to see in
September and your options are right
there that's well hundred-dollar bill as
well if you guys want to check it out
links or also in the description you can
watch me actually assemble the dang
thing turned out really really nice i
was super happy with the final finished
product super clean and then i actually
went through the trouble of testing it
and benchmarking it too so I check out
both of those videos because I think you
will find there just jam-packed with
information and they're super useful
moving on to this month's bills Oh for
Argus 2016 so here's the thirteen
hundred dollar v r build + oculus rift
and I wanted to do a full build because
when I've done builds before and I've
said this bill does v already and people
said that's not VR ready because you
don't include the VR headset
head-mounted display just a significant
amount of the cost to be fair so six
hundred dollars is what you'll pay for
an oculus rift and that is the cheapest
viable full VR ready capable headset
meant to go with a gaming PC so that is
what I've included beyond that you have
essentially the rest of the price which
came in at just shy of thirteen hundred
dollars so you have about seven hundred
dollars worth of computer going along
with that oculus rift headset which is I
just sort of manually put that in there
since pc part picker actually doesn't
have it listed anyway so for the cpu
which is probably to be the most
controversial choice i went with an i5
6500 now they're off obviously other
viable options for CPUs that are oculus
rift ready but I wanted a quad-core and
I like skylake because it's new and it's
got the best instructions per clock
performance and all that kind of stuff
turbo will go up to 3.6 gigahertz the
6400 is also a full quad-core CPU from
Intel that could also slot into this
it's about 20 bucks cheaper but it has a
lower base clock or lower boost base and
turbo frequency so you're not going to
be able to get quite as much performance
out of it especially if you're doing the
BC okay overclocking okay motherboard is
this one right here it's a gigabyte h17
tmds 3h only about 80 bucks you can get
it as cheap as 70 depending on where you
look for it and it's got pretty much
like everything you would need for a
motherboard i want micro ATX to keep the
size down a little bit so you'd have a
little bit of expansion of course your
slot for your graphics card right there
it's even got an m2 built in there as
well for I oh you've got your display
outs which you're probably going to use
because you'll be using your discrete
GPU ones and everything else you need
some USB 3 all that good stuff no USB
type-c on here that's the only real
downside but you do have two USB 3.0
front panel ports which you're really
gonna really be able to use the case I
chose but who cares anyway for a storage
device we went with a simple SSD 240
gigs is enough for your operating system
and some games if you want more storage
find an old one terabyte hard drive or
something and drop it in there as well
sixty bucks for 240 gigs is kind of the
going rate for a bargain on an SSD right
now and it's it's not the fastest SSD in
the world it's a team SSD but if you
look at a SATA SSD and the reads and
writes are up there in the 500 megabytes
per second range and your I ops are
around seventy to a hundred thousand
you're going to be getting most of the
performance and going beyond that you're
not going to get a whole lot memory
trace hears from g.skill actually had
some team memory in here but it
disappeared as of this morning as I was
trying to set this all up but anyway 34
bucks for an eight gig kid of memory
2400 speed who cares if it matches
there's no side panel on the case for
the graphics card I went with a one that
I was hoping you could actually find
this was in stock yesterday it is not in
stock anymore finding an RX variety
that's in stock is difficult my
apologies and also this is a reference
design if you're going to get an F for
80 and you're going to try to keep your
eyes out and find one that's in stock i
would definitely recommend going with an
aftermarket design rather than the
reference design that i have listed here
again i was just trying to go for one
that's in stock and also around the
actual price so 240 to 250 is kind of
what you'd pay the higher end more
expensive for 80s kinda
get you up into the GTX 1060 range and
then it becomes more of a question
whether you're getting the most bang for
your buck but the RX variety has proven
itself to be very capable when it comes
to VR performance and it's got eight
gigs of memory and it's a good GPU I
like any way for our case we have a
fractal design core 1100 it's $30 case
its micro ATX and it's got a USB three
front panel connector what more do you
want I guess maybe HDMI on the front for
a VR build could be kind of useful I
don't know other than that though you
know is this really kind of a no-frills
case from fractal but you know again it
kind of gets the job done micro-atx got
enough space in here for some storage
drives your power supply of course goes
up the top you know that's it's a case
30 bucks for power spy finally went with
EVGA 500 this is the 500 be it's 80 plus
bronze again a kind of no frills power
supply but it is 80 plus bronze rated so
the decent performance it's not going to
have super fancy looking all black
cables or anything you do have ketchup
and mustard but again it's going to get
the job done and when we're looking for
the cheapest system we can build its be
already this is going to be a solid
power supply for you and look if you
count the rebates you can get it for as
cheap as like 28 bucks right now so that
is a very good deal in my opinion and
this whole system comes in at just shy
of thirteen hundred dollars and that is
including six hundred dollars of the
price for the oculus rift which you know
that'll get you off off the ground up
and running and you know 1,300 bucks
total for all that including the headset
i think is a pretty good deal especially
when you consider you know comparing
just compared to a tight necks which
costs 1200 bucks by itself for the
second build i went to kind of
over-the-top i wanted to do a two-way
gtx 1080 builds i'm also kind of
considering that i'm going to build one
of these systems later in the month and
i wanted to do something that was
feasible if possible so this is actually
kind of an asus and corsair build and I
leaned towards asus and Corsair
components partially because Corsair
might end up sponsoring the build if I
do it later in the month although that
is still TBD so believe that to your
we'll figure that out later anyway total
price here is actually 35 4289 as of the
filming of this and you'll notice we
have really high end parts so I figured
this was going in like groups of six
hundred
six hundred dollars for the CPU six
hundred dollars for like the memory and
the motherboard 600 bucks each for your
graphics cards six nine bucks for
storage i guess but that is 11 terabytes
of storage so what i did was i did this
whole build with the corsair and a sous
parts and then i redid it which i'll
come back to enjoy once i go over all
these and i shaved like five or six
hundred bucks off the price 6850 k is a
six core processor from Intel Broadwell
II and if you want a really really fast
processor you kind of have to go this
route although it is very expensive so
606 dollars is what these are selling
for right now you can get a six core
Broadwell ecp you for less money than
this by going with the 6800 k that is
down around four hundred dollars however
that one has 40 PCIe I'm sorry that one
has 28 PCIe lines whereas this one has
40 PCIe lanes the choice is yours
whether you think that's a valid or not
I actually went with the 58 20k with the
second version of this bill but 6850 k
gets you six core 3.6 gigahertz turbo it
is unlocked for overclocking and all
that good stuff so a very very powerful
processor whether or not it's worth the
price is of course up to your discretion
want to keep that nice and cool so we
have the corsair hydro series h100i v 2
240 millimeter cpu cooler i also want
the black and white color scheme for
this build i don't think i mentioned
that yet this one has some little plates
you can swap in to make the colors match
and everything and all in all very very
nice cooler they've done some upgrades
from that for the compared to the v1
version for the motherboard i want the
asus x 99 deluxe to this is a really
nice motherboard and actually just
finished shooting a review on it it
comes with an insane amount of
accessories so even though you're
looking at a pretty expensive
motherboard which costs over four
hundred dollars for twenty dollars at
newegg right now you get some pretty
compelling ad on options like a
thunderbolt three card they drop in
there you get the fan splitter option as
well you denim to riser card a bunch of
other little random accessories and
stuff in there too so i thought it made
a little bit more compelling deal it's
also got RGB leds that actually look
pretty cool when they're lit up and
stuff i did a demo that that video
should be up in just a couple days stay
tuned for that anyway very nice
motherboard might again be more
expensive than what some people want to
spend but
think it'll look pretty cool corsair
vengeance LED series memory is what I
chose for this one 32 gig kit four by
eight gig this is 2666 speed and I went
with this again because okay it was kind
of sticking with the Corsair and Asus
theme these are also new as of computex
this year and they finally have actually
launched I chose the version with the
white LEDs across the top so the tops of
these sticks have LEDs that look pretty
stinking cool of course there's even
working on software to make them dance
for you and everything so yeah that's
why with those still more expensive than
what you could get so but i'll come back
to that SSD have a 960 gig se23 neutron
XD i corsair doesn't have a huge range
of options when it comes to SSDs in the
2.5 inch range but they do have some
very solid options and the neutron
series is very good when it comes to
right consistency this one's 350 bucks
though I believe in the actual parts
list it's less than that ya know 350 at
newegg apparently that's the cheapest
cheapest price you can get to get for
that but still very fast SSD 960 gigs
and again there are better Christ
performance options welcome back to in
just a sec toshiba five terabytes 7200
RPM a storage tribe these are 3.5 inch
mechanical drives I just wanted to throw
in a bunch of storage since this is a
high-end build I was actually looking
for a single 8 terabyte drive and I
decided to go with 25 terabyte drives
because these that single a terabyte
drives around three hundred dollar price
range two of these you can pair up and
raid if you want to or give yourself
some redundancy and easiest Peter
redundancy for raid 0 or raid raid 1 and
you'll get 10 terabytes of storage or
five usable terabytes if you go for raid
0 I would go raid I go raid 1 this
option just keep yourself some backup
okay for our graphics card i have 2 dt x
1080 s since it was an asus motherboard
i just decided well let's stick with an
asus graphics card and what was the rog
Strix version however these are again
really hard to find just like the 480 so
it's out of stock here this is at least
a reasonable price six hundred dollars
really is the MSRP of the GTX 1080 than
630 i think is a very reasonable price
to pay for a upgraded version with asus
strix cooler on it and RGB leds and all
that stuff and again this was something
that was
stock yesterday but for ten 80s you just
really have to keep an eye out if I
actually do this build I'm not sure if I
going to be able to get a hold of two of
these but I will at least be able to do
to standard founders edition 1080s for
that I know I can obtain but who knows
maybe i'll get the asus strix cards
actually might be checking out an asus
strix gtx 970 fairly soon but that still
remains to be seen okay moving on to the
case corsair carbide series air 540 I
was considering the 780 t as well this
one's a little bit cheaper still full
ATX I think it's a nice little boxy
system you get a bit wider footprint
with the box style design but you can
still of course fit everything in there
and of course it will fit our cooler and
since it's a corsair case we know it's
got good build quality and I like how
these looks keeping the power supply on
the opposite side and everything I think
it turns out really nice especially with
a couple graphics cards in there for the
power supply we have a corsair HX I
series 1000 Watts 80 plus platinum so a
thousand watts I think is a good you can
get away with it like 850 even or less
with 210 80s but thousand watts i think
is a good round number 80 plus platinum
is a almost the highest level of
efficiency you can get 200 bucks for
this although you can get a rebate right
now so you're going to be able to like
connect this up with the your other
corsair stuff and use corsair monitoring
with course your link which is kind of
cool but again if you don't want to
spend that much you can get this build
for a lot cheaper but we are shaving
some pieces off anyway so just to
compare these two builds this is a 58
20k still with 1080 SLI this comes in so
set 2850 earlier today and it's extra
dropped even less 2814 again that's
compared to our original build here with
similar product but similar specs 3540
289 is what I'm currently seeing for
that one now what did we change their
here first off of course most obviously
is going to be the processor we shaved
two hundred and forty dollars or so off
the cost of the processor by going with
a knife I 758 20k so this is the last
gen haswell-e processor that's not quite
as fast but it still has six cores it
still has 28 pcie lanes so it's still
going to be just fine for your 2-way sli
support you might have a little bit
more limitation when it comes to extra
connectivity on the motherboard with
something like this because if you got
two way sli its using up probably eight
by eight of pcie lanes and you have
whatever's left over for your u dot two
and your m dot to another storage and a
USB 3.1 and that kind of thing so you
are saving us some of your performance
but as long as you're not maxing out
your eye oh you're still going to get
most of the performance with a 58 20k
when with an air cooler for 40 bucks
rather than the liquid cooler for over a
hundred dollars this is an enter Maxie
TST 40 it's black so it'll match and
everything with an still an asus
motherboard still very solid asus
motherboard the x 99 a 2 here instead of
the deluxe this one again you know it's
got everything you need it's not quite
as high end and it doesn't have quite
all the bells and whistles as the deluxe
but still it's going to get the job done
and anyone who gets it i'm sure will be
totally happy wait i lost my list when
with an 8am premier 960 gigs so this is
a full over a hundred and this is like a
hundred and forty dollars cheaper for
this adata 960 gig SSD compared to the
the corsair late i skipped the memory
here's the a day to premiere look I
don't even have a picture of it surely
newegg will have a picture of it there a
native premiere SP 550 seems to be
really hitting the price to the bang for
your buck dollar amount amounts when it
comes to SSDs but yeah just a lot
cheaper not going to be quite as fast as
the xti of course for the memory i just
went with about a 30 ish dollar cheaper
kit from crucial ballistix this is a
very simple kit but it's still going to
match with the color scheme and then
finally for the power supply went with
an EVGA thousand-watt 80 plus gold
instead of 80 plus platinum and you
still get again the same amount of
wattage a little bit less efficiency
your power bill is going to be slightly
more but saves about forty to sixty
dollars like 120 I guess that's
including a mail-in rebate so it saves
60 70 80 bucks depending on whether or
not you include that mail in rebate and
those are all of my bills for the month
of August up you guys have enjoyed if
you did hit the thumbs up button leaving
comments in the comments section let me
know if you like this video or what you
do differently or your build that you
picked out the way better than the
builds that I picked out and I'm going
to do one more straw poll down there
where you guys
can vote on which of these systems you
think I should assemble later this month
it's going to be in a couple weeks today
I'm going on a trip in a few days here
and I will be telling you more about
that as I'm on the trip but in the
meantime let me know what you think
thank you so much for watching and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
