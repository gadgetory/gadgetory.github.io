hardware this is my monthly builds video
for May 2016 every month I do a couple
builds these are theoretical parts lists
so I'm not actually assembling anything
today so for any of you guys who are
looking for actual builds I highly
encourage you to check out my builds
playlist over on my youtube channel so
just check that out I'll put a link to
this in the description there you can
actually watch me assemble things what
this video is all about is helping you
guys especially if you're new time new
to computer building just figure out
what parts you should actually use
because sometimes choosing the parts
making sure that all compatible is a
challenge so I'm there is some some
actual interaction with you guys in this
video series so I do ask for your
feedback and you all provide that for me
the straw polls so last month in those
last month April yes and April I asked
you what PC builds you wanted to see for
the May 2016 video and while it was
actually quite a shoot out here when it
comes to the voting the NASS build one
right here with 28% of the votes so I'm
gonna be doing an ass build today and
then I'm also gonna be doing a gtx 1080
based build GTA x 1080 was just launched
by nvidia or at least paper launched and
let me post this additional straw hole
to those of you watching in chat welcome
and thanks for being here everyone
watching live right now as well this is
my question for next month and it's kind
of a more vague question than i usually
ask them a monthly builds video because
i might not actually do a monthly builds
video next month at the beginning of
june i'm gonna be in taiwan for Computex
which is always a very exciting events
but it means i may or may not actually
be able to do build so for that reason
i've left it kind of vague but what
hardware you guys most excited about of
course we have invidious new GPUs 1080
and 1070 those were just again paper
launched and they're available and May
27th for the 1080 Intel's new enthusiast
CPUs no to notice the next three I'll
have asterisk next to them
these are rumored so I can't confirm or
deny their exact xual existence but into
Intel supposed to have some enthusiast
CPUs coming out and be supposed to have
new Radeon GPUs based on the Polaris
codenamed
view architecture and AMD also has new
CPUs and ap use on the horizon as well
those are probably less likely to be
available by next month as far as what
I've heard but you guys all please go
vote on that and when I come back and do
this in June or probably more likely
July
I will base my builds on that so I'm
gonna save the Nass build and I'll do
that second I'm gonna jump right into
the GTX 1080 launch build so GTX 1080 is
in videos new GPU it is currently the
flagship in the ten hundred series if
that's what they're calling it
and at launch it's got some really
impressive like frequencies right out of
the bat the Embargo hasn't lifted four
full reviews of this card yet so there's
still some independent testing to be
done but everything Nvidia has told us
about is very impressive so far the card
has an MSRP of $600 or the founders
Edition costs $700 now what's been
revealed about the founders Edition in
the past few days is that the founders
Edition is essentially what is Nvidia's
reference design but they're creating
the reference design and making it more
of a premium product I guess for people
so they're charging a little bit more
for the for the founders Edition it does
have a really cool cooler on and
everything I mean they've redesigned it
and all that kind of stuff so take it or
leave it but basically what I'm here to
tell you guys is that this founders
edition card is probably going to be the
only thing available come May 27th we're
not sure there are board partners who
might also have cards available but that
means that if you're gonna get a GTX
1080 on launch day you're probably gonna
be spending 700 bucks
versus 600 bucks so you might be able to
get if you wait a little bit of time in
order to get the the non-reference
Edition I guess the non founders Edition
so all that being said let's talk about
the rest of the the products in this
actual build so $1,800 is the total
price of this I felt these products were
all sort of in line with what you would
want to get if you're getting a 1080
granted you can shave a hundred to three
hundred bucks off of the total cost of
this build by shaving you know cutting
corners different places so for instance
and
6,700 k you could go with the 6600 k if
you wanted I have a pretty nice
motherboard I mean it's not super
expensive and Maximus eight Ranger but
you could get you know a you can shave
3040 bucks off the cost of a motherboard
there's ways you could go about this I
also did some pretty decent storage
options with a one terabyte SSD and a
two terabyte hard drive which also are
both kind of optional you know you could
upgrade but anyway of course the 6700 K
right off the bat happy to say the 6700
K prices have dropped thank god they're
down in the 350 dollar range if you're
buying in the u.s. at least all these
prices are in the US Dollars and all
these links to the stuff is gonna be
down in the video description on youtube
if you guys take a look here's the CPU
cooler I went with and actually have one
of these in hand right now I haven't
done any testing with it but reviews on
this have been really good this is a
cryo rig and they're kind of a newer
company based out of China
I actually think they're out of Taiwan
and this is a cool little cooler 35
bucks
this little cooler h7 is what it's
called and it's got really good ratings
already you know and it's got you know
it's not quite like the hyper 212 they
they got like a little plate on top to
give it a better cleaner finish and all
that kind of stuff and again for 35
bucks you know I'm not going to complain
you have to buy this at Newegg right now
and it's 35 bucks at nuoc for some
reason that's not updated on PC part
picker but anyway get that at newing for
a motherboard we have an ASUS Maximus 8
Ranger this is an asus rog motherboard
they're not very big pictures of it
right here but there you go
asus rog it's mostly black with some red
accents it's got excellent power
delivery let's look on it let's look at
it over a new egg it's assuming the new
egg website loads come on new egg
supposed to be fast supposed to be fast
new egg okay
alright there's kind of a better look at
it but you can see you know it's kind of
it's decently kitted out for a mid 150
hundred and seventy dollar motherboard
and again rog series so you know you got
all kinds of good stuff you got i'm
about to support everything you'd really
want for for a LGA 1151 motherboard for
memory I kept things simple with the
Corsair 16 gig kit to buy eight gigs
I feel like 16 gigs is what you want to
go with again here you could shave a few
dollars off the cops by going with like
eight gigs total but I like this
vengeance series of memory because
they're they don't stand out a lot
they're low-profile they're black they
blend in I feel like memory should
either you know do its job and and and
not be noticed much for be super blingy
like you know the avexir stuff that has
you know LEDs or plasma rays coming at
the top of it or whatever anyway moving
on to storage I decided let's why not go
with the one terabyte SSD those are
becoming much more affordable these days
so SanDisk Ultra 2 is a great option you
can get one for a little over 200 bucks
again this is somewhere where you could
really shave a lot of money off of the
total cost of this build because I spent
around 200 and there's $78 on storage I
also included a Hitachi Deathstar 2
terabytes internal hard drive hitachi
drives do a great job you can get this
at Amazon 54 bucks again lots of
different options for your storage
configuration here but um you know go
with what works for you save some money
if you wants or hey one terabyte SSD is
it's pretty impressive the GPU of course
as already mentioned is going to be this
good old GT X 1080 from from Nvidia and
I can't say too much more about this
because again there's more stuff that I
can't even really talk about yet but
these performance numbers from Nvidia
are pretty impressive and to be taken
with a grain of salt
next up we have the case which is the
NZXT h4 40 and I went with this because
it's white it's gonna kind of stand out
give a give a contrast to the the stuff
that you have inside there you know well
designed case by NZXT and you know of
course go with the black version if you
want if you like black you can you can
do black and red here pretty simply I
thought this would have a nice look
though and also since the the GTX 1080
is still kind of that silver with the
green on it's hard to coordinate
everything with that unless
you go with like a black and green build
but anyway finally for power supply I
went with a bit more wattage on the
power supply still stick him with the
EVGA supernova next 750 went for this
one because it's it works out of the box
80 plus gold all the cabling is all
black so you're not gonna deal with any
ketchup and mustard BS and it's fully
modular and you know these I can't stop
recommending these cuz $70 for this is a
really good price this is with a mail-in
rebate of course but just 70 bucks I
can't recommend any other power supply
as well these exist at the prices that
they are I'm sorry sorry but I can't and
that pretty much rounds it out so um
yeah again guys $1,800 is kind of what I
would recommend for getting on board
with this and also the reason I went
with that stronger power supply 750
watts you could probably get away with
550 or 600 is I really think that with
the hundred and eighty watt design power
of the GTX 1080
but you could probably do a two way set
up with this don't quote me on that but
I think it's very very very possible
yeah that's it for build one let's move
on to the second build which again based
on your votes and your feedback was a
Nass build so I built an ass counter
recently actually I'm building another
system right now I meant to mention this
at the beginning see this right here do
that that's the system I'm building
right now once I finish this I'm gonna
go and finish building this this is a
this is a silverstone power supply with
the custom sleeved cables buy-in sourced
customs i was smart and didn't do it
myself this time i horse did i to
insourced that's weird okay back to my
point though which is that here is a
maximum storage minimum wattage nass
build now i recently built the NASS I
used some leftover parts some parts that
I already had lying around to kind of
assemble the thing and I think that's a
very popular thing to do for an S this
is the NASS that I would built if I was
building it from the ground up with new
parts so anyone who's thinking about
building an S I would really strongly
consider looking at what you have on
hand first already like I mean if you
have an old Sandy Bridge system or
something like
that's a great option to take that and
repurpose it for an S if you're using
free Ness and you're using ZFS you
definitely want to have lots of memory
and you also want to have ECC memory if
possible and that was one thing that I
didn't have for my FreeNAS build was ECC
memory and as a result I'm considering
you rebuilding it once again I'll see if
that actually happens but if you're
building a new nest here's some options
I think you should consider first off we
have this as Rock Mini ITX it's an atom
based motherboard so it's got the
motherboard as well as an atom processor
built into it
which is pretty cool so that's why it
costs a little bit more but remember
you're getting the motherboard and the
processor there I got 16 gigs of ECC
memory I got some WD red hard drives
I got a silverstone Nass case which has
external bays that you can remove which
is very convenient and have a corsair
power supply which is way overkill but
i'll come back to the reason why I chose
that power supply in just a moment first
off this motherboard let's look at it on
Newegg because they usually have good
pictures assuming it loads alright so
this is a C 550d 4i Mini ITX server
motherboard and look look how fancy it
is I kind of like this why do I like
this well it's it's got passive cooling
for one thing it's got an atom processor
they don't get too hot but it can get
the job done there's a upgraded version
of this motherboard as well that has an
additional 4 cores on the Atom processor
you might also consider it but it costs
a good 100 250 dollars more so I decided
to go with this one it's also got lots
of SATA so you'll notice it's I've read
the specs and it listed like tenth SATA
ports but I'm seeing I'm seeing 12 on
here I don't know what the deal is with
that but you know it's got lots of SATA
ports let's just say you're building an
ass you want lots of connectivity
I'll set for RAM slots so even though
I'm using a 2 by 8 gig kit of ECC memory
for 16 gigs I could easily drop in more
and upgrade that in the future so that's
pretty nice as well this was originally
recommended by Wendell heated a Bilitis
a while back it's not necessarily brand
new but I think it's a great option and
it's something I might actually invest
in for mine ass because keeping those
you know if you're building an ass for
24/7 use keeping the power draw at a
minimum especially when it comes to the
CPUs is gonna be pretty useful for you
alright
moving back over to the memory again
this is just a really basic crucial
server memory look it's it's it is and
it's green but it doesn't matter because
DCC err correcting it's got an extra
it's got an extra little DRAM chip on
there that it uses for parity and the
only real drawback of ECC memory is it
is I don't know almost twice as much as
non-ecc memory also heroes snoring right
now sorry about that
hero well you go it's loud ok for
storage if you're building an S I highly
highly recommends getting yourself not
consumer-grade hard drives like if you
look at the WD lineup for example they
do a color base so it's really easy to
talk about WD green drives and WD blue
drives are not rated for enterprise use
or for use in Nats bays or that kind of
thing so green and blue drives I don't
recommend though they're only used for
like eight eight ish hours of a day use
Mac's what you want is a WD red drive
those are made specifically for NASA's
or WD black drives or WD Enterprise
drives are also they have the same kind
of special technology going on in there
it's made so that when there's
vibrations from other drives that are
next to it it can handle that better
without having read/write errors or that
kind of thing anyway WD red drives I've
been a big fan of they're actually
recommended by FreeNAS I have four of
them I put three of them in this build
oops I'm on the wrong page I put three
of them it's in this build so you that
is about $450 worth of drives I think
this would be a great start out the
solution for somebody because you could
have a parity drive give yourselves 8
terabytes of storage and you'd have one
drive could fail and you'd still be ok
but again since a lot of NASA's are
built with kind of older hardware that
kind of thing you don't you you don't
necessarily need to buy any drives if
you already have drives that you can use
but again I really recommend going with
drives that are built for NASA use or
enterprise use or 24/7 usage two more
things for this one is this case the
silverstone ds3 a DB Mini ITX tower case
now here's another thing that you may or
may not want to go with if you're
considering an S this case for instance
has these drive bays on the front so
made to be an S you can label all these
know which drivers are where you have a
drive that fails that pops up on your
you know your your FreeNAS UI or
whatever you can spot whatever drive it
is pull it out pop another drive in
it'll rebuild and you'll be good to go
whereas if you use a more traditional
style case you might have to dig in
there to pull the drives that might be a
little bit more difficult now the flip
side here is that this uses SFX power
supply so I didn't need to kit it with a
smaller size power supply and the
smaller size power supplies are more
expensive and then I was reading some
reviews on this that said it's a little
bit more of a challenge to build in if
you need to get back into the system
after you've built in it they were you
know they were so so on that but 140
bucks for that and I think the
convenience of having those external
bays would be convenient moving on to
the power supply again this power supply
is kind of ridiculous for this build but
it's $90 this is Corsairs SF series so
this is the new Corsair series that's
you know sfx and fully modular look nice
cabling you have nice black cabling to
match with your green PCB motherboard or
whatever but I didn't really get this
for the black cabling or anything like
that all I got this for was because it
was sfx
and it was 80 plus gold if you want to
shave another 40 50 bucks off the cost
of this there's 80 plus bronze rated sfx
power supplies that are in the 250 to
350 watt range and if you look at the
total estimated power draw of this
entire system at least according to pc
part picker it's 103 watts so that's not
all that much clearly a 450 watt power
supply is way overkill but if you want
sfx and 80 plus gold those are the
drives that are available there's
nothing less than 450 watts I think one
of those bronze power supplies would
probably be just fine as well but now
you could add a graphics card to your
kness with no you prize should nobody
should do that anyway that is all for
this video guys I hope you have enjoyed
thanks to all you guys who have jumped
into chat and said hello an octane Kitty
and punk poets is here wow there's lots
of people who have jumped in there so
