my monthly builds video for February
2017 this is a video series I do every
month at the beginning of the month I
plan out usually two computer builds
either parts list so I'm not necessarily
putting anything together for today but
I will be talking about the parts going
into the builds giving you some
priceless for them and some locations
where you can purchase them and if
you're interested in actual builds
themselves well I do those two on the
channel and I will be building one of
the system's I talked about today later
in the month
speaking of for January I've actually
got the January build right there and I
haven't done the final follow up video
on that with the testing and everything
that is coming soon I'm still waiting
for the g.skill RGB memory to arrive for
that but that should be here on Monday
or Tuesday so expect that video next
week sometime in the meantime again if
you do want to check out some builds
including that build I just did it was a
$2,800 system although about 700 bucks -
that is one of the SSDs so check that
out the build video came out pretty nice
got some time-lapse and all that good
stuff of course there's fan interaction
for this video as well so I do want to
hear back from you guys so I asked you
last month what you wanted to see for
February and the overwhelming answer was
give us a damn Zen build already which
unfortunately I can't do but I do hear
you guys 42% of you watched that and I
do have more information coming on that
second place winner though was the
entry-level x99 build actually a
follow-up to that one - because I did an
entry-level x9 build back in 2015 but
here's some AMD news just true to teach
you guys a little bit more Lisa sue
their CEO actually talked at a briefing
Skol and she actually said that
Rison will be launching early in march
in early March
so hopefully May it within the first
week or two of March again we're still
not totally sure so for that what PCT
builds you want to see in March and I
have a wide variety of options here
everyone go vote on that it is linked in
the description down below I also ask
the question back in December which is
which under-represented case
manufacturer would you like to see
future build video with because I've
mainly been working with Corsair fractal
and bit I'm sorry I'm not dickin NZXT
for kind of in the last few months of
2015 so fantex was one of the answers
and for that reason I built the fan text
base system last month liam leave a
second up actually Coolermaster really
really close within a voter to
them so for that reason again I'm going
to be doing a Liam Lee case based system
but that's for the second system I'll be
talking about today first system is
going to be the entry-level x99 build
and this is actually the entry-level x99
build that I did all the way back in
2015
August of 2015 and gosh look at it here
only 881 dollars now but bear in mind
that's because two of these two very
important products here aren't available
anymore the x99s Li has a new version
and the r9 390x so those aren't being
included if you added the prices of
those it would still be in the twelve
thirteen hundred issue dollar range but
I'm happy to say that for this
entry-level x99 build I was able to get
the price down so eleven hundred and
seventy seven dollars and again this one
that I did back in August 2015 was about
fifteen hundred dollars as it says here
up at the top at least with the current
prices at the time biggest question I
had for this system with which CPU to
use because if you're going x99 using
x99 chipset motherboards LGA 2011 -
three is the socket so that needs to be
compatible and there's two series of
CPUs Intel host released they have the
original haswell-e CPUs and then they
have Bravo II that they launched more
recently so I actually wasn't sure
whether to use the lowest and Broadwell
ee chip which is 260 800 K or of course
is 5820k which came out a little bit
further back but I actually went asked
you guys on Twitter and although there
was again many opinions on both sides of
it the winner here was 60 under K for
$420 so that's what I used although you
can get a 5820k
for 370 dollars so if you do want to
shave some some money off you can do
that also if you're just looking at CPUs
that are compatible here you will also
find a bunch of Zeon's and I felt like I
needed to point this out if you really
want to get in on x99 LGA 2011 - 3 for
as cheap as possible you can get a Xeon
and you can actually get 6 core even 8
cores eons for down below $300 however
all of these eons are pretty seriously a
hamstrung when it comes to their
frequencies so I was like oh why you can
get an 8 core Xeon for 300 bucks but
it's 1.7 gigahertz
so if you do need the cores and the
threads ASEAN is very very viable option
in this range but my thought was the
5820k in the 6800 k run it at just
faster clock speeds out of the box and
they're unlocked for overclocking and if
you're building a system like this I
really feel like you should overclock it
and I also wanted it to be at least
somewhat appropriate for gaming as well
so for that reason I ruled out the
Zeon's but I do want to point out that
there there and then again because of
the strawpoll I went to 6100 K so this
one cost about 410 to 420 dollars right
now again it's more expensive as
compared to the mainstream CPUs but it
is a six core 12 thread processor and if
you want it even cheaper if you can walk
in somewhere if you can find a micro
center that's local to you to walk into
they're selling it for three hundred and
eighty bucks but again that's in-store
pricing only so not everyone has access
to that
now these unlocks processors from Intel
don't come with a an air cooler or any
cooler at all so I'm with the hyper 212
X again this is entry-level so I stuck
with the budget and I'm really not
paying too much attention to aesthetics
with this build but for 45 bucks here
you get the hyper 212 X which is already
a very well known good cooler with
direct copper heat pipe contacts but you
also get an extra fan and cooler master
extra ship some pretty nice fans with
the hyper 212 X and these aren't the
ones with LEDs at a clear look on them
either so I thought 45 bucks that would
do a really good job for motherboards
there's lots of x99 motherboard options
around the $200 range and I was looking
at some of those but then I decided to
go with the asrock X 99 extreme for
mainly because you can get it for 160
bucks even 140 dollars if you include a
$20 million rebate and overall not a bad
board I mean you have a pretty decent
cooling and power delivery for
overclocking it's got pretty much the
feature set you'd want including ultra
MDOT two tons of SATA connectivity eight
DIMM slots so you're going to get the
job done here I don't really like the
blue you know if I'm being honest the
blue doesn't really match too much as
anything but again
I'm not carrying about aesthetics with
it with this build I'm caring mostly
about price and performance for memory I
have a 16 gig kit because you don't want
to take advantage of quad channel you do
still have four additional DIMM slots
open so you could expand this in the
future memory prices have gone up
unfortunately so a 4 gig a 4 by 4 gig
kit is costing about 95
books right now this is the ddr4 2400
memory kits from g.skill and again it's
not going to match all that great or
anything but it's going to work just
fine I also want to point out that one
of the advantages of going with a 6800 K
instead of the 5820k is that you do have
support 428 gigs of memory which the
5820k does not so that's kind of nice
for storage I went with my kind of
standard baseline configuration of Tula
what I find is acceptable for storage
which is going to be a SSD first for
your operating system and main programs
and I find that a 240 or 256 gig SSD
will give you a little bit more space
without being too crazy expenses and
then also an additional hard drive to
provide mass storage since 240 Giga SSD
is going to fill up pretty quick
can still get the SanDisk SSD plus not
the fastest SATA SSD but still quite
fast and will give you the SSD
responsiveness that you need for 70
bucks and that's still a pretty good
price SSD prices and memory prices have
been going up recently so that kind of
sucks and then a 2 terabytes a Hitachi
desta our hard drive this one is a kind
of a standby available for about 55 to
60 bucks on Amazon I'll get you some
storage and of course if you already
have an old hard drive one or two
terabyte or four terabyte hard drive
lying around just use that and it'll
save you some money here's probably
another controversial decision for this
build I went with an RX 480 and I like I
like it because it's an 8 gig card so if
you're doing stuff like OpenCL that you
can do GPU acceleration with you get 8
gigs of memory with this card it's much
more reasonably priced than some of the
higher end stuff like a gtx 1070 or even
like a an RN i in fury or something like
that those tend to be at least 70 80
bucks more expensive than this this is
an aftermarket cooler done by power
color it has good good ratings across
the board so you get an 8 gig R X 480
with an aftermarket cooler and if you
include the rebate card you can actually
get it for 200 bucks at Newegg right now
so that's the same price you pay for a 4
gig RX 480 and it's a very good card and
the other thing I'll point out is if you
don't like this that GPU configuration a
GPU is such an easy thing to upgrade and
swap out in the future that will be easy
to do for a case I had also many options
that with the cooler master and 400 this
is an ATX case very standard
get it for about fifty to sixty bucks
and it's got lots of ventilation this
was my main thing because they are
putting some higher-end hardware in here
it's got a full mesh front with fan
intakes there it's got a fan tip intake
on the side you can apply directly to
your graphics card if you need some more
cooling there it's got exhaust at the
top as well as a rear fan and then
overall it's pretty well built
well-built case so yeah it's going to
fit all the hardware in there it's not
going to be the crazy fancy this case
you've ever seen but it'll get the job
done and then again having plenty of
options for ventilation that I thought
was very important finally maybe powered
and for that I went with the C Sonic s12
to again this is a price to performance
sort of option here C Sonic is a very
solid power supply brand this parcel has
a five-year warranty and very good
ratings for quite some time it's only 50
bucks you can get five dollars more off
if you want and of course the cables
suck they are ketchup and mustard but
when we're going entry-level and we
don't care about aesthetics there
there's some corners to be kept and
that's the one I cut so there you go
guys that entire build will cost you
eleven hundred and seventy seven about
twelve hundred dollars right now not
including of course an operating system
and peripherals and stuff like that
but I think that's pretty nice I mean
you're going to get a huge amount of
performance here and imagining this is
going to be geared more towards people
who are doing workstation tasks not just
gaining but other things as well because
the practicality of investing in x99
only makes sense if you're actually
going to do some heavy lifting with the
system so let me know what you think of
that build there and let's move on to
the next one this is a mini ITX build
it's KB light based so it's a Z 270
chipset motherboard and it costs $2,200
so this is pretty high-end this is
actually going to be the system that I
build this coming months probably in the
next couple weeks and this also so for
that reason I also have a Lian Li case
in here and the Lian Li case I'm using
cost $200 so because I'm doing this
system with a few external influences
such as the votes you guys did as well
using a Lian Li case as well as I
decided I wanted to be mini ITX so I was
looking at mini ITX really cases and we
how many cases tend to be very expensive
they're very nice but they're very
expensive so for that reason I'm
actually giving you guys two builds for
the Mini ITX cabe you like things so you
get a bonus build this week you get
three total builds
so this one is going to be $2,200 and
then I did a much more sensible version
that costs $1,200 so here's this one we
got a 7700 k with a 120 millimeter
closed loop cooler the coarser H 100 IV
- EVG 270 stinger corsair dominator
platinum memory and Intel 600 P SSD as
well as a SanDisk one terabyte SSD an
EVGA GTX 1080s at Lian Li Q 37 mini ATX
case Corsair SF x6 or what power supply
then after a couple not to of fans
because I don't think some lammle case
for being as nice as it is comes with
fans alright so here is the power supply
from the last build I don't look at that
let's look at the case first so here's
that case this is pretty new case so
there's not a lot of use on it yet they
should be sending this over to me and I
will be taking a look and giving you
guys some additional feedback on it it's
aluminum on the outside it also has a
tempered glass panels that are on the
front as well as the left side and a
pretty cool design I think overall I
mean it's a box design but you have SFX
power supply so the power supply doesn't
take up quite as much room so it's not
quite as huge but yeah I feel like this
case is really designed for to have a
240 millimeter radiator at the top lots
of the dust filtration there as well
that's nice so for that reason that's
why I want the 200 240 millimeter
radiator from from Corsair all right
here's the CPU 7700 K you guys should be
familiar with this highest and
mainstream kV Lake processor that's what
I felt was suitable for this build on H
100 I've H 100 IV - if you're going to
drop a hundred bucks on a closed-loop
CPU cooler in my opinion you better be
using the top-end CPU from at least a
platform that you're working on so
that's why 170 700 K originally I was
going to do this with a 7600 K hence why
I did this ii build for the motherboard
you guys may be happy to know that i
have not done any RGB requirements for
this and in fact I'm using the EVGA Z
270 stinger which doesn't have RGB at
all on it praise praise the Lord this
one is a little bit harder to find right
now but you can get it directly from the
EVGA website 470 bucks there's a couple
other places that had it listed but
stock was
a little little up in the air right now
so if you can't find it now hopefully
they'll get more of those coming and
soon from memory what with the 32 gig
kit because there's only two dimm slots
but I wanted to have lots of memory this
being a higher-end build over $2,000 of
course our Dominator platinum it's kind
of black and silver which is a color
scheme that I think that is gone which
for this build that has white LEDs no
RGB just whites and it's very fast
memory for an SSD I have the 600 P this
is an nvme SSD from Intel it's
definitely not nearly as fast as the
higher-end nvme SSDs but it is much less
expensive so for this one you can get a
512 for 175 dollars which way it may or
may not be worth the cost again if you
don't want to spend that much on storage
check out my other bills where I have a
more sensible configuration outside of
the SanDisk Ultra 2 because when you
work with the system it has all SSD
storage you get kind of used to not
having hard drive noise or anything like
that 960 gigs though this one's $250 so
again I'm spending a good amount of
money on storage for this build and you
could get by with less but I think this
is going to be very fast and also taking
advantage of some of the newer
technology on the platform you also have
the GTX 1080 in here and with an EVGA
card it'll match up nicely with that
stinger motherboard and I may have a
different cards in this that I use for
the build itself but that remains to be
seen well we'll talk about that later
this is the 1088 gig it's the super
clock version so it's got white LEDs on
it and yeah often middle it's a good
card and then we need a small
form-factor power supply a sfx power
supply to be specific not ATX this is a
600 watt version from Corsair it's it's
a nice little guy I've seen this some of
the trade shows that they've had it on
display yet it's got all black cabling a
very nice minimalist sort of when it
comes with the stickers and everything
not that you're going to be able to see
that in this case but the cabling I did
think would be important keeping that
all black now finally there are two 80
millimeter fan mounts here at the back
of the case you can probably see them
there on the right side so kind of a
different fan configuration but since it
didn't seem like there was a lot of
active intake as far as fans from this
case I decided to throw in a couple
these naktu Redux fans these are the
1200 rpm one so they'll be a little
quieter they have again a nice color
scheme there
sort of silver or kind of gray with a
darker gray so that's kind of going to
match with everything else they're 18
bucks each they're not to a fans you
know they tend to be more expensive but
um yeah all that will come together to
get to hopefully bill to make a very
nice $2,200 ish system but again if
that's a little bit too rich for your
blood you can sacrifice a little bit on
performance and still get a very very
solid build for about $1,200 so this is
my bonus build I'm not going to go
through all the parts in this one like I
did with the with the one we just went
over but 1179 is a total price right now
at least if you're buying in the US and
getting the cheapest price prices on PC
part picker
I dropped the 7700 K down to the 7600 I
included a air cooler a low-profile one
from be quiet you actually don't need
low profile for the case I chose the
core v1 from Thermaltake but it'll I
kept things smaller here so there's just
more room in the case and you can work
with it a little bit easier that's only
about 40 bucks
again same motherboard EVGA Z 270
stinger I think it's a pretty good deal
for an overclocking board 170 104 170
dollars when with a 16 gig kit instead
of 32 and that significantly reduces the
cost of the memory to go with low
probably profile memory here with the
Vengeance lpx little bit under that
cooler Oct try on 150 SSD the prices for
SSDs are going up but you can still get
480 gigs for 130 dollars this is 120
bucks like a week or two ago but there
you have it and then gtx 1070 does
Noatak many ones so again you'll have
plenty of space in there and again the
Thermaltake core v1 mini ITX case and in
AC sonic power supply 550 watt 80 plus
gold semi modular again this one has a
pretty nice all black cabling so they
have it less than $1200 for a very solid
mini ITX nice low small footprint mini
builds for gaming and whatever else the
heck you want to do with it anyway guys
that is all for my genuine no this
February that's all for my February
builds video hope you guys have enjoyed
it of course as always I love to hear
your feedback I love to hear your ideas
for how you might change and manipulate
the parts and swap this thing out here
or thing in there to make things less
expensive just bear in mind whenever
you're building a system there's always
requirements and you got to meet those
requirements first and then see how you
can fit everything else within the
sighs compatibility so that's why I do
these videos I hope you guys enjoy them
and a little bit out of them stay tuned
for my follow-up video on that system
that I build right back behind me that
should be up in the night of your week
we can ask and then of course I have
this still the one in the Lee Emily case
coming up soon as well so hit the thumbs
up button subscribe if you want to see
more tech videos just like this one and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><!-- lazyload--><script>(function(w, d){
