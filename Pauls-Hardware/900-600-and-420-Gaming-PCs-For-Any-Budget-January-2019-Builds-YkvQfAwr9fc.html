hardware this is my monthly builds video
for January 2019 I usually do this at
the beginning of the month I'm a little
late because there was CES and beginning
of the year stuff that went on but I
have two builds for you guys today a
$600 gaming PC and a $900 gaming PC
these are all based on my best choices
right now for what I think you should
get if you've got about that much money
to spend and of course if you want to
see an actual build put together check
out my builds playlist because today I'm
just going over parts lists I didn't
post a strawpoll last months but going
back to the one I did in November I sort
of wanted to rehash this the thousand
dollar PC in 2018 versus what you can
get for a thousand dollars now and
actually started this going for $1000 PC
I ended up with a $900 PC so that's good
news I suppose and of course if you're
going to vote on next month's check out
the straw polls linked in the
description I'm just going for prices I
want to know how much you guys are
currently thinking about spending on a
gaming PC and also bear in mind this is
just for the core components of the PC
itself not talking about a monitor your
mouse keyboard or anything like that so
let's get into the first build this is
the $900 gaming PC and I'm not just
going to talk about the parts that I
chose for this one here I'm going to
talk about my a thought process my
methodology for choosing the parts that
I did choose starting out with our CPU
which is an AMD Rison 520 600 and that's
usually what you might start off with
let's take a look at what you can get
for about a hundred and sixty hundred
and seventy dollars right now and
basically what you'll find from Intel is
a lot of dual core sometimes quad core
cpus but a lot of these do not have
hyper threading enables so you're not
only going to get two cores or four
cores for that for a six core 12 third
processor you can get the Rison 5 2600
for about a hundred and sixty-five
dollars the nearest competitor is the
Rison 5 1600 X which is just 5 bucks
cheaper so I really see no good
competition for this CPU in this price
range if you want a decent amount of
cores and threads and you don't want to
be spending $300 plus which is what I'm
gonna have to spend to get an 8 core non
hyper-threaded CPU on the intel side or
even more than that if you want hyper
threading and like the 9900 k is like
500 bucks so bang for the buck I think
this is the way to go and there's
nothing else that's really close to it
what's also nice about the 2600 as it
comes with a wraith spire cooler
installed which is a perfectly adequate
cooller to get you up and running
doesn't even look that bad performs just
fine you can upgrade it in the future
that's another thing I'm gonna focus on
as I go through this build is upgrade
paths because I want you to be able to
build the system right now for this
price but also maybe add to it in the
future that is the beauty of building
your own PC for a motherboard we have
the MSI B 450 tomahawk note the very
good ratings here on PC part picker as
well as over here on new egg it's out of
stock on new egg right now but this
board is gonna get you four memory slots
so you can expand your memory in the
future it has good power delivery so not
only can it handle some overclocking
since it's a B 450 motherboard but if
you're gonna upgrade your six core to
maybe an eight core in the future the
power delivery on this motherboard can
still handle it for only about a little
over $100 there are cheaper B 450
motherboards in this but they might
skimp on power delivery beyond that
there are some bells and whistles that
this is missing but it's a solid
all-around board for just over 100 bucks
and it also has video outs on the back
which is only important for the very
last thing I'm going to talk about in
this video more on that in a minute
though for memory I have a solid 16 gig
2 by 8 gig kit of g.skill ripjaws 5 this
is 3200 speed memory it's got a nice
black finish that's gonna match with
most builds and it should be rising
compatible you just need to enable the
XMP profile and what's Rison you don't
want to go for faster memory 3000 speed
or 3200 speed if you can afford it and a
16 gig kit for about a hundred twenty
bucks I'm all-in for that that's way
better memory prices than we were
looking at last year now you're gonna
want storage and for this I go for a 500
gig SATA SSD if you go on a PC part
picker look at storage user filters
choose SSD look at capacities in the 202
about 640 gig range that will give you
both 500 gig class SSDs as well as 250
gig class SSDs sort by price per
gigabyte and you'll find you can get
SSDs for his cheapest 10 to 12 cents per
gigabyte that means about 50 bucks for a
500 gig Class drive or even about 30
bucks for a 240 gig class Drive and
again there's lots of options down here
some brands you may have heard of more
than others
teams l5 light is not necessarily the
best SSD but it's got your response time
it's gonna get the job done so it's
perfectly adequate to get off the ground
for an operating system drive one other
thing to point out here when you're
talking about storage you can easily add
more storage to the system so the 500
gig drive will allow you to install
windows some apps maybe a couple games
but you're probably
to add to this in the future but that's
a really simple upgrade for graphics
card we now have the GeForce r-tx 20 66
gig available this just launched there's
quite a few of these available for about
350 bucks I went for this model it's 10
bucks more but get a bit better of a
cooler with a dual fan solution and a
nice clean looking backplate this will
get you GPU performance about in the
same range as a gtx 1070 or 1070 TI
looking back to last year so it's a saw
a deal I think for that price lastly we
have a case in a power supply and here's
where you have a ton of options as well
the case you should spend probably about
forty to sixty dollars on the power
supply about the same I have a cooler
master master box case right here which
is on sale it's only temporary so you
might not be able to still get this deal
for the MB 600 l if you wait a bit
longer but there's other cases in this
range and this is just a nice case
well-built it's only got a single 120
millimeter fan so consider adding a
second one there but it's got a power
supply basement it has an acrylic side
panel so you can still look in and see
your builds and buy it within the next
11 hours or so probably by the time this
video goes up or else that deal won't be
there anymore I like for the power
supply the EVGA BQ series 600 Watts 80
plus bronze rated for about $40 again
there's other options for this but
you're looking for black cabling 80 plus
bronze rated or gold rated if you can
spend a little bit more money on it
partial modularity is nice so you can
leave out the cables that you're not
going to use and if you are looking at
other power supply options just make
sure you're going with the reputable
manufacturer EVGA does a solid job
Corsair C Sonic and Coolermaster all
solid options there but there you have
it though that is my build for just
under $900 for all of those components
and I wanted to compare this to the one
I did back in December and I bear in
mind the price has gone up for this
because some of the components I used
have gone up in price but this was 1127
or this is 1127 if you were to buy it
now it still has a 2600 a B 450
motherboard a very comparable memory
configuration it's got a bit nicer of a
storage drive but that 1070 TI is now
four hundred and seventy dollars which
just is very impractical if you're
comparing it to the RT ex 2060 and then
you can see my case in power supply
we're just a little bit more expensive
as well so that's what led to the total
price here of 11:27 and I think bringing
that down to 900 bucks for just about
the same performance is is a good deal
so yay 2019 let's move on to my other
this is a $600 gaming PC and for this I
took three of the same core components
because again I wanted there to be an
upgrade past I want to build the system
for a lower price but of course you
could swap in the components for the
$1,000 version and get yourself better
performance in the long run now pay
close attention to the CPU here this is
the Rison 3 1200 which is $95
it's a quad-core processor there is the
Rison 2200 G which is an APU and I'm
going to swap that in at the very end
here and show you another alternative
here but if you're planning to buy a
graphics card out of the gate like the
Radeon rx 588 gig which you can get for
170 bucks right now go for this Rison 3
1200 rather than the APU
beyond that the motherboard is the same
the case is the same and the power
supply is the same but I still have the
price at five hundred eighty six dollars
and 13 cents right now and I did that by
going with that less expensive CPU which
is a quad core this is a quad core
without multi-threading so four cores
and four threads and it actually runs a
little bit lower out of a frequency than
the 2200 G the difference here is that
the 2200 G has integrated graphics so
this one is going to give you more
available PCI Express Lanes because
eight of them are not dedicated to the
graphics that means if you want to
expand your system in the future to add
like an MDOT to nvme Drive you'll be in
a better situation with this chip than
you would with the 2200 G that said you
do need a graphics card with the r3 1200
because it doesn't have integrated
graphics so for the $200 range right now
you've got the art x5 88 gig or you have
the GTX 1066 gig if you're looking at
both of those there's much better deals
on the RX 588 gig right now you can get
them as cheap as 170 dollars maybe $190
whereas the cheapest 1066 gig is two
hundred and fourteen dollars so for that
reason I went with the very well priced
power color red dragon which is
available for a hundred and seventy
bucks after a $20 mil and rebate dual
fan cooler on this and back plate too so
that's nice you could use the same
memory get that I had in the first build
and this one I saved about twenty or
twenty-five dollars by going with a ddr4
3000 kit this is also rip jazz 5 it's
also the red version so it might stand
out or clash with the color scheme a
little bit honestly it would probably be
fine the case has a red accent on it so
that's good just a little bit slower
ddr4 3000 versus the
200 kits I have a 240 gig SSD so less
SSD space but again still plenty of room
for Windows and a few apps and maybe a
game or two and with just those changes
we've shaved about $300 off of the price
and again we still have a lot of the
same base core components so you could
upgrade to the parts from that $900
build if you so desire I'm gonna do one
more thing here by hitting edit this
parts list and I removed the video card
and the CPU I'm gonna switch the CPU
over to the 2200 G which is still the
same price at $95 this has integrated
Vega graphics it's perfectly adequate
for 1080 gameplay I have videos on this
if you guys want to check them out where
I do some gameplay testing everything
and honestly it's good gaming PC
performance for integrated graphics of
course you're gonna get a nice bump up
if you go with a discreet graphics card
but that brings the total price for this
system down to four hundred and sixteen
dollars or thereabouts man we'll call it
four hundred and twenty bucks so with
this you could get away without having
your graphics card maybe add that in the
future maybe add any of the other
components from that nine hundred dollar
bill in the future or add more storage
or do whatever you want you have plenty
of room in this case since they
full-size ATX build so just to loop back
to my intro statement for anyone who is
looking to put together a gaming PC for
less than $1000 whether you're talking
about 400 about 600 or about $900 this
is what I'd recommend you put together
of course again you got flexibility to
choose your own case there's tons of ATX
cases out there that you might like to
look up better or maybe some features
there's other motherboards that are
adequate in this range too with the B
450 chipset that is the beauty of
building your own gaming PC you can pick
and choose the parts that you want the
best suit your needs
but hopefully this is giving you guys a
good starting off point thank you so
much for watching this video this is my
monthly build series I'll be continuing
this next month in February which is in
just a couple weeks already thank you
guys so much for watching and hit the
thumbs up button if you enjoyed it links
to all the parts lists and individual
parts are down in the description below
thanks again guys and we'll see you next
