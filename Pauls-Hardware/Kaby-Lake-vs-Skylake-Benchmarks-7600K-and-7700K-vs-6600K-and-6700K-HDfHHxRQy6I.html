Pauls hardware today's video is pretty
straightforward
I am benchmarking the new KB Lake
processors not just one but two the top
two SKUs that have just launched these
7600 K which is a quad core without
hyper threading and the 7700 K which is
a quad core with hyper threading I'm
going to be comparing them to their
direct counterparts on the skylake side
so the 6600 K and 6700 K I have six
benchmark sets I'm going to run through
three of them or more CPU workload
focused and three of them or more gaming
focused so let's start by going over the
testbed that I'm using right here to
test this all out on and this has been
done in an open-air environment for the
sake of expediency the motherboard I'm
using is the gigabyte or SC 270x gaming
seven brand new motherboard from
gigabyte they're now doing or to some
other boards the memory is Corsair
Vengeance 2 by 8 gig kit I'm just
running it at stock 2133 speed for the
tests for the graphics card I'm have a
gigabyte GT X 1080 extreme gaming this
one is manufacturer overclocked but I'm
just leaving it at the standard settings
as it came out of the box from gigabytes
for a CPU cooler since these CPUs don't
ship with one I'm using an air max ETS
t4 TB this one is nice because it has a
fixed backplate once it's on there so it
made it easier for me to remove it to
swap the CPUs out as I was going along I
also wanted something that was a decent
CPU cooler you can get this one for
about 35 to 50 dollars depending on
where you find the price although it is
a little bit more difficult to find now
but NMX does have an updated version
that's roughly the same I also should
point out that I'm not using the stock
fan that came on that cooler I'm using a
scythe gentle typhoon which is a PWM
optimized cooler for storage of Kingston
HyperX 240 gig SSD and for power I have
a Rosewell 1000 watt 80 + Platinum power
supply those are all the stuff that's in
there and let's quickly go over the
specs for the four CPUs that I'm going
to be testing I'll place them up
side-by-side here so you can compare and
you will find they're largely the same
especially if you're looking at the ones
that are in the same series so the 6600
K is 4 cores 4 threads
and then the turbo frequency goes up to
3.9 gigahertz that's supposed to be just
on one core but I found that on all of
these I don't know if it's a motherboard
or just some special magic that I have
in me but they were all just running at
their max turbo frequency across all the
cores so go figure but pay attention to
the frequencies though because that's
the main differentiating factor between
these CPUs the 7600 K the news KB Lake
version of the 6600 K turbos up to 4.2
gigahertz so even though everything else
is roughly the same across the specs it
is going to be running at 300 megahertz
faster out of the box and that is on all
four cores at least it was during my
testing also voltage for the 7600 K just
for those of you who are testing these
out new right now I was running out of
the box at one point two nine six volts
about 1.3 a little bit higher than I was
expecting actually all the CPUs on this
board were running a little bit higher
voltage that I thought they would but
fortunately most of them were okay
except the 7700 K more than that just a
second though the 6700 K as a fork or a
thread CPU again all the specs here you
should be familiar with if you've been
looking at skylake processors at all the
past year year and a half 4.2 gigahertz
turbo on this one as compared to the
7700 k for of course eight threads 4.5
gigahertz turbo and I think that's the
main selling points of this particular
CPU right now 4.5 gigahertz out of the
box and again it was doing that on all
four cores although when I first
installed it it was running at one point
four one six volts which is a lot more
than I would expect at least for just a
CPU out of the box and it was running
pretty hot at that voltage too so even
though that was was about it defaulted
to I manually punched in a - point 1 to
5 volt offset resulting in a about 1.3 4
volt max voltage under full load while
stress-testing typical gaming load it
was running at about 1.3 volts which I
found was a little bit more normal but I
didn't want to point that out since that
was a change that I made as opposed to
everything else which was running pretty
much at stock frequencies but I did want
to point that out since it's a change I
made a different from what it was
running at stock out of the box let's
move into our benchmarks now starting
with Cinebench r15 running on all cores
so as many threads were available to the
CPU as the CPU has 7600 K squared 681
he's 700k with its 8 thread scored 970
6600 k 6:30 and 6700 k 906 so this is
kind of what you would expect it's
giving you that you know five to ten ish
percent performance jump going from the
6000 series of skylake processors up to
the 7000 series cable eight processors
moving it over to single core mode that
gives you a better idea of instructions
per clock at least sort of a vague idea
of instructions per clock 7600 K here
scored 180 7700 K squared 194 then the
6600 K and 6700 K scored close to those
numbers but again just a little bit less
which is again kind of what we'd expect
for a the iterative changes that Intel's
been giving us with a generation to
generation launches CPU mark as part of
the pass mark suite but specifically it
has two CPU overall scores are listed
here 7700 K and 6700 K scoring up around
12,000 with again the 7700 K and 7600 K
outperforming by somewhere in the 5 to
10 percent range depending on how
accurately you do your math CPU mark has
a single core test as well and here I
want to point out the similarity between
the 7600 K and the 6700 K scoring within
5 points of each other and bear in mind
that those are the two CPUs that are
running the single core at the same
frequency at 4.2 gigahertz so food for
thought for later on let's move on to
Adobe Media encoder
this is cs6 version and it is rendering
a 4k video that's about 6 minutes and 50
seconds long for the 7600 K it took 27
minutes 7700 K took 23 minutes 6600 K
took about 28 minutes and that the 6700
K took about 24 minutes again we're
seeing differences here that fall in
line with what we'd expect given that
the 7700 K in 6704 more threads to work
with and of course the other differences
can mainly be explained by looking at
those clock speeds let's move over to
the gaming benchmarks though starting
off with 3d mark firestrike extreme
which run GPU intensive workloads as
well as some physics tests that gives us
more of an idea at the CPUs performance
now the graphics performance across all
these tests should be pretty much the
same since I'm using the same GPU with
note
Changez 7600 K squared 97 40 overall
take a look at that physics score of 93
87 and you can compare that to the
physics scores of the other CPUs such as
the 7700 K squaring 14300 the 6600 K
scoring eight thousand seven hundred and
the 6700 K scoring ten thousand two
hundred and twenty six and again if
you're looking at those combined tests
so the overall tests you'll find that
they even had a lot more it's mainly
looking at that physics test that's
going to give you the difference because
that is primarily where the CPU is going
to make a difference with this
particular benchmark x pi is a direct
x12 test and again has some tests that
integrate the CPU a lot more in fact
they have a CPU specific tests so again
here overall we're not going to see a
huge variance there all within about two
three four hundred points of each other
again that's largely due to the fact
that it's using the same GT X 1080 GPU
but with that CPU test we can see the
performance again fall it's pretty much
the same kind of layout that we saw with
all of the other tests and if you're not
noticing the trend here already the
trend is that if you look at the
frequencies that will kind of tell you
what the performance is going to be and
this is also why don't worry I decided
to overclock as well and I'll be coming
to those tests in a minute but first GTA
5 this using my standard test with
maximum settings right 1920 by 1080 so
it puts a little bit more of the load on
the CPU as opposed to the GPU and again
here we saw a little bit better
performance from the seventy-seven
arcane 6700 K but everything was pretty
much within line that 6600 K came in
last with D score of 129 average frames
per second finally we have civilization
6 also DirectX 12 tests using max
settings running at 1920 by 1080
I ran both the graphics test as well as
the turn average turn time test now the
turn time is the one that I actually
thought was going to show more of a
difference here because that is the one
that's supposed to be more determined by
the performance of the CPU as far as how
quickly the CPU can process the AI and
what it wants to do next when it's
looking at the layout of all the map and
everything that's there but not a huge
difference here it in fact is awesome
surprising upsets here with the 6700
a coming in with the lowest turn time of
22 seconds whereas the 6600 K up ended
it with 21.9 five seconds there and then
actually coming in first was the 7600 K
at the time of twenty point six six
seconds so probably some stuff remains
to be seen as far as how multi-threaded
the sip six AI test is because I'm not a
hundred percent sure but there you go
there's some game tests as well now
before I move into some overclocking and
some clock speed specific tests because
that's really what it came down to for
me was these all seem what they should
be but I'm not really I feel like I'm
not seeing apples to apples unless all
the processors are running at the same
frequency here are some temperature and
power draw numbers please take these
with a grain of salt the ambient
temperature here in my garage it's about
21 degrees Celsius during testing
fortunately it stayed that way because
it's kind of winter here in California
and max power draws for the entire
system measured from the wall and it
didn't really vary that much efficiency
between the quad core with
hyper-threading without seems to stay
relatively the same but let's move on to
the tests that I think you guys have
been waiting for the most these are the
overclocking tests and I'm only going to
be showing comparisons for a couple of
the benchmarks because honestly I did
not have that much time and CES is about
to happen I clocked all the CPUs to 4.6
gigahertz 4.6 that's a very slight
overclock for the 7700 K just from 4.5
to 4.6 whereas the other CPUs are
running down at like 3.8 3.9 got more of
a boost but this was to give a better
idea of straight instructions per clock
performance from CPU to CPU let's start
with Cinebench r15 running across all
cores and we see Equalization yes
the 7600 K at 6600 case Cori almost
identical the same as a 7700 K and 6700
K I will say that the KB Lake processors
are ever so slightly faster at least in
these tests so I guess we can give them
that but that's pretty much within
margin of error looking at the single
core results we see the same thing not
more than a three or four point
difference between all of the processors
and that's running on this
single-core on all the processors so
that's taking any advantages that
hyper-threading or multiple cores might
give them cpu mark again showed just a
leveling off of everything when
everything is running at the same
frequency ten thousand six hundred and
ten thousand eight hundred respectively
for the 7600 k and sixty-six hundred k
so the 6600 k here actually outperformed
the 7600 k at the same frequency but
again that's still within margin of
error for these tests so if I ran it
bunches and bunches of times I have a
feeling they pretty much even at to
where they're supposed to be and again
only about a fifteen point difference
between the 7700 K and 6700 K again with
the skylake processor winning out but
just just just barely
you could even really call that it win
if you're accounting for variances and
testing so I guess I had a I like I kind
of saw it coming when I when I was doing
the initial test and I was like I bet
these are going to do the exact same
performance if they ran at the claim
same clock speed so in conclusion clock
speed seems to be providing the greatest
amount of performance variation between
the skylake and KB Lake processors but
those differences between the processors
especially if you're looking at single
threaded performance pretty much
disappear when you equalize the clock
speeds which you can easily do with
these processors because there are all K
SKUs now with a 7700 K you are at least
getting a chip that guarantee can run up
4.5 gigahertz so I guess there's
something to be said about that
but most 67 or K is that I work with can
do that fairly easily as well there also
doesn't seem to be a whole lot of IPC
improvement instructions per clock
improvement if any at all over sky lakes
so if the question you're asking
yourself is I'm on sky lake now should I
upgrade to KB Lake it doesn't seem like
you really need to overclocking
expectations performance reliability
still remains to be seen with these
processors I've only worked with two of
them we need a much wider sample size
it's going to be a bunch of the other
people also posting their results right
now as well as a big overclocking event
the Intel is hosting at CES with
Hardware bots where they're going to be
doing a bunch more overclocking so
that's
thing that maybe could be said for KB
Lake but we just don't know yet
so it still remains to be seen whether
once lots of people start overclocking
these processors if they're average over
clocks with KB Lake processors might be
better than with skylake who knows it
might be the same it might even be worse
but we're going to need to wait probably
at least a week or two for a lots more
people to start posting their results to
get a better idea of that so to sum up I
wanted to point out that usually going
from one generation of CPU to the next
within cell you expect to see maybe a
five to fifteen percent performance
improvement on an instructions per clock
level for that new generation but KB
Lake just doesn't really seem to have
that that leaves the other stuff to be
your main motivations to upgrade like
new motherboard features and there are a
few of those that I've talked about in
my first five things you need to know
about KB Lake video you should click on
that it's leaked but also there's those
tiered features that they're blocking
people out of like support for opting or
4k streaming which honestly feels more
like they're purposely locked it's like
it's like that you need to have windows
tend to run DirectX 12 you know it's
like they don't have to do that they're
just doing that to force people onto the
new platform or into buying new stuff
honestly though what I really want to
see is what kind of pricing changes or
other shakeups happen in the CPU
marketplace when Rison goes on sale
AMD's promised competitor for Intel
which is supposed to happen in q1 but
apparently not quite yet that's all for
this video though guys don't forget to
hit the like button if you enjoyed it
you can also share this video with other
people if you know anyone who's
interested in KB Lake and particularly
some kb lake benchmarks because lord
knows these took a decent amount of time
and your feedback and likes and all the
