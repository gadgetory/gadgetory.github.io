you guys should be able to hear me now
many apologies for the lack of audio
just moments ago I'm in a double check
all right good I can hear myself perfect
would you guys like an explanation of
why but let's start with an explanation
of what this is in general because not
everyone has been watching life for the
past few minutes I have a 1 welcome to
Paul's hardware this is my live stream
for Black Friday 2018 I have a bunch of
deals that I've curated I've made a list
of them it's a Google Doc that's linked
in the description you can check it out
and click any of those links if you find
any deals that you think are good I
already tried to do this live stream
once there was no audio I have a brief
explanation for that I've recently reset
up my capture system with OBS and I was
doing some Game Capture and in order to
make it easier for editing I set up OBS
cos it's pretty flexible you can do two
audio tracks so I had one audio track
recording the Game Capture and add
another audio check audio check
recording the audio capture of what we
were saying that allowed my editor Joe
to go and work with both audio tracks
individually left that setting set
everything up today sound levels looked
good and everything because sound is
picking up but the track was selected
wrong anyway I fixed it everything is
working now good quick disclaimer the
links in the Google Doc down in the
description are all affiliate links so
if you do click them it will earn me a
small commission this video is not
sponsored at all though so you know I
didn't I didn't have anyone paying me to
choose these parts out I've sorted them
by category for starting with internal
components CPUs GPUs motherboards SSDs
memories power supplies and then we got
cases peripherals and some extras down
at the bottom so if you guys don't want
to watch me ramble about all the stuff
I've chosen then feel free to just click
those links and browse the products and
I will be updating this Google Documents
as the weekend proceeds so if I find
better deals
our fields go away then I will hopefully
update that so I'm gonna run down each
part I will go through this quickly so
we don't take too long on it but
starting with the first product here in
the CPU category is there isin five 2600
includes the race stealth cooler so you
don't need an aftermarket cooler it's a
hundred forty five bucks which is
fifteen dollars cheaper than the already
good price of about a hundred and sixty
dollars so there it is if you want a
nice mid-range bang for the buck CPU
this is widely hailed as being the best
bang for your buck right now if you
wanna upgrade a little bit though and
get yourself two more cores and four
more threads so 16 threads eight course
with the horizon 7 2700 you can do that
and you got to pay an extra hundred a
little over one hundred dollars more so
it is quite a bump up in base price but
if you don't want the most cores and
threads then the 2700 it's still a good
deal at 250 then we also have the
horizon 5 1600 and this actually is an
example of a price that has changed and
and gone bad so I know it's fixed look
look I've fixed it by refreshing alright
hooray well good this processor is $130
so it's only 15 bucks off the 2600 if
you can afford it then go for the 2600
but if you're really on a budget $130
for this six cores and twelve threads
great for gaming great for gaming and
streaming at the same time also includes
the race fire cooler so you don't need
an aftermarket cooler there great deal
and I'm glad the price updated because
when I did this 15 minutes ago I price
to jump back to up 245 if it's 145
dollars then get the 2600 over the 1600
okay finally we have a high-end desktop
processor from the AMD team this is the
first generation 200 for 1950 X 16 cores
32 threads for $450 note that that is
significantly less than what Intel
charges for their 8 core 16 3 at 9900 K
granted they're not as comfortable when
it comes to gaming but if you wants a
high-end desktop processor this is a
great starting out point for 450 bucks
and I even have a good motherboard to
pair it with in just a few minutes this
deal is good through Saturday as well so
cool finally here's a CPU cooler for
this category of the master liquid ML
360 R I've used this a few times it's a
great cooler down 225 bucks if you
include the $10 mil and rebate card
addressable RGB LEDs a good pump a solid
unit attire and cooling of course so you
know don't pair this with a 2600 that
would be silly moving on though graphic
skirts we have some Vegas so I'm gonna
start with AMD cards and I got some
video cards with AMD if you're gonna get
a Vega 56 or Vegas 64 if you can get it
at a good price and you're pairing it
with a free sync monitor you can get a
great deal this is still a little more
expensive but it is a deal's a day it's
only good for eleven more hours $475 for
in Vegas 64 overclocked eight gig a
third party design cooler from asus rog
Strix on there so that's a good choice
save yourself some cash though and go
with the blower style design the blower
style design kind of sucks as the cooler
goes but it's still perfectly functional
it's a graphics card maybe consider
upgrading the cooler with one of those
third-party add-on air coolers or
something like that you can do that but
400 ollars that's a good price for the
Vegas 64 as well if you want to save
even more money and gets close to Vegas
64 performance then you can get a bag of
56 and these are available for as cheap
as $340 bear in mind these Vegas still
come with the three game bundle pack
that you get so you you will get look at
three games along with it which is nice
here's the rx 580 you get two of the
free game two of the three games with a
580 or a 570 then you get three games if
you get a Vega 56 or 64 or the RX 590 of
course you're paying more money but 200
bucks for a Vega or for an RX 580 this
is the gigabyte version just 200 bucks
and here's a $200 MSI version both of
these are very similar so pick your
poison
both 200 bucks both rx 588 gigs
both dual fan coolers moving on though
some Nvidia graphics cards we got the
gtx 1070 dual 8 gig card so 10 70's you
can find for his cheapest $330 so there
was $330 EVGA card earlier today but
it's sold out so I went with this one
because it's actually in stock in sale
for two more days at this price this is
probably the the best bang for your buck
right now I've also included a gigabyte
version down there this is only 340
because of a $20 mil and rebate card and
the boost clock on this actually isn't
quite as good it's the Asus version but
I'm if the Asus version sells out
then go for the gigabyte version I guess
you have choices you have options here
is a slight upgrade from that the gtx
1070 TI and this is also a third party
or an atom or partner design a Zeus
Cerberus version 390 dollars for this
one also a good choice it's really hard
to say if you're comparing like 10 70s
and 10 8 10 7 TTI's to Vega 56 is in
Vega 64's really comes down to like what
monitor you want monitors do you want to
get if you're investing in a new monitor
and you want to get free sync will and
then the Vegas make a bit more sense or
if you've already got g-sync monitor
than the 10 70s intensive ATI is there a
good deal here is oh it's all that well
never mind that anyway this is a 1070 TI
asus rog 4 $430 but it sold out so let's
move on from that one we got a gigabyte
geforce r-tx 2074 $500 this is going to
be the base frequency version of the RT
x 2070 they can't ship you an
overclocked version one at this price
but you can overclock it yourself and
get yourself in the same range that the
$600 RT x 27 t sell for and in my
opinion if you're looking at a 1080 or
2070 and they're both 500 bucks you
should go for the 27 t moving on from
the other we have motherboards here is a
Z 370 the - a pro motherboard from from
MSI this is the Z 370 - 8 Pro it is $85
and if you want to get an 80 700 K or
any of the 8000 or 9000 series unlocked
CPUs and pair it with the relatively
inexpensive motherboard that you know
gets the job done it has a nice feature
set that's a good choice no no no no
okay thank you Ken I should also give a
shout-out to Kyle who somehow spotted
that my audio was not working in the
last stream and texted me to say thank
you to let me know so thanks to you guys
for letting Kyle enough to let me know
and thanks to Kyle for haha alright
moving on here is a really good deal on
annex 399 board x3 19 mm other boards
are often the bane of the good thread
Ripper deals because they can be very
expensive but this one's $210 it's an
Asus prime X 399 - a and and yeah I mean
debug LED on there again you
front panel USB 3.1 gen2 a good board
for $210 that's a that's a that's a
great markdown from that the the X 399 -
a gaming is only $240 - everyone's not
like to the description but you can also
consider it here's next $2.99
motherboard from EVGA this is the for
the win K for $150
this makes the high-end desktop
processors from Intel seem somewhat
palatable so that's a great deal this
was originally 350 so if you find a good
deal on a high-end desktop Intel
processor here's a great motherboard to
pair it with moving on we have SSD deals
though this one I tweeted out yesterday
it's a Samsung Evo 861 terabyte I love
one terabyte SSDs and when you can get
him down $428 that's great that's
fantastic this ones are really good SSD
- 4 SATA SSD you can get even cheaper
than that with the 88 a su 800 this is
also a one terabyte version for a
hundred and twenty dollars the price per
gig on these is just fantastic so either
of those you know her good choices I
guess the Samsung one looks a little bit
prettier though here's a WD black 250
gateway this is supposed to be the 500
gig 500 gig WD black 400 hundred dollars
marked down from 230 also fantastic deal
this would be a great operating system
drive for loading windows on and getting
the you know you frequently used games
and programs very fast drive very
comparable to like a samsung 960 or 970
Evo SSD and then if he wants a 500 gig
class nvme SSD that's not quite as
expensive as that 75 bucks for this one
that until 6 6 DP not quite as fast as
the WD but 25 bucks less great great
options I'm really liking that you can
get well priced
you know mid-range nvme SSDs for
operating systems now cuz they used to
be premium items now it's gonna be like
now you you want one of those let's move
on to memory I have a few kits here
they're all 16 gig kits to buy eight
gigs cuz I think that's kind of the best
mid-range you know getting that's what
most people needs most people don't need
more than 16 gigs and you can get these
down as cheap as a hundred bucks but in
the 100 to 120 dollar range this is a t
force Delta RGB which has real nice RGB
lighting on the top this is actually
very solid Kida memory
ddr4 3000
this is the only kit that I'm not
positive we'll play play nice with
horizon maybe the maybe the specs will
to us look here
3200 n right so this should play well
with Rison based on based on those two
reviews I just looked at here's of
course our vengeance LP execute this
should also play well with resin it's
also low profile this is a little bit
more expensive but very good
compatibility with this kit and again
the low profile look helps it fit
underneath lots of air coolers and stuff
hundred and thirty bucks for that one
not the most insane deal here's the team
T force Vulcan 16 gig kit that I
recommended a few days ago in my builds
video and apparently it's popular
because it's out of stock unfortunately
that's sad but don't worry it's
available in red so kit it in red still
can get it for a hundred bucks and you
know maybe it doesn't match as well as
the gray and black kit but you can't
still get the same memory kit same speed
for a hundred bucks still so that's cool
finally here's an XP g gamax d-10 kit
this kit should also play nice with
resin if you choose to install it in
that platform for $118 not quite as
little profile as the Corsair but still
pretty low profile and also pretty
minimalist you know it's not gonna be
flashy with RGB lights or anything on it
and some people for some people that's a
good thing let's move on to power
supplies ubj supernova 750 this is a
really good 750 watt power supply should
be good for any single car configuration
and even some dual card configurations
although might be a little bit short for
that but anyway Davey + gold it's 60
bucks that's a great deal it's also
fully modular which which is nice - all
black cables if you don't need 750 watts
and you want to save $10 here's the EVGA
supernova 650 g1 + pretty much all the
same stats wise 80 plus gold 650 watts
10-year warranty also fully modular 50
bucks
great great 80 plus gold rated power
supply solutions finally this one was
sent over on Twitter to me after I
posted the original link and I can't
seem to get this to always load up but
this you might be able to get this for
20 bucks the link in the description was
working for me before if you can find
this power supply for 28 bucks that's a
really solid entry-level deal it's 80
plus bronze rated the 500 BR from EVGA
for 4
one bucks don't buy this bye-bye the 650
watt $550 one that I just talked about
moving into cases though I don't have a
lot of cases so if you guys have any
find any case deals definitely share
those with me but here's the crystal for
60 X which is usually a sort of hundred
and fifty issue dollar range case for a
hundred and ten dollars with a bunch of
tempered glass that's also got RGB 3 RGB
fans included which is a nice add-on for
a case so 110 bucks for that moving on
though to peripherals Logitech G 9 10
Orion's spark this is usually again 150
ish plus class RGB mechanical gaming
keyboard currently on sale for $90
that's fantastic deal it's got some got
some cool features I personally have not
used this keyboard but I've spoken with
many people have and it's a pretty solid
choice I do like Logitech in their
peripherals here's one of my favorite
mice when it comes to comfort and
precision this is a newer version of it
but the Razer DeathAdder elite normally
around 70 bucks currently on sale for 40
if you're looking for a reasonable like
gift or something like this for a PC
gamer I this is a really nice Mouse I
just I just really like it it's it's
plug-and-play it's functional gets the
job done even cheaper than that we have
the Logitech g600 this is $25 and it's
also wireless it is listed as a gaming
mouse but I don't always like wireless
mics for gaming this one has multiple
buttons too and stuff like that so
that's that's pretty cool normally sells
for $80 so that's a great deal there as
well and then for a headset we have the
HyperX cloud alpha this is 75 dollars
usually sells for $125 HyperX is Cloud
headsets are actually very well rated
headsets can often be crappy and
inexpensive and you don't get what you
pay for but the HyperX stuff does a good
job and the cloud offer is a great
solution there so 25% off not bad
some monitors I really like this deal
and especially since g-sync monitors
tend to be very expensive this is the
rog swift PG 2 7 8 q are 27 inches 1440
one millisecond response time hundred
and sixty-five hertz
g-sync as well if you're looking at any
of those 1070 1070 TI and up deals great
great monitor to pair it with only
available for another 11 hours or so at
this price so jump on it normally sells
for 604
150 here is a free sink monitor that is
a bit cheaper but it's also 4k 28-inch
3840 by 2160 very good response time as
well on one millisecond and I believe
this is recent kiss also AMD freesync
compatible now it's 4k free sync so you
know you might not always be able to
play at that 4k resolution but you can
lower the resolution if you want and
it's three hundred and sixty dollars hey
I'm I'm in next up a few random products
yes and we're on the more under the
miscellaneous section some high-speed
microSD cards 20 bucks 428 gig one from
Samsung that's a good deal they're an
MSI laptop this is a a ti5 8300 HBase
laptop with a 1050 TI 4 Giga net eight
gigs of ram as well as a 16 gig until
octane memory SSD cache drive - along
with your one terabyte hard drive $700
that's not too bad this deal gets you a
little bit better graphics for 50
dollars more the eye 78750 also better
CPU and a GTX 1063 gig this is over at
Walmart but hard drive 16 gigs of op
same memory as well so the same storage
configuration pretty much $750 and then
some other miscellaneous stuff it's
great to have a webcam that you can just
plug in and use and Logitech as a from
there 920 series has done a great job
with those so 50 bucks for that one
these usually drop down around the
holidays so scoop one up while you have
a chance this is C 922 it goes up to
1080 resolution but if you want to kinda
have a little camera for streaming
that's a good choice there here's a big
ma a big TV let's say monitor flat 65
inch Samsung 4k TV for about a thousand
dollars it's about 300 bucks off I
thought this had HDR - yes hdr+
I don't know I don't know how good of
the HDR it is but it's got HDR here's a
10 gig gaming Nick I don't know why you
need a 10 gigabit Nick for gaming but a
quant eeeh you know add gaming to stuff
and it sells more if you're looking to
set up a high-speed network in your home
10 gigabit NIC is a way to go
just
beware that these switches are very
expensive too but ninety bucks for that
it's a solid deal and finally the Elgato
Game Capture 4k 60p Pro on sale for
three hundred dollars that's a hundred
bucks off usually sells for four hundred
dollars I've actually used this capture
card now just a little bit so far but
it's been working great auto-detects the
resolution and everything
it's PCI Express so you know you just
plug it in it actually looks pretty cool
too so it's not like you're gonna
install it in a system that you set up
with a tempered glass eye panel window
and stuff and it's gonna look ugly so
there's guys that is my Black Friday
deals that I have gathered so far but
like I said that's link in the
description to the Google Doc I will be
updating so if you guys have any
suggestions you want to leave them in
the description down below please do so

guys who donated in the first video
