right it went back down it went back
down it's fine it's all mines no it's
gonna hit a million any second any
second so that was about one month ago
on March 5th and that was the actual
time that I hit 1 million subscribers on
my youtube channel it was really cool
cuz it happened while we were doing our
live show me and Kyle awesome hardware
that we do every Tuesday evening and I
was able to share it with a bunch of
fans the people I think who watched the
show live tend to be fans who have maybe
been around a bit longer and to like
watching us in our natural state as well
as the more produced videos that we tend
to make from time to time but the point
being I wanted to say thank you this
video is all about saying thanks to you
guys if you watch my channel if you've
gained anything from it if you've
learned how to build a computer or if
you've just enjoyed trying to keep up
with technology as new products came out
or even the random things that we do
from time to time whether it's garage
work logs or anything else thank you
guys so much
sincerely from the bottom of my heart
for watching my content for continue to
watch my content it means a lot to me
and it's the reason I'm able to do what
I do every day which I really enjoy so
for today's video I'm gonna be doing a
quick reminisce a recap some nostalgic
looking back at my channel and how it's
grown over the years since I first
started it back in 2012 I'm gonna be
unboxing my 1 million subscriber plaque
which I'm so excited has finally arrived
and then of course I have a giveaway and
I'll be going over the details of that
towards the end of this video if you're
short on time or you're impatient though
just check the video's description
there's a list of all the prizes as well
as a link where you can enter wow that's
actually in 1080 I don't think it was in
focus here's my first video published
October 4th 2012 so that is about six
and a half years ago that is how long it
took me to go from zero subscribers all
the way up to a million and I should
give credit where credit is due this
isn't the first video that I ever posted
on YouTube for that you would need to go
over to the new egg studios channel sort
by oldest and then you can see my first
ever video on YouTube and that's right
here
July 9th
Nine's so they were looking at closer to
ten years ago the old intro was really
strange I don't know why I cut off the
top of my head in this video I was
reviewing a Samsung netbook you guys
remember netbooks those are popular
point being though if I look back I have
to give a huge thank you to new egg and
to a lot of the people who I worked with
there for giving me a starts and also
for the people who happen to watch new
egg TV back in the day because there was
a lot of people who watched there who
sort of came over and watched me on my
channel when I started it in 2012 I
definitely would not be where I am now
without the kickstart that I got from
new egg TV so a huge thank you to the
old new egg TV crew you guys know who
you are I miss you miss you guys all the
time I also want to use this moment to
clarify something because there's been a
long-standing rivalry between me and
Kyle ever since we both left new egg and
even though he has include Smee in
subscribers which I gave him full credit
for he actually has always claimed that
he started his channel first because if
you look at my first video that's
October 4th 2012 his first video
October 3rd 2012 yes folks one day
earlier but if you go and look at social
blade you can see that my channel was
actually created June 30th 2012 so I
believe I have the one-up on Kyle there
I did record some screen caps of some
milestones along the way so here's when
I hit 100,000 subscribers I had 4.1
million views and that was January 22nd
2015 the next milestone was jump into
200,000 and according to these screen
caps that happened in November November
12 2015 about 10 months later here's a
screen cap of my channel at the time
200,000 subscribers eleven point seven
million views we were on awesome
Hardware number 38 at that point and
look that's when I did with Jay good
times good times
300,000 came on May 19th 2016 I did a
little tweet to say thanks to everyone
for that one unfortunately I didn't get
a screen cap for 400 K but 500 K it
looks like was on March 12th 2017 I also
did it sweet to thank everyone for that
one things picked up after that it was
just three months later in June that I
hit 600,000 so sent another tweet on
that June 15th I did a screen cap of
this number because I did it I had been
doing giveaways at like 500,000 and so I
wanted to do a random giveaway to
celebrate Aranda
subscriber count' number so 655,000 482
and that was in September of 2017 700k
was December 3rd 2017 I had to wait a
little longer for 800k that came on July
20th 2018 although you can see I'm also
just shy of 100 million views at this
point and then from there jumps to 995
thousand I didn't get a screen cap at
nine hundred thousand but for that I
have to blame BPS customs or brian
because he did a giveaway that cal and I
participated in November of 2018 and
that got a bunch of subscribers for all
of us I actually jumped from like mid to
late 800 thousands up to the low nine
hundred thousands and that was from this
video right here but that pretty much
gives you kind of a bit of a timeline of
where my channel has come from and where
it's gone or where it's going in anyway
that's how my channel got to a million
subscribers long story short so I have
drawn this out long enough I've been
waiting so long I'm now going to unbox
my million subscriber clanking still
using my trusty spyderco tenacious sorry
any foam like this this Susan Susan
wrote me a letter oh look it's made by
society Awards okay so this is I think
this is a card from the company that
actually manufactures these youtube
subscriber Awards meanwhile Susan says
you're bigger than Vancouver bigger than
Venice you're even bigger than Las Vegas
1 million subscribers
apparently the next milestone is 10
million subscribers so I just need to do
10 times what has already been done then
that will be good enough for Susan well
I'll tell you what Susan thank you thank
you for this black aid I really
appreciate it he says we know that being
able to touch the lives of so many
people is reward enough but we're
incredibly proud of all you've done this
so we hope you'll accept this Gold
Creator Award as a token of our esteem
very nice card stock - it's gonna add a
bit of texture to it okay and and then
here it is my gold play button this is
amazing it's so so heavy nope got a
desiccant
mounting holes in the back all right
guys there it is my gold play button
it's got this reflective inner part and
play button itself doesn't do anything
when you press it got Jo in the
reflection there hi Jo hey speaking of
Jo in the reflection that reminds me I
was going to say huge thank you at the
end of this video but I might as well
say it now I haven't done this all alone
of course there's all of you guys who
supported me but I also have a bit of a
team that I've put together not quite on
the level of Linus Media Group or
anything but Jo my editor has been
helping me for several years now I can't
even remember when I used to do videos
without Jo self he's been helping me
film stuff as well as editing most of my
videos so Thank You Jo he's right there
if you guys want to say thanks to Jo I
think he's added a lot to the channel
and he's allowed me to make more content
and everything so that's fantastic also
a massive thank you to Jennifer who I
know from back in the Newegg days she
also helps me out a lot kind of in the
background she does ad sales and stuff
like that so Jennifer thank you so so
much for your help as well you're also
an indispensable part of this team it's
super sappy and now at the unboxing is
done the last part of this video is
saying thank you and a bit more of a
practical way I don't know how to
individually thank each and every one of
you other than saying thank you the way
I have in this video but there's at
least a little something I can do and
that is to give you the opportunity to
possibly win something so I have a bunch
of prizes now here's how this is gonna
work you don't even need to be
subscribed to my channel in order to
enter this giveaway there is a gleam dot
io entry link all you have to do is
visit a webpage because I don't want to
get YouTube mad at me about like having
subscriber requirements for entering a
giveaway all you gotta do is click that
link you can enter to win please use a
valuable email address that you actually
check on a regular basis because I'll be
contacting the winners in a couple weeks
and you're only gonna have 24 hours to
respond to me if you happen to be one of
the winners so please do so and there's
more details down in the video's
description speaking of details I wanted
to make this giveaway as international
as possible and for all of these prizes
that was my first question can you ship
internationally for the partners who
have contributed some prizes for this
giveaway long story short though most of
the prizes are available internationally
there are a few that aren't so hopefully
everyone will be happy with that at some
level it's really hard with these
giveaways to make everyone happy but
I've tried my best to do so
on this one let's go over the prizes
here is the full list we have Corsair
enter max NZXT toshiba as well as the
system that I put together just last
week that's being given away from
Corsair we have a Dominator platinum RGB
16 gig kit 3200 speed we've also got a
Corsair our MX series 850 watt 80 plus
gold certified power supply we have a
k70 RGB low profile mechanical keyboard
with Cherry MX switches and we've got
the iron claw RGB fps MOBA Gaming Mouse
so a nice assortment of products there
from Corsair Animax also provided a
stack of prizes so we have a 3-pack of
their new square RGB fans whenever these
at CES they're they're pretty nice
addressable RGB we have an aqua fusion
120 all in one liquid CPU cooler with
their really cool new design for the CPU
block with RGB lighting on it also a 240
millimeter version of that so a smaller
one and a bigger one we also have the
liquid tech 2 360 in white I covered
this recently and it's a it's a really
nice liquid CPU cooler especially if you
have something a little bit higher in
like a 9900 K and then one more a IO the
liquid Tec 2 240 so the smaller version
of the white 360 millimeter version
still has a 500 watt TDP rating for heat
dissipation so those are real nice
liquid coolers and then three power
supplies up for grabs from the
revolution DF series 80 plus gold power
supplies fully modular 650 watt 750 watt
and 850 watt these are nice little units
they have all black cabling and they
come with the accessories seen here so
anyone looking for a new power supply
enter max has a few available there to
NZXT has provided a hue to ambient the
v2 version of that so if you're looking
to deck out your computer with RGB LEDs
NZXT has a really nice family of
products that are all sort of focused
around the hue and the newer version of
those with the addressable RGB is real
nice also the Kraken X 62 which is one
of the highest rated all-in-one liquid
CPU coolers supports the cam software
and also has a real nice RGB logo on the
center there too from Toshiba we have a
couple SSDs there's going to be a one
terabyte class TR two hundred and nine
hundred and sixty gig version of that so
anyone who's looking to add a bunch of
SSD storage there it is and then we also
have the RC 100 which is that really
really tiny m dot 220 240 to drive
480 gig version of that it's nvme that's
real nice reading write speeds it's not
the fastest of your nvme drives but for
being as tiny as it is it's it's real
nice and then finally I have a full
