Nevada is brought to you by Coolermaster
enter max ocz Toshiba and deep cool all
right guys I'm over here with Toshiba
and I'm gonna check out some OCC
products and new storage products that
they have here we're at the West Gate
the West Gate in a suite I don't know
why I've been keen on pointing out to
you guys where I am every time but
anyway point being there's a really tiny
nvme SSD and there's an external SSD
that you can use for really fast
external storage with USB type-c
3.1 gen2 so starting off here with this
really tiny nvme SSD and if you guys
remember last year actually I came over
here to check out the Toshiba Toshiba
stuff and they showed me this little guy
teeny tiny little SSD so basically you
have the SSD the actual NAND flash
storage itself and a controller on this
teeny tiny little chip well they've
actually taken that and implemented it
into a product so that is what we're
looking at here the RC 100 series this
is going to be available in 120 240 and
480 gig capacities at least at launch
they're looking about q2 when it comes
to launch so maybe April May time frame
and as far as pricing goes I don't want
to talk about pricing right now because
NAND has been very expensive memory has
been very expensive prices have been
very high so the prices I might say for
this right now
are probably going to be more than what
hopefully it will be in the future
because we're really hoping that the
prices start to come down as far as the
240 gig model that they have here
they're talking about a sub $200 price
point so I guess we can leave it at that
beyond that though you have a teeny-tiny
SSD as apparently on the Toshiba social
media they tweeted a picture and
somebody said what is this an SSD for
ants anyway that's my best attempt at a
Zoolander impersonation but of course
you get to the benefits of an nvme which
is more power efficient and then of
course you get potential nvme SSD speeds
now nvme SSDs can be very very fast but
they can also be very very expensive so
this one's gonna sort of hit that sweet
spot between being expensive and being
fast so we're looking at about 1600
megabytes per second reads a murican
about 1100 megabytes per second writes
which is definitely significantly faster
your typical say to drive about three
times faster at least when it comes to
the reeds so that's really nice if you
can load up an operating system on this
if you can load up a bunch of games
they're gonna load really fast and
you're gonna have a good time so it
being very small of course is gonna be
able to fit into very small devices it
is actually a twenty to forty two so
twenty two millimeters wide and forty
two millimeters long you might be more
familiar with like 20 to 80 as your
typical nvme SSD that we get these days
so quick comparison here's their Rd 400
which I've used a lot in this past year
really solid and vme SSDs this one's
this one's still out and it's gonna be
faster than that one but it's also a
little bit more expensive but that's 20
to 80 that's twenty to forty two and
this is the RC 100 and it's very small
and cute oh yeah I'll saw a really small
form-factor pcs like an Intel look or
like the little mini pcs that I showed
you guys over at the zotac booth if you
didn't watch the zotac video check that
out it should be up my CES 2018 playlist
so we're over to the next product here
this is the XS 700 we're keeping it
simple over here at the Toshiba Suites
and we're just have two products to show
you this is an external SATA SSD so
basically you have effectively a SATA
SSD in there it's going to connect of
course by a USB type-c it's USB 3.1 gen2
which provides plenty of bandwidth you
are going to get SATA speeds on this
drive though you're going to get about
530 megabytes per second reads and
you're going to get about 480 megabytes
per second rates very nice read and
write speeds if you're comparing this to
other external devices you know like
your typical USB thumb drive or that
kind of thing so if you want to use this
to say video edit on the go or if you
need let's say you you go to lots of
land parties and you want to take your
entire Steam library and transfer it
really quickly to your friends so they
don't have to download the games that
kind of thing this is gonna be a great
solution for that I've actually been
using external 2.5 inches SSDs like the
TR 200 you guys have seen this on my
channel I've used it in a few builds
recently I use these with just a little
SATA external adapter which is effective
but it's also not necessarily the most
durable these SATA plugs can be well
that you can snap them off if you tweak
them at the wrong angle so having
something that's completely contained
like this
it's got the USBC connector they're also
going to include a tight
a adapter for it so you can plug it into
legacy USB ports and that is the XS 700
from Toshiba now this one's only going
to be available in the 240 gig capacity
right at launch but based on popularity
and feedback from fans like you they
might bring it in in a higher capacity
as well maybe 480 maybe we will even see
a 1 terabyte version in the future
I just made that up they might do that
they might not but guys that's gonna
wrap it up for my quick coverage here at
the Toshiba Suites here at the West Gate
and of course Toshiba is a sponsor for
this year's covered CES 2018 so a huge
thank you to them as well as my other
sponsors Coolermaster enter max as well
