this is probing Paul number 35 my
monthly Q&amp;amp;A I will be answering your
questions that were posted in last
month's probing Paul which you can check
out if you want to look at the probing
Paul playlist it goes back pretty far
these days that's impressive but I will
link that down in the video's
description all of the questions I'm
answering today are taken from the
comments of last month's video so feel
free to leave a comment in this month's
video if you're interested in me
possibly answering it next month if the
thumbs up button while you're down there
but only of course if you watch the
entire video and enjoy the things I have
to say let's get right into it with our
first question
this is from joon-tae and he says our
MDOT two heat sinks necessary I just
acquired a used motherboard and it
doesn't have a heatsink with it
no they're absolutely not necessary in
fact there's some sort of weird things
with them dot two heat sinks that not
everyone is aware of first off you don't
always need them depending on the speed
and performance of the drive the fastest
drives like Samsung's higher-end drives
like a 970 pro and 970 Evo can get
pretty hot if they're under sustained
loads for a very long period of time so
consider how you will be using your MDOT
to drive if it's just gonna be an
operating system driving a gaming PC
then it's not gonna get a lot of heavy
sustained use over time especially with
heavy loads from writes if you're using
it for video editing or something like
that well then you might want to
consider that it might get hot over time
but the other thing to consider is that
you don't necessarily want to cool down
everything on the SSD itself there is
the controller which you can sometimes
distinguished from the other chips
because it looks different you'll
usually have multiple chips that look
the same that's NAND flash then you have
another chip that's your controller
controllers you want to keep cool so if
you do get a heatsink make sure that the
heatsink goes over the controller but
not necessarily the NAND mantle actually
likes to be warmer it's better for nan
to be warmer while it's being written to
and then it's better for it to be cooler
when it's just not being used at all so
you actually want to avoid a heat sink
on the NAND for extended writes but you
would want to keep that controller cool
so that is really where I think the
problem and the confusion lies that said
for most SSDs and for most home usage in
a gaming system you're never going to
hit the SSD hard enough for it to get
warm enough and even if it does get warm
enough it's just gonna throttle itself
it'll dial back the speeds a little bit
so it doesn't overheat
and it'll still finish writing your data
it's not gonna suddenly explode or stop
working or anything like that so for my
money in most situations just don't
worry about a heatsink on your SSD if
your motherboard comes with one feel
free to go ahead and install it it's not
like it's gonna hurt the drive but
consider that a lot of SSDs now the
label that's on top is actually a
heatsink label it will help distribute
heat across the NAND chips as well as
the controller so if you do drop a
heatsink on there it is not a bad idea
to remove the label from the Nance the
Manns can actually get warmer and you'll
have better heat transfer from the
controller next question from David
Montaigne who says hi Paul of the series
long time watcher first time Probert
don't worry David you always remember
your first time but the question is how
can I benchmark my own games to see if
the FPS I'm actually getting is in line
with what I had expected from watching
Hardware reviews from yours and other
channels I'm feeling I'm getting less
than I should be this is a good question
I'm actually surprised it doesn't come a
little more often because when you look
at hardware reviews and benchmarks of
like a graphics card you'll often see a
$200 $300 graphics card paired with the
best possible processor like a $500 9900
Kay you might get that same graphics
card and install it on your system where
you're using a perfectly adequate r5
2600 or something like that but maybe
not quite the same performance as you
get out of a 99 hundred K and then the
question you're invariably gonna have is
why is my performance going to be a
little bit behind the professional
review that I've seen or have compared
to the best way to get a good idea of
this which is practically impossible for
most people is to finder a viewer who
has used your exact same configuration
and then even beyond that you'd have to
look at the specific settings they're
using for the game because they might be
running at high settings here there
might be one or two little settings that
they have changed that can significantly
affect the actual performance in that
game that you might not have set up so
David where I would point you actually
is synthetics in this specific
circumstance granted take the games that
you play try to find a diverse array of
reviews that have tested that game with
your hardware or at least your graphics
card and then you should be able to get
kind of a ballpark range of what you
should expect but if you can get a
synthetic benchmark I would recommend 3d
mark because they have multiple tests in
multiple DirectX 11 DirectX 12 VR and
ray tracing as well you can download
most of the
basic tests for free run the tests and
then you'll actually see all of their
results I don't have a direct example
right now but I pulled this image up
online because they give you this run
detail sheet where it shows your
performance and comparable systems
performance as well so you can look at
those charts and sort of get an idea
like is there something that's holding
my system back or am i kind of within
the range where I should be because
chances are if you are in the range you
should be but you're not quite where you
think you should be there's just some
minor things you could do like maybe a
little overclock or maybe you can mess
with your memory settings or maybe you
can again just double check the game
settings that you're using to make sure
that you've dialed things in
appropriately if you're comparing it to
an online test next question here is
from Mike the manic geek hey Mike
how you doing man he says how high PR
you over Borderlands 3 and if you aren't
typing why I am moderately IP I suppose
over Borderlands 3 because I didn't play
Borderlands 2 and I beat it and I played
through the whole game and you know
that's that's more rare for me these
days to have the time and be that
involved with the game to play it
through to the end so that you know
means that I enjoyed it so I would
hopefully enjoy the follow-up to it
Borderlands 3 and I probably I'm going
to try to play it if I'm not as hyped as
I should be it's because for one I can't
play as many video games or devote as
much time playing video games these days
as I used to which kind of sucks but
also kind of goes hand-in-hand with
getting a little bit older but the other
side of it is that as you guys probably
know I have a baby on the way should be
born any minute now and that will
probably take away a little bit of my
gaming time which I'm perfectly fine
with but it just means it's by the time
I get around to playing Borderlands 3 it
might be a little old but I'll
definitely play it I'm definitely
excited about it just not as excited as
I could be because I know I'm gonna have
limited time to actually devote to it
next question from Killers 34 should we
wait on Intel's 10 nanometre or pull the
trigger on the 9900 Kay
this is sort of the flip-flop to last
month's headline question which is
should you buy rise in 2000 series now
or wait for 3000 series intel should be
launching 10 nanometre desktop parts
this year it's still up in the air when
they're actually going to come out
there's speculation that we might see
something at Computex but according to
what Intel has said it's probably going
to be later in the year
so if you're already in that boat of
where you're waiting for what Intel has
next I would say keep waiting the ninety
nine hundred K is a very expensive
processor it's over five hundred dollars
and I'm gonna bet that when AMD launches
whatever they are planning to launch
mid-year this year probably in June or
July it's going to put even more
pressure on Intel to be competitive to
come out with a good product not just a
good product but a product that they're
going to have to price more
competitively because they can only ride
on that sort of historical Intel has the
fastest processor for so long and if any
of the rumors are remotely true when it
comes to the performance of AMD's risin
3000 series we're going to look at a
much much closer race when it comes to
IPC performance single core performance
and that is where Intel has the lead
right now
so if AMD can bounce back with Rison
3000 series
then whatever Intel comes out with next
which I hope is good because they've
been working on it for like three years
this ten nanometer thing if not longer
than that then by the end of this year
you should have a lot more options a lot
more performance available on the table
and you should have better prices as
well so that would be my recommendation
right now don't grab a ninety nine
hundred K they're very expensive
just just wait we've got a lot of stuff
coming out later this year and prices
for everything else like SSDs and memory
and everything have been coming down as
well so I think you'll be in a better
situation here is a long question from
JJ Bonifacio it's a question about an
upgrade from an existing computer which
he lists here at the top which has a
4690k as e97 X gigabyte motherboard a
Radeon 390x GPU 16 gigs of memory and a
C sonic power supply he's planning on
handing this down to his nephew and
building a new system and he wants to
know whether he should wait for third
gen or not or go the 2700 x route his
planned upgrade is a rise inside 2600 x
with a gigabyte p450 motherboard a 1660
TI still 16 gigs of memory but faster as
well as a m dot to nvme SSD to terabyte
hard drive fantex eclipse P 400 JJ I
will tell you that this is a good plan
that you have here but because you're
already using a 4690k I would say you
should hold off before now because just
as I said to previous question asked her
about the 900
okay we're looking at a bunch of
upcoming launches both from AMD and
Intel right now if you were dealing with
an older system like that you were
really struggling to get by with I would
say you know go ahead and invest right
now because you're gonna be getting a
nice upgrade but you've got a 4690k
that's a good gaming processor
especially if you overclock it a bit
390x
also still has legs on it I mean if
you're gaming at 1080p that should be
doing a perfectly adequate job for you
if your nephew is like about to steal
your computer then maybe you've got no
choice and you just need to invest now
but I would say because you're working
with a pretty good existing system hold
off a little bit because in given
another month or two I think we're gonna
be looking at a refresh to landscape
when it comes to the CPU side new
motherboards lots of cool stuff like
that and I think it might be worth the
wait just a couple more questions this
one's from Daniel red zinyak who says
Micro Center has a 1600 that's the rise
in five 1600 480 bucks I guess this
isn't a question it's more of an FYI for
you guys blessed to get a motherboard
with you get an extra $30 off
here's that actual deal at micro Center
even even advertising right here safe
thirty bucks when you bundle bundle
looking compatible eligible motherboard
micro Center has insanely good prices on
CPUs and I feel like I bring them up
from time to time but I haven't for a
while so just to point it out to you
guys who might not be aware that micro
Center exists you have to go in store so
that is the downside to it so there's a
lot of regions that just don't have
physical access to a micro Center
because there's not one near you
I have one I can get to down in Santa
Ana and the reason I even brought this
up today was because Joe my editor is
actually picking up horizon 5 1600 for
the build testing that we're going to do
tomorrow and it's it's only 80 bucks
there online you can get them for a
hundred and fifteen dollars which is
still a really good deal but $80 plus
the $30 off of a motherboard just just
crazy good I I'm jealous
for those of you who are able to buy a
setup like this right now compared to
people who didn't have access to that in
the past I guess anyway just kind of an
FYI for any of you guys who might have
local access to a micro Center
definitely hit them up they don't always
list these on PC part picker and stuff
like that though so I'm you
I have to go directly and just make sure
they have it in stock and keep an eye
out for crazy deals on CPUs David SJ
next asks hey Paul does skipping the
commercials at the start of videos have
a negative effect on monetization
amounts as opposed to letting the
commercials run to the end he's a few
people and they haven't known I David to
be perfectly honest I don't know the
direct answer to your question either
but I'm pretty sure this is how it works
if you watch a pre-roll ad who plays at
the beginning of the video that I post
and you wait for until you can skip
because I always do skippable ads I
never do non skippable ads then I get an
impression for that and I believe I get
commission from the advertiser I think
sometimes they do set up special deals
or if it's a longer like minute or two
minute at or a full video and people
watch the whole thing then I'm it might
give me more Commission but like I said
I don't know a full direct answer for
you maybe I shouldn't have answered this
question today but I do know that yes
even if you skip it I still get an
impression on the ad and I still get
some money for that so that for me is
like the best sort of in-between
I can appreciate anyone who wants to use
adblock or something like that don't
blame you guys at all there's plenty of
websites that that is very useful for I
recommend you block origin if we're
gonna do that but if you guys do like my
content like watching my videos if
you've ever gained anything from it you
want to whitelist me I greatly
appreciate that but I don't hate on
people who use ad blocker by any extent
but thanks for asking the question and
just having that in mind in general it
is a significant part of my revenue the
money I make and the way I'm able to
keep making YouTube videos like this one
so if you guys do want to waitlist me
cool do you want to watch the beginning
of those ads cool if you watch the whole
thing that like don't do that cuz I mean
if it's if it's interesting that's
interesting and useful to you then maybe
you can thank you very much though David
last question here I guess this is not a
question this is just I wanted to end
the video on this note from mark Andre B
2019 is the year of Paul and we should
Paul all the things which I just think
is great I actually hit like on this
comment right after I took the screen
cap in case you're wondering whether or
not I'd like to comment yes Paul all the
things I don't exactly know the right
procedure of implementation of that
policy but I think we should full steam
ahead
on that as of as of today so you guys
have your instructions thank you so much
for watching this video and again if you
have questions for me
answer next month leave them in the
comment section down below thanks again
for watching guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
