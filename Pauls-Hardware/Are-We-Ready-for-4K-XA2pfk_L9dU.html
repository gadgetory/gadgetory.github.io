Pauls hardware today I'm very happy to
be bringing you part 2 of my 4k video
and today's video is all about are we
actually ready for 4k right now monitors
like this Asus PQ 3 2 1 Q are becoming a
little bit more available this one's
still quite expensive but I'm starting
to see some come in at the sub $1,000
price points but do we actually have the
graphics or GPU horsepower to back that
up and push that many pixels so that's
what today's video is all about I have a
bunch of benchmarks I want to share with
you guys I want to jump right into that
but first we need to establish some
criteria what is that what exactly does
it mean to be ready for 4k so I have two
points that I'm trying to hit one is 30
frames per second and we'll call that
playable because I know a lot of folks
Steve I'm looking at you would not even
accept 30 frames per second as a
playable framerate when it comes to PC
gaming and then we have 60 frames per
second which is good good framerate and
if we can achieve more than 60 frames
per second it means we can achieve very
playable games at 4k resolutions and
hopefully we can even do that with all
of the eye candy turned up to that end I
have a slew of video cards that I've
been testing out we have the Radeon r9
290x we also have the GTX 780 Ti and we
also have the gtx titan black some
really really powerful cards and i'm
testing one and two-way configurations
with all of those cards so let's jump
into the hardware and see what i'm using
for today's tests the test bed is one
you might be familiar with it's running
on an Intel Core i7 249 60 X at 4.5
gigahertz motherboard is an Asus Rampage
4 formula we have 16 gigs of g-scale
trying to X 2400 speed memory that's 4
by 4 gigs
quad channel we also have a SanDisk
Ultra Plus 256 gig SSD rules well
Hercules 1600 power supply and Windows 7
Ultimate 64-bit and as previously
mentioned testing on the Asus PQ 3 2 1 q
30 1.5 inch 4k 3840 by 2160 monitor and
I am testing these at 30 Hertz just for
the purposes of the benchmarks I know 60
Hertz is available on this monitor but
it needs to do multi stream transport
mode which means it actually treats it
as two separate monitors and
to remove that from the equation when
you're benchmarking the refresh rate is
less important than the actual frame
rate but the graphics card able to put
out moving on to the video cards I had a
decision to make here and I decided to
go with overclocking everything because
that's what I would do if I was trying
around 4k and also if you watch part 1
of this video I use the Krakken G tens
from NZXT to water pool my 290 X's to
give them some better performance since
they seem to deal with some throttling
issues here and there but I was able to
boost them up to 1550 speed on the
memory as well as about 1155 megahertz
on the GPU clock with two cards and
eleven seventy-five megahertz on the GPU
clock with one card the Titan blacks are
absolutely beasts when it comes to
overclocking out of the box even with
the stock cooler we are actually running
at 1218 megahertz GPU core clock and
also above the memory up to 1850 the GTX
780 Ti is I was able to overclock just a
smidge more 12 19 megahertz on the GPU
core clock is what they're running at
and the memory there again running at
1850 and now I think we can actually
just dive in and take a look at the
benchmarks and I'll talk you guys
through these so we know what's going on
first we have 3d mark 2013 the fire
strike demos and of course I start a 4k
video with non 4k benchmarks but anyway
I've had it stuck taking black numbers
not overclocked here so you get some
comparison numbers these are synthetics
but just look how those overclocked 290x
cards actually beat out the GTX Titan
why at stock pretty impressive 3d mark
11 is next and I guess I'm a
completionist so I included this as well
excellent performance showing by the 290
X is here and this is the beginning of a
trend if you're looking at the Nvidia
cards the overclocked GTX 780 Ti is beat
the overclocked tanking blacks and this
is only when memory is a de factor and
more in the
just a moment next we have image in
heaven 4.0 this is actual 4k of 3840 by
2160 it's humbling to run this type of
test with this type of hardware you can
see the frame rates are quite low this
is at 8x AAA which again is silly at 4k
but it really does bring the GPUs to
this means and shows just what kind of
horsepower you're going to need to run
this resolution with Max and eye candy I
want to mention that heaven 4.0 does not
use more than three gigs of VRAM in
these tests which gives you the
predictable ordering conceivable results
mutagen Valle 1.0 is next also running
at 4k look just how close that 290 X is
coming to the gtx cards Valley actually
will push past the three gigabytes of
VRAM usage and it's actually at a
specific point in the run when the rain
starts to fall and it really chugs on
the 780 Ti is with the three gigs of
DRAM right there and it crashed the run
with them several times hence you can
see the low minimum frames per second
with the 7080 eyes but these Titan
blacks did pull ahead thanks to their
six gigs of VRAM Metro last light is
next and this is an actual real game
excellent all of the single card
solutions actually hit playable 30
frames per second plus frame rates on
this test and we're still looking to
break the 60 though metro always has low
minimum frame rates I don't know why
BioShock Infinite is next in here I want
to point out that the 14 series beta
drivers from AMD that I'm using do have
some throttling problems still the
propped up pretty bad in the BioShock
Infinite test so you can see that
performance there's not as great but
excellent showing by the Nvidia cards
easily held over 60 frames per second
here moving on to Crysis 3 you'll note I
added another set of benchmarks because
I was wondering what turning down some
settings might do and
aliasing is probably number one choice
since it has less impact for fail I want
to point out I did notice a difference
going from anti-aliasing to not
anti-aliasing so test take Crysis 3 at
4x a a as well as 0 a a got a nice boost
from turning off anti-aliasing but you
would still need a two way configuration
with all of these cards in order to hit
playable and that's just goes
CryEngine it meaning far cry 3 is
another game that's saw significant
throttling with the r9 290x cards hence
the fourth performance by those also
this is a game that used more than three
gigabytes of vram when running at 4k
hence the really low minimum frames per
second on the 780ti s and the titan
black speeding these 780ti is in this
test
turning off anti-aliasing also put the
two-way nvidia cards into the acceptable
60 frames per second range so next win
their battlefield 4 is next I saved this
one for last because it's a popular game
for benchmarking and I am impressed that
all of these single parts in these tests
hit 30 frames per second or more all the
2-way configurations hit 60 frames per
second or more the 290x cards still
trailed the Nvidia cards in these tests
so I made kind of a last-minute decision
to do some mantel testing so we're going
to throw that into the mix in the next
set of benchmarks now quick note here
about benchmarking with mantle fraps
uses DirectX 11 so you can't use fraps
contestant Mansell I use the thing
called a frame latency analyzer
calculator a bit of software that I come
I'll put the link to this in the
description if you guys are interested
it's from a Czech Lipsyte so Google
Translate as you print but I use this to
parse the frame time log from
battlefield port and it provides a
comparable frame rate for comparison so
it adjusts your actual frame rate for
things like stuttering and scene
variability and gives you a copper bowl
frame rate output stuttering was
negligible here with the single cards
the two way configurations of 4k still
produce stuttering according to these
tests mantle definitely makes a
difference
so although it's not as significant as
in some systems some test you might have
seen online of a more CPU bound it still
gave the 290x cards less stuttering and
enough of a post to win out over the
Nvidia cards it's hard to say if this is
impactful in the bigger picture though
when you're talking about mantle unless
you really really really like playing
battlefield 4 and be almost exclusive so
now let's do some post benchmark
analysis and let's start off by talking
about vram because I have the 780 eyes
with 3 gigabytes the 290 X's with 4
gigabytes and the Titan blacks that have
6 gigabytes basically I saw a big
improvement going from 3 gigabytes to 4
gigabytes since you can definitely go
past 3 gigabytes with a lot of these
tests so going with something that has
four or more definitely will lead to a
better experience with 4k gaming also
why did I choose this particular
hardware these particular cards from AMD
and NVIDIA well I wanted to choose the
cards that gave the best performance
possible from team red and team green I
also wanted to choose a configuration
that was at least somewhat reasonable
when it comes to cost the three-way and
forward configurations just tend to
throw money at the problem and I know
this is still very expensive solution
but going from a single card to 2-way
configuration made the most sense to me
because that's where you get the biggest
boost after 3 &amp;amp; 4 white cards tend to
drop off when it comes to performance a
little bit more there's also quite a few
variables that go into testing of this
nature and there's definitely other
things I could have done first off for
the 290x cards with the NZXT Cragen's i
could have put some VRM heatsinks on
those and actually tried to kind of make
some of my own by chopping up some
aluminum heat sinks from some old video
cards decided not to go with those
basically because the 290 X's are loners
and I need to bring them back to work
and I would have needed to use some more
permanent thermal adhesive on those to
get them to stick so if you are going
with that solution definitely get some
VRM vrm heat sinks because the 290x VRMs
we're hitting 90 to 95 degrees Celsius
even with not extensively long benchmark
runs and long term you would want to
keep those cooled also temperatures I
didn't talk about too much so I guess I
can talk about that here even with the
Nvidia cards being overclocked and set
the temperature target to 90 or 95
degrees Celsius they were still only
hitting 75 to 80 the 290 X's were also
only hitting about 45 to 50 with the
water
so definitely a lot better cooling
performance there and led to some
increased overclocking although the
geforce cards were overclocking just
fine even with these stock heat sinks
there is tons of other sightings I could
have used I could have gone with mid or
her high settings instead of ultra I
could have gone with various different
anti-aliasing or other post-processing
effects basically just comes down to
time I did not have time to test every
possible variable but hopefully the
anti-aliasing on and off tests gave you
guys a little bit better idea and with
any of these tests you can always take
your game adjust your settings down
until you hit a playable framerate with
whatever configuration you happen to be
using there was some other hardware I
could have used the one I really would
have wanted to have tested out would be
the AMD r9 290 because it's very
reasonably priced card compared to these
other ones and definitely could also be
a bit more of a budget solution budget
quote unquote
if you're looking for 4k monitor
solutions so hopefully maybe we can get
some 290s in the future we don't have
any too 90s at the office right now so I
wasn't able to test those now the one
other thing that I was really almost
going to do I just ran at a time and I
wanted to get this video up this weekend
was when testing the AMD cards I was
using the 14.3 betas I could have gone
back to the 13 dot X X the wickel
certified drivers which don't seem to
have as much throttling issues I really
just ran out of time there as well but I
tried to point out to you guys when
throttling was occurring or at least
when it seemed to be affecting the
benchmarks a lot so hopefully that is
sufficient there but again with the 14
dot whatever drivers once they are
wickles certified hopefully that will be
cleared up and maybe we can see even a
bit more performance out of the 290 X's
and now at last I've rambled long enough
so let's talk verdicts are we ready for
4k right now no okay I'll say no if
you're adhering to the PC gamer standard
which is 60 frames per second or higher
and everything turned up to max all of
the eye candy that's generally what a
lot of people like to go for when it
talks when you're talking about PC
gaming and high-end gaming
configurations if you're looking for
that you're really not going to be able
to get at least with the triple-a titles
that are using a lot of graphics
horsepower it's just not there yet I
think we're going to need to wait till
next generation of graphics cards from
AMD and NVIDIA and then possible other
solutions
like maybe more mantle support in some
games or perhaps other solutions that
might somehow give us increased frame
rates basically hardware we're looking
for increased hardware performance but
I'll say yes we are ready for 4k gaming
one is if you're ok with 30 Hertz which
heck consoles gamers use it that's
that's that's ok 2 is if you're okay
with sacrificing some of the eye candy
some of the post-processing effects
anti-aliasing and that type of thing to
bring your frame rate up to an
achievable reasonable amount so that you
can turn vsync on and play it 60 frames
per second or at 30 frames per second so
if you're ok with that then yeah you can
4k game right now also I have to point
out again these are expensive
configurations so you need to have some
some cash on hand right now it's
definitely not a budget option but again
hopefully as a hardware is released this
year more monitors more GPUs from from
the GPU makers we might see increased
performance and more accessibility
trickling down for now 1080 is still
fantastic to play at so if you don't
quite have the scratch to get together a
4k setup just go for 1080 I think you'll
be you'll be just fine but lastly I
wanted to point out a quick warning and
that is that if you are going for 4k
check the monitor that you're using
because 30 Hertz and 60 Hertz monitors
are both available there's a lot more 30
Hertz ones that are currently out there
if you want 60 Hertz natively it's got
to have DisplayPort 1.2 it's got to have
a video controller that can actually
push a 4k signal at 60 Hertz rather than
what's in the Asus for example it uses
two separate controllers and simulates
two screens and definitely DisplayPort
1.2 or HDMI 2.0 once that becomes more
widely available but that's gonna wrap
it up for this video guys I really hope
you've enjoyed it I spent a lot of time
getting all this stuff together so I'm
edifying content I surely hope that you
guys have learned something and maybe
gotten a better idea of whether or not
you're ready to jump into 4k right now
or maybe put it off another year it's up
to you but let me know in the comments
what you think what I could have done
differently what I could have done
better love to hear that of course leave
me some feedback maybe a thumbs up if
you really enjoyed this video and we'll
see you all next time I'm Paul's
