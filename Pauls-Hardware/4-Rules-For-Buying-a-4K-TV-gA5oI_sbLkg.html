important specs are its resolution its
size and its price for this video I'm
going to assume that the resolution that
you want is 4k and after that you should
get the TV that has the largest screen
size possible while staying within your
budget of course whether that's 500
bucks
or $3,000 I recently spent just under
$800 on the 65 inch 4k LG TV which I got
at Target
after my wife spotted it on slick deals
with a very nice discount who by the way
I would not like to thank for sponsoring
this video because this video is not
sponsored by anyone so LG and Target and
slick deals can suck it not my wife
though actually point being that I
thought you guys might like to hear what
my other qualifications for a good
future ready for K TV were before I made
this purchase since it's probably a
popular upgrade item this holiday season
so here are my four rules for buying a
4k TV rule number one is seek the ideal
inputs for most people this means at
least three HDMI 2.0 a inputs with at
least one that is hdcp 2.2 ready hdmi
2.0 a will give you support for 4k 3840
by 2160 resolution as an input also HDR
wide color gamut and all that at up to
60 frames per second HDCP is high
bandwidth digital content protection and
although you might not like it we will
need that if we want to have support for
playing back copyright protected content
from an HD CP enabled source I would
also like to throw up DisplayPort here
as a potential ideal input but
unfortunately a lot of HD TVs or 4k HD
TVs do not have display for it as an
input you would want DisplayPort 1.4
ideally and that would actually be much
more common if you're buying a 4k PC
monitor but let me know in the comments
if you actually find a good full size 4k
TV that has a DisplayPort input because
honestly I would much prefer that to
HDMI 2.0 a or whatever if it's available
rule number two is have HDR make sure
your new TV has HDR support this is
going to separate models that came out
this year last year from model
that came out prior to that earlier 4k
TVs because this is a more recent
development often this will be listed
alongside wide color gamut with high
dynamic range source material and it
inputs to an HDR ray TV the TV can
display a much broader range of colors
and much like the jump from 1080 to 4k I
think it's display technology that makes
a big difference especially when you're
viewing it side by side with a non HDR
TV and it's worth being ready for rule
number three is know your panel
technology that's what the screen is
made of and what lights it up the screen
makes the colors the light lights those
colors up I'm going to keep this simple
not dive into too many technical details
I'll just tell you what's good and
what's not as good the best technology
right now for your your panel is Oh le D
that's just the best available Oh le D
stands for organic light-emitting diode
it doesn't require a backlight it's just
the panel which is the pixels that
create the color and then they also
light up so you don't need a backlight
for it so they can be thinner they use
less power they can also be expensive
though although they are much cheaper
than they were last year or especially a
few years ago the second best technology
for your panel is LCD in the front and
LED in the back so the LCD creates the
colors and then an LED backlight behind
it that shines through and lights it up
now LED backlight technology does have a
few variations so we'll start with that
from a relatively worst to best
we'll start with LED edge lit displays
that's actually what I got it's not
terrible but it's just not as good as an
LED full-array panel so edgelits is the
relatively worst step up to full array
and that's put LEDs across the entire
panel versus just on the sides of the
edges and then the best option you can
get for an LED backlight is full array
plus local dimming so you have LEDs
covering the back and then it can
actually dim parts of the screen that
should be dark for darker scenes that
will give you much deeper blacks as well
as the best contrast ratio available now
that's the backlight but what about the
panel itself that's the LCD in front
there are four main LCD types that
you'll probably see out there
tn VA and then IPS or pls which are both
kind of in the same category IPS and pls
are generally the best when it comes to
LCD display panels that's what I got IPS
it generally gives the best color depth
VA is all
so an okay standard too that's vertical
alignments and then standard pretty much
is TN that would come in last but again
it's still perfectly adequate it's just
you know when you're buying technology
there's always stuff that's a little bit
better so again from worst to best TN VA
and then IPS or pls rule number four
resist the curves this is just a pretty
basic idea curved TVs suck they're made
for group watching at least large TVs
usually are but with a curved television
there's really only a very small sweet
spot that you can sit in and it's much
harder to move around and watch from off
angles curved monitors like this one are
okay though since usually it's just one
person sitting and you can sit right in
front of it and that's much better
I just never really liked curved TVs and
like 3d TVs just never really caught on
with me so I don't think that's
something important that you should look
for so when my wife found that deal I
applied these rules and I ended up with
this TV the price was right and my only
compromise was the panel which is an IPS
LCD with led edge lighting instead of an
O LED but that's still a huge jump up in
size and quality from our old TV which
was a 47 inch 1080 by JVC if I added a
fifth rule here would be to make sure
that the TV has vaso mount support for
wall mounting I grabbed an articulating
wall mount from monoprice 4r so I can
still pull it out from the wall and get
back there at the inputs if I need to
but most all large TVs do have base a
mounting points so I didn't feel like
including that as a rule to wrap things
up though I have searched the holiday
deals that are going on right now and I
found a few 4k TVs that I feel meet
these requirements I have posted Amazon
links to those down in the description
you can check those out but just click
on them and check the model number and
then definitely check other retailers as
well because there's a ton of deals
going on right now for Black Friday and
the holidays let me know in the comments
also if you're going to be upgrading to
4k this year hit the like button on your
way out and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
