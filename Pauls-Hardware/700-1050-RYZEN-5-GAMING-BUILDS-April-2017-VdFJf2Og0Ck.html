monthly builds series this is my April
builds video every month at the
beginning of the month I do a couple
parts lifts prior to builds so you guys
at home if you've never built a computer
before if you're just looking for some
tips can find some good suggestions for
different builds at different price
points and for different purposes
this month's build of course are going
to be based on rise in five processors
which are not out right now but they
will be launching on April 11th so I
have 1050 dollar budget build in the
budget by the ways for the tower and all
the hardware inside not including Mouse
monitor keyboard and perhaps a Windows
license but for $1,050 a Rison v 1600 X
based system this is a six core 12
thread processor and that's also going
to have a gtx 1070 paired with it and
then for about $700 I have a risin 5
1400 build which is a quad core with 8
threads and that's paired up with an RX
480 and that's again 700 bucks so really
really good prices for these builds but
if you guys are interested and actually
me putting some stuff together then
definitely check out my builds playlist
which I will link right over here I look
I just finished my March builds it's
April now I'm actually like pretty much
caught back up now it's only the first
week of April and I'm actually doing my
April builds video this is unprecedented
and I'm very happy about it of course
there is some interaction with you guys
though you all vote on what I do every
month so next month in May I basically
have a bunch of prices listed here since
we're finally going to be getting past
this launch cycle that we've been going
through the past month or two so I
really just want to know what budget you
guys are mainly looking for out there
I'll probably choose a couple budgets
and do gaming PC's based on those but
please vote and let me know and of
course this month's build if it wasn't
already obvious our horizon 5 based
system based on last month's suggestions
and 1080i not as popular perhaps as I
was expecting but Vega is not out yet
still either so we were going to go with
the rise in 5 anyway so let's get
started with my first build $1,050 and
all these are listed over on PC part
picker links to the full builds as well
as individual parts and down in the
video's description so you get your 1600
X which is going to come in at $250
retail and if you don't want to shave
some
half the price of this system and get it
down below $1,000 definitely consider
the 1600 it is still unlocked and
overclockable and you could still
overclock it and get probably roughly
the same performance as a 1600 X of
course I can't say too much about that
yet because they're not lodged and I'm
still in the middle of testing by the
way should subscribe to my channel if
you want to see my test videos when it
actually comes out here's the lineup of
risin to 5 products though so again the
1600 X right up here at the top for 250
bucks shave 30 bucks off with the 1600
and still is a 6 quart well thread part
and then four hundred and seventy or
hundred ninety bucks you can get those
quad cores so for a cooler since I'm
basing my assumption off of what I got
here which is the 1600 X without a
cooler so I did add a cooler I've got
the master air pro 4 bear in mind if you
don't get this one and it doesn't
specifically say it's a m4 compatible
you will need to contact : master for
the am 4 mounting kit for this but they
will send it to you free of charge so
that's cool only about 40 to 45 dollars
for this one and kind of adding to the
range of nice air coolers that you can
get from the 30 to 45 dollar range you
got this one you've also got like the
cryo a gate 7 and a maxi TST 40 be quiet
has a dark Rock I believe it's done in
that range as well so any of those of
course will work I'm going to be using
this cooling master master air pro 4 for
motherboard we have the Asus prime v 350
I definitely would recommend a be 350
motherboard if you're going for one of
the rise and 5 processors you can do an
X 370 of course as well but they do tend
to charge at least a good 3040 bucks
more per board for that this one comes
in at a hundred bucks and as you can see
right here if run Newegg since they tend
to have good pictures it's got four dimm
slots for memory it's got a good PC I'm
sorry it's got a good MDOT 2 location
which you might be able to see which is
right here actually above the GPU not
stuck in below it where it's going to
get too warm that isn't that pretty
unique look black and red you're not
going to be able to see it inside the
case that I chose but other than that
it's an Asus board so you know it's
going to be pretty good quality and all
and that should get the job done for you
and again less than hundred bucks for
memory I wanted to make sure that we
were compatible and they could
potentially run at a higher speed so
I've been sticking with this Corsair
Vengeance kit because it's the one I
views you can easily run this at 2933 on
a writing platform and it's already been
validated across most of them other
boards that I've checked so that's why
I've stuck with it don't rule out other
kits especially if you can find
something reasonably priced that's
thirty two hundred thirty four hundred
thirty six hundred speed because getting
faster memory speed with Rison if you
can get it dialed in is very helpful for
an SSD I have a two hundred forty gig
SSD and I did this via a parametric
filter who knew the zotac made SSDs but
hey at least it's got a pretty
cool-looking design if you're interested
check out the parametric filter and you
can see other options that are kind of
done in the same price range basically
my goal is get yourself a 2.5 inch 240
or 256 gig SSD and you should be able to
find that for 70 to 80 bucks get your
operating system on that and a few games
and then I typically don't include
mechanical drives with these builds
because I find that most people have one
of those lying around so you grab one of
those format it and drop it in your
system so you have some additional
storage or if you really do need a
mechanical drive you can get a one or
two terabyte drive for thirty to fifty
bucks for a graphics card i have a gtx
1070 the one that's chosen here is the
zotac 1070 mini which is a nice little
card definitely gets the job done again
I'm using the parametric filter here so
I just wanted to find a gtx 1070 for the
most reasonable price and you can get
those in the 330 to 360 dollar price
range actually 335 for that ZOTAC card
so that's definitely the the best deal
right now
you got gigabyte and EVGA and other
options down here to those so if you
find one that's a good price so that has
a rebate or something that you find will
match it of course will fit in the case
then go for it for the case I have the
old standby NZXT s340 black and red this
is just a very solid case looks really
nice and it's only $70 I was actually
trying to find something that maybe was
a little bit less expensive than this
but I mean for the price and for what
you get it's really tough to beat this
340 there are a few other options down
in that range of course but since we
already had kind of a black and red
motherboard and did I mention that you
wouldn't be able to see the motherboard
I was kidding about that you will be
able to see the motherboard with this
build what's the cheaper build it's not
a Windows case so you won't be able to
see it but get yourself an s3 40 70
bucks
good deal and then finally we have a
power supply 650 watt EVGA one with
80-plus gold for this one because I
wanted a little bit better quality and
even then you don't have to pay too much
seventy three dollars for this one
with the $10 mil and rebate in the 7280
dollar range and I chose this one
because it's an EVGA 650 watt again gets
a job done partially modular but the
cabling is all black as you can see
right here so it will match and 80 plus
gold means it'll stay a little bit on
your power bill as well and there's my
1050 dollar bills and I wanted to
compare this to the $1200 HP build that
I did as four or five months ago now
also in an NZXT s340 but now you can get
a 6 quart well thread processor and
still get that gtx 1070 in there and
come in 150 bucks cheaper than you would
a couple well just like five six months
ago so that's pretty cool and definitely
one of the benefits that I was looking
for and hoping for when Rison launched
was just getting the capabilities of a
nice thousand dollar system within the
thousand dollar range and still being
able to fit high-end stuff like gtx 1070
and of course your horizon 5 1600 x next
we have a $700 rise in 5 1400 build this
is paired up with an Rx for 80 but man
700 bucks and this is going to be a nice
fast gaming system suitable for 1080 you
could even do 1440 with this system of
course at the heart is again that rise
in 5 1400 CPU this is the lowest end one
for 170 dollars from their eyes and 5
line but again all of them are
overclockable so I wouldn't be surprised
if you can take the rising 5 1400 and
overclock it and get basically in the
same range as you would expect with 1500
x4 less money of course for the
motherboard actually had a pretty tough
choice I was looking at all these
different motherboard options that were
b3 50 micro ATX down in the 7280 dollar
range and I ended up going with an Asus
again III was again trying to find some
other options there's a bio star and an
asrock and a couple others that are down
there but they all had compromises that
I wasn't quite happy with either for
example the m2 slot was tucked under the
the actual PCI Express slot which I
found to be kind of stupid here it's in
the right place on this Asus board
several of them were missing expansion
slots which I found to be kind of silly
for a micro ATX board these do have some
1x lot so you can get them in there I
think they're actually writing most of
your extra PCIe lanes to the m2 right
there this one also has four dimm slots
quite a few of the other ones in the
strange only had two so based on all
that I upped it to about $90 budget for
the motherboard and went with this Asus
one simply because of what's available
where it is on the board and I do want
to point out that the reviews from this
at least on Newegg are not spectacular
so far but I do believe that quite a few
of these motherboards have been going
through some growing pains and EFI
updates have been helping to solve a lot
of those issues you should still be able
to overclock on this board with an EFI
update at least same memory for this
system once again a cake kit ddr4 3000 I
just know it's going to work
I'm sorry not quite the same memory this
is an 8 gig kit instead of 16 but 8 gigs
you should still be able to get by with
and again four dimm slots so you can add
eight more if you decide to in the
future again I went with the the
parametric filter for storage so again
the choice here based on that would be
the zotac SSD but you can like get an
OCD try on 154 also 70 bucks or another
ZOTAC Drive and Enzo tech had so many
SSDs not offer look you can even get
this SK Hynix which is all white which
actually is a really cool design I like
that SSD that's what we did the white
build with like quite a few years ago
anyway so yeah I got the zotac again to
anaphora gig SSD in there and then video
card again I went with the parametric
filter choice again for this one is
going to be the msi RX for 80 armor but
again right around the 220 to 240 dollar
range quite a few options from MSI XFX
asus gigabyte so check those all out see
which one you like the best don't get a
reference design give something that is
a an aftermarket design like this MSI
one because they have better coolers and
they're going to keep temperatures down
and potentially allow you to have better
overclocking as well next we have a case
the thermal take versa H 15 this is a
micro ATX case solid reviews it's about
40 bucks it's going to get the job done
again it's not a side panel window on
there anything like that but plenty of
ventilation and again I went through
several reviews on this before I chose
it because they're all pretty solid
they're like you know there's nothing
super special about this case but it's
got some dust filters in there it's got
everything where you need it to be it's
micro ATX so it fits and yeah there's
there's your case finally we of course
need a power supply once again once
with EVGA because it's just I don't know
when I'm looking at the price and what's
there what's available is a pretty good
deal less than 40 bucks even again
another $10 million rebate you guys
can't see it because I'm blocking it but
there it is and the cabling on this one
is not good you do have ketchup and
mustard going on so bear that in mind
it's not going to be pretty but as 500
watts at 80 plus bronze it's going to
get your system up and running and
you're going to be good to go with a
$700 quad core 8 thread system with a
jeep with an Rx 480 in it that's it's
really nice for 700 bucks so I hope you
guys have enjoyed this video and stay
tuned because not only am i doing builds
I'm going to build one of these builds
probably the 1600 X based one because I
already have that on hand although I
think I might be picking up a 1400 as
well because I feel like that's a very
compelling chip I want to see how it
over clocks finally if you haven't
already subscribed you should because
dries in 5 reviews are coming really
really soon
April 11th again is the launch date for
these processors leave me some comments

you have any suggestions things you
would add to or take away from these
builds or feel free to post your builds
