hardware today's video is gonna be a
little bit different because I'm looking
for your feedback
my basic concept here is that I want to
make more videos and in order to do that
I think I need to make another video in
a style that's different from the ones
that I usually make something that's
actually a little bit simpler for me to
make on a regular basis but then also
hopefully something that I can do maybe
like once a week or maybe once every
couple weeks to give you guys a little
bit more content give me the chance to
actually show you guys some of the other
smaller projects that I might not in the
past have actually done videos on just
because they were smaller and simpler
ask you guys directly for feedback which
I'm definitely gonna be doing right now
and in a few minutes and then also just
give you guys some updates on ongoing
projects and stuff that I kind of have
coming down the pipeline so I am using
automatic settings on this camera but
you know what I don't care let's start
off on the garage with projects I have
ongoing why can this table here never
actually be clean I don't know I need to
clean out that table because I have some
builds that I need to do on it right now
I'm organizing all of my sound equipment
and that kind of stuff because I did get
a few new things okay over on the side
we have the Praxis wet bench I set this
testbed up before I left for Computex
and actually this motherboard was not
originally the motherboard I was gonna
use so a project coming soon is swapping
that motherboard out and actually adding
a water cooling loop I think what I want
to do with that which could be fun is
taking a lot of the water cooling stuff
I have like I have some old loops and
stuff up there radiators and whatnot
taking these what were originally
closed-loop coolers and like using the
components to make a custom loop on that
I might do that that could be fun anyway
over here we have a pile of too much
dust that I still need to get to the GTX
nad extreme from gigabyte that is coming
very very soon I also have gtx 1070 from
ZOTAC this is an air cooled amp edition
1070 and I think I'm actually going to
pit this against EVGA s I'm sorry not
EVT msi is seahawk because i'll do a
water-cooled vs air-cooled on that tuck
back here in the corner hiding because I
wasn't sure if I was able to show it yet
is the gtx 960 so of course content
coming on that as well I still can't
talk about that yet
I just can't tell you everyone go watch
Kyle's rap
about the NDA for that it was awesome
there's arctic panther you know just
sitting there I've been playing
overwatch out here from time to time
which is a lot of fun and I think that's
all for out in the garage here's the
dining room believe it or not it's not a
chaotic mess there is some stuff on the
table there but it's mostly clean this
table over here real quick though as
sort of a table of shame
it's just clutter clutter and storage
actually this is mainly where the dogs
get fed that's the dog food and mostly
this is dog stuff and everything but
this I'm going to come back to so this
will be my actual project for today
which is a fairly simple project but
this is my wife's old computer the one
that's being replaced by hotbox and I'm
going to be handing this down to my
oldest sister or handing it up so she's
older than me anyway I'll come back to
that and I'm just gonna reconfigure it
real quick and make sure it's okay to
hand off oh my god my desk is terrible
you think I would have gotten things a
little bit more organized in this but no
I'm not even gonna show you that anymore
let's look over here look at my wife's
desk look how how nice and fairly
organized it is alright so first up I
wanted to show you guys that yes hot box
is in use has been in use for a good
month now my wife has been using it she
originally started out playing doom on
it and now she's been playing all kinds
of overwatch and she's gotten me into
overwatch as well she's using my
Sennheiser headset because she likes how
comfortable it is and all that good
stuff and that they're not closed back
design anyway she has a 24 2560 by 1440
monitor there and a 1080 next to it and
she actually uses this for a dual
configuration so she has the gaming
system over here of course hot box and
then she has a work laptop and she swaps
those back and forth so you might notice
there's tons of cables and stuff going
on back here so another project that I
want to get done once hotbox is finished
is do a different setup here for my wife
to do it just to return a cable
management back there make things a lot
cleaner and everything and I think that
will help out a lot
the only other thing I wanted to show
you guys is that yes hotbox does need
some work because if you can't tell the
coloration and the tubing has gone clear
if you guys watch the hot box video I
had two different types of dye for the
for the coolant and I accidentally used
both I did not intentionally use both I
joked about it in the video but I put
the other one in and what happened was
they cancelled each other out
the video what you saw at the end of the
video it's it was that color and then I
came up the next morning and I was like
what happened to the color it just all
went away it doesn't seem to be
affecting cooling or anything like that
and I have been keeping an eye on it the
system is very stable and everything
right now but yeah I definitely need to
update that also the LED lights came
unplugged or something like that too so
anyway yes obviously obviously hopefully
still some work to be done on this but
fortunately I did get confirmation from
ek they were super busy with the launch
of the like the GTX 1080 and 1070 and
our X 480 but they have followed up and
they are sending me a few more parts and
adapters and stuff so I can reconfigure
and get stuff back the way I wanted it
so there is more coming on the hotbox
build you guys just gonna have to stay
tuned for that ok moving on to my actual
project I need to get done this morning
at least before I go to Steve's Steve's
having a party I'm going to Steve's
party anyway this is my wife's old
computer it's orange as you can maybe
tell there's a theme with the computers
I've built for her that's a z68 extreme
for Gen 3 motherboard from asrock it is
a 35 70 K in there I believe Intel Core
i5 and I think it's got eight gigs maybe
16 gigs of memory and whenever I take a
system an old system that's already been
in use and I'm setting up as a
hand-me-down there's three basic steps
that I go through one is checking which
hardware is going to go and which
hardware is gonna stay so you might
notice there used to be graphics card in
here that I have pulled that out because
my wife used this to game
my sister who I'm gonna be handing this
down to is not much of a gamer so she
doesn't really need the graphics card in
there
granted it's gonna be a large system
considering there's no graphics card for
what she's using it for but hey it's
gonna work so no worries there apart
from that once I've gotten the hardware
removed and have it set up the way I
want it as far as far as Hardware goes
of course I will give it a thorough
cleaning so I'm going to be handling
stuff like these fans which have been in
use for quite some time and have gotten
not terribly dusty but they definitely
could use a bit of cleaning off I might
just turn this is an orange LED strip I
have on there and I might just pull that
off of there because it's getting a
little bit faded over the years and then
the third phase is of course the actual
data management's basically going into
the operating system making sure
everything's backed up that it needs to
be backed up there's also an SSD and a
mechanical drive in there so I'm
probably going to pull the mechanical
drive in there and swap it in with a
something that's just already formatted
and an SSD I need to load up get into
Windows make sure everything's you know
saved if there's anything saved on the
desktop or my documents or whatever and
then I think I'm just going to do the
Windows 10 upgrade and force my sister
to use Windows 10 should be exciting
let's get to work
so there you go guys some updates on the
projects I have going on really excited
to get my wife's system finished off
actually and then also get to work on
her desk setup I think that will be a
fun video and I want to actually do my
setup too as well after that but some
that's further down the road anyway let
me know of course if you like this video
because that's really the point of me
making this video is to get your
feedback on if it's ok if I continue to
make videos like this in the future if
you want more content from me but you're
ok with the camera work be a little bit
shaky than the automatic settings and
all that good stuff hit the thumbs up
button to let me know with a comment
down below if not why let me know that
too because I'm always interested in
your feedback in the meantime thanks for
watching as always don't forget to
subscribe if you want to see more videos
or all the stuff I upcoming that I
already talked about and we'll see you
very soon in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
