us on your half like an hour guy like
wow we were really on top of things back
then someone just changed in the last
hour
yeah alright that's better
oh look look it looks like we're live
cool alright hi everyone and welcome to
awesome hard work this is a show about
technology we stream it live so
youtube.com slash Paul's hardware as
well as Kyle's channel bit wit every
Tuesday every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time we also stream live to
twitch.tv slash awesome hardware the
entire thing you're currently watching
the second half of episode 114 so if you
missed the first half you can catch it
on Kyle's channel again bit wit and that
link is in the video's description and
then you will discover how we have
gotten to the point where we're at right
now which is that we've discussed some
technology things we've drank a few
beers and we've generally had a
wonderful time
I think it's been yeah it's been great
so far has been great on my half of the
show we're gonna discuss mspaint which
is just massive controversy right now
with that other fascinating things we
have an actual an actual real live
thread Ripper motherboard an X 399
motherboard not not just like one of the
random samples that they show you it
can't be fixed or something no but the
actual full on retail box version some
of that information has been coming out
so we'll be going over that as well and
a quick word of warning to those of you
guys who are watching us we do drink
some beer on the show as we discuss
technology occasionally we let slip with
a pejorative or foul language to some
degree or an other so apologies for that
penis like Kyle's demonstrating right
now so we don't recommend this show for
youngsters or at least those who are not
mature enough to understand that it is
only in the most dire of need that grown
men other expletives in order to
reinforce
their point sir thank nothing we
generally cry the word penis at the
beginning of every show to deter all
them immature people away yes we do it's
a great way of doing that your people
only penis you're the penis call take it
away so I wish I had a song to go in to
say take it away public oh god this is
my music number yeah right now I'm
supposed to in the beat comes a new
music whatever we are drinking beer
though so a quick hello to the beer and
cheers to you guys I'm drinking Ellie's
brown ale which is from Avery Brewing
Company a delicious Brown Ale House
drinking ruined 10 Ruben 10 from Stone
from Stone aye it's a Stone IPA it it's
a 10.8% beer and it feels like it this
is the lots of heavy that's a heavy IPA
it's very heavy IPA it's usually not
quite that strong when it comes to the
alcohol content deep if you'd like to
help support our channels and support us
and the things that we do check out our
stores Paul's Arbor at net is mine look
at all these wonderful things I have I

trolley sold without 15 of them in the
last half of the show so they're going
fast it goes wait go ahead and buy them
up so check our stores out and buy stuff
thanks and your awesome
penis visions and penis fidget spinner
what's why there's a brilliant marketing
ideas from Chad as always that's the way
that's how you sell stuff yeah all right
seriously penises thanks to all of you
guys for joining us today love ya
okay and what's all this what's all this
hullabaloo about mspaint well I'm glad
you asked that Kyle because I do the
first story we're gonna talk about in
news is the death of Microsoft paints
and there's no paint no according to
this article and the verge is getting
killed off in the Windows 10 fall
creators update why that's not the
creator's update right now that is the
fall creators update oh my god so
obviously much sadness has spread across
the internet everyone loves paint paint
awesome
basically what's what all right so let's
be more specific here let's not read
Fudd or fear uncertainty and doubt and
let's give people the actual information
what has happened here is that Microsoft
has listed Microsoft Paint as a
deprecated feature in the Windows 10
fall creators update now what that means
is a deprecated feature is something
that will not be an active development
and may be removed in future releases no
that doesn't mean it's being removed
right now it just means they're putting
it on like the endangered species list
like this we get off this at any time
like it's there it's a life support wait
we could just kill it if we want does
this mean if you already have
m-miss paint it'll stay there or does it
mean even if you have MS paint already a
future update could wipe it from your
system as of right now it's not gonna be
wiped from your system or anything like
that so don't worry about Mike about
paint suddenly being gone because like
we said deprecated feature doesn't mean
it's gone right now it means they can
get rid of it in the future
presumably if they got rid of it in the
future and you were doing Windows
updates then yes the standard
application based launched this and it's
Microsoft paints might be gone then
they're getting random soon that's what
that's what it means there's no reason
maybe this unless they're planning to
get rid of it soon we don't know for
sure but we do know a little bit more
information about about about paint in
general now Microsoft has issued a
statement on this will
we get into in just a moment which will
pretty much clear up all its confusion
and doubt and everything but first a
quick look back on the history of paint
Oh does this sounds exciting yes a an
educational bit perhaps with some
research that I did earlier today
fascinating for instance did you know
that paint started as a 1-bit monochrome
version that was released alongside
Windows 1.0 in November of 1985 we've
come a long way you're right that's 32
years ago 32 goddamn years ago Microsoft
Paint came out its once of course widely
known for what you might be seen as
rudimentary or basic looking pixel
bitmaps that people design with mspaint
but it is also evolved over the years to
allow you to do other things besides
just draw in monochrome one bit color
and in fact now it serves as not an
equivalent to the photo manipulation
applications that you might have with
something like an Adobe Photoshop but
certainly something that is capable of
doing your basic copy and paste drawing
an arrow on something or making just
something that looks like a penis to
send to your friends that's what I
mostly which is one of the one of the
most useful things you can do for it so
Microsoft posted a blog and this is
actually from today so the paint news as
far as paint being deprecated kind of
dropped yesterday today though Microsoft
responded they followed up and they said
no look at this picture we drew in paint
that says we still love we still love ms
paint but they're still gonna kill it
they're not gonna get out of our system
so do not despair do not despair Kyle
the blog has announced that paint is
actually here to stay it will be moved
from its current home as a default
installed app with Windows to a free
Windows Store app okay I can live with
that
now I don't know if that means that like
the installed as a default will be gone
and you'll have to like go to the
Microsoft Store and look at paint and
call it either way but it will still be
that huge deal so they're not killing it
off entirely because of you who are
super worried about that but this does
seem like perhaps something that they're
doing in order to sort of keep people
away from paint just a little bit in
order to draw put more attention on the
replacement applications that they've
been developing like they have an app
called paint 3d that was launched with
the creators update recently it's a 2d
and 3d paint like app and you know what
I thought I thought we can do rares
assuming hold on hold on
do you use paint I use paint all the
time what do you use paintball paint
Paul paint do you use paint yeah I use
paints all the time I didn't do it's
great for certain very simple things
that do I know that's a creek maybe I
don't know the creators update on the
system yet paint 3d alright sorry I was
gonna I was gonna bring up paint 3d and
show you guys right now but maybe it's
pasta it's entirely possible that I have
not have updated the system to creators
update yet but if you have the creators
update then paint 3d is just there it's
just on your system but I haven't had a
chance to play around with it yet hmm
but there you go so paints it's not
going away but it is changing as far as
where it lives and who knows maybe this
is the beginning of the end as people
serve just slowly stop using it because
it becomes the thing that you need to
actively go and get rather than is just
there's yeah and as they start pushing
people into other applications that they
may be favored over paint because
they're younger and fresher you know
really perky breasts because here's
here's what I use them as paint for like
almost on a regular basis on a weekly
basis is when I need to show you guys in
some review or benchmark video that I've
done just a screencap just a generic
screen cap of my desktop with all of my
you know make my cpu-z gpu-z hardware
mod or all the statistics and data out
on the desktop it's easier for me to
just print screen and paste that into ms
paint and save it then da snip it
drugs then use the snipping tool because
as you and I both know call snipping
tool has a limit of 1920 by 1080 and it
won't yeah that's good anything further
which is why I've resorted this tippet
in recent years to just print screening
and pasting that straight into paint and
saving that as an image yeah so I can
later videos so this affects me like as
a reviewer in a deep way that I I'm glad
that I've you know we can excel access
paint I must open the App Store I mean
at least we have that but I mean for
benchmarking in particular like I find
it very useful to just take quick screen
caps and like you said really bypass the
limitations of the snipping tool yeah
stupid snipping tool yeah
snipping tool sucks snipping told me
it's not as a matter of like I'll miss
paint ms paint so much just like why the
hell don't you just make snipping tool
better I don't know thank you for
reminding me
thank you for let all the dog emojis in
chat um let's move on to our next story
though yeah Foxconn you guys are all
familiar at least to some degree with
Foxconn Foxconn is possibly going to be
investing in the United States their
Taiwanese based company of course whole
I'm really Creek did you know that
Windows key plus print screen will snap
a photo for you I didn't know that so
that's that's good to know
I'll try that out sometime instead of
having to use paint altogether if that
can just create the photo somewhere then
I've never done that before Windows key
plus print screen ever done never tried
it I'll try anything once
I'll try anything that sounds once that
sounds like it might probably specious
like that whole like oh I'll tell for
like press alt f4 that's a shortcut for
this yeah oh just try heroin once it'll
alright Foxconn reportedly is nearing a
decision to invest in a display factory
in Wisconsin here in the good old US US
of a Taiwanese that Foxconn is a
Taiwanese manufacturer and they might
hold an event in Washington DC as soon
as this week to announce some more
specifics on this plan to invest in the
United States the factory would make
display panels that could be used in
large screen electronics like
televisions according to this article on
Mac rumors which is where I'm deriving
this information the article
specifically says last month Foxconn
chairman
Terry Gow confirmed that Foxconn is
interested in investing at least 10
billion dollars towards US manufacturing
in seven different states Ohio
Pennsylvania Michigan Illinois Wisconsin
Indiana and Texas the the Wisconsin
factory that specifically being
referenced here would cost at least
seven billion dollars so that does eat
up a good 70% of that promise ten
billion but GAO said it could create
tens of thousands of American jobs jams
jobs which is which are good jobs in
America are good we want more jobs in
trouble yeah especially in the specific
states that might have suffered from
economic downturn such as what happened
in like 2008 and stuff like that so
we're all for more jobs but we're all
for honesty as well so to be perfectly
honest there is some possibility that in
their estimations of like look at all
these jobs as bringing in they may be
talking about the jobs that go into the
building of the plants and once the
plant is built because there is a lot of
automation
they're also talking about going on with
this plant the actual number of
long-term jobs that will exist after
it's built might be less than their
current estimation of tens of thousands
okay
so it is something to keep an eye on of
course because we want to make sure that
if people are promising to make
investments in America that Americans
are able to you know go and work and
make stuff and something like a display
factory that's pretty cool actually
of course Foxconn is associated with
Apple they make a lot of eye phones and
I iDevices and Apple devices and stuff
like that so it's possible that it might
not just be large-scale displays that
they're manufacturing here at this
Factory but potentially smaller displays
for devices like iPhones another Apple
derived things sure lord knows there's
no shortage of those but yeah good news
if you're in Wisconsin I guess and if
you're looking for a factory job and
again like we said hopefully lots of
those jobs are jobs that are here to
stay and not jobs that are just there
for like building up of this stuff
because yeah they're probably you know
Foxconn is not necessarily known for
treating its base level factory workers
employees with the most respect to me in
fairness to fairness and you know the
this is why they have smashed mat the
suicide suicide hats and all those
things sorry about the safety nets
around the borders of the lab ups where
the dutch-speaking see my solution for
the dogs is to yell at them and yell at
them that will make things even worse
I don't yell turn that off yeah DAG but
I would like them to shut up when
they're yelling when they're barking out
loud all right speaking of Wisconsin
Mesquite here's another Wisconsin
company I don't whether this is a
Wisconsin theme the hell's going on out
there oh my god
throat clearing and no sniffling yeah so
there's a company in Wisconsin called
three square market and they are gonna
have microchip their employees or at
least the employees that say that it's
okay as well they should
three square market taking those long
lunches microchipped bitch this video
playing that's that's the that's the
number one way you've company morale is
by just microchipping all your employees
to know that they are under lock at all
times and under supervision
might as well install like a freaking
camera in their eyelids that you see
everything they're doing this why is
this guy eyes these at one of the kiosks
or whatever it's the jews how we know
we're the future anyway so basically the
idea is that they're gonna get RFID
chips implanted in their employees this
is potentially for the sake of
convenience since three square market is
a company that provides technology for
many markets and kiosks this video still
playing stop it stop it Chuck so of
course they would be interested in
adding convenience for people being able
to you know pay for stuff at their
kiosks and whatnot
is it convenience or is it like
surveillance are people being tracked by
these implants that are going into them
probably not but but maybe but we can
speculate on that and say maybe I don't
know yeah or it could be that the
implant is the mark of the beast the
sign and sign of the beast and the world
is gonna end as a result of this clearly
CEO Todd Westby says this is the future
though this is obviously the future the
workers of this company three square
market are not being forced to enroll
but about 50 employees including the CEO
Westby and his family are all gonna get
chipped on August 1st cool just about a
week it's excited again the rest of the
employees they don't have to do this but
if they want to they can that I mean but
everyone else is doing it peer pressure
I mean no
yes getting chipped actually involves
getting a syringe that injects the chip
itself into the space between that would
be my biggest barrier to entry it's like
how big of a needle are you are you
going to stick inside of my body
oh that's it hell no I have good news
Kyle oh oh yeah
because you remember land syndicate
right I do
I remember Kane Gavin video of Kane
getting exact Jesus now now no Jesus
legacy no the needles so big goes right
into that space and it'll say big and
then it didn't see the body we can't
like talk and talk and talk side up oh
my god parents of that pieces of metal I
have in my ears yes some dust really my
hand it is an RFID chip that gets
implanted into your hands or it can be
scanned from six inches away and that
syringe containing the chip which is
about the size of a grain of rice it
slid underneath the skin between your
thumb and your forefinger the employees
of the company three square market can
use this now to open doors that require
identification cards to log into
computers to operate copy machines or to
pay for snacks out of the company's
vending machines it just seems like such
an invasive process to I don't know to
make very like simple like already
simple things easier like it's like how
much effort does it take you to open the
door like we're like to get your card
out to like open a door go through a
passageway like versus like how much
interference with your own body and
morals does that like the RFID thing
cost you like what well like we have a
quickie in your when we found it I was
like oh that's that's cool like it's
like steampunk and like future cyborgs
that's the only reason you would do it
in Cannes because it's gonna sound like
program stuff that'll work with it and
use it and everything like that but like
a company that's like hey all of our
employees get this now somehow seems to
just to move over into the area area
application or like oh that's a little
scary whatever like obviously this is
the first company that's done it and
it's only you know only voluntary or
whatever but still seems a little bit
scarier I feel like I feel like if like
honestly I have nothing against the
implants it's just it's just a matter of
like like I hate needles
first off okay so there's there's some
bias there who loves needles though who
loves getting injected the metal
barbs or whatever so like first of all I
don't like me a lot but I'd be so much
more into this whole thing if like you
could just do way cooler with it
then open doors so it's not like you're
 Magneto I mean if there was some
kind of universal identification system
that was like you know run by the
government or something like that then
theoretically it could be something that
operated as a universal identification
chip I don't know how often it would
need to be replaced through that kind of
thing yeah it is it is passive so it
theoretically cannot be hacked it's not
like somebody could walk by you with
some technical some piece of technology
that could suddenly reprogram the chip
so suddenly like you don't have access
to it or whatever it's there's no GPS
involved so it's not tracking you as you
move around or anything like that it is
purely an RFID bit of information that
can be scanned by a radio frequency so
there are uses for it but there's also
limitations to it but there's also
questions us to again how viable it is
for long-term use and also how regular
it becomes as far as something that you
can just like oh like here's a payment
method like let me just scan my hand and
now it's like gone and it knows my bank
accounts and it's taking the money out
and now I have this very convenient
means of pay or something like that I
would do it for that if you could just
like go to a grocery store and just like
pay for which it might be
eventually Wow I mean there's some
limited but obviously there's a lot of
there's a lot of pushback
got something like this the technology
itself was actually approved by the FDA
or FCC or whatever whatever governing
body needed to approve it approved in
2004 they were like that were there were
protests against it because people were
like oh this is like the sign of the
beast you know be some some permanent
thing that's getting implanted in people
or put on them or whatever something
like that
so his religious pushback on it possibly
and then there's also the price at least
in the article $300 a piece is what the
company in the Articles was charging the
company that Tek syndicate worked with
at lands etiquette was called bio
implants and I thought it was more like
a hundred bucks for the one that came
din but I don't remember exactly so I'm
not totally positive there but um yeah
basically there's no ethical or privacy
or religious concerns with the
psychology at all we should be well know
that yeah we'll do it together like the
day that either of us do it like if you
decide to do it one day I'll do with you
in a vice-versa
if I do it what you do it needs to be
useful enough to be worth it yes and it
needs to be something where I know that
there's a unique the information on that
chip needs to be unique in such a way
that I can go to wherever it might be
scanned they identifies its it is me
needs to be univer needs to be like no
possibility of somebody's being able to
like spoof that and somehow making it
pretend like that they're themselves and
then maybe it might be something that's
viable yeah and then that's when we'll
move into the end times and Jesus will
come back and the world will burn the
fires of damnation
can't wait ok next story of course err i
I tweeted this earlier this weekend I
know if you guys any of you guys spotted
it but it was a specific article from PC
perspective talking about Corsair and
Corsair potentially being purchased for
500 million US dollars
wow that's a lot this article is from PC
perspective it was originally sourced
from Reuters which was based on two
anonymous sources saying eagle tree
capital
is in late-stage discussions to acquire
course there
who the hell's eagle tree capital Eagle
tree capital is a private equity firm
with several backers including Goldman
Sachs the Macquarie Group and BNP
Paribas what does this mean for gamers
we don't really know yet because it's a
rumor and we don't know if it's true now
my initial tweet about this was
obviously but- this rumor is true is bad
news for fans of course there but I'll
be completely honest here
oh so you took a disliking to I saw this
and I saw this article from PC
perspective I read the article I tweeted
my initial response which is that
whenever I see large companies acquiring
smaller companies I have sort of a trend
a historical trend in my mind of the
companies that are acquired not doing as
well afterwards for a variety of
different reasons right there's another
article on New York Times about this if
you guys want to read some it a bit more
but both these are linked in the
description if you guys wanna check
kinda like they're moving further away
from their like original creative mantra
or you know whatever whatever sort of
beliefs that they had and we're now
being overrun by this larger
conglomerate company that's just sort of
a corporate machine to the thing
potentially yeah no no I I essentially
get that I see that so anytime again I
feel like that applies and we've seen
that happen area yeah of course not to
be fair after I made this tweet of
course they're actually got in touch
with me oh no take back every word you
 said Paul yeah but we'll never
give you another mid-tower case for
sampling and if he was yet promised then
of course there with a around
that's dated I'm trying to get a gun to
your head no did you see like course
there Justin that's you don't change
anything
oh no okay but obviously in a situation
like this
in a situation like this there are
sensitivities that need to be stopped
freakin the dog out nori
nari sorry Oh Kyle Kyle moves too
quickly and nori thought that it might
be something of concern okay
nori
okay so let me run through some of this
information since I have information
about this Eagle tree again as a private
equity firm they have several backers
including Goldman Sachs the macro
regroup and BNP Paribas Corsair as a
company you guys might be familiar with
manufacturers lots of things when it
comes to computers not just memory but
also fans cases CPU coolers and memory
devices USB there's lots of other stuff
external human interface devices
keyboard mice headsets lots of things
Corsair was incorporated in California
in January of 1994 they afterwards
reincorporated in Delaware under a
couple different names but they're
incorporated in Delaware they were
founded as Corsair Microsystems in 94 by
Andy Paul tom Lieberman and John B CLE
and Andy Paul remains the president and
CEO today Corsair had initial plans for
an IPO or initial public offering in
2013 but they did not continue after
they received a seventy five million
dollar investments from fransisco
partners now Eagle tree with their
potential buyout of Corsair would be
making it roughly 40% equity
contribution to the purchase price
they're expected to pay nine to ten
times Corsairs earnings before interest
tax depreciation and amortisation of
roughly 55 million dollars this puts the
value of the company at around five
hundred and twenty five million dollars
at the midpoints now my tweet about this
was obviously somewhat negative and
that's because I have seen companies
that get bought out by larger companies
that are then exploited by those
companies and that's a word that I hate
when it comes to business because
they're like how can we exploit this how
can we take this establish brand that
has a certain number of fans that follow
it and a certain number of experts or an
amount of expectation when it comes to
quality and service and everything like
that and how come we can then cut as
much costs as we can from the day to day
for ongoings of that company and the
production for the products that they
make to maximize the profit that we're
making
that and then ride that out for two
three four five years until people
realize from the public perspective that
that company has now gone to
because the focus is now a hundred
percent how much profit can be made
versus the quality of the products or
everything that goes into that so
basically you're saying like whenever a
big company acquires a smaller company
it's almost like that bigger companies
trying to just make a quick buck at the
expense no company that they bought
turning into an inevitable I'm
saying that can happen and I've seen
that happen but that does not always
happen but but that's the thing that
could potentially happen that could
happen yeah I agree but it all agreeance
1% but it all depends on the companies
buying the smaller company out sure and
how that company wants to treat that
company and there's some who's like
we've just bought this profitable
profitable company they seem to be doing
a pretty good job
let's leave the people who are running
that company in charge and let them do
their thing and everything's fine yeah
and from my perspective hopefully that's
what happens with course--a right if
this is true and of course there gets
purchased yeah but there's obviously
also the other route that it can go so
all this is to say that I myself from my
personal point of view and maybe you
guys as well would be keeping a close
eye on of course there and what happens
over the next one to three years or
months or however long it goes if this
is an actual thing that goes through and
actually happens because I don't know
about you guys but I like a lot of
course sales products we do I think they
have a lot of good people working for
them they do and I think those people
have a lot to do with the good products
that they put out absolutely and I hope
they can make they can keep doing that
yeah you usually usually when a bigger
company acquires a smaller company they
either just want to redo the carpets and
the floors and the ceilings they want to
redo everything and they want to like
bring in their own people and do a bunch
of consulting and or they're like
worry we acquired you because you're
you're already good you're you're solid
you owning much work we like the
creative aspect you bring and we want to
keep all the same managerial positions
that
currently have and just continue
flourishing that just now being under
our wing which is what I hope works out
for Corsair should they undertake this
deal is that all of the existing
managers and directors and executives at
the company remain where they are
because they're doing a hell of a job
Coursera is still pumping out some
pretty good products and it would suck
if some big ass company just bought them
out was like no no now a bunch of people
who have no idea what PC hardware even
means are in charge and they will be
making the decisions from here on out
and I feel like oftentimes that's what
can lead a company into the
when acquired by a bigger one is that
the creative direction is no longer
there and replaced as opposed to being
acknowledged and appreciated and yeah
and believed in it so so hopefully eagle
tree is going to bring Corsair on as an
asset that they hopefully will continue
to support to grow and thrive and keep
doing what they've been doing rather
than bringing Corsair on in order to
make as much money as they possibly can
out of them over the next few years
before driving the Corsair brand into
the dirt we will be keeping an eye out
and for now there's no reason to
suddenly decide that you hate Corsair or
anything like that but you know that's
the type of thing that we should be
aware of and well we'll keep you guys up
to date if we receive any more
information on that yep all right one of
our story here from the general news
segments and that is about a recycling
robots which I thought was David that
was kind of a robot named Clark yes his
name is Clark that's adorable it could
be the keys to reducing waste so I was
actually a this is a link to a PDF in
here so alright so Clark makes use of an
official and I'm sorry an artificial
intelligence to recognize and sort food
and beverage containers alone
make this figure recognize some sort of
food and beverage container go so you
can you can see this is part of Clark
right here on the right
he has already been deployed in a
municipal waste facility in Denver
Colorado he uses a visible light camera
to spot milk juice and food curtains and
pull them out using a remote robotic arm
and suction cups you can see right right
down there it's a highly technical yeah
that's super super it doesn't seem quite
as fancy when when it's like a conveyor
of up conveyer belts of that's
going by but it sure a lot its recycling
goes into the process its recycling
stuff so it recognizes the products the
items that it pulls out are diverted
from the landfill and sent to the
appropriate recycling facility Clark can
process sixty items per minutes it has
90 percent accuracy and it's about 50
percent faster than a human would be
doing the same task this results in a
50% reduction in sorting costs for this
particularly because then that greases
accuracy is not too bad it's not bad at
all
60 Em's a minute that's one item a
second I mean considering its literally
looking through the garbage and
that people toss in their in their trash
cans yeah and one item a second is more
than any to go in there and pull out
stuff you know like like plastic bins
curtains and that kind of thing right
now bear in mind so obviously you can
look at this from a very positive
perspective it's recycling saving the
planet right taking plastic and and and
doing good with it yeah yeah also
consider Clark is an AI based system so
the more Clark works the smarter Clark
gets oh no the article is quoted as
saying even though this first system is
picking up curtains it's actually
watching and learning
no from all the other commodities that
it's seeing as well what might Clark be
learning from those other commodities
only the AI knows for sure he's gonna
take over the world
actually right now Clark can identify
and say oh that's a number one plastic
bottle container but
I want it to be able to say oh that's a
Pepsi bottle that's a Gatorade bottle
they want it to be brand aware this is
exactly the information they need to
conquer the world
probably obviously Lord so we're all in
trouble people we're all in trouble
it's the recycle box obviously was sin
yeah our initial perspective about
Clarke here is positive you know he's
certain he's doing he's doing the Lord's
work he's sort of certain the stuff get
the recyclables about we just don't want
Clark to become self-aware he will
become self-aware in destroy so yeah
that's what Clark is most likely yeah
all right let's move on to our next
segment which is going to be how maybe
our buddy have you heard work so I have
a few bits of hardware to talk about
today let's start out by closing all
these steps just to make tabs up there
hold on hold on hold on I can't sleep I
won't be able to sleep tonight you're
worried about Clark having nightmares
about Clark's coming for me he's gonna
desert the coop the plastics he knows
the plastics from the aluminum's what
happened to that article of my article
disappeared all that yeah so the first
article in hockey hardware is about the
asus rog zenith it's 18 X 3 9 the red
ripper motherboard that on boxed who had
the privilege of Oh chip Hill had the
privilege of enough unboxing yes amazing
so this is a this is a video cards
dot-com article but it is via chip Hill
which is a Chinese language base website
and a series of pictures here unboxing
the Hardee's in this extreme is a
high-end motherboard now if you I mean
it's ROG its zenith they've never had a
Zenith before because I said og has
existed Eames E has not had a high
platform for them to need to create a
code name for it that's true which is
kind of cool so as eNOS is what they've
named this this would be equivalent to
rampage rampage yeah on the Intel side
and the extreme it means it's a pretty
damn high end it means it's got most of
what Asus wants to toss at it they have
a quick look at the accessory kit
is included here and you can see there's
lots of accessories and actually see
what is most likely a actual thread
Ripper processor right up here hidden
underneath what I assume is maybe it is
that a 10 Gigabit Ethernet card possibly
I don't know I would expect something
like a 10 gigabit ethernet card was
something like this possible I'd also
expect that they cost five to six
hundred dollars it comes with Wi-Fi
antennas a PCIe Ethernet card why would
they do an add-on card unless it was 10
gigabit there's no reason for them to
put an ad on of course the standard
Gigabit connector so yeah a VGA holder
which I maybe is this bracket right here
keep sag eliminate you sag the Asus dim
- extension card which I don't know if
there's a closer picture of but it says
India at least the dim slot if you go
out one picture to pick to pick in one
picture so the on the very right well it
looks like an extra dim slot here is
actually them using an existing dim slot
like it like a ddr4 slot took a piece
and put a riser card in that you can
slide in and MDOT - in - right
two of them right and then there's one
on either side maybe I don't know when I
saw it
Computex have like an MDOT two on either
side but don't quote me on that but
that's I'd be pretty cool if that was
the case that's possible Kyle you hear
from CalPERS your members but yeah Wi-Fi
antenna 10.2 card and there's an LCD
screen on there somewhere apparently to
the LCD I don't see the LCD screen I
don't know it's exactly about their dual
eight pin CPU power connectors that are
all both in the top right here so that's
also kind of interesting but yeah for
anyone who's excited about thread Ripper
this is probably gonna be a pretty sweet
mother board for its there's that dim
dot - card actually the expansion card
oh yeah there is so I should blow you
might be right actually Kyle because
there's a series of mounting points
right along here and then that it's a
secondary series right here
I only make sense if there was an
additional mounting point on the
opposite side yeah that's what I
remember from looking at the demos like
oh there's one on either side but you
know I think you are correct about that
one there cool so that is the ROG SI
units experience 399 motherboard view is
EA T X so it is large as well but pretty
cool to see right now
JJ actually did a quick unboxing of this
on his Twitter as well just recently
nice so I'm pretty excited about that
one very cool if I can get my hands on
it next up on how Navy Hardware this is
this is actually a hardware review and
it's just one that I thought you guys
might find interesting if you weren't
already familiar with it hadn't seen it
it's on gamers Nexus it's specifically
about streaming and gaming at the same
time or are the results on this I mean
eight core versus a fork or both hyper
threaded or you know whatever you want
to call it multivariate what what what
what what findings did they have I
didn't get a chance to watch this video
in its entirety but I saw it and I was
like this is gonna be a good video what
what did they find
worthy give us the give us the TLDR call
well here's the here's here's what they
did
I'm trying to cue this up so I can show
you guys very cute yes oh the way
Steven company did this particular
review was first off they went in to try
to figure out how to hack to you even
benchmark gaming and streaming at the
same time because there's so many
different variables that might come into
play sure when it comes to the software
you might use the encoding hardware that
you might use whether your encoding on
the CPU whether your encoding on the GPU
whether your encoding on the CPUs I GPU
yeah all those are different various
options that they might choose now what
the video the way actually did it was
they start off by showing the actual
performance without telling you which is
which and if you guys are watching this
right now you can probably tell with a
quick glance the one on the left is
incredibly smooth the one on the right
is dropping frames left and right so
there's the one on the right themself
CPU I don't know spoiler alert for any
of you guys who don't want spoilers stop
the video now and go watch that
but yeah the video the article as well
as the video are linked in this video's
description
so you guys can check it out but they
were testing not just the frames that
were outputs to the stream so they
monitored drop frames on the stream
itself they also monitored frames
delivered to the game itself and they
were just looking for a sixteen point
seven millisecond frame time or
maintaining a 63 64 fps sure just so
most people would want on your typical
gaming monitor sure they also test in
different situations such as upping
process prioritization so just so you
guys know since we've given enough time
since the spoiler alert here the one
that's all choppy on the right is a 7600
Kay the one on the left is the rs7 1700
so this has been stated quite a few
times that Steve says it's beginning of
this that you would expect a processor
with more threads and more cores to be
able to outperform a process of a fewer
threads and fewer cores when it comes to
something like being able to encode and
send a video stream to a streaming
service like twitch or YouTube then you
would with a processor with fewer heads
and three fewer cores they found that's
completely true the Rison 7 1700 with
eight cores and 16 threads pretty much
just destroys the 7700 k although the
7700 k can give you better strick to
gaming performance when all you're doing
is gaming when you're adding the
additional stress of gaming and
streaming at the same time the 1700 is
clearly the better option yeah at least
in this specific testing scenario like
we said there's different ways to set up
a stream there's a TVC encoding that you
can do on NVIDIA GPU there is h.264
encoding that you can do with the AI GPU
from an Intel CPU as well they weren't
necessarily diving into this they were
mostly focused on cpu streaming for this
specific test but they did a great job I
thought of laying out how the test would
run giving you the side-by-side stream
quality comparisons and
kind of teasing you not letting you know
what is which one is which at first so
you can sort of get the impression
before you know which one was which I
thought that was a good way of doing it
sure so rising 17 or 1700 pretty much
wins if you're going to be gaming
screaming at the same time that's
definitely a much better option than
Intel's fork or even fork or with
hyper-threading options Christmas jiminy
Christmas there's this big s dog here oh
but wow he's he's on top of things yeah
so yeah if you guys are interested in
some more detail check out gamers Nexus
they did a great bit of testing there
and I highly recommend reading the
article watching the video absolutely
it's good stuff ok final story here for
tech news and this is I'm sorry for hot
and heavy hardware this is about a Dell
monitor that was recently announced but
has gotten a bit of pushback for its
this is the del u 2 v 1 8 D monitor it
is a 25 inch 60 Hertz IPS display 2560
by 1440 1440 resolution
it's got hdmi 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.2
it's got very thin bezels as you can
probably tell from the picture here is
being advertised as being HDR compliance
however one is not even though it has a
$500 price tag it doesn't necessarily
have the rest of the specs when it comes
to the strict hardware performance that
you would need to line up with HDR
compliance that being it only is an 8
bit panel instead of 10 bits so your
color depth is obviously suffering their
HDR 10 which is the standard that's been
established by like the Xbox 1s and so
on requires a 10 bit panel it's also
only got 315 it's of brightness which is
low for HDR so you want a contrast ratio
of like a thousand one or better true
contrast ratio for HDR as well so it
just doesn't seem to match up to that
guru 3d pointed out specifically that
this monitor offers support for Dell HDR
which is simulated software-based HDR
mode that responds to HDR 10 content on
Dells display but falls short of the
color gamut
peak luminance
and bit depth that is necessary for true
HDR so the moral semi false advertising
like its HDR 10 compatible but it
doesn't quite pack all the specs it
probably to actually deliver that sort
of quality it's probably giving you a
little bit more than your typical 8-bit
IPS display but certainly not giving you
the HDR experience so at its advertised
keep an eye out for this type of thing
and it's a good thing that there are
people closely monitoring the specs
resolutions and features support of
products that are launched by a large
companies like Dell to make sure that
they are staying honest yeah all right I
have to pee
it's okay that's you let's switch to
swordfight all right we're gonna argue
about stuff and specifically here we're
gonna argue about the thread Ripper
retail packaging that you guys may or
may not be familiar with oh boy what
what drive it from packaging this is the
debate of the century right here yeah
kind of bits this is very serious stuff
all right well so here we go oh
anyone else kind of getting tired vibe
from the Andy res entire bag very tired
so I tweeted this yesterday okay so this
is the risin thread Ripper packaging on
the left side here yeah we already kind
of cover the Sun Kyle's who's that more
right you don't recognize that no really
it looks kind of familiar but I can't
pinpoint it
this Jurassic Park oh is that the egg no
it's a amber oh and it's a it's an
insect that trapped in the amber this is
the first Jurassic Park yeah at the
beginning of the first Jurassic Park
when they're going over like how this is
all working out and they talk about the
amber do you like these in them he's in
the amber body he pulls it out somehow I
have forgotten that very crucial part is
a foreign language okay no one I
remember yeah okay Hey look at it right
here so we have did you do this that's
image yeah yeah I put this side-by-side
you put a seven okay yeah that's my
tweet okay so we have the packaging
right here with a terrace it's also been
shown by by Lisa soo hold on Lisa super
scale let me go oh yeah here's a hex is
done and Lord it's the same picture it's
the same damn picture it's great picture
yeah there's a picture at Lisa sit yep
that's uh it's it's obviously reasonable
reasonably large size here I'm only
showing you this so you can see kind of
the actual thing it's it's curved around
the outside on the inside there is what
appears to be sort of illuminance going
on with the processor held internal yeah
I see it
so my question to people was like
obviously this is what I'm seeing out of
it and I asked a bunch of people like
what else they saw out of it so I got
lots of good responses which I thought
was pretty good a data a data even
through a nice like Wendell this was
what Wendell thought oh yeah okay so
he's not the only one
okay I'm sorry great Owen Owen said you
know how 9,000 so obviously we have
quite a few options here we had some
people said it looked like this old TV
this one I throw in there too reminds me
of the Animaniacs towheaded alien if
viewed from the front I just thought
that was unique so I threw that in there
as well so obviously there's Lisa sue
with it looks like a Macintosh an old
Mac or something like that we got we got
Indy here you know really no you know no
and he's good he's financed that's in I
don't know yeah so Indy Indy in Raiders
of the Lost Ark so here is what we're
gonna be arguing right now okay guys are
interested in chat and you want to argue
this along with us please feel free to
go and make a vote on that but what do
you think I'm obviously gonna go for the
first one okay
but Linda lettuce yeah dress pork intro
what do you think though I'm gonna say
how mines out as I was saying how nine
thousand from 2001 Space Odyssey it's a
classic clearly a basis of imitation
everyone's of course gonna try to copy
hell nine thousands that's like
god man thats all i got killed that
whole life yeah i killed the whole IPA
10.8% that you and it's good me with
function sir and I think that's a
drawing argument I'm so done I mean I
obviously argue for Jurassic Park
because yeah that's what I saw what I
saw when I saw the picture you know all
right that's awesome
any me wrecking my cell it's like what
wears those Jurassic Park reference but
you know that's just me
I just didn't just dumb it and get it
you didn't of the Jurassic Park thing I
don't doubt that that's very but see
let's compare it so this is the N cell
packaging for their core X series right
which is hideous did we ever have a
discussion about this no but it looks
horrible
it looks horrible it looks like they
went to a rave in there right it's there
it's straight forward it looks like a
real
bad rave decision yeah to give black out
with like neon colors like know for some
reason AMD with this I don't know what
it is about this part of it but it seems
like it's glowing or whatever so like
that makes it stand out more has a weird
sort of shimmery effect but I think that
like it just like the shape of it looks
so retro but we should also be pointing
out more practically speaking is a lot
of people pointing out the size of this
clearly seems to potentially indicate I
say clearly potentially potentially
indicates that there's a all-in-one
liquid cooler in there because that's
been one of the rumors I said it's I
don't know though I don't I don't think
it looks big enough baby and I mean I
mean it depends depends on what's going
on in there I don't know I I can't
from a business standpoint I can't
imagine AMD including like a 120
millimeter a IO with their CPU and
keeping the cost as low as it is as it's
been advertised so far I have a feeling
that they're just expecting enthusiasts
who buy their CPU to automatically
already have a - at least a 240
millimeter AO which I feel like it's
pretty reasonable I feel like most
people buying thread of her bed Ripper
probably either have preferred to have a
cue partition like you you probably
can't use any existing coolers on thread
well I'm saying like ones that become
available after thread after thread
Ripper launches like don't don't you
think that there are a few cooler
manufacturers out there who have already
been designing and and sort of planning
I think based on the TDP of thread
Ripper it's gonna require a good amount
of cooling but I also think any cooling
that goes onto thread Ripper is gonna
need to be completely new so I think it
would be practical to a certain degree
for them to do something good sorry do
something like that and ship a liquid
cooler with dread recur whether they
have two versions and others like this
here's here's this version for $1000 for
the thread referred 16 core that comes
with just the CPU here's this version
for $1,100 it comes with
CPU and a liquid cooler or something
like that I don't know I don't know how
they're gonna go about that but it does
seem like it's gonna need a pretty
substantial amount of cooling yeah but
let's get back to the main point which
is uh what does the thread refer retail
packaging remind you guys of and see
what people think definitely nothing
that could fit it 240 right I have
sahrin ever-watchful of top of great eye
lidless wreathed in flame I was gonna
add more there but I don't even has like
the appropriate but I did get second
place really no hana jurassic with the
Jurassic Park intro
it's a great light and then of course
third place see our team on TV or
monitor how then thousand came in pretty
low further down did have a few votes at
least for the Animaniacs option there
thanks to you guys for voting in our
survey and now let us move on to the
final segments of my half of the show
which is Q&amp;amp;A so we're gonna answer
questions have been asked most likely
via the donations that people have
submitted
you guys are awesome if you've been
sending estimation donations indeed
wonderful people
yeah where does Cal sap end and my half
begin question oh here we go Paul's
donations thank you so L heavy reviews
$5 donation says sup with those 4 XL
stay positive shirts Cal been waiting
for days yeah days bro now you got them
it's coming is it
soon soon very soon dude they're on
anyway 4x you just posted that yes like
now yeah
after after the live show at multi
testing during the live show I posted a
new video during my half of the live
show yes because it's what I'm holding
since three hours ago Paul ding it's a
31 minute video so it is a half an hour
it's a video for K know so what it takes
so long that's just how because because
I have a paid
YouTube channel Paul that I have to
upload
twice technically because because
everyone can access it business on your
page this is on big whit ultra this is
on the patreon channel as well as my
main channel all at the same time I have
to I had to upload three half-hour
videos to YouTube today at the same time
which is why after finishing the editing
of the video at like 12:00 noon
it's just now posting here it but it's a
great video it's a girl that's a great
hat of our video that you should all
watch right now about the new devotion
as soon as as soon as my half ends don't
use both half as an observer and you've
watched it your prayer and you party to
ever and you watch to ever we what we do
the written switch raid 2 as well 12 out
after all wait at least 12 hours before
you watch yeah ok just to make sure ah
Luke F again $5 donation value derp when
I asked you to bark twice why didn't you
say maybe you should check out bigger
and ultra do you even sell bro I think
I'll just miss a little bit ultra I
don't know what that means but I don't
know I remember that bark twice thing
but but I've been very diligent about
like pushing bit yeah videos like try
Coen $5 hey Paul not sure you saw my
Twitter message I would love to help you
work on your outdoor workbench I'm at
Chico Han on Twitter for contact chai I
will keep a very weather eye out for you
I'm sorry if I have missed you I get a
ton of people hitting me up on Twitter
and I try my best to keep up with it but
it's not always possible but I'll keep
an eye up because especially people
who've been offering help in that area
I'm very interested in indeed I hope I
can find you there
Scott Dilbeck another $6 in 66 cents ale
but enjoy your sushi ladies
Kyle I'm going to come edit myself into
pit maipi see you next week and leave
all right it's good that man won't take
any effort on our prints hot noodles 2 K
1 $10 donation bill my first PC based on
Paul RGB build
awesome 1080i or 1080p IOC blows OC
obviously if you have the option why not
but I'm glad you're able to build your
first PC build based on my heart you
need built VR it's awesome pup Shepard
five bucks Kyle what is your shirt size
PS Paul how is the Shepherd fit like
fairing PSS take a look at my channel
for my latest film noir toy
trailer the unsolved cases the unsolved
case the shepherd fairing I don't know
what you mean if you mean my dogs my
dogs are in pretty good shape it's
simple I freak out and start barking
Kyle your shirt size medium my meat
medium cows medium yes I may be small
movie Steven hill $20 thanks pop by the
way Steven hill $20 donation Thank You
Steven for that your half this time Paul
the IT guy at work is going on vacation
next week and I'm the most proficient
person I get to run the servers god help
us I would feel the same way when I was
in your situation i T the the finer
points of ITA are still lost on me David
Chao beauty channel animation the
Samsung gear VR headset is pretty cool
360 porn is really interesting I
honestly sit there and look around more
than I look at the model right now games
are fun too 360 porn though Wow
I mean that is a WoW that is a stellar
recommendation for the 3d porn at the
364 haven't tried that so just some we
have to look forward to I guess if
you're not already into it I sure yeah
good that's good door flop 69 $20 thank
you sir Paul do you remember the Foxconn
destroy your motherboard and how much
for autographs I don't typically charge
for autographs or at least I haven't in
the past the Foxconn destroy your
motherboard ooh I'd have to have to
delve into the archives to pull that up
Foxconn hasn't made direct motherboards
for quite some time they kind of pulled
out of that and I don't really recall
exactly when I do remember Foxconn
motherboards I don't remember the
destroyer specifically
would be curious to look that up though
Thank You dark logic just in 1633 $10
Paul get fidget Spooner so I can have
one from each of you side note I enjoy
watching this at work Paul I think
you've been called to officially launch
digit spinners on your store that is
three bottle caps which is not just a
spinner in any way the spinners but you
know it's it's the beginning of
something that could be great so I think
you should just hop on the bandwagon
with me thank you very much Tristan and
I said we get coder for $10 minute no
comment thank you very much coach Kota
Irish a coos - sir
for the five books is crossfire and SLI
going extinct good
Ubisoft hates supporting them it's
definitely been cut down from like
support for 3/4 way stuff - just - way I
think - way you'll see sticking around
for at least a while it's always been
spotty on support for it but I don't see
it going anywhere anytime soon it's just
an easy way for GPU manufacturers to be
able to say look now it's twice as fast
even though it's not quite that same way
all the way across the board but yeah
definitely a more limited support for it
than we saw we've seen in the past but
I'm still cool - way yeah I think that
makes sense no doubt Zack Salem $5
donation hey guys just got a million Li
Li PC a77 ever free oh yes you is it is
old and has a variation that has very
short cables new PSU or extensions
looking for the cheapest options thanks
so he's wondering if you get a new
pattern if you're looking for the
cheapest option then extensions might be
your best bet but also consider the
platform that you're on and consider
that any PSU that's prior to the has
well time time frame which is say
anything more than three four years old
might have more limitations when it
comes to the low-power states that
modern platforms can actually work with
so you might consider just upgrading
your PSU because if you have a very old
one it might just be at that time yeah
but thank you second witness Kay from
the fire
Canadian hey guys it's advertised that
Rison and thread ripper probably will
maybe support 4000 megahertz Fram know
of any sticks that actually work at
those speeds
uh yeah G scale has kits that are rated
for 4,000 speed I believe Corsair does
as well mmm
yeah it's just one of those things that
it's it's like they can have kits that
they know can be tested and work at that
speed but does this TPU that you are
using actually work at that speed as
well it just depends and it's luck of
the draw and yeah beyond the
manufacturer listed rated speeds which
for Intel this is like what 2666 and
yeah and and there abouts um yeah you
might you're not gonna get guaranteed
but I will say right now intel has
better support for higher speed memory
yeah it also partially depends on like
your motherboard BIOS and what they've a
lot of support for yeah but you should
be ok if you go with either Corsair or
g.skill for the most part I feel like
that's those are the best results that
I've seen so far but we've got SG man
shield from hindsight itching to build a
compact Red River build thinking at work
looking at making an ITX beast in early
2018 probably I would not expect to see
ITX thread Ripper unless you know at all
I have a feeling she's probably not
gonna exist x3n won't exist and then I
really don't know no it's huge the
socket is huge it is a massive socket
someone's gonna do it though and it's
maybe like maybe a toxin maybe a stock
will do one like they did with X 299
whatever which was also fairly
impractical or whatever yeah but you
you're not gonna have support for
quad-channel memory you're gonna lose
out on a lot of the stuff for the
platform yeah so the practicality of
making something that small with
something like the Red River it just
doesn't make as much sense true Rison
like you can make an ink core really
nice eight core resin CP system and
there's already a DX boards for that
yeah and you'll be fine there I just I
don't
see it happening on threader great yeah
my great TX probably I hope but I
wouldn't expect to see an ITX board for
thread Ripper at least not one that
doesn't make some really really serious
limitations on the overall capabilities
of the board no Joel bottle sita for the
$5 i was getting this wonderful stream
again live also one day a mirror will
pass under clark and it'll see itself
and that's the day we will have to mount
and then will it gather itself to be
recycled and then will it make more
clark robots that recycle other things
yes that's the that's what i assumed
question thank you very much sir title
all for the five bucks on your rise and
rebuild do you suggest adding more case
pans is it needed for a rising three
build probably no not as you know you're
dealing with less heat output due to
lower frequencies lower frequencies you
should be good
you probably don't and you probably need
like one or two case fans to be honest
and you'll be fine because they're just
not running it's quite asbestos speeds
as the higher and stuff matt bond five
bucks paul you magnificent bastard
enjoying IP on me
Kyle you're cool too I'll get you next
week thank you very much Matt we
appreciate so much Mac drew four to one
five dollars already started watching
Kyle's new video awesome also you think
of the high $800 buy-in to ambi thread
Ripper will kill the X 399 platform I
don't think so yeah I don't think so
right right now all they have to worry
about is competing against Intel and if
they can show that those CPUs are really
good value options as compared to
Intel's high-end desktop platform then
they'll be good I also think there's a
pretty good chance that they're going to
be releasing lower core count options as
well that are slightly more reasonable
so that like Intel there will be some
sort of more somewhat more
cost-effective option to buy into X 399
like I'd like to be able to get an X 399
platform with like a $400
CPU that's maybe a 10 core or
or something like that sure you know a
little bit better than what you get with
Rison but something that you can kind of
get on there and then maybe you've got
an option to upgrade it in the future or
something like that that's always been
something that's very useful but yeah
we'll see how things play out but for
now it seems like they're doing two CPUs
when they actually launch yeah
wifey sauce wifey sauce this is my wife
$5 this is my first donation I think you
deserve it more than my husband thanks
honey
that's awesome thanks a wifey sauce oh
yeah we can't wait to go home
if Heather if you're watching you should
you should come out and join us for
sushi yes you said speak it by tweeting
to finish that time Jay everyone we know
is really enjoy both channels Paul of
the nest Thank You way back how about an
update on how it's working for your
channel Kyle would love to hear about
your storage backup solutions thanks q
about the great content Jay I need to do
an update on my nest built because
basically the USB Drive that the NASS
operating systems running on failed then
I have not updated since then I can
rebuild the ZFS filesystem oh here oh
don't do that okay I can't rebuild the
ZFS filesystem with that but I actually
think I want to upgrade the base
platform on it soon so yeah I do have
some more stuff coming up on that very
soon all right we have some really quick
Johnston's to shout out oh my god I have
quite a few all right I'm gonna do these
quickly

is all that was army thank good lord
cut lord okay maybe thanks to all you
guys who have bought pigeon spinners I
apparently need to get fitted spinners
to things
