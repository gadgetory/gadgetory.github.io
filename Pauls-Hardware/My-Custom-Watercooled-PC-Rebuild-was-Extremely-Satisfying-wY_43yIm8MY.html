240 millimeter liquid CPU cooler
fermenter max with addressable RGB LEDs
allowing for unique lighting effects
from the two fans and the water block
the block also has a clear panel with a
flow indicator and there's an in-line
high efficiency ceramic bearing pump if
you're looking for a CPU cooling upgrade

the video description what's up guys
welcome back to Pauls hardware I am very
excited for today's video because this
entire mess of stuff right here that's
been cluttering my garage up for the
past three days or so is going to be
reinstalled into this case here we're
gonna bring arctic Panther back to life
but first I got to do a quick unboxing
I've been documenting this entire
process up till now so click the links
in the description if you want to check
out any of those videos but if you miss
those details and you don't want to go
watch here is a quick recap arctic
Panther first built about three years
ago
rebuilt about eight months ago the fluid
I used in the loop was from primo chill
it was called primo chill view I used an
early version of it and I let it stay in
there a bit too long so it got kind of
kicked up and clogged in the CPU and GPU
blocks as well as the rest of the
components so he took apart the CPU and
GPU blocks scrubbed them out with some
toothpaste at the end of last week and I
for this past weekend have been running
this loop right here with the mayhem
splits kit extra the blitz kit - and
this I have been adding water to and
actually draining I've done that about
four times over the course of this
weekend and then just let the fluid
cycle through there because that's what
you're supposed to do and that's to
clean out the radiators as well as the
pump and reservoir here this is on its
last cycle looping through so we're
gonna let this run for a little bit
longer going to scrub out all the
fittings and stuff so that they can be
reused and that's why we got these here
and of course gonna reassemble the CPU
and GPU blocks put that back in there
and finally bend some new tubes to
replace the tubes that I already have
because they're pretty filled with
residue and they don't look that great
so why are we doing that's pretty much
it let's get to work
alright guys first half of the day is
done and we have the blocks reassembled
they're all put back together everything
went together pretty pretty okay it
wasn't too difficult to get these going
but now we can move on to reinstalling
stuff in the case now first off I'm
upgrading the RGB LED in this system we
have addressable RGB LED strips one of
these was actually sent by a fan like
last year sometime probably a good seven
months ago so I think it might have been
robbed I apologize I forget who actually
sent these but thank you for sending
this whichever fan did I got a couple
more so I can make sure that we are
fully kitted out with our jeebies and
these are magnetic so I'm gonna put one
strip I think down the side and across
the bottom and then that will continue
across the bottom and up the opposite
side and then I have one extra strip and
I'll I'll see if I can fit that in there
somewhere if I can if not no big deal
but another upgrade I've actually been
meaning to do it to do with this system
is it has a 7 8 20 X in there which is
an 8 core 16 thread CPU for Intel's X
299 platform skylake X but they have
CPUs going up all the way to 18 cores on
this platform so I think I'm going to
jump from 8 cores to 16 so this is the
16 core 32 thread 79 60 X and I think
just to start to take things to the next
level I'm going to real quickly delayed
this processor so
you
it's time to fill the loop
okay guys as you can see arctic Panther
has been reassembled and good news upon
first fill there don't appear to be any
leaks I did rebend the tubes which
fairly smoothly but it has been a very
long day already so we're gonna cut the
video off here I will be doing a
follow-up video doing some actual
testing seeing what the 16-core does in
there showing some temperature numbers
and that kind of thing but for now it's
been a very long day of working so if
you enjoyed this video definitely at the
thumbs up button thumbs up if you
enjoyed noticing my Star Wars mandate
that I've been wearing all day had to
replace it but anyway thank you guys so
much for watching this video of course
and subscribe to Fiona some more just
like it we'll see you guys in the next
video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
