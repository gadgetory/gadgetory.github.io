weird what Antec wanted to send me a new
80 plus gold rated power supply because
they already have a gold rated power
supply series called true power the
Antec Edge series for today's video does
differentiate from the true power series
in several ways that I appreciate it but
most notably the edge features near
silent operation thanks to its one
hundred thirty-five millimeter fluid
dynamic varying fan the edge series is
available in 550 watt 650 watt and 750
watt variants and all are 80 plus gold
rated for up to 92%
efficiency all of them are also fully
modular meaning that all cables can be
unplugged from the power supply an tech
is standing behind these units with a
five-year warranty and inside the box
you'll find paperwork for that warranty
a user guide for silver mounting screws
AC power cable and an tech bag for
unused modular cables and for vibration
dampers two red and two black that can
be fitted over the end of the power
supply for a blast of color or more
practically to kill vibration I'm not a
huge fan of these to be honest but if
your case doesn't have soft mounts for
your power supply it could come in handy
I do like that an tech provided red and
black though so speaking of which now is
a good time to talk about aesthetics I
thought an tech actually did a really
great job on the edge series visually
allowing it to blend in or stand out
depending on your preference it has a
very clean black anti scratch finish and
hex grilling covering three of the sides
which provides excellent airflow but it
also creates a very cool lighting effect
when the white LED fan is on thankfully
though if a white LED doesn't fit in
with your aesthetic and tech has
dedicated a switch on the unit to turn
off the light this attention to detail
could also be seen with the modular
cables which are 100% black a very nice
touch when you consider how visible
cabling can be in a windowed computer
case speaking of modular cables for the
650 watt model I up here you get a total
of nine SATA power plugs six molex and
one floppy for peripherals for six plus
two pin PCI Express graphics connectors
a four plus four pin CPU connector and
the 24 pin main motherboard connector
this is a 650 watt PSU and that's
continuous power not peak power it
should be noted this PSU is also oh my
see sonic which should me
excellent internal component choices and
build quality it is built on 235 amp
12-volt rails but all the modular
connectors on the back are labeled so
you know which one you're going to be
pulling power from a quick aside here
guys I'm actually not fully qualified to
review the performance internals and
build quality of power supplies but I do
recommend websites like Johnny guru and
tech power up who have the proper
knowledge and testing equipment to do so
testing equipment being very important
they're an antique has taken a gander at
the edge series recently so check out
that link to the article in this video's
description for more information
to sum up they said the build quality is
excellent and quote perhaps the most
well-made sub 700 watt unit that they
have seen to date very high praise I did
do some testing on my own by using this
unit to power my test bed at Quora 750
960 x EVGA x99 classified motherboard
and 16 gigabytes of g.skill ddr4 memory
as well as an EVGA GTX 970 at stock
under full load running Ida 64 stress
test and Unigine valley power drop
peaked at about 340 watts with the CPU
overclock to 4.5 gigahertz and the GPU
at 1500 same tests peaked at about 440
watts and without a hiccup from the edge
650 so it did a great job there I only
came up with two negatives to mention
with regard to this PSU one of them was
the length at 170 millimeters long there
are shorter power supplies out there
with the same wattage compatibility and
some smaller form factor cases might be
an issue so bear that in mind I think
this is meant to allow for the larger
fan of course and for greater airflow
though kind of in keeping with the focus
on silent operation with the edge series
so I guess it's understandable I also
feel like these units could benefit from
some sale pricing as this model retails
for about 130 dollars right now which
isn't really the most competitive given
the other comparable PSU options that
are out there on the plus side though
you have all of the aesthetic qualities
that I mentioned earlier
power supplies don't always have that
sex appeal going for them but I like
that you can opt for subtlety or bling
with the edge I should also mention that
this is the most quiet power supply I
have used outside of fanless passively
cooled models so it definitely lives up
to the hype there if you've heard me say
don't skimp on the power supply before
and you want
take that advice for your next mid-range
build I think the edge is an excellent
choice antek has challenged me actually
to build a completely silent system
around this power supply and some other
Antec products including the p100
chassis so let me know if you guys have
any suggestions for that bill because
I'd love to hear your ideas and how I
can make it a little bit more unique
don't forget to like and share this
video too it helps out a lot thank you
so much for watching guys we'll see you
all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
