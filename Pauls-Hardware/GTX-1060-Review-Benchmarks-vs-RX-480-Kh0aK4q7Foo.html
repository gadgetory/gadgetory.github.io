it's built for mini ITX water-cooled
systems just like this one but watch out
if you get one Josh might just show up
or your house randomly fractal design to
find Nano as is small quiet and built
for mini ITX water-cooled systems just
like this one but if you get one watch
out because frankly josh might just show
up at any minute
note Kyle's full of oh well I was
immersive and pulse still Nigeria we've
been here for like an hour
dudes get the hell outta here the NVIDIA
GeForce GTX 1060 has launched this is
the founders Edition which you can buy
for $300 MSRP or we are told that there
will also be two hundred and fifty
dollar MSRP third-party designs but
let's be honest we're told that with the
GTX 1080 and 1070 as well so full may
wants Nvidia shame that's a shame
anyway though the questions I have for
this card are how does it compare to the
rx 480 recently launched by AMD Radeon
will any of these cards actually sell
for $250 or will they all be priced
closer to the $300 founders Edition and
is this shroud supposed to look like the
Millennium Falcon or Batman or Optimus
Prime maybe like a cyber pac-man okay so
people usually love or hate the
reference card design or founders
Edition as they are now called by Nvidia
personally though I think this one
actually looks pretty nice consider that
at a lower price you'll often get a less
impressive cooler on third-party design
graphics cards so this being a dual slot
closed design cooler with a blower style
fan green LED lit GeForce GTX logo and
having a black and silver shroud made of
cast aluminum gives it a pretty nice
premium feel so perhaps more of a
relative value here than with the 1080
and 1070 founders editions that have to
go up against the very highest and
third-party designs there is no
backplate unfortunately that will
definitely be a value add for custom
third party cards PCB itself is just shy
of 7 inches long about 175 millimeters
so we've already been seeing really tiny
versions of this card from third-party
board manufactures with the shroud and
the blower it's just under 10 inches
long total about 250 millimeters a 6-pin
PCI Express power connector is located
at the end of the shroud rather than
where the PCB ends which is actually
pretty nice for cable management and an
unobstructed view of the geforce gtx
logo and nvidia says this card has a 120
watt TDP at the heart of the card is the
new Pascal GPU the GP 106 little brother
to the GP 104 used in the 1080 and 1070
it's still 16 nanometer Pascal
architecture though with 4.4 billion
transistors paired with six gigabytes
192 bit gddr5 memory at 8000 megahertz
effective clock speed 10 streaming multi
processors 1280 CUDA cores 80 texture
units hundred and ninety-two gigabytes
per second of memory bandwidth and 48
ROPS round out the specs since this is a
Pascal GPU you also get to take
advantage of new Pascal technologies
including simultaneous multi-project for
more on those check out my GT X 1080
intro video which I'll link right up
there
no SLI bridge on this card means no
traditional SLI support not even two-way
which I'm kind of on the fence about I
never really recommended two-way SLI
configs in the past with sixty series
cards like the GTX 660 or 960 but I
don't like having options removed from
the consumer either you could still use
direct x12 Lda explicit mode to pair up
a couple of 10 60s or MDA mode to add
other non 1060 or non Nvidia cards even
with multi adapter but that would also
require a well-designed DirectX 12 title
it properly leverages and balances
multi-gpu usage which in my opinion just
doesn't really exist right now
anyway though I will be discussing
DirectX 12 and Vulcan more in depth in
another video once the dust from this
launch settles video outs are three
DisplayPort 1.4 s1 HDMI 2.0 B and one
DVI just like the 1080 and 1070 on to
overclocking though my founders edition
card had a lot of overclocking Headroom
so expect to see some nicely factory
overclocked third-party designs
I used EVGA precision X and I ended up
tacking 190 megahertz onto the GPU clock
250 megahertz onto the memory clock with
power temp and voltage sliders maxed out
at stock the card has a base clock of
1506 boost of 1709 max of 1911 and an
average of 1835 with the overclock that
jumped up to 1680 one base 18
for boost 2075 Max and 2037 megahertz
average speed under full gaming load
temperatures were pretty reasonable with
the founder's edition 1060 if you
compare it to the founders edition 1080
or 1070 it hits 72 degrees Celsius at
stock with fan speed ranging from 30 to
50 percent with the overclock I set the
fan manually to 70% and it hits 75
degrees Celsius max under load here's
fan noise testing so you can hear for
yourself we're going to start off at
idle here's 40 percent fan speed typical
at stock settings while gaming
here's 70 percent which is what I had it
set to while I was overclocking and
here's 100 percent which you can use to
annoy your roommates moving on to
benchmarks I tested at 1920 by 1080 and
2560 by 1440 and since it is always
controversial whether or not I use
overclocked numbers I have both stock
and overclocked numbers for the gtx 1060
as well as the RX for 80 AMD Radeon
closest competing card I also reached
the GTX 970 so you can compare in videos
former best card in this range and here
are my results
so clearly the GTX 1060 is faster than
the RX 480
but it also costs more there's also the
DirectX 12 and Vulcan questions to be
answered as these new AP eyes have
asynchronous compute support which
Nvidia still lacks hardware acceleration
for I wanted to focus today's video more
on currently playable titles however so
I will be following up in the future
with a dedicated video to DirectX 12
Vulcan an asynchronous compute hopefully
with more info and further developments
in that area finally some power draw
results and please take these with a
grain of salt as I'm recording peak
wattage which isn't always consistent
remember also that TDP which is 120
watts for the GTX 1060 150 watts for the
R X 480 refers to how much heat needs to
be dissipated by the cooler not how much
power the card actually draws so I think
what I'm actually going to do for anyone
who wants more info on the power draw at
least is link to the inevitable PC
perspective review down below because
they have much better power draw testing
equipment than I do so check that down
in the description ok its conclusion
time once again and I think we can sum
up the GTX 1060 thusly and video knows
how this card performs so they've priced
it accordingly to be more accurate it's
about 5 to 20 percent faster than an Rx
480 depending on the test in the
settings of course and for $300 it's 25%
more expensive than the 240 dollar 8 gig
version of the RX 480 so again NVIDIA
has the faster option AMD Radeon appears
to have the better cost to performance
card if you're upgrading yes this is a
very nice step up from the GTX 970 for a
lower price if you're considering the
1060 versus the 480 right now I think it
just comes down to budget and we're
going to have to wait to see if in the
coming months advances in DirectX 12 and
Vulcan titles show Radeon gaining a
significant edge in async compute
performance or if the 8 gig of Ursa 6
queued for gig frame buffer has an
impact at higher resolutions but
basically if you're so going to spend
200 to 250 dollars get the RX 480 we're
going to spend 250 to 300 get the 1060
lastly pricing and availability are
important those were issues with 1070
and 1080 launches so I'm going to be
keeping an eye on a video stock levels
for this card after lunch and I think
pricing criticism is well warranted -
with the new and more expensive founders
Edition versus the old style of creating
a reference design that actually sells
for the base price I for one I'm not
going to be talking about a 250 dollar
gtx 1060 until i actually see one for
sale and in stock
somewhere since the $600 GTA X 1080 MSRP
still seems to be kind of a mythical
unicorn that you only hear about it
legends of PC gaming past
I love to hear what you guys think of
this card though so leave me your
comments in the comment section down
below do you guys like this Founders
edition design for the GTX 1060 are you
all going to be waiting for a DIN board
