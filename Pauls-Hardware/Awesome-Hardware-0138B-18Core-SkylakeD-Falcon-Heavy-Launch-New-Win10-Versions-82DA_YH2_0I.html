right now we're probably probably live
like right now hi
so hello we should we should introduce
ourselves so we should let people know
what the heck is going on if they're
watching this I am this is Kyle
and I'm Paul yes sorry it looks like
we're like all hi everyone welcome to
awesome hard work how thank you for
being here this is a live show about
technology that we stream every Tuesday
evening at about 5:30 p.m. Pacific time
we stream it in two halves and the first
half of today's show which is episode
number 138 we've been doing this for a
long time if you old was already
streamed to Kyle's YouTube channel which
is called bit wit and you can find the
link to that in this video's description
if you didn't watch that then you
probably haven't seen us having a few
drinks and talking about Bitcoin and and
and other stuff and I was drinking beer
was with us everyone it was it was it
was awesome it's really good can so
check that out first
that will give you a better idea of what
we have done to get up to this point
which is have a few drinks Cheers if you
guys want to have a drink along with us
and you're of age and you're drinking
responsibly please go ahead and do so at
the same time now a quick word of
warning we do occasionally use foul
language on the show it really did
spoils
and I guess a few fun but it is what we
like to hear right yeah that cow was
gonna spoil everything they talked about
fun which is what we have on this show
we have lots of fun then we talked about
technology word that's the basic idea so
thanks to you guys for joining us and
Cheers
and right now we are currently drinking
this yeah this beer that cow got us
which is from ballast point eagerly yep
see it is victory at sea for coffee I
didn't realize you had so much left and
vanilla yeah you never finished yours I
didn't realize I had so much luck it's
probably why is because you never poured
the rest of yours all right I'm gonna
I'm gonna kill I'm gonna kill this first
then cheers Cheers have lots of beard
finish famous indeed you do release it's
delicious all right if you're not
impressed already know if you are
impressed then maybe you want to spend
money on us I guess is what I'm trying
to say paul sartre net is my store and
you can buy some merch over there it's
got my logo on it it's all really hot
really high-quality stuff so check it
out we got mugs pint glasses shirts
bottle opener made of stainless steel
which you can use to cut people and
defend yourself and the event of the
home invasion
big wig tech slash stores cows store and
if you guys happen to buy stuff during
the show while we're live at the end of
each half we will shout your name out
and yell Johnson and at least give you
some amount of thanks for for helping
support us yeah the Johnsons are really
the spiritual spiritual it's a yeah it's
very it's a deeply spiritual thing it's
a long tradition that we that we honor
here and speaking of long traditions the
second half of the show
typically continues the tech news
section segment Sega so let's continue
to doc talk about some tech news section
segment Tomatoes metal and specifically
sky like D here's an article about
skylight D over on a man's tech and if
you guys aren't familiar with skylight D
it's as described by Ian who wrote this
article dr. Ian Contras its
so tarik like the dizzy on deal I yeah
it's it's not bad for very long all
about the be the first gens Ian deep
right parts were based on Brad well
which is just for just a couple years
old now and had up to 16 cores supported
ECC memory up 228 gigabytes of ECC
memory as well as 10 a kick a 10 G base
T networking on a single chip that's
drew less than 45 watts or had less than
a 45 watt TDP so basically you're
looking at an SOC that has a pretty good
amount of functionality integrated into
it it's a CO an SOC it's and this is
part of the Z online so there's not
necessarily something that you would buy
to integrate into a gaming a little bit
more enterprise or just perhaps a little
bit more specific to some use case
scenarios servers and especially nast
devices that are a little bit more
high-end that might require higher core
counts to that kind of thing in order to
handle a more significant amount of
amount of drives that kind of thing is
what this is kind of designed for while
maintaining a pretty reasonable level of
price I'm sorry of performance to power
drop ok fairly efficient performance per
watt yet so used for networking storage
management's dense server installations
and basically there's a bit of deduction
that was done by by mr. Ian caches here
in this article in order to derive from
some information actually listed
directly from Intel and they have
something called in a they they have
price lists that they publish and they
typically update weekly or at least
every other week and they were waiting
for some updates to come in January the
update wasn't posted until the very end
of January so January 31st was when
Intel actually posted this price list
updates and it may even have been
accidental because it listed these CPUs
before most of the tech journal before
tech journalists really got ahold of it
in order to speak on it a little bit
more than that so here are the xeon d
2018 processors that were listed the
xeon d 2191
the 2161 i and yes if you're looking at
these numbers that is an uppercase i
that intel has decided to put on the end
of a product name nevermind that they
already have like AI base project
lowercase nevermind potential confusions
between a one and a number ll i or a
lowercase L terrible marketing yeah
Ian specifically says in this article
like his name starts with an eye and he
regularly gets stuff delivered to him
laying it's not something that you would
you would really aim for I guess if
you're trying to market something and at
least make it discoverable or no we're
not confusing but anyway all that said
we go to Intel acquire lammle recently I
don't know maybe in telemarketing and
naming schemes especially for CPUs is
often very confusing but all that said
these are fairly impressive it's at
least the corer and turn turn count the
high-end xeon d 2191 has 18 cores and 36
threads 1.6 here it's base frequency
twenty four point seven five megabytes
of l3 cache at 86 watt TDP and a steep
steep price of two thousand four hundred
and six dollars so obviously this is an
enterprise level product that probably
most people aren't going to be that
interested in but never mind all that
it's can be purchased as a CPU
integrated onto a motherboard even a
mini ITX motherboard so in a fairly
small footprint you can get a pretty
decent amount of processing power at a
pretty reasonable TDP as well now the
TDP is actually listed here are
relatively high if you compare it to the
original the first run line of xeon d
that starts with 1000 so the 1000 series
so there is also some speculation in the
article as to how much of an action
we'll say performance four o'clock
improvement we're getting here with this
new lineup that's been leaked compared
to the existing lineup is it really just
that they're increasing core counts and
and also sick when it is sort of in the
same sequential vein increasing the
price or are we going to get a little
bit more than that the second and third
CPU I'm sorry I know the price list
specifically here that Intel leaks
doesn't say skylight D the product list
update though that Super Micro published
because Super Micro makes lots of server
motherboards they published a list and
that held some information about xeon d
skews that are listed right here and
then Ian took that information as well
as some additional information listed
elsewhere from Super Micro and combined
it in order to make this list of
purported xeon d skews going from 8 to
12 to 16 to 18 cores again some of these
are sort of speculated in between so
they don't all have the same i'll have
the frequency and cache numbers listed
as well as TDP so zod are the full
desktop CPUs Kiley these are integrated
to associate sky like do you like D
would refer to the architecture is the
anthea refer to the actual product line
okay yeah so it's it's kinda like
architecture integrated into the C and D
product gotcha
there's two new super micro motherboards
the x11 SD v8 c TL n to gene and the x11
SVP - for C - TL n 2 F again they
acquired Lee and Lee I know both the
mini ATX motherboards with skylake DSO
C's integrated onto them support for 512
gigs of lrdimms
ddr4 2666 dual 10 gigabit base teeth and
networking and all of these appear to be
pretty impressive products for specific
meet a specific niche of computing needs
maybe not necessarily those of you who
are going out to build a gaming PC right
now right but I could imagine server
that on the lower end of this if you're
running a server farm or
if you're just looking for something
that's that crazy expensive when it
comes to enterprise pricing but has
everything integrated onto a single
low-power platform might be a viable
option for you I suppose
anyway what's cool and there's of course
more detail and the article from an
antic which is liked in this video
subscription if you guys want to check
it out and read a little bit more noise
let's move on to Windows 10 and Windows
10 actually announcing well basically
they're changing their roadmap that they
have kind of talked about in the past
and especially the consumer SKUs for
Windows 10 this article is on Seurat
comm and they apparently saw some
internal Microsoft documents about this
Microsoft is working on ten I'm sorry on
five new Windows 10 SKUs SKU if you're
not familiar stands for stock keeping it
so those 10 SKUs like 10 different
operating versions different versions of
Windows 10 basically okay and these are
for different hardware configurations so
there's an entry level hardware
configuration for Intel Atom Celeron
Pentium processors that have less than
or equal to four gigs of RAM as well as
very limited storage less than or equal
to the 32 gig SSD as well as a very
small screen size so less than fourteen
point one inches so you're talking about
a super portable here those will be
eligible for entry-level Windows 10
value level is the next step up for that
you might have an Intel Atom Adam
Celeron and Pentium CPU less than or
equal to four gigs of ram maybe a little
bit more storage up to 64 gigs and about
the same screen size also still an ultra
portable but all this is to say these
are five different levels of hardware
core hardware requirements is basically
in between the value requirement and the
core Plus requirements core plus
requires a high end quote unquote CPU
and more than four gigs of ram and more
than or equal to eight gigs of ram plus
of 1080 screen resolution this is video
Ram I'm guessing it's not really made
specific but basically they're tearing
these different versions based on the
hardware that's integrated and please
please please bear in mind we're talking
about om pricing here
om pricing for Windows 10 so this is
book pricing or companies that do system
integration or OEM system builds will
now have access to an entry-level
version of Windows 10 for $25 a value
level version of Windows 10 for $45 a
core version of Windows 10 for 65
dollars and 45 cents a core plus version
of Windows 10 for $86 and 66 cents and
an advanced version of Windows 10 for
101 dollars so from an end users
perspective does this mean if you were
buying a low powered pre-built for
example that you would have to pay less
money on the operating system because
it's been tiered as a lower version of
Windows 10 there's like then the lowest
the entry level SKU which costs less
yeah probably the SI and the end user so
so what I'm getting yes so what Windows
is doing here with OEMs is they're
basically saying if you're billing if
you're building out a really low power
system or a very inexpensive system that
has fairly minimum system specs and you
want to put Windows 10 on it you can do
so for a much lower price the entry
price $25 much less than the sake or
plus price of 86 dollars and sixty six
cents so this will allow low power entry
level more budget oriented say laptops
or desktops to ship with Windows 10 for
a more reasonable price whereas options
for system integrators prior to this
would be paid more for Windows 10 or try
and other options such as making your
Chromebook with Chrome OS or making
Linux making that yeah some making
something based on Android or something
like that so it seems like it's
providing Windows 10 with a little bit
more flexibility when it comes to the
different prices
it's still not completely clear to me
from reading the article as well as a
follow-up article how this would affect
like you said home users like are you
gonna be able to distinguish between
your value Edition of Windows 10 that
came with your $500 laptop from the core
plus version of red O's tant 10 that
came right to your $1200 desktop yeah
it doesn't seem like functionality is
affected so much as this is a pricing
scheme that's that's separated so that
om system builders can have more options
for providing Windows with the system's
while not having to deal with quite as
much of an upfront cost so then we won't
have to worry about let's say you have a
high-end system that shipped with like
the top tier of Windows 10 and a low-end
system on the same local network having
communication issues because they're
shipping with two different tiers of
Windows that should never be an issue an
issue unless you're talking about
specifically the pro version versus non
pro pro typically has been and according
to the article we'll still continue to
have support for domain access as well
as the other professional level
connectivity and security features that
come with brow versus the home versions
Windows 10 S is also apparently now dead
but there will be a Windows 10 S mode
for each of these different versions of
Windows 10 and if you're not familiar
with Windows 10 s it is basically a
limited version of Windows 10 that will
only allow you to run for example the
Windows Store apps right so it's limited
but still functional operating system
but I don't know windows that Microsoft
Microsoft isn't saying that that was a
failure but they are ending it so I
don't know I don't know
I never really dabbled much with Windows
10 s I was mainly dealing with the full
versions of the operating system so I'm
not sure what people's experiences with
that I'm just still a little confused
like if the pricing is different based
on what level of hardware you have what
difference is there in the actual
operating system it doesn't seem like
there is much difference in the actual
operating system and this is the price
that that Microsoft would charge the OEM
I see the system integrator huh so that
the OEM could charge you a more
competitive pricing that there's like
less overhead for their whole system
when you buy the system you okay might
not necessarily like I don't know I
don't know if there's gonna be labels
that you have Windows core right for
your system yeah or whether this is just
something that's purely gonna be a
between Microsoft and the OEM thing and
then when you get the operating when you
get here you just have Windows 10 right
and that's all you have yeah I feel like
from micro spot Microsoft's perspective
that would be that would make more sense
right because splitting things up like
this has never been much of a good idea
in my experience because it's confusing
to people right different versions of
different prices and different features
and everything like that yeah but I
guess if you're if you're currently
using Windows 10s you should keep in
mind that Windows 10s is now dead mmm
there is now the windows 10s mode and
that each of these versions will have
the opportunity to that Windows 10 s
mode so you can have maybe an even
cheaper laptop that you get that has
Windows 10s yeah but whereas prior to
now there have been options to upgrade
windows 10s to full version the full
version of windows free of charge
they're now saying there will be a $49
charge for pro s users to switch to the
full version of Windows 10 Pro this is
maybe just in the prosign again the
articles like the description if you
guys want to read it because as far as
details go this is pretty much all I've
got for you right now
I will try to keep an eye on this I
guess in the upcoming weeks to determine
what people's experiences with it or
whatever but I hope what the what the
ultimate upshot of this is is that
people who are buying low costs laptops
or or that kind of thing can get them
for cheap and still have Windows 10 if
that's what they want
okay let's move on charter how many of
you guys have charter how many guys want
faster Internet
then if you have charter and you want
faster Internet's we have good news and
we have bad news the good news is that
charters cable network which reaches 50
million homes and businesses in the US
with about 40 million of those being
homes or residences nearly all of them
should be able to buy gigabit speed
cable internet connection
from charter by the end of 2018 so
within the next 11 to 12 months if you
don't already have access to superfast
gigabit internets and your charter
subscriber you should have access to
that the upgrades will require some
modem transfers so maybe you might have
to swap out your modem for a higher-end
one or something like that the bad news
is gigabits according to Charter is 940
megabits per second down and 35 megabits
per second up I get higher than that
right now with my Time Warner
subscription and I'm paying less than
105 a month thirty five megabits per
second a hundred up is really I mean
it's not bad that's not a bad uplink but
when you compare it to the downlink of
nine and 40 it's pretty dirty so they're
targeting the mainstream yeah it doesn't
really need an uplink so don't really
need upstream so if your main goal with
your internet connection is to stream 4k
video from your favorite video streaming
services this is a good option for you I
mean you don't need this much bandwidth
to stream 4k video I should be clear
that yeah but extra Headroom whatever
got lots of room to download stuff you
be multifaceted whatever you're doing of
the things right ask download all the
videos whatever uplink though 35
megabits per second perfectly adequate
for most streamers and that kind of
thing but just not quite symmetrical so
if you're thinking about you want to
download a bunch of stuff that you also
want to upload upload your you know you
want to be a game streamer and upload at
4k 60 everybody had bitrate or something
like that just you're a gamer you're a
hardcore game I mean you're a hardcore
gamer with other people in the house
that are also maybe there they're all
saving inflatable gamers if your whole
family is streaming maybe you're a
professional eSports teeth streaming and
you think is clearly not gonna be
sufficient so you should probably
they're possibly greater options out
there okay pricing here is not super
competitive but not absurd 105 to 125
dollars is what they are those things
just met yeah we're this connection
charter if in case you're wondering well
what are the what are they gonna cap me
at you know are they gonna get a you
know 250 gigs for for free and then
they're gonna start throttling me or
something like that charter is actually
prohibited from selling plans with data
caps and overage fees until 2023 thanks
to merger conditions imposed on it on on
it in 2016 when they purchased Time
Warner Cable before a Jeep I came in the
mix yeah
so Charter agreed to this restriction no
data caps so this are you're at least
safe until 2023
if you happen to sign up for this plan
when it comes to date data caps after
that who knows a lot to see what happens
with the FCC and local local governments
and cities and states making their own
legislation and stuff like that but if
you want to comparison to this Google
Google Fiber which provides symmetrical
gigabits or 1000 megabit per second up
and down is $70 a month but you have to
be lucky enough to live in many other
places where that was deployed such as
Kansas and a couple of
municipalities like the Maduro comcast
which is a little bit more widespread
but you do have to have access of course
they have gigabit cable for 105 dollars
a month after an introductory for youth
$90 a month for the first 12 months I
hate those cable plans okay your plan is
only this many dollars for give us this
much for the first year for the first
six months like what happens after that
well then for five years you have to pay
yeah five years you Joe us your first
bunch at first one child and any crops
they raised on your land because people
are stupid and fall for it too - that's
why they're able to get away with it
always fully understand that but anyway
for anyone who really needed more
bandwidth
I guess bringing more bandwidth to more
people is a good thing
all right here is a digit Times article
about Simon semiconductor sales they had
a record in 2017 Ford and 12 billion US
dollars in semiconductor sales in 2017
this is according to the semiconductor
industry association or SI a yes or ebay
digit times semiconductor industry
posted sales so lean forward and solve
point two billion US dollars in 2017
this is the industry's highest ever
annual sales it's an increase of twenty
one point six percent compared to 2016
and December 2017 just the month of
December reached 38 billion in sales
that's an increase of twenty two point
five percent over the December 2016
numbers Wow semiconductors are used in
lots of products they used everywhere
they increasingly used more and more
often which is why we're seeing a lot of
these increased numbers which is also I
believe why we're seeing more scarcity
when it comes to certain componentry
and availability and fab availability
when it comes to specific parts that we
have maybe grown accustomed to be more
available and on a PC building side but
yeah as semiconductors have become more
heavily embedded in an ever-increasing
number of products from cars to coffee
makers and nation tech nation to come
technologies like artificial
intelligence virtual reality and the
Internet of Things have emerged global
demand for some
conductors has increased memory was the
largest semiconductor category by sales
in the US I'm sorry globally with us
evidence globally without in 24 billion
US dollars in sales in 2017 and also the
fastest growing with sales increasing
61.5% so my first response to that
number was lots of sales and US dollars
numbers but does that just mean it's
because you're charging twice as much
for memory in 2017 is he worth 2016 no
even with the increased prices increased
prices that we saw last year 61 point
five percent increase in sales Wow of
memory within the memory category says
the DRAM products increased 76% sales of
NAND flash products to increase 47% and
the the article has breakdowns of each
region and increases and basically was
global this is a mining has a lot to do
with this I think it's mining but it's
just it's the globalization of
technology it's it's higher-end
technology being more accessible on
scale so you're seeing more of a master
distribution to areas other than say
North America and Europe which is
traditionally had a little bit more
buying power but yeah yeah I guess it's
and and as mentioned at the beginning at
the beginning of the article lots of
other products that you might not like a
computer is a computer but a computer
that's integrated into something else is
now a thing and it's a thing in lots of
different applications so yeah
embedded products cars coffee makers
Internet of Things all require a system
on a little SOC needs a processor
probably need some memory need some
silicon in there all that stuff costs
money all that stuff has finite sources
from it so the more
products that are being made from those
base products from those bastes
materials the the more spirits that
become the more expensive everything
that becomes an adapter that can
translate you know coffeemaker memory
into like DVR for it would be a lot
cheaper running on coffee see that's why
people watch the show companies for
fruit for ideas like able insight I'm
totally speaking brilliant ideas silicon
wafers silicon wafer makers according to
this article from KITT guru are gonna
increase their prices by about 20
percent in 2018 and definitely PC
components would be affected as part of
that we actually kind of talked about
this a couple months back in November
some Co is the company that makes more
than 60% of the silicon wafers globally
and they plans Jane freeze their prices
by 20% and we talked about that a few
months back and how it might impact the
overall prices of components that
require silicon this article is more
specifically about Taiwan's global
wafers which is also I believe that the
number two manufacturer of silicon
wafers but I could be wrong about that
don't quote me but as I do want to point
out a comment in the article by Jason of
Angelou down here that global wafers was
never actually specifically quoted as
increasing their price by 20% but
according to the article that seems to
be the gist of it global wafers is like
hey this is sort of an industry thing
we're seeing prices increase they didn't
specifically say we're planning to
increase our prices by 20% right but it
does seem to be an industry-wide thing
bear in mind we're talking about silicon
wafers that is a part of a processor an
SSC or GP or something like that not
everything that goes on to it so you're
talking about a price increase for a
specific elements that goes into the
production of something like that right
so it is not necessarily something that
you wouldn't expect to see a linear
price increase right
but given that we've seen like a
doubling or tripling of GPU price
increases just in the past couple weeks
you know we'll have to see how this
actually turns out the biggest reason
for the price increase according to the
article is a shortage of 12-inch 300
millimeter wafers which are
traditionally used to build processors
graphics chips and RAM this price
increase will affect CPU GPU DRAM and
flash products interesting but again
that silicon wafer is only one part of
each of those components and those
components are also integrated into
other products such as full graphics
cards and that kind of things so wants
to see how it actually trickles down and
plays out some Co the company that
manufactures more than 60% of silicon
wafers estimated that global wafer
demands will rise to 6.6 million per
month by 2020 so they're not necessarily
seeing a easing of the demand for their
product which would mean basically that
they're no plans to drop the prices any
time soon
and we'll hopefully hopefully you
weren't planning to build a gaming PC
any time soon guys I don't know the news
when it comes to like an easing of
prices in the two main components that
are overpriced right now which is memory
and graphics cards I can't I don't know
if anyone can do I have heard that they
are switching back over to increasing
DRAM production and output from the fabs
which might use prices up but I've also
heard other you know you hear from both
sides what was the guy's name in the
article I was talking about in my half
torque toriel or Turk no sorry guys
yeah AMD I was saying basically and I
quote like like we cannot do anything
about the GPU shortage right now which
he was insinuating that the pricing that
you see now is probably gonna carry
through till the end of
team because GP manufacturers if they
had the supply they would dump it on the
retailers and prices would drop but they
can't do anything apparently because
there there are like they released these
products like a year or two ago like
nvidia for example released the gtx ten
series starting like two years ago now
like they're done they're on to the next
one so they're not gonna pump out more
cards to lower the prices and to make
them more affordable so like we have to
pray and hope that you know the eleven
hundred series cards of whatever volta
whatever it is the next generation has
more supply but I still feel like that's
been in such early development over the
last couple of years that like Nvidia
may have you didn't account for this
crypto phenomenon two years ago when
they started manufacturing these chips
and so like they could respond right now
by cranking up their output of
everything they could be like all right
everyone wants GPUs let's let's let's
produce the shit out of GPUs they could
if they wanted to increase their output
but the flipside to that would be if
suddenly crypto tanks and demand for the
for this these GPUs which is banovic
huge outsized suddenly goes away then
suddenly they have a surplus insanely
they can't sell their processors so yeah
running a business I mean and and you
guys are free to respond to that however
you might want to you might say like you
know what it doesn't matter for them
they should they should produce more
GPUs anyway because they're their
loyalties to the gamers and they should
be producing GPU so the gamers can buy
GPUs at reasonable prices you know
that's not like an absurd thing to say
you can argue that yeah
but the manufacturers perspective comes
from this a bit more fiscally
conservative point of view which is that
if they suddenly ramped up their
production then they might flood the
market and devalue their product and
then that becomes a big problem for them
when it comes to solvency and
how much money they're making later this
year or next year so do you think the
next generation of GPUs will have
because you knew you already have like
the 4k ready the VR ready badges on all
of our GPU products do you think the
next generation of VP is from both team
red and green will have like a a mining
ready badge on it or like a Bitcoin logo
oh could you imagine like I feel like
some things are gonna happen I feel like
look at way - the way mining works I
feel like they don't need to advertise
that but they don't do they really need
to advertise via already at the same
time is that like an essential need for
NVIDIA like that's where they get their
Merlin's all of your crew that's that's
like you know what I mean I don't know
4k right is that when using their their
GTX 1060 for 4k when it says on a gtx
1060 box 4k ready like it's the same
sort of thing
in a sense in a more balanced
competitive environment with less
fluctuations and volatility it makes
more sense to have to point out those
specifics that call your product out as
being superior to the other products
whereas in this environment of like any
graphics card you can get your hands on
for a relatively close to the MSRP it's
worth its weight in gold because you can
mine with that graphics card and make
your money back sure who cares about
those competitive advantages one way or
another right you're just gonna buy the
graphics card other Nvidia sold out
let's buy the AMD or vice versa yeah so
yeah like they don't they really don't
have to I don't think they have to care
right now about marketing to minors
because the products are all selling out
anyway so there's no reason to say like
here's where to buy my product over the
other product because they're all
getting sold so I mean who knows in the
future if if crypto becomes much more
mainstream and much more common and also
maintains its ability to be mined by
you know your standard person at home
with the standard house and you know
internet connection and electricity
costs and everything then maybe that
might be a concern as far as marketing
to somebody but I think for right now
they don't care yeah you can see that
yeah okay all right let's move on to a
much more exciting segment
tales from space I'm super excited
I'm glad saying that because like
there's so much good stuff right now
today so all right if you guys hate
SpaceX or Elon Musk or Tesla I would you
should probably stop watching right now
we're gonna praise this shit because I'm
willing to accept you know critique of a
company and that kind of thing you know
not no company's perfect and all that
kind of stuff but for right now we're
gonna be saying some pretty good stuff
about SpaceX because today SpaceX had
the fucking heavy test flights first
launch of the Falcon Heavy this video is
linked in the description if you guys
want to check it out it's about a forty
three minute livestream that started
earlier this is their heavy lift orbital
vehicle it can carry twice the weight of
the closest competitive rockets that's
available that's active right now today
it's a three booster rocket so if you
can see from the video right here
there's a separate booster there's a
central booster and then there's one on
either side
I saw his Instagram post of like how it
all works in CA and it took off today
from Cape Canaveral wait
back to that look up took up today from
Cape Canaveral and it was really really
super awesome to behold and every
thoughts dual dual rockets carrying the
the main three rockets three rockets
okay a central one and then two on
either side and they have a they've put
a Tesla Roadster yes with a spaceman it
the tip of that yeah that's a big one so
when you're testing a new rocket like
this one you need to put a payload in
there because the the the the the the
base level assessments of any rocket
like this is how much weight can it take
from ground level on earth up to near
Earth orbit geostationary orbits or all
the way to Mars right and that's
basically what this is all about when
you do an initial launch of a new rocket
that's untested you have to put
basically dummy dummy payload in there
right dummy cargo yeah and prior to now
because apparently like United Launch
Alliance and other other companies that
have made commercial rockets have no
idea what they're doing when it comes to
marketing right they've put like cement
blocks and stuff like that and they're
sure just because they're trying to get
put some way in there
right Elon Musk because he has some idea
of how to market things reference last
week's article about them selling 10,000
flame flowers yeah he knows a thing or
two
he decided let's put a Tesla Roadster in
there in fact his Tesla Roadster oh this
is very own yeah his Tesla Roadster so
they used that as as the payload it
shows confidence that he's you know he's
confident I was gonna make it up there
yeah the Falcon Heavy has been planned
since 2011 and we've talked about the
Falcon 9 and we've covered fucking nine
launches and showing on for the past
couple years fucking nine the the
benefit is that the actual rocket
returns to earth and lands hopefully
safely recently safely the vast majority
of the time and then can be reused which
greatly reduces the cost oh yeah I'm
watching something up into space the
fucking heavy is basically three fucking
nine rockets that are all kind of kind
of strapped together Wow
so one eye on the side as well as a
central rocket in the middle the central
rocket
has been updated and retrofitted the in
order to withstand the additional
stresses of the two rockets on either
side and each falcon 9 rocket has nine
merlin engines which are the engines
that SpaceX developed themselves back
when SpaceX X started and this is the
actual launch right right here they're
going down to one and this is like I
watched this live and it was just insane
it was insane
it's totally insane this is actually
happen like this rate that amazing cloud
did that just seemed didn't seem real to
so surreal it's so surreal but they
tracked the speed of it the whole time
it looks like something you'd see in a
Michael Bay movie
but like Michael Bay like there were no
special effects not like they were just
like no this is just natural life this
just happened like there were no nothing
this is this is real that's my wife the
fucking Hawaii has a low Earth orbit
payload capacity of up to a hundred and
forty thousand seven hundred pounds
which again is about double that of any
existing rocket that's that's an
operation right now so did the rockets
that brought this out into orbit did
they land back to the earth successfully
yeah so right now what you're seeing is
the the the first stage so all three of
the Falcon 9 rocket
basically here are firing all 27 engines
are firing right now accelerating the
speed you can see it constantly increase
km/h up there in the top right the
Falcon IVs supposed to be a key vehicle
for SpaceX to ferry goods and people
yeah between Earth and Mars right the
payload capacity again is a hundred and
forty-seven 140 thousand seven hundred
pounds for geostationary transfer orbit
I'm sorry that's that's for low-earth
orbit
geostationary transfer orbit capacity is
58 thousand
900 pounds so to bring it up a bit
higher for geostationary orbit or it can
take up to 37,000 pounds all the way to
Mars Wow so that's one of the big
impressive things about it since again
this is supposed to be kind of kind of
the workhorse for SpaceX when it comes
to ferrying both Goods and people
between Earth and Mars right the initial
launch was absolutely amazing to watch
live again if you guys want to check out
the video all of the people cheering at
SpaceX and everything was just very
inspiring to hear in my opinion one of
the best moments and I'll fast-forward
here a little bit to 37 40 one of the
best moments is right here so as
mentioned fucking nines the Rockets
being able to return to Earth and lands
right is very important so of course
three fuckin nines essentially along
this right two of them detached started
turning to return to Earth this is this
is the vertical look so you can see the
pad the the pad down there at the bottom
and although you're only getting a feed
from one rocket here both of them at the
same time one two right there look at
that just look lad this is lime notice
diable this is not a simulation anything
no it's not see jeez this is a slew of
them returning and landing at the same
is back no problem yeah amazing so now
they can be reused as SpaceX has been
doing for quite some time that saves
them just to fuel those Rockets is two
hundred thousand dollars and to make one
rocket is like 60 million dollars did
you say like 40 it's around 40 million I
think I read an article I was like thank
you the Falcon nine at least the Falcon
nine was like 16 million dollars to make
okay
also when a lot of money say when the
primary stage is detached and the final
stage with the actual Tesla Roadster on
it just has a single Merlin engine to
help direct it out to where it's
supposed to go how hard that is once the
stage one and two detach
they started playing David Bowie's very
appropriate yeah
the center core was actually supposed to
land on of course I still love you which
is one of their floating barges and I
didn't I didn't get a chance in the past
hour to hour and a half to get an update
on that but it seems like that probably
was the only part of this entire thing
that did not go according to plan but
the center core is also different from
the Falcon nines that they have launched
over the past couple years yeah this is
everyone like a sign that looks like a
sign right there right okay okay
so yeah the payload that it delivered of
course as I'll jump for it all but here
was Elon Musk's red Tesla Roadster yeah
it was funny because the Roadster on the
actual display can we get up to where
that is hey no that is say so when it we
need to attach the display on the Tesla
Roadster right where is it there's
there's the there's star man who was the
dummy who's wearing the right the new
SpaceX astronauts crew suit and oh it
was only if it's like for a split second
looks like I am I know there's a shot of
it earlier right well yeah come on all
right
right a second ago right there I see the
road sir yeah I see the stars don't
panic oh yeah yeah I didn't see that
earlier anyway yeah it says don't panic
on the heads-up display right and also
at least if you listen to Elon Musk he
said there's a towel as well in the
glove compartment
boys those are both references to the
Hitchhiker's Guide to the galaxy yeah
which also like David Bowie's using
David Bowie songs everything like this
is the funny thing about as we actually
delve into some space flight and that
kind of thing it's it's like there's
been so much sci-fi and stuff that has
been you know created over the past 50
plus years like there's so many
references that can be made to it when
we actually start doing some of this
stuff yeah it's so it's like fishing
itself it can becomes real yeah it's
yeah it's it's fun it's fun that way it
also becomes confusing because there's
so many different sci-fi like like
franchises and stuff like that like I
just I just watched a couple weeks ago
Battlestar Galactica I never actually
watched any Battlestar Galactica I
haven't seen either I haven't seen
either so the initial the first
mini-series or whatever just some
miniseries or movie and or whatever the
first first Battlestar Galactica bit was
that we watch shows it was very just fun
to watch
check it out nice but anyway fucking
heavy has successfully launched everyone
super excited especially because
Elon Musk himself was like hey it's
probably about a 50-50 chance it's just
gonna explode or blow up the launch it's
like how a front they are about that or
that kind of explode to bits will be the
greatest thing to ever mankind the Tesla
Roadster is destined for an earth Mars
orbit so it's not actually going to Mars
a lot of people have been like oh
there's any get to Mars or whatever but
it's going to a heliocentric orbit
between Earth and Mars and according to
their calculations that should be there
within for the next few hundred million
years nice although you know I must say
there's a very very slight chance that
it might crash land into Mars that's
probably a really outside chances I'm
guessing they were trying to keep things
relatively safe it's got to go through
the where was it there's a there's a
belt as a radiation adults the Van Allen
Van Allen belts
it's gonna have to pass through that
which is a zone of charged particles and
extreme radiation surrounding Earth's
and if it makes it through that then it
will be in a heliocentric orbit between
Earth and Mars the cost of the fucking
heavy a Falcon Heavy flight is only
ninety million dollars oh that's true if
you compare that to the a standard
fuckin nine flight it's sixty two
million dollars so it actually is Wow
really cheaper
see I mean not cheaper but for the
amount of extra weight that it can it
can relative in orbit yeah it is
relatively very cheap especially when
you compare it's like United Launch
Alliance and stuff that they're working
on that can is that because they have
reusable rockets there yeah the reason
Achatz is absolutely yeah a big factor
or them keeping their costs down nice
SpaceX has already booked upcoming heavy
flights for Arab sat which is a Saudi
Arabian communications company as well
as the United States Air Force so you
know musk prior to this had said we're
looking at three to six months to a
relaunch if it's successful probably
more like a year if it's unsuccessful so
three to six months probably before
we'll see in we'll be seeing another
fuckin heavy launch probably with an
actual payload next time nice so that's
that's pretty cool
following up on that Elon Musk did a
press conference prior to the launch
with a bunch of press and he happened to
mention something there that I thought
you guys make super heavy interesting
this super heavy the fucking super heavy
shit so if you looked at the three by
one configuration that the Falcon Heavy
that just launched had basically put two
more nine nine Merlin rocket a sporting
Falcon 9 rocket saw neither side giving
you a total of five as I'll just get you
free into orbit yes so two additional
side boosters on either side of the
fucking heavy giving it four total side
boosters plus the core booster Elon said
it would produced up to nine
pounds of thrust set liftoff which
potentially could enable the center core
to remain throttled down throughout much
of the launch so the 4x turn the for
exterior Rockets would provide most of
the lift and then you'd have a entire
fuckin nine at the center that they
would only have to use minimally to get
up you know out of a near-earth orbit
I've already done the heavy lifting by
then yeah yeah so that would allow a far
larger payload to be launched into orbit
thick boy rocket exactly the performance
would be roughly equivalent to the
Saturn 5 of the Apollo program because
as we I don't know if I mentioned this
but we're talking about existing
functional rockets that they're using
right now when we're comparing the
fucking heavy - what's previously
existed yeah the Saturn 5 that they used
to launch to do the the the moon landing
mm-hmm was capable of a significantly
was this cable capable of a lot of lift
right more than the fucking heavy right
but this would put it on par with that
140 metric metric tons to low Earth
orbit is impressive even more than what
it currently can do which is about like
the fucking heavy right now can can take
roughly the completely like a 747 mm-hmm
that's what it could take up into orbit
and they fueled up populated Ladin 747
yeah which is a lot of weight to take it
to take up into orbit so that's pretty
cool damn yes
so still questions about this how viable
is it is it just one of the things that
I must mentions randomly and passing but
it doesn't actually happen or is it
something that he's gonna start you know
doing tests on next week
no no who knows would all four boosters
plus the center core be recoverable the
fucking heavy that launched today the
two side boosters were recovered but
from everything we understand so far
probably the center booster was not
at least they cut away from that and
they haven't given any update on that so
probably that's the one downside or
negative to today's launch is the loss
of that Center that Center booster would
they need to update the current landing
zone where they laid the to the boosters
today to be able to land for okay at the
same press conference
Elon must said several times that the
interplanted planetary focused bfr
rocket is much higher priority than
future fuckin heavy development so no
worries staying two guys who are
following this closely the VFR is still
there and the VFR if you guys aren't
familiar qualify this is a super heavy
lift launch vehicle there is a late link
in the description to the Wikipedia page
on super heavy lift launch vehicles but
just has this fabulous little the little
diagram you can look at that shows you
the VFR the the big fucker runs a big
cock a big fucking rocket right here in
the more you wanna call it compared to
before example example the Saturn 5
which is on the far right as well as
that's not much smaller yeah and some of
these are theoretical some of these have
actually been watched there's more
information in the article if you guys
want to check it out
super heavy lift launch vehicles I find
fascinating yeah but for now let's move
on to getting a fucking heavy air Falcon
9 for yourself really gently used SpaceX
fucking nine has been listed on
Craigslist
what does this mean like it just fell
and someone like retrieved it recovery I
don't know this is some random city I
don't know some ties to the company
there it is the article you that the
article had the direct link wait where
did it go oh it's not there anymore did
they have lost ball today update oh come
on Florida today I hear the phrases nine
point nine million dollars or best offer
for sale on Craigslist nine point nine
million OBO this posting has been
flagged for removal okay here's a screen
cap of the actual
you can't sell a SpaceX rocket nine
point nine million dollars or best offer
offer per can never you must meet must
meet in the public's the seller the
seller said they accept cryptocurrency
so if you've been doing a lot of big
mining recently maybe this is your
option bring your own tub tugboat gently
used orbital rocket in good condition
fully loaded with onboard flight
computer launch and landing hardware
takeoff and land anywhere nine merlin
engines capable of producing 200 the two
hundred thousand foot-pounds of thrust
just chill it up and you're ready to go
says fucking nine on the body slight
burnt paint can be removed this is a
total joke this is a total scam yeah
mostly was having a heyday I don't know
if you I'm musk is really trained to
sell one of his old Falcon there's a big
list but whatever income from the
company you know it's possible one of
those investors all right taking
advantage one last bit of spacefaring
news here and this is for anyone who is
wondering where we're gonna go in these
spaceships Travis one we've talked a
little bit about it's a planet that was
discovered that has lots of planets
surrounding it in fact seven planets
that are small enough to be earth-like
and several of them are also inside the
habitable zone but habitable exactly two
separate papers are released this week
by scientists at narrowed down the
atmospheres of these planets because of
course what's the point of going there
and trying to figure out if we could
live if we don't already know whether
the atmospheres are conducive to life in
those planets
I thought the article was interesting
burned me because it specifically lists
how they're figuring some of this stuff
out so that will tell us go were
observes the star's light as a pet as
one of the planets passes in front and a
tiny fraction of that light a fraction
of the photons going through the planets
atmospheres like around the edges on the
side can actually be
observed and the colors of the light are
absorbed or scattered by the gases in
the atmosphere and so if you compare
that to the normal light that the star
it emits the gases that are absorbed
basically the gases in the atmosphere
that absorb that light will be emitted
from the standard spectrum of light than
this at the start emits sweet deal which
makes tons of sense
sure so based on that in all four you
can infer the atmospheres composition
the results don't tell us what's in the
atmosphere but they do tell us what's
not likely to be there hmm
specifically lots of hydrogen if they
tell us there's not lots of hydrogen
then that means that the planet might be
viable for a more say a class-m planet
if you're talking in Star Trek terms
class-m means they can beam down to the
surface and they don't have to wear a
mask or anything like that okay
it means it's a livable planet technique
using this technique they actually
eliminated all the planets in the trap
at all seven Trappists one planets
except for Trappist 1 G so trap it's 1 G
is the one that I care that's one I'm
gonna look a little bit closer at
separately a team of research
researchers looked into the composite
composition by a combination of
observations the transits of the planets
combined with their distance from the
star so here they're trying to figure
out what are these planets actually made
of because the star is actually very dim
Trappist one only emits a very dim
amount of light and made it more
challenging to use this method but
instead the researchers looked at how
much the planets pulled on each other so
they measured small variations and how
long the planet planets orbits took by
using that they were able to more
specifically to specifically determine
the mass of each planet they were able
to compare that and I'm gonna read this
because we're getting way too complex
for this level of steps into awesome
hardware and if authors put the planets
major properties into a single
vector and ran the vector through a
genetic algorithm that tested different
permutations of the vector that
recombines the most successful the
results was an optimized solution that
included the masses of all the planets I
don't know what the vector is so I
didn't understand any of that well you
should get the vector victor fish if you
guys want to check out the article Eris
Technica it is again linked in this
video's description I would encourage
you if you're interested a little bit
more about that based on all of this and
combined with the data on their position
relative to the star they are able to
conclude that the non rocky material in
B is almost certainly the atmosphere so
they're determining whether the say
squishiness of each planet is based on
the fundamental density of each planet
or just the atmosphere planets F G and H
could all be ocean worlds or covered
with a seashells depending on the amount
of greenhouse gases in their atmosphere
as they seashells yep and all this is to
say that they are able even though this
is really really far away to start
deducing what these planets are actually
made of which when it comes to
identifying EXO crap beyond our solar
system there's a word for beyond our
solar system excellent siliceous yeah so
when they find planets that are beyond
our solar system and actually determine
one one's that's you know in I don't
know 2050 hundred years we're actually
able to be like hey we're actually going
to send some people there they can have
a better idea of where we'd be able to
send people where they might actually
find something that's a livable planet
or environments that humanity could
expand to okay I'm glad I'm done talking
about anything for today's show so let's
move on to some donations yes let's do
it
oh my gosh all right you sell for don't
for deleting all the ones that weren't
that's really helpful now live reviews
with the five dollar donation says sup
guys back again to show my support
Paul excited to see what you haven't
served for us Kyle
the early access flow people playing
content Cheers hey Thank You El Jefe
thanks MA yeah I've been I've been
seriously out of the loop for the past
three weeks I have regular content
coming back this week I already have a
video shot yesterday another one planned
tomorrow another one later this week so
I have videos again for you guys this
week sorry you can forward or any of you
guys are disappointed I've been not
keeping up with it but I'm back I'm
gonna be back Paul back it's bud built
all right
$5 donation says donation cause my
birthday is this Friday and I like the
help of your videos and entertainment
thanks buck you spud belts appreciate it
I agree
Guido salducci $10 take my Doris love
you both I got the EVGA power link for
the asus rog strix like I said I would
do last week and it does block the
external 4 pin fan headers but it def
definitely fits fits but you're not able
to use those 4 pin fan headers on the
card honestly aren't necessary you don't
need them ya know they're there so you
can plug in some case fans and have them
spin at the same speed as your GPU fan
but honestly if you have a decent enough
motherboard you could probably get that
out of your motherboard how's the power
link block the fan headers on the
motherboard I don't understand cuz no
fan hitters on the graphics card oh okay
that's one of the Asus got its Strix you
know trying to differentiate your
graphics card and make it make it have a
feature that is somehow GA and ASA yeah
I mean BK put a couple four pin fan
headers on this right so that you could
plug those in so that your case fans
would wrap it up up when you're here do
you eat pika yeah warmer which makes a
lot of sense no it does but if you're
using that power link then yeah you can
make sense it blocks it yeah that's a
reconsider jujubee's five dollar
donation it says for the love of beer
take my money we shall indeed
Danny juice thank you and
atomic AJ seventy four five dollars is
Micro Center in tustin which is where we
live yeah there abouts worth the
three-hour drive there just to go
shopping I've never been and would like
to check it out I mean it depends one
one trip if you like one trip if you I
would only go like if you're talking
about a three-hour drive that's a lot
three hours I'm assuming that's one way
yeah it's that's like a day of driving
plus a little bit of time you could you
can see their prices before you go so
either prices if you know they have a
CPU and a motherboard combo that you
want yeah and they have a really good
CPU prices and pair it with a
motherboard he can usually get a really
good deal right then yeah I'd say it's
worth it mm-hmm you know you're gonna
get that you can shop around and see if
they have anything else you want and
check it out and Micro Center has really
good CPU prices if you have no idea and
you're like I'm just gonna drive three
hours and go window shopping or whatever
then it might be less worth your while
because yeah honestly it's just it
you're gonna make your store like this
there's nothing crazy they're gonna make
that drive already know in your head
what you're gonna buy when you get there
but if you have no expectations then
don't go only go if there's something
there that's way to drive that but our
new buy a CPU and a board exactly but a
lot of people are yeah that's a good
that's a good and if you are that's
totally a very legitimate reason to
drive that far cuz you can live you can
probably save as much money as three
hours for me it was always like you
should I Drive - see for me
gas both ways should I Drive should I
Drive 40 to 45 minutes each way to save
50 bucks and for me as long as I thank
ya yeah that's yeah choose the right
time to go and it's worth it for you cuz
you have to value the experience to like
ya microphone how much is your time
worth yeah
we're analyzing this too much Iranian
but thank you for your donation
yes in Marcos got a question I'm looking
to buy a used GPU locally and my options
currently are a gtx 960 or a gtx 770
what would you choose for gaming I mean
you're good either way I guess I feel
like he doesn't matter whichever one is
cheaper at that point if they're the
same price then I would go to 960 just
because it's newer I would try I would
try to claw my way up to a 970 honestly
yeah and you can get a 9 sound that
might be a decent decent bump up and
press over the 960 yeah but the 970 is
still very solid GPU yeah definitely
yeah we can even do some 1440p giving no
problem yeah try one of those but thank
you very much for your donation Shane
smart five dollars and Shane smarty
hello change for ten to double double
back to buy another 16 gigabytes of
flare X 3200 Ram or not at the moment I
game and also use my PC as a workstation
do you think the prices will drop soon
right now the same kit I bought in July
is $80 more Shane we can't promise any
price drops anytime soon it's not gonna
change but anything probably they're not
gonna get any worse so what I would say
is if you're okay if you're getting by
for the time being then wait unless
leading Universal unless you have a
situation where you're like I really
need this extra memory it's really
affecting me right whatever anything
right things are so bad right now that
the best option it's really good so just
just wait like be keep worst case you'll
wait a couple ups and then buy the
memory for the same price that is it as
it is now right I can't see it getting
more expensive for for like everything
you hope that doesn't happen
yeah and you can probably get some
g.skill ripjaws 5 memory for a bit
cheaper than the flare X just if you
want to save 10 20 bucks or whatever
look into that because
just as validating just a stable on
Verizon platforms and so forth so you
don't need to get flex if it's validated
by your motherboard manufacturer then
you're okay yeah
Jeremy Suarez with the $10 nation and an
emoji little emoticon which I like I
like your emojis looks very triumphant
it's kind of yeah
fight the power airing thanks Jeremy
yeah I get that Center negative five
dollar donations for Paul being a fellow
space h h dt g st TNG weak and afraid to
express it
Thank You Center a Star Trek The Next
Generation
I'm not nerdy enough to know that I mean
if I have any Star Trek credit it's
probably due to my wife yeah she's
mother was a big fan of the original the
original series back in the day Brian
Richards $5 no comment just
determination as long as well as not
landing oh four or five dollars
cheers to both of you because you did
not say anything you're just doing I
think money I didn't recognize HH GTG at
first Hitchhiker's Guide to the go
yeah those figures yeah I would have
never know how the fuck would I have
known that acronym I love that movie but
seen a million times for ever read the
book never in the book it's available on
audiobook
it's a good idea I was gonna say that
would require me a long distance trip
which I might do pretty soon actually
take it one okay Chris Koon Bob gross I
don't always get to tune in every week
like I want to because of a crazy work
schedule I love both your channels
thanks for all you do
thank you that's nice that's nice
comment and we're we appreciated your
when you're able to tune in when you are
able to yeah next up we've got the
Christic cystic Sarris the cystic gamer
for five Australian perhaps what you
guys think about the courser 900 d it's
very large it's very large um I feel
it's lost the sense of its identity from
the original obsidian series cases I
feel like it doesn't seem like an
obsidian serious case but it's like the
more modern version which some people
are gonna like no doubt they're gonna be
like it's just the way to go
I just I'm more reminiscent to the older
generation and I feel like they didn't
really I don't get any sense of that DNA
I don't get that old obscene series DNA
from the new 900 E and it's gonna rely
it really depend on testing to see if
the airflow is good and temperatures are
good inside of my case but station for
that later this year Ryan Richards $5 I
have a gigabyte Horace's motherboard and
some trends ii r gb ram but i'm having
trouble controlling the air to be room
any suggestions what do you mean by what
do you mean by controlling that RGB ramp
do you mean by the lighting effects or
like the actual frequencies that you're
getting so Ryan if I'm guessing you're
talking about them delight right that'd
be my guess
so I'm not positive it's the most recent
gigabyte horas software for their RGB
control which is what is it what's the
gigabyte RGB um or a sink or a sink yeah
I'm not 100% positive if that is
competitor actually compatible with the
transi RGB Ram yeah but I do know that
the Tritons er gb ram has its own
control software it does that you can
download and load up yourself right it
is very closely tied to the Aces or a
software yeah but you can get the G sync
software that looks like the aces or a
software that's just the G skills I said
G sync it sounds like that's new that's
just the G SkillSoft for you to control
that and you should be able to download
that software and control your g.skill
RGB memory
by itself right granted you would
probably have that software controlling
your memory and then probably the
separate software for gigabyte horas
controlling but your motherboard are
jeebies and that might be difficult to
sync up together and everything just
saying though that that's if you want
control over your trad NCR gb ram yeah
you're probably gonna want to try to
download that software or head up
gigabyte and be like hey why isn't your
software controlling my memory yeah
little ISM shift is OT to drift whatever
v just rally and the best wired gaming
headsets that are comfortable I've been
using the happy to recommend my your
Sennheiser's yeah except these aren't
available anymore there's our lives I
they said wired oh I thought okay wired
oh yeah
that's wired getting access to yeah
that's that's a really good option this
one's not available anymore don't leave
a next generation yeah this is next
chance is the PC 360 which is like a
good three four years max I'm called
like the game one or something like that
okay yeah but if you're willing to spend
150 to 200 dollars and you get a headset
Iser headset that's hundred and fifty to
two hundred dollars the sounds gonna be
great you're gonna be happy yeah like
that's yeah I trust Sennheiser over
gaming products more than most gaming
companies they know their audio pretty
well yeah alright wishbone five dollars
last challenge idea Carlin Paul to lick
each other's head no also III tickets
are going on sale February 12th are you
guys gonna go depends on the proximity
to Computex proximity theater how close
usually what's going in six days
according to him tickets go on sale oh
oh but III is often the week after
Computex right am i sorry yeah it's
right after competition yeah yes it's
it's tough because you
jet lag and all that and it's it's
gaming focused and not Hardware focused
so there's all those complications but
we'll see maybe this you'll be different
J Everett $15 first you guys encouraged
me to buy an Nvidia 10 Series in
December thank you
second X $2.99 motherboard
recommendation question mark not
planning to do a full cover waterblock
or custom loop any ideas for cool VRMs
thanks
second generation X Turner and
motherboard recommendation I was I'd go
with ace I was gonna say asrock if you
want something an expensive Florez the X
$2.99 chi-chi right it says all the
standard things that you would yeah
watch that she's arena if you don't want
anything really high-end friends it's
the most reasonably priced sure of the X
$2.99 motherboard so that's kind of
where I would lean if you're looking for
like you know you want to take your ear
Intel skylake X processor and really
overclock it and do a lot of stuff like
that then maybe look at some of the Asus
x99 options yeah but yeah they're all
really expensive I think is what it
comes down to for that so that's why I
leaned towards the asrock because it's
it's a solid by the board gets the job
done and you're not gonna pay an extra
100 to 200 dollars right like you will
with some of the higher ends MSI or
insu's options that kind of thing if VRM
Cooling's also your primary concern I
would also consider a be waiting out for
the X 470 boards because he says he's
not planning to do a full cover water
blocker custom Lupus huh I mean even
then I mean if the RM cooling is your
concern like was the one export was a
gigabyte was the only one at CES this
year the head of next 470 board yeah
and the vrm the heatsink that they had
on that was a real aluminum fin stack
heatsink it was pretty legit yeah
compared to like all the other aesthetic
based you know like looks forward
designs we've seen in the past they
actually had a pretty decent heatsink on
there vrm like the motherboard looked
pretty substantial in terms of
cooling as opposed to just like making
it look pretty so it's something to
consider as well that's moving on here
if you very much for their condition we
have Dave nunu five Canadians both of
you were instrumental in my recent build
Thanks is it worth getting the EVGA
hybrid water cooling kit from my EVGA
1080i super clock any quieter the hybrid
water cooling kit does ebj sell a hybrid
water cooling kit similar to NZXT or
they have their I know EVGA who has
water-cooled 1080 T eyes I am not card
ready to go I have to assume based on
the question that they still have an
upgrade kit for the air-cooled cards
yeah I don't know I haven't seen that
directly um I have Xavier that would be
like mostly your preference so like 75%
of that would be you wanting to water
cooler 1080i right and like absolutely
maximize the overclocking and potential
whatever 75% of that's you 25% of that
is like a viable investment as far as
improved performance to to the money
you're spending you're not gonna get
that much more out of your 1080i right
EVGA is air coolers do a very fine job
and and a noise isn't gonna change that
much either probably be a little bit
quieter yeah but you're trading what are
you trading a fan or a few fans running
at higher rpms to a couple fans running
at lower rpms plus a pump it's
diminishing log returns yeah so honestly
you don't need to upgrade to a water
cooling solution for your 1080 T is see
you that said if you want to do that if
you want to tear your computer apart and
get in there and do an upgrade if you've
always wanted to try water cooling to
see what difference it makes when it
comes to your GPU temperature and stuff
like that then go for it
yeah that's that's what that stuff's
there okay makes a pretty decent
aluminum-based AIO
kit for your GPU and your CPU and also I
have a couple of those up there yeah the
gaming the gaming kit so that's yeah the
game introduction there's an option to
if you want to get your foot in the door
very low barrier to entry and stuff in
terms of cost and experience that's
that's a way to go Dave no it moto moto
sport again $5 feel bad dumping all the
donations only on only side a are you
guys doing console videos at any point
PCM are but Xbox one X is an attractive
option I've considered doing a video
actually on the new Rison chips that
have Rx Vega built-in abuse the new AP
use that versus a console solution for
gaming when you're talking about 30 fps
because that's basically what consoles
are running at when you're talking about
Xbox and stuff that's that's something
to consider
so yeah I'm potentially going to be
doing some content around that topic but
I can't really reveal revealing much
more than that
okay yeah I don't have anything planned
so will even believe Kyle's response is
a good response in that one thank you
for your donation for sure Christian and
no five dollar donation is there reason
why companies can't develop ap use that
will run all of today's games with
decent fps can miners exploit those as
well we're probably gonna be hearing a
lot more about that in the next same
month or two as AMD's ApS actually
launched and people gets a little bit
more hands-on time with them especially
the Vega the ones that they get GPUs
integrated my gut thought is probably
not it's probably not going to be
something that is a viable solution for
purchasing and running at a reasonable
power draw to output rate but I'm sure
that people - that'll be people testing
them out and I'm at least definite
cements and to tell you like hey what's
better to buy this aim the APU with
integrated graphics or this GTX 1063 gig
that should have cost one hundred and
fifty dollars but it's actually selling
for four hundred dollars right now yeah
I feel like the answer to that would be
pretty straightforward yeah but we'll
test it out and give you guys an actual
answer to that yeah yeah I'm not
expecting miners to be exploiting ap use
but never seen everything
we are salucci with the one more
donation weird question can i benefit
from the 1070 TI and a 660ti sli or is
it just dream and I'm silly for even
thinking of it six six ET a-- is a
paperweight
right now you can you definitely cannot
sli them you can for and video
requirements you have to sli the exact
same GPU with the exact same memory
configuration
yeah you could set up your 660ti sli or
you could set up your 660ti to process
physics for example sure as a physics
processor but honestly not worth it
probably probably not worth it your 1070
TI is probably perfectly capable of
handling that on its own without the
additional power draw that would be
required from having another completely
separate GPU hooked up so your 660ti is
probably time to hand it down or put it
in the display case for posterity
or or sell it or yeah whatever there's
other options for you but eventually
graphics cards do reach the end of their
useful life yet 60 Ti is probably it's
getting close unless you're only focused
on really entry-level low resolution
games it's approaching full age finally
hyper chopper 5 dog nation says woo back
you have a dropper yeah alright guys
we've got some Johnson Chevy Johnson's
Lucas oh my gosh CPU cooler
thank you very much Lucas Kevin from
