Pauls hardware today is Monday but it's
also going to be inventory day for
better or for worse because this is my
workspace and further over to the right
side there is just piles of stuff and
I'm usually okay with a little pile of
stuff as long as I can see what's in the
pile
but once the piles start piling on top
of each other and I can't even see
what's in the piles that's when the
piles need to be dealt with so I'm going
to go through all that crap I'm gonna
categorize it and put it in piles I
don't know if that's LTE or not doesn't
matter I'm going to clear some space in
the living room out there so I can
separate everything and lay it all out
so I can see what's there what I should
keep what I'm going to get rid of and
what I'm going to sort of just hang on
to for a long term you know nostalgic
person purposes not going to think
honestly what I really want to do though
is just clear the floor out so I can
sweep it because I have two dogs it's a
little hairy sometimes
Oh
isn't here cute yes he is I'm getting
distracted though all right so
everything has been kind of cleared out
and moved out into my assessment area
and I also wanted to point out real
quick before I dive into the inventory
list that yes this project has taken me
a couple days now which wasn't the
original plan but that's kind of how it
goes sometimes
more on that in just a minute but I also
wanted to say that the hardware I'm
going to be counting outside includes
all of my loose hardware so the stuff
that's not currently in use so it means
it doesn't include stuff I have here for
upcoming projects yes that's an ek logo
doesn't include well those are just
boxes of randomness or whatever doesn't
include systems that I have set up and
running so like my testbed here I've
switched over to the $3500 system here
using in the corner for gaming when I
when I livestream and stuff of course
the live streaming system that's over
there camera equipment is not included
but I do have a list so let's go down
that alright so here it all is out in
the dining room and I gotta get this
stuff taken care of because I have
promised mrs. Paul Hardware that's I
will have it cleared up by the end of
the day today actually I promised her
that yesterday too but point being
though I've organized this very clearly
in two separate sections so this section
over here is for large items like cases
power supplies CPU coolers that sort of
thing
table over there is for smaller items
such as CPUs Ram hard drives optical
disks underneath I have set aside a
little bit of space for accessories and
other miscellaneous stuff although I
didn't do the count on that one quite as
much then finally over here not to be
confused with the the dog food stuff
that's dog food over there these these
are boxes and they're all empties so
there's nothing in any of these but I do
like to keep empty boxes because as you
might have seen when I disassembled a
couple systems over the course of the
last day or two I got lots of old retail
boxes that I had saved and I was able to
repackage stuff in them let's run down
the actual inventory here starting with
this big old pile of cases I tried to
keep this visible but there's more
tucked down there there's two there's
two sets stacked and I have eight cases
so which isn't too bad all things
considered although they do take out the
fair amount of room and only one of
these is an ITX the EVGA head room down
there next up in this healthy pal right
here I have power supplies only a few of
them still in their boxes many of them
with their cables just splayed out on
the floor like that only
total power supplies not too much to be
said about those and I guess I should
also mention this plan which is also
power supply cables somehow I've ended
up with way more of these than actual
power supplies moving out here to
motherboards which are all stacked
nicely yes yes that's an 8-bit
motherboard over there total I have 24
motherboards that aren't in use
currently just in their retail boxes
eighteen of them are ATX three of them
or our micro ATX and three of them are
mini ITX and I did two accounts and 19
of these or Intel only five AMD although
I do have the majority of the AMD
sockets that have come out just recently
moving out the CPU coolers which I have
way too many of I want to point out here
real quick and this applies to the
motherboards as well not all of these
are 100% functional actually that also
applies to the video cards down here but
most of them are and I total have 25 CPU
coolers six of these are stock air
coolers like you get from Intel or AMD
14 of them are air coolers that includes
the stock ones including the ETS T 40 as
well and like a cooler master hyper 212
and then I have ten uh closed loops
liquid coolers but again at least one or
two of those aren't totally functional
and several of them have been used and
like the pump wasn't totally working
right or whatever so I kind of feel bad
getting rid of those but that's a lot of
CPU coolers here's my lineup of GPUs
again I have lots and I switched over to
automatic settings on my camera also by
the way because it's just too bright
here but I tried to organize these from
like newest GPUs here going all the way
down to oldest GPS over there but until
I have 40 freaking graphics cards that's
what you're looking at right here twelve
of them are from AMD or ATI so even
including the older ATI versions like
the all and wonder down there 28 of them
are from Nvidia so go ahead and call me
an Nvidia fanboy or whatever I don't
know that's just how it all fell out and
then we have nine reference designs so
like for instance the Nvidia reference
designs that they've been sending me
recently and then we have 16 of what I
would call current gen graphics cards so
that includes in videos 910 series as
well as AMD's 300 and 400 series so a
pretty good amount of these cards are
actually pretty recent which is cool
because those are the ones that I kind
of need most for testing and comparison
and that kind of thing
I kind of like the history
three that you have going on here those
like 980 980ti down to the lesser cards
in the 900 series 960 right here for gig
and two gig 787 another 780 at 760 I do
have a 770 in between there that's in
use 6 75 85 75 50 TI for 64 64 64 60 GTX
I think that's a 460 GTX as well and all
the way down to my Wow my old GTX 260
played a lot of World of Warcraft on
that one
I also have an ATI all in wonder because
it's good to have one of those also I
don't think I pointed this out but five
of these now here aren't even graphics
cards they're just graphics cards
coolers that I've removed and then
water-cooled graphics card lastly here
for the large items got the VR a vive
and an oculus rift although to be honest
the vive isn't in the box but that I
have both of those let's move on to the
small but very valuable items which are
all laid out on the table here let's
start with the big dawgs over here
though CPUs all laid out here I have a
total of 20 CPUs in this little
collection seven of them are AMD 13 of
them are from Intel and I already did a
video on my CPU collection so I'll link
that via a card if you guys want to
check out a little bit more info s4
memory Wow look at all that memory you
think I would remember things better
with all of this memory but I don't have
a total of 64 actual memory dims here
which I thought was kind of nice because
the power of 2 a total of 160 4.25
gigabytes of memory if you add it all up
together although again down here
especially in the older stuff not all of
it is 100% functional moving on up here
to permanent storage I have hard drives
they're all right here the big hard
drives of these like my 4 terabyte
drives and those are 4 terabyte drives
then I have like a WD velociraptor and
some older drives here I think I still
have some older hard drives kicking
around somewhere I couldn't locate them
all right I don't know where the rest of
them are but I feel like I had more than
this at one point anyway I counted total
22 hard drives that includes a 3.5 inch
and the 2.5 inch 10 of them are 3.5 inch
drives 12 of them are 2.5 inch drives
but the 3.5 inch drives here it's a
total of twenty thousand five hundred
and thirty point three gigabytes and
thanks mainly in part to the fort
everybody drives and then for the 2.5
inch drives over here again several of
these do not work so I'm sorry about
that but most of them that are newer do
it's a total of 12 2.5 inch drives
though there's an extra one hiding
underneath that little guy right there
and that also includes these three
external drives total one thousand seven
hundred and sixty six point five
gigabytes so total mechanical drive
storage I'm up to twenty two point three
terabytes SSDs right over here I have a
total of 15 SSD drives arrayed in front
of me right here 14 of them are 2.5 inch
drives for a total of two thousand two
hundred and eighty four gigabytes one of
them is an m2 that one right there
that's 256 gigabytes so for total SSD
storage here I have two thousand five
hundred and forty gigabytes or about 2.5
terabytes and some last items optical
drives of course I have a total of five
arrayed in both DVD as well as a few
blu-ray drives in there two floppy
drives still hang on under those I need
if I ever need to copy my old doom discs
and then I even have a couple actual
sound cards here an old OTG card from
Sound Blaster was also Asus Phoebus
epilogue time all right it is Sunday now
so considering I started this project on
Monday it basically took me all week
that's not to say I wasn't doing other
things at the same time but I'm happy to
be able to say look the dining room
table it's clear and usable I do have a
few piles out here I said I was going to
be separating everything into piles but
these are all functional piles I promise
for instance that is the e-waste file
down there have some more that in the
garage to this pile right here is the
get rid of pile so this is all going to
be either giveaway donation or possibly
some sales going on as well and I will
determine all that stuff later I promise
I do have some very good ideas I think
for how to you know deal with that stuff
this is all just big boxes empty boxes I
have a lot of boxes to break down but
you might notice that the old empty
retail boxes are not there anymore
this is also the dog area here we're
going to try to reconfigure this corner
for the dogs and move those chairs and
everything Hiro's enjoying a snack much
heat in there here always good it's a
good here's your glitch snack isn't it
moving on to the garage though very
proud of all the progress and worked out
here turning the lights on all right so
first of all you might notice most of
these shelves are clear have a couple
just little displays going on I do have
some video cards up there basically
besides the Radeon RX 4 80 and then the
970 there all the rest of those are like
dead cards that I'd I don't know I
didn't want I didn't want just toss them
in a cycling bin so they're just up
there on display here I got the testbed
projects I'm working on I just set up
this system last night and I didn't
really record it but this is for project
that's coming up this week other than
that everything over here is pretty much
normal in the same over here though I
got my CPU storage devices in memory and
that's all good to go
up here you know just did some
arrangements of things the stuff on the
right though this is where the most work
has been done notice the table is clean
I need to get a topper for this table I
think I'm going to cover it with
something also over here the nice and
organized we have a motherboards up top
graphics cards are next and yes as a
reviewer I have to kind of keep way too
many graphics cards on hand this shelf
is coolers and that shelf is power
supplies the three large boxes that you
see over here that one that one and that
one these are the two for the systems
that I'm currently using and they have
all the retail boxes for the parts of
them inside and then that's all the rest
of my retail boxes for stuff that's
currently in use I was originally going
to use the enthu Pro instead of the 760
T for this project AB coming up this
week but it was actually a little bit
too small on the top but um anyway other
than that a few more random items here
some foam insulation that I'm going to
be putting in very soon and then look
it's pretty much clear over here - I've
even taken all of my like car washing
stuff and and like like chores stuff and
put it over here on the right so it's
separate from all like the tech stuff so
this side of the garage is pretty much
all tech stuff now anyway the guys this
has been my inventory day video I hope
you have enjoyed it
if you did hit the thumbs up button
thanks for watching and we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
