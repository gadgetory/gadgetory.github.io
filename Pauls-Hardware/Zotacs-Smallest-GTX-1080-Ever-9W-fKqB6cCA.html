my coverage of CES 2017 we're kicking
things off here with some reports from
the zotac suite which is here at the
Palms Casino I want to start off by
saying a huge thank you to my sponsors
for this event coverage gigabyte Toshiba
as well as deep cool a big thanks to
them and click on their links down in
the description below now ZOTAC had
quite a few things to show off for us
here currently Jo is doing a
demonstration playing some Gears of War
4 on this tiny little mini ITX system
now the system itself is pretty cool
it's got a skylight core i5 in there and
everything but the main thing that
they're showing off is this graphics
card which you might look at and think
oh that's like a cute little 1070 or 10
60 or something that's not true this is
a 1080 a full-on GTX 1080 in a package
that is two slots wide and just about
eight and a half inches long which is
definitely one of the tiniest probably
the tiniest gtx 980 i've seen the zotac
has done some other upgrades to this for
example they have of course continued
with their nice backplate design thing
on there as well as a cool looking
shroud the backplate they've gone with
the more subdued design so black and
silver on there they've gotten rid of
the yellow now the yellow is a fun
accent but perhaps a bit too much color
for people who didn't want yellow to be
the main accent color in their system
and yeah as you can see it's performing
just fine fits in I mean this case can
obviously support much larger graphics
cards but if you have a small case or a
scratch build or you just want to fit a
ton of power into a very small package
you can with this GPU now my questions
about it we're like is everything to
spec normal and yes it is still got the
eight gigs of gddr5 X memory and the
clock speeds are still running at the
reference specs that Nvidia provides for
that founders edition cards so
specifically that is 16 20 megahertz
boost base clock and 1759 megahertz
boost clock which is very impressive
and nice to know that they've been able
to make a much smaller card and not
sacrifice on the clock speeds next up is
a product that so tech actually recently
announced and launched at their 10-year
anniversary events it's right here it's
very heavy
it is a GT X 1080 with a water block on
it
the zotac worked with Thermaltake
actually to put together so again they
have their more subdued version of the
back plate here with the silver stripe
going across it instead of the yellow
stripe and then just a monstrous water
block on there and I'm going to actually
cheat here for just a moment this is
called the GTX 980 Arctic storm thermal
take ten-year anniversary edition which
is quite a mouthful
of course all the standard specs for a
1080 you would expect it has two BIOS
ease integrated ones a 1632 megahertz
base and 1771 megahertz boost second
BIOS will bring that boost clock up to
1797 and of course we all know gtx cards
will often boost themselves up much
beyond that and of course if you're
getting this card you should probably
just overclock it yourself get yourself
much higher clock speeds than that
everything else is pretty much the same
GG 1/4 compression fittings a spectral
lighting system integrated as well and
that again all copper Thermaltake block
in there and especially designed
motherboard from ZOTAC with 16 power
phase delivery so a monstrous crazy card
and ZOTAC actually said they haven't had
many people review this card so far so
let me know in the comments if you guys
would be interested in me doing a
specialty review of a graphics card that
comes pre equipped with a high-end
waterblock
like this one pretty cool card from
ZOTAC and now we're over here at this
table where they have very very small
computers and if you're familiar with
ZOTAC you know that they make really
tiny computers they're often proprietary
designed to some degree but I like the
zotac often gives you some expandability
options as well so very frequently
you're able to take these little systems
apart dive in there and maybe upgrade a
2.5 inch hard drive or add additional
memory they typically don't solder the
memory on or anything like that but they
have refreshed this line of mini pcs
specifically 4 KB Lake and this one that
I'm holding right now is actually
passively cooled so they're pretty cool
a kind of honeycomb design going around
the outside plenty of ventilation on all
four sides more specifically this is the
mini PC CI 5 4 9 Nano it has an i5 7300
you processor which I believe is a 35
watt TDP version includes v pro and
unite which are functions that you
probably not as interested in unless
you're doing stuff in an office
environment but it's basically security
that's integrated into the hardware that
allows you to more securely remote into
do video conferencing and that kind of
thing also tons of Io available on these
I like the DES vinaigre Tedeschi card
slots then you also have
not two but three USB type-c connectors
two on the front that a USB 3.1 there's
also a USB 3.0 up there three more USB
3.0 on the back as well as Wi-Fi
integrated and then that Thunderbolt
port so that Thunderbolt port of course
worked for Thunderbolt connectivity it
also is backwards compatible with USB
3.0 so you can use it as an extra USB
port if you want to or you know use
Thunderbolt because Thunderbolts pretty
freakin awesome
what's also pretty freakin awesome is
that's again this thing is entirely
passively cooled now that's one option
this entire table is arrayed with
different variations different sizes
depending on your needs and how much
power and that kind of thing but the one
they actually have set up here with a
doom demo running is really cool because
it's the mini PC mi5 4 9 nano I 570 300
u processor in there of course it's got
Intel HD graphics you know the KB like
processors have upgraded graphics for
this generation which is one of the I
guess I don't say the few benefits but
you know KB like go watch my video on KB
like if you want to hear more about
performance but benefits and performance
and features is additional support for
Thunderbolts as well as multiple m2
devices as well as the capability to do
something like this tiny little box
right here it does have active cooling
on this one there's a little bit of a
fan but they have a thunderbolt
connection going up here to this little
box or perhaps slightly larger box
depending on your basis for comparison
this is what is currently known as the
zotac external graphic stock which is I
believe a working title but basically
it's an external box that you can
connect up via Thunderbolts to put a
dedicated graphics card a discrete GPU
in and then you can connect up something
like a laptop or one of these little
mini ZOTAC systems and use that as your
GPU so you can have a very small
lightweight low-power system and then if
you want to switch over to some gaming
plug in this box get yourself a full
size graphics card it's going to
integrated 400 watt power supply and
it's still work-in-progress they said
that this outer shell is supposed to be
a gunmetal grey but a little bit darker
than what is right now which is more of
a silver which I think which would
probably be a better bet if they went
that route they do give you some extra
connectivity in there three USB 3.0
ports of course that Thunderbolt 3
type-c connector there's some LED
lighting
integrated and supports up to 13-inch
graphics cards and even triple slot
graphics cards if you need something
like that currently this unit again is
just a demo unit so there's no active
cooling but they are going to put
possibly one maybe two fans in there
they were talking about maybe
integrating a handle up on there somehow
so I'm this still work-in-progress so
I'm going to close this video by again
asking you guys for some feedback let
ZOTAC know what you think they should do
with this box because I like the concept
of external graphics talks it provides a
lot more flexibility especially if
you're the type of person who likes to
use a laptop everywhere and you still
want to get some gaming in and Lord
knows we could use some competition for
the Razer core because that thing is
just really expensive so let's ZOTAC
know what you think of this design of
course let's otech know what you think
of the other products that we've talked
about today stay tuned for more coverage
from CES 2017 coming right at you and
thanks for watching pauls hardware hit
