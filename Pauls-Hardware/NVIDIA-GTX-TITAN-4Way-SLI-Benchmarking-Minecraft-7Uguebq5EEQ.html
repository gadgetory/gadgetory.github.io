everyone welcome to Paul's hardware
thanks for stopping by and in case you
hadn't noticed yet I currently have
access to this these are for NVIDIA GTX
Titans they're currently set up in
four-way SLI no less in fact this is
actually our new ITV testbed I have
brought it home for the weekend to catch
up a little bit of benchmarking because
well there's lots of benchmarks to run
through also when we benchmark in the
video room there it gets really really
warm so I'm kind of removing some of
that heat transferring it home but while
I have it here I figured well why not do
something from my channel I mean I got
the four Titans right now I've got a 39
60 X processor in there I got a quad
channel g.skill Trident X memory kit in
there got a real hercules 1600 watt
power supply powering the whole thing
what else oh yeah I got SanDisk Ultra
Plus 240 gig SSD that's kind of our
testbed configuration right now and of
course the cooler master hyper 212 Evo
which I'm going to swap out for a liquid
cooler I promise
everyone's like hey you got four Titans
and you're got a $30 cooler
let's get cooler but anyway before I get
too distracted I am doing a full slew of
benchmarks on this configuration doing
some tests comparing our existing
two-way benchmarks we're also going to
do three-way and four-way of course see
what kind of performance what kind of
scaling we get what current benchmarks
and programs are actually able to even
take advantage of the extra video cards
but what besides that might I do for my
own channel because all those benchmarks
are gonna be able to find over the new
ITV YouTube channel if they're not up
now they'll be up there soon for my
channel gosh there's so many different
possibilities you know I've never played
minecraft before
okay guys so just bring you up to speed
I've been playing Minecraft for a while
now maybe perhaps too long but anyway
here's my house that I've built I didn't
really go at it with any plan design I
just kind of built and then started
adding on wings here and there got a
fence around the outside and I think I
hear an Enderman coming so I'm gonna
head on inside inside you'll notice I
have a ballroom it's pretty nice like
have parties here the glass windows were
just a recent addition threw those on
just to class the place up a little bit
my beds upstairs I also have a rooftop
up here with the tower that I kind of
built originally just to sort of take a
closer look at the lay of the land but
now it also makes my house easy to spot
so that's helpful down in the basement I
have a very long stair that goes down to
the lower mines where I mined and look
for precious ore in minerals and trying
to find some more diamonds I got some
but then I died and I lost them oh
there's a spider I'm gonna kill it
good spider head alright next I often
see people in Minecraft building large
elaborate structures so I wanted to have
a go at it didn't have too much time but
here's my sign my pulse hard we're
saying I put torches
looks kind of cool um let's see what
else oh I I almost forgot I am supposed
to be benchmarking aren't I
because I'm playing this with four
Titans all right branson benchmarks and
basically averaging around 300 frames
per second 304 0.67 to be more specific
min FPS at 33 max of 565 so definitely
four Titans totally the way to go if
you're going to be playing Minecraft in
case you're wondering yeah I've been
enjoying Minecraft so far I think it's
pretty fun I probably should stop I
think I'm probably not gonna play after
after this little demo this was actually
my first time I don't know maybe maybe
I'll just maybe I'll play like one more
time player tonight like after I finish
editing this but that is gonna wrap it
up for this video guys and I hope you
have enjoyed I just wanted to do
something a little bit different with my
4-way Titan configuration that I have
right now
anyway if you'd like to see more tech
videos or videos similar to this one
probably not the same you can find those
on my Paul's hardware YouTube channel
don't forget to subscribe
throw me a like if you enjoyed this
video and we'll see you all next time
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
