hello everyone and welcome to Falls
Hardware today's video is an epic
unboxing and you may or may not have
opinions on unboxings and whether or not
they are epic in and of themselves but
what I've got is my hull from Black
Friday and Cyber Monday this year so I
heard lots of stuff this is all stuff
that I ordered directly and paid for
just in case you're wondering and I'll
put links to it in the description those
are gonna use affiliate links just so
you know but hey clicking those helps me
out if you happen to buy any of this
stuff I'm going to show you some
comparisons of the prices I got on this
stuff too hopefully some historic prices
using camel camel camel and also tell
you where I got the different things and
what price had paid for them and all
that kind of stuff so I think we should
start small and we'll work our way up to
the bigger items let just like we do on
Christmas morning at my house and that
we're eventually going to get to that
Dell monitor in the back of the 43 inch
that is going to be the crowning
achievement of today's unboxing video so
let me move some stuff around let's get
started
our first item up for bids I actually
already opens because I thought there
was gonna be something else in the
package but this one came from Amazon
and whereas I have been hesitant when it
comes to the smart home stuff this was
one that I jumped on partially because
there was a deal for it most of these I
jumped onto the reveal this deals for
them this is a Wi-Fi smart power strip
surge protector so it works with Amazon
Alexa as well as Google assistance you
can plug different devices into that and
then you can use that to control stuff
like by saying the okay and then the
word Google and then asking it to do
things this is pretty much all there is
to it it's made by Conoco very simple
some USB power you know connectors on
there make it make it handy as well and
that's that's really all there is but
yeah to plug these in hopefully whatever
device they're using in here for the
Wi-Fi is not susceptible to some breach
but I got two of them and again a bit of
an impulse buy but we'll just see if I
can figure out some ways to use these up
here actually what I kinda wanted to do
was for Joe because he's not tall enough
to Joe is helping me film this today by
the way he's not tall enough to reach
where my light switches are so maybe I
could connect my lights to this and then
you can say like okay friendly mr.
Google thing turn the lights on and then
it will do it
we'll see figure that out try to make
things easier for Jim now double
checking my sale over in Amazon
currently unavailable is this device so
maybe it was end-of-life maybe that's
why it was on such a good deal I'm not
not available a lot of stock
it looks like the lowest price it was
was about what I bought it for which was
$26 each normally selling for $30 they
cranked it back up to 36 and now they're
just gone so there's your history by the
way this is camel camel camel and you
can take any Amazon order any Amazon
product page and plug it in there and
it'll tell you the pricing history for
it and it's a great way to tell am i
getting a good deal or did they jack the
price up on this
weeks ago in order to tell me I was
getting a good deal next up is a small
package shoot from Best Buy and Black
Friday Cyber Monday great time to get
deals on memory cards and completely
mistaken Wow
is it the most ineffective use of my
Spyderco I think ever right there let's
try that again just making a mess ha
SanDisk Extreme plus 128 gig a little
micro SD card micro SDXC kit compatible
with 4k Ultra HD its class 3 card so
this is just more memory I've got a
couple 256 gig memory cards but this
being micro sd means it'll work very
well with small devices like GoPro and
that kind of thing so yeah it was a good
deal and I don't remember how much I
paid for it I had to do some research
but now that I've realized that not
everything I bought was from Amazon this
was $50 at Best Buy same prices that
snipped down to on Amazon but um 65 is
what it's at NASA I'd say that's it it's
a reasonably good deal next up is this
package which came from performance pcs
and this was not necessarily a like a
Black Friday deal this is just stuff
that I needed that I happen to order at
the same time so um and here we have
some peanuts this look like the edible
packing peanuts
alright and I am actually really happy
about this arriving because and for mole
things in here they're stapled together
these are the hole reducers they come
from phobia and they are 3/8 to be 1/4
reducers so this way I can take these
screw them into the fill ports that I
have an Arctic Panther back there which
you can't see cuz the Dalton Meyer is
blocking it and actually use those to
connect up to the
which I am wanting to do because I want
to do a flush of that system and take a
look at how the view coolants has been
doing in there and now I can actually do
this in the fashion that I intended to
it's definitely way too long to actually
go through and order those next up is
another thing from Amazon and this so
this is actually part of the deal that
came with what's in this box right here
so I'm gonna go ahead and open this
because I am expanding my capabilities
when it comes to video production with
disorder this is a business expense I
heard it with my business my business
card because I run a business and here
this is actually two separate orders to
get shipped together this was what I got
and then this was a separate order so
I'll come back to this in just a second
so the rx100 mark 5 basically I have a
small handheld camera that I use when
I'm on the go and I need to get
close-ups of stuff that's what Joe's
using right now it's when the x100
really nice little camera had its ferb i
want to see for years now though it's
got a lot of use it's getting some dust
in the housing and stuff like that so I
wanted something that was a little bit
more portable and the rx100 mark 5 was
the answer to that one
Kyle's actually already got one of these
and it's nice just because it's so tiny
and it is so compact and it also gets
really good video even the sound isn't
bad at all and the 4k is slightly
limited with this camera by the fact
that it heats up so if you want to
record a really long 4k clip don't want
to do it with this camera it will shut
down after a little bit but beyond that
it's got everything that I that I want
when it comes to a portable camera so
I'm happy about that
oh and the really nice thing is the flip
up LCD so if I'm doing selfies or just
vlogging which I tend to do a little bit
more now these days
than I used to you can flip that up and
get
give yourself so this one again not a
crazy deal because this is still a
relatively new product and they weren't
being significantly marked down but I
got it for 900 and then also came with a
$50 Amazon gift card so here's the
actual product page on Amazon currently
selling for nine hundred and fifty
dollars and if we double check that over
on Campbell Campbell Kimmel
it looks like the lowest price had ever
dropped down to was eight hundred eighty
eight dollars at least on Amazon and so
getting it for nine hundred plus 50 dog
gift card I'm happy with that too this
this is actually going to be a gift for
my wife so I'm not gonna open it right
now I'm gonna leave this for her to open
but this is a dash cam the event route
dash cam end to records in front of you
as well as behind you records in 1080 is
for ya 1080 on the front cam and 720 on
the back cam and this is just one of
those things where I've done a fair
amount of traveling like in Taiwan
because I want every single car has one
of these in it and if you're ever in an
accident or something like that it's
just super nice to have to be able to
say here's the video but exactly what
happened so my wife has a Subaru and I
think this will be good to have in her
car because she commutes and drives
every day so this normally sells for
about a hundred and it looks like it's
gone for one hundred and seventy dollars
right now if you buy it directly from
Amazon and this one has dipped down a
little bit looks like it's dipped down
to about a hundred and fifty dollars
this was a deal I actually found on
slick deals had a promo code that
knocked us about sixty two dollars off
the price so it was about a hundred
dollars and then I used to get card on
it as well so that was cool all right we
are out of small things we need to move
up to larger things God starting with
this cyber power-ups UPS is super super
nice to have very convenient I did a
video on these last year well it was
about underappreciated or underrated PC
accessories and if you have a PC and
your PC is good and you like it and you
don't have a UPS maybe consider one as
your next investment because especially
if you live anywhere where the power is
a concern if you ever have brownouts or
blackouts
or if you simply live in a house or an
apartment that's shares power with other
people and other people like turn on
hair dryers or heaters or whatever and
your paradise then a UPS is really
really nice to have Black Friday is a
time when you can get them pretty
significantly reduced in price so I
actually bought one of these last year
this unit normally goes for about 170
dollars I got it for 120 and I bought
the one last year to go out here but
then the UPS that I had had that I've
been using for I don't know six seven
eight years and it back in the computer
room diet so I ended up using the one I
got last year in the computer room so
now this one is trapped in the garage
and for live streaming good if you're
live streaming and your power goes out
you might lose internet too so that
might not help you but for stuff like
that anytime using computer and what are
you ps4 there's really not a whole lot
to like show from these things it's got
the plastic all over it still I'll take
that out very soon I'm gonna be doing
some setup out here for our upcoming
charity livestream event and I'm
definitely gonna be implementing this
but it comes with several cable so you
can plug it in so you can do surge
protection for your phone lines and for
a coaxial connection for your network if
that's the if that's something that you
used and this is a 900 watt unit and
here I'm actually super excited because
I'm seeing that I got a really good deal
in this $215 is what it is selling for
right now this is the 900 watt version
available in lower power capacities if
you don't need to backup multiple
computers for example but this was 120
dollars on the Black Friday deal
normally 215 and looks like 120 which
was just last week
it was the lowest price that it has ever
been so that's the beauty of camel camel
camel you can can really be like yeah
confirms I got a good deal so excited to
loop this one into our setup right here
and lastly I have two monitors now I'm
going to talk a quick story here because
the monitor back here the dell 43 inch
4k monitor was a lightning deal for 650
dollars on amazon a crazy deal
and it was the lightning deal combined
with the video that Wendell did on it
where he was Ryan and they unbox it and
they took a look at it and everything
they were pretty impressed with it it's
not the best like color reproduction you
can get but for $650 per monitor that
size
it seems pretty good so I jumped on it I
was like I need that and then I wouldn't
measure my desk and I want to have two
monitors side-by-side but it's just way
too big it's not gonna fit so I ran it
by my wife I was like hey I got this big
monitor maybe you might be interested
because she likes to gaming stuff
she is so we're gonna try to use that as
a single monitor on her desk and of
course after I did that it was like well
I was all excited about a new 4k monitor
and I especially wanted to do two 4k
monitors on my desk so so I followed up
and got this this is an LG 4k monitor
this one was also very reasonably priced
this is 32 inches so it's the same size
as my existing Asus monitor which has
really good color reproduction it's 10
bit and everything this one was less
expensive so this one was I believe 380
dollars and I got this from B&amp;amp;H I found
it elsewhere no this was 370 I found it
elsewhere for 400 and then B&amp;amp;H had it
for 370 is like I gotta jump on that so
here goes the LG 3 2 UD v 9 32 inch
monitor reviews on this are also really
good it comes with like a nice
DisplayPort and HDMI cable and I gotta
tell you
4k 32 inch is like such a nice
combination of resolution and size
lightweight monitors are a lot easier to
mount on base amounts and that kind of
thing this does come with the stands
believe it's got height and so not
swivel or pivot not hate tilt swivel but
not fitted and probably want to pivot a
larger size anyway why so serious
there we go
big ass lge monitor 4k there 2 inch I
sure hope there are no dead pixels or
anything like that but we'll we'll test
that out in just a minute
it's got DisplayPort and two HDMI inputs
on the back and that's pretty much it's
like it's pretty pretty straightforward
on than that I think it's got a couple
speakers at the bottom but you know I
don't want to bother with the monitor
speakers usually anyway
yeah that's all I like it let's go old
mob down here to control the on screen
display good position for that this is
supposed to be a two-man lift
why don't I bring it up here this is a
bad idea
this is pretty much packaged like a like
a TV it's got these little latches in
the bottom and then that should
theoretically
guys I'm not going to do a full review
on this or anything I'll link to the
video that Wendell did in the video's
description but a crazy amount of nice
IO on the back including DisplayPort a
couple of those couple HDMI you also got
a pass-through for a USB 3.0 so public
comes with that then of course all the
cables it came with over here which
includes DisplayPort HDMI as well as a
nice so guys here's the actual product
page on Amazon you can see about this on
the 24th it's 750 dollars right now I
got it during a lightning sale for 650
dollars list price is 1200 and over on
camel camel camel we can see that it was
around the nine hundred dollar range for
quite a while has dipped down to being
available for 750 right now still seems
like pretty a deal but of course the
cheapest it was it's not even listed on
here I think due to the fact that it was
a lightning sale
perhaps but six hundred and fifty
dollars I'd say that's a pretty good
deal for a monitor this size of course
the question is will it fit I'm not sure
instead of picturing this is like one
large sixteen by nine monitor if you
think of it as like four 1080 monitors
maybe that might be slightly more
reasonable but guys that is all for this
video my crazy unboxing this has been my
haul for Black Friday and Cyber Monday
2017 and if you guys got some great
deals as well I'd love if you'd share
those down in the comments section down
below of course and especially if
there's any deals that are still ongoing
that you think are good before you post
those and share them with folks at home
I'll put links again to these products
down in the video's description just so
check them out down there if you want to
hit the thumbs-up button on your way out
if you enjoyed this video we'll see you
guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
