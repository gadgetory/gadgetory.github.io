is Matt's good posture and everything
yes
keep things shoulders bass crash oh I
should probably meet this I always feel
like I have worst posture when I tried
to have good posture like I feel awkward
I feel like a robot
or I feel like I look too stiff I feel
like I feel like there's times when I've
been sitting at a computer like what
like what I was doing and doing here
like 15 minutes ago uh-huh
oh yes realized you're like how'd you do
it really trying to get something done I
was like like I was like trying to frame
the camera like Paul substrate and I'd
like reframing a transport yeah but
sorry hello everyone welcome hi twitch
viewers hello YouTube viewers this is
awesome hardware it's a live show we
talk about technology and my stream
every Tuesday evening at 5:30 p.m.
Pacific time to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware and at the very same time we
also stream to YouTube right now you're
watching the first half of episode
number 165 on my channel pulse hardware
and in maybe 30 40 minutes we will
switch over to Cal's half bit whit this
is a special show for a couple different
reasons one we both been traveling we
actually just flew back today from New
York I haven't even been home yet I came
straight here to the studio so I can do
live show and make more content I have
been home either
also we both we both came straight here
second thing reason it's a special show
is because it's Kyle's birthday it is
Kyle's birthday happy birthday pal I
thank you Paul I'm the big three oh yeah
thirty I know
thirty thirty I know I don't look a day
over 21 it's true so I imagine you're
probably gonna be hitting the sauce
pretty hard this evening that actually I
think last night was my last hoorah last
night was I I got I got way too hammered
Oh
to be fair we did see some old friends
and in the industry it's definitely I
got to celebrate with them hanging out
sometimes but it was too much
celebration there were too many good
times which led to a bunch of bad times
just a series of bad times this morning
and then this afternoon and then even
into the evening I won't go into gross
detail to spare all of you but down they
say two wrongs don't make a right but
too many good times can lead to the bad
time
that's absolutely true
it's probably word words of wisdom that
you learn after you turn 30 yeah yeah I
mean I'm older than 30 yeah yeah super
wise so everyone happy birthday to Kyle
and also we're not gonna be drinking
quite as much today also to celebrate
Kyle's birthday the second half of the
show and his switch to his channel is
going to be the after party yes so
that'll be fun so if you guys are asking
questions it's all I can handle on
YouTube chat or anything will answer
them there and we'll also go over people
who have bought stuff on our stores
speaking of our stores check out our
stores and buy stuff - Fiona buy stuff
it's really nice and good and help
support us in you get merchandise and
it's super cool bit wit dot tex lash
stores Cal store shown right here now
available heather gray CPU cooler
lightweight hoodies and flash bios
t-shirts such as this one right here
yeah a late weight that is sexy my store
is pulsar Burnett I don't have any new
stuff right now but I am working on some
new stuff so that's all I have to say
about that I got to see you sneak peek
it looks good yeah yeah I show Kyle so
improve yeah we're gonna we're gonna try
to have a few more merch options for you
coming up in these months leading up to
the holidays it's obviously I'm gonna
capitalize on people spending money oh
yeah but yeah thanks all you guys who
helped support our stores and we're
gonna dive right into the news if you
guys are wondering why we're in we were
in New York we were actually invited
there by Intel because they held an
event yesterday where they officially
formally announced their new series of
desktop processors actually announced a
little bit more than we were I think
initially expecting them to announce
although it makes sense like the 28 core
thing the 31 75 WX right yeah like that
that's the one that they teased at
Computex running at 5 gigahertz but
didn't show the cooling unit that was
using at the time and that became a big
controversy more on controversies in
just a few minutes but they promised
that by the end of the year so I was
kind of think you know if that's coming
out by the end of the year they're gonna
need to talk about a little bit and yes
they did they at least gave a little bit
of info on that keep going we're saying
it's slightly out of focus
I'm a mouse in the wrong place which
makes this challenging also I have not
clicked on any of these stories to bring
up and discuss which I should I should
usually I have this done before well
anyway as far as their announcements on
the mainstream side we have three new
processors coming out and we also have a
new series of motherboards good news the
motherboards which is e 390 chipset are
still the same LGA 1151 socket and they
are still going to be backwards and
forwards compatible with last gen8 8000
series processors the coffee-like
original copy like yes and now we have
copy like refresh I guess is what the
9000 processors are thinking so jet of
AMD's books yes so if you have a Z 370
motherboard and this is well this will
be up to your motherboard manufacturer
but we from our understanding most of
the Z 370 motherboards will have BIOS
updates that will allow you to slot in
these new processors and of course if
you buy one of these new motherboards
they're backwards compatible with 8000
series processors and who knows in 8700
K on discount might be a reasonable
comparison to something like a 9700 K
because the 9600 K and 9700 K do not
have hyper threading that's true and
even though even though they're I 7
parts so it'll be cool to compare those
to the 8700 k 8600 k so links to stuff
we're talking about as far as articles
that we're looking at are all done in
the description if you guys want to
follow along also our wonderful
moderator cell frequently post those in
chat so thanks to excel for doing that
thanks for moderating our stuff -
there's a look at the retail packaging
we kind of teased this in the live show
last week because there was a retail
retail listing that went out for it
but we were actually able to see it
there I didn't get close up and hands-on
with it but um it I mean it looks it
looks fancier than their packaging they
had done before so this is clearly a
response to AMD who has gotten fancier
with their packaging for like their
thread Ripper processors and stuff so
Intel wants us to stand out and so on
and so forth so there's the hyper
starting thing although the 9900 case go
Duke
to five gigahertz if we're looking
strictly this is a long article I'm
trying to get him trying to get down to
the that's the whole event right there
there it is all right here's the three
new processors so the 9900 K is eight
cores and 16 threads and the price and
this is the price for a thousand of them
by the way is four hundred and
eighty-eight dollars not a thousand four
488 yeah if you buy a thousand but if
you buy a thousand four 488 for each
processor four hundred eighty eight
thousand dollars so if you had four
hundred eighty eight thousand dollars
you can buy a thousand of them at this
price what a saving the actual pre-sales
which are up now which we're not
recommending anybody do don't don't buy
don't pre-order these they're selling
for like five hundred and twenty five
hundred and twenty five I think
the pre-orders and Newegg we're going
for more you buy the more you save
though that's that's but taking away
from this quote Jensen mister gen 9700
k-8 core 8 thread again 374 dollars it's
gonna be a big a big question as far as
the existing 6-quart well thread
processors versus an eight core a thread
processor yeah which which do you go
with there our expectation when it comes
to performance of these is that they
will be better because they are faster
intel has switched to soldered Tim
they're calling it stim which reminds me
of a simple I can like it start
Starcraft and almost at start with my
name i soldered tim which which they
which is right because they they gave us
this presentation and they're like we
have this new soldered thermal interface
material that's not new like remember
the 2500 k you know the center k those
are really good overclockers because
they had they were soldered and they
really good temperature you so yeah it's
something that they phased out for cost
purposes it created a whole market of
deleting and stuff but i'd rather they
just came soldered yeah of course
they're probably still gonna people be
people who delayed and like test the
solder to be like make sure that's
really good solder but um it seems like
it will be because the chips are already
reaching reaching much higher clock
speeds beyond though
new skews though we also have a high-end
desktop refresh coming at you as well
these will apparently slot into existing
X 399 I'm sorry X 299 motherboards so
Intel's current high-end desktop
platform we just have a whole new set of
processors there is the picture of a
slide showing all of them you know Intel
set sent out the slideshow yesterday so
you can probably get a PC where it
should update this with high resolution
but they do it they did list all the
prices they're still very expensive it
still only goes up to 18 core 36 thread
these are probably really just the same
the same processors they're just
soldered and so they're gonna air clocks
gonna have higher clock speeds we did so
again the other thing about this is that
they didn't seem to post it to have any
launch date for these strikes again they
didn't seem devonee's set launch date
for these the for the 28 core which is
going to be on a super high-end platform
which is going to be used these
motherboards LG at 36 47 and we already
got a brief look at this one at Computex
this was what they ran that demo on as
far as we can tell it looks pretty much
exactly the same builds lloyd did a
breakdown of this where he talked about
the power delivery and everything back
at the Computex time period this one is
from asus and it is a completely new
line because they're calling it the rog
dominus extreme if you wanted to have a
criticism right out of the gate it would
probably be something along the lines of
rog as republic of gamers and until it
was clearly listening these not they're
clearly trying to differentiate these
from the gaming oriented or even the
cross like multi-use like like the
high-end desktop X 299 stuff is is
supposed to be create for creators you
know a multi-use you can use it for
gaming you can also use it for the stuff
that all the all the core
high court count is used useful for so
this one is actually like ROG but it's
it's still this crazy massive
motherboard dual eight pin power can
dual eight pain power connectors plus
the six pin on either side
that's for eight-penny PS plus a
pin on either side of that there's
another six pin tucked in right down
here on the bottom which is probably for
the PCIe lanes dual 24-pin power
connectors look I love like all these
banks of like fan headers and there's
like a crap ton more down here this is a
pretty insane board when you look at
everything that's in it I'm not sure
what the what the form factor is it's
probably like SSI CEB or one of these
one of those server form factors but
obviously these CPUs since they will be
unlocked for overclocking are probably
going to be capable of pulling just
massive massive amounts of power because
already with like the 18 core
overclocked you know you can get up to
where you're drawing six seven hundred
Watts just from the CPU I bet we're
gonna see a huge spike in sales for
those fantex power combos oh yeah the
high end high embarrassed why I don't
let you analyze to to connect to a
single system yeah so anyway that's the
Dominus extreme that is for the 31 75 W
which is an unlock Zeon they're still
calling it Zeon they haven't set a price
for that we were speculating what the
price might be it seems like they have
confirmed that it's probably going to be
sub $5,000 which is cool because the
twenty eight cores Ian sells for like
eight to ten grand
so if you look at it that way that's a
that's a it's good that it's it's good
that it's less than five thousand I
guess I'm not pricing yeah that that
cheaper pricing and the fact that we're
getting an rog board here makes it seem
like this Xeon in particular is like
kind of a stopgap between the high end
desktop platforming like the the true
Zeon's and stuff yeah but we'll see yeah
so that's that's kind of cool
the W 3175 x come in come in in december
so i have no idea if they will do any
sampling for that or anything that
boards well but getting back to the the
more reasonable LGA 2066 ii here's the
whole products that going from about two
grand all the way down to $600 for a
9800 X the thing I really liked about
this product stack that they listed was
you'll notice it stops at eight core
eight core sixteen thread they did not
attempt to redo
77 yeah 77 40 I don't even remember
I think they stupid quad-core that they
put on the high-end desktop platform
which was not a good present because
then the 9900 Cawood would beat it out
yeah most definitely
beyond all them processors of course is
the new motherboards of this ether 90
chipset and those are primarily bringing
the Z 370 chipset up to speed because
the Z 370 chipset and in my opinion a
lot of the reviewers opinions was rushed
didn't include the next-gen features
such as 802 that 11 AC Wi-Fi and USB 3.1
gen2 Z 390 supports 6 3.1 gen2
connections 10 USB 3.0 support for 6 gen
2 USB 3.1 connections ok 10 Gen 1 USB
3.1 lanes I that's Gen 1 all right
that's that's USB 3 and then also until
8 o 2.11 AC Wi-Fi so let's USB
connectivity so that's cool also still
maintains the same PCIe connectivity
Intel still likes to put that there's 40
PCIe lanes available on this main stream
platform which excuse me sorry I still
find to be fairly misleading interest
one 24 of those PCIe lanes come from the
PCH the platform actual hub which is
part of the chipset and that's basically
a switch what you really have on the CPU
is 16 lanes for your PCI Express slots
that can be divided into different ways
and those all can also often be routed
over to like MDOT two slots for direct
connection and then the PCH which is
really for PCIe lanes multiplexed out to
24 so it's not like you have 24 more
PCIe lanes you can't use them all
simultaneously same time you can use
them to connect up a bunch of different
devices but for instance like I did them
boxing of the msi z3 90 Meg god-like
motherboard and that has three MDOT two
slots on it including a riser card they
give you for two more m2 slots and as
well as I think a u dot two and it's
just like you know you're gonna there's
a trade-off there you're not going to be
able to use like SLI or
or envy link and then also all those I'm
about to you have to pick and choose if
you really want that much connectivity
you gotta go up to the high end but
controversy right we always when every
time it seems like we go to some of
these events these days like Steve's
from gamers Nexus gets really pissed off
at something and there's controversy now
to be fair it's not always Steve but
there's just there are always seems to
be something that comes up and it wasn't
until kind of later last night that an
article was published by PC games end
comm and we've referenced some of their
articles here before I'm not familiar
with any of the actual people who or who
write for PC games and but they picked
up a some information that was shared on
an Intel blog post on the Intel newsroom
blog where they post stuff about Intel
and this was about a set of benchmarks
that were published yesterday on the
Intel newsroom blog and these benchmarks
were commissioned by Intel to be run by
an independent third party who but they
were they were paid and help paid them
to run these sets of benchmarks and the
third party is called principled
technologies which is a company based in
Durham North Carolina according to their
website they are an industry-leading
technology assessment fact-based
marketing services hands-on testing of
technology products deliver the facts
testing reports and videos that's from
their website metadata so that's why
it's not actually a complete sentence
but I'm point being I started getting
into a little bit of conversation last
night was tonight with Steve from gamers
Nexus as well as Steve from Hardware
unbox this was first brought to my
attention by Steve from Hardware unboxed
and there is an article on tech spot
that he wrote that goes over this
there's also a video on this that he
published and it's essentially taking a
close look at these benchmarks that were
posted by by Principal technologies I
should point out the PC games end has
since updated their article on this and
they have included some of Steve's
information from it and his article
about their testing methodology and and
there's multiple reasons why this
is something that we as reviewers are
not super excited about but also a lot
of people who were following the this
the launch and this news in general
aren't really stoked on either
double-whammy lots of reasons so we're
not happy because of course this was
commissioned and paid for by Intel and
it's comparing ninety nine hundred K
performance to a bunch of different
other processors this is the actual PDF
that they published from principal
technologies on the plus side they're
very thorough about their testing
methodology on the minus side that has
allowed both the both of our Steve's and
quite a few others of us who were sort
of disgusting this over the last night
and stuff to sort of point out a lot of
the shortcomings now they tested the
2950 WX the twenty nine ninety WX and
the twenty seven hundred X from the AMD
side and they compared that to the
ninety nine hundred K the new eight core
sixteen thread processor and also the
eighty seven or decay 8086 X as well as
the ninety nine eighty XE which isn't
coming out for probably another one to
two months ninety nine hundred X and
then they go through a bunch of
different games something like 19 games
tested they're all listed here including
Warhammer csgo sub 6 GTA 5 and then
there's just there's a very long list of
numbers here that they have published
now looking at it from a reviewers
perspective we are we are under NDA we
can say that now because the initial
announcement has happened and we are
probably going to be receiving
processors that we will test and you
know make some sort of video content
about or written the written guys will
do written content about and publish we
we can't publish that information for
another like nine ten days this
information is out there and you know
anyone who reads this information some
people are more savvy than others some
people might read this information and
just accept it and be like wow that's
pretty nice other people might um you
know
with a little bit more skepticism but
for instance the article published by PC
games and headline was did it say
Intel's car I $9.99 hundred K is up to
50% faster than AMD's risin 7 2,700 X
and games which is that's so much sleep
that's yeah irresponsible and I don't so
hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna quickly
linky over here ah all right so now the
headline has been updated - so good on
you PC games then for updating this
which is what they should have done sure
now the initial article was somewhat
misleading - again this really isn't
about PC games n-no this is this is more
about this is more about the actual
commissioned report and that sort of
thing so don't want it's well on that
but yeah so people have this and have a
very limited amount of information when
it comes to actual benchmarks that have
been published because most people
aren't allowed to publish them and this
information is obviously clearly
misleading other stuff that's been
pointed up by Steve and others the 2700
X in their tests was tested with the
stock Wraiths
cooler whereas all the other CPUs and
the tests were tested with a Noctua and
HD 14s which is an aftermarket cooler
which it's not not good I think testing
methodology they've used varying
motherboard brands and often between
very motherboard brands when it comes to
stuff like memory timings stuff can
change from platform to platform that's
some weird configurations like where
they were throwing 64 gigs at certain
certain test beds at 8 different test
beds running the ran according to them
they did all of this testing on October
4th on a single day which is possible if
you're running multiple test beds for
running multiple test beds introduces
additional variants into the tests which
makes them less reliable unless you're
running many many many tests other
things were they reference the median
results instead of the the average of
the mean which is sort of a strange
thing
average is taking all the results and
then multiplying them by the number of
the results the median is is taking the
number of the results in choosing the
middle one yeah
which is not an average which is useful
for certain things but not it's
definitely not the typical way that the
PC bench PC gaming game benchmarking
goes they also use Final Fantasy 15
which has been pointed out by many
people to be not a good benchmark for
varying reasons you you not Ubisoft who
develops novel fancy anyway the
developer came out in the Britax
yeah Square Enix they came out and
apologized for it
referencing the gta5 methodology because
they again they're very specific with
their methodology which I do appreciate
they went into every game and said not
just the settings they use but like how
they did the settings but that points to
a possibility of GTA 5 settings changing
between Hardware swaps because GTA 5 is
really annoying at doing that also and
this is a little bit more recent Steve's
so Steve posted his oh wait now Steve
from gamer from Hardware from Hardware
unboxed posted his original video going
over all this stuff and when a like one
of the most damning things in this
entire thing is probably going to be the
ashes of the singularity test right here
because you can see they're paid result
for the 8700 K getting about 49 fps and
then you can see Steve's test for the
rise in 720 700 X getting around 45 46
their tests getting around 38 that's it
that's a pretty significant drop-off and
this is actually the test that was
referenced in that article headline
saying that it's 50% faster Steve
actually followed up after he got some
feedback from people post and after
posting that initial video saying that
the article also demonstrates that they
used game mode and rise in master
software if you're not familiar with
what game mode does games are very
latency sensitive sensitive and Rison
processors both the mainstream as well
as a thread ripper that's one of their
weak points because they have main rise
and processors have to CC X units each
one of those has four cores and there's
some latency between those turning on
game mode turns off one of those so it
improves latency but if it's a game that
would have used more than four cores or
more than a three
then you could potentially lose
performance so Steve button retested and
that's what the orange line here is and
this is on their patreon which I guess I
can view for free and it says Steve I
pay you money to pay Triana and he found
that the performance was even worse when
you have game mode on
so again just just seems to be lots of
points of contention with their testing
methodology and you know what if it was
day of launch right now and everyone was
posting their results right no one would
even notice this yeah but the fact that
Intel published it on their blog and and
the fact that it was commissioned by
them and the fact that it is really the
only like pretty thorough set of
benchmarks that you can actually look at
right now that are that are legitimate
as far as they are benchmarks that were
run not like somebody saying like hey
I've found this test that was uploaded
to the 3dmark database that has a nun
you know unknown hardware so you know
you know like that like the leaked
benchmarks it is they are real
benchmarks and some degree and the fact
that this released when pre-orders are
available some people like that sexual
real damage that's people now giving
money to Intel based on this singular
paid result yes
which like Paul said can't be refuted I
don't think it I don't even think it'd
be a big deal if like pre-orders weren't
open right now because people would just
look at this and there's no action to be
taken from it you know so shaving so
really if you guys were not in the loop
as far as the scandal with this launch
announcement this is pretty much it and
you know I it's stuff like this I feel
like has happened before to some degree
but I don't know I I don't know too much
about about the principled technologies
company but a few people who I asked
about it said the day they actually used
to work for and they've done work for
AMD before in the past but now they
often exclusively work for Intel they've
done other stuff too though because I
even just recently looked up and they
had like a video they did with Dell so
they work with various companies and I'm
sure the people there
have the I'm sure they're like good
people like morally and ethically and
everything internally but doesn't eat
bench markers yeah yeah so other things
to point out that there's disclaimers at
the end of the article specifically
disclaiming them of any what liability
you know that these numbers might be
accurate and accurate anything then what
at the end and I feel like I've seen
this language before it says software
and workloads used in performance tests
may have been optimized for performance
only on Intel micro processors I feel
like I've seen that exact language
before it seems pretty like oh so you
mean this whole set of benchmark tests
that you run and then that's very end oh
and by the way all the software was
optimized for the team that paid us yeah
true to form true to form Steve from
gamers Nexus has also posted a video
titled Intel's gross gross incompetence
super III watched this earlier today as
I was kind of preparing for the show
Steve filmed this last night after he
flew home and Steve and I know you're
watching now but you seem a little loopy
in this video well he's a little loopy
he gets he gets exasperated though and
and and and that's fun and stuff so
fired up passion now something else that
when I oh look I'm created getting Steve
freeze frames drooping his face down
that's like his face is melting he's
melting his face with his fingers that's
what it looks like great keep doing it I
mean can you just print skin really
quick somebody some twitch clip it yeah
but we we have some I don't know if this
is exclusive or not we're so we're
supposed to get Steve on the phone here
at some point
oh he's watching right now so cool hey
Steve we're gonna call Steve in just a
minute here because he actually went and
visited them today the the principle
technologies place because he's in North
Carolina industry they're in North
Carolina he went in and visited them so
we're gonna talk to him
in just a minute here once I saved this
screenshot so he's going to give us I'm
guessing something like a preview of his
interaction with them yeah his interview
with them so and let me let me double
check if they have actually posted this
yes yet they did a full interview with
them and they are gonna post the whole
thing on uncut but it's probably it's
probably still uploading like right now
so we'll give a little but you guys will
get a little bit of a preview as we
hopefully get Steve on the phone here
and he does say he's watching so let me
give let me give him a call Steve Burke
of gamers Nexus friend of the show yep I
should probably put this on speaker -
all right what if you go ahead no
administers - straight to voicemail
shoot Steve yes hi Steve it's Paul and
Kyle and Kyle good how are you guys in
chat if you it is Kyle's Bert something
like that did you want to say anything
you have a special birthday message
thank you Steve hold on I need to update
this I made a special lower thirds just
for Steve that's why we were like 20
minutes late just for that behold behold
our great Network all right so so Steve
obviously you're gonna you're gonna be
posting it full uncut you said footage
of your discussion with principal
technologies about this about this
report that they published I guess are
there any highlights or like Kenny can
you walk us through the experience they
had there any watched your
video so yeah I mean I kind of had that
same sort of mixed feelings going over
the PDF about it because like I
mentioned a few times like they were
pretty thorough in going over what they
did and not everyone does that and and I
feel like they they could have
potentially obfuscated that more but
then there's also the question of like
they're commissioned to do this for
Intel like is do they have to do to be
that thorough to protect themselves in
case of like I have no idea if there are
any like SEC rules about this type of
thing or anything like that
but the thought has crossed my mind oh
yeah yeah that's I think that's the
first I think that's still the first
image that pops up on Google Images if
she I think now we're Paul and I are
both terrified of your next video
featuring either of us because I don't
want to see like what thumbnail you it's
a screaming cabbing Jeff from 2016 I
think
a mode while it benefits Red River where
some games Donnie would run with 64 or
32 everybody thread it actually goes on
benefit there are 27 acknowledged their
research and more students realize they
should not have enabled game mode for
the nonce Red River cards yeah make it a
factory it ok talk about deadlines and
having to publish at some point but
you're finished will be as accurate as
Academy are you should be cutting stuff
out in are confident in it yeah did he
ever mention like what might be done
with with the current report
now that they've sort of admitted that
some things could have been tested a lot
more accurately ask why are you down we
asked what are the goals we're using
these settings there were a couple of
moments where I had kind of cornered the
co-founder with questions for example so
I use the Nhu 14 answer is positive the
jaws use up its credit for just when I
said okay that's not compatible with
[Laughter]
so I feel like the if the upshot here is
that it seems like like a and and to be
fair anyone who does reviews and anyone
who does benchmarking of PC hardware in
this way like there's there's the basics
and then there's all there's all of the
nuances there's all of the little
details and there's if you want to have
accurate tests comparing one product to
another you really need to have a good
handle on all of those little details
and all of the tiny things that might
change the outcome of testing results
and I feel like lots of people go
through that because you know I I still
learn things every time I go and do a
set of testing but somebody who is kind
of like the flagship first publication
like authorized by Intel probably
shouldn't be shouldn't have that level
of potential very answered or
things that weren't done properly when
you're comparing against alright well
Steve we're gonna let you go I think we
need to switch over to second half of
the show pretty quick here but thank you
very much for joining us thank you sir
and hopefully ya see it the next next
big event with the scandal at the end of
it okay cool all right guys that was
Steve subscribe gamers Lexus yeah gave
us that interview it's gonna be sweet
gamers nexus net as a website for
written stuff and then gamers Nexus of
course on YouTube too
alright that's pretty much all I got
from my half of the show guys again
we're gonna jump to kyle staff oh wait
no we have we have one other thing we
need to do really quick oh yes can't
forget that
where you go we we need this is a job we
didn't even need money so occasionally
money occasionally we'll do a sponsor
spot today's sponsor spot is brought to
you by Toshiba specifically her SSDs
we've got the OC OC Z which is the sort
of sub brand here TR 200 just a standard
two and a half inch SATA base to say the
Rev three very reliable very dependable
pretty much standard SATA 3 base speeds
normally the box isn't squished like
this but I had to travel with a GPS
actually that like the Box when I got
the that I got these in there Toshiba
sent them over to me so we could have
them for our sponsor spot and like the
box was mangled I suppose because I
actually took pictures of it before I
open it because I was worried this stuff
had had come out I wasn't gonna have
everything that was in there damn anyway
this is all based on their BICS flash
memory which is both fast and also
inexpensive or relatively inexpensive so
you will find these SSDs based on that
technology to be a nice variance of both
of those they also the super tiny little
guy right there
RC 100 RC 100 and then up to 480
capacity in just this tiny channel m dot
222 was at 22 42 oh yeah yeah 22:42
yeah so for a very smart small
form-factor builds something like that
it's also the XS 700 which is in a
external SSD with USB type-c as well as
USB 3.1 gen2 support gives you lots of
bandwidth rock paper scissors to see who
keeps that one indeed I can always use
external storage and then of course
standard 2.5 inch SSDs available in the
TR 200 series so check out Toshiba the
isis BICS flash-based SSDs I'm gonna add
links to all that in my description and
within like the next five minutes or so
yeah I mean I'm gonna probably detect it
there you just copy my for sure for sure
me too dad alright and that is gonna
wrap it up for my half of the show so
thank you guys so much for watching the
first half of Austin Hardware up so 165
thanks again to our special guest Steve
from gamers Nexus ready cut this off
there is a link in the description to
kyle staff of the show
there should be yes I don't know do that
did I do that properly I don't know did
