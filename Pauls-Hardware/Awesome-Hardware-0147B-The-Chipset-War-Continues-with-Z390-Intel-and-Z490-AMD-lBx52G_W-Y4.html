probably live like right now or maybe a
second ago or maybe right now or now
it's really hard to gauge exactly when
you go live
although YouTube actually has a solution
for that now you can start streaming and
then click the button on the thing to go
live you're not fancy enough to actually
use that no we're not even partnered
we're not but hello everyone and welcome
to awesome hardware this is a live show
we talked about technology we drink some
beer occasionally we use adult language
so if you have young ones around or if
you're easily offended then this might
not be the show for you but we try to
keep things classy for the most part so
yeah we already did the first half of
today's show which is episode number 147
of awesome hardware and we streamed out
on Kyle's channel we got which is bit
wit and that's linked in the video
description so if you haven't watched
that you maybe should go and watch that
because we talked about things and we
played games and we learned more about
who we are as people and you as the
audience and I think there was some my
little pony involved at some point it's
very existential is intriguing yeah um
and vaguely erotic so check that out
it's linked in the description in the
meantime though if you're continuing to
watch the second half side B of episode
147 thank you for joining us juice and
Cheers mmm Cal's finishing out the
Speedway stuff that we drank on Kyle's
after the show moving on to a green man
Rambler dry hopped Pale Ale which comes
courtesy of one of our fans who deliver
this to us in it yeah we do so we unbox
these last week in the mail time and I
don't believe there was any I couldn't
find any note or anything they were it
was like ordered somewhere else is it
anonymous yeah so I mean maybe not
intentionally but but perhaps us from
Silence brewing tenderloin in Asheville
North Carolina right soon as this first
room so I'm drinking st. Teresa's Pale
Ale right there
and Kyle's gots green man Rambler Palin
green man Rambler so a a hearty cheers
to the wonderful fan who set these over
to us it's got a three-point I just
looked it up they've got a 3.8 on Beer
Advocate which means it's a pretty
decent beer hey solid Cheers solid she's
all again okay oh yeah that's good
if you enjoy our shows and wanna help
support us and you want to get some
merch at the same time check out our
stores do it do it you buy stuff during
the show we need to point out we didn't
yes we didn't shout out names at the end
of Kyle's half-sari
will do all of them at the end of my
half of the show you will be
acknowledged will shut those up we're
gonna we're gonna play games at the end
of my half so that's gonna be fun
yeah but my store is Paul's heart
Barnett's go there and buy things I've
got thumbscrew logos on lots of stuff
shirts mugs pint glasses bottle openers
it's all real high quality and you will
be happy with it I guarantee you can
also buy stuff from Kyle's store which
is bit wit tech slash store he also has
added bottle openers because he saw how
lucrative my sales were for the bottle
openers available with my CPU cooler and
the evolution design also the new ripp
gamepad design rouge has recently been
just everyone's been talking about it
it's the latest craze yes and we'll shut
Johnson Etsy at the end of the show
indeed if you buy it so thanks to all
you guys who helped support us in that
way and really hope you enjoy the merch
do we accept paypal we do oh yes you can
order with PayPal PayPal and major
credit cards accepted we do
International shipping I'm sorry that
the International shipping is expensive
tends to be expensive that's just how it
was a smaller Vermont our John is is our
guy who does all that stuff right and
he's super awesome
yes he does he does stuff for gamers
Nexus - he makes their their merch their
mod met but gamers Nexus because they're
super like cuz Steve is so hands-on he'd
like I believe gamers Nexus does
the actual sales and distribution that's
pretty impressive
yeah I have no idea that's crazy them
yeah they have like a big inventory they
have to ship out you get him on Matt I
did you did really I got a Matt Matt to
the mod Matt's really really nice super
nice really cool product and I'm pretty
sure Steve's like box those up and ship
them himself
that's pretty impressive why does he
even need John look all John actually
pretty like you can see shirts and
everything yes and it's good stuff like
it but John eyes I got it I shouldn't
even be talking about this I haven't
talked to Steve or John I don't know
this for sure
Paul's corner a new segment Paul
speculates the new segment from Paul's
hardware go Steve no no you're going
everybody get this in that store it's
not shipping from John I'm pretty sure
that sounds good anyway gamers Nexus
also has products so go to gamers Nexus
and buy their stuff too yeah Kyle and I
both got their mod Matt recently which
is a really cool product big ass to you
Matt that you can very local build on
and it's got a bunch of helpful
information printed on it as well as a
anti-static contact point it's like a
rug for your PC building area it's great
it's super sweet thank you agree
let us continue with the tech news
because that's really what that's really
what it's all about we talked about
sorry so's nose nice thank you thank you
we begin the tech news segment as always
with it yes that's it I'm hurting
already
okay all right so we talked a bit on
Kyle's half of the show about Intel's
plans for new ultra high-end
motherboards but not super high in other
words because that would be high-end
desktop motherboards but kind of like
really in between motherboards but super
high-end if you're not talking about the
high-end desktop stuff which would be
the z3 90 chipset yeah apparently AMD's
also kind of doing the same thing
AMD's been really good good
quote-unquote doing that down depending
on your view of good and with with names
of chips that's being confusing whether
that's good or bad but AMD has been
trolling Intel yet their chipset name
time for example I don't like it
AMD was pretty sure that Intel with
their launch of X 299 as the high-end
desktop chipset for their high-end
platform you know their their processors
and stuff going all the way up to 8 10
12 14 and 16 and 18 cores they knew it
was going to be X 299 mm-hmm
so when AMD launched thread Ripper X 399
so whenever Intel decides to make the
successor to X 299 well they can't just
make it X 399 can't they can they
because AMD already took a - accepted
and as funny as that might be like lol
it's not so freaking confusing because
now you have to explain to people where
as you might be able to have had some
sort of logical sequence of like well
the head X 99 whoa and then they were
like X 199 would sounds stupid so they
would text 299 and then after that of
course they went to X 499 look whatever
what are they gonna do are they gonna
completely change the name I'm I'm
really not sure but I don't know if the
logic is stupid but the lot like you
have to realign like recalibrate your
logic like I think the way that I would
explain it to a newcomer to like the
high-end desktop scene would be like
alright so if like Intel's X 299 just
imagine that AMD is just one above that
with the first digit so AMD is always
like for every new generation AMD just
has the is just add a hundred just
attitude so like okay
a Intel's that X $5.99 more than a and
the equivalent AMD must be X 5 6 7 8 9 X
6 9
yes and obviously the hyoeun gonna be
having number the higher the number the
better quality and faster the product
right no cuz that's what as obviously it
means you have
that's that's the Asterix disclaimer
that you saw so add at the end we we
complained a bit I complained a bit I
think but I think people worsen
something of an agreement with me that
when Intel finally went from four cores
to six cores they decided we need a
whole new chipsets and need to force
people to buy new motherboards for this
because even though we're using the same
socket and even though we've seen people
hack 87.6 core 8700 KS in that and what
not into old Z 270 motherboards and get
them working like oh we need to redo
things and stuff maybe they had some
legitimacy to that there because of
power delivery configurations and
whatnot but point is you had to get and
you had to buy into a new platform the
300 series motherboards in order to get
a functional like coffee like 8700 K
processor to work Intel's now planning a
Z 390 chipset which will be better than
Z 370 and possibly even required for
they're possibly new upcoming 8 core
processor on the mainstream although
that's still rumored again more on that
Cal's half of the show but AMD for their
part is potentially again this is a
rumor want to clarify that potentially
working on AZ 490 chipset for themselves
why so this is this is all kind of all
kinds of messed up because why is it Z Y
Y Z Y confuse us further
why is he AMD why does it need to be Z
you have an X 370 chipset you have an X
470 chipset what's wrong with X 490 it
literally makes no sense other than the
only excuse that I could have for them
for that justification is that they're
trying to blur the lines between Intel
and AMD
yes so that it's very much trying to
model it because they are the underdogs
and they're trying to confuse people who
might be buying into one platform or
another right who don't even know that
Intel and AMD are the main players yeah
and they're who are just looking at
product names and numbers and getting
confused by them which doesn't seem
like it's a library it doesn't seem
worth the effort or hassle because most
people who are looking to buy a new
system or build a new system probably
already know that much they probably
already know like enough to be like okay
yeah AMD and Intel are different they
have different features different you
know sort of environments and stuff how
many people are they tricking with this
I mean how many what percentage of their
users are actually being fooled by their
weird nomenclature switch arisen I feel
like there's there's us who talk about
these things and there's you guys who
watch our show who are interested in
these things and to read up on them and
are you know familiar enough to know the
difference between this chip set and
that chip set but then there's a bunch
of people who just go to like Best Buy
and buy a computer having done zero
research apparently like I don't know I
don't know I don't know how big of a
market that is like go spend $1,000 on a
computer we build a Best Buy like that's
like I don't know I don't know not
unlike like let's build it like I feel
like the people who are willing to build
their own systems are at least willing
to do enough research to know the
difference between chipsets so so who
are they really fooling
if AMD's end goal is to really confuse
the end user to think that z-force 490
is better than z4 8 I don't understand
I'm even confused like it's so it's just
it's only confusing to be in business
well they know better there's there's
the use my points thing let's name it a
bigger number because people we see the
bigger number and assume it's better
there's the let's name it the sequential
number that the competition is using and
this is something that AMD has been
doing recently within with Intel let's
name it the competition sequential
number and I'm not sure if that's a
confused people the buying stuff or just
like hahahaha fuck you like I don't know
if that like I don't know what that
I don't know what I don't know you know
what the like when they make that
business decision in the in the meeting
of the people who make those decisions
at AMD I don't know what it boils them
to with that decision when they were
like we're gonna call this new chipset
x3 99 I don't know I don't know what it
was like obviously I would have to
assume it was like because people will
see x3 99 and I'll assume that better
than the next 299 that's probably what
it is but there's also some like like
yeah this is like fucking intro is this
there's there's a troll factor in there
too so yeah and and it could also be the
fact that Intel just generally overall
spends more marketing budget like they
have a bigger marketing budget and
they're able to push you know their
their agenda and their platform a lot
further than AMD can on in a mainstream
sense so maybe maybe consumers just
general people are seeing ads from Intel
nine times out of ten way more than they
see AMD ads and maybe that's just AMD's
way of piggybacking off of intel's
marketing where it's like let's have
Intel spend billions of dollars or
millions of dollars to advertise X to 99
and we'll just call our platform X 399
so when people Google X to an eighteen
platform marsh it pops up and they
immediately think ours is better like so
there's probably some of that going on
but let's I don't know let's let's let's
actually scroll down into the article
and where this is actually sourced from
so and easy for ninety is a new rumored
chipset that would be better than X 470
so right now if you're on the AMD rising
platform you probably have a 300 series
motherboard which would be a B 350 or X
370 launching in two days on the 19th is
going to be the 400 series of
motherboards B actually there's no B 450
I think that's actually launching I
think just X 470 launching as of right
now but you see 490 would be up here at
the top this is actually sourced from
a gigabyte Oris slide deck so that's
where the leak comes from again this is
rumored but seems to be if it's from a
gigabyte or a slide deck that would have
some legitimacy as far as a product that
they are planning in the future the the
basic difference if you're like is what
what's the difference between X 470 and
Z 490 is you get four more PCI Express
Lanes for more PCIe gen3 lanes then you
get with X 470 that's really the
fundamental difference at least
according to this article and leaks it
that's it now that's not insignificant
as far as the difference goes because
you can take for pcie 3.0 lanes even a
DME driver so you can make another m dot
2 slot for an nvme drive you could add a
10 gigabit ethernet port you could add
Thunderbolt 3 which I guess is royalty
free now that's nice you could also add
more USB 3.1 or SATA ports it gives more
connectivity now they can't magically
make more connectivity from the CPU
itself so this is probably something
like a multiplex like like a there it's
a it's a switch effectively it's a
fancier switch built into the chipset
that's that adds more connectivity so
you're not suddenly going to be able to
take like if you had one I'm about to
drive running at max speed before you're
not gonna be able to add a second one
and raid them together and suddenly get
the full throughput of both of those
right but you have the connectivity
there and sense drives usually aren't
you depend access individually at the
same rate unless they're in raid then
then it's still it's still a nice
feature to have but this is still just a
rumor
so we'll see if it actually comes true
and we'll also have to wait and see what
happens with the potential Intel Z 370
I'm sorry Z 390 stuff and we'll also
have to be freaking confused by all
these freaking chipset names because
they are so similar and help us all we
at least had the Z&amp;amp;X separation but I
know and now it's like no there's no it
wasn't even that good a separation in
Michael X
um indeed a mainstream yeah AMD and I'm
sorry Z is that AMD mainstream and into
a high-end desktop Z until you get 10
tight yeah right whatever high-end
versus mainstream moving at here's an
article from TechRadar rising to of
course we already said launching on
April 19th in a couple days
these 2700 X and 2600 X have been
confirmed by AMD a lot of the specs just
went out late last week
yeah within the embalmer an unboxing
embargo launch I didn't do an unboxing
you didn't know by choice no I was a
principal was based on principle I was
like you know these box these unboxings
there's they're just answer peer cancer
they're just the manufacturer taking
advantage of us of us influencers to
taint our influence with these easy
unboxing videos and it's just too easy
it's a trap it's clearly a trap
yeah III know I benefit greatly from it
they benefit more so if I'm being honest
wise I went to New York and that ate up
a decent chunk of my time last week
because that was an AMD event yeah which
is really I don't have time to do your
unboxing because you invited me to this
event I had other stuff too I mean I
could have prioritized it I could have
made one it's not like I didn't but I
also I also didn't cuz I just thought
I'm not like I'm still I do have a like
I'm not a hundred percent in into that
like in the one hands they're easy it's
a very easy to do a quick unboxing of
those bones that AMD sends over and
throw up the video sure and whatever but
I'm also kind of like when I look at the
am the unboxing video compared to the
launch video and like the unboxing video
has twice as many views I'm like I don't
I'm torn by that because the easy views
from the unboxing video and the actual
kind of dang isn't it
this product was tested and here's this
video whistling which workers the
performance of this not just the work
that's involved but like if this video
is getting all these views and it's just
like hey here's this product that's
that's really veers a lot more towards
the ad like this is an ad for a product
sure vs. the review where you can at
least be saying well I'm testing this
product that I'm saying here's what it
was good at and here's what it's bad at
and here's how it does compared to its
competition so why not both so so I have
thoughts I guess is as far as I can go
right now on the trends in the past few
years of the unboxing embargo because
that's really what has come down to is
is is before there was just an embargo
right one all right a new product is
launching there is one embargo dates and
anyone who got that product early any
content that they're gonna post on it
has to go on or after that embargo
launch date in time mm-hmm but now
they've been doing like alright here is
your review embargo date when the
product launches conveniently at the
same exact time it goes up for sale yep
and here's like four or five or days or
a week earlier here's the unboxing
embargo right when you can start hyping
up the products yeah I mean or like like
right I'm and but like for me like I
completely I've done it before I've done
the unboxing videos and again like
thank-yous if the company's not like
you're benefiting just as much from the
company as the company from from this
video even though like yeah you're
technically hyping it up without any
real substantial evidence or performance
numbers you're still benefiting and
profiting off of that hype video yeah
and when you look at the data and it's
also like you have to like ignore
sometimes the vendors and be like okay
what's the relationship with my fans
like this video they were clearly more
into like they somehow watched my
unboxing video more
than the review video so next time a big
water is okay give people what they want
right so next time a generation will
launch comes about like okay like do the
unboxing video even because you know
that the fans who subscribe to you and
give you a living that's what they want
to see to some degree and not every
channels like that but I think at least
for my channel people like the invites
they like that sort of hype feel people
like to get hyped for a product whether
or not it's going to deliver or not you
know the I don't know I don't know so
and and and again like I'm not anti
unboxing and I'm not saying I'm never
gonna do them again I didn't do it this
time around just just didn't work out
but I will say though that going from
the like walnuts box that they did like
for the first rise and launch for the
original rise and launch wouldn't you
know when you very great I didn't get
that I don't think I was like at that
level yet to get the the walnut box I
don't I don't have one no I thought your
at the event I didn't get a walnut box
maybe it's because I couldn't didn't you
actually carry with you left it in the
hotel that's what you did maybe that's
oh yeah that's right they sent me like
the just like the non fancy version
because it was easier to pretend like
you weren't fancy enough to get the rise
in box a year ago that was a year you're
right your was a year ago you're right
you're right I didn't actually get that
box but I couldn't take it with me on
the plane because it was too big and
they wouldn't let me through security
and okay I'm remembering that now and I
had them to ship it to me which you
could have done too but you didn't they
didn't give me the option
anyway so the Rison box now that they
give which is just this kind of it's
yeah I mean it's not a bad box but it's
just it's not just a box it's not as
fancy as the wood one I guess is what
I'm trying to say where those Pelican
cases for threader / oh yeah I sent it
they set some Sam I'm very sad I didn't
give them my my
my vector logo cuz oh alright you look
up see Pew okay let's move on and we're
taking so long sorry
Rison 720 700 X and resin 520 600 X this
is obviously well hopefully obviously
still in the rumor category at least for
us because this doesn't launch until the
19th yeah Thursday but theoretically
possibly maybe some products went out
early to some people and some people
might have had this stuff early so we're
just going to reference you to the
TechRadar link in this video's
description if you want to read a little
bit more but according to tech radar a
PC enthusiast named TS AI K or psyche
right that's what's like sure Sonique
posted a couple cpu-z reports with an
overclocked verizon 26 at 2700 X as well
as a 26 X the 2700 X is the eight core
16 thread version of risin two on the
2600 X would be a six core 12 thread CPU
basically that's some pretty crazy
overclocks 5.8 5.8 gigahertz almost five
point nine five point eight eight four
gigahertz specifically with the core
voltage of one point seven six volts
yeah the motherboard was an MSI X 470
gaming m7 AC shit which you know that's
actually a really nice port it's one of
those right they like that
really maybe well i'm i've been testing
with the easiest one anyway so five
point eight eight four gigahertz on the
2700 x and five point eight eight two
gigahertz with a core voltage of one
point seven six eight volts on the 2600
x so pretty cool that they were able to
overclock it this much now if you're
curious about last generation derp Bauer
Roman was
able to get an 1800 X to 5.8 Hertz which
is just shy of this that's a buddy
that's a year ago though so hopefully
maybe as they test these out more and
get more refined bios's and that kind of
thing for the motherboards have launched
we might see even higher frequencies and
this you can see it break 6 gigahertz
for example that would be sweet so
pretty cool early results and again
right into actually launches on Thursday
April 19th look I gotta excelente the
Google pixel and pixel excel our end of
life that's right what yes these Google
Google branded phones you no longer for
sale
these launched in 2016 they have been
removed from the Google store as well as
the project 5 store what the because
there's the pixel to write see I am just
having about first-gen pixel this first
chimpo no one cares then so that I have
I have a pixel yeah it's outdated
obsolete no no this is very very good
phone stupid it's a piece of ancient
ain't really good phone in 2016 I bought
this phone straight cash money as you
can see it still maintains its that's a
dog hair in pristine condition of shit
wasn't a scratch does a dog hair Doug
semen yeah revolutionary phone change
the landscape of the entire and
estranged the world what a great attempt
as you can see so Excel in the in the in
the gray version as you can see is the
same version that they've used in the
heiress technical article which means
it's the best one not true but at her
opinion cow could demonstrate for you he
has a pixel to yeah they just show that
off really quick this pixel two and a
pixel to excel let me get the
screen protector thing off those
launched in October 2017 but they were
inferior and they sucked no these were
much better and much more highly
reviewed I got one under Authority
issues of the first gen pixel I got one
and I returned it because it sucked so
you got a lemon that's why now the
original pixel phones actually still
stayed available on the pixel store even
after the pixel 2 launched because the
pixel original was so good it was
discounted by 82 $100 but still
constantly out of stock because even
with the launch of the pixel 2 people
were like man that original pixel is
where it's at but you know every era
must come to an end and so it is with
the pixel even though Google sold 3.9
million pixel phones in 2017 that's
really that's that's not as much as you
might expect if you compare it to some
other popular phones but they were more
expensive than the original Nexus phones
I liked in the Nexus phones because I
have a big fan of the like the vanilla
Android experiences is kind of like the
big benefit in my opinion every one of
the big benefits from the pixel phones
but there is still hope for anyone who
is missing the old Nexus phones and
maybe looking for a pixel that they
could actually afford because there's
rumoured to be a mid-range pixel that
might launch this summer ooh
mid range meaning what like 5 600 bucks
mid range meaning not like seven to nine
hundred dollars like a pixel and pixel
XL have been that's exciting but yeah
probably more I mean I would hope maybe
400 e 400 even four or five 600 is that
what you might be great call for a
mid-range phone yeah I'd say so now my
original pixel phone which I'm gonna
keep using until it until I've as long
as I possibly can because it's the best
phone ever design wise I mean imagine if
I were to accidentally squeeze the phone
from the side and some annoying ass
thing were to happen oh no I love that
the squeeze I love that I really use
that yeah because I hate saying okay
Google
like saying okay Google to your phone is
like the new Bluetooth headset earpiece
you're like you just seem like a total
nerd see okay so you just okay so I just
treated me like take me home and it just
does the thing it's like dear like I
don't need to like enjoy like it's like
a real person like you never be like
okay wife make me dinner you would just
say make with us I need to give her a
squeeze right
just squeeze rosettes exactly apparently
you triggered some people flow under
some people's phones just that good okay
Google watch pay for it
Scott yeah hilarious juvenile hardcore
gay porn ever get so lots of lots of
artists of course so have an original
pixel like me you will still get major
updates until October 2018 which doesn't
seem that long to be honest I've only
got major updates on this phone for
another six months security updates will
continue through October 2019 though so
one more year beyond that and after that
like after security updates are gone on
a phone like is wildly yeah you're done
well bless Brad Enzo alright let's let's
move on let's go fuck G what's next
player unknowns battlegrounds popular
game it's also very popular in China
China and some some people who I've read
about have accused Chinese players of
hacking yes and pub cheat yes they're
all too good and some stories you read
it's something of an epidemic and this
story will not necessarily help this is
from PC power play but it is derived
from a an actual story here what the
hell is going on sorry it's not that
bitch clips your opinion
so we talked about Intel's 8th gen stuff
right
Coffee Lake they lunched coffee like
last year and then a lot they launched
coffee like again a couple weeks ago
when they when they were like hey look
here's the rest of the processors on the
lineup and stuff right yep so they did a
big event in Beijing last week to reveal
their new 8th gen processors and of
course they had a bunch of vendor
partners involved including delt
including Dell sports spokesperson Sally
Zhang samozang and according to this
article on power play and this sub
article on PC dot watched out of breath
at COP which goes over Sally's entire
presentation there's picture of Sally
right there yeah
um Sally spoke of how Chinese gamers are
the most innovative and dominant in the
world by using plugins what plugins
quote unquote to for example run faster
than other players or blow up ten cards
at a time wait so you're saying they
cheat this is a cheats she's telling
she's saying the chance players are
better because they cheat yes I use his
cheating plugins I make them have auto
hacks and and wall hacks at bullet time
shit these thoughts these top gamers are
the best at what they do because they
cheat gamers can really use 8th gen
Intel power to run more plugins to win
more chicken dinners and of course all
the top players run the most plugins
because if you're really gonna pub G you
run the most plugins good if you have an
8th gen Dell 8th gen powered Dell
computer its Gentile power gives them
that gamers edge and behind her there
was actually a video playing showing
screen caps of pub G being played with
various cheats enabled including one
apparently where their guns really a big
that's the picture on the right
that's pretty funny that is number one
cuz they have giant ass guns so yeah
Sally tell you that gamers should buy a
bell because they're better at running
many plugins oh my god Morgan this is
supposed to show how detached corporate
yeah like the the corporate tech
officers are from the actual mainstream
of abusers you've got to find a way to
sell the product Kyle and they do not
they have no idea we dealt with this
with Newegg back in the day I don't know
how it is now I can't speak for it now
but years ago like corporate had no idea
what the mind of a corporate I'm sorry
the mind of a gaming enthusiast or a PC
enthusiast was and that's why the
marketing was so bad at times I don't
know how it is now again but back then
we were working there it was just like
dude you guys are so far you're on
you're on Mars you're on a different
planet and that's I feel like we see
that every day this is a prime example
of corporate just not getting it and yet
they make they're responsible for making
and delivering the products that us
gamers use every day and they have no
idea what the culture is once I don't
weigh no idea how do you like what
president waste abysmal to make use of
your 8th gen Intel Core processor the
additional course the additional
processing power you've you've added
more memory of course you can run more
plug-ins for your player unknowns
battleground game plugins that's gonna
eat up the memory and you're gonna be a
better player for it having so there's
there's obviously some normal there's
there's a disconnect somewhere along the
line here between her going up on stage
and presenting this material and someone
being like well obviously the adds a
little bit of memory the hell she's
talking about
it's like the person that she's talking
about and trying to target is the one
that's like dude what you're saying is
totally off base and I will say that the
the the the language that glorifies the
practice that this is an innovative and
dominant way like it innovative in
dominant players are the ones that use
that use cheats in order to do all its
insights innovative may be dominant just
by definition but excuse me not
innovative now they are the ones who
just find real strategy in the game to
be fair the original article here does
reference a follow up from Dell and Dell
did officially comment on this joy they
said and and it's it's it's it's a
corporate response but it's at least an
appropriate response they said and an
attempt to communicate the power of the
new Dell G Series inappropriate
modification examples were used in Dells
product launch event in China last week
this does not reflect our global gaming
culture or strategy we condemn any
modifications misused in gaming that's
good that's a good response so its
corporate speak but at least this was
bad yeah it was wrong we're not we're
not down with that aspire so so so
that's that's the upside and they think
let's never ever speak at a corporate
event ever again is what Dennis is
saying communally let's never let's
never praise cheaters doesn't like yeah
you must need more more compute power
currencies here's here's a way to do
that we are game shark alright let's
move on next segments it will final
final reel segments for today net watch
of course where we talk about internet
and stuff that's associated with it I
don't try to burn through these topics
fairly quickly just because we have
games to play later on but let's talk
about this article from any gadget the
US and the United Kingdom have both
warned that Russia that's been hacking
writers world worldwide there's there's
food in there giving it giving a sly sly
side I couldn't face definitely not of
death okay
like who snapped this picture we're like
wow I got
get in the face that everyone's gonna
use anytime they think Russia's being
shamed not very special when he makes
that facial yeah exactly so this was
originally sourced from reports to the
prime minister of the UK Theresa May
about possible incoming Russian based
cyberattacks now granted that's pretty
pretty broad but they were specifically
talking about the release of
compromising information about the
country's lawmakers so lawmakers in the
United Kingdom further or at least after
that was released they broadened the
scope of this so UK Cyber Intelligence
Agency and CSC as well as the FBI in the
US as well as the DHS have jointly
accused Russian based attackers of
engaging in a campaign for months trying
to compromise routers which are switches
and firewalls around the world the
effort has targeted millions of machines
to spy on ISP customers organizations
and government agencies and the main
targets have been ISPs so Internet
service providers firms that are running
critical infrastructure and the United
States and the UK as well as France and
government departments and big companies
the alert outlines what erratic Hardware
behavior should indicate that the device
has been compromised so if you go to the
Engadget article you can you can click
on that and see the actual details of
the alert so it's the Russians that are
compromising the security of these
routers Sodra so the articles okay I
mean blame blame the Russians - this is
very popular sure
we've I've played call of duty before I
know how it goes but it's basically
because they're trying to say they're
trying to pinpoint the Russians are
trying to verify if Americans are
talking shit basically it's hard to say
what their end goal is Kyle leader the
release of compromising information
about the countries lawmakers is it
original fear but so all this is to say
and the reason I decided to even discuss
this article because again a lot of this
is very
not as specific as I would like I would
like to say for example which specific
heart where they're talking about which
has been gone after and compromised but
it really doesn't get into that again
the actual alert by the Intelligence
Agency has more details on that which is
linked in the article all I forget which
of these links it actually is but it's
in there a lot of the links just go back
to Engadget articles but the point is if
you have a hardware that's connected to
the Internet it needs to be updated
security wise from time to time often
that's critical you will frequently get
updates for your home computer for
example a desktop computer a laptop
computer you'll probably also frequently
get updates for like your cell phone
right you probably get updates all the
time for your cell phone you have to
restart your cell phone and it's like
the only time I ever restart my cell
phone is when it has a security update
the point is there's other stuff that's
connected to the internet in your home
probably for most people it's a router
but might also be intelligent smart home
devices that kind of thing going in and
accessing those devices to determine if
there's been firmware updates for
security there's something that people
don't often do that can be something
that you can do to improve your security
or if you're really paranoid about it
then completely bypass those those ad
hoc devices and build yourself your own
router using a PF using pfSense
lookup pfsense spread around youtube if
you're interested in that and hopefully
Russia just just chill out with packing
stuff that's my pickups blame how you
got the hiccups a little bit you have
water I got you water you did yes right
we should be good there you go hold my
breath okay next up we've talked about
net neutrality pretty frequently and a
GP who's the current chairman of the FCC
and how he's often been opposed to net
neutrality in various ways this is just
sort of a follow up on that as
it comes down to his judgment as well as
the people when it comes to internet
service providers in the United States
and the actions that they frequently
take this does not reflect well on them
this article although the picture on the
the headline of it and this articles
from the verge by the way is definitely
a GTI at sym it's not really necessarily
about him it's about Elizabeth Pierce
and Elizabeth Pierce is the former chief
executive of quintillion which is an
Alaska based fiber-optic cable provider
operating out of Anchorage she's also
the broadband adviser who was selected
by a jeep I pictured right there looking
like a douchebag yep she was picked by
him to run a Federal Advisory Committee
which is called the broadband deployment
Advisory Committee or B Tech B DAC more
specifically that was going out she was
arrested last week nice arrested that is
the best possible thing that could have
happened I mean depending on your
perspective I guess in my respect if you
are her or one of her family members
that's probably not but not the
perspective but here's someone who
appreciates justice than yes that was a
very good thing just as perspective
assuming of course that these alleged
accusations against her art why'd she
get arrested these are a legend she was
arrested on claims she tricked investors
into pouring money into a multi-million
dollar investment fraud scheme sounds
reasonable
yes as the CEO of quintillion prepuce
allegedly raised more than 250 million
dollars from two new york-based
investment companies using forged
contracts with other company companies
guaranteeing hundreds of millions of
dollars in future revenue according to a
lawyer who's involved those sales
agreements were worthless because the
customers had not even signed them Wow
because their fraud yes as alleged Wow
that's three shit and as alleged she
forged the signatures
the count the character parties involved
what uh so that's fraud
good good electing again this is all
alleged she has been arrested not guilty
it's not looking that great for her
right now she was charged with wire
fraud last Thursday and she faces a
maximum sentence of 20 years in prison
HM that's a that's a hard time Brett so
the reason as you PI's face is on the
picture of this article because he
specifically picked her to be the chair
not just like a member but the chairman
of the broadband deployment Advisory
Committee which is a committee that
advises the FCC her to do that and just
like made her the fall guy no no this is
this is stuff she did before she was
involved but I wouldn't be surprised
though here's the point net neutrality
we are in favor of net neutrality I
don't care how it happens if you want to
be a libertarian if you want to be on
the side of big business and whatever
they give me options if I have market
options if I have three four different
choices for what internet service
provider I can sign up for and there is
competition that forces those internet
service providers to give me decent
service for my money than that okay with
that or if I only have a single choice
like most people in America if you're
trying to get a broadband connection
then it should be government regulated
to the point where I have a basic
connection to the internet for a
reasonable price and that the internet
service service provider that I'm
signing it for can't arbitrarily shut
off my connection to this website or
that website because that website hasn't
paid them it's all the same a bit of act
a bit of extra kick down lay this month
or whatever so that's where we're at
we're against a sheet pie and the the
actions of the FCC and to further that
well let's do this out of order I should
switch this to further that since I'm
going to connect these together
California we're in California right now
and apparently the cable lobby AT&amp;amp;T
included are kind of worried about
net neutrality bill that has been
presented here in the great state of
California aren't you proud to be a
citizen of the great state of California
today Kyle especially now
yes AT&amp;amp;T and the lobby group for Comcast
charter Cox as well as a bunch of other
cable companies that's called the CCTA
of the California cable and
Telecommunications Association they're
lobbying against this bill in California
because the bill implements not only the
FCC's basic net neutrality rules from
2015 which were enabled and enforced in
2015 but it also bans paid zero-rating
arrangements in which homem wrote home
or mobile internet providers charge
online services for data cap exemptions
if that sounds boring to you t-mobile
frank example has a zero rating program
right now it's called binge on but
whether or not they charge this the the
source of the content for that data is
actually a big deal because it it may or
may not pass down that that say it that
costs down to you and this is why zero
rating even though it's potentially a
popular service among various internet
service providers and cellphone
providers in the United States is is
also something that should be included
with net neutrality because if your zero
rating something your means you're
charging zero for that whereas you're
potentially charging more for the rest
of the internet yeah and that is a
tiering system and that's not good if
you want the Internet to be universally
accessible but simply so yeah the AT&amp;amp;T
and the CCTA have said that the proposed
bill is too strict compared to the FCC
rules and not just the FCC rules of like
right now but the FCC rules of 2015
which are about to be taken off the
books so they're obviously somewhat
concerned about this to the extent that
they are acknowledging that there's a
decent amount of people who are pretty
comfortable and happy with the 2015
rules and don't want them rolled back
and there's a decent amount of pushback
against that so good on any of you guys
who have been helping with that cause
this California net neutrality bill was
submitted by State Senator Scott Wiener
Wiener wiener not Anthony Weiner Scott
Weiner Scott he's a Democrat from San
Francisco still a wiener it's still
unclear who actually authored the bill
but Weiner says you can't go and get
federal net neutrality protections
repealed and then be surprised and
indignant and complain that states are
stepping up to protect consumers in the
economy ferony makes a lot of sense
because if you're like hey the feds
shouldn't be regulating this stuff right
yeah then usually we go from that that
the the nationwide we shouldn't have
this bill then the states like states
rights usually mm-hmm is the opposite of
that right but this is the states being
like all right we're a state and we want
net neutrality yeah and we're California
and we happen to be the biggest economy
in the nation by a pretty pretty decent
stretch yeah in fact like the sixth or
seventh largest economy in the world if
you counted us as a nation it's true
got some pretty decent club yeah here in
California so all that is to say that
because of those factors in California's
influence on the rest of the nation
state standards such as for instance how
many you guys watch prices rate
hey used to here watch The Price is
Right I have okay back when back when
the price is right had Bob Barker right
yeah he'd sit there with his mic and
he'd be like talking about this thing
maybe never was a new car right a new
car a brand new color and whenever just
talking about a new car and he'd run
down the specs as a new car right blah
blah blah and you know what he will he
would always say it was a dead hooker in
the trunk he didn't he didn't state that
specifically but one of the other things
he would always say is California
emissions right you remember hearing
that California emissions that's because
California and instituted emissions
standards for motor vehicles that is
true and even though it was a California
standard you know all of the motor
vehicle companies
just went by those standards because
California was a large enough market
that it made sense to just abide by
those standards for the entire nation as
opposed to saying like here's the
California cars that have better
emissions sure and here's the cars for
the rest of the nation that like have
crappy emissions it makes sense you know
still shitting sulfur on your lawn or
whatever when you're driving them
it smells like eggs so obviously there's
other stuff to be discussed here and
there's probably people who are like
fuck California and that kind of thing
but I don't care I point out that if
California is leading the charge in in
supporting net neutrality I hope that
you guys who also support net net
neutrality would be behind that and that
is all I have to say for that watch for
today okay let's move very interesting
yeah very fascinating gamey after-party
yeah that's what's supposed to be next
raining after party this is fun Wow we
also need chips we need chips oh can we
get some chips I got like 15 minutes

open them I hit some hate summary what
the aldress chips this is those are the
good ones
where is steam yes okay so my my
theoretical plan here is for Kyle and I
to play a game at the same time that we
go over donations as well as yips no
just Yelp just the object this way
maybe get more paper towels - okay and
the game that I was hoping we would play
I'll see if this actually works take you
down down Janet rest okay do it I just
downloaded earlier so it's telling me
the first time installation is going on
great thanks Stan we can start going
over donation comments so cuz we need to
get through those let's do it oh the old
ones were deleted
how cool it alright alright pup shepherd
five dollars you can connect the pup cam
to Puppy Linux wags wags very very we'll
keep that in mind thank you very much

key killer block jerry rigs to work with
it wow that sounds pretty impressive
nice good look on that and i hope it all
works out Oh tweet me a picture that
when it's done we're supposed to be
playing out that we're trying out
ruffles all dressed chips we are I've
had these before though because we've
been to Canada yeah so hasn't can maybe
no but these are being distributed in
the US now moths psychologist number one
flavor in Canada it says what do you
throw in the US now yeah
wait do they have ketchup chips nattu so
it says I bet you're wondering what all
dress means after all in America it just
means you're wearing all your clothes
but but in Canada all dressed usually
actually means delicious ridgy chips
that somehow taste salty savory and
sweet all at the same time so that
they're all dressed strips that perfect
do mommy can do that I'll be the judge

bazinga X $25 great show is always Paul
what do you think of the Samsung 49 inch
CH g s-- g 90 super ultra while it's
huge HDR yeah um i did a review of that
already it's on blame it will hit
YouTube in a comment isn't sure yeah
wait oh the super ultra wide yeah q LED
okay okay yeah I thought about the the
42 inch 4k one that has oh yeah that's
really great monitor to the super ultra
might that you're talking about is very
nice if you're a hardcore gamer and you
really want that encompassing peripheral
vision but just watch my video on it
I'll explain everything
I thought the resolution was a little
low to be honest the resolution is a bit
low
1080 vertical resolution it favors it
favors the actual width more so than the
resolution so some people are gonna be
rubbed the wrong way on that and I
definitely talk about that in my videos
we hurry because I gotta take my glasses
off Samson oh yeah yes you do and you
will we will see shit and you'll look
terrible
Troy Samson $5 I'm building a new
computer I'm saving up for a GPU I was
wondering if I can run my computer and
surf the Internet until I get a GP for
gaming
yeah what why not
depending on um if you have an IG P so
he gets an APU from AMD or
until until you're fine because all of
all of us have AI GPUs for the most part
mm-hmm AMD you want to make sure that
you start out with one of the another
Raven Ridge ap use yeah yeah that'll
that'll carry you through web browsing
news 8's keno problem and when you're
ready just pop it just be GPU in there
and you're good to go
it smells so so fresh and clean very I
do you look here cuz you're bald we have
very little hair so I'm gonna touch
awaits your scary face mark your hearing
to make it actually connect can attach
to my face
now cheaply disturbing Kosmic for the
five bucks hey guys I'm a root I'm in a
rural area and stuck with AT&amp;amp;T D assault
DSL and their modern router modem router
call most Netgear are crap can you
recommend a good modem router combo Asus
makes some really good router combos
router modem combos Buffalo I've been
very satisfied with their performance as
well that's what I use at home
I can't really give you any like
specific model names cuz there's so many
now and it's really just brands that I
can recommend Buffalo should set the
timer right yeah I would do that do you
have any good modem router combo
recommendations no like I don't I don't
use enough of them yeah it's one of
those things that like use it for a few
years and that's like all you interact
with until you need a new one and then
by then it's like a different generation
and you know things have advanced so far
since the last time you bought one but
um I look into Asus Buffalo variant one
that can't be like compromised by
someone in China somehow sure this is
vague there you go
sure noxus gaming $20 even Tobias
streaming pc only I went overkill and
best quality at 1080p 60fps AMD 1920 X

50 pro's 256 gig ideas thoughts give me
thumbs to 1920 X so that's my thought
yeah he's already set up he's already
got a 78 20x though why you don't really
need much more to stream at 1080 60 yeah
I mean I need to upgrade if you're
noticing it's for struggling where did
the key oh wait if your system
struggling to stream 1080 60 which I
don't think it is with your phone setup
then maybe upgrade to a 1950 Expo 78 20
X is a good CPU for streaming these

oh my god you can live like a king for

Bangkok Bangkok and go to northern

I went for my honeymoon
the resort that my wife and I went to in
Thailand is called P malai it was really
it was really nice is this you right
next to me yeah oh thank you so do I can
do self-damage three-peat there's three
people right there so I'm not sure well
I killed myself of I you can okay I mean
is there a move here is there an attack
that will only attack you even if I'm
really close like the punch is one
there's also a shotgun I think that one
that you're doing what is just it's like
a hotdog can just like okay forward and
the fire punch is like a half is like a
yeah fire punch then how do i execute it
just space i think okay oh okay
it hit Dukey so you are you both of
those guys we're just one of those guys
there's two guys in front of me know
your own gay oh think auntie killed me

worked on the design of the gigafactory
for Tesla Wow glad I've contributed to
your house battery Paul nice thank you
Ben
nice yeah my house battery is completely
useless right now they're gonna redo
that and I have to redo the roof and
it's three weeks out to reschedule them
to redo the roof and then they can
install the solar and then I have to
wait two to six weeks damper the it's a
whole process panel for the final like
approval of everything and then I can
turn on and use my power wall damn and
that would be very excited I'm very much
thinking forward to that video but thank
you Ben I'm sure it'll be worth it all
yeah hopefully Oh crabs was lazy smoking
nuns five dollars Kyle what are your
plans for 1 million subs I don't know I
have no plans mainly because I didn't
think that it was gonna come around so
quickly but yeah
oh I supposed to ask you about that
actually it's it's kind of crazy I think
I had one or two videos in the last
couple weeks that have done really
and I've kind of gone I wouldn't say
viral but have just really taken off and
it's it's brought in a lot of new subs
that I didn't expect and so I thought I
had a lot more time to plan for a 1
million sub video uh and it's it's a
head of you we had one morning I think
in the next 10 or 20 seconds my wife is
gonna try to come in and ah I think good
that's that's good premonition if you're
right that's very it's your turn by
those super super human power
Jim Bob okay are you still down there
I'm done here or or you can aim over
here at Scottie or Jim Bob I'm gonna try
to get you again with this that's
grenade lash here alright and then what
does this one do that's a cluster bomb
sub tops in a few smaller ones you
probably I mean I get close to me you're
probably better with the fingernail yeah
Oh God now you protected in that little
crevice they're still figuring out what
I'm going to do for a million subs
though um I have some ideas over feeling
right now though but something's coming
it's in enough Israel Garcia $4.99
surface book to i7 8650 you GTX 1060
Orla or laptop like Razer plus external
GPU looking to replace my tablet want to
game on the mobile I would suggest just
going for an all-in-one solution if you
can get a high-powered I get the most
expensive or most high-powered laptop
you can find and don't go for the
external GPU out because it's expensive
you have to buy the external dock which
can be a couple hundred bucks easy and
then you have to buy the discrete GPU
which are still pretty inflater right
now even though the prices are going
down just go with like the best laptop
you can afford and life will be easier
and more cost-effective for you in the
long run it's not a great time to buy an
external GPU with docked it's just not
core maximum is $5 Kyle cover how to
stream on Twitch with a camera overlay
and stuff no one from ltte Paul Dave 2d
etc has covered this would be really
helpful
there are so many tutorials on how to
stream vision very simply with a camera
webcam involved so I would just do some
research just check on Google how to
stream with the camera and stuff on OBS
whatever it is very sure that you could
find something good there okay is that
you up there the red guy yeah I'm all
the Reds okay oh I can I guess I can
move here comm shift is to jump by the
way Oh
in the leadership I can even Wow a
single tap will jump forward and a
double tap low don't kind of like up
okay all right and I'll try this and so
if you're just trying to shoot me to
bazooka straight up maybe probably
pretty safe bet I can aim here yep
nice it's pretty direct I'd be 40 50 40
50 damage day okay 45 they go I'll take
it down now you're at the vantage point
now it's true
have your way with me all right truenox
is gaming fiber ology I get amazing FPS
but like 80 when streaming like 105 165
plus FPS on all gauges or maybe games he
meant it's why I want a dedicated
streaming PC yes streaming can
definitely impact your performance in
game at the other day it's you know it's
about if you're gonna be streaming that
means you're streaming for an audience
and what they're seeing is probably more
important than what you're seeing but at
the same time you still want to have a
joyful experience and enable yourself to
game comfortably right otherwise your
gameplay will suffer then your what your
viewers are seeing will suffer so yes
you could go for a dedicated stream you
PC but it's probably more cost effective
to just upgrade your system so you
haven't really given me any sort of idea
of what hardware you're rocking but
maybe you need to upgrade that CPU and
your motherboard and honestly 80 FPS
when streaming isn't that bad to be
honest so I don't know what kind of
performance you're generally used to but
I think you're doing all right
but again upgrading your system
and just streaming off of that is
probably a better idea right now
children then having a dedicated
steering PC so for you I just dropped a
dynamite like right down on my head is
this phone gonna get in the way you can
go yeah well it's kind of cool okay I
can right click this is a dynamite you
only have one of them it's gonna drop it
I'm pretty so you gonna probably want to
go like down to there so how do you aim
with the dynamite
you don't even just drops it right so
you just click really quick and then
you'll have 5 seconds to try to evacuate
see if I want to get down here so Jobs
ahead so I can yeah oh wow oh oh too far
oh shit Oh if you drop too far and it
took damage than you lost your turn no
that's lux I'm terrible at this game
it's fine I defined
I'd make a very bad worm I've never
played a game where I had no idea how to
play in you welcome to face off everyone
wishbone five dollars what about asus
strix freesync next-gen monitors no more
rog because of GP p that's question as
far as I know in video GP p only applies
through the graphics card that would
actually be the only place where it made
sense because rog because i OG would
apply to nvidia graphics cards so you
would get an nvidia monitor that
supported juicing right and in aries
exactly an aries monitor with a fishing
port freesync yeah so there would
actually be like wow that Tyson's
maybe that's what it's all about maybe
that maybe that's the solution true yeah
anyway and yeah you could still have an
asus strix free sync monitor because
Strix is not subject to GP p yes it's
good is flexible it's fluid it can go
between either manufacturers very strict
see Marco Mei Ming Keenan 10 euros first
time to catch you guys live good morning
from Finland 6 a.m. keep up the good
work
kiss I'm sure khipus means I love you in
Finland I feel so refreshed
thank you very much Marco Yeah right it
was kind of a nice feeling after we have
you take it off all of my beard felt
kind of
that hardcore hardware $4.99 launch week
2017 I bought a courser I'm sorry
crosshair crosshair six extreme for a
risin build six our mas one hundred and
fifty dollars plus shipping fees or two
brick replacement boards later help dude
that just sounds like really bad luck
yeah the Corsair six extreme should not
be that all t then they didn't make an
extreme version of the C six are they
we're surf six of the stream no no
there's a hero c6h maybe of course
you're six with stream right hand well
they did I guess so the cross for six
hey I never I never saw that word so um
dude I don't know man
maybe it's just you're just having a
really bad streak of luck and I don't
really know what to say other then if
you're really just not confident in the
platform any more than just take a
different route and just I don't know
send it all your shit but hopefully this
latest board that you get solves all
that shit cuz that's what's brutal yeah
it's a pretty recent board one hundred
and fifty dollars in shipping fees that
is brutal
that is so brutal I'm gonna kill Paul
now let's see is that him
Jim Bob is that me is that him I'm gonna
try to drop a grenade here assuming
that's me alright
come on come on that didn't do shit son
of a bitch
I'm sure there's much more strategy to
this game that I'm just not not not up
to you right now I'm blue okay did I
just go for Paul maybe I just went for
Paul okay this is my turn now I'll just
go again
it's me can I throw a grenade right at
this guy wait I don't know am i blue am
i blue right now or no no this isn't me
right I'm gonna bazooka the shit out of
this guy wait for it wait for it
and I totally killed myself well I did
some serious damage to myself but at
least I got I think I think I did damage
to you and I might have killed one of
your worms
what no but I can't be sure I might have
also gone for you
suppose you don't can it sing say that's
my worms no I don't think it did that
okay oh boy so much better okay where
were you did you did you do all the
donation comments yeah oh good all right

to be fast a stupid stupid game just go
ahead go ahead and murder me see my
fancy stuff yet see if I concur Buster
there's an air strike the Sheep let me
try the Sheep here comes a sheep do it
no no
get out of there sheep your sheep saw
the sheep's in the terrible place Wow
explosive sheep the Sheep killed Jim Bob
instead of you guys does that me or is
that you know I'm red oh you're red
you're blue all right I'm gonna kill you
the thing no I'm gonna grenade you no
wait
I'm no I don't want to that how do I
even get you I'm trying hold on right
click I can move on
all right click all right I got man I
got this I wasn't trying to help you at
all no no you should I don't know - you
totally move your two dudes closer
together yeah that's a very well j'en
move strategically hey if you just keep
cheeping me I'll be fine what the fuck
is a bubble and then one sheep and
they're dead what's some of the bubble
thing I don't I think that's just all
right that's the dental oh shit oh my
god was it good chef what a hit now I'm
good shot now I'm dead
reap the sheep oh damn you can like
sample oh you're like a little worm I
didn't mean to go through they know baby
yeah that's three there's four types of
words you can choose different types of
worms I chose to duplicate my my group
to your group so he'd be ha but there's
this guy and he's he's like a smart guy
and every if he's if he's a lively trend
then all of your other worms get five
extra health I see is this the most
powerful attack a direct hit with that I
think does 50 damage which is among the
most powerful text that's that's
repeatable and everything like that the
shotgun gives you two shots okay each
that can do I think 20 to 25 so you can
shoot it once and then move and then
shoot again which is which is handy
there's a there's a water strike which
is like a plane that flies above and you
can just tell that anywhere on the map
and it drops water and it can wash stuff
thinking it wash worms off the edge of
that it doesn't matter like if you if
I'm this close to you how powerful the
bazooka is like if I have enough as long
as you're yeah it's all it's all the
same okay too much so I hit you and okay
you're still in five I'm still alive
though
damnit ah but since I have some right
since I have three and you have to
you're gay might come up again form the
form my guy Oh like like the turn order
like you might get to go again yeah tell
us you there's so many weapons though
I'm like I don't even know it was yeah
finger do nothing nipple nipple button
oh toxin Burke Oh
a little cliffhanger action there yeah
Oh God
Oh God oh Jesus oh so close
okay his jump is not today and I could
jump out of there yeah there's a jet
pack somewhere but I can't okay so you
can probably get a grenade over into
there right I think I need some chance
you'll you'll get JimBob yeah although
maybe if I if I throw it just slightly
enough so that it doesn't yeah you gotta
you gotta be delicate okay that's good
enough sure
there you go what did you explode into
there's a little thing there there's a
gravestone and you can choose your
gravestone that's part of your flare
right so but I can't collect it or
anything and get anything for it no no
it was like my trophy century trophy
homing missile
oh that sounds cheap why don't I know
about that I like that let's just
usually target someone oh my god oh my
god so long Jim Bosman North Korea my
acid what the fuck and CF for four
points of health left good lord
need closure great oh I totally got this
no problem
yeah do you want the suggestion yeah
yourself up here so you're defensive
it's a hard for me to tell you okay
right-click should I do that
hell no there's a bunker buster what's
this one your striker strike that's
probably want to do a straight okay ends
and then just like point it you want it
right in here really visit probably
great between and it'll get both of you
think both of them yeah because it's
coming from that a oh is that why no
it'll get both you from here and it's
gonna be a line of bombs I see I see
okay all right so this is sort of the
midpoint okay huh
all right come on
yeah yeah all right okay you still have
that good vantage point that I was
hoping it would like take you down yeah
your honor yeah oh okay okay we're
one-on-one now why did he blow up twice
he just blew up like a second time just
now if if you if you kill them with
enough to bring them to zero and they're
stopped then then they they they
kamikaze top-load okay it's actually a
strict strategy like if you kill someone
on top of another guy he can blow
themselves up no the other people too
got you all right I am this is see like
I'm hard to get but then again I don't
even have to be like clear though you
have all these weapons though you just
use your yes and there we go I have a
change
oh no this should be a way to all the
worms have like penises yeah they always
look like a wrinkled up penises camera
aim tab it might be tab I'll go fuse
time like I want to cheat too much hold
the feeds a bow that is tab oh Jesus
here we go come on be enough it's gone
via now totally nice can you play this
online I don't need either poor damage
yes
leave some players that would be fun
this is worms Armageddon it's fun game
yeah I like that
I got demolished you got it's just not
my not my night yeah you got most damage
dealt 363 though your game right alright
cool
well um shit like that is I guess the
only thing we have left to do is to at
