back to Pauls hardware today I have a
mysterious black geforce gtx box sitting
here next to me what could be inside you
probably have no idea given that the
title of this video is most likely
listed right below me right now so I'm
not fooling anyone this is the new
geforce gtx 780 brand new video card
based on the gk110 GPU that's the same
GPU that shipped with the geforce gtx
titan i'm going to go ahead and give you
guys a close up look as well as go down
all of the gritty details and
specifications so let's take a closer
look at the 780 and the first thing
you're probably going to notice is it's
a Titan well it's not really a Titan but
it's very close to its site and you'll
notice essentially the same design even
the same layout on the PCB it's it's
really like ninety-nine percent there I
sort of call it about eighty-five
percent of a Titan because if you
actually look at the number of SMX units
that's streaming multiprocessors those
are kind of the building blocks that
make up the Kepler architecture the
Titan has 14 SMX units that gives it
2688 cuda cores the 780 has 12 or as
compared to 14 that gives it a total of
2304 cuda cores so still a ton of
processing power here so i say
eighty-five percent when it comes to the
GPU will say fifty percent when it comes
to the memory because you do get three
gigabytes of gddr5 memory with the 780
that's as compared to the six gigabytes
that you get with the titan you get the
same layout the same cooler you get the
aluminum housing polycarbonate window
there you can also see the dual slot
aluminum heatsink through there so
you're getting essentially the same
cooling solution as well so you have a
spectacular way to spectacular li
weighted blower style fan stays really
really quiet even when it spins up to
pretty decent rpms when you get when you
get it under an extremely heavy load it
might spin up a lot more than that but
in my experience even when I was running
like three or four Titans it was still
staying very very reasonable when it
came to sound as well as temperature
speaking of temperature that's another
feature you get here is the
the advantage of GPU boost to point out
previously only available on the Titan
so that's kind of going to give you
automatic overclocking within a defined
temperature target as opposed to a power
target that GPU boost one point I used
you also get the ability to over volt so
that was another feature of the Titan
that was very very nice of them to
include you get a base clock of 863 and
a boost clock of 900 megahertz although
I'm guessing when you're actually
utilizing GPU boost to point out you're
actually going to get much higher
frequencies and that the Titan was very
easily able to hit and go beyond 1000
mega Hertz with just a tiny little bit
of tweaking memory six thousand eight
megahertz affective memory clock 3072
megabytes total you do also maintain the
384 bit memory interface so that's going
to be extremely helpful if you're
running a lot of eye candy in your games
if you're going to be turning on TX AAA
or higher level anti-aliasing effects
tessellation physics and a fatter memory
pipe is always helpful when it comes to
that gives you a total memory bandwidth
of 288 point four gigabytes per second
you will be having some benchmarks over
on the newegg TV YouTube channel of
course so you can check out those once
we actually have them up but 1080 or
Beyond if you're going to go with the
2560 x 1440 2560 x 1600 gonna see really
excellent performance out of this you
have 7.1 billion transistors on the
gk110 it's seriously just massive and
extremely powerful when it comes to a
GPU beyond that again just like the
Titan you get two dual-link DVI
connection points one HDMI one
DisplayPort you can still do your triple
monitor gaming out of this you can
actually do three plus one displays so
you can have four connected total it
maintains a dual-slot designs so of
course you do still have to sli fingers
right there so you can do to weigh three
way or four way I am hoping that we can
somehow get for these so we can kind of
duplicate our our Titan setups where we
were doing four-way Titans because that
was a lot of fun i'd like to see how the
seven 80's perform in that configuration
power connectors eight pin and a 6-pin
nvidia is recommending a 600 watt power
supply for this units TDP stays at 250
wats so again a really good power
consumption for this device so another
really cool feature again I want to come
back to the the cooler on this because
it's it's a really impressive design
design I like it a lot you get a copper
vapor chamber dual slot aluminum
heatsink blower fan an actual metal
housing for the entire thing the blower
fan means that the hot air is primarily
going to be ejected at the back of the
case so it's not really going to be
contaminating the heat or temperature
for the rest of your internal components
in your computer so yeah a really good
design overall and oh I should also
mention the green logo on the side when
you actually install and plug it in that
will glow just like the Titan and that
is just about going to wrap it up for
this video guys but I know what you're
probably thinking you're thinking Paul
we want to see benchmark show us
benchmarks and I will I will very soon I
promise as of the filming of this video
I really only just had a chance to sort
of take it out of the box get a first
look at it so I'm kind of the same boat
with you guys but we will we will be
testing this we will be showing you
benchmark comparisons probably against
like I'm thinking the 680 probably
compared to the Titan maybe also compare
it to some of the AMD video cards that
are that are out there as well so it
should be pretty awesome so stay tuned
to the newegg TV youtube channel for
that of course if you'd like to see more
of my personal videos you can stay tuned
to my channel which you are watching
right now don't forget to subscribe
don't forget to like this video because
it's a freaking gtx 780 damn it and it's
awesome and yeah I guess that wraps it
up thanks again guys and we'll see you
in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
