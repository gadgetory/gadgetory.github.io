the video description hey guys how's it
going - welcome to Paul's Hardware
today's video is all about how I built
this computer is RGB I was a little on
the fence about it at first but after I
saw the pretty lights and colors I
decided wow this is the best system ever
and I'm completely happy with my
purchase so today's video is just about
how once you build a computer like this
you're happy with it forever and even
though yeah there may be a few things
like having digitally addressable front
200 millimeter fans or maybe like the
option for a front tempered glass piece
might be nice but I'm pretty much
satisfied with what I take it all back
there is now an H 500 M from cooler
masters so the system that we built in
the H 500 P sucks and this is much
better so let's be honest if you watch
show coverage such as the CES 2018 show
coverage you may have already known that
the H 500 M was on the way because
coolermaster showed off an early version
of it there speaking of show coverage
I'm gonna be a Computex next week in
Taipei Taiwan so don't forget to
subscribe because I have lots of videos
coming out with coverage of that events
for today though I have a limited amount
of time so what I'm gonna do is take
this RGB overkill build that I did
earlier this week it's got a team t4c
delta r gb SSD in there as well some
team memory I'm gonna transplant it into
this system and then they'll talk about
the differences between H 500 P and H
500 M
I have unboxed H 500mm I managed to get
all of the plastic off of the tempered
glass and plastic pieces although it was
kind of sticky didn't want to come off
all the way but let's talk first off
about differences between the h 500 B
and H 500 n first thing you might notice
is that there is mesh on the front right
now but this is actually a swappable
panel and it comes with a tempered glass
piece in the box as well so once you
remove that front panel and slop this
one in looks like it's gonna screw into
place
I have not some kind of percent
determined how to remove this front
panel yet so I'll get to that when the
time comes up here on the top IO you'll
see Coolermaster continuing their
attempts to make people forget their
names so they this is their logo which
is kind of their hex thing and they're
not putting the Coolermaster logo on
anymore it's a branding thing let me
know if you like it or not let
Coolermaster know if you like it or not
I'm okay with it
I think it's alright this will light up
with RGB when the system's actually
turned on we have 4 USB 3.0 ports up
here and a USB 3.1 type C port which I
am probably most excited about also
worth pointing out that these two fronts
200 millimeter RGB fans are addressable
RGB rather than the 4 pin 12 volt
they're the 3 pin 5 volt that means you
can get multiple colors in them versus
the H 500 P where the two fans are gonna
be just a single color although it can
of course cycle between different colors
but it has come only be one color at a
time if you were to use that front
tempered glass piece then you would have
tempered glass on four sides the front
the side panel here which I've already
removed and it's pretty much the same
side panel as H 500 P tempered glass
across the top now so that is an upgrade
replacing it from the plastic top
of the H 500 P and tempered glass on the
opposite side here as well internally we
have some nice upgrades they have
reconfigured this bottom chamber for the
power supply the shroud here has a
knockout here towards the front so that
will allow it to accommodate larger and
thicker radiator configurations if
you're going to swap that out and
there's mounts up here not just for the
Toyota millimetre fans but also 420 140
millimeter fan variants so lots of
different options up there also they've
included this Universal pump bracket
here so if you're gonna water cool this
system this is better suited for that
than H 500 P pump bracket there and then
also this vertical rail system so you
can mount reservoirs they've also
included this little bracket and this is
actually a GPU support bracket so that
should help I believe you flip it around
and then wear your graphics card might
be over here you can slide that up or
down and just keep your GPU from sagging
here's another hex logo without the
cooler master words on it and then I
initially thought that they had
regressed in their mounting for SSDs
they got a couple mounts here and a
couple mounts on the back and the
motherboard tray however these actually
mount by mounting four plugs to the
bottom of the SSD and then it just sits
right there and it's sort of held in
place by these little rubber grommets
and that's pretty much it for the
initial once-over of the feature
differences between the H 500 mm and H
500 P of course all the other features
of the H 500 P that you maybe have come
to know and love still exist here
including the panels for covering your
cable management in the back and just
the nice clean look overall it does have
a bit of an updated look on the front I
guess aesthetically as well but it does
look like they've put tons of extra
ventilation here on the side so if you
do go with tempered glass in the front
you will get still hopefully a decent
amount of airflow I'm not doing
scientific tests of airflow today though
I'm just going to get this system
swapped into this system
oh wow Thank You Kat you did that I'm
told me that why I think cuz it's funny
she doesn't why I'm here
point out my failures yeah this is why
I'm here guys cuz follow why you'll eat
fish what did you do pause never I
wouldn't show this but just forcing me
big time fail haven't done this in a
really long time fortunately we didn't
do much stress testing with this cooler
but I left the plastic on yeah more
plastic to you for your kids well that's
kind of good I didn't melt right oh it
wouldn't do anything unless I like
actually you have to you have to warm
the system person I was already sweaty
before that happened
so as I am swapping out the liquid
cooling solution I am realizing well at
first I thought that that cooler master
had had regrets to get but they did not
so this is the top bracket for the H 500
P and it has a bit of height to it so
you can put fans mount it up in there
whatever it is convenient to mount a
radiator and fans to that so that you
can then mount that to the case mats
with four screws there's a similar tray
to that here on H 500 M this tray though
is flat versus the sort of raised tray
they have there and I actually think
there is a little bit more vertical
clearance with the H 500 m then the H
500 P goes up a little bit taller not
too much I'm but you could still mount
fans on top of this which we're gonna
need to do so you still get basically
the same configuration when it comes to
where you have to install up here I just
noticed that I wasn't able to do what I
originally planned which is to take the
whole assembly off of this and swap it
over to this one in case you're
wondering if they fits probably not it
does set right there but there's six
screws to mount this one in forward
about this one so the screw holes don't
line up
I found another update for the H 500 M
since this opposite side panel also has
tempered glass with the M versus the
solid side panel to age 500 P they've
added one more a little protective piece
down here and this is just a cover up
where your cables are coming out of your
power supply and that tray down there so
I'm not sure if I'm gonna get everything
wired up underneath these things but
just like this panel on the left side
there's just a couple screws that hold
it in and another discovery mounted to
the back of this is a little intelligent
control panel so you can connect up your
LEDs
huh I don't know if this in that it's a
feeler that fan do you think no thinking
spins all right
did you like put that did you did you
mount the bracket so where it's holding
up the graphics card yeah you have to
like slide it up
yeah the fan bumps it hmm all right guys
this build got a rush towards the end
mainly because I am leaving in like 18
hours to fly to Japan so here it is in
all of its glory I will say looking at
the addressable digital LEDs on the
front fans their matches much more
appropriately with the rest of the
addressable digital RGB LED stuff that's
in the case so I think that's definitely
a big thumbs up and heck even if you got
an H 500 P you could probably swap out
for those upgraded a RGB fans that's
what they're calling them addressable
RGB and get yourself this entire
configuration now the cable management
on the other side is not done at all I
did not put any of those cover panels on
that so sorry I'm not going to show you
guys the pretty look at that I really
just had to get everything in here and
up and running and overall I think
coolermaster has done a great job sort
of refining this case over the past year
or so since they first started showing
it off I think it looks really nice with
all the LEDs and with the black I feel
like since I got a lot of black
components in there it's it's got a nice
balance going on it's not quite as
over-the-top I think as the white finish
now if I have developed a pet peeve with
this case it is absolutely going to be
the installation or mounting of the side
panel here I just feel like something
that doesn't require a tool because you
really need a flathead or something to
twist that and put it in place it's
really the only thing standing out to me
right now of course this has really just
been my first impressions of the H 500 M
but I'm liking what I see so far
and I think anyone who gets this case
will be happy with it
I do want to point out the cost $200
MSRP so it's about 50 bucks more than
the HT 500 P for some additional
tempered glass as well as some more
usability especially if you're
considering liquid cooling in the future
but guys don't forget to subscribe to my
channel because all next week I'm going
I'm gonna be bringing you coverage from
Computex in Taipei Taiwan so lots of
videos lots of new stuff coming out hit
the thumbs up button if you enjoyed this
video of course and we'll see you guys
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
