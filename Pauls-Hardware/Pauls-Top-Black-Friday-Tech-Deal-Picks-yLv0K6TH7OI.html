the case but I have actually been
spending a lot of time starting last
night which was Black Thursday no
Thanksgiving
it's called Thanksgiving but starting
last night and also this morning I've
been looking up a bunch of tech deals
the idea being to share those with you
guys
then being curated by me and also
hopefully a little bit more along the
lines of technology computers all that
good stuff I actually also have a bunch
of links that are down in this video's
description so if you guys go down there
you can click on the links and go
directly to these tech deals and
hopefully all of them will remain in
stock and available for a decent period
of time it is actually Black Friday
right now it is late morning and a lot
of these deals are going to be
proceeding throughout the weekend and
then Cyber Monday as well granted it is
that really super busy time of the year
so we never know what's gonna sell out
what's still gonna be available but
hopefully all this stuff should be good
all right let's move right along and
dive into it now I need to make a couple
notes here right up at the front one is
that I have not received any money or
compensation or anything like that for
any of these links I'm giving you guys
none of the stuff is paid or solicited
the only way that I am benefiting from
this other than your hopefully love and
adulation is the Amazon links are using
my Amazon affiliate code so if you click
on those or just click on my Amazon
affiliate code before you do shopping
this year a little kickback helps me out
a lot and really appreciate that
other than that though none of this
stuff is paid so I want to point that
out not I don't like doing that stuff
alright yeah late morning it is late
morning as chat espana but uh it's still
like morning here it's still Black
Friday I promise all right so I'm gonna
go over some PC hardware components
component at the time CPU motherboard
graphics card all those get things I
also have some monitors and peripherals
towards the end so if you're watching
this in the future so free to jump
forward and and check those out or if
you watch in live hey thanks for joining
me I'm streaming live to my youtube
channel okay I'll start with CPUs shall
we kind of right at the top of the game
jumping over here and tigerdirect
changed this deal like literally I don't
know what time they did it but I set
this deal up before
and it's it's not really there anymore
it's one of those site wide promos that
Tiger probably found out about and then
they drop the price of the CPU so the
CPU was 215 and then you could get $25
off 100 if you use Visa the check out at
Tiger Direct and then you could get this
for about 189 as of now it's gonna be
more like 200 which isn't as much of a
good deal but it's still there
Tiger Direct apparently after being sold
for 12 million dollars it's just trying
to clear out the inventory but not
trying hard enough damn it
CPU deals are actually pretty hard to
come across but fortunately not all is
lost here's an AMD deal over on new egg
for the FX 8350 quite capable eight core
CPU 150 bucks this has been a solid
performer for a lot of people granted
it's not the newest architecture or
anything like that but if you are an AMD
fan or you just like the company want to
support them or you just want a pretty
decent deal on a 8 corp CPU check that
out ambi FX 8350 for 150 dollar ok
moving along really realistically guys
if you really want a good deal on a cpu
you should live next to a Micro Center
I've said this many times before but
they have like doorbuster deals all the
time on their CPUs so go to my Crescenta
and find a walk-in store I apologize for
any of you guys who can't do that just
like you know get up and go if it's not
local to you I have one about a
20-minute drive away 20 to 25 minutes
depending on traffic and it's worth it
for me a lot of times to go down there
and do that they have stuff going on
like an i-5 6500 for 200 bucks 4690k
here for 180 dollars like for real 180
you can even get a 6600 K for an actual
reasonable price of $230 anyway
I'll stop teasing you guys who aren't in
a closed location to micro Center with
those let's move on to GPUs though is
actually I wasn't able to find a ton of
good GPU deals until I just started
specifically searching at Newegg and not
looking for featured stuff but using the
drill down menus to find stuff so here's
a msi gtx 970 this is the black and
white version
it's overclocked and holy crap this is a
good deal first off you got to click see
price and cart you know that's always a
good thing
why is my phone going off um to 290 is
what you get this like out of the gate
and there's a $30 million rebate card so
a GTX 970 for two hundred and sixty
dollars total kinda nice that's a pretty
significant deal since we are dealing
today I am gonna be including some mail
and rebates and that kind of thing so
please bear with me on that if you're
really being frugal and trying to get a
good deal it's a good way to get a much
better deal on a graphics card or
something like that
speaking of which here's on gtx 980
these are typically 558 dollars you
there's been some deals that have been
down in the 500 ish 510 dollar range but
how about four hundred and forty dollars
like what you pay and then also a thirty
dollar man rebate card for gtx 980 from
msi this is also their g1 gaming for
their gaming 4g versions not to you on
gaming that's gigabyte and $30 million
rebate card makes this four hundred and
ten dollars all all together III think
that's a pretty damn good deal for a gtx
980 i did want to include some AMD
options here as well so i was went
hunting for those and here's an AR 9 380
the Strix Edition from Asus which is a
very nice card I mean all these cards
from Asus are very well designed they
have nice coolers on them they stay nice
and quiet constantly well rated although
this one only has two feedback but I'm
anyway 170 dollars and a $30 million
rebate card again very nice deal so 140
dollars total for an r9 380 it's a 2 gig
cart so bear that in mind that that is
probably the biggest drawback for this
particular one but still $140 for some
really nice performance there I wouldn't
recommend this card if you're going
above 1080 but if you're on a budget
1080 graphics card alright let's move on
to motherboards there are some good
motherboards if you're thinking about
skylake here's a fantastic fantastic
deal for a skylake motherboard from
gigabyte this is the Gaz one 70 X gaming
3 ATX motherboard so says the full z170
chipset which means you can overclock
with it this isn't even like a cut-rate
z170 board it actually has some decent
power delivery components and that kind
of things
can actually overclock with it and this
is on sale for 160 on B&amp;amp;H photo video
right now but you can get a $10 million
rebate which is listed right here and
you can do $50 off so bear that in mind
the promo code you want to use this BFM
be G IgA and you get 50 freakin dollars
off of this thing so the total comes to
$100 and free shipping for is for like a
not bare-bones z170 board like a good
one from gigabyte with like the metal
reinforced PCIe slots in that kind of
thing if you are on a budget you might
be looking at some of those 4690k
options for example the slightly older
Haswell or Devil's Canyon refresh if has
well in that case you would want to z97
board here's one from Asus this is over
on new egg and this one is a updated
version for z97 which means it's got the
USB 3.1 it is LGA 1150 so don't buy this
we're going for a skylake processor it's
got like m2 in there and it includes a
$40 million rebate card so five bucks
cheaper than that z170 board $95 total
after that mail-in rebate card nice for
a an asus z97 board asus you know they
do a good job let's move on to memory
though some really fantastic memory
deals actually got the pointed to
several of these through slick deals so
I'm gonna include their link as well in
the description but here's a g.skill
ripjaws X kit for $30 to buy to buy for
gig eight gigs total ddr3 1600 which is
fine you don't need anything faster than
that unless you're relying on an eye GPU
and you might want to go faster but
thirty freaking dollars to buy for gig
that is a fantastic deal for g.skill if
you're in the ddr4 market if you've just
some jumped-up to x99 or skylake z170
for example you will want ddr4 well you
need ddr4 here's a 16 gig kit to buy
eight gigs of G scale this is the
Ripjaws 5 series which has this kind of
fancier new heatsink design and 75 bucks
for that you can get a slightly faster
version of this for like three or four
more dollars the 2400 speed and honestly
there's there's quite a few deals going
on a memory here so here's the slick
deals article on that
and this has a bunch more listed here
again this is done in the video's
description if you guys went ahead over
there and check that out because they
have a whole listing and I didn't want
to go over all them I didn't want spend
too much time on memory let's move on to
storage I only am really I should have
looked up some hard drives there was a
couple 4 terabyte hard drive deals out
there but I didn't take any of them up I
have a couple SSD deals though SanDisk
apparently is liquidating some of their
slightly older SSD stocks so you can get
the 240 gig SSD Plus which is not the
fastest SanDisk SSD by any means but
even a like mid-range SSD is going to be
night and day difference if you're
upgrading from mechanical in particular
and 240 gigs is really nice amount and
60 dollars with free shipping like buy
three of them or four I don't know buy a
few of them maybe $60 for a 240 gig SSD
again not the fastest but still quite
nice over on Adorama they have the 960
gig version this is the ultra 2 which is
a little bit faster than that and then
the Plus that we saw still not as fast
as the extreme extreme to that they have
but this one's $200 for 960 gigs granted
a little bit more expensive but a 1
terabyte or practically one terabyte SSD
is super super nice to have yeah ok I'm
and for it for those of you in chat
asking for UK deals I'm sorry I don't
have any of those lined up these are all
fairly pretty much us I don't know they
celebrated Black Friday in the UK do
they so maybe it's starting to bleed
over is it you're getting international
Black Friday shopping mania everywhere
anyway let's move on to suitcases I just
got a couple cases this one's actually
directly from the Corsair website but
they have a nice deal going it's the
obsidian 550d I'm gonna take a supporter
and just let you guys look at this
picture for a while this case has been
out it's not new by any chance but I
have actually built in this case which
is the reason I picked it out and it's
really well built
I like the obsidian series from Corsair
it has all the features you would you
would want it's got USB 3.0 on the front
plenty of room removable drive cages and
it's got the same inner frame that a lot
of the Obsidian cases use
so yeah I built in this it's really
quiet too it's got the kind of closed
off front panel anyway 80 bucks for that
I believe it also has free shipping
although don't quote me on that one I've
not shopped at the Corsair website and
then I found this little guy over at
Newegg the fantex ATX mid tower and the
end loop row em in and through I like
how a new egg puts all these words
before the actual title of the case on
everything anyway and through proem a
very full-featured case from fantex if
you guys have looked at fantex cases
they throw lots in there this is a nice
option for $60 fully black painted
interior and all that good stuff again
click the link if you want to look at
more stuff like you know it's got dust
filters and all that the build quality
on the fantex cases is not always quite
as sturdy as some of the ones that we
see from like Corsair and Coolermaster
but the trade-off is you do get a really
really nice feature set for that and 60
bucks for that one
it's very nice let's move on to power
supplies I only have one for you one
power supply but it's a good one in fact
actually the EVGA supernova 850 watt was
on sale at Newegg earlier this morning
and then it stopped at some point so
that's why I'm going with this one but
this is the supernova 650 watt which is
going to be just fine for pretty much
anyone who's not running a dual card
configuration even up to like a fury X
or 980ti
this this power supply will handle 80
plus platinum which is why I picked it
out EVGA which means that they have like
nice all-black cabling so it looks
pretty and $100 is the sale price and
then a $30 million rebate card makes it
$70 total so if you guys want a nice
solid power supply that will last you a
while through multiple builds and that
kind of thing an 80 plus platinum like
literally if you're going from a non
eighty plus rated power supply to this
and you run your PC a decent amount you
will notice like your power bill drop
efficiency is very important like that
anyway let's move on to some other stuff
outside the PC anyway if you guys want
to take all those those parts and put
them all together you could probably
build a pretty decent system I was going
to do a full build but I I was taking
too much time just getting this set up
today and I just wanted to move forward
alright let's look at some some monitors
shall we
picked out a couple ultra wines and this
is probably specifically because I have
been working on my review for this
monitor back here the Acer predator X 34
which is a beautiful monitor very
expensive in that video should be coming
out this weekend I'm working on editing
it right now but because of that and
because of the size and the resolution
of it the size and resolution I was like
man 34 inch ultra wide is a really nice
sweet spot it's big it's not as
difficult to run as a full full 4k
monitor it fills your frame of view and
it doesn't feel like some of the 1080
ultra wide so that just seemed a little
bit too small and then and whatever like
it's it's a nice size so other 34 inch
ultra woods that I have listed here this
one's from LG this is for sale over on
Adorama and it's a it's it's 600 and
then there's a $50 mail-in rebate so
five hundred and fifty dollars for this
LG 21 by nine ultra wide this one's not
curved but you know you don't really
need it to be curved and I don't know a
whole lot about this particular monitor
I just know that it's probably they're
probably all using that same IPS panel
honestly the curved and the NAM curved
ones o out of stock oh crap well sorry
guys this one's out of stock but I also
wanted to show you this Dell because it
was also a pretty nice price but it's
out of stock this one you can get down
to 650 dollars by using a code which I
had listed but I've lost track of where
I am on my my notes so yeah anyway it's
sold out so sorry it's like yes about
that I wanted to have no sold out
products in here but you know stuff all
right here's another monitor from
monoprice this is actually a monitor
that my wife is getting and I when she
was looking at it she was like is this a
good option I was like let me look
27-inch 2560 by 14 and it's IPS it's not
super it's like 60 Hertz so it's not
really fast response time but it's for
its it's for production and colored EPS
and all that kind of stuff but $250 for
27 inches you can find some other
27-inch 2560 by 1440 monitors
they are usually by like eunuchs and
some of the other brands like that some
of the Korean brands to come over which
sometimes have QC issues and that kind
of thing not our price is located in the
US and stuff so 250 for that if you
don't need the super fast response time
or refresh rate I'm sorry
60 Hertz this is a really nice panel and
it can step you up from 1080 without
necessarily breaking the bank to 50 for
that one and if you're on a budget I got
a bargain here from Acer this is over on
Amazon and this one is $100 for 24 inch
LED backlit monitor this one's not going
to be super awesome but I would say
especially if you're if you're using
anything sub 1080 right now jumping up
to this for a hundred bucks 24 inches of
decent size I think it's gonna be great
option so nice nice budget monitor
option there for anyone who's interested
some more peripherals here though this
was a really nice deal actually this one
was also available over on Amazon I
believe but they seem to have changed
the price this morning this is an audio
technica ath m50x pro monitoring
headphones really nice headphones as
well as a blue yeti mic together for one
hundred and seventy dollars that's a
hundred and twenty nine dollars off MSRP
and like I said Amazon had this for 159
earlier but it seems to have gone away
but Adorama still has it it's a nice
little combo there and anyone who's
maybe getting into streaming or
something like that you get the the mic
and you got the headphones and I think
that'd be a good option okay I noticed
that mechanical RGB keyboard seemed to
be about 20 bucks off I don't wanna say
cross the board but a lot of them
Corsairs seem to be like in the hundred
and four th dollar range instead of the
160 to 170 dollar range that they
usually are so here's the case 70 very
popular one RGB mechanical keyboard down
to 140 right now MSRP is 170 if you're
into that I'm also I just recently did a
video on this keyboard which is why I
also spotted it this is down to 150 from
I'm sorry 130 which is 30 bucks off the
price it was selling out which was 160
so if you want an actual genuine and
Cherry MX keyword seems to be a good
time to do that and
that is all yeah that's all those are
all of my tech picks again I'd like to
say I have looked at every single
website that exists on the internet and
found you all the best deals but I can't
quite say I did that I did a lot of
research though and these are all things
that I their products that I feel like
are good products their prices that I
feel are pretty compelling compared to
what's been available otherwise and
hopefully you guys have found maybe a
few deals here if you're feeling like
the pickings were slim for Black Friday
so far but remember it's just started we
got the whole weekend we got Cyber
Monday coming too so I will encourage
you guys if you're watching this video
and you have spotted something else
somewhere down in the comments please
post any ideas or deals that you might
find so that our other folks could find
those and buy things because it is it is
that season it's that time of year also
I don't forget to like this video if you
enjoyed it or found any good deals on it

tech videos you can use my Amazon
