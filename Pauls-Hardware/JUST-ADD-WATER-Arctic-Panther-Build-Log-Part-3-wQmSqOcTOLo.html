welcome everyone to arctic panther build
log part 3 I have a couple major things
to get done today one is going to be to
focus on some wiring I got to get some
sleeping done on the pump reservoir and
then I also have to fix at least one
supplemental 4 pin CPU power cable from
the power supply and I've done a sleeve
one of those I made I'm gonna start with
some cables leaving probably and also of
course I'm gonna start bending the tubes
and hopefully get the loop filled up but
before I get to any of that I have like
a little pile of boxes back here and I
have some like accessories some extra
stuff that I have been collecting some
of it I have gotten from vendors but
most of it has just been me impulse
buying stuff on like performance pcs and
Amazon so I want to go over a few of
those things but it's still in the boxes
so let's start by taking them out of the
boxes
oh yeah and I also need to blame you
guys for a lot of this stuff too because
a lot of this is some responses to stuff
that you guys said in the comments for
last video but anyway ignore most of the
stuff on the right side up here this is
this is the power supply which I'm going
to be doing an unmasking of in just a
few minutes and then sleeving Cable
saving stuff and then that's just a
random stash of stuff I've been working
with anyway though starting from the top
primo flex just some flexible tubing
from primo gel cuz hey I realized I
didn't really have any of this and when
you need some flexible tubing and all
you have is hardline stuff it's nice to
have some flex tubing from Mayhem's I
have two things this is the Blitz
cleaning kit just nice to have that for
cleaning out stuff if you need to do
really thorough cleaning the full system
I've never used it before but I've read
about it and stuff in it does a really
good job so then also from Mayhem's I
have a piece pH testing kits which may
come in handy in the future impulse buys
yeah good to have this just doing here
this is this is for nori oh now what's
this
add a new bone sit good girl sit pretty
is it pretty good girl there you go
yeah run away and make out with it here
I was interested to hear oh here doesn't
like chew toys he doesn't really have
many teeth to chew them with so there it
is anyway I'm getting distracted how
could I not just look at her okay back
to her old one is uh not doing very good
moving along this already had this is
from exit XS PC and it is a just a cable
cable chopper that's what I'm gonna call
it I'm gonna call - chopper very sharp
tested out already there's a really good
job cutting the ptg really cleanly so um
it helps speed things along
alright I got a set of micro files and
needle files I guess is what these are
called file a lot of this fine file a
lot of quite a lot of this stuff under
would have been convenient to have
already but now I have them so they go
big ol stack of sandpaper cuz same
papers apparently I'm into sandpaper now
got this kind of last minute I wanted to
have a temperature sensor and I
completely forgot to order one so I
needed to find something on Amazon that
we're gonna get here quickly so this is
a g1 quarter plug with 10k sensors so
the sensor is actually in the plug there
so I can just put that cap anywhere in a
system that has water from the system up
against it and I'll be able to tell the
temperature then the other side I can
just plug into one of the thermal probe
connection points on the motherboard the
box underneath is a 4 terabyte WD hard
drive because I needed to have a $35
more order to get this to ship quickly
and 4 terabyte hard drive right
alright this was sent directly from
primo chill let me see if I can swish it
around and this is a reaction to Jay's
video on this so thanks pretty much know
for sending this over this is their view
fluid still there it's still in
development but it looks really cool
it's got kind of that shampoo effect so
I'm gonna maybe test that out and see
how it looks in there also I'll so it's
pretty much ill orderic so it came with
sour patch kids
okay whoever shot my sander before it
wasn't a real sander and now I have an
actual sanding block that should be
convenient and helpful got some tap
magic stuff since I've been drilling
into metal useful to have this for
lubricating things and making sure it
doesn't get too hot and keep getting a
clean cut I got some nitrile gloves
since I've been complaining about
getting fingerprints on things I can
wear the gloves now and that's super
helpful for a wide variety of things I'm
really I've been meaning to get those
for quite some time come back to those
in a second I wanted a funnel and they
had G 1 quarter funnels
this one's from coolants the liquid
funnel with adapter so it's got a G 1/4
threading on the bottom and it's kind of
squishy smaller than I thought it was
gonna be but it also comes with a little
tube that you can feed down in there in
order to let the air out so if you don't
have a place where air can escape this
can be very helpful while filling your
loop
I see ideas that I'll just stick it
right there screw it on there and be
good to go for the pour the fluid right
in now this I didn't buy this this I've
had it's it's my pin extractor which
I've use for modding my my power supply
over here for example but since these
are delicate and they can't break and
since I actually wanted the pin
extractor for molex we just got a kit
that comes to the molex pin extractor as
well as pin extraction tools for several
other types of plugs in the PC including
replacements or a backup for my standard
PCIe pin extraction tool right there so
that's nice to have speaking of pins Wow
these are standard molex ATX PCIe power
pins the same type of pins that are used
in pretty much all the motherboard EPS
and PCI Express power plugs these are
really expensive for some reason they I
feel like I should go and buy these when
I'm in Taiwan next time and getting
really cheap in Amite I have a set of
those now so those that's a backup in
case a break a pin as I'm doing a bit of
the modding here also I didn't have one
of these I borrowed the one from from
Kyle last time who is a crimping tool so
that when you're actually attaching
these pins to the cables use the
crimping tool to crimp them in place and
that means that I can basically make
any cable I want of any length I wants
and replaced pins on broken pins on the
end and that kind of thing so that
should be really helpful and finally
finishing out my tools
I got a center punch which is very
helpful for drawing into metal and
starting out stuff and then uh okay
steps drill bits set yeah hey so many
people as I was drilling the holes for
the fill and drain ports on the define
are five over there in the last video I
like Paul you need a step drill bit set
so or at least at least a step drill bit
I got a full set I can go up to all the
way up to one and three-eighths inch and
they're like coal bolts or something and
they come with this case that makes you
feel like it's totally worth the money
because look I mean it's got a nice
fancy case anyway and that is all these
stuff that I just bought can recently so
I'll post links to all this stuff down
in the video's description if you are
interested in any of them and let's move
on and start some cable sleeving
I'm attempting to harvest a 4-pin CPI
connector from this old modular cable
and I'm not doing a very good job at it
pretty much mangled this one I got piece
of it a piece of it stuck inside so I'm
seeing if I can do the other one instead
so I want to get this power supply
situation resolved and here's my dilemma
I need another 4 pin supplemental CPU
power connector here the ATX 12 volt as
it's more commonly known my problem is
from my outs on the back here everything
that's hardwired is hardwired I can't
and there's no there's nothing else
available there I've got two of these
white eight pin outputs and those are
actually made for ATX 12 volts and PCIe
but what I did in the original build was
I took my two PCI Express power cables
or my graphics cards because I have two
of them to eight pins commands that are
hardwired and then have two more that I
made the cables for here and those are
gonna be using up to those two plugs so
I have all my peripheral connectors here
and this is a you know it's a big old
power supply it can handle the the juice
it's got the juice that it needs but
it's got a single 12 volt rail too so no
matter what my 12 volt connectors are in
here I will be connecting through that
12 volt rail now quick disclaimer this
is not meant to be a tutorial or
anything like that so please don't go
poking around with your power supply
wiring and circuitry unless you know at
least a little bit what you're doing
don't take my word for it but basically
what I did was I took one of my
peripheral cables that I made last time
because I know I did it right the first
time these were functional and I back
traced the connectors here for the
Meseta connection points caseta has a 12
volt 5 volt and a 3.3 volt and I traced
that back to the actual 16 connectors
for the peripherals on there and I
figured out according to that I've got
two grounds three point three five volt
and twelve volt I want that 12 volt but
I want to 12 volts and I'd rather not go
splicing off of a single one because
kind of the point of the 18 gauge wires
going to each 12 volt rails each one can
only support a certain amount of
amperage and you don't want to go over
that so splicing them isn't the best
solution so first answer question one
because there are pins in all six of the
each of these slots there
yeah there's pins and all of them so
mystery unused pin but any of their
peripheral cables what is that that's
another 12 volt maybe I can just connect
up to that so I've got my black lead
connected to ground power supply is now
on because I've got a hot-wired and just
to double-check my chart
the top right should be 3.3 volts 3.3
volts good the bottom left should be our
12 volt cool 0.3 it can be a variance of
about 5 plus or minus 5% pretty standard
and then 5 volts should be bottom right
there we go there's a 5 volt and then
bottom middle - no that's a no juice
that's probably just another ground or
it might just be a dummy not connected
to anything because right now we're
getting like 35 it's climbing all right
this is getting my beyond my knowledge
of explaining that but basically I can't
use that I can't use that bottom extra
connector the upshot here is that I'm
gonna need to use two of these
peripheral outs to go into my single for
pin power connector but that's that's
okay I have three peripheral cables that
I made originally that I don't really
need so much anymore I only really need
a molex connector for the pump in there
so these I'm probably just gonna set
aside and save I'll use some of the
original cables that I still have
Salvage to pull the caps off of that and
then I'm sleeping yes all right sleeping
cables here goes
all right so I've made the weirdest warp
in ATX CPU power plug ever it goes into
two of those peripheral cables into the
power supply and the power supply side
the plugs are reversed on each of these
if you look at the colors just because I
wanted the plug on top which you might
be able to vaguely see through the top
of the computer to be alternating kind
of like that you know so aesthetics of
course but two plugs on the power supply
side or pins on this side let's give it
let's give a quick test the two top ones
should be 12 volts and the two bottoms
should be ground 12 volts yay so volts
again yay let's try the other ground all
right 12 volts and 12 volts it's like
we're good
and here is my completed sleeves cabling
for my D DC pump and this is the part
I'm least enthusiastic about I was not I
need some like wider gauge he trick
because this was not wide enough I tried
to work it all the way up there to get
to the end but it just it gets wider
there cuz I'd already put some other
heat shrink down there so that's as far
as I got
it's not very clean right where it meets
the pump that's gonna be facing the back
so I'm okay with it
also this huge string comes a little bit
further than I want to want it but again
that's it's gonna be hidden so no no big
deal I did two wires per sleeve to keep
things just a little bit tight here and
with all black mainly because like
that's when I have the most stuff left
over now and then here's my two end
plugs I did replace the white caps that
were on they before was black and I used
some heat-shrink stretched it out to go
around the end of that one cuz that will
be somewhat visible plugged into the
motherboard and then the molex plug on
the other side also replaced with a
black cap and again some not the
prettiest heat shrink down in there to
cap things off but hold things in place
and now I think I can finally if I
install my power supply yeah a power
supply progress so some last-minute
logistics before things get too crowded
in there because I need to make sure
everything's plugged in I've got front
panel connected already USB and all that
good stuff as well as power reset now
what I've got to worry about her fans so
I have I was gonna have a bunch of these
little splitters or at least a few of
these little splitters but I ended up
only needing one there's actually seven
fan headers on this motherboard so two
of them are right down here and these
two fans are plugged into that two of
them for the CPU in the top left I'm
going to plug those two
into that there are three in the lower
right hand corner so the two front fans
are gonna go into a one front fans going
to go in one of those and I'm going to
split off one of those for that this fan
as well as the bottom intake fan that
will leave one more and that's a pump
header fan down there and that one's
going to connect up to the PWM plug for
the pump I also realize I had my ROG SLI
bridge here which lights up of course
and that has a separate little cable
that comes off of it and I completely
lost track of that cable and I thought
that the entire build was going to be
ruined but fortunately I found it at the
last minute and it has a splitter and
the end so it doesn't actually eat up an
entire RGB out on the motherboard so I
can plug it in and then also plug in an
RGB strip to it so get an RGB strip set
up to be at least down here in the
bottom but there's also that digital RGB
header I don't have a digital RGB LED
strip yet but I am gonna take the cable
for that because there's a special cable
for it that only has three pins so I'm
gonna plug that in and have that wired
I've gone to the back so if I do get one
of those digital RGB strips I can plug
it in and I won't have to worry about
accessing the head around the
motherboard once I get the RGB wires
wired up through back there which I'm
gonna start actually getting some glue
getting oh no it's dripping others
horrible damaged glue gun it's a boogers
just got on my newly sleeved cable since
it's not cool okay sorry so because this
little plug right here and the cable
comes off at a really weird kind of
inconvenience spot aesthetically just
kind of kind of fold it back here and
use my glue gun hold it in place
hopefully I'm sure this is standard
operating procedure
oh that's too much it's okay if folded
the threading inside the fill port is
different than the threading it's this
is g1 quarter this is just a thicker
gauge threading for the fill port so I
can't use my fancy filler up again
plan B
at my first leak almost immediately that
will teach me to go forward without
putting paper towels down in case of
leaks but it was the cap that I had on
the reservoir pump right there and
although aesthetically pleasing these
black caps from ek should only really be
used to cap off flat G in one quarter
fittings whereas this one's recessed so
it wasn't sealed right there and it
started dripping down I have paper
towels ready now though so let's
continue so look at the flow indicator
is flowing so guys let me I mean I need
to wrap up this video this video has
taken more like three days as far as the
actual amount of work I've put into the
build of course a lot of that had to do
with filming it and whatnot and also
overcoming obstacles and dilemmas I've
learned some special important things I
need to give a shout-out to Richard aka
Darth Beavis when it comes to bending
this thicker stuff thicker 16-millimeter
ptg tubing it's just a bit more
challenging you have to warm up a bit
more of it and everything and his video
and just actually watching him do it
just as far as how aggressive he is with
getting the heat on there as long as
you're careful of course to avoid
bubbles and everything the super helpful
so thanks Richard for that video and
that I'll post like that one in the
description beyond that I did discover a
new technique that I developed or I have
no idea this is a normal technique or
not but it's basically that as I'm
bending when when you know when it's got
the insert in there and everything and
it's warm and I'm bending and if it
starts to bubble up or something like
that I was taking one of these soft
cloths basically just wrapping with it
and like holding it so I was like
squeezing the bubble back down with my
hand and then waiting for it to cool off
a little bit and I was actually able to
salvage several pieces that way which
was which was useful because when you're
bending ptg tubing it's a very fine line
to go from this is an absolutely vital
integral part of my build that I must
protect now at all
- this is a piece of scrap plastic that
I'm not throwing away and I hate this
Bend was what basically killed my
evening last night because I had had
everything set up I got all the bends
done I had them all in place I just
didn't have the fitting caps on all of
them so I went to do that really quick
last night finish it up and then I was
going to pour some watering because I
promised you guys that I have water in
it by the end of today's video this was
what I called my J bend and I had
actually replaced it right down there
and it looked it looked pretty cool when
it was in there
it helped me not use quite as many
fittings to get this vertical part right
here but when I attempted to actually
put the cap on the end just just didn't
want to go in there and that's because
this is part of the bend right there and
so the uniformity of the roundness of
the tubing had been warped and therefore
the cap wouldn't go on so I tried to
salvage it started sanding it down and
whatnot and eventually I was just like I
hate it now and it sucks so I had to
scrap that piece and go back to my
original plan of using a few adapters on
there now I have water in it as you guys
can see it's percolating it's bubbling a
little bit you can hear the pump this is
a DDC pump it's it's a good pump DVC
pumps to make a little bit more noise in
the defect so I'm getting used to that
beyond that though was mostly leak free
except for a little cap on the pump
reservoir down there that I had to
replace to get that to fit in there of
course this is just distilled water in
there right now I'm just gonna let it
run and do some leak testing and make
sure there's no leaks and then for part
3 I have lots of things still to do of
course several of you notice that my
cables need some training I'm still in
the process of doing that and I still
have more work to do there but I needed
to get water in this system I can't do a
part 3 of a water-cooled build and not
actually have water in the system so
good water in the system but I guess
when it comes down to it my goal was
really just to get water in the system
for today's video as I promised you guys
so I've done that I hope you guys are
liking the look of it so far I'm pretty
stoked with it I'm happy I'm happy with
what I got going on here so far if you
guys are happy - if you think it's
looking good thumbs up button on your
way out of course and leave me a comment
in the comment section I've been getting
a lot of feedback from you guys on this
build and has been impacting my
decisions in certain areas so
keep that coming thanks again for
watching this video guys and we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
