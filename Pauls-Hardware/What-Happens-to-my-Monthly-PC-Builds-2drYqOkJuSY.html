in today's video I'm going to be
answering a question that I get asked
all the time since I build systems
computers here on my channel pretty much
every month I end up with lots of
computers and obviously no one in the
right mind is going to use a different
new computer every single month every
that'd be silly okay I do that sometimes
but I still end up with computers that I
don't really have that much use for
personally so everyone always always ask
me Paul what do you do with all of these
computers that you build so in today's
video I am going to be showing you a
specific case scenario of a very
specific computer that I built just a
week or two ago my February bill that's
right here behind me and I'm gonna show
you the disposition of this computer and
that now that I'm finished doing the
actual videos on it which would be the
build video and the testing video which
I'll link in the description if you guys
want to check that out so basically the
plan for this system is to hand down at
least most of it to Jennifer who you
guys might remember I used to work with
her at new ink TV back in the day along
with Kyle and our good friend Steve and
she is now doing well she does lots of
stuff but she's actually been helping me
out on the business side coordinating
some sponsorships and helping me set up
for events that I go to and everything
like CES and Computex which she has been
immensely helpful with so she is
definitely in need of a new system at
home a bit of an upgrade something to do
a little bit better job of gaming I
think she wants to be able to game in
the living room and and this should be
able to do a good job of that
now the parts in here that I can't let
her have because I still need them are
the 7700 K the processor because that's
an engineering sample it's also my only
77 out of K right now since I'm giving
away the 7700 cadence in that system the
32 gigs of memory she doesn't need quite
that much and a 2 by 16 gig kit of
Dominator Platinum's is something that I
do want to have on hand for the future
unfortunately she also can't have my 600
P SSD my intel SSD cuz I'm planning to
do some drive comparisons of nvme SSDs
in the future and she also can't have
the 1080 because this is my 400 Edition
1080 which is also my only founders
Edition 1080 and I needed so
so up in to gtx 960 instead of that she
has memory so that's cool
she also has a 6700 K I believe so she's
gonna swap that in the Corsair cooler
the H 100 IV - I'm also going to be
pulling out because it's my only H 100
IV - and it's a very common cooler to be
used in a lot of different situations
actually I believe I have another build
coming up that I need to add that into
and I will be adding a knock to a cooler
that's gonna fit right in there and that
will also hopefully be a good
replacement for her since back in the
day when we were still at Newegg she had
a knock to a cooler and I stole her n FF
12 so anyway all that said let's let's
pull all the stuff out of here that I'm
not going to be taking along
okay so progress has been made h100 eye
has been removed and then of course
you've also removed GPU memory and SSDs
so basically what we got here is the
case power supply the Noctua fans here
that I'm leaving in there because they
fit so nicely in this case doesn't ship
with fans so you got to add those
motherboard still installed of course
and I have removed the 7700 K and I put
a CPU slot cover on there to keep it
protected during transportation but I do
have some some problems some dilemmas
that I've run into first off is that my
Knock to a cooler here which is the Nhu
12s special edition is a special edition
and literally only came with AM form
outs so I cannot I cannot install this
in an intel socket at least not in its
current state so that sucks but honestly
it wouldn't even matter because we're
dealing with some clearance issues to
their obviously this is a little bit too
tall so there's options first option
just so we can have a functional system
for Jennifer is to just use the stock
Intel eat sync fan which I will be
bringing just so I can have something to
drop on there alternatively we might
like to stop by Fry's or something like
that see if we can get a lower profile
cooler that can fit in there also my my
back plate still on there I do need to
pull that back plate off that might be
annoying
I guess so those are a couple dilemmas
we need to deal with
and then the final dilemma I guess I
need to deal with is of course
delivering this system and that's to
Jennifer and she's living in Vegas right
now so I guess we're going to Vegas
hey hey Steve you know go to Vegas yeah
like crazy
safety was not often it was embarrassed
jams put the safety back
rounds jams in there like really bad
you
Oh
Oh wake up we got to go man all right
let's go we gotta go man come on get up
go where oh yeah hi Jamie
I fall okay so we have most we have
pretty much all of the computer now by
combining both of our pairs but it means
we need to make a quick decision here
which is I brought you I brought two
graphics cards don't worry it's just a
stock heatsink man in a second all right
so we got EVGA 10 16 or the gigabyte
1060 what do you think this one's a
little bit longer
let's go what's smaller we're gonna go
in this okay and then of course you guys
are you saw everything that's in there
we got the case power supply and then
this is the system that we are
attempting to reconfigure and this
motherboard actually needs some testing
because Jennifer had an unfortunate
issue with the graphics card Catching
Fire which happens from time to time
yeah so we got six and seven out of K
you can drop in the memory actually we
still have dominated platinum memory I
didn't realize and then of course the
m-dot to the Mishkan right here so
that's a 250 gig SSD to drop in there as
well
to use that perfect okay this this is
how you take a build like the builds of
me and Kyle do and we take them and we
hopefully make better use out of them so
I guess you guys should all be friends
with us another chance a except Kyle he
he doesn't he doesn't is screw you Paul
alright so guys the plan was actually to
do a quick parking lot build right here
and assembled all of it all of this but
for the sake of brevity we're gonna cut
this off because we actually need to get
back down scrap yard borders like very
soon I'm just gonna I feel like this has
been an equitable trade yes this is work
that so Jenny got most of the computer I
had said about like five 4/7 something
like that I've got a maxima state here
motherboard that I'm gonna test out and
see if it's functional and you guys
hopefully got a video I hope you enjoyed
this video and I was a little bit random
little weird but you know we got through
it okay and I'm glad you guys were able
to come along for the ride
Jen you're so good to see you and guys
thumbs up button
say hi to Jenny that had no it's been a
while since she's been around but she's
been doing a great job helping me out on
the channel so more content and more
good stuff coming at you guys and it's
even better yeah alright thanks for
watching guys see you next then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
