in Taiwan for Computex Kyle tweeted a
picture of he and his wife and it was
raining and they didn't have umbrellas
and I tweeted a snarky response back
because they should be very well aware
that they need umbrellas in Taiwan in
early June because they've been going
there for context for like seven plus
years I think
but then Jay also known as Jay's $0.02
responded to my tweet and said ah I
really like the new I don't give a
version of Paul and I was like all right
that's kind of new but maybe I should go
with this let's let's try this new
attitude out for a little bit to that
end
Oh God this is the brand new asus rog
swift pg3 5v ultra wide gaming monitor
g-sync ultimate support and 200 Hertz
for fresh rates it is going to cost a
lot about twenty five hundred dollars
according to Asus Asus said that they
really only sent a couple of these out
for review to me and Linus tech tips so
just want to point out the by comparison
your monitor is horrible I have this and
you don't so suck it
cooler masters SF series fans feature
addressable RGB LEDs and a square design
to maximize fan mount coverage and
generate high pressure air flow
available in standard hundred twenty
millimeter size as the SF 120 P as well
as the dual fan 240 millimeter option in
the SF 240p a RGB cooler master has
integrated multiple layers of noise
reduction technology and an optimized
fan blade design into this series so
click the sponsor link in the
description to learn more
that's a heavy monitor choose this is an
ultra-wide monitor very popular for
gaming the ultra wide monitors are I I
really like this ultra wide size the
form factor just because it gives you
more wrap around having a slight
curvature is also nice this has 1800 our
curvature it's 35 inches measured
diagonally from corner to corner to
corner the resolution is 34 40 by 1440
which is a good resolution that is
significantly better than 1080 or ultra
wide 1080 but still fewer pixels in 4k
which means you can get higher frame
rates or more FPS with less power from
your graphics card that's sort of a
general description but it does have
external RGB lighting one in this
display right here and then it's got the
downward projecting RGB ROG logo both of
those can be controlled via the Asus or
a software also one more our og logo
right there on top of the stand if
you're special like me and you have this
monitor you also get a big old box of
accessories starting with a better ring
or no this is actually an additional
panel you can put on the back after you
get everything wired up with your cables
you want it to look pretty so that is a
cover I'll show you how that goes on in
just a second we have some paperwork
also to confirm how awesome I am for
having this monitor I am an Asus VIP
this is just to notify me of that and
then we have also I'm part of the elite
Republic of gamers community now which
has tons of perks as outlined in this
this also has a sort of a QuickStart
guide as well safety info you get this
squishy pouch stash bag for storing your
mustaches also in that is these ROG
logos and I've never actually had an
asus rog monitored that has a downward
firing thing but it doesn't come
pre-installed so that pops on the back
and then the light shines through this
so you can swap that out for a different
RG pattern if you want to or they
provide you with some blanks so you can
make your own also included in the Box
is this color calibration testing report
because this monitor actually is really
good color reproduction it has 1000 nits
of brightness 90% of the DCI p3 color
space can be represented so that's the
10 billion colors 10 big gamut although
it can accept a 12 bit input signal and
then Delta e less than two color
calibrations so they're basically
guaranteeing a very high level of color
accuracy out of the box because they
individually calibrates each monitor
before
chips from the factory I tend to be
critical of monitors when it comes to
stands because I think a monitor should
either ship with a good stand or have a
vase amount ideally it should have both
this monitor does have both which
includes a nice stand but also these
stand offs because it does have a
standard base amount but it's recessed
so you'll need these standoffs in order
to use that standard base amount so if
you do decide to put it on a swing arm
or wall-mounted or something like that
you do have support for that good job'
suits including those in the package it
does have a fairly large external power
brick and in fact this monitor has three
internal cooling fans as well that Asus
has done some work to make sure that
they ramp up and down at the right speed
to make sure things are staying cool
while also minimizing the amounts of
noise that's generated big power brick
so you're going to need to find a spot
for that the plus side of having an
external power brick is that if it fails
or something like that you can replace
it without having to replace the entire
monitor and they do include both sides
of cables so that's nice too and lastly
we have three included cables an HDMI
and it can do up to 100 Hertz at full
resolution via HDMI display port where
you can get up to 200 Hertz so if you're
gaming you want to be connecting via
DisplayPort ideally to an Nvidia
graphics card and then finally there is
a USB extension because it does have an
integrated USB hub not just a USB hub
though they have also integrated a sound
card basically into this monitor it has
an integrated ESS ESS on fire that
supports audio output at up to 24 bit
192 kilohertz which means that yes you
can plug into the 3.5 millimeter jack on
this monitor and still get good sound
and it also allows you the convenience
of connecting up via HDMI and just
having the single cable for sound just
bear in mind if you're doing HDMI and
going through the headphone jack you're
limited to 16 bit 48 kilohertz if you
really want to fully make use of the
integrated sound card you want to
connect via USB
I've laid the monitor flat here just for
a second so we can handle a few things
there's a Kensington lock I always like
to point that out and back here we have
some designs you know apart from the
lighting which I'm gonna plug in in just
a second and show you I mean this really
cool aesthetic design on the back of
your monitor and some of you might be
thinking and it's setec design on the
back of the monitor I'm never going to
see that but those of us who own a
monitor of this caliber and quality know
that it really is what sets it apart
from the rest that's available and you
know just gives you that feeling of
superiority
back here you have the IO there's an
HDMI and a DisplayPort out and then
there's the USB input there's a couple
USB 3.0 ports back there it's pretty
much all apart from connecting up power
as well and then you can route those
cables back through the stand where
there's a little port that helps keep
the cable management nice and tidy
speaking of the stand down here at the
bottom we haven't installed the ROG logo
we've just going with the default one
for now
and just been routing the cables up so
that we can plug stuff in and do some
testing with this monitor also wanted to
show you guys how this panel pops on
just like this and look look how much
cleaner that is all of you guys probably
don't have this feature on your monitor
which is why this one is better I
actually can put the downward firing
logo on while you're installing the
monitors base and stand which is what
you're supposed to do but also I want to
point out there's a little cap over the
lens here that you're supposed to remove
somehow somehow oh there we go now
normally I don't spend too much time on
gratuitous sexy b-roll footage in my
videos but for this monitor hey why not
make an exception so a few things you
might notice physically about this
monitor one is that asus is still
calling monitors bezel lists even though
it has clearly about a quarter-inch
bezel around the entire outside I guess
that's a trend that's just going to
continue but I just want to point out
this is not an edge-to-edge screen and I
don't know why they're trying to tell
you that it is the stand apart from
having those fancy chrome accents as
well as the downer firing LED does have
height tilt and swivel adjustment which
is just about all you can expect for an
ultra wide and I will also note that it
doesn't cost a thousand dollars extra
the only other things physically about
this monitor I wanted to point out it
that the controls are sort of tucked
around the back right side and there is
a joystick to allow you to navigate
through them which is pretty convenient
they're pretty easy to get to and not
too difficult to navigate through the
menus with and I wanted to point out
that for all the extra effort that Asus
went through to give you a better sound
solution for this and I have been
testing it and it does sound better I
can't really show you guys that because
you're listening to it through your own
sound devices but it does sound better
though if you plug in via a USB and go
via the included ESS amplifier but if
they really wanted people to use this
they should have repositioned the
headphone jack it's still positioned
back there
all of the video in and outs which means
that if you put this cover on you can't
get at it
moving on to some testing though and for
the sake of comparison I've set this up
side by side with my lg monitor which is
the 3/4 GK 950 F which is 144 Hertz
monitor it's 34 inches rather than 35
inches so just slightly smaller but the
same resolution 34 40 by 1440 it
supports free sync - as well as HDR 400
so the lesser variant of the HDR 1000
that the asus monitor supports when it
comes to setting up the PG 3 5 V it will
run at 180 Hertz max out of the box so
you do need to jump into the menu and go
to the overclocking function which is
the first thing on there to turn on 200
Hertz mode to get full range of 1 to 200
Hertz G seek support which is a nice
feature especially if you dip into the
really low frame rates at sports down to
1 Hertz for fresh which would be awkward
but they're good to have the full
spectrum supported there it does also
have a blue light filter built-in levels
0 through 4 supported and then there's
some game visual modes that you can
access if you're not in HDR mode racing
mode will get you the fastest response
time I did most of my testing and srgb
except for my click to response time
that I'll get to in just a second also
if you go in the image menu you'll find
an overdrive function and one of the
things that I noticed as I was doing
side by side testing was some more
noticeable ghosting with the asus
monitor as compared to the LG they're
supposed to have similar pixel response
times in the 4 millisecond range but i
did notice when the asus monitor had
overdrive off there was noticeable
ghosting you can't turn an overdrive
mode to normal or extreme normal did
reduce that ghosting a bit so that's
probably the mode of playing we went to
extreme though it went a little bit too
far and it caused a corona effect which
is kind of inverse ghosting that
hopefully you can see in some of these
slow-mo frames all that is to say though
from a direct panel to panel comparison
there's definitely a little bit worse
ghosting on the asus then on the LG
which is kind of disappointing because
LG monitor is currently available for a
little bit less than $1,000 which is a
lot less to the about $2,500 expected
retail price of the Asus another
function available in the menus is the
variable backlight it has a 512 zone
backlight with full area local dimming
since it's a VA panel that it's using it
does still need a backlight and 512 zone
is just about as good as you can get
unless you go all the way to oh le d
that said you can adjust how fast or
slow the
zones actually light up or dim down but
I did notice some haloing happening
which is one of the negative sides of a
full area local dimming back light like
this one and that just means that when
there's extremely high contrast you
might see certain areas of the screen
light up because you can actually see
the backlight lighting up so if you're
looking at a very dark image with small
points of light you might see halos
around them I've run it through the LG
chess 4k demo which is supposed to call
this out a little bit more fortunately
when watching video or playing games
this effect is really not very
noticeable I had to sort of tease it out
by setting the background to gray and
moving a window around it here you can
really see when the back lights light up
and dim but again in practice it wasn't
that noticeable just something that some
people who are prettier about their
displays especially if you're spending
2500 bucks on one might notice just
rounding out going down the menu there's
a game plus menu that allows you to put
a crosshair or a timer or FPS counter
overlay on the screen asus has been
doing that for a while it is available
in this monitor too and then if you go
into the system setup menu can go to the
light in motion or a sync or or RGB
functions and those are what's going to
allow you to manually control the LEDs
that's on the back of the monitor the
downward firing LED that lights up the
desk underneath the monitors stand and
you can actually set those to specific
colors there's a few basic effects that
are available in there or you can just
switch over to aura sync mode in which
case if you have the USB plugged in you
can use the aura sync software to
synchronize everything up with your
computer and the RGB LEDs that you no
doubt have installed there last thing I
wanted to mention here is it's in the
setup menu you can go and tell it
whether it's going to use the HDMI
pass-through with the integrated audio
just as is which will get you lower
sound quality or you can plug in via the
USB have it recognize it as a sound
device on your system
that's what you're already using it that
way I would recommend that if you are
planning on passing your audio through
the monitor because it definitely does
improve the audio quality again it's
subjective I can't really show you guys
that because it's just me listening to
the headphones but yes that is
definitely the way to go speaking of
tests that I can't really show you
because you guys may or may not be
actually using HDR monitors and this
isn't going to be an HDR video anyway is
display HDR 1000 support from everyone
who I've spoken to and I have very
limited experience with HDR getting the
brightness up as high as you can is very
important and a thousand nits of
brightness is the on the high end I'm
actually very high-end
comes to a monitor most monitors you'll
see you're down in the 250 to 400 range
that is what allows it to hit that
display HDR 1000 spec that's also what
gives it the g-sync ultimate support
because that's like g-sync with extra
sauce which is basically HDR support in
HDR 1000 and here's where I definitely
noticed an improvement with the Asus
monitor compared to the LG and that
simply due to the high dynamic range
being worse on the LG I noticed a lot
more colors being washed out as using
Austin Evans iPhone 10 video which is
available in HD are the 4k on YouTube
and you can just see a lot more normal
gradation of tones on the Asus monitor
as I noticed things were a lot more
washed out on the LG so when it comes to
HDR support I think that's definitely an
area where this monitor shines I'm still
developing my monitor testing techniques
but I wanted to do a click to response
time test using a Heim framerate
recording with the camera that I have
which can go up to 180 frames per second
so basically in my admittedly limited
test the asus monitor took about 23
frames to actually show a response
versus the LG which took about 14 frames
to show a response that's out of 180
frames total it was recording per second
so according to my calculations that's
about 80 milliseconds of input lag on
the LG and about 120 125 milliseconds of
input lag on the Asus so the LG was a
little bit faster in that respect as
well finally we just did some live
gameplay testing I had Joe test out Apex
legends because you can actually play it
an ultra wide although it is stretched
at the edges but he noticed a lot more
smoothness even compared going from the
144 Hertz from the LG to the 200 Hertz
for the asus and he was gonna win both
matches he won the match he played
originally on the LG monitor and that
just goes to show more frames obviously
makes you a better gamer and then I
think he was gonna win the one he was
playing on the asus monitor - except for
the system froze up i have no idea if
that was because i have the new windows
1903 update or something to do with HDR
or the dual monitors or if arctic
panther just decided to take a crap on
me i'm not sure but it's definitely
worth repeating that playing 200 Hertz g
sync is a buttery smooth gaming
experience especially for an FPS game i
did a little bit of gaming too i played
some overwatch which is kind of silly
because it doesn't support ultra wide
unless you crop it which is you
I want to do anyway but still even if
you're playing a sixteen by nine game
you're still taking advantage of the
high refresh rate and everything so I
would say still worth playing
although Metro is probably made a little
bit more sense because I could actually
play that in ultra-wide let me try to
sum up this video for you guys if I can
this monitor is absolutely awesome for
gaming and hopefully some of my testing
has brought that across to you is it
worth the price that Asus is charging
for it right at launch of about twenty
five hundred dollars u.s. probably not
for most people just because that's very
expensive that's a lot more than most
people I think spend on a monitor but I
think there's a niche of people with the
money who have been waiting for this
confluence of features that being the
form factor ultra wide the size the
resolution the super high refresh rate
at 200 Hertz with g-sync
as well as the color act accuracy which
I don't think we've really seen in a
monitor of this caliber I think what
Asus maybe should have done is cut down
on some of the extra features of this
monitor like all the RGB stuff on the
back the housing that stuff looks really
cool let's be honest it makes me feel
happy a little bit but ultimately in
most situations it's gonna be facing the
wall like it is right here and you're
never gonna see it again same goes for
having a artfully design stand with the
downward firing led logo
I mean sure monitor stands are very
expensive these days and can sell for
upwards of a thousand dollars or so I've
heard but I feel like cases could have
cut back on some of that stuff maybe not
worried about the integrated audio and
cut down on the price and made it a
little bit more reasonable for some
people and who knows maybe Asus will
make a slightly cut-down version of this
monitor that uses the panel technology
but remove some of that other stuff and
makes the price a little bit less who
knows my negatives for this monitor are
definitely going to be the haloing
that's happening from the backlight the
ghosting that's happening it was a
really bad ghost thing I want to point
that out it's only good bad ghosting cuz
I'm comparing it to this lg monitor as
really next to no ghosting and then I
think the input lag could be improved a
bit as well
but overall the gaming experience on
this monitor is absolutely amazing same
goes for media playback so if you guys
are looking for a monitor and you've got
the money definitely consider this one
but I would keep an eye out as well for
alternatives that might have a very
similar set of features as this asus
monitor that maybe aren't the
over-the-top super premium urged
with lots of RGB LEDs and everything
that tends to cost a little bit more I'm
hoping that this technology will be more
accessible for more people in the future
and that way I won't have to make videos
like this where I simply gloat and point
out to you guys that I have this and you
don't for now yes that's all I can do so
guys if you enjoyed this video please
hit the thumbs up button if you enjoyed
my slightly different take on an
approach then you know let me know that
in the comments section below as well
and we'll see you guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
