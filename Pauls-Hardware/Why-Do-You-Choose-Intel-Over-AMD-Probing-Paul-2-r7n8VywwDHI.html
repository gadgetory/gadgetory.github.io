Pauls hardware this is my monthly Q&amp;amp;A
video which I am now gonna be calling
probing Paul thanks to your valuable
feedback it's a title that I I don't
know I'm okay with it I'm warming up to
it I think a little bit at a time if
you'll notice there's kind of a blue
glow reflecting down here that's because
I have just finished in my video on the
Maximus 8 formula motherboard from Asus
which is actually I don't even know if I
can lift this it's actually running
right now it's plugged in running I just
all right let's I'll just leave that
there for now anyway if you guys want to
ask me questions for my monthly probing
Paul Q&amp;amp;A video for next month for
example you can post comments in this
videos comments section that is where I
got some of the questions for this video
this is a this was last month's right
here there's Kyle looking all young I
also notice since it was titled boxers
or briefs there were some very
interesting suggested videos over on the
side but anyway I got a bunch of
questions from there I asked on Twitter
and I got several more from there and
I'm going to try to run through these
fairly quickly to give you guys answers
to your questions that's how this video
is supposed to work anyway I'm just a
representation of just one of the many
requests to change the title of this
series to probing Paul so thank you to
everyone who suggested that and voted
for that anyway the first real actual
question is from tech showdown who also
has a YouTube channel you should check
it out he does tech reviews what do you
think of tech reviewers being bought out
like game reviewers and my answer to him
immediately was I think that's pretty
pretty despicable in particular there
was drama with like machinima back in
the day and that kind of thing but um it
now apparently has happened with some
tech reviewers as well I don't know any
of any specific specific situations
where it's happened but um I would say
as a viewer of the content you should
definitely keep your eye out for some
key things one is does the person
reviewing the product disclose where
they got the product from yes or no I
always try to say if I got a product
like this motherboard here Asus sent
this over you know it's just as simple
as that is saying here's where I got it
from and then - of course if they do say
that how is their actual reaction to the
product I try to do my absolute very
best to remain neutral and
and critical of the products that are
sent over because they're sent for
review I'm supposed to critique them and
give appropriate feedback for people who
might actually be considering that
product overly glowing reviews that
don't disclose where the product came
from is one thing and then I'd say other
reviewers so you look out for like
texting syndicate as an example I'm
wearing one of their shirts and Logan
has discussed that many times like just
not accepting review samples from
anywhere just to make sure that there's
no possibility of bias or that kind of
thing as far as accepting money for view
that's straight-up illegal I believe
there are there are laws against that if
you you can't like take money say here's
a review of a product and say it's
awesome you have to disclose where it
came from that's why I think when LG
sent out a lot of those big-ass 4k LED
TVs that they did to the end end of last
year they were very specific with all
the reviewers that you have to disclose
where this came from so I think that's
important and I think people are getting
better at it actually saying where stuff
came from and that kind of thing but um
thank you very much for the question and
I hope that gives you an answer here's
another one from Sam he says do you
think AMD Polaris GPUs will match and/or
beat invidious Pascal GPUs and if so
would you be excited to see the
competition that once was between red
and green I would absolutely love to see
more competition between red and green I
would actually like to see more
competition from AMD on the CPU side
against Intel but Nvidia could use a
little kick in the pants as well Radeon
has been kind of hanging strong with
them but you know they they're
definitely not the fastest of the fast
it's really too early to speculate much
but I here's an article from yesterday
that I thought was very interesting on
this topic this is testing DirectX 12
first off there this is from Gordon hung
by the way I'm PC or PC world first off
they're pairing up in Nvidia and a
radeon GPU he's using a 980 and a fury x
and he's not trying to compare a 980 at
fury x but he does run several
benchmarks and these were the sort of
interesting things that I thought that I
noticed when I was reading this article
one would be that the 980 at the 980 and
the fury X did very well together the
two 980 s without SLI did better than
with SLI on so DirectX 12 using the 980
s independently did a better job than
the nine 80s just right out of the gate
and although this article doesn't
necessarily indicate it quite as much a
lot of the performance tests with
DirectX 12 at least early tests have
shown that AMD is doing quite well that
compared with the power consumption
demos that they were showing at CES
makes me really really excited for this
next generation Polaris based GPUs from
AMD or from AMD's Radeon group that said
I think we're probably not going to see
anything really exciting until probably
about June around the Computex time
frame because that's what I'm expecting
to see stuff come out from both sides
but there's going to be tons of
comparisons and all that good stuff but
yes I would say I'm really hoping that
they are and things are looking pretty
good for it so far and thank you very
much for that question
alright next he'll be 50 tasks hey Paul
why don't you answer your comments I
noticed in this video you had 99 plus
replies this is just too many or
laziness and and he also says much love
I love your tech videos as well as
Kyle's and I think actually what he is
referring to here if I can jump back to
my boxers or briefs video actually you
know this is the wrong account that I'm
logged into here but I'm on the other
account which has the same picture it
says 99 Plus up there I don't answer
YouTube inquiries that come in it's just
too much I get too many people asking me
stuff from all directions so Twitter is
really where I focus on as far as actual
replies to people so to anyone who's
ever tried to message me using the
YouTube messaging system and I haven't
replied I'm sorry I'm sorry that I'm not
going to change what I'm doing and then
switch back either okay next edward
green jr asks my current keyboard is
failing i'm looking for a new one were
there any from CES that caught your eye
he's looking for a full layout
mechanical RGB model he wants a screen
theme and all star jeebies aren't green
I was looking at the Razer BlackWidow
chroma stealth but he's not devoted to
that brand there's a lot of options
there's definitely a lot more options
with mechanical RGB keyboards I've tried
a couple from g.skill I thought they
were pretty decent they're still fairly
expensive although they have been
surprised drops on them and the software
still needed a little bit of work
Corsair is definitely the go-to if you
want RGB LED backlit mechanical switches
they sell the most Cherry MX keyboards
out of anyone so and they have a lot of
different options as well so definitely
check out core
Sera's lineup I know coolermaster has
the master keys that they were showing
off at CES and that's supposed to launch
sometime soon I believe so it might keep
an eye out for that one as well that's
going to have I think a bit more minimal
design than some of the Corsair ones and
that kind of thing but I really like
cooler masters take on a lot of the
mechanical keyboards this is a quick
this is a CM storm rapid eye quickfire
rapid eye which is ten keyless which
which is just I don't know they're built
like trucks they do a really good job if
you're not a mechanical key switch
aficionado then black widows switches
are okay for you they use kale switches
if you're used to cherries and you
switch to kales you might not be as
happy if you're used to Cherry's but if
you're starting off with kales you'll
probably be just fine so those would be
my suggestions for you right there okay
moving over to Twitter questions this
one's actually from last week but I
promised him I would reply to it and
this is in the same vein as that AMD
versus Nvidia question I've been trying
to get your in Kyle's opinion on why you
choose Intel processors over AMD for
weeks and I already applied them just a
little bit and it's basically roughly
the same answer
AMD's processors right now are all based
on very old architecture bulldozer and
piledriver they have made a derivative
improvements and enhancements to them
but here's here's where I want to give a
simple answer here because really that's
it's old its old and they need to make
new stuff they haven't made inherently
new stuff in quite some time on a CPU
side but let's put it this way
whenever I get AMD marketing material
from the Radeon side and they're showing
benchmarks with AMD Radeon graphics
cards they use Intel platforms because
they know that will give the best
performance for their graphics card
possible I'm not saying you shouldn't
use AMD for gaming system because we're
gaming systems which don't need a lot of
CPU horsepower or might need less you
can still get by with them just mine and
they're still kind of viable but with
the stuff they have plans coming out
this year it's hard to advocate buying
into that platform right now and yeah I
mean it's straight from AMD themselves
they know like I mean an 8350 doesn't
even have native PCIe gen3 support so
that's kind of missing out a little bit
too anyway I hope that gives you a
little bit more details there's more I
could go into there like
through the company some of the
decision-making that they did in like
2006 to the mid 2010 s where they were
like focusing on different things and
switching between different CEOs and and
having different goals for the company
and that's always hard to like kind of
keep up with yeah anyway that's probably
hopefully enough explanation of that
question next is a question from Dan he
says where other than the US would you
like to live if you could choose um
Canada I would probably say Canada just
because it's easy they speak English I
really like the Pacific Northwest and
that's even North theour than the
Pacific Northwest
I like big mountains I like hiking I
like clean air all that good stuff I've
been I've traveled other places that I
might consider living but um I don't
know the places I've traveled in Asia
I wouldn't mind visiting for longer
periods of time but it's hard to see
myself living there full-time and
there's definitely places in Europe that
I kind of like pictures I could live
there but I've never actually visit I've
only been to like Italy in Europe so
it's hard for me to say yes I'd move
there but yeah it's a candidate is
probably the easiest answer and also
probably might actually happen depending
on how the political situation in the US
proceeds but now I don't wanna get into
politics okay
evil sunbro asks is a full desktop GPU
in a laptop truly practical I have the
980m and it rocks at 1080 um well like
you said for 1080 and 980m is just fine
but laptops are increasing the
resolution you see right laptops that
are like you know 1440 resolution or
even 4k resolution which i think is a
little bit silly just just a little bit
and you do need more GPU horsepower to
do that I think Nvidia kind of did it
more as a statement piece to say like
look how efficient our processors are we
were GPUs are we were able to put one
into a laptop and there's always there's
always somebody who wants more power so
practical maybe a little bit less so
than the mobile processors but I think
it makes sense with the power and the
efficiency that the 980 has for them to
go ahead and do that alright next is
from Mark Chapman who asks what to look
for wouldn't buying secondhand parts so
just I can give a few quick suggestions
from my experience first off you look at
parts that have a longer lifespan so for
me memory is definitely one of those
since memory formats change in a much
longer time scale so and we just
switched to DDR
for but ddr4 should be the standard for
quite some time CPUs I find are very
rarely fails however they can get
outdated so I'm always on the fence
about that CP buying a CPU second handy
is usually a pretty safe bet though
beyond that there's always the go-to
components that have really long
lifespan like a case or maybe a power
supply a mechanical hard drive is
something that I would not buy second
hand because you never know how much use
it's actually been put through and
mechanical hard drives have a limited
lifespan so I definitely not look for
that last thing would be to double check
who you're buying it from like you know
massive eBay resellers that just get
lots of like you know damaged parts and
and you know sort through them and
resell stuff they know what stuff's
worth so you're not going to get as good
of a deal buying from an individual or
somebody who like you know has an old
system and just wants to get rid of it
that's probably where you're going to
get the most bang for your buck buy in
second-hand ok next up is a question
from Zach who says now that's pretty
much done what are your favorite or most
helpful parts of your garage setup and
Zach I'm I'm flattered that you think
I'm almost done but I really do have
quite a bit more work but I'm really
happy with these shelves up here just
the fact that I have some more storage
that I can just like pop some stuff up
there and it's really easily accessible
that's really the main thing for me
though is making things accessible I
want like if I'm sitting here and I'm
like I need this piece to do this thing
and I know I have it I don't have to go
to a big pile and dig through the pile I
want to be able to go to like a nice
little drawer or a shelf or something
where I know stuff is and that's kind of
been the biggest benefit for me so far
it's just being more organized so I can
be more efficient as I move through
making videos every day
next from Angelo's I like this question
how many a well free trials did you use
back in the day and the answer would be
as many as my dad had credit cards which
I think ended up being like 6 or 7 times
I went through the AOL free trial
because if you tried to use the same
credit card after your month expired or
whatever it wouldn't let you redo it but
if you used a different credit card even
if you had like the same IP and
everything it would still let you do it
so yeah I did I think I'm pretty sure I
did five or six AOL free trials using
different credit cards before finally
like my dad or my parents were like I
were just going to pay monthly
subscription fee for AOL
lastly from Ronan
he asks what made you decide to start
YouTube full-time as opposed to keeping
a full-time job and YouTube on the side
that is a good question there's lots of
factors that went into it and I can't
really delve into all of them but I
would say Kyle had something to do with
it because it was his idea first and he
was kind of talking about it and then I
was like yeah maybe I could do that too
second is I really like being
independent and kind of calling my own
shots and being able to just have an
idea for a video and go ahead and make
it I also really like being able to be
more critical about stuff to kind of
like dig into the shadier I'm gonna call
it shadier but just certain things like
I could never have made my Windows 10
for $20 video working at Newegg they
they would not have been happy with me
about that so yeah I like the freedom
and I really like the I mean this isn't
something that made me do it but
something after the fact was just the
amount of feedback I got from people
watching the channel as far as the
content I was making and and and all
that over the past couple years has been
amazing so yeah it was all those
together and then now there's two other
things one would be that my subscriber
rate had gotten up to a pretty it was a
significant enough that I felt if I put
my effort into it full time that I could
make a living off of it and also my wife
has a full-time job and she has health
insurance and she said you know I will
add you to my health insurance and you
can work from home and I'm cool you know
if there's any financial difficulties or
whatever she was okay to help me out
that so that probably more than anything
was my biggest contributing factor to me
saying like yes I can do this and I'm
really really glad that I did so anyway
that's all the questions I have for
today though so guys again leave me more
questions down in the comments section
down below if you want to don't forget
to do all the things that I usually tell
you to do at the end of the video like
check out my store where you can buy
shirts mugs and glasses check out my
Amazon links and click them before you
buy stuff that's always really helpful
if nothing maybe hit the like button if
you enjoyed this video and yeah stay
tuned for Saturday when I've got this
Maximus 8 formula it's going to be a
pretty it's a pretty thorough review I
hope I think you
like it thanks again for watching guys
and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
