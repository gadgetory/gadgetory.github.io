streaming live to YouTube now oh I
forgot to get more beer
oh sorry chef okay Cal's
Kyle's gonna go get more beer well I
start the show we have ice packs today
cuz it's kind of warm here hi everyone
and welcome to awesome hardware this is
a live show we talk about technology
computers computer parts PC gaming
extreme every Tuesday evening at 5:30
p.m. Pacific time extreme the entire
show which usually goes for one to two
hours depending on how its how much we
drink to twitch.tv slash awesome
hardware you may also stream to our
YouTube channels the first half of
today's episode which is number 189 has
already been streamed - Kyle's channel
bit wit that's linked in the video's
description if you want to check it out
now I just get to sit here and drink
beer while you talk yeah rub it in my
face
why don't you I sure will I'm gonna sit
here and drink beer while I talked to
speaking of beer we do drink a beer or
two on the show we feel free to join us
drink responsibly please and if you
don't like the drinking of the beer then
don't watch our show we also use adult
language from time to time so sorry
about that but you know it's always
appropriate and if you don't like that
then don't watch our show - yep many
reasons to not watch this show yeah but
we try to get them out there at the
beginning so people don't waste their
time if you like being told things
upfront so you don't waste your time
then watch our show see these are those
reasons to watch the show as well yeah
if you don't like shameless plugs for
stores that sell our merchandise don't
want your show to watch your show but if
you do then maybe once consider buying
something Paul tyroid dotnet is my store
where you can buy shirts mugs pint
glasses hoodies bottle openers they're
all real nice most recent new design is
this captain thumbscrew shirt which I
still need to get one
it fits me but it's a great shirt it's a
great shirt and everyone really likes it
Paul Cybernet for my store kal store is
bit with tech slash store he also has a
new design in this screw with confident
shirt there it is beautiful it's
glorious we are not doing an after party
today but we will try to give some
shoutouts to people who buy stuff during
the show at the end of my half so thanks
to you guys who do that and support our
channels and our future endeavors and so
on and so forth ok
that said we're gonna get right back
into some technology news wait I have a
thing here there we go
starting with the big news of this week
so like III is going on right now so
there's a lot of gaming news and we
actually talked about a bunch of
different video games and trailers and
stuff I'm Kyle's half of the show so if
you missed that check it out we're gonna
talk more about a little bit of gaming
stuff but also the hardware stuff an AMD
was the one who really came with two big
announcements yesterday they had a live
streamed event and they have finally
revealed some pricing some release dates
for their na'vi based graphics cards we
talked about the CPU side of things on
kylos half of the show we're gonna talk
about that a little bit more in the way
of opinion stuff alehrer on in my my
show so stick around for that but um
here's what we have on the na'vi side
and this article's for pc gamer we have
the Radeon rx 5700 XT seen here being
held up by AMD CEO Lisa Lisa soo it's
gonna cost four hundred and fifty
dollars us it has a two hundred and
twenty-five watt TDP forty compute units
two thousand five hundred and sixty
stream processors eight gigs of Gd dr
six clocked at fourteen Giga transfers
per second 14 gigabits per second as the
transfer speed for 448 gigabytes per
second of total bandwidth they're
pitching it as a 1440p gaming graphics
card and then frequencies are a base
clock of 1605 a boost clock of 1905 and
something that they're calling game
clock which is 1755 megahertz years use
all those
there's all those stats right there if
you're wondering about these clock
speeds down here game clock the one in
the middle is kind of like the lower end
of your expected frequency that you'd be
running at while you're just playing a
normal normal video game right you know
and that will vary depending on the game
and depending on your system and
depending on your cooling and lots of
stuff like that but basically what AMD
told us is while you're actually gaming
what you should be seeing is a frequency
somewhere between your game clock and
the boost clock boost clock is more like
an ideal like if you have really good
cooling and you're keeping everything
nice and chilly in there and you know
you're playing the game that the
graphics card can keep up with I guess
then you should be seeing something
closer to the boost clock but it's it's
a different way it's sort of a newer way
of describing things when I have been
talking about clock speeds for graphics
cards like what NVIDIA has been doing
for quite some time ever since they
started saying like look we don't have a
fixed frequency it changes which is a
good idea yeah I typically talk about
the base clock that they give the max
frequency which would be kind of like
what they're saying it's boost clock
here and then I usually try to give an
average frequency which is my experience
what I see in actual gameplay real-world
results so you know hopefully that plays
out when in testing and the frequencies
that they're giving here are accurate
it's a little confusing because I feel
like the game clock is it almost fits
the description of like what you would
imagine a base clock would be because
like AMD is saying like this is sort of
like they're not like really
guaranteeing it but they're saying the
majority of gamers are can expect to see
at bare minimum this clock speed in
games which in my mind sounds like a
bass clock like this is the bass
expectation but in reality the bass
clock is what bass clock right but then
the bass clock is like if you were
running like super heavy under load like
stress test applications correct I'm
hearing you're right you're saying that
this game clock here to you seems to
indicate that it's more like a bass
clock or that it sounds like have a bass
clock that's called bass clock well it
sounds like bass clock would be the
better suited name
for what the game clock represents I
don't know if I agree with you there but
like so what they said is is if you're
running fur mark or something like that
yeah a power virus type GPU test
synthetic test which puts stress levels
on the GPU that you would never get
anywhere close to it with with any
normal video game right then you will be
running at the base clock because it's
getting hotter because it's under the
most extreme strenuous right environment
or testing scenario this is the lowest
frequency that it should be running at
it short and I think like based on what
they said it'll down clock below this if
it's idle or something like that if
you're just on the desktop if you're not
doing something that's 3d rendered right
um so I like I don't know and maybe they
should have called it a min clock or
something I mean like I think min clock
would be more because if it's gonna be
if if they're saying that the actual
frequency is gonna operate between game
clock and boost clock min and boost
seems kind of like the perfect kind of
end cap you know description of what
those frequencies represent no game
clock just sounds weird okay and I'm a
big nit picky
it's very enough well I mean well we'll
see how this plays out and whether its
nomenclature that catches on or anything
yeah there's also a Radeon rx 5700 which
is the lower end version this one's
gonna be 379 US dollars 380 this one is
a lower TDP as 175 watts so about 50
watts less than the XTS
225 36 computing it units through 2300
for stream processors 8 gigs of GDD are
6 running at the same speed as far as I
as far as I've been told and then lower
clock speeds basically yeah it seems to
be you know you got a slightly cut-down
GPU and then lower clock speeds to hit
that lower TDP and you know about 70
bucks cheaper and is that the is that
the actual what it's gonna look like the
crowd yeah so it's not going to have
that sort of dent in it like the
cheaver no so the the 5700 has this
shroud design which is a lot more
reminiscent of like the Radeon seven
that they launched a few months back
right so I mean that's pretty clean
looking at everything internally from I
believe the blower style cooler they
have is exactly the same so this is just
an aesthetic exterior here's my video
where I have a bit of footage of this
shroud which is for the 5700 XT and it's
got this sort of little dent in the
middle little divot right there and I've
seen various feedback on that from
people who say that it's it looks cool
to other people who are like it's just
squished right there it looks like a
dent it looks like a dent it follows the
contour so if you look internally at the
at the layout of the blower fan and
everything and that's like it's got a
vapor chamber that's over here and these
typically will take the blower fan and
sort of direct the air that's being
pushed so it curves in there so you
don't like you don't need to keep it
open there I think is why they decided
to do that I guess but I don't know I'm
sure it's an aesthetic thing so some
people will love it some people hate it
they just want to make it a little
different I think this is C Steve back
there but yeah just creeping yeah oh
trying to get epic b-roll what is this
Steve's in there just like I'm gonna
measure something here but you know he's
just doing it to sabotage your video
he's clearly look at the look in his eye
right out to get a pause this so he's
got his own look Houston that's a
sadistic Steve right he's got kind of
he's like smiling you can tell he's got
like a joker grin yeah he does look at
how sharp the angle is of his eyebrow
yeah that's like I'm gonna kill someone
angle and I asked somebody who's doing
he wouldn't tell me after that so it's
very gonna measure you measure your body
Palmer's Nexus branded ruler yes but
Steve was there it was good to catch up
with Timothy yeah good peeps other than
that I mean we we have all these specs
we have oh I guess we have these
benchmark charts that AMD put out which
are right here so oh yeah that's the
best now bear in mind when you're
looking at these charts that like
marketing charts they they they've
changed the way the layouts of graphs
pretty frequently so the r-tx 27b here
the Graybar for that is representing 100
percent of the r-tx 20 70s performance
so it might be hitting different frames
per second in each of these games
they're showing here Assassin's Creed
Odyssey battlefield 5 black ops for Far
Cry nude on Metro Exodus and so on and
then they're showing percentage-wise how
much faster or slower the 5700 XT is by
and large it is faster you know slower
and a couple games shadow of the Tomb
Raider and sub 6 it also has the quality
setting that they're using here so
basically what they're saying is that
the 850 200 XT in their testing is
faster than the RT X 2070 in this set of
games by and large and they threw in a
couple games where it was slower just to
show that they're being fair mm-hmm we
also have this chart which is the 5700
compared to the RT X 2060 similar layout
here 100% performance for the 2060 and
then plus percentage points for how much
faster they say that the d700 is yeah so
you know what what you see here and in
these charts is CN notes are X 366 so
the full deck for these which this is
something that came to mind when I was
doing my video yesterday the full deck
for these is available to press so we
can download it from like a shared
source that AMD shares with press yeah
and that at the very end has a bunch of
footnotes that says like oh you know
these tested with this test introduced
configuration or whatever like that yeah
I feel like a lot of these get shared
with people and they can't necessarily
reference that information right and I'm
bringing this up with the full knowledge
that I don't have that information that
I pulled up to share with you guys right
now anyway yeah I don't either so point
being you know it's always grain of salt
you never know how accurate these
benchmarks are going to be when they
come directly from the manufacturer and
whether or not they sort of massage
something or tried to slip something in
one way or another yeah this is
marketing at the end of the day this is
marketing but then there's also some
other things you have to consider let's
take let's let's assume this is a cure
and the performance numbers are there
and that d50 750 700 XD are faster than
what AMD is pitching them against the
r-tx 2060 and 2070 you also have to keep
in mind that the r-tx 2016 2070 are six
and ten months old at this point they've
been out for a bit
they are also built on 12 nanometer
technology as opposed to the seven
nanometer that na'vi is based on right
and they have lower T DPS so Navi has a
higher TDP despite being on 7 nanometre
versus 12 nanometer right 2060 RT x 2060
is 160 watt TDP 2070 is 175 watt TDP so
all this is to say when I got all the
news about like the Rison 3000 stuff and
the Navi stuff on the Navi side I'm glad
this is a this is here this is using our
DNA which is a new completely new GPU
architecture so it is a successor to GCN
it's not some REE you know it's not a
rehash of GC n or anything like that
like the Radeon 7 was so you know we're
seeing some potential here but you don't
have tensor cores you don't have
Hardware ray-tracing support which might
not be important to you at all right but
it is something that you get with the RT
X stuff yeah it's a beat right here that
you're not getting with that so mm-hmm
all this is stuff that you know you
should keep in mind if you're
considering a GPU purchase and whatnot
so I think these are going to be
competitive in the mid-range I don't
know if the prices that they came out
with or like sticking it to Nvidia quite
as much as a different I saw a lot of
people say you know 50 bucks off of both
of these and be like wow these are yeah
you know super definitely gonna buy
these over the Nvidia options right at
450 bucks
if you're comparing the Radeon 5700 XT
to supposedly the $500
RTX 2070 you know the RT X 2070 is 450
bucks these days - they're available and
they do dip down below and videos MSRP
that they first
that they first pitched last night Rick
they were all at 500 on new egg oh
really
yeah I couldn't find one for less than
call me a lie for 95 call me Larry I
didn't check Amazon so maybe on Amazon
they're cheaper check this right now cuz
Kyle's Kyle's trying to call me by my
and main mo okay we've got we've got a
four for 79 we've got a 479 option here
on our 79 EVGA it's a pretty standard
one how do you even buy the twenty
series oh there it is 479 is the
cheapest I'm seeing for RTX fly it was
also a blower style em aside one that's
probably not as good
well cording to the article they dip
down to 450 but maybe you gotta wait for
final yeah I was 475 Wow oh it's okay
yeah all right I was looking at new but
but I definitely thought that the I
thought that the r-tx armed sorry the
5,700 xt pricing was a bit more
competitive than the non xt because you
can find r-tx 2060s for 350 bucks
- undercuts the MSRP on the 5700 by
about $20 and i think in that case AMD
is hoping you'll look at the memory
allocation yeah eight gigs versus six
gigs and I mean if you're looking at
1440 game gameplay there's an argument
to be made you know that that's that
might be a selling point for yeah so so
they go yeah and I apologize for lying
to everyone about the 430ex 27 wasn't
your fault I blame wait who wrote this
PC world article Paul Lilly damn it Paul
go damn it Paul
bringing shame oh wait no no never mind
it wasn't following we can't even blame
the right person it was Jared Jared
goddamn it
he was there at the blame Jared okay
speaking of Paul Lilly let's move on to
the next thing to talk about Intel so so
we already talked on Kyle's half about
the raisin 3000 series stuff we're gonna
do some opinion questions in just a
minute
intel has come out they came out a day
before AMD's events and they said come
beat us in real world gaming AMD yeah
shots fired and stuff which is
interesting because until this is a
different sort of tack than intel has
taken in the past and tell in the past
you asked him about AMD when it comes to
competition and and their their response
was more likely going to be whoo yeah
and basically not even acknowledge the
existence or viability of AMD at all
which in my opinion if you're trying to
throw shade is a better way to go that's
I mean if you're trying to throw shit I
think I don't think you should bother
throwing shade at all right you should
you should stand on the you know the
merits of the product that you're
putting out and be like look you guys
not performance and you'd be enough yeah
but if you're gonna throw shade I feel
like that's a little bit more classy way
of doing it but you know they decided to
do this this time around which was to
say so you're going to hear a lot about
gaming CPUs this week I haven't heard
this day may or may not come from
certain three-letter acronyms hmm I love
how the different competitors refer to
each other I know they usually say our
competitor right and then every once
awhile they accidentally say them by
name and it's like Voldemort we said the
name that said here's what I want to
challenge you I want to challenge you to
challenge them if they want this crown
come beat us in real world's gaming real
world gaming should be the defining
criteria that we use to assess the
world's best gaming CPU this is from
John Carvel who's Intel's VP of
Marketing it was an interview with PC
games n he said I challenge you to
challenge anyone that wants to compete
for this ground to come meet us in real
worlds gaming that's the measure that
we're going to stand by well John once
we get rising 3,000 C serious CPUs that
is exactly what we will do it's not 100%
about just real world gaming though
anymore is it
because well that's just one cell to
like that's been my sort of statement
for the past couple years now since
risin has been a viable option has been
like look if you all you ever gonna do
is game and he never planned a stream or
encode video or do anything that's like
CPU heavy lifting then go for Intel
because you're gonna get better
performance out of the graphics card
that you choose to pair it with across
all scenarios but granted that's mostly
at the lower ends 1080 resolution where
you're more CPU limited than GPU limited
but the point still stands that that
might be a better overall experience for
you if the case is the gaming
performance is pretty much equivalent
whether you're dealing with Intel or AMD
then it drops down to the next most
important thing on your list when it
comes to what you want your CPU to do if
it if both the CPUs are gonna game just
fine or not discern not in a discernibly
difference manner to one another then
after that you'd be like alright how
does the video transcoding go with one
versus the other what am i buying when
it comes to core on thread counts if the
single at the single core single thread
performance is roughly equivalent then
you can look directly at the cores and
threads and be like well I'm getting
more cores and more threads with the CPU
versus the CPU for less money or for the
equivalent amount of money and then you
have to make a decision based on that so
it's just interesting for Intel to come
out and say this for one simply because
it's not something that you've heard
typically from their marketing
department in the past and I mean I'm
very curious to see especially given the
fact that of all of the benchmark
information that that AMD shared in the
past day or two they came out and said
look all of these numbers that we that
we gathered we're done without the most
recent Windows 10 updates that improve
the Intel the Windows 10 scheduler to
prioritize a single CCX on Rison CPUs
and I think
thread Ripper as well which which does
amazing things for gaming because that
because enter CCX latency is what causes
the latency that slows down gaming
performance in certain scenarios so it
doesn't have that intel has shown to be
susceptible to a significant number of
security exploits that have come out
recently and the patches for those can
often drag down their performance and be
also said that they Intel benchmarks
they ran did not have those updates for
security mitigations for stuff like
spectre so like what's I don't know
what's get what's gonna happen when we
do what John is asking us to do here and
test with these with this update it's
not what the software updates in place
and is he going to be eating his words
if the if it turns out the gaming
performance is equal because that's all
they're really looking for if your
gaming performance is equal then why
would you buy an Intel CPU yeah
when you can get like all the other
areas of performance you can get much
more for your money with AMD right and
we're talking about a platform that AMD
has been supporting for three plus years
now exact that they've come out with now
three generations of processors that
still work on there's a lot of people
who may be invested in 300 series
motherboards even 400 series who are
very happy about the fact that hey these
news processors I can just buy one and
drop it into my existing system exactly
yeah so I think AMD has very
intentionally targeted a lot of the
areas that Intel has not been
consumer-friendly
right and they've not been consumer
friendly by holding back hyper threading
except to the highest end CP CP used
they've not been consumer friendly by
not maintaining the same platform even
going with the same socket 1151 like oh
no 300 some other boards you need you
need the new motherboard for this stuff
overclocking some overclocking unlocks
for overclocking support they're hitting
them on all these points and up to until
now Intel has been able to say well we
still have the high that we still have
the best performing processors we still
the best performing processors for
gaming for single core performance and
if that goes away like what what doesn't
they'll have to make an argument for got
no
cards right so and and even if they are
better like at some point people gonna
be like alright if it's if if AMD is
just close enough if they're like within
five maybe 10% of the performance that's
almost going to be negligible in
real-world experience people are still I
feel like the people who do their
research before buying are still gonna
see the value in the AMD platform it's
like okay you were quite ahead you are
you are a long a long ways ahead of AMD
in terms of gaming performance and now
maybe you're not you're still number one
but AMD is now closed the gap so much to
the point where all the other benefits
of the platform outweigh that 5% benefit
that Intel offers you don't mean it's
like I in my book they don't even aim he
doesn't even have to match Intel at this
point they have so much else riding for
them that they could just get within
pretty close and that'd be good enough
for me to say I'm switching over you
know what I mean and all that said as as
enthusiastic as I am about what AMD has
been doing recently all Intel really
needs to do at this point once AMD comes
out with whatever they come out with is
price cuts that's not uncommon you know
that happens pretty regularly yeah when
new products come out price cuts are
done to slightly older products to make
them more competitive with the newer
products Intel doesn't usually do that
though right but you see like even
Nvidia who you could argue is kind of up
there with Intel when it comes to their
own opinion of their own products which
which you could argue is valid in
everything but I don't together.that but
even NVIDIA comes up with price cuts and
they said I carry at the base price of
the whatever GPU is then I can't think
of an example alright at the top of my
head but point being if Intel were to
come out and be like alright we
recognized this new competition in the
marketplace
well done AMD here's a round of price
cuts that now make sure to make our
products sit in different families and
different categories if they were to do
that then you'd be okay its bits we're
fight we're back in this but right until
that happens I'm gonna be looking at the
core and thread counts of what's
available for eyes the 3000 series and
being like look anyone who's asking me
what to buy
gonna get more ya for your money with
this and that's so true about nvidia and
intel like the opinion they have of
their own products like to do a to do a
like a family wide price cut is to
swallow your pride in a lot of ways for
a company right it's basically saying
that our products are not worth as much
as we initially said they were and so I
feel like with Intel being the champ in
the CPU space for so long for them to
sort of eat their words in that sense is
I don't know I feel like that their ego
might be too big still that they haven't
been taken down enough rungs to actually
price drop and so maybe they're still
relying on people just seeing Intel as a
household brand and who haven't even
heard of Rison you know and they still
have enough cash flow coming in in other
areas to to stay profitable
it'll be interesting to see how how much
pride they swallow you know with this
launch if they actually do price and
just to just to clarify and bring the
stuff down to back down to earth as real
vision gaming is pointing out these
parts are not out yet we are doing
somewhat of forward-looking here yeah we
have not verified all the smartnumbers
that AMD has come out with so all of the
stuff we're saying right now about the
validity of AMD's products might go out
the window if it turns out once we get
the parts and test them that you know
Andy's numbers were false or misleading
or whatever then that or that there's
some secret hidden thing that is causing
the performance to be what it is that
could be the case I'm not expecting that
but as always is as you guys should
always do wait for those independent
reviews for now though you know we're
looking we're looking at what is
hopefully going to be a launch that
gives a lot of people some pretty good
options for choosing some really high
end high quark out CPUs on a mainstream
platform yeah so cool excited about that
all right one more story to go over here
real quick before we do
a little bit of QA and stuff no wait
but before that we were being brought my
wife has brought us cookies I want you
to take a bite did you guys make these
yeah I mean I made them so take a bite
and see if you can tell me what the
secret ingredient is oh there's a secret
there's a secret ingredient okay do you
you think about that while I talk about
this I know what my news story which is
the xbox game past PC which is actually
a pretty cool thing from Microsoft when
it comes to Xbox like Xbox gaming if
you're a PC gamer doesn't always get you
very excited but they have this thing
called Xbox game pass for PC users who
are using Windows 10 it's a
subscription-based service right now you
can sign it for five bucks a month but I
think that's a temporary discount yeah
if you signed up yesterday it was $1.00
for the first month but I'm five bucks a
month it is eventually going to go up to
a flat $10 monthly fee but you install a
loader or you install sort of like a
steam at kind of client yeah and saw
client app on your Windows 10 computer
and then you can access a hundred like
100 plus games hmm this is supposedly
going to be a rotating library of games
so what I'm kind of curious about is
what happens like if the library rotates
in a game that you're playing suddenly
isn't available anymore or anything like
that hopefully they have solutions for
that especially if it's a longer game
that takes a lot of time and you have a
save and you want to keep playing it or
maybe they just keep adding games I
don't know but point being for now this
is a list of games it's going to be
available so if you played Xbox games
and you're nostalgic and you want to
play them again or if there are Xbox
games that you never played for instance
the halo series which you can see
Spartan assault Spartans strike
definitive edition and Halo Wars two
standard edition all going to be
available out of the gate we also some
Gears of War you know Xbox one games or
they some of them it's a mix
like um Metro Exodus in here so some of
them are current Xbox games some of them
some of them are older okay
Xbox games from older generations of
Xbox but yeah the Halo games being in
there is pretty exciting link is links
to all the stories I'm talking about
today as are down in the description if
you guys want to go in and take a look
at this and check it out for yourself
but you know 10 bucks a month doesn't
seem that bad no for a set of games
especially 5 bucks a month right now but
I mean you know even for 10 bucks a
month about to see if they keep putting
good games in there if they start just
filling it with filler crappy games or
something my question when I saw this
was what happens if there's a game that
you're playing and they swap it out in
the middle of your your gameplay yes oh
my god can you can you request like I
want to keep playing this game I'm like
I'm almost there like don't switch it on
me doesn't mean at the end of the day
you're paying for a subscription you're
not technically paying for the games
themselves so you don't technically own
any of these games you're owning access
to a rotating list of games that can
potentially change without you knowing
it'll be interesting to see how they
handle that and if that's going to be an
issue for members and stuff but these
are really good
um secret ingredient I'm not sure but
I'll take a wild guess
Hey maple syrup no shit
avocado avocado for the creaminess Wow
um I would have never guessed that cuz I
don't really not really taste any
avocado hey I don't taste it very much I
like avocado but hmm what does it do
just makes it well extra the texture
thing so my wife's friend brought us
cookies mm-hmm that were avocado
chocolate chip cookies okay and they're
really good so we decided to make them
ourselves yeah
basically the avocado were places like
half of the butter that you would
normally use really yeah no way so so
there it is so you still use partial
butter and partial yeah there's still
some butter um but then you use like a
half a cup of avocado in there what if
you just went no there's no THC in there
no that's my first guess music secret
ingredient like herb those are the
brownies bodacious oh yeah that's good
okay so yeah ooh
now you taste avocado that old there's
like a weird aftertaste
that's definitely avocado whoa that's
weird
there you go I'm a changed man I will
never be the same
avocado chocolate chip is Wow good stuff
well thank you alright moving on to a TA
okay so we're gonna ask you guys some
questions we will briefly discuss some
of the answers well we'll see what you
guys have to say these are straw polls
so they'll be linked in chat and please
go ahead and vote on them so that we can
get your responses three questions to
ask you guys just to start again so I
try to try to test the waters see what
you guys are thinking like we've we've
expressed a decent amount of our
opinions when it comes to a lot of this
stuff from the past week or two but we
want to know what you guys think so
that's why we have this segment ask the
audience so talking about the CPU side
of things and the current battle between
AMD and Intel
basically the battle is AMD has risin
Zen to stuff they're launching in about
a month
Intel is promising some ten nanometer
stuff at the end of the year or even
twenty twenty so we're still sort of
waiting on Intel's response if and what
it's going to be to the AMD launches but
are you guys excited for AMD I tried did
make these like the AMD side team team
AMD at the top and team Intel at the
bottom and then sort of some in-between
answers as well but you got AMD
dominating you got Intel still
dominating at the bottom you got here
which is basically that Intel is going
to give up some ground but we're gonna
say I tried to make this seem like more
even or you know AMD's maybe gonna get a
little bit back but it's all still gonna
be on top
oh no they went the Windows updates it
threatened me with earlier God so feel
free to vote on this one let me know
what you think thank yourself for
linking this drop lunch at we're going
to talk about the other straw polls
first before we go over the responses
III week we mainly talked about a lot of
this stuff on Cal's half of the show but
um it's been a ton of e3 announcements
whether it's just people freaking out
about Keanu Reeves or what else I feel
like it's supposed to be on everything
that begins and ends with Keanu which is
as it should be
he's a good person
it's but I'm just trying to get some
feedback on the e3 stuff okay
awesome just okay it sucks or you're
completely unaware and finally what day
is it
what mr. good adoption what - that's a
straw poll and finally I want to know
your purchasing decisions or intentions
when it comes to these AMD launches
because we've both of them rising 3000
series and the Radeon rx 5700 series or
the release of to 5700 cards XT and non
XT are all launching on the same day
July seventh 7/7 which I can't blame
them for going for 7 nanometre 7 7
sounds good marketing ploy mmm I can
stand behind it so for these agai by
both you're gonna buy just the CPU just
the GPUs so for this edition of ask the
audience are we trying to argue our own
what we own personally think that was
that was not a sentence are we trying to
argue what we personally feel or are we
trying to guess what the audience is
going to pick we are trying to guess
what the audience okay we can give our
own opinions - sure
factor into the yes argument okay all
right but yeah I'm ready back to kick
your ass
phase 1 what do you think ah battle oh
he meant L team AMD somewhere in the
middle I'm gonna say that
I'm gonna say the first one and easin
become the market leader leave Intel in
the dust 7n Demeter team AMD for the win
I think the second option is probably
true but not within the time frame most
people think it is
I think Intel is such a big corporate
ship that takes so long to turn for any
my new change of anything of the way
that they've been doing things for a
decade plus is going to take years for
them to change even a little aspect of
that because right now there's probably
a small ragtag team rogue team at Intel
who knows all these things and knows
that what they need to change in order
to stay competitive but it's fucking
Intel they're a massive whale it's gonna
take that little ragtag team years until
they finally get the support they need
to actually put these things into place
and I think eventually maybe two years
down the line they might start to steer
that ship in the right direction but for
now this is AMD's time to shine okay
sure I feel like you you argued most of
what I was gonna say o cuz I'm gonna go
with the second option here but I think
you make a good point which is that into
if Intel does respond it's probably not
going to be right off the bat they're
probably not gonna announce price breaks
I mean who knows maybe maybe they might
but I seriously doubt it
I don't think Intel's gonna be
announcing price breaks on July 7th or
or even right around that timeframe I
think what I will come down to for Intel
is sales numbers they're gonna have to
look at what's selling right and how
much of an impact
AMD's new products are having on the
sales of their existing products and if
it's significant enough if it's if
they're hurting bad enough then they'll
be like right we need to do something I
don't know how much like discussion like
the type we're having right now or
people having in chat applies to that or
whatever but I would I would bet the
option to hear
they're gonna lose some grounds to AMD I
don't know if AMD is gonna like the big
question for me it's like is AMD gonna
claw their way back up to like 40 50
percent are they gonna go over 50
percent market share yeah I mean and
that depends on what you're talking
about whether you're talking about home
use or enterprise and server side of it
whatever a lot of the stats you see will
you know you have to look carefully at
what they're including there but I would
be curious for at least the home market
if if AMD is able to get back closer to
50 percent or even over after some time
goes by but I think it will largely
depend on what Intel has to say but
let's see what the results are we've
given long enough hey that's it yeah I
win well I mean I I I sided with that
point you did to a degree I feel like
you made the argument for that point you
know you're choosing the yeah covered my
bases there but I mean top two answers
here yeah getting 75 85 percent of the
vote right that's a lot I mean it seems
like at least from our audience
a lot of people are have some high
expectations for these AMD products yeah
and hopefully I have I mean I hope they
deliver because I think that'll be good
for the consumers yeah definitely only
1% only 8 votes for that for the team
Intel I mean honestly if you're taking
that stance right now it means you're it
means you're very much yeah at this
point right but let's let's move on III
week how's it been going for people oh
yeah alright you know Frank I think
people think it's awesome
I'm gonna go further it's awesome option
here and that people are very excited
and this is probably largely based on my
like Twitter feed and stuff because I've
been seeing lots of people talk about it
flip side to that is that I follow a lot
of people who are like in the industry
and stuff so there's a lot of people who
are there at the event so what else are
they gonna be tweeting and
- was about but like man that Keanu
Reeves think I could I so I just explode
much hype all over like if you looked at
reddit it was like every other thread it
was kind of crazy there he's a good mean
but yeah I feel like there have been
some pretty some pretty big
announcements already so far so so yeah
I think people are probably pretty
excited about the announcements that
have been made and stuff I'll tell you
why you're wrong Paul I think you know
people are just a little bit on the meth
side of things when it comes to e3 this
year I think that III has exhausted all
of their other good cards all of their
secret weapons are already out laid out
on the table and it's all downhill from
here
nothing else is gonna be very
interesting I think people were looking
forward to Xbox project scarlet being
released later this year and now they're
finding out it's being pushed to year
back
I think the titles that were showing off
this year look very compelling but most
of the content and material has been in
the form of cinematic trailers where
we're not really seeing any real
gameplay any raw gameplay which is
really at the core of of whether or not
these titles are gonna succeed or not so
yeah it's a very valid completely it's
very interesting it's very very easy to
WoW a crowd with the trailer with it
with the cinematic trailer you know but
the actual mechanics of the game will
will inevitably be what defines how well
this e3 did okay so you're going for I'm
gonna do a second second option there
just okay yeah alright let's see what
you guys have to say alright Cal win Wow
okay I was I was gonna pick your your
option first that's in the middle some
middle middle of the road but hey I mean
that's still a third of people who were
very very stoked excited yeah the what's
III getting more of a vote than the e3
sucks
kind of splitting your votes there those
people don't know it years yeah that's
good to know
all right last question for asking the
audience 3950 X and or Radeon rx 5700 XT
let's make this quick
yep just pick and go yes both calluses
yes both I'm gonna choose upgrading but
to one of the lower models mm-hmm okay
results hey I win good call
Wow no thanks 404 over over a quarter of
the you picked the number one boat I
picked the last boat you did make it
quick as I kept that one alright hey
fair enough but lots of people planning
to upgrade yeah one of the lower models
that's that's a pretty blanket statement
anyway so whether you're talking about
upgrading the GPU or the CV yeah sure
but cool all right
absent thanks for your feedback on those
guys and yeah it's always interesting to
ya get the feedback from the ask the
audience segment before we go we're
gonna answer some questions at a mass
and chat and give some shout outs we
usually do this during an after party
but we're trying to keep things slightly
short today so the cow can drive home
before he falls asleep from jet lag and
we will be bringing back the after party
probably starting next week but yeah
I'll depend of Calvary you're gonna
rebuild the game the streaming system
yes okay that's in the works it's good
it's important okay so first off bazinga
X $10 thank you very much sir
by the way these are super chat
donations people who donated Paul and I
why did you kill Lyle hashtag we want
Lyle Lyle died I died I killed him
because a yesterday's stream that I did
I said if anything because everyone was
like talking about while and chat and I
was feeling very jealous and I had a
fleeting moment of yeah human human
jealousy and I said if anyone mentions
I'll one more time in chat I'm gonna
kill him and right after I said that
about 500 people commented lie on chat
so they clearly wanted a dead it was
your doing
people you killed him at the other day
so can you blame Kyle think I cut the
stream momentarily so I could sneak off
kill Kyle or while really quick well how
do I make that confusion how'd you do it
that will all be revealed in time okay
so I probably shouldn't just admit that
on the stream because you know that yeah
police investigation is still the
details that goes against me so yeah and
zix's whilewhile has been known as
handsome Lyle has been learning a an
ancient Chinese resurrection technique
however though that could potentially
bring him back at any time with Chinese
some say it's some some speculate that
he might he might be of the Asian I know
there's a lot more hands up there have
been trying to pinpoint that I was just
for you guys I was trying to get that
nailed down but no yeah I mean he it was
he's always very wily with those details
about Lyles history and everything
indeed well thank you for your concern
such a dark past Delta we have $5 thank
you sir do you think X 470 prices will
fall after 7 7 June 7th or should I or
July 7th or should I just give an X 470
board now if there's an appeal you only
be a gaming build um that is an
interesting question like think prices
will drop that much uh yeah I don't
think prices will drop that much either
again just because of how AMD is
positioning the X 570 I think they're
gonna start out kind of in the more
premium area so I mean you might see
some of the higher-end x4 70s go on sale
if they're trying to clear out inventory
of those because they feel like the x5
70s are a better option but honestly if
you're just building a gaming rig be 450
like you don't need you don't need x4 70
there's there's hundred two hundred and
twenty dollar B 450 boards
there's Asus be 450 dash F gaming
there's the MSI be 450 tomahawk that are
really solid boards that do everything
that you need them to do they don't have
some of the higher-end features when it
comes to like surface mounted stuff and
whatever but like they work just fine
and yeah
by and large you don't need the the
higher end stuff so that's where I would
point you does he get X once again $10
again thanks bazinga Kyle the bots are
the ghosts of wile getting his revenge
oh yeah I considered that I thought
maybe he was uh you know attacking me
from the grave and Lyle's like really
into porn
oh yeah he's he's a porn addict
constantly he taught me how to build a
raid 1 array because he has one for his
porn
he just has like 30 30 drives actually
it's it's raid 10 he raid tens all of
his porn drives
it's just I've inherited them they need
to make a raid 69 that'd be great
69 69 never be cific raid configurations
they're storing more word stories porn
and how would that work like the rate
the rate array is also prone like it's
also dn't well like the hard drives in
the array would have like neon like like
got a neon light lighting and stuff
around them would be clear strip club or
CD raptors with the clear so you can you
can see everything you can just see
everything but yeah they all connect
with the universal stripper pole this
plugs into each of them yeah they're all
sure Ricky we keep expanding oh they're
all bodily fluid resistant alright um
thank you very much bazinga once again
let's go with Daniel Daniel uh $4.99 you
rock no you rock thank you very much
Daniel no you're breathtaking
yeah pop Shepard five dollars hope
you're all doing well when I did my
first paid film geek Oh some people just
wanted me to film a 60th college reunion
and edit the whole video to DVD alright
that's cool and glad you told us what
the film gig was otherwise you would
have left it to our imagination and and
the only who would have imagined we have
little data to speculate on yeah what
what that could have been but King but
Congrats pup yeah it was very wholesome
and family friendly and safe for work
Thank you very
you put that put that money to good use
yeah absolutely
Thanks Dinka X once again this is
propulse after 20 bucks 20 bucks how's
the baby doing she's great
uh yeah she's super cute she's Kyle Kyle
said hi to her earlier she's getting
honored every day yeah she's she's very
cute
you know getting getting much more
accustomed to the sort of messed up
sleep schedule getting waked up from
time woken up from time to time
my wife is an absolute Saint because she
knew that the sleep thing was messing me
up and sort of affecting my ability to
come out and like make videos it's like
if I if my brains not working and I want
to sit down and talk on a camera like
there's no it's very difficult so she
has been like not waking me up more like
if the baby just needs a quick diaper
change or something like that so that's
been really helpful for to me nice for
me too so I'll be sure to pass that
information down to heaven yeah tell her
tell her tell her look I don't want to
wake up at night all right you take care
of it and I will she wants to shoot the
videos that's fine with me too yeah
change all the diapers oh yeah she's
doing great and yeah I mean they're
there been some times where I felt like
super drained and tired and just say oh
my gosh how am I gonna get through this
but by-and-large I'm feeling much much
better when it comes to that and yeah
yeah she's incredibly cute yeah I can
keep talking about their baby so it's
been all right thank you did you find
okay 499 ah I missed you go we miss you
too oh it's quite a reaction good to be
back tickle take a little break and then
come back to it
Thank You mr. cool thank you $5.00 so
with X 570 PCI Jen 4 with rice and 3
will Donati cards perform better than
over PCI 3 is it enough to matter that
is interesting a very good question a
question I have as well
we're not going to know for sure until
the cards come out and people do come
comparisons I guarantee there's going to
be people who over on benchmarks
comparing Gen 3 to Gen 4 with Navi cards
pretty quick my guess would be something
similar to comparing PCI Express Gen 2
to Gen
back when the cards were kind of on the
cusp of of that changeover which is that
the faster or like Gen 4 is gonna give
you like a half a percentage to it maybe
one and a half percent yes nothing to
improvement so yeah little bit faster
maybe a few extra frames storage is what
you're looking at but yeah storage I
think I actually I was gonna bring this
up earlier but when you when you look at
the rise in 3000 series stuff coming out
that's mainstream and the existing
thread Ripper stuff and people like what
good is thread refer now thread Ripper
is really all about I oh yeah you have
tons more i/o and PCI Express Lanes but
now you're gonna have rise in 3000
series that has Gen 4 right fewer PCI
Express Lanes but faster yeah so for
those really fast nvme SSDs are gonna be
coming out you know that's the only
platform that's gonna work until
threader 4 3 comes if if and when that
we have no idea when that's gonna happen
if if it's in the works or if it's
coming soon or anything could easily
argue that X 570 is going to be a better
workstation platform than X 399
depending on your use case depending on
your use depending on your use case
never yeah and and I and I can see some
people building like some video editing
rigs because you have a decent amount of
iodine
yeah for a graphics card you can use
eight more lanes for like an add-on PCI
Express card with some nvme SSDs and
there you've got four lanes dedicated to
an nvme SSD which is one of my favorite
things they did with the PCI Express
layout on existing Rison as well as
next-gen Rison
yeah so you can still get a pretty
decent storage array configuration on
there it's just you're not gonna be able
to do something like what I have set up
in Riptide right now which is like I
have three different raids you have
three different rains raid 0 array is on
that system plus about plus 4 other
drives connected yeah so your master
yeah they're like the you can't get that
type of thing on their show multiple
drives and so
I hope that answers your question yeah I
think so did your hog gaming PC 999 hi
Paul I have a Norris ROG x47 TF gaming
motherboard in our 727 our backs does
Asus call XMP something else in the BIOS
I don't see it
and if 32 gigs 8 by 4 32 hundred
megahertz Chiefs kilt right into your GB
RAM it's only stable at 20 800 megahertz
help oh all right well g.skill tried NCR
gb there's a couple different variants
of the 3200 speed one is the ones that
definitely use the B die memory that
have universally worked for me I think
that's the only kit that they've sent me
though that said Asus calls it do CP
it's like direct overclocking profile or
something I don't like it I hate that
they've changed the name for that one of
the other things for rising 3000 series
that AMD said they did was they worked
with the motherboard manufacturers to
unify the nomenclature for all of those
things in the BIOS when it comes to
overclocking yeah which I'm really
hoping takes because it can get really
confusing if you're going from one
manufacturer to another or if you have
something that works really well one and
you want to kind of duplicate it on the
other so yeah do CP is what that is
and usually they have like do CP and
then there's like a few OC modes that
they have in it there so so try that out
and it should work alternatively you can
just go in and manually set the
frequency to 3200 and then you can also
go in and manually set the timings
yourself to the what the kit has listed
and you might have success that way but
try those DLC P profiles hopefully
that'll work for you weird Steven hill
ok we have a lot of door donations to go
so yeah do these a little bit more
quickly and everyone stop donating to
Steven hill $10 going for a full custom
water loop in July for shit's Diggs I
know it makes no sense hope you guys are
doing all right hey you know what if
you're gonna build a custom motor pool
loop July is a perfect time of the year
to do it
if the things are gonna be heating up
when you could really benefit maybe from
an extra few degrees of cooling
potential and it's it's a fun experience
if you've never done it before and if
you have then you just get to practice
your your
if you're going hardline and you can
make a badass system that you can take
an extra layer of pride in that you did
it yourself because there's quite a bit
more thought process and effort that's
required for a custom blue PC but good
luck good luck Steven I hope it I hope
it turns out well be sure to tweet us
the finish result I'd love to see it in
action
me too we got something there oh I was
gonna do mail time today but I think
there's a couple of people who said they
recently sent stuff to my peel box but I
don't think they've arrived yet so I'll
try to do it again next week
this is from John and his partner and
they are our both of our merch people
and they're awesome and we love them up
we love them so much
hey Paul congratulations - and Diana
daughters rule I have to myself
thanks thank you very much John this is
what he sent that's off that it's a
giggles isn't that funny how they
actually said I just I'm doing it for
shits in yeah he specifically said shits
and giggles like you do that Wow beer
see that's great this is what I was
really hoping for look at the thumbscrew
hey oh that's awesome
we have a thumbscrew logo onesie that's
awesome for baby Hana beautiful awesome
and finally we go seeing the same thing
in pink badass a hot pink - right there
that's like a hotline as a hotline you
in there thank you John I don't know if
you watch her in there but thanks dear
inch she'll be really yeah we're gonna
dress her up in these big pictures okay
all right well m6 6.35 British pounds
well GP do you speculate cyberpunk will
need for 1080p would it be more than a
10-6 gtx 1060 or 1070 bar r-tx you guys
are awesome well done
out of words really hard to say yeah at
this point I don't even know what gaming
engine it's using or anything although
that information might be out there I
just don't know but 1060 1070 is a very
good card both both are very good cards
especially for 1080 so I would guess
you're probably okay if that's what
you're working with right now I might
have to lower the settings here and
there but yeah but yeah 1080 1080 I
think I think you're fun at those
depends on your standards for visual
quality yeah different filters and stuff
$45 orders hi hi Paul McHale trying to
decide on putting together a build
either going with a threaded 429 50 X or
getting a 39 50 X which one wow that's
that's a tough call right now yeah well
I use yeah I would say wait a month if
you can if it's not urgent to see the
reviews with the 3950 X because you're
gonna see performance numbers not just
against Intel but also comparing them to
thread Ripper numbers and then at that
point I think there's I would I would
kattiline x is a 3950 X if you don't
need all the i/o that thread Ripper
gives you if you don't need the the quad
channel memory and everything and
storage yeah and if you if you want to
take advantage of fast storage because
you're probably gonna be able to get
your overall system set up when it comes
to the cost of the motherboard and CPU
for a good amount cheaper at least a
couple hundred bucks probably definitely
then a 29 50 X and an X 399 motherboard
because the X 399 motherboards tend to
be very expensive yeah a good example of
like 40 DB Chow DB Chow $20 finally
graduated with an associate's degree in
general biology from 95 Community
College congratulations that's Stevie
got accepted to a CSU nearby double
Congrats been subscribed for the longest
time here's to the next one million
subscribers free both glorious thanks
David thanks David a scratch dude Andrew
Hendrix five Canadians best way to use
an X 470 board with Verizon 3000 CPU if
you don't have an AMD
CPU what we do use the next five for
seventy board with fries and three
thousand if you don't I'm not sure if I
understand the question you have to have
an AMD CPU I don't understand your
question either Andrew I'm sorry
maybe if you don't have a rise in second
gen CPU like what yeah but then it's
like the the closest the closest thing i
can i can assume based on how the
question is phrased is easy he's asking
if it's okay to use a three thousand so
you to put a 3000 series cpu in x47
board the next 470 motherboard i see so
he's maybe building a further system for
his first time considering saving some
money on the next 470 board but also
getting horizon 3000 series cpu yeah can
you still take advantage fully of that
chip is he gonna lose anything honestly
AMD's kept it pretty backwards and
forwards compatible the only thing
you'll be definitely missing out on at
least for now is PCIe gen 4 yeah which
shouldn't be a problem for most gamers
if you're just gaming and stuff I think
you're pretty good there it's actually
something that I would suggest to some
of my friends and stuff if they're
trying to save some coin that you're not
gonna be missing out a whole lot some
people in chat are pointing out you
would need a BIOS update for the x4 70
board which may or may not be a problem
for you depending on the type of board
it is there's quite a few motherboards
now that you can update the BIOS um just
with the USB stick without needing secu
installed right some though you would
need to get like if you got an older x4
70 board that didn't have a current BIOS
that was ready for rise in 3000 series
you'd need to get mm-hmm an existing
first or second generation CPU to drop
it in there to boot it actually update
the BIOS and then swap that out for your
3000 series to catch-22 that is so that
is that is a something that you might
have to worry about if you were going
for that set up yeah but yeah in that
case I would recommend going for like an
asus motherboard that has USB BIOS
flashback or gigabyte and MSI have those
features as well
I forget what they called a / easy flat
yeah something like that African name
that's what you'd be concerned about
yeah
beyond that the light Cal said it's
mainly just PCI Express Gen 4 vs. Gen 3
yeah you only gonna get gen 3 with X 470
which probably has had a big deal unless
you really want to Gen 4 superfast this
is D okay Chris Warren $5 gigabyte X 370
gaming 5 good enough for 8 cores n 2
overclocking a gigabyte X 370 gaming 5
Burnett core I don't exist so I'm not
directly familiar with like the power
delivery setup on that motherboard the 5
Series the gaming 5 series from gigabyte
mother from gigabyte are usually kind of
in the mid range so I would expect it to
be ok
yeah when you're talking about
overclocking performance for any given
motherboard chances are like the super
high-end boards or maybe gonna be able
to eke out an extra one or two hundred
megahertz out of a chip yeah compared to
lower end boards it's only the more
extreme situations like a super low-end
board at a super high on chip where
you'll have difficulty pushing any
overclock here's here the thing that I
think that whatever performance you know
hate that you would take from trying to
overclock on X 370 wouldn't be enough to
warrant buying an X 470 or X 570
motherboard so unless you actually
needed to milk that slight bit of
performance out of your seat view so if
you've already got the X 370 gaming 5
right go ahead and upgrade your CPU and
install it and you're good the human
journey $5 my biggest question is what
will be the sweet spot for AMD Ram good
question I have an answer for you
specifically for 3000 series there's an
interesting divider that happens when
you go over ddr4 3800 so the sweet spot
verizon 3000 series memory what they're
recommending is ddr4 3600 that's kind of
like 733 right yeah right you're getting
ahead of me like what we currently
recommend for Rison 1st and 2nd gen is
like third third
200 speed memory for third-gen it's
gonna be 3,600 speed memory it's kind of
that like that's what you that's where
you're gonna get the most bang for your
buck you should be able to get a kit for
that speed without spending too much
money for like you know the super
high-end kits or anything like that yeah
2030 637 33 hour good speeds once you go
to 3,800 it goes from a one to one ratio
with the Infinity fabric to 1 to 2 ratio
when it comes to the clock speed so
we're gonna need to wait and see
benchmark numbers on how that affects
performance of stuff like games and
everything does that mean the clock
speed actually gets cut in half once you
go beyond that it means that the
Infinity fabric whereas with 3600 is
ticking so like thirty six hundred
megahertz that's 3,600 times per second
huh actually that's thirty that's more
than that because megahertz isn't oh
yeah anyway that's that many times per
second that it's that it's ticking we're
infinity fabric is ticking at that speed
yeah go up to 3,800 infinity fabric is
ticking once for every to transfer every
two cycles I see so instead of 3,800
infinity fabric is actually gonna be
ticking at sixes half of 3816 oh no 18
is in 1800 no that's later in the show
so that's gonna be a question that comes
up like interest the faster memory speed
might be better for some scenarios the
slower infinity fabric tick speed might
might be detrimental to some scenarios
so that's that's gonna be a wait and see
sand scenario yeah okay there's you
probably can't find 30 37 33 memory oh
sorry there people sense it's 37 66 not
37 it's a memory divider points that
they'd have in the BIOS so you might not
be able to find memory that's at that
exact speed but if you find a faster
memory you can probably set it to run at
that divider right but yeah probably
3600 speed memory if you're looking at
Rison 3000 series is what you should be
looking at
cool okay next up we have cell
processing $5 thank yourself Excel hey
my my Nintendo one III breath of the
wild two and a Dark Crystal game and
John Romero of Doom Fame is making an
ex-con style game with 1930s gangsters
awesome that actually sounds pretty cool
I haven't seen any of that as far as the
XCOM stuff or the Dark Crystal game I
know why Vsauce would be excited about
that cuz you don't think that's a little
bit of a preview of that that game
you're talking about I didn't catch the
name of it though yeah
that is cool yeah Nintendo seem to have
a lot of good reception for this year's
been so long since I had a Nintendo
system I've only been able to like
switch is great yeah I really like to
switch because especially for someone
like me who has little time to game
apart from when I'm actually traveling
it's a console that allows you to travel
with it so it's like you can play
triple-a titles on the go C and I've
never been into portable game devices
ever since Gameboy came out like I just
never was really that into it mmm but
you're right a different experience that
might give me a better chance of
actually plenty of gaming but yeah the
Zelda games are probably what's been my
most the thing that's been made me think
like well maybe but for now Final
Fantasy 7 $5
let me both watch four years do you
think then think that soon is maxed out
already for OC I think Intel's a bigger
threat to NVIDIA GPUs what do you think
ah the Intel threat when it comes to the
GPU side is still very much in the ether
they have been gathering a lot of good
talent to their team true both on the
technical side as well as on the
marketing side some of the marketing
side stuff I've seen them do I've not
been that impressed with like they had a
bunch of the those those mock-up designs
for the graphics cards yeah and as
because because the guy who originally
did those just did that as a fan and
then they started getting spread around
and people like oh these are the designs
for Intel's new graphics cards and then
it turns out now it's just a fan-made
design but then Intel got in touch with
that guy on how to make some more and
then that was like their announcement
like hey look at these designs for the
GPUs and I'm like that's the
our cool designs that's good artwork but
is actually gonna be negative of the
real part of any of those designs
practical in any way like the steampunk
ones that show a little gears movie and
stuff like like like they're never
actually gonna make a graphics card that
looks like that so for me a lot of that
sort of amounted to fluff yeah
I appreciated the designs sure don't get
me wrong there at all and I think it is
cool to have unique and innovative
designs when it comes to that that side
of things right but it wasn't good
official marketing water and it's just
it's so early to determine what Intel is
actually going to come out with you
could look at it like Intel has been the
market leader for CPUs they should know
what they're doing they should come out
with a strong competitive product or you
could look at it like Intel's been
promising us ten nanometer for like
three plus years now and they still
haven't launched it and in AMD has come
up behind them and then launched seven
nanometer while they've been twiddling
their thumbs are doing whatever they've
been doing so I got it I don't know
that's right that's a good question I'm
just as curious as you are yeah as to
what the performance of those Intel
graphics cards are gonna be once they
actually finally come to market yeah
how's $5 well Rison 3000 multi-chip what
processors like the 12 and 16 core have
a game mode that shuts off half the
course through software bios like credit
for doesn't that's a good question too
they did have an updated version of the
rise and master utility the software
that you can use I didn't look at it to
see if that was a game mode thing they
could turn on and off but I think you
might actually not need it anymore if
you're using the updated version of
Windows 1903 or later the most recent
version because that fixes the Windows
10 scheduler the last me between the CCX
so yeah if you if you're using that
version then it's going to focus on a
single CCX and it's only going to start
using another CCX once one CCX
is utilized to its maximum right acity
right and that should fix a huge amount
of gaming issues because most games are
going to need more than four cores yeah
or threads so most games can just stick
to one cc X's and not worry about the
NRCC X latency yeah
so probably a good question when it
comes to like gaming mode versus creator
mode
and if you are doing something that uses
more but yeah I don't think it's quite
as bad as the Red River where you have
two dyes that could potentially aren't
directly connected to a memory
controller so yeah again that's probably
something we'll have to wait and see but
I think I think for at least the
mainstream Rhys and stuff that Windows
10 update is going to be a better
solution than switching game mode on or
off
hopefully that's case and finally we
have nubes for $10 hey guys I'm thinking
of upgrading from the 1700 to the 3700 I
have a gtx 1018 currently is it worth
upgrading to an art TX 2070 or 2080 or
see what Nabi offers I think the 1070 is
still a great card even if you're at
1440p he has a 1080 currently alright
sorry what did I say you said 1070 I'm
sorry if yeah I think the 1070 is great
for 1440p still obviously the RT X cards
in question are quite a bit faster it
kind of just depends on what kind of
what level of performance you're looking
for
I think the 1080 is still well matched
for a 3700 or it's going to be for an 8
a make or rise in 3000 CPU so it just
sort of depends on what your standards
are for the kind of frame rates you want
to see if you have a need or a desire
for ray tracing
real-time ray tracing capabilities that
is unless you're going na B which I
don't know
I think the 1080 is still a very
relevant card and I don't I don't see
much use in upgrading
to this generation right now if it were
if it were me personally I'd probably
wait another generation to upgrade my
1080i the attendees yeah really good
card I agree
all right quick shout outs to people who
donated money but we're not going to
answer your question because donations
were cut off sorry about that but Tobias
Wendler thank you very much yeah get it
RTX 2060 Jared Melton thank you very
much I am going to take a sip and I will
give you testing notes when I have them
I've got a couple Johnson's pokazhi
great bishop and Tim T I'm gonna answer
Tim T's questions expection expectations
for thread Ripper 3 or thread rapport
3000 series when it comes to core count
if you look at epic and the way they've
been configuring the shifflet's on epic
potentially up to 64 that's crazy
yeah eight of the eight core dies on a
single chip which is which is pretty
insane yeah that would be 64 cores 128
threads by the way all right we owe you
Johnson Johnson Jared Johnson Jared for
picking up a screw with confidence shirt
thank you sir we also have Michael C
screw with confidence as well and I've
got two more here one from Jonathan
thank you for picking up a screw with it
with screw of confidence file out the
shelves and one more Matthew with the
screw no aware of bottleneck Church
thanks for breaking the chain Jared gets
a double Johnson dumb job you also got
the bottle opener from the Paul's
hardware safe whoo mark from Utah
Johnson for you the captive thumb screw
shirt thank you nice that's a good shirt
let's go get your good shirt finally
Matthew Kay from Tennessee ate the
tri-blend thumbscrew shirt excellent
also an excellent choice thank you so
much Johnson's to all of you thank you
guys so much for joining us for awesome
Hardware this evening we had a great
time I hope you guys did too
yeah if you're still watching live and
you want something else to do now that
we're done streaming feel free to raid
twitch.tv slash unexceptional gamer
exactly how it's exactly how it's
spelled exceptional gamer we're gonna be
rating them on which
thanks again self for being here and
being awesome moderator and thanks to
you guys again for watching it's thumbs
up button if you want to and I'll
