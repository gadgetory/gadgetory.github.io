hardware my name is Paul and today I'm
gonna be doing a build that's right a
build using at least a couple of the
components that you can see right here
now this isn't what I would call like a
formal build video I'm not really gonna
say hey here's a build I set up and
here's the build that you guys should do
I'm not really gonna be saying hey
here's exactly how to do this whole
building process what I'm really going
to be doing is just assembling this
computer and I'm gonna point a camera at
it and I'm probably gonna be following
this up with the time-lapse of the
entire process and I'm probably gonna be
building and cleaning and then like
getting distracted and playing video
games and all sorts of other stuff but
who knows I'll probably include all of
that but a quick rundown of the parts at
least and I'm going to be using now
first off fractal design define our four
computer case and I'm going to be
following up in a separate video with
the review of this case in particular
the system is going to be based on this
gigabyte x79 su P 5 Wi-Fi motherboard
the motherboard is actually behind me
right now not particularly
that not currently in this box a couple
of the components I have a benefactor
friend who is letting me long term about
a 30 960 X processor to put in there so
that's gonna be pretty awesome
I have some kingston hyperx ddr3 1600
speed Ram I'm gonna be using I'm also
gonna be dropping in the thermal take
water 2.0 extreme closed-loop CPU cooler
in this case so it'll also be a little
bit of a test to see if this cooler
actually fits in here which I'm like 95%
sure that it will but we will see other
than that most of the other components
such as a power supply which is
currently in the system that's behind me
it's just other parts I'm bringing
together to sort of reassemble this case
and this is an I'm sorry reassemble this
build this is intended to be my primary
video editing system which will be in
the corner behind me and then that case
I'm going to be using for testing and
you'll all see in the future just just
keep watching my channel but anyway
that's pretty much my intro I'm not sure
if there will be an outro at the end of
this video so if there's not see you
later and here is the rest of my
Saturday
