hardware today I'm gonna be running
tests on this system right here which is
the April 2019 build of the months it
has been through some changes since I
originally parted out at the beginning
of this month though so let me explain
that first it started as a battle an
$1,100 build in the Coolermaster q 300 L
I wanted to make a micro ATX system that
was still very powerful then we
discovered that the Q 500 L and the cute
300 L from coolermaster don't have the
best air flow so they're not necessarily
gonna be suited for higher-end systems
like that at least not without some
modifications so pared it down to about
a $600 build featuring the just recently
released NVIDIA GTX 1650 which is about
$150 graphics card then there were some
delays that were unrelated discovered
that 1654 $150 maybe not the best
performance at that price point
especially when you compare it to the
Radeon rx 570 which is available in a
four gig and an 8 gig version so today
I'm gonna be testing the $600 version of
the system as is I'm going to be then
swapping in the rx 570 and seeing what
kind of difference in performance that
gets then I'm also going to do some
thermal testing since that seems to be
the weak spot in this case and we'll see
if we can improve that at all as well
all of that said though when I put this
system back together again as a $600
build I put in the wrong CPU so first
off we got a swap in the risin 5 1600
the Corsair 1 is a gaming PC for people
who want maximum performance with a
minimal footprint don't let the size
fool you though there's a core I $9.99
hundred K CPU and an Archie X xx atti in
the Corsair 1 I 160 kept chilly with
convection assisted cooling and separate
closed loops for the CPU and GPU there's
also a corsair 1 i 140 with an i7 9700 K
and an RT X 2080 so click the sponsor
link in the video description to learn
more
so good news guys
this system has now been reconfigured so
that it is pretty much exactly what you
guys might put together if you go by the
parts list that's down in this video
subscription for one instead of using a
fancy nvme SSD like the Intel 660 P that
I've been using I've gone with a
standard $50 500 gig SATA SSD which you
guys can get for about 50 bucks the
Terra 200 was what I have in there but
that's gonna be comparable performance
to a lot of $50.00 SATA SSDs part of the
reason I did that and I want to point
this out is that my motherboard is
actually defective I just want a little
snafus that have come up as I've been
building and testing the system so the
motherboard I am going to be RMA
but I don't have time to do that and
honestly it's just the MDOT two slots
that aren't currently working I tried a
bunch of different things to get them to
work but point is if you get this
motherboard double check here I'm two
slots if you can just to make sure
everything's functional that's a good
idea to do when you get any particular
new piece of hardware especially
something like a motherboard that might
have lots of different potential points
of failure but upshot is the
configuration is now really really close
to that 600 dog build that you guys will
put together yourselves and the cooler
that is shipping with the horizon 1600
which I don't know if this was always
the case you have to go back and
double-check but we are getting the
Wraith spire rather than the race
stealth so that means it is a taller
cooler that has copper at the base and
it also means it is functionally
equivalent to the RGB Wraith aspire that
I have installed in there so I was able
to keep my fancy RGB one in there so
it's gonna look a little bit prettier
that's the only real difference but the
cooling performance should be exactly
the same as the one that you get out of
the box with a risin v 1600 that said we
are not ready to begin our testing we're
fast-forwarding in time a few hours we
have run a significant amount of tests
on this system and a couple different
configurations and now I'm gonna share
those test results with you I ran a
couple synthetic tests ran some gaming
tests and then finally did that thermal
test as well and I think there's maybe
more to be said about the thermal test
but let's start off with 3dmark first we
ran fire strike extreme which is a
DirectX 11 test extreme runs at 2560 by
1440 by the way and our GTX 1650 scored
three thousand eight hundred and thirty
points overall with the three thousand
eight hundred and sixty one point
graphics core CPU score was just shy of
fifteen thousand but compare that to the
rx 570 which score
5565 overall and 5,000 847 for the
graphics there is a 2000 point lead here
for the graphics core bear in mind again
this is a synthetic test so this isn't
gonna bear out over all games that you
might test but here at least is a big
win initially for the rx 570 next up is
3d mark time spy this is a DirectX 12
test and here the GTX 1650 scored 3568
overall with a 3347 point graphics core
CPU scores 5,000 718 the RX 570 again
beat it with a score 4021 overall and
3826 for the graphics core CPU score
again here stays the same since we're
talking about the same CPU with both
tests running at the same speed next up
is GTA 5 still a very popular game it's
running at 1920 by 1080 DirectX 11 and
I'm using my lower end settings for this
test since these are entry-level
graphics cards so sliders are down to
minimum msaa is turned off and you can
see the rest of the settings here but
the gtx 1650 score was 136 FPS on
average and 1% low of 95 FPS the RX 570
did beat it but it was by a very slim
margin 138 FPS on average so only about
1% as the same at 95 FPS for the 1% low
scores so this is just an example of how
depending on the game that you're
playing the settings you're using and
the resolution you might see varying
results when it comes to how much faster
the RX 570 is then the gtx 1650 but we
can't say more definitively now that it
is faster pretty much across the board
except for a few outliers if you'd like
to see a wider range of benchmarks
though i'll point you guys to hardware
unboxed because steve has done a couple
videos now on the 1650 and he tested
more games than I did so check the link
in the description below if you want to
see that video next let's move into some
real world game testing for this we used
overwatch and apex legends I played
overwatch Joe played apex legends for
overwatch I turned the settings down to
high I usually test it epic but we are
at 100% render scale at 1920 by 1080 and
the GTX 1650 was getting about 120 230
frames per second on average very
playable definitely at the these
settings and at this resolution and you
could even turn these settings up a
little bit so you can see if you're
playing at 1920 by 1080 and you're
looking for 60 frames per second if
you're looking for a higher frame rate
for example if you've invested in a high
frame rate 1080 display that has a
fresh rate of 100 Hertz or maybe 144
Hertz then you want a frame rate that
will match that refresh rate of the
monitor if at all possible fortunately a
hundred and twenty two hundred and
thirty FPS is pretty decent for a
sixteen fifty we did have dips down to
about a hundred FPS but again staying
very playable the whole time however if
you were gonna play on one of those high
refresh rate monitors I'd recommend the
rx 570 because here I was getting a
hundred and sixty two hundred and ninety
frames per second it was significantly
better the dips were only down to the
one 30s and one 40s so if you're playing
on a one hundred forty four Hertz 1080
monitor the RX 570 would definitely give
you a better experience here at least
you see more frames which is typically
what you wants when you're playing on a
high refresh rate monitor next is Apex
Legends this is also at 1920 by 1080 and
here's a quick look at the settings
we're using they were medium settings
I'll say for the most part but you can
pause if you want to look specifically
at each one I'm gonna give you 3 FPS
ranges here the first is for the drop in
part at the very beginning of each map
and that tends to be a much lower frame
rate at least in my experience then I'll
talk about the average frame rates and
then the high frame rates for the drop
in part for the GTX 1650 we're looking
at 45 to 55 frames per second still very
playable obviously you don't want to be
running at that frame rate by and large
but that's okay because when actually
in-game the low frame rates we were
saying we're in the 70s and 80s frames
per second wise and then the high frame
rates we're seeing we're up in the 90s
and 100's so again very playable
across-the-board especially if you're
looking for 1080 60 Hertz gameplay but
once again with the rx 570 we saw a
significantly improved experience the
drop in frame rate was about 55 to 75
FPS on the low end we were seeing 80 to
110 at frames per second I did want to
point out there's a few things that can
happen in the game like that pop up a
depth of field effect for example that
can really tank the frame rate we didn't
experience that with a GTX 16:50 run
that we played with the RX 570 it
actually dropped down into the 40s
briefly so consider turning that effect
off or minimizing it as much as you can
if you're trying to maintain higher
frame rates while playing apex legends
but by and large we were getting low
frame rates from the 80 all the way up
to 110 FPS range and then we were seeing
highs in 110 to 130 FPS range it
depended on where you were on the map
some rooms are a lot simpler and can
actually render at a higher frame rate
so we saw 144 FPS P
but overall I would say we're achieving
between 15 to 30 FPS higher performance
than the 1650 I recorded a few stats as
we were going through testing the r5
1600 CPU by the way since we are just
using the stock cooler I left at the
stock frequency that means that on all
cores it's running at 3.4 gigahertz and
for boost on 1 or 2 cores at a time it's
going up to 3.7 gigahertz pretty
confident that you could overclock that
and jump it up to maybe 3.8 or 3.9
gigahertz across a few cores at least
but perhaps I will leave that for a
future video
since the motherboard unfortunately
wasn't working for us quite as well as
we had hoped
I didn't dive into the overclocking
realm for this particular video but the
gtx 1650 was hitting 67 degrees celsius
max temperatures so that i suppose is a
testament to its efficiency and even in
this case which is pretty bad when it
comes to air flow we weren't getting too
hot and the fan also did not need to
ramp up all that loud so in this quick
anecdotal noise test you will notice
that the 1650 is fairly quiet
whereas the system with the RX 570
installed in a stress test environment
is noticeably louder
I will also note that while we were game
testing this system with the rx 570 the
rx 570 actually got hotter than in the
stress test and the stress test I was
using 3dmark on loop and that will
actually start a test and then turn it
off and then start it again so under the
sustain load of gaming the rx 570
actually got up to 78 degrees Celsius
two degrees warmer than the 76 degrees
that it got up to during the stress test
I'm getting a little ahead of myself
though 67c again was the max temp for
the GTX 60 and 50 it was running at 1920
megahertz max GPU boost clock but I
found that under load it was averaging
about 1800 megahertz it will fluctuate
between about 1755 to 1830 depending on
what was going on on screen rx 570 again
hits 78 degrees Celsius max temp and at
that temperature the fans were very loud
and it was noticeable if you were gaming
right next to this it's not gonna be the
most positive experience you'd probably
want some clothes headphones or it's
just something that you would have to
learn to deal with we're gonna try to
get around that in just a second but in
case you're wondering the frequency that
the RX 570 is running at is 1280
megahertz finally for power draw this
was taken during the fire strike extreme
combines test the gtx 1650 system 130
watts the RX 570 system 243 watts that's
that's a lot more that's a little over a
hundred watts more sustained power draw
so Steve if you're watching this video
you claimed 70 watts maybe it depends on
the card you're talking about I was
testing the entire systems power draw
from the wall so that also might be a
factor but just again something to
consider you are going to draw more
power with the RX 570 it's still not
nearly the amount of power that you
would draw with like a 300 or a $500
graphics card and as Steve also pointed
out in one of his follow-up videos the
amount of extra money that you're gonna
pay for the extra power draw when you're
comparing this card to this one it's
probably gonna be like 5 to 20 dollars a
year so that may or may not be a
significant dollar amount for you so
those I think are hopefully some good
numbers for you guys and again pretty
decisive in my opinion when it comes to
what you should choose if you're
building a $600 ish system when it comes
to the graphics card you're probably
gonna be spending around a hundred and
fifty dollars if you're looking at that
price point for your entire build and at
150 bucks you should be getting an rx
570 I
Deeley an 8 gig RX 570 because i've seen
those on sale for 140 or 150 dollars
actually cheaper than the four gigs 1650
and if you can claw your way up you know
you can get an rx 580 but anyway I don't
wanna get into that game point being
there's one last problem we got to deal
with here
the 1650 in the system with a stress
test I had a 64 CPU and memory as well
as 3d marked fire strike on loop got up
to 67 degrees Celsius on the GPU 67
point five degrees Celsius on the CPU
that's actually not too bad especially
given the thermal performance of this
case as expected however we're dealing
with a very low-power jock card so when
we dropped in the RX 570 things got
significantly warmer the CPU temperature
ramped up to seventy three point four
degrees and the GPU temperature got up
to 76 degrees and I'm confident that if
I left the test run longer we were only
running it for about 10 minutes it would
have kept getting warmer beyond that the
reason as gamers Nexus and a few other
people who have reviewed this case have
pointed out is that while you have this
nice mesh cover in the front which you
can remove to clean dust off of it and
does have a fair amount of perforations
to let air through behind it you have a
metal panel with a bunch of holes
drilled in it and there are more there's
more metal panel than there is holes
filled in it so I'm going to do a very
simple mod on this case I'm gonna use my
dremel if you guys buy this case you're
welcome to attempt this mod as well but
bear in mind once you take a dremel to a
case like this you're not going to be
able to return it or anything so so do
so at your own risk but we'll be back in
just a second with the updated version
of the q 300 L we'll see if it improves
our thermal performance at all
so modding is always fun I basically
just took my Dremel and cut a chunk off
the front of the case a size that would
fit the hundred and forty millimeter
intake fan that I had positioned up
there didn't do too you know Shoei of a
job because I knew that it was just
gonna be covered up by this mesh that
beautiful nearly unobstructed airflow
until you put the dust filter in from it
and was this the game-changer that we
are looking for when it comes to making
this case a much more usable case or at
least a better thermal situation a
little slightly basically we had about a
two and a half degree improvement on CPU
temperature we went from seventy-three
point four degrees Celsius down to 71
degrees Celsius under the stress test
conditions after ten minutes and the GPU
temperature dropped by two degrees
Celsius from 76 down to 74 so that is a
results that is an improvements ambient
temperature here in the garage probably
crept up a tiny tiny bit in between as
well since it got a little bit later in
the day but overall I think what this
case needs is just more of the same
doing that twice and doing two intake
fans and perhaps adding an exhaust up
here at the top would greatly help to
evacuate the hot air that builds up in
this case especially since the rear
exhaust hundred and twenty millimeter
fan here is also partially obstructed on
either side so it's not really ejecting
as much hot air as it could all that
said if you're willing to deal with the
temperature in various ways whether it's
a modification or whether it's running
things at lower speeds or trend under
bolts this is still a viable system and
for $600 I think it is pretty powerful a
lot of people would be quite happy with
it what I'm thinking is that this case
in my mind was going to be like the new
micro ATX case to recommend some micro
ATX is one of those form factors that I
feel like I want to push a little bit
more I feel like it has a really nice
balance between expandability and size
but let me know in the comments you guys
if you know of any really awesome micro
ATX cases that you think I should try
out because I'm looking for something
they
keep things compact still flexible still
expandable and this case needs I think a
little bit of work maybe a second
revision in order for it to really hit
all the points that cool and master is
trying to hit especially when it comes
to air flow and thermals that said this
system for $600 I think is absolutely
insane when it comes to actual gaming
performance so I think anyone would be
happy with it just like I said go with
an Rx 578 gig if you can find it because
you can get those for a hundred forty
two hundred and sixty bucks these days
I'll put a link to one or two of those
down in the video's description as for
these 1650 it has a niche area where
it's applicable I think Kyle's video did
the best of demonstrating that if you
happen to have a much older system and
you're running off of integrated
graphics and you need a boost and you
don't have a strong power supply and the
CPU is ok then dropping in something
like this is viable that said if you've
got the power supply to support
something like an rx 570 you're really
going to get a better experience overall
out of that so I think what we're really
looking for with the 1650 is a price
break this needs to be less expensive
that will make it more competitive and I
think that is gonna wrap up this video
thank you guys so much for watching the
parts I used today once again are linked
down in the description if you're down
there and you want hit the thumbs up
button on your way up so I greatly
appreciate that too thanks again for
watching and we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
