Pauls hardware today I'm going to be
doing an unboxing and overview of this
wireless gaming headset from astro this
is the a 50 it's designed for use with
the Xbox Playstation 3 or of course PC
alright guys so here is a closer look at
the Astro 850 Wireless and let me say
about this one this is a very popular
headset this is only the successor to be
very popular 840 which has been out for
a while and astro makes some really high
quality headsets they're very popular
for use with gaming of course this one
is set up for xbox ps3 and pc use 5.8
gigahertz Wireless band also Dolby Pro
Logic - yes no I always forget it I can
never tell that's 2x or 11x and every
time I'm not sure I look it up and then
I immediately forget anyway I'll leave
it at that for now here's a look at the
back of the box we can see pro quality
audio with EQ modes superior fit and
finish this is an over the ear headset
it also includes a precision microphone
and it's tuned with astro audio again
5.8 gigahertz wireless technology and
built-in mix amp 5.8 so here's kind of a
layout of everything that comes in the
box headset stand
item number 3 there which is of course
your MX mix amp TX transmitter it's
actually the newer txd includes EQ modes
accessible via the side of the Year Cup
you also have a volume wheel also on the
side of that your cup game and voice
balance which you can essentially do by
actually accessing the right side of the
ear cap your cup so I'll show you guys
that in just a moment also lovely 7.1
channel compatible so you can actually
do multiple channel audio and this has
become more popular for gaming in
particular because positional audio can
often be a boon to those folks who
especially playing like first-person
shooter type games you also have an
auxiliary inputs that's on the actual
trans transmitter transmitter / receiver
then you also have an optical
pass-through so if you're using a gaming
system that has optical well you can
pass through it and that way you can
still access your audio even if you're
for instance switching it over from
using the headset to home theater for
example here's the specs trans do these
are open air so bear that in mind they
are not going to be blocking very much
outside noise but that can often be good
frequency response of twenty to twenty
thousand kilohertz I heard two kilohertz
I should say also nominal impedance of
forty eight ohms the weight without the
cable is 0.8 pounds it is a little bit
heavier than the eight forty you also
have 108 decibels signal-to-noise ratio
you're coupling is over the ear
distortion of less than one percent
connectors a 2.5 millimeter xbox live
chat port as well as a mini USB
I also the mic which is unidirectional
and noise cancelling you also have that
in other languages USB power 5.8
gigahertz optical in ox in some more
details also the contents of the Box
listed right there which I'm going to be
pulling out in just a moment there
support information for the Astra
website let's go ahead and pop this out
of the box and take a closer look we
have a sleeve and it simply opens like
that alright the first item that we have
here is the mix amp TX transmitter as
you can see it's got the Astra logo on
the top sort of a semi-gloss finish you
have power button right there as well as
the Dolby button right there that you
can activate look around to the back you
can see this is the mixing up to TX D
which is like slightly newer revision
and it's got it does have some rubber
here on the bottom as well so that
wherever you're setting it down it's not
going to shift around too much and then
here's a look at the back so we have an
auxilary input previously-mentioned USB
so it does get power directly from the
USB these are some Toslink connectors
right there that are currently covered
up so you have the optical Toslink out
as well as input
and then you also have a USB port right
there
next up the head football side so here's
a look at the a 50 headset I should say
not just headphones headsets so how does
this work ah let's just push this so now
this is basically your balance you can
adjust your balance for voice or for the
game audio and it's got a nice little
detent there so you can tell when you're
pushing one way or another before I talk
about the ear cups and the rest of the
construction I did want to point to the
other on the left ear cup we have a
connector there so if you're going to
use Xbox Live you connect a cable from
here down to your Xbox controller and
then you can actually do the Xbox Live
voice you also have a USB port right
there and that is to charge this headset
since it does have an integrated
rechargeable battery over on this side
you have volume knob so some nice
detents in that as well as you're
returning it so you can tell that you're
moving it one way or another the volume
knob and then over here we have a small
power button so this is a set up for
power to power it on as well as to pair
it with the mix amp TX over here and the
same function goes for that power button
on that one and you also have this
several position item right here and I
think this changes between several
different modes however I'm not positive
since this is my first look at this
particular headset so before I sort of
give us a second look at this I'm
actually going to go through the rest of
the item is in the box which might shed
some light on some of that other stuff
all right
oops alright so this is a little card
welcoming you to the Astro family and
encouraging you to register your your
headset so you get support from them and
then here's a look at the included
instruction manual as you can see it's
pretty well laid out indicating of
course all that stuff I've just told you
aha so here's where we can sell for the
EQ modes these are different built in
it's got a built-in equalizer in the ear
cup so medium mode core mode and pro
mode I'm not sure what exactly
differentiates those but you
switch between them via that handy
switch xbox live USB charging port
microphone gaming voice bounce here's
information on pairing up the device
using the power button and different
blinking lights to indicate they've
paired up and then here's more
information on that mix amp so the USB
port is actually for power to the mix
amp and then USB power right there I'm
sorry the USB port right there's for
charging the headset and then this one
is actually for power into the mix amp
you also notice here they are indicating
that's oh this is actually a pretty cool
feature so the included boom mic right
here when it's down it's on if you got
to mute it simply flip it up like that
so you flip it up that automatically
meets the mic here the included cables
which I haven't even shown you yet but
this will show you different
configurations you can do so if you're
using Xbox for example you connect the
mix amp be an optical cable in a USB
power cable and then you go ahead and
plug your xbox live cable into your xbox
controller for PlayStation 3 pretty much
the same optical cable and USB power
cable however that will give you a game
audio as well and you don't need the
extra cable going over to your
controller then finally for PC again
optical or USB power cable or if you
don't happen to have an optical on your
computer that's it I think most
computers do have it integrated one way
or another but if you don't you can of
course plug in straight via that aux
inputs which is in standard eight inch
jack here's the stand doesn't come with
an included stand that's about it for
the manual alright moving on to included
cables so here this is the Xbox cable
tiny little plugs right there so you can
connect it to your Xbox for Xbox audio
and headset use here's your USB cable
there so standard USB to mini-usb we
have another standard USB to mini-usb so
you can use one of these again to plug
in the Astro for power just run it over
to a USB plug on your
computer or your Xbox or your
PlayStation 4 power and then the other
end of course goes into here like so
sobbing all right now let's take a look
at the stand which I've heard kind of
snaps together oh look there's one more
hidden cable here all right so this is
an actual Toslink cable
there's your optical cable as well which
they've also included and again kind of
need that to get up and running so that
is also nice of them let me assemble the
stand for you guys really quick and then
we'll take a look so here's a stand set
up it simply snaps together and I'm just
going to go ahead and set the heads in
art there you have it pretty simple it
keeps it up and off of the ground and a
little bit more protected then finally
one last look at the headset itself
we've already talked about the boom mic
this is permanently attached which is
something of an issue for some folks but
if you're okay with having it on the
left side you should be fine got the
embroidered Astro logo up on the top
it's a nice padding here headrest of
course really nice cushioning here in
the cuff and ear cups and you can of
course twist these any which way you
please and then we also have these
really sturdy metal adjustment brackets
here on the side you can see the coil
kind of where the cord kind of coils up
inside there the rest of it is mostly
constructed of some pretty sturdy
plastic but that keeps it nice and light
the movement points here are still nice
and sturdy though and trying these on I
can say they're very comfortable and I
haven't given them much of a play test
yet but it does feel like you could wear
these for hours on end and that's gonna
wrap it up for my unboxing of the Astro
a50 wireless gaming sound system
including the a 50 headset as well as
the mix amp t XD you've been watching
