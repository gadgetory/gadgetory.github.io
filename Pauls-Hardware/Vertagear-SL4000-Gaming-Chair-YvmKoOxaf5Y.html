Paul's hardware I am doing a video I'm
out of my dining room I'm surrounded on
all sides by all the trappings of my
continuing project to organize all the
stuff that I have that's going to be
material for an additional upcoming
video I'm going to be doing some
inventory out here so stay tuned for
that don't forget to subscribe and all
that good stuff but today I'm actually
doing a product video something I
haven't done in a couple weeks so kind
of trying to get back to my usual stuff
but definitely not a product of the
types that I've ever done a video on
before it's a chair it's in this big box
right here it's from vertigo
it's the SL 4000 and when very gear hit
me up and asked me if I wanted to take a
look my immediate thought was to think
about the chair I'm sitting in right now
which is the chair I've been using for
the past Oh 8 to 10 years it's in a bit
of a sorry state so let's take a look at
this chair first and some of the reasons
why I might be interested in upgrading
to maybe something a little bit better
so my current chair came from office max
I believe before they shut down they
even exist anymore I think they might
all shut down but I'm it cost me 100 or
so dollars this was a little bit after
it started working at Newegg and I
wanted something that was just a little
bit nicer than chairs I'd been using
before this chair is pretty nice I mean
it's it's leather right as you can see
I've spent many hours playing video
games and editing videos and whatnot in
here so it's got like the traditional
wearing a way of the the pads for the
elbows this was one requirement though
when I was shopping for the chair I
wanted to have elbow pads for one thing
you may notice this extra pillow right
here I'm going to take that out for a
moment so you can see it's gotten lots
of wear down here on the bottom like
nori when she was a puppy decided to
take a liking to some of the little
rubber or like plastic covers on these
so she chewed some of those off so you
know but it's got all the kind of basic
functions you want it can go up and down
it can lean back if you want it to the
things that's missing for me are height
adjustment for the elbow elbow wrists
but that is why I have this
affectionately known as my ass pillow
that is my ass pillow and it's there so
that when I sit in the chair
I'm raised up because what I noticed
when I first got it my elbows would sit
up too high my shoulders would hunched
up
and I end up getting some like neck pain
especially after like this was back when
I was playing World of Warcraft for
hours and hours on end so got the ass
pillow it was kind of an in-between and
you know I didn't like doing that
because I had paid full price for the
chair and everything but it was too late
to return by the time I discovered that
problem so I've been living with it but
enough about my existing chair I'm going
to go ahead and build this verdaguer
chair it comes all flat pack so you got
to do some assembly at home I don't even
know what color this one actually is
it's available in five different colors
I believe sort of a darker red green
white black and blue and I have no idea
which one this is kind of hoping it's
black but I'll deal with whatever so the
SL 4000 comes very well packed it has
nice dense closed cell foam and I
getting out of the box wasn't too
difficult comes with everything you need
to assemble all together including a set
of Allen wrenches and if the screws that
you need aren't in little baggy
they're actually pre-installed you just
undo them in order to attach whatever
part you need to attach with them and
screw it back in as far as materials
this chair is actually made of steel as
far as the frame goes as well as the
five star base it's got some aluminum
alloy wheels which have a nice soft
Glide and they're also very durable
without being too heavy it's also got
PVC leather as far as the finish on the
outside so it's got a very nice premium
leather feel it is pretty breathable as
well which is important if you don't
want to get too hot while you're gaming
it'll support a maximum load of up to
150 kilograms so should be fine for most
folks and it also comes with a two-year
warranty from verdaguer as far as
assembly itself goes I didn't really
have too much trouble getting it
together well I had a little bit of
trouble I'll be honest getting these
side pieces on over here just since the
chair is assembled and rotates as you
try to push it and you have to kind of
search in there with that screw to find
the mounting hole for it that was a
little bit of a pain but honestly I was
able to get through it with only being
one person having a second person to
help I would definitely make that way
way easier also as far as assembly goes
this lower quarter piece here actually
did not come pre-installed so the
instructions didn't include that but
this came separately
all I had to do is remove a little
Phillips head screwdriver there in order
to pop that on but that was one thing
that was omitted from the instruction
manual just in case you're building this
in the future not too difficult to
figure out but wanted to point it out in
anyway you also get a couple nice
pillows that come along with the entire
chair so you get a head pillow up at the
top and you get a lumbar support pillow
down at the bottom those are optional of
course but they're they just snap on
with some elastic straps and I like them
actually I'm going to probably keep them
on there they're very comfortable as far
as a usability and functionality of the
chair first off let's start off with
armrests since that was a sticking point
with my former chair these arm rests are
like almost I don't want say infinitely
flexible as far as how you can set them
up but they are pretty flexible so
basically have four points of
adjustments you can slide the armrest
itself forward or back you can also
angle it out or angle it in towards you
if that's your thing they've got a
little bit of slide back and forth like
inwards and outwards like towards you or
away from you you could actually extend
that more if you went underneath and
loosen some of those bolts down they
could actually slide that entire armrest
support mechanism out a little bit
although that would take a little bit
more work doing you also have height
adjustment as well so all of these are
of course adjustable while you're
sitting down via little little squeezy
buttons that you squeeze and then do
your adjustments not too difficult and
again keeping your elbows supported is
very nice I was a little bit concerned
about the lack of padding on the
armrests although that's not really true
they are padded it's a little bit
stiffer foam padding than I originally
thought I thought it was plastic first
but it does have a little bit of give a
little bit of squish and I think it'll
be pretty comfortable for most folks you
do have capability so you can tilt the
whole chair back by pulling out the
little knob on the side and you can also
adjust via the knob that's on the very
bottom of the chair again a little bit
more difficult to do but you just
probably need to do that once depending
on your weight you can adjust that so
that when you're tilting back it's going
to give a little bit more easily a
little bit more difficult or have a
little bit more resistance depending on
your weight of course so that you can do
that comfortably I'll control but via
these knobs over here you can actually
lay the entire back of the chair back
170 degrees so you can almost lay it
flat so that makes it great for taking a
nap I guess in between gaming sessions
then finally of course
there's a piston way down on the bottom
and that will allow you to raise or
lower the overall height of the chair
it's best to keep it at a height that
keeps your allows you to keep your feet
flat on the ground without being lifted
off and I will say this is a larger
chair I am just shy of 6 feet tall maybe
510 or 511 and even in the lowest
position my feet were pretty much
sitting where they should be so this is
going to be good if for a larger for a
larger frame or an average frame I'd say
but if you have a smaller frame you
might need to either put something down
on the floor for your feet to sit on or
maybe consider getting a smaller model
of chair so guys that's a birdie here SL
4000 you're probably gonna be seeing
this one around I'm going to be sitting
in it during our live show and forcing
Kylie's some inferior chair making fun
of him because of it let me have you
think though this is my first video on
like furniture I guess so hope you have
enjoyed it I don't have a lot of racing
chairs or anything so I'm not going to
do like tell you how this compares to
other ones but maybe I'll try some other
ones out so I can give you guys more
feedback on that but I will say based on
some reviews and whatnot that I read
online prior to accepting this chair
because I wanted to make sure I was
gonna you know be telling you guys about
a high quality product this gets really
well review really good reviews online
and I can tell definitely based on the
build quality and everything that you're
you're getting a pretty decent bang for
your buck with this anyway I'll post the
link to this in the description don't
forget to hit the like button on your
way out if you enjoyed this video I'll
be back very soon with more stuff like
this stuff and that stuff I know that
you never mind don't don't look at any
of that stuff thanks for watching this
video though guys and we'll see you next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
