worklog it's been a few months since I
did one of these and it's high time I
did another one this is gonna be I guess
kind of a spring cleaning garage work
log although it's still another week
until spring actually rise but hey
getting started early I wanted to begin
this video by doing a shirt yet overly
ambitious list of what I intend to get
them today so you guys can judge me on
whether or not I actually accomplished
it all so let's let's start with that
so my desk area over here is actually in
pretty good shape this is where I've
been getting most of my work done over
the past couple months but I've shown
you in a couple videos the situation on
this side of the garage which is that I
have some tables and there's just lots
of stuff piled precariously and whereas
I would classify this stuff over here as
grouped I would not classify it as
organized so for example this box right
in front here is my cables box and I've
been finding it more and more difficult
to fish cables out of there I need to go
through all those cables separate the
useful ones from the non useful ones and
all that kind of stuff
also if you watch any of my garage work
logs toward the end of 2015 you saw me
put up shelves and stuff over here again
I have more to add more shelves to put
up this cupboard that I installed is
also sort of wedged and packed full of
stuff but it's not very well organized
in there so there's some of that stuff
of course there's still the sort of
general cleaning stuff that I need to do
over here you need to like sweep off the
floor just do some dusting you know all
that's boring but there's also like
these details down here that I still
haven't taken care of which is for
instance this isn't painted the upper
parts painted but the lower part is not
so I'm going to hopefully paint the
entire underneath below the desks here
to clean that up quite a bit and then I
will even potentially potentially
depending on how everything goes I'm
gonna pull up some of this sound
dampening material that I put in the
back here it's not even along the bottom
and I want to do LED lighting behind
this shelf and probably behind this
shelf as well if I'm ambitious and
things go well today I will also start
pulling up some of this stuff after I've
painted under here and I like it all
that goodness and getting the LEDs maybe
started to sit up again
that's a stretch goal so we'll see if I
actually get to that so some cleaning
some organizations some painting I gotta
set up some time lapses of course got to
crank some tunes I need to run to the
hardware store real quick and then I'm
gonna get to work
wish me luck
so if you've made it this far
congratulations you have now come to the
end of the video and I'm going to show
you guys real quick what I've
accomplished what I have not
accomplished as well as a surprise
ending that I had no idea was even gonna
be possible when I started making this
garage work log
for starters over here's the main work
area and this should hopefully look
roughly the same as it did before there
is a few more stuff stashed up on the
shelves up there but that's what they're
there for so that's all good
and then down here is my plaster of
Paris working materials because as you
might immediately notice I did not get
as far as doing all the painting in here
I did start doing my plaster of Paris
covering of this bottom part right here
which is gone along pretty well just was
taking longer than I expected so I did
that until about 1:00 a.m. last night
and then I gave up so what I'm probably
gonna do is finish this out and paint it
and not even do a video about it unless
I do a video on the LEDs which is the
other thing I did not accomplish that
that but that's all everything else I
did get a lot done with Wow check it out
over here so this table is completely
cleared off I should also say these
tables are all completely cleared off
because those were pretty cluttered and
piled with stuff while I was doing the
in-between but I was able that I'm able
to use this table again that's fabulous
my huge pile over there is much smaller
you might notice size-wise has greatly
reduced a lot of the boxes are gone this
is actually new stuff there most
everything else I was able to fit up on
those shelves on the wall but I do have
space over here to stash like chairs and
you know
stands and all that good stuff there's
the shelves I installed with boxes on
them here's my workbench which is
looking pretty pretty tidy as well so
I'm happy about that and then the last
thing that I accomplished that I was
really happy with today was hey look I
have actual look at that handles handles
on my cupboard right here so open that
up you can see the top shelf which is
still looking pretty piled and cluttered
these are mostly bags and backpacks and
stuff what I'm going to do is put some
hooks up in the top so I can hang this
stuff this is fairly organized but bags
and some tripods this is camera gear
unfortunately a lot of it is still in
this box but this is much more organized
than it was a couple boxes of things
there you notice that
labels on them and then what you
probably saw me doing a lot of last
night which was the organization of all
my cables those are now all separated
into different bins with labels on them
and then the fans are all there in the
middle I have a box of LEDs need to get
those to work and look I even installed
a little drawer here this is the drawer
with a bunch of water cooling components
in it so hey cool look how functional my
actual cupboard is now that's super
super nice so that's all it is goes all
the way up to the ceiling
I also stash some stuff on top there
additional storage up on top and finally
here's my surprise ending look this is
Hiro everybody say hi to Hiro Hiro is a
new addition to our family he we just
picked him up from the Rancho Cucamonga
dog shelter or pet shelter and he is
just super super mellow he's a totally
he's like mellow and friendly and super
super just chill to be wherever and how
he's just resting my lunging on the
floor we got him a new bed and a new
collar and stuff like that he's seven
years old he is a rescue he's about 80
pounds and look at him spreading up for
you guys there so you can see how large
he actually is about 80 pounds he's a
mastiff and a pitbull and we're hoping
to be his forever home here and we
picked him up because he was just well a
lot of it is cuz he's super sweet he has
a very very nice mellow demeanor I think
I'll be able to get videos done just
fine with him hanging around but also
our existing dog you who you're probably
familiar with nori she also she was
initially a little standoffish but
fortunately after we gave her a little
bit more time to kind of can't get
comfortable she's totally cool with him
too so guys this is Hiro all all
throw-ins videos you know when he
happens to appear by the way his name
was originally peewee we've decided to
rename him hero because he looks like a
hero right I think he looks like a hero
anyway I hit the thumbs-up button if you
enjoyed this video thank you guys so
much for watching subscribe to the
channel all that good stuff in the
meantime here is gonna take a nap I'm
gonna go get some more work done thank
