all-in-one liquid CPU cooler has a
massive contact plate made just for
thread Ripper and is rated for 500 watts
of heat dissipation high pressure pwm
fans mount two rubber channels on the
radiator to absorb vibration and the
sexy logo and edge lighting on the block
is addressable for syncing with your
motherboard
it comes with an RGB control box - so
click the spots or link in the
description for more what's up guys
how's it going welcome back to Pauls
hardware I have been very busy over the
past seven month month and a half and as
a result I have neglected Riptide
Riptide is the build that I did this
summer is the most expansive and crazy
water cooling build that I have yet put
together it all started when Corsair
sort of accidentally sent me the 1000 d
case and they're like hey Paul we sent
you this case you think you could do a
video on it I was like well it's already
here and it's huge I don't know what
else I'm gonna do with it so yes then it
evolved into me creating an upper system
that is a workstation also gaming
capable station and a lower system that
is a FreeNAS build and I documented all
this in a build series over the summer
so feel free to check out the playlist
if you want to watch that process and
get yourself up to speed most recently I
did a lighting test on this where I
demonstrated some of the capabilities of
the Corsair IQ lighting software and in
that video I also revealed that one of
my two pumps has failed so today I am
going to be upgrading the system
swapping out a couple of parts that
aren't working anymore I also had this
processor just arrived this is the 2970
WX I did not tell them to send this they
just sent it and it's here it's 24 Core
so it's an upgrade from the 16 core 2950
X that's currently in there both our
thread Ripper - of course and then I am
planning a follow-up video to this
because I need to integrate this into my
computer room and I need to build a
stand for it so that's coming in the
future - but else wise in today's video
I will be swapping in of course new
alpha cool replacement pump they
actually sent me a full replacement pump
as well as just the pump unit itself two
slots into there so I guess I've got
options there we also have and this was
all purchased directly from Newegg which
is why it's a new egg box I spent like
$1,200 on SSD storage for this build
specifically we have two one terabyte
Samsung 970 evos for some really high
speed MDOT - nvme storage and then we've
got a couple a SanDisk Ultra
- terabyte drives because there's really
no space
me to add mechanical drives to this
upper system and it's supposed to be a
video editing system so I need plenty of
storage space for some 4k footage so
these are probably go gonna go into raid
one so that they're going to back each
other up and I have a bit of redundancy
and these are gonna go into raid zero so
I'll have two terabytes of fast but a
little bit of dangerous storage there
and I'll have four terabytes well two
terabytes effectively of redundant
storage and these two drives finally I
also have an upgraded mono block because
as I mentioned when I first put the
system together
alpha cool makes a very nice CPU block
but thread Ripper is a larger CPU it has
four rise and dies in there so making a
block that's specifically designed for
that tends to work a little bit better
so to that end I have an ek X 399 gaming
RGB mono block so this is a mono block
for the full motherboard it's gonna also
cover the V RMS and keep those cooler so
I'll be integrating this as well the
last thing I wanted to point out before
I get into this is that this was kind of
what the system was designed for this is
a water cooled system water cooled
systems especially custom articled
systems are notorious for being
difficult to work with
and upgrade my well with this system
which I did by including quick
disconnects wherever I could was to make
sure that the water cooling loop could
be disassembled and pull out of there
and even if I wanted to do something as
crazy as swapping the motherboard out or
adding a mono block I could do that
hopefully without too much trouble and
today's video is probably either going
to be a proof of that concept or a proof
that's no matter what you do with a
custom articled system like this it's
going to be a challenge either way so
when it comes to taking apart my loop I
think I've decided how I want to go
about doing this so click this connect
so pretty much everywhere there is a
connection point so from here to here
there's a quick disconnect there down
here there's one there one here and up
here and so on so I think I can leave my
radiators in place and leave them full
of liquid to by just using the quick
disconnects for that to remove the parts
down here and then I'll see if I'm going
to need to drain I probably will drain
these separately after I get those
pieces pulled out
so sparked these reservoirs cuz I had
noticed and Joe also noticed there's a
few spots on them that had appeared
since they're all white I was rubbing on
those to see if that would come off and
it seems like it does
there's also though it seems like maybe
some rough spots on these these little
things here and there
so as I'm feeling them some of the rough
patches seem like they might be a little
bit more inclined to pick up residue
like the right here actually is a good
example that there is some buildup and
that appears to be like the plastic
itself is kind of rough right here so I
think that's why that buildup occurred
this is the pieces of one of the
original cold cathodes it goes in the
center of these and lights it up I
haven't had these installed because I
broke one of them when I did the initial
installation broke another one of them
just now they are quite delicate I think
and concerned me too bad because
fortunately alpha coal did send me some
replacements for these after I broke
that first one so hopefully I can use
this drop it back down in there and
these aren't supposed to just be for
lighting though since it's also UV it's
also supposed to potentially kill any
biological growth in the liquid too so
this might actually potentially help
from getting buildup on my little
helixes so now that I've done this once
I think I can present you with the
master class on how to replace a cold
cathode in one of these alpha cool helix
reservoirs drops down in there just like
that but bear in mind if you're placing
one you will need to retrieve little
nubby that came with the original
because the replacement doesn't come
with that just gonna feed this on the
end bear mine there's a little extra
wire the
goes down the entire length of the
cathode tube you do not want to break
that it is delicate so be careful now we
have our cap caps in two pieces is
actually a center unit there and there's
an o-ring just beneath that so make sure
both of those are in place take your
helix of course and drop it down in the
center then we can take this cap put it
back on top push it down a little bit it
will cause the outer sleeve to catch on
the threading on the reservoir itself
and then by screwing that down it will
actually sink these up push that a ring
into place get yourself a nice water
seal there I do need to rotate this so
we'll line up where I want it to be in
the actual build I'm just gonna tighten
that down good and tight take my cathode
drop it down the middle and then just
using a little dowel to kind of push
that into place haha as I'm working on
this upgrade I have another box arrived
and it is also from AMD and I have no
idea what it is because usually I
responds to AMD and say yes send this
over or that over or whatever they want
to send but I've just I just have it
this time purely because I've been so
busy this past week but they're sending
me stuff anyway so you guys get to find
out what it is along with me hey there
it is that was a large box for a single
processor well there it is this is the
29 20 X I have no immediate use for this
but thank you Andy for sending this over
this is the 12 core version so this is
the lowest end processor you can get
when it comes to threader / - that's all
I really have to say about it for now
let's let's move on
things are actually moving along pretty
steadily now and the thing I was most
happy with was the removal of the
motherboard I don't know if you guys saw
that in the time-lapse but just taking
the graphics cards out all as one units
removing this whole pump and reservoir
assembly allowed me to easily get at the
motherboard pull that out of there get
the block installed plugging back in
reinstall it I also really like that the
dim dot 2 slot that's available on the
motherboard just allows you to take the
MDOT 2 drives put them in that little
adapter and and slot it right in it's an
a very convenient place up here and it's
not blocked by any of these graphics
cards down here so that's cool too
beyond that I wanted to give a test of
my newly assembled pump reservoir combos
here so if we assembled that looped it
in with itself and then this is actually
an AC adapter that was sent by a fan -
awesome hardware to our p.o box actually
sent to Kyle's Pio box just a lacy
adapter with a molex plug and a button
so that allows me to really easily test
these pumps turn them on enough and
fortunately we have no leaks appearing
thus far so I think I'm really quickly
going to test those cold cathodes as
well and then we'll drop this back into
oh thanks Joe
sorry after all my warnings I completely
I'm gonna need to air-dry it so now
because that happens I cannot do a test
food I just had a major brain fart again
just flaky water everywhere so all that
was left one last little piece to
connect from the monoblock up to here
the model block is positioned a little
bit differently when it comes to my
connectors there so that's trying to get
the tubing lengths to be the right
length to look okay and everything I had
it like functional in there but I was
trying to cut this a little shorter and
then I wanted to measure the length of
this and get an idea of how short it be
to go from here to here and I forgot
that the top radiator is completely full
of liquid still so when I connected the
connector it started to drain out and
now we have some liquid back there
between the graphics cards and the
motherboard so I would need to pull
these GPUs out dry it off as much as I
can let it sit at least overnight
depending on how much water is back
there and I'm gonna have to come back to
you guys in just a minute it'll be just
a minute for you guys but it'll be
tomorrow for me and actually get
hopefully a test boot on this thing ah
that was so stupid I was warning joe
about that happening earlier and then I
completely blanked on it potentially
happening just now ah that's right all
right pulling the graphics cards Beckett
it has transition all right guys it's
now two days from the last shot where I
tragically spilled water inside here and
I've just been waiting for stuff to dry
out I think everything is good to go now
graphics cards there have had plenty of
time and internally now I just have a
couple things really left to do I'm
gonna use some barrel extenders here to
provide a little bit of extension for
the monoblock
to give me a little bit more flexibility
with where these tubes are going need to
apparently this one hasn't tried out
completely I need to cut this one a
little bit shorter in order to make that
a little bit smoother up there honestly
I'm just so close to being done
and then of course the last thing is
gonna be some wiring up in the back
hooking up my little UV cold cathodes in
there and then of course getting the
SSDs all wired and then should be
finished and fire this up and make sure
everything is hopefully still working
that said though I have plenty of paper
towels here so I'm going to once again
get into the risky phase of trying to
work with these tubes and
hopefully not lose too much fluid along
the way
alright guys the system has been
reassembled I was about to power it all
on and then I realized you know it
always be safe rather than be sorry so
let's do some pump testing and see if we
can figure out if there are any leaks
going on also I will probably need to be
topping off these pumps as they're
filling with air pretty quickly does
seem to have enough fluid in it so
that's good for now all right I'm gonna
leave this running for just a minute or
two top it off
then I'll cycle through check the second
one - alright CPU loop is looking good
so I'm gonna switch over and tried the
GPU loop he goes to the GPU loop yeah we
have they could flow this one doesn't
have as much air to work out a loop
either because didn't drain these front
rads very much alright so again just
gonna let this run for a few minutes
double check for leaks and then I can do
a repower back on and hopefully
everything I install this functional
alright guys I think it is about time to
do an actual test boot on the system
upgraded all the new parts integrated
looks like we got power
I sure hope I rewired the power button
up properly I sure hope there are no
leaks
I sure hope I'll shoot I don't think the
power button is wired up properly I'll
shoot that's inconvenient alright I'll
have to worry about that later
for now we use the surface mounted power
button this is promising initially both
pumps working yeah look at that
excellent progress beautiful this your
pretty common just swapped the CPU
message new CPU installed and oh it's
also giving me a fan speed area because
nothing's plugged in to the fan header
processors recognize 29 70 WX 24 core
processor when it comes to onboard
devices under SATA configuration I can
see both of my course airforce le 480
gig SSDs as well as the two SanDisk 2
terabyte so that's good too and finally
here under boot devices I can see my two
samsung 970 evos also being recognized
that is fantastic alright guys that is
gonna pretty much wrap it up for this
video I have the system back up and
running
I don't appear to have any
fingers crossed on that of course I'm
gonna keep a close eye on it for the
time being and I have rebooted into
Windows and the IQ software is loaded
back up I still need to synchronize the
Asus software with the Corsair software
to get all the colors matching but
functionally everything's working and I
would say that given all of the stuff
that I did in this video to this system
including swapping in a CPU swapping in
a water cooling monoblock swapping out a
busted pump adding in the SSD storage
that I did and the fact that this is a
very complex system with lots of moving
parts in it I don't think it was all
that difficult
relatively speaking of course let me
know what you guys think if you think
it's worth it to build a system like
this with all the complexity involved I
of course will be following up with more
because I need to build a computer off
floor stand for this to go on in the
computer room and then of course I am
planning on using this system still so I
do plan to follow up once I get it's
integrated into my workflow and into my
computer room and show you guys some of
the performance especially with the
upgraded CPU kind of curious how that's
gonna work especially when it comes to
gaming but that's gonna wrap it up for
this video guys I really hope you enjoy
it the thumbs up button if you did I'll
put links to as much of this stuff as
possible in the description down below
and while you're down there consider
subscribing too so you can see my follow
up videos on this as well as lots of
other videos coming at you real soon
thanks again for watching guys and we'll
see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
