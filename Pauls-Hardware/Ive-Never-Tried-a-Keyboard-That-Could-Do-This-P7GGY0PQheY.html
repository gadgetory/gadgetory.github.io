unboxed a bunch of Coolermaster stuff
and everyone was like what's that
mysterious product that you had to
redact and remove from that video now
bit of explanation that was my fault
coolermaster sent me all this stuff and
various things had various different
embargo dates the embargo for most of
this stuff was last week so that's why I
posted that video then but the embargo
for this that we're talking about today
which is cooler masters new flagship MK
850 keyboard is today or about today
whenever this video goes up so since
this is the new flagship I thought I'd
do it a solid and do a bit more in-depth
coverage just on this keyboard by itself
and also to give you guys some sort of
explanation as to what that blurred-out
product was it was this the MK 850
featuring aim pad technology with analog
keys G skills new Triton C Royal Series
ddr4 RGB memory kits are made for high
class pcs with each meticulously crafted
module featuring a full-length
crystalline light bar atop a polished
heat spreader with a luxuriant
reflective gold or silver finish
reminding you to appreciate the finer
things in life
like the freedom to choose from trade NZ
royal RGB kits in 16 gig 228 gig
capacities and up to ddr4 40 600
megahertz memory speeds if you're
looking to give your high class system
built the Royal Treatment clip the
sponsor link in the description below so
I actually already unbox this when I
unbox all the other cooler master stuff
last week so I'm an impossibly mix in
some of that footage along with this so
you can see the christina unboxing
experience i reboxed it so I can unbox
it again so it goes inside the box
though we have a bit of a instruction
guide for how to use this keyboard it
never use the keyboard before we have
the keyboard itself which has some
plastic protective covering on it this
does have a new design all new unique
design compared to the Mk 750 if you're
looking at the previous flagship
keyboard from Coolermaster although it
does have a completely metal top with
brushed aluminum and then some sort of
texture along the edge which i think is
a nice look beneath that we have a
plastic for the base you've got a
routing channel in the bottom so you can
take your USB type-c cable plug it in
right there and you can route it
straight back or off to the side left or
right depending on your preference you
do have some feedback here so you can
lift up the keyboard and give yourself
some decline as you're typing which is
more comfortable
lots of people and includes a magnetic
wrist rest as well and then a feature
that stood out to me immediately which
isn't going to be included on all the
keyboards Coolermaster did this for me
cuz I'm special is we have a Paul's
hardware key cap with my pulse hardware
at thumb screw logo on it which i think
is very special normally you would get a
coolermaster logo key cap right there
which they have still included in the
box for me but wanted to point that out
and say thanks blur master for
customizing my little sample here here's
the standard cool and master key cap
then beyond that we have a complete new
set of keys well not completely a set of
keys but new keys for the cue wer and
asdf keys here which are the analog
enabled impact technology keys all the
rest of the keys use Cherry MX switches
there's a key cap puller in there as
well and then we also have some purple
key caps that you can put on your left
right up and down keys here as well as
the five macro keys which are over here
on the left side other notable stats
about this keyboard is the use of Cherry
MX switches of course key switches
they're chained MX Reds for this one the
manual seems to indicate that there
might be other Cherry MX which is
available but I think at lunch they're
just going with red construction
materials are plastic aluminum and PU
leather which is a faux leather that's
used in the wrist rest the color is
gunmetal black these are RGB key caps so
16.7 million colors the keyboard has a
pulling rate of one thousand Hertz and a
response rate of one millisecond or 1000
Hertz there's an onboard 32-bit ARM
Cortex m3 processor as well as 512
kilobytes of built-in memory so that you
can take your multimedia keys or your
color keys or whatever program the board
with your settings and then take it with
you and not necessarily need to have
these software installed I am going to
be testing out the software which is
currently being called portal version
one point five point four is what's
available and that'll hopefully give you
guys a better idea of how to control
this keyboard and some of the other
various functions it has for example at
the top we have a set of media control
keys here for play pause forward back
mutes and controlling brightness we also
have two volume rollers right up here at
the top one I've already confirmed works
just for volume by default the other you
can program to do whatever you want it
to do for instance you can use it to
cycle through RGB controls you can use
it to control the volume on just your
headset versus one controlling the
system sound for example or you can just
set it up to replace your Mouse's scroll
wheel function and I imagine there's
other stuff you can do with it as well
there's a only a single USB type-c plug
to plug this in but
there is a built-in USB 3.0 hub so you
get two USB 3.0 pass through ports right
there
I can't vouch for the speed that you get
through those since it is working
through a hub but nice that they are 3.0
finally you have three keys up here on
the top right and that is for the aim
pad technology you can turn the aim pad
on or off or you can adjust the level
where it actually starts to detect you
pressing down the aim pad keys so if you
want to adjust that so that the text
you're typing a bit on the same level at
the Cherry MX which is you can do that
and with dedicated buttons right there
so here's the glue Master portal
software looks like a pretty easy to
understand layout it starts with aimed
pad on the left and here's where you can
actually control your aim pad functions
there are three aim pad profiles M 2 M 3
and M 4 so you can switch between them
and then that will change the function
of your aim pad keys so for example and
the default profile we have the ASD and
W keys that are matching up with the
left analog stick and a joypad so
they're going to imitate the left analog
joypad sticks functions if we go down to
M 4 they have also assigned the Q and E
keys here to the left trigger and right
trigger on there and then you can see
there's available keys that you can also
program in if you wanted to set up
something for the RF for example to be
like one of the other analog keys on the
joypad here you can also adjust the
sensitivity of those aim pad analog
switches and that pretty much is all for
that
moving on to lighting we can that
actually see a bunch of different
lighting presets since the preset that
it has right now is snowing which I kind
of like actually they have a bunch that
are pretty easy to use here
rain for example shows some nice rain
falling down there I jumped back to
profile and one here so that the aim pad
keys are no longer lit up so here and
lighting we can see rainfall so there's
rain we also have of course your default
rainbow wave that lots of people have
used before crosshair allows you to type
and that will sort of do a crosshair
vertically and horizontally with
whatever key that you type on the
keyboard reactive fade fades out each
key as you type it so it's got a blue
background and then when I type its the
foreground in white as you can see
listed and foreground there then it
fades off as you type of course you have
a custom mode here where you can
individually select any keys that you
wants in chain
their color we have a star field which
is just you know nice shiny starry field
color cycle will cycle between colors
breathing will will do breathing also
can do multiple colors or custom colors
if you want ripple will do a ripple from
wherever you type out to the edge and
again you can speed that up and slow it
down if you want to so fun to go slow we
have a slower ripple with this one you
can actually play snake on the keyboard
Coolermaster actually has a bunch of
these built into their keyboards so move
your snake up or down eat the green
apple and then your snake will become
longer and then you can eat the other
Apple it's it's kind of interesting and
if you're really bored and all you have
is a keyboard it's a functional mobile
game to play no Apple again I thought
fire ball is kind of fun wherever you
type it doesn't shoot sapphire ball
across the keyboard so if you type on
the left side of the keyboard it should
set off that way you type on the right
side it should spire ball off that way
it's a good question Joe's wondering if
we can if the fireballs will explode in
the middle now they crowd they cross
over each other they're not affected you
can do dual fireballs though water
ripple will ripple out from wherever you
punch a key so that'll make it very
dancey reactive punch just does a big
block of keys that light up wherever you
type I already showed snowing at the
beginning which is similar to rain but
it kind of flutters the snowflakes down
over the keyboard there's a heartbeat
function which heartbeat oh oh I see it
does like an EKG kind of peaks and drops
back then circle spectrum is another RGB
vomit option which is just gonna do a
sort of a gradient this way reactive
tornado sounds exciting what's what it's
doing it's a tornado of RGB that's
reacting as I type and then down here we
have multi layer and multi zone options
so you can actually pile up multiple
effects on top of each other that's
gonna get pretty crazy pretty quickly so
I'll just show that that's available and
then of course you can turn off the LEDs
that's convenient other functions in the
software are key mapping of course so
you can you know tell any key to be a
different key or disable that key if you
want to that is how you will actually
adjust your real your scroll wheels that
are up there at the top because you do
have a deep
function with the scroll wheel which is
volume so the one on the right here just
gonna do volume by default so if you
wanted to reassign the left scroll wheel
here to do something else you could do
it here it looks like currently have
access to macros letters and numbers
navigation keys modifier or spacing keys
such as inter backspace space left
control right control numpad keys media
keys punctuation keys and miscellaneous
keys and of course you could reassign
any of these keys to do anything if you
wanted to really confuse somebody who's
trying to use your keyboard and wants to
type something next up is the macro
function you can create a macro over
here I just created a macro to
automatically input the Konami code as
you can see it records delays and how
long you've pressed each button and you
can have quite a bit of functions with
each macro of course loop functions are
available too and then you can quickly
assign the macros to different keys over
here by pressing the different key to
assign macro to that's which I'm not
going to do right now lastly we have
profiles big buttons here to reset
rename import/export or open each one
individually so this will change the
entire keyboards profile layouts you can
support up to four of them that will
allow you to also change all of your
macro settings and your aim pad
functions and your gamepad profiles over
there on the left hand side as well so
fast-forwarding a bit I decided to spend
a couple days with this keyboard just
testing it out and sort of taking it
through the motions seeing how it works
first off as a keyboard it is a
perfectly functional and good keyboard
uses genuine Cherry MX keys so if you
like cherry MX Reds and you like a full
size layout keyboard with a number-pad
down here you're not gonna have too much
to complain about we have easily
accessible media keys across the top
here we have the full layout which is
easy for typing the wrist rest does come
off a little bit easily if you're moving
around a keyboard a lot but for the most
part it stays stuck on there and it's
comfy as well then we've got some nice
macro keys across the side and the
software's been pretty functional for me
as well it's done everything I've asked
it to do the only thing I haven't spent
too much time on is the macro keys but I
have been testing out superhot because
if you're gonna spend 200 bucks on this
keyboard and that is the MSRP one $99.99
from coolermaster you might be
considering to yourself what more is
this offering me and of course the
analogue keys are going to be the big
difference maker compared to other
keyboards in the same realm I should
point out that coolermaster isn't the
first company to integrate analog keys
into a full keyboard like this routing
has the winning one and winning two that
have similar technology but
difference here is that these analog
keys have four millimeters of travel and
it senses the analog depression or how
far you've pressed the key down across
that entire range whereas the wounding
keyboards only do to two millimeters so
that's gonna be a matter of preference
for you as for actually using the keys
and playing a game with them I have two
demos that I'm gonna run through one is
super hot that I've been playing a
little bit of right now and actually
haven't played this game too much but it
is a great example for this particular
keyboard because in superhot as you play
the time only moves forward as you move
so if you want to move time just a
little bit and give yourself a strategic
advantage you can push the key down just
a little and move just little and it
will only advance time just a little and
that is pretty useful so I'm gonna go up
here and punch that guy and punch him
again and then punch him again and I
don't know there's a guy behind me with
bats and now I've been beaten dead
alright so haven't tried this level
before so that's been some part of the
reason maybe I should go for the guy
with the bat first
haha I did it so the whole point there
is that it's very helpful to be able to
make small movements in the game for
strategy purposes and so you can beat
people up and shoot them but the
controls in this game are also very
simple you're on foot you're just using
WASD to move and you have a couple other
function keys I also tried the keyboard
as Grand Theft Auto and that was a
slightly different experience so the top
right here you have the aim pad button
that will enable or disable aim pad mode
for your analog controllable buttons
over here and you might notice when I
push that button that the screen
actually goes off and it says there's no
keyboard connected and that's actually
disconnecting and reconnecting the
keyboard every time I do that more on
that just a second but with aim pad on
mode it lights up the keys that have
analog control there and then over here
an imp ad I can actually go between
different profiles M 2 and M 3 and M 4
our by defaults the aim pad profiles and
it has different keys assigned to each
one and when you're turning pad mode on
what it's actually doing as far as
Windows is concern is emulating a
controller that's plugged in so it's
saying your left analog stick up down
left and right is assigned to the W a s
and D keys right there for up down left
and right if I switch to M 2 mode it
switches so that right trigger and left
trigger the analog triggers at the top
of an Xbox 360 remote are now assigned
to forward and back and that's going to
be key for a game like grand theft auto
the third preset here does w a s and D
for the up-down left-right on the analog
stick here as well as left trigger and
right trigger for the Q and the e button
so you can actually have access to all
of those functions at the same time but
in order to get this to work properly
and play nice with Windows and easily be
accessed by the games that you're
playing it again is emulating and
pretending that is a controller so when
you plug in this keyboard it thinks it
is controller 1 of an Xbox controller
that you've plugged in to your computer
for example I just plugged my xbox 360
controller in here and it is now
assigned to player 2 because it thinks
that player 1 Xbox 360 controller is the
keyboard that's plugged in now a
situation that can occur here and that I
actually encountered when I first tried
to play GTA 5 is that if you press this
button to switch analog control mode on
or off it's going to rear Ekka guys the
keyboard and it occasionally Ari
recognizes the keyboard as player 2 or
player 3 and if the game that you're
playing can immediately recognize
different controllers plugged into the
same
system then you're not gonna have access
to the controls on the keyboard so case
in point here I plugged in the
controller it assigned it to controller
two I turn the keyboard off and then
back on and I unplugged and replug the
controller and now the controller is now
player one once again
so I've loaded up GTA 5 and here's what
happens if I turn on the analog amp ed
mode with the controller already plugged
in nothing and for my understanding the
reason that's happening is because the
since I've reconnected at the computer
it's recognizing the keyboard as
controller to a controller 3 and GTA 5
by default can't access those
controllers at least not with any of the
means I've tried out so just trying to
fix this and work around it I unplugged
the controller reconnected the keyboard
hoping that I would get controller 1
again but it doesn't seem to have worked
I can't still move around a non analog
mode so I unplugged and replug the
keyboard in order to try to switch it
back and get the analog controls working
because I just want to show that because
I was able to get them working and now
it's got like I'm walking forward
without anything happening I think I'm
gonna need to restart the game here so I
restarted GTA 5 unfortunately my analog
keys are now working once again in GTA 5
if you're running around or on foots
there is no analog control it's just
your going or your knots it's in the car
that you actually would want to have
that control and of course it started me
up on top of some train tracks here with
Trevor so I have no cars readily
available let me find one so I'm
actually kind of glad I chose GTA 5
because it is my best example of a game
where I feel like I would actually make
use of analog controls but it's also a
game that when I usually play it I have
a controller plugged in that I use so if
I'm on foot and I need to run around and
aiming at things I use the keyboard a
mouse so I can aim more accurately and
then when I'm in a car
I grab the controller so I can have the
analog controls for steering because
that's what I'm much more used to and
comfortable with now here since I've
jumped into the car I try to afford him
back and actually can't because forward
and back are still just forward and back
and the controller controls are forward
and back would use the triggers up here
there's two ways to deal with that in
the game one is to go into the games
control functions and actually reassign
them so that forward and back would
still be the W and s keys or you can
just use the macros over here since m2
and m3 switch between those and now I
can do forward and back
with analog control there since it's
reassign that I was playing this for a
little while yesterday and I was
actually training myself to hit m2 or m3
to switch back and forth between those
modes when I was jumping into a car out
of it but I think if I was playing this
long term I would just go into the game
and reassign those buttons so I didn't
have to switch between my two presets
what's wrong
wrong with this person I missed his
system I'm shooting so see I got out of
the car and immediately started shooting
by pressing W because it switched it to
the trigger button what's wrong with
this person
yeah just no one's no one's helping this
person it's up to Trevor where my car go
that's right hey tali Ana Martinez I
helped her out and now she can be a
driver in my missions all right I'm
getting distracted by playing the actual
game
I think the analog controls are helpful
there and it's definitely a lot easier
to steer and move around so while
playing GTA 5 and I can definitely say
it would allow me to get rid of the
controller if that's what I was looking
for the best example I can show you if
it actually in action is just the wheels
as they turn I slowly press down the a
to turn left and you can see the wheel
turn a little bit or turn more that's
really all there is to it I can get a
little bit of action in between there as
well so to kind of sum things up here I
think the analog keys on this keyboard
are functional and useful when you can
get them working properly in the right
environment my plan was to play it with
the GTA v and just because that's one of
the games that I play most often that I
feel like I would actually use this in
but it does take away the experience if
you are planning to do something like
switch between a controller and the
keyboard itself you're really going to
want to go with one or the other and
that's just because of some of the
conflicts that are introduced by the
windows automatic recognition of
something like an Xbox 360 controller
automatically assigning it to a position
and then the software syncing up with
that so it will actually function and
the game that you play and functions
seamlessly but I think with a game like
GTA 5 would just take a little bit more
setup work to get all the keys assigned
properly so I could completely rely on
the keyboard and take the controller out
of the situation completely of course
there's a bunch of other games that
would take advantage of this technology
as well so you know pick your poison but
keep in mind that if it's a game that
you typically use a controller in or if
you want to have that flexibility of
having a controller and the keyboard you
might be dealing with some restarts or
some unplugging and re-plugging stuff in
to get it to work right I'm hoping that
coolermaster can maybe update the
software to allow you to manually assign
what is recognized as
troller one a controller - when it comes
to the analog controllers you have
plugged in ultimately though I think if
you wanted the analog keys the aim pad
technology but not to have the confusion
of whether or not the keyboard is being
recognized as a controller maybe just
hold out for the actual aim pad that
coolermaster is also developing which
will be separate and has an entire
keypad full of analog controllable and
assignable keys but guys that's gonna
wrap it up for this video I hope you've
enjoyed it and let me know what you
think of the cooler master master keys
850 down in the comment section below do
you think this keyboards worth 200 bucks
let me know and I'll put a link to it
when available in the description -
thanks again for watching hit the thumbs
up button on your way up and we'll see
you guys next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
