probably can't see too well behind me
cuz it's in soft-focus but the garage
has gotten very dirty over the past year
it is the end of November beginning of
December right now 2018 is winding down
and I think it's a great time to do some
cleaning some organizing instead of
preparing so we can start 2019 off on
the right foot start fresh so we can be
efficient and get lots of work done so I
am going to do a garage work log today
where I clean stuff and I'm gonna do
some hopefully satisfying time lapses a
lot of stuff getting put away at its
proper place but I think I might need
some help some assistance for this task
maybe maybe even from somebody with a
themed hat a helper themed hat might be
good I don't know how many ways I need
to ask him to step into the shot hey
that's it look how convenient its helper
Joe elf here to help me clean you bit
tall for an elf Joe we have three goals
today one clean and organized to break
for sushi three maybe some Christmas
decorations I like Christmas
so does Joe obviously right dogs aren't
helping at all
but we've made a lot of progress haven't
we Joe yes Joe's doing today don't a lot
of clearing out of stuff over here we've
only been working for about a hour maybe
an hour and a half I got the test bed
set up over there so I can have a little
bit more space on the desk stuff over
there so I can set up a Christmas tree
and then we've been separating the boxes
that actually have like good useful
hardware in them which is all this stuff
from stuff that beginner cycle just
wanted to do an update everything is
going swimmingly
swimmingly swimmingly right okay
we're taking a lunch break Scouts here
now have you come to help me clean my
garage that's the idea yeah okay cool
that's good
anytime in there's the radium
technologies does is very good at
keeping things clean that's the idea
unorganized filter but let's have sushi
first
that's not bad yes sorted sushi this is
a lunch special it's not the same thing
that was good okay back to work finished
lunch never shopping Joe earlier was
talking trash on the mr. coffee trashcan
talking trash get it so we are going to
upgrade to a new one this looks nice
do you think of this stainless steel
these are super expensive look this is a
six $65 trash can that's way more than
the mr. coffee box that I've been using
for the past three years
seems a little a little small here we go
three foot tree comes with lights pre
lit I mean it's not our GB but I've
already got too much of that car hold on
hold on we have an RGB tree we do that's
not a Chesil
so torn what do you guys think do you do
you prefer this de fixed all white
lights or do you like the RGB lights I
don't like anything that twinkles I will
tell you that no one sucks it's
twinkling greet you I don't like
twinkling solid fixed lights right Joe
keep things classy shopping success Joe
got a Reese's peanut butter cups oh yeah
they got the pivot lid trash can
Christmas tree of course and then we
live with these lights through the
background documents a new trash can
just chopping it peels off oh good yeah
I hate when it uses crappy adhesives
where do I put the trash Oh
lid on disclosure anyone be cool good
job Joe so much progress oh my god
Joe's dusting I didn't ask Joe to desk
just to be clear here Joe is not forced
to dust he's doing it of his own
volition
Joe play the ukulele
I love ac/dc beautiful the elf hat
really added a lot of festive lots to
play they got it it's a easy deal up for
us and visually their helpers I need to
say anything
perfect I don't have antlers says paws
has a fuzzy fuzzy as a fuzzy antlers a
perfect and majus it's better all right
we're gonna do the lighting of the tree
but she's actually looking quite nice I
think we've integrated some of our RGB
lights in with the white ones then I
have the idea to use a star which is
actually our scrap yard were season 5
loser trophy even though we actually won
technically and then Joe dismounted it
and put it up there so even got a star
on top of the tree look how beautiful
that is
Merry Christmas everyone you know
started filming for a while you always
told me to keep this app up like frame
good night was a film it I was kind of
embarrassed at my mr. coffee trashcan
but it's been my trashcan for like
several years now so I thought we should
say good bye bye mr. coffee trashcan
thank you being a trashcan this one
looks a lot nicer though hey Joe I think
we have done a great job actually you
did most of the work so thank you I
appreciate that table is clear we can
see the gamers Nexus mod Matt I have a
few things that are still out here I
want to do an upgrade to this table and
add some pockets on the side and stuff
forever
thing but other than that new trash can
yay and we got our Christmas decorations
up and running
I have also set up arctic Panther to be
a little bit more of a Christmas theme I
transitioned from fall now to winter we
got weights with the lights and
everything else so everything is
beautiful and very festive and that it's
gonna wrap it up for this garage worklog

feeling much more positive about to the
next few weeks and months working in an
