what's up guys welcome back to Pauls
hardware and this my long-awaited rise
in 5 overclocking video now if you
purchase a rise in CPU from AMD you
should be excited about it because it's
new architecture they're very fast
they're very good price to performance
ratios especially if you compare them to
what intel currently has but also all of
the rise in processes whether you talk
and rise in 5 or rise in 7 or even the
rise in threes that we don't actually
know much about yet are all unlocked
which means you can overclock them and
whereas you might not be familiar with
overclocking or comfortable with it this
video is going to teach you how to do it
I'm going to show you exactly the
settings that I use for a couple basic
overclocks myself I'll give you a couple
of tips for overclocking beyond that if
you want to get into it and then I'll
give you some closing thoughts on what I
think the best bang for the buck is when
it comes to these rising v processors
that are available but you could for
instance take something that's less
expensive like the Rison v 1400 which
you can get for about a hundred and
seventy bucks overclock it and then get
the performance more in line with what
you would get with the risin v 1500 X
which costs about $190 now there are
other things to take into consideration
like whether or not you get a cooler
with your rising v processor you do not
for instance get a cooler with the risin
v 1600 X the top-of-the-line rise in v
processor that has six cores and twelve
threads you do get a cooler this is the
rape stealth for example with the risin
v 1400 and then you will get the Wraith
spire which is a little bit larger this
is a 95 watt TDP cooler versus a 65 watt
TDP and this one will come with the 1500
X and the 1600 so buying those
processors will mean that you don't have
to spend an extra 30 40 50 bucks on an
aftermarket cooler
although aftermarket coolers will
perform a bit better than the race
stealth and race fire and you might be
able to get a little bit better
overclocking out of them you can
overclock with these coolers you just
might not be able to achieve quite as
high of a frequency and you might
running a little bit higher temperature
so I have all four risin five CPUs here
the 1400 1500 X 1600 and 1600 X and
since the UI is different for each
vendor I have motherboards from the top
three manufacturers specifically from
Asus the prime V 350 plus and crosshair
six hero X 370 from MSI the X 370 X
power gaming titanium and from gigabyte
the a be 350 gaming three I highly
recommend updating your motherboards
UEFI so you have access to the latest
Ram compatibility updates you can
download that from your motherboard
support page on the manufacturers
website as for software
aside from Windows 10 I'll be using CPU
Z and hardware monitor to verify that
the overclock is enabled and to monitor
temperatures remember that right now the
2x CPUs the 1500 X and 1600 X will
report 20 degrees higher temperatures in
the operating system so just bear that
in mind and I also have Cinebench r15 to
test performance improvements and the
i-264 stress test for stress testing
before you overclock
definitely run Cinebench at least once
to get a baseline score to compare
against
and now let's overclock the four main
parameters that you're going to want to
change when overclocking our CPU
frequency CPU voltage memory frequency
and memory voltage you should be able to
adjust all of these settings in the UEFI
bios of any decent V 350 or X 370
motherboard and then after you change
the settings hit f10 to save and exit
boot into Windows load up CPU Z and
hardware monitor and then run Cinebench
if you get through it without crashing
you can then run Ida's 64 s stress test
for a few minutes before going back to
tweak settings more to really test
ability you should run the stress test
for a few hours or overnight once you've
settled on your overclock now let's go
over the specific settings you should be
using for CPU frequency you should be
able to overclock your Rison 5 CPU to
between 3.8 and 4.1 gigahertz when
overclocked your CPU will run all of its
cores at this frequency as opposed to
the out-of-the-box turbo speeds that
you'll see listed on the box that only
overclocks
two cores at a time frequency is
determined by a multiplier that's a
number that you will set times 100
megahertz which is the system's base
clock so for a 3.9 gigahertz we
set the multiplier to 39 / 4 gigahertz
it would be 40 and so on that's really
all there is to it on some motherboards
you can adjust the base clock to that
we'll save that for an upcoming part 2
video ASUS motherboards will call the
multiplier cpu core ratio gigabyte
motherboards call it cpu clock ratio and
MSI just called it CPU frequency to run
your CPU cores at a higher frequency
you're probably going to need to add
more voltage now if you can get away
with leading the voltage set to auto or
even lowering it that is good because
higher voltage will produce more heat
every CPU will be a little different
though when it comes to how much voltage
is needed to overclock you can set the
core voltage on a rise in CPU to between
1.3 and 1 point 4 volts safely and AMD
actually says you can go up to 1 point 4
to 5 but you shouldn't go beyond that I
personally stick to one point 4 or below
for a long-term overclock core voltage
can sometimes just be punched in
manually like here in MSI's UEFI under
CPU core voltage and then sometimes
you'll have an offset option like with
gigabytes dynamic v core here you can
tell us to run at a certain number of
millivolts higher or lower than it would
normally some boards like the Asus
crosshair 6 hero will let you do a
manual or offset voltage a common
technique is to start with a higher
voltage manually set it to 1 point 4 or
use an offset setting of plus point 1 5
or maybe point 2 in order to see how
high you can get to CPU frequency then
slowly start to back up the voltage a
bit at a time until you experience
instability in your stress test with the
CPU overclock let's move on to memory
there are two ways to overclock memory
the first is to tell your motherboard to
read the overclock settings from the
memory itself these are usually called
XMP settings but since XMP is
technically an Intel thing MSI has
called this a XMP there might be one or
a few profiles that you can try with
slightly different settings Asus called
this vo CP for some inexplicable reason
I think that stands for dammit overclock
please and you give I decided that they
didn't really care so they just went
ahead and still called it XMP since
Verizon can be finicky with some memory
modules though these XMP settings won't
always work so your second option is to
manually
set the frequency under DRAM frequency
or memory frequency as UEFI updates come
out there will be more options in this
drop-down but right now it goes up to
ddr4 3200 choose a speed that is at or
below what your memory is rated for my
Corsair ddr4 3000 kit for example I got
to run at 29 33 and that works with
pretty much all the rise inside CPUs
that I've tried if you want to go a step
further here you can go into advanced
DRAM configuration and plug in the
timings that are listed on the sticker
on the side of your memory usually it's
something like 16 16 16 39 finally you
will definitely want to increase your
memory voltage if you want to hit a
higher memory frequency MSI lists this
as DRAM voltage the default is 1.2 for
ddr4 but you can set it to 1.3 5 almost
always without any problems and he
actually says you can go as high as 1.5
volts but I usually stick to 1.35 now
whenever you punch in new settings and
reset there is a good chance that your
motherboard will cycle on and off a few
times this is normal and usually if it
drives 5 times or so and it can't boot
it will prompt you with a message tell
you that the overclock failed and it'll
direct you to go back into the BIOS that
is part of the process and usually it
just means that you should try a little
bit more voltage or perhaps a bit lower
frequency once you've settled in on an
overclock I definitely recommend saving
it to a profile in the UEFI if your
motherboard has that option and all the
motherboards I've used today do have
that and finally of course run an
overnight stress test with i-264
so by adjusting those 4 settings CPU
frequency CPU voltage memory frequency
and memory voltage I am very confident
that even with a stock Wraith cooler
most of you guys can hit 3.8 or 3.9
gigahertz across all cores of your
ride's in the CPU some of you with lucky
chips will be able to even hit 4 or 4.1
gigahertz if you get a chip that
overclocks better but is there more to
overclocking than just these basic steps
I think maybe you can get even just a
bit more out of your CPU with some
slightly more advanced overclocking
techniques and I'll be covering those in
a follow-up video coming very soon so
guys that wraps it up for my
overclocking guide with Rison 5 if you
want my opinion on which of these rising
5 CPUs is the best one to go with I like
the r5 1600 you get six cores and twelve
threads you get a nine
five watt cooler that comes in the box
it cost a good 20 or 30 bucks less than
the 1600 x does and you're not hampered
by having less l3 cache or anything like
that
now the r5 1400 I think is an
interesting option it is the cheapest
out of these bunch however you do get
half as much l3 cache you get 8 Meg's
instead of 16 Meg's you don't get a 95
watt cooler you get the 65 watt cooler
and it runs about 300 megahertz slower
out of the box than the r5 1500 X so I
would opt for the 1500 X for 20 bucks
more if you have that option or if it's
within the budget but if you're really
really tight get in the 1400 isn't a bad
idea because you do have that upgrade
pass and down the line if the 1400 isn't
pull isn't pulling its weight if you
need more than four cores you can
upgrade to a six core rise in five or
even an eight core rise in seven a
little bit down the line anyway guys

bit about how to overclock right inside
