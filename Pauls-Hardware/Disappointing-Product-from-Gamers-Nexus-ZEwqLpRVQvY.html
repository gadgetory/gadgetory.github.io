manufacturer of several interesting
products they have sent me their newest
mod matte mini today so we're gonna be
taking it through its paces extensive
testing so we can give you a full view
and let you know whether or not this new
product is worth your money
Noorie always jumpin up on the table so
you guys might be able to tell but we've
got the original gamers Nexus mod Matt
here on the table don't worry we will be
doing a comparison to the original as
well as a huge array of comparative
tests inside though got some packaging
accessories oh look Steve's trying to
butter me up with one of the gamers
Nexus pint glasses here which I'll have
to do a separate video on comparing the
performance of this to my pint glasses
which do hold more liquid than the
gamers Nexus version they've got some
gilding going on in the outside there
but of course we are not gonna be fooled
or tricked by flashy packaging here
we're all about performance inside the
package we have a thermally printed
label has the gamers Nexus logo on it as
well as my name and address
gamers Nexus logo looks a little
pixelated I'm gonna say not quite as
sharp of printing as we might come to
expect there so obviously that's
disappointing right from the get-go so
if I'm at itself we have some elastic
straps boom this is our first test first
test of course gonna be a flatness
reflexivity index so as we can see laid
flat on the table we have some curling
at the corners not quite laying flat so
as was also included in the original mod
mat we have an anti-static wrist band
here which is a nice add-on I gotta give
them credit for that it has this piece
which you will connect to something that
is grounded yeah this little contact
point right there and you take the wrist
strap itself you can use this alligator
clip to clip it to something or you can
just plug in right there once you have
this fixed grounding piece which you can
then attach to your desk somewhere then
of course the thermally conductive part
goes like that should make contact with
your skin to make sure that you are
electrically discharged before you work
on any sensitive electronic components
I'd love to see some more
interoperability here I'll
clip you know it could connect right
there that would be that'd be useful in
my mind so natural rubber also known as
india-rubber we're all probably pretty
familiar with but it is formed from
polymers of the organic compound
isoprene normally it is produced in
Thailand as well as India all that
information can obviously be referenced
in the footnotes for today's video but I
want to get back to reflectivity or when
it comes to the refractive index of a
property when you're talking about a
wavefront interfacing with the media so
that is refracted at an equal and
opposite angle we're talking about
multiple factors here we have thermal
radiation and that comes in the form of
light emissivity and we also have
infrared lights so there's stuff you can
see and stuff you can't see I wasn't as
noticeable to me upon first inspection
of the product but I feel like we're
dealing with a fair amount of integrated
tessellation here with this accounting
for the rocky terrain naturally you
would want to go with Bonetti defense in
that case but the would expect the enemy
to attack with kappa fair but as
expected in that case the values tend to
be well over 9000 but when it comes to
the fundamentals here I think it gets
back to what the definition of Nexus is
a series of things multiple things that
are connected together and obviously
there's there's nothing connected to
this of course at that point I had to
interject and put my foot down because
if I paid for the meal then obviously
I'm going to take the doggie bag home
now we've covered a lot of information
in this introductory section which will
all be digitized placed in a compendium
and then buried in a time capsule for
the next 200 years when it will be
resurrected when humanity has evolved to
the next plane of existence but for now
I think we can move on to the testing
section and have a bunch of numbers to
share with you here our first test is
flatness and uniformity this is a mod
mat and of course a mat should be
something as flat if you have a mat on
your front door for example and it curls
up at the corners well it's going to be
easy to trip over in a similar situation
if you're building a computer and your
mat is not flats well we can't have any
of that cat in the hat' at the same time
when it comes to uniformity of the
surface area we have some grooves and
ridges here provides a bit of texture
and actually that is a good thing for a
mat because as you have products on it
you don't want them to be slipping and
sliding around however the grain here is
obviously slightly askance a bit askew
you might say that might lead to a
visual conflict which could then confuse
the user which then of course would lead
to damaging your
opponents our next test is still in
development we probably need one or two
thousand more passes at it before we can
call it completely scientific but it
involves dropping a handful of screws
and other components onto the mat in
order to determine how quickly they can
be picked up because reflectivity of the
surface area is something that can lead
to eye strain and of course locating
your parts on the mat surface itself is
going to be very important when it comes
to efficiency the downside here is that
over here on the area where you're
supposed to be setting your screws and
everything we actually have a higher
reflectivity index and although this
does make it easy to locate the screws
there we could be looking at long term
eye strains so something that perhaps
some blue blocking lenses might account
for or of course just don't stare
directly at the mom mat itself no no I
just did
next we're analyzing the mod map many on
the accuracy of the printed information
that's on the mat itself and here we
have some useful information we have a
layout of a graphics card we have the
die shots of both Turing and Pascal so
ten series as well as 20 series and
video GPUs and we have a Vega 56 and 64
here now I would argue that the Vega 56
and 64 is practically useless because
who uses vega's anymore
and then I have a slight issue with some
of the representative sizing some of the
components on here we have PCI Express 8
pin and 6 pin where we can see the sense
connectors as well as ground and 12
volts these are these are just huge
they're obviously much larger than they
are in real life so that could
potentially lead to confusion next we
have the all-important odor test smells
good now this last set of test numbers
is the durability test and here we have
a couple tests these are very scientific
and it involves a lot of man-hours of
work so I hope you guys appreciate the
level of effort that went into this
testing
supplemented with the stare test
and the results of these tests were
unfortunately inconclusive but that does
mean as you guys are probably hoping I
will be having a follow-up this has just
been the introductory preliminary
testing of the gamers Nexus mod met many
I will be following up with a very
extent probably like an hour long video
where I go over some additional details
on this mod mat so let you guys know
whether or not you should purchase it my
initial impressions are I'm not
impressed
obviously it's a match but it's not flat
it's got stuff on it it is mini but what
does mini really mean is that a
quantifiable thing or is it just
something that's in the abstract the
gamers Nexus is trying to use to sell us
more products and finally gamers Nexus
there were no gamers included with this
product and as far as the Nexus I don't
know what that actually means but guys
that is all for this video thank you so
much for watching I'll post a link to
this product down in the video's
description despite it of course being
horribly bad and disappointing thank you
so much again for watching hit the
thumbs up button anyway out we'll see
you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
