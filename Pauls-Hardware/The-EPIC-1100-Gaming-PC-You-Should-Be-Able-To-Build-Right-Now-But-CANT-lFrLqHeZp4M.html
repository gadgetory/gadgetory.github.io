epic PC build click the sponsor link in
the description to learn more you should
be able to buy an absolutely amazing
gaming PC for about eleven hundred
dollars right now a rig that could
handle VR 4k high refresh rate gameplay
live streaming and video editing without
breaking a sweat
so why can't we the short answer is that
a few components are ridiculously
overpriced system memory graphics cards
and to a lesser extent SSDs we should
also have seen a new generation of
graphics cards by now from Nvidia at
least but lack of competition and the
fact that current gen cards launched in
2016 are still selling for more than
they did two years ago provides team
green with little motivation to actually
do so but there is hope for the future
as we are now seeing legal action
against DRAM manufacturers for possible
price fixing and GPU prices are trending
downward so today rather than discuss
the why of all this I'm going to go over
the PC that you should be able to put
together right now
if various factors hadn't caused all
these horrific pricing bubbles and know
the purpose of this video isn't just to
frustrate you it's to remind you that
there has been a nefarious long-term
push going on in the tech industry for
higher prices and we shouldn't just
accept it we shouldn't accept GPU prices
that are only 30 to 50 bucks over MSRP
because they were a hundred or two
hundred bucks overpriced a couple months
ago
and we shouldn't think to ourselves Wow
a 16 gig Ram kit for $150 that's way
better than 200 when they were easily
able to still sell that kit for $100 and
still make a profit two years ago
actually hold on I'm double-checking my
July 2016 monthly build and here is a 16
gig Ripjaws kit for $70 so this has
affected me too I look at the prices of
PC components all the time and this
creeping normalcy of high prices has
also affected me the norm right now
shouldn't be this it should be the PC
I'm about to describe to you that system
I'm going to be using as a base
for comparison is my July 2016 build a
$1,200 build for my monthly builds
series and 1200 bucks is kind of the
baseline price I've been going for for a
higher-end gaming system not like super
high-end crazy expensive but a
reasonable price that someone might
invest in a computer that they're going
to use for gaming as well as other tasks
to everything on this parts list is
still available and if you buy it right
now this is the price one thousand five
hundred and fifty dollars two years
later I'm going with ballpark dollar
amounts for my theoretical $1100 build
and I'm not choosing specific parts for
the most part but I wanted to start out
with three components that's not much
blame can be cast upon the case the
power supply the motherboard really
haven't seen too much price fluctuation
over the past couple years so a
reasonable layout of parts for a case
power supply and motherboard can be seen
in my parts list for my May 2018 nine
hundred dollar build about 50 bucks for
a power supply can get you a decent 550
watt job that will handle just about any
graphics card you can throw at it's a
$70 case we'll get you a nice case of
course you can get cases cheaper but 70
bucks is a good price range for
something that has a nice set of
features and also looks pretty finally
for a motherboard and I'm basing this on
current prices of x4 70 motherboards
that just launched about a hundred and
forty bucks you can get a decent
entry-level overclocking motherboard not
gonna have all the bells and whistles
but will get the job done just fine so
now let's talk about the parts that have
actually changed and made a pretty big
difference over the past couple years in
2016 we all had to be happy with a fork
or four thread CPU from Intel like the
6600 K for about 230 dollars they had a
fork or eight thread option for about a
hundred bucks more than that but who
wants to pay all that money when you're
trying to get by with a reasonably
priced PC success story from the past
couple years is the AMD risin launch
which started with the rise in seven
CPUs in March 2017 followed up with
risin 5 launched in April 2017 and one
year later April 2018 we have rise in
two CPUs launched just last month and
for your 230 bucks you now get six cores
and twelve threads 12 threads versus
four threads is a really nice jump in
raw compute performance for your CPU and
it's a perfect new
thing to happen since the rise of game
streaming and the necessary video
transcoding and editing that might go
along with it people are using their
computers for more than just gaming
these days you can even get a 6 core CPU
from Intel now on their main stream
platform in the form of an 80 400 or an
80 600 K but you still need to pay $100
premium on top of that if you want your
hyper threading the next component is
storage and fortunately storage pricing
has been recovering much more quickly
than RAM or GPU pricing and I'm happy to
say that you can once again get a 500
gig class SATA SSD for just over $100
even just under under $100 if you go for
this team drive right here and you can
even get a 250 gig class drive for about
60 to 70 ish dollars flipping back to
2016 my SanDisk SSD plus 480 gig was 110
dollars so this is pretty much back
where it was two years ago so there
hasn't been a whole lot of progress but
it is still good next up is system
memory so let's take a cold hard look at
what memory has been up to recently keep
in mind that memory is inelastic it is
absolutely a requirement for a modern
gaming PC you could get by without a GPU
temporarily if you use an APU for
example you can even limp your system
along with a mechanical hard drive
rather than an SSD although you might
vomit everywhere every time you boot up
but for now you've got to have memory PC
part picker keeps trends lists for
memory as well as other components so if
we go down here to take a look at some
ddr4 2400 this is the average price for
a 4 by 4 gig kit an average price listed
here tends to be a little bit more than
you can actually buy it for because it's
looking at the whole range of memory
options but even though this isn't going
back far enough it's only going back to
about November 2016 we can see the
gradual steady rise of this kit getting
well over 200 bucks before settling back
down just a little bit to around the
$200 range fortunately though we can
reference back to my monthly builds
video from a couple years ago to see
that this g.skill ripjaws 5 series kit
was available for only $70 how much does
it cost now one hundred and eighty
dollars a one hundred and ten dollar
price jump for this same kit of memory
so in my theoretical build I have
theoretical really cheap memory - I'm
gonna take this base price of $70
figure you probably want some RGB Ram as
well so let's knock it up to $80
we'll do a generous $80 premium for your
16 gig RGB memory kits I really hope
that the lawsuits or whatever other
factors are going on right now take
effect soon and prices drop further than
what they have right now because what
we're seeing right now is a bit of a
drop but nowhere near down to where they
should be and now on to the GPU and
here's where we're talking about not
just what's available and overpriced
right now but what should have been and
we should have had an Nvidia next-gen
GPU launch in mid to late 2017 based on
their historical launch cadence
now when the 1000 series of GPUs
launched from Nvidia back in 2016 the
shiny new gtx 1070 was just about on par
performance wise with the 980 TI from
the previous generation and it cost
about $400 so if nvidia kept up with
their normal launch schedule it's
reasonable to expect that we should or
we could buy a next-gen card right now a
gtx 980ti performance ballpark
equivalents GPU for about $400 of course
it would be called in GTX 1170 or GTX
2070 but that was my expectation for
what we should have saw launched this
year and I'm pretty sad that it actually
didn't come to pass hopefully later this
year but that's about a year too late in
my opinion so if you add all this up you
have what should be a really really nice
build for about $1100 epic gaming
performance tons of cores and threads
for CPU heavy workloads and even more
possible performance via CPU and RAM
upgrades instead you have this my build
from July 2016 all parts still available
by the way coming in for the low low
price of one thousand five hundred and
fifty dollars instead of twelve hundred
dollars that it costs two years ago
and that's kind of sad I also consider
how this pricing situation may have
affected other PC parts 4k HDR high
refresh rate gaming monitors have been
teased for two years now but they keep
delaying the launch my suspicion is
because there's nobody to buy them
because no one has high-end gaming PC's
because they're so expensive I also have
to imagine that sales of stuff like VR
headsets and even other components like
the motherboards in the cases may have
suffered as well but my final advice to
you guys is this vote with your wallet
and be patient do everything you can to
hold off and not buy any of these
components while they're overpriced and
maybe just maybe in the summer of 2018
we'll be able to build this PC until
then hit the thumbs-up button if you
enjoyed this video subscribe if you'd
like to see more just like it and thank
you guys so much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
