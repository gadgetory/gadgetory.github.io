Nass that is network-attached storage
it's been running FreeNAS and last you
saw I got as far as assembling the
system and getting it booted up that I
went just fine fortunately but I wanted
to use my Nass for some useful tasks and
that list of tasks spoils down to four
things one is basic easy access to mass
storage on my local network at home
which is pretty much what an ass should
do two is regular backups of my
important irreplaceable personal files
like photos three is remote access so I
can download stuff while I'm off on the
road and then four is media server
capabilities I can now do all of those
things with my Nass thanks largely in
part to several videos and websites that
taught me how I'm going to walk you
through what I set up and for each topic
there's a link in the description to the
article or video that helped me figure
out all of this stuff since I'm kind of
learning as I go so feel free to check
those out down below don't accidentally
click the like button while you're down
there though as that should only be done
intentionally so mine ass is currently
deployed in my computer room connected
via a gigabit switch to my home network
for all this setup I accessed it via the
Chrome browser on my primary desktop PC
running Windows seven before I set the
NASS up to do any of my four things
though I first ran updates we're up to
FreeNAS nine point three point one now
and then I needed to create a ZFS volume
across my 4wd read for terabyte hard
drives
here is where I encountered my first
problem after going to storage volume
manager and trying to create a raid Z to
volume across my four four terabyte
drives I got an error unable to GPT
format the disk
ata three these drives are used they
were formerly in a raid 5 array and to
be honest I should have cleaned them
before installation but unfortunately
even the wipe command that you can
access under view disks in freenas
wasn't working anyway i internet
searched that error i found a website
bit fix table ee with a fix so i pulled
up the shell and FreeNAS entered the
commands listed on the site and i was
able to wipe the disks and proceed i
then pulled up volume manager i named my
volume big i dragged over my four drives
and FreeNAS auto selected raids e2 for
me which is actually the configuration
that I wanted because it means that I
will have up to two drives be able to
fail without losing data I do lose half
of my capacity though kind of like with
raid 10 so I will end up having only
terabytes of storage which should be
enough so with my big volume set up it
is time for the first thing the most
basic thing in ash should do gave
locally accessible mass storage over
your home network Wendell and Logan from
Tech Syndicate were immensely helpful
with their videos on FreeNAS here this
seems basic but it doesn't necessarily
just pop up after FreeNAS is installed I
had to create a dataset on the new
volume this one was for media like
movies TV and music so I called it media
and before I moved on I changed the
permissions to allow guest access that
made a repository on the big volume for
data and to access it over my home
network I went to sharing and then add a
windows CIFS share and then I browse
until I found that media dataset on the
big volume and then connected the two
together you can give it a unique name
here if you want it to have a different
name as it appears over your network and
don't forget again to allow guest access
keep in mind that this is the quick and
less secure method of setup you'd want
to add users and permissions and FreeNAS
for these datasets in the future rather
than just leaving them open to all
guests on the network but again this is
a fast and easy way to get set up now if
I access my home network via one of my
Windows PCs I can see my FreeNAS system
there even in it there's my newly
created media shared folder you can
create subfolders for different types of
media as you might expect so I just
started to drag and drop my movies music
and TV shows over to them and the thing
one was complete thing too is backups
and whereas I eventually want to have
another FreeNAS box in a remote location
that syncs with this one my immediate
concern was protection from viruses and
malicious software like cryptolocker
that could compromise my data tech
syndicate to the rescue once again with
their snapshots walkthrough freenas can
take snapshots of your data at regular
intervals and the snapshots are
read-only for your protection
since my media collection is replaceable
and it's also backed up elsewhere I
created a new data set called records to
use for my more important files like
African film scripts and my scandalous
partially nude selfie collection before
adding the windows CIFS share for this
data set though i jumped over to
snapshots to add a periodic snapshot
task for records I stuck with two weeks
to keep each snapshot and once a day
seemed about right so now every day the
contents of this folder will be backed
up via a snapshot and these snapshots
tab the first one popped up after a
couple minutes and after setting share
permissions I was able to access the
records folder over
network via Windows Explorer if you're
in Windows Explorer you can go to
properties and the previous versions tab
will also show me the staff shots and
allow me to restore from them if I want
to I have backups now and thing to is
completely to set up remote data access
for thing the three I used a FreeNAS
plugin for BitTorrent sync BitTorrent
sync has apps you can get for just about
anything Windows Mac Android iOS Linux
and more so once I got it running with
help directly from FreeNAS team's
YouTube channel and they're very
thorough video I can use BitTorrent sync
to synchronize data that means that I
can set up a folder on the nest with a
bunch of raw video files for example use
the BitTorrent sync GUI to pull up a
shareable key or you can also do a link
or a QR code and then I can send that to
a friend
my editor Joe who handles about three to
five videos a month for me in this case
who would load the BitTorrent sync app
on their device enter that key or scan
the QR code if it's a smartphone and
then mine ass will sync the files
directly to their device with no
middleman or cloud service needed it's
not quite the same as a service like
Dropbox and there is another plugin for
free and asked called own cloud that is
a bit more flexible for this type of
usage but since exposing your home
storage server to the Internet does
involve some security pitfalls I've
decided to set own cloud aside for
potential future investigation
BitTorrent sync will get the job done
for now and if you hadn't already
noticed I'm sparing you the installation
walkthrough for this one because there
are quite a few steps I will point out
that I've added one more drive to my
freenas rig though a 32 gig SSD that I'm
using for jails jails are basically like
quarantined areas that allow processes
to run in a safe environment separate
from the rest of the system you can
create an independent data set for a
jail on your main volume but from what
I've read using it faster SSD for jails
can help with some plugins like plex
media server aka thing for which we can
move on to now because thanks to
BitTorrent sync thing 3 is also
completed plex media server is more than
just a plugin for FreeNAS but thanks to
the plug-in you can easily set up
FreeNAS to be a plex media server I did
this with ease thanks to a great video
by byte my bits that walked me through
it and once you have a plex media server
on your network set up and attached to
your media collection you can use plex
client software to enjoy that content
from just about any device like
literally
from a Mac or a PC to a tablet to all
variety of smartphones to Xbox and
Playstation 4 even more specific devices
like amazon firetv chromecast Roku and
Nvidia shield you just have to create a
Plex account and then you have access to
what is essentially a glorified media
player but it also pulls metadata and
thumbnails from the Internet's and it
does sorting and it lets you do stuff
like seamlessly continue watching a
video from your smartphone by throwing
it up on your TV not actually throwing
up but like virtually tossing it from
one device to the other device you get
my points it even encrypts the data
between the server and the clients and
there are social sharing features that I
haven't even really messed with yet I do
not have Plex premium yet but I did get
these smartphone app for five bucks and
I already really like it it's fast and
responsive and it just seems pretty
awesome I feel like I should have tried
this out a while back to be honest but
what can you do and oh yeah thing for is
now also complete and those are four
amazing things you can do with an S
