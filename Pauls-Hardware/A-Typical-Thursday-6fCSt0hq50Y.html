where it just feels like even though
you've been doing stuff so you really
haven't gotten much done kind of like
what today's feel Mike what do you think
Doug's now that was perfect here but my
situation did give me an idea for what
to do for video today and that is to
give you guys some advice hopefully good
advice whenever I feel like I can't get
much done my solution is always to put
on some music so are you working out
here in my main living room family room
area because I don't want to have to air
conditioners on and save some
electricity and stuff I'm going to use
the new htpc setup or the
work-in-progress HTPC setup to put on
some tunes listen to some music and get
down to work and I'm going to then set
up some stuff out here on the table I
have my overhead camera rig set up here
behind me and that will be doing a
little time-lapse and I'll get some
other footage in there as well and for
you guys maybe it'll be some some
helpful motivation or maybe just
something to sit and watch well you guys
procrastinate what you might be planning
on doing today but if you do catch any
of the details of what I'm working on
access to big projects coming up that
I'm going to be setting up for today so
post in the comments let me know what
you think those projects might be and
then I'll come back at the end and let
you know how things have gone let's
check in one more time with the dogs
before I get started there is Hiro they
can take inner easy as usual but I think
we should let nori segue into the next
part of the video by lying there and
looking cute
and I am back I hope you guys have
enjoyed that a little bit of time-lapse
I've actually just been editing or
putting together that time-lapse so I
can render it out and I realized that a
lot of it was pretty much you know just
shots of this table getting set up of
course with all these test beds and then
just me sitting there for a while so I
hope it was at least somewhat
entertaining for you guys but for those
of you at the beginning of this video
who are at least attempting to figure
out what the heck all I'm doing back
here let me get down to it and explain
what exactly I've been setting up but it
is Friday now I kicked off this video on
Thursday so I have spent I want to say
eight to ten hours on Thursday and
Friday working on this whole thing
these are test beds I have three of them
actually one two and then the third one
is over on the chair over there and I'm
setting all of these up very
specifically and this is for those of
you guys who are possibly trying to
guess what I was working on so I could
test these guys out these are two ACS
gtx 980ti Strix graphics cards and I am
going to be using these in my next water
tools build the recreation of the build
known as Arctic panic because I want to
give these the best home I possibly can
I
needed to test to see which platform was
going to be the best most suitable home
for them right now and it's not really
an easy question there's a good amount
of testing out there on SLI 1080p is but
I wanted to test for myself so I set up
an X $2.99 system right here I also set
up an AM for system over here with an
1800 X and across there 6 0 so I could
test that out and then of course I could
not go without testing a 7700 K so
that's my Z 270 testbed which is right
over here and I've been talking those
tiny guys all around to get them in this
different systems and I'm not quite done
yet actually I am most of the way down
hey let me turn the system on most of
the way then but right now I've been
doing tests with the 7740 X as you might
be able to tell right now because only
two of these RAM sticks have lit up it's
not using this out of bank right now so
7740 X I was able to overclock 5.1
yoghurts but all this is going to be
covered in my next video or actually go
over all these benchmarks and stuff next
on my to-do list is to pop in a higher
court count option and see what that
does for me so I do have the 78 20x here
so that's going to next and of course
I'm overclocking the snot out of
everything to give my graphics cards the
best possible chance they have at
performing now the reason I've made such
a mess out here in my dining room and
ran cables across the ground and
everything is because I wanted to do
everything fresh
so all these test beds have kind of been
freshly put together I wiped the SSDs
that were on there I did clean installs
of Windows 10 on all of them I've
actually got the creators update
installed even so we're going as new as
possible and then of course latest video
drivers and the drivers available from
the manufacturers website latest a GC a
date for the AMD system and all that
good stuff just wanted to give these
systems the best run they had possible
at actually getting the most performance
out of the 1080 is as I possibly could
then of course I had to bring my 4k
monitor here - that isn't all I did
though aside from running Ethernet
cables all across my home I did get the
chance that you might have seen towards
the beginning to swap this
passive cooler that I did the video on
just a few days back actually on to my
home theater PC my home theater PC is
still just all sitting right here on top
of my subwoofer but this means it's
pretty much all passive now
well not pretty much all but mostly also
I've got a 1080 I ran out of 1080 1080
ice firstworldproblems I know so if I
put a 1080 for the wind to from EVGA in
here and this does have the fan stop
mode although only one of the fans is
actually fans stopping right now but
when it's not doing anything when it's
just chilling those are both stop so
basically basically be no fan spinning
on this at all the system has actually
been doing a really good job just doing
htpc stuff for us in the past week or so
though my next thing I needed to do
really is get rid of that mechanical
drag because that does make some noise
from time to time then of course I'm
going to wall mount this um and more on
that hopefully very soon and that final
bit at ease is going to be these right
here which I haven't really done
anything with other than taking the
boxes and setting them here as a teaser
for you guys but Rison 3 yes I actually
have both of them and he sent these over
so I've got the rise in 3 1300 X and
I've got the rise in 3 1200 and I'm
still figuring out exactly how I'm going
to handle coverage of these guys because
expectations are already pretty well in
line these are basically going to be
like rising 5 quad cores with
hyper-threading or with simultaneous
multi-threading turned off but these are
going to allow people to build Rison
based systems for a much lower price
because these are only supposed to be in
the low 100 dollar range so I'm taking
these all right there we go alright so
coming soon Rison 3 coverage - did you
guys notice my my SLI bridge here my
hand but I bandwidth SLI bridge from ROG
I think it's pretty fancy
it actually has RGB it's supposed to be
a touch pad but I think right now it's
just defaulting because they're supposed
to be able to touch it to change the
colors but it also has a lead so you can
take it connect it up directly to a
motherboard so that will be a nice
finisher for the RGB Ness of my build
and yes when I do actually build the
system
I'm not going this is this motherboard I
just wanted to test up with overclocking
through the MSI
x2 99 gaming m7 ACK but I will be using
an asus board for this build so
everything will match up at least as far
as the lighting is concerned and guys
that's going to need to do it for
today's video because like I said I need
to get back to testing with this rig and
swap that CPU in an overclock it and
finish off my round of benchmarks with
the 1080i and SLI and then of course
they need to get those rise and three
CPUs installed so I can start testing
those out as well I've got a lot of
benchmarking still ahead of me but I
hope you guys have enjoyed this video
although it was just sort of a day or
two in my life out here doing tests and
benchmarking in the dining room again
I'm working out here because it's really
hot in California it's the summer right
now so working in the garage means I
have to run two air conditioners and
just trying to save a little power and
also it's a little bit more pleasant out
here when it comes to the dead of summer
and how hot it gets but anyway thanks
you guys for watching this video hit the
thumbs up button if you did enjoy it and
leave me comments in the comments
section let me know what you think is
going to happen what the outcome will be
of my 1080p is li experiments because
I'm curious to find out myself thanks
again for watching and we'll see you
guys in the next video</div></div><div class="container-fluid"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div></body></html>
